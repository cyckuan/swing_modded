DRIVEN BY DISTRACTION  
 2 OF OPEN LEADERS HAVE THOUGHTS ELSEWHERE  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ Sometimes distractions can be a very good
thing. Especially when a golfer of considerable reputation is
competing in the U.S. Open with the onus of having never won a
major championship weighing him down.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Mickelson and David Duval, who own 24 victories between
them, have rehashed their failures in the majors more than enough
times. Both grimace slightly when the question is asked.
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps it was refreshing to both young men that the hordes
of reporters covering the 99th national championship at Pinehurst
No. 2 were preoccupied with other things on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   For Mickelson, whose wife is expecting the couple's first child
this month, the baby questions offer a pleasant alternative. For
Duval, who suffered second-degrees burns on his right hand in a
teapot accident last week, his blistered thumb and forefinger have
been the perfect remedy.
</P>
<P>
   Both are tied for the first-round lead at 3-under 67, as are
Paul Goydos and Billy Mayfair, who, like Mickelson, hails from
Scottsdale and played at Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   The typical pressure that comes at a major championship _ at
least so far _ has been minimal for Mickelson and Duval, thanks to
everything else that's going on in their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``That could be the case, in that I have something to take my
mind off a major championship,'' admitted Mickelson, whose caddie
is carrying a beeper just in case his wife, Amy, goes into labor.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson, a licensed pilot, said that should he hear the beep,
he is ``outta here,'' in the air headed for Scottsdale. He might
even fly the plane, provided he is as steady in the cockpit as he
was on this day, when he holed five birdies to offset two bogeys
and rescued himself with four big saves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably fly (the plane). But I've also got a co-pilot
who can fly,'' said Mickelson, who promised that no matter what his
position is on the leader board, the birth of his daughter ``is not
something I'm going to miss.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval said his life has been focused because he has stayed away
from the course for the most part until the real deal finally got
under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I just unpacked, worked out, played with the cat,
watched TV,'' he said of his preparation. ``That's what I did.
Pretty boring, I guess, but I rather enjoyed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite some tenderness in his index finger, Duval never bogeyed
on a day that began in a pouring rain and ended under sunny skies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rain really softened it up,'' Duval said of Pinehurst No.
2, which managed to show its teeth around the greens as the opening
round wore on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to get more difficult as the week
progresses.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfair, who made four birdies and a lone bogey, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled to death to shoot 3 under on this course,''
Mayfair said. ``Once it dries up, those shots around the green are
really going to become complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they were tough enough the first time around, as
players seemed to pull out every club in their bag. More than one
chip was chunked, and numerous putts rolled up the false fronts
only to return at the feet of their senders.
</P>
<P>
   Of the pre-tournament favorites, Tiger Woods was right there
after rolling in birdies on the last two holes for a 68.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm feeling very happy, because if you saw me play today, you
would say there's no way he could have shot that number,'' said
Woods, who almost holed out a 9-iron at the 11th hole.
</P>
<P>
   John Daly also made a surprise appearance at 2 under. Daly, who
blew out of the gate with three straight birdies, nearly had a
share of the lead except for a misfire on the last hole, where his
drive ricocheted all the way from the pines on the right into the
rough on the left, leading to a bogey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in about as much shock as everybody else right now,'' said
the often-ridiculed bad boy of golf, who still commands a
considerable fan base.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few bad drives, but I was really pleased. Coming in here, I
felt like the whole game was just gone. I had no confidence or
expectations. But knowing I could pretty much hit driver on most of
the holes helped an awful lot.''
</P>
<P>
   On a day of distractions, Daly admitted that he might have been
the biggest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just the greatest feeling in the world,'' he said as he
got a rousing ovation coming to the 18th green. ``The fans have
stuck with me through thick and thin, and it was so nice to give
them a good round. I haven't figured out quite why they do it, but
I love them for it.''

MICKELSON READY FOR CHILD RUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. - Some couples starting a family share the good
news by announcing, ``We're pregnant!''
</P>
<P>
   Medically speaking, this is highly unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   Being pregnant isn't a shared activity, like playing mixed
doubles tennis or bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Mickelson isn't carrying a child on alternate months, or
even one day a week. ``He's'' not going to give birth soon.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Amy, is.
</P>
<P>
   Phil is golfing this week. He hopes to win the U.S. Open before
his beeper goes off. In the event it does between now and Sunday's
final round _ the beeper in his caddy's pocket will signal Amy is
in labor _ Mickelson vows he will drop his driver or putter or
whatever club is in his hand and take immediate paternity leave,
sprinting off the course and withdrawing from the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   A private plane is waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson, a licensed pilot, has the emergency getaway planned.
He figures he can fly home and be at his wife's bedside at a
Scottsdale hospital in five hours, 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I don't want to miss,'' Mickelson said of the
arrival of the couple's first child.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Open co-leader confirmed his plans to a predominantly
male audience of sports writers. Many are married, with children.
Reaction ranged from admiring nods to looks that said, ``Are you
NUTS?!''
</P>
<P>
   A guy from Cleveland wondered what Shawn Kemp would do.
</P>
<P>
   Hands in the interview room went up.
</P>
<P>
   Phil, say you're tied for the lead after the third round. What
if the beeper goes off?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to be there,''
Mickelson replied, unwaveringly. ``The U.S. Open takes place every
year.''
</P>
<P>
   But what if if you're leading Sunday going to the 15th hole? You
mean you still would walk away? The winner's check is $625,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I dunno,'' Mickelson said, hedging. The former ASU
All-American lifted a hand and rubbed his forehead, as if he felt a
migraine coming on.
</P>
<P>
   How about this scenario. It's the 72nd hole. All you've got to
do to win the Open is finish No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's the last green and there's five minutes left?''
Mickelson asked. He paused, mulling the hypothetical. He said he
would putt out. ``I think five minutes wouldn't make a bit of
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   One hopes for Lefty's sake that daughter Amanda arrives on
schedule (June 30) and he stays to play all four rounds. The Open
course is one of his favorites, calling it ``the best test of golf
I've played in a major championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Pinehurst No. 2 puts a premium on the short game, and
Mickelson's mastery around the greens is his strength, as he
demonstrated in shooting 3-under 67. In the opening round, he holed
a 25-foot chip for one birdie. He made a 30-foot putt for another.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson's accomplishments and shortcomings are well
documented. He won three NCAA titles. He won his first pro
tournament in Tucson as an amateur. Two years ago, he became the
youngest player since Jack Nicklaus to win 11 PGA Tour titles.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson is a multimillionaire. His Web site touts his
``integrity, intelligence, charisma and good looks'' and describes
him as ``one of the most respected under-30 athletes in the world.
. . .''
</P>
<P>
   But the game's best left-handed player still hasn't won a major.
He has come tantalizingly close several times.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is off to a fast start on a course he likes, and his
confidence level is high.
</P>
<P>
   Can he win? Sure. But winning the U.S. Open or any major
championship is is some ways like being in labor. You sweat. You
strain. Supporters keep telling you, ``C'mon, you can do it.'' When
you deliver, words can't describe the relief and pure joy. What a
story it would be if Phil Mickelson wins the Open.
</P>
<P>

STARS SHUT OUT SABRES, 2-0, TO TAKE LEAD IN STANLEY CUP FINALS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The struggle for the Stanley Cup could end as soon as
Saturday, when the Dallas Stars could win their first championship
in the team's 32-year history. They scored a 2-0 victory on
Thursday night over the Buffalo Sabres to take a 3-2 lead in the
National Hockey League finals.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Modano, playing with a damaged left wrist, assisted on both
Dallas goals and performed with elan. The Stars carried a 1-0 lead
until late in the third period, when Pat Verbeek, after taking a
pass from Richard Matvichuk, scored the second goal with a fake and
a backhanded shot past the Buffalo goalie Dominik Hasek. Modano's
work with the puck sprang the two-on-one rush from the other end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Modano was our X-factor,'' said Dallas Coach Ken Hitchcock.
The coach said he called his star center at home on Wednesday night
to give him a pep tralk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a pretty good relationship,'' Hitchcock said. ``I'm
able to say some things candidly and openly to him. It was a phone
call of support. He took it to heart. He went about his business
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Darryl Sydor scored for Dallas early in the second
period. Hasek stopped 19 shots, while the Stars' Ed Belfour had 23
saves in recording the shutout.
</P>
<P>
   If the Stars win the title, it will be the first time since the
New York Rangers won the cup in 1994 that the regular-season
champion won the post-season tournament. This is the sixth season
in Texas for the team, which was formed as the Minnesota North
Stars in the expansion of 1967. But the series is shifting back to
Buffalo for Game 6, and the Sabres have lost only one of nine home
games in this two-month tournament. Game 7, if necessary, will be
in Dallas on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Although close and tense, Thursday night's game was the least
entertaining of what has been a well-contested series. Each team
was stifled by tight checking. Because of mediocre ice conditions,
passing and playmaking were difficult. Whistles and face-offs were
frequent in a game that took more than three hours to complete.
``It is really bad ice,'' said James Patrick, Buffalo's veteran
defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   In the final 31 seconds, the Sabres were on the power play and
had another extra attacker because they pulled Hasek and replaced
him with one more skater. Although the Sabres kept the puck in the
Dallas zone, they never came close to scoring. In a scrap with
Dallas defenseman Derian Hatcher at the final buzzer, Buffalo
defenseman Rhett Warrener appeared to injure his right leg and was
helped off the ice by his teammates.

DODGERS SAY TALKS WITH TRIBE PROGRESSING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LES POLK  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Fort McDowell Mohave-Apache Indian Community and
the Los Angeles Dodgers are moving closer to serious negotiations
on a deal that would lure the team from Florida to Arizona for
spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials and representatives of the Fort McDowell
community east of Scottsdale met Wednesday on the reservation in
their continuing informal talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a step forward,'' said Fred Coons, business development
director for the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   For the time being, the tribal proposal does not include
housing, which the Dodgers would like because they have it at
Dodgertown in Vero Beach, their spring home for 51 years.
</P>
<P>
   But Coons said again that housing alone will not make or break a
deal.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that the Dodgers will leave Dodgertown this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   The tribe and the Dodgers outlined their positions on various
issues Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good discussion,'' Coons said.
</P>
<P>
   He described the ongoing talks as a ``collaborative effort'' and
not negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Fort McDowell is offering a spring training complex with a
12,500-seat stadium, a cloverleaf practice facility, locker rooms,
batting cages and other amenities.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal officials could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also are talking with Vero Beach area officials who
want to keep the team. Their effort suffered a serious setback when
Florida Gov. Jeb Bush vetoed $7.5 million in state aid to the
project last month.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers no longer want to be the only major league team to
own their complex, preferring a more financially beneficial lease
setup. And Dodgertown is in need of major renovations and expansion
to bring it up to speed with state-of-the-art complexes such as
those in Peoria and Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   Coons said talks with the tribe will continue on a regular basis
and that the team still has no timetable for resolving the issue. &QL;

NEW ATMOSPHERE PLEASES PLESAC  
 TRADE FROM TORONTO REJUVENATES RELIEVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD OBERT  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Three games, five batters, five outs.
</P>
<P>
   Life on the mound couldn't be any sweeter for Dan Plesac, who
walks around Bank One Ballpark as if on air.
</P>
<P>
   Since being traded last weekend from the Toronto Blue Jays,
where he struggled, to the Diamondbacks, where he's flourished, the
veteran left-hander has been in baseball heaven.
</P>
<P>
   Retiring to a horse ranch in Indiana can wait.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-year-old's youthful enthusiasm is back _ relishing the
role of zeroing in on left-handed hitters, looking forward to the
possibility of pitching in the postseason for the first time in his
14-year career, anticipating the next pressure-packed moment he's
handed the ball.
</P>
<P>
   He calls the Diamondbacks' experience, so far, ``overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see how his head is come Saturday,'' Manager Buck
Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Plesac may have gotten to face an Atlanta Brave or two.
It's not quite the same as a diet of Florida Marlins left-handers.
</P>
<P>
   But Plesac, acquired in a deal that sent shortstop Tony Batista
and right-handed reliever John Frascatore to Toronto, has seen his
share of difficult situations, with runners on base in three tight
games.
</P>
<P>
   His first chance was Sunday in Anaheim, when he came on in the
10th inning to face Garrett Anderson with runners on first and
second. Plesac struck him out on four consecutive sliders, and the
Diamondbacks ended up winning, 3-1, in 13 innings.
</P>
<P>
   That after flying all day across the country to get to Anaheim
for his first game with the Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it was time to tighten the belt up and get after it,''
he said. ``It seems like when I got here, it was a perfect fit for
me. It was like a wake-up call of, `Forget about the last two
months. The only thing that matters is right now.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter realizes Plesac no longer possesses the 98 mph
fastball he had when compiling 95 saves for the Milwaukee Brewers
from 1986 to '89.
</P>
<P>
   Plesac's primary role here will be facing left-handers in tight
situations. There will be games when he may pitch to one batter.
</P>
<P>
   Plesac, 6 feet 5, still can get up to 91-92 mph with his
fastball, and he can still tie up a left-hander with a nasty
slider.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he was 0-3 with an 8.34 ERA in 22 innings to start
the season, left-handers were hitting 9 for 47 (.191) against him,
struck out 15 times and didn't have an extra-base hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was a different mind-set, as opposed to worrying long
term, thinking, `How long am I going to keep on struggling? When is
it going to end?' '' Plesac said. ``I was like, `I can't worry
about that now. I'm at a new place. They expect me to get a job
done. Let's get it done.' ''
</P>
<P>
   On the flight to Anaheim, Plesac simply recalled the line from
his first big-league pitching coach, Don Rowe: ``Sometimes you get
paralysis from analysis.''
</P>
<P>
   For Plesac, it meant less reliance on video.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at so much tape that you don't even know what you're
looking at after a while,'' Plesac said. ``Sometimes you get so
much information that you forget the most important thing, and that
is to keep the game simple, take the ball in your hand and put it
in that glove where that catcher is holding it. If it's a fastball
in, get it to that glove.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   He's feeling so at home that he's spent the week searching for a
house.
</P>
<P>
   His in-laws live in Glendale, so his wife, Leslie, is pretty
happy about the trade, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely a perfect fit,'' Plesac said. ``I feel like I
can bring something to the table, a small piece of the puzzle to
help this team.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade was criticized by some who looked at Plesac's overall
numbers in the season's first two months, but Arizona reliever
Darren Holmes knew better. He had teamed with Plesac for two years
in Milwaukee in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes said he had heard four days before that the trade for
Plesac was in the works.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy don't need no money,'' Holmes said. ``He's playing
because he wants to win. He wants to go to the World Series. You
get him in the environment where he's got that shot, I think this
is the type of person who is going to pitch. He's pitching in
situations where he's supposed to be pitching in now.''
</P>
<P>
   Plesac came to spring training with thoughts that this would
probably be his last year. He said he went to camp in the best
shape of his life _ down 15 pounds to 217. His shoulder felt great.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard reasons I was throwing poorly was because I lost too
much weight and I pitched better when I was heavier,'' Plesac said.
``After a while, I was just so glad that I didn't listen to that
nonsense. I said, `I'm going to keep grinding, something good is
going to happen to me.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Now he's thinking maybe he's got a few more years left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't put into words what a shot in the arm this has been
for me,'' he said.

COLUMBINE DEBATE TEAMS COPES WITH LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By M. BRADFORD GRABOWSKI  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ Brooks Brown would rather be identified as the
best debater in Phoenix Friday than as the controversial friend of
the two Littleton, Colo., gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   But even at the National Forensic League's Desert Sun National
Speech and Debate Tournament in Tempe, Ariz., this week, the recent
Columbine High School graduate couldn't escape the day in April
when he lost four of his friends.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is one of 2,300 high school students from around the
nation participating in the tournament, which ends Friday. Past
competitors include Richard Nixon, James Dean and Oprah Winfrey.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Brown is the tournament's best-known competitor _ for
reasons he and his teammates would rather forget.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was casual friends with the two gunmen. Two of his
teammates were killed.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, he amazed his fellow competitors by taking on the
issue of whether parents should be held responsible for their
children's actions. Currently, the Littleton attackers' parents are
facing a multimillion-dollar lawsuit for their teenage sons'
actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stood up and said, `I know the parents of the two kids who
committed the attack,' '' Chris Hajduk of Loyola Academy in Chicago
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more of an emotional appeal than anything that parents
shouldn't be held responsible. It was a very powerful speech. He
was on the verge of crying. It was the best speech I've ever heard
in debate. People didn't want to argue against it. How could you
respond to it?''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said other competitors were nervous about talking to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people here have misconceptions,'' Brown said,
explaining that he and the two attackers weren't as close as
reported by news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was worried about offending him,'' said Daniel Hansen
of Washburn Rural High School in Topeka, Kan. ``You kind of had to
guard yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who was questioned about his relationship with attackers
Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold after the incident, declined comment
about that. But he couldn't stop talking about one of the victims,
slain teammate Daniel Mauser, 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that I'm here for Dan,'' Brown said on competing at
nationals. ``He was my most favorite little kid in debate. I love
that little kid. He kept telling me how much he loved watching me
debate. I want to do the best that I can (for him).''
</P>
<P>
   He and other Columbine speech and debate team members competing
at this week's tournament said losing teammates Mauser and
18-year-old Rachel Scott was like losing family members.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very hard, we miss them,'' said Columbine coach
Paula Reed. ``There's an empty spot. We lost two family members.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed said that speech and debate teammates tend to form strong
friendships, so losing team members is very painful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of any other activity where kids are together
for 14 hours straight on a weekend,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And between competing there are hourlong breaks and there's
nothing to do except talk about things like philosophy and life
with each other. It forces the students to become close.''
</P>
<P>
   Another team member, Sara Martin, said the competition has been
a welcome break from the emotional stress all Columbine students
have endured.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been able to have fun this week,'' she said. ``We
haven't been distracted by what happened, but it is a part of who
we are and will continue to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Reed said that everyone has been supportive of her team. Private
donations helped fund the three students and two coaches trip to
nationals and a moment of silence was held in memory of the two
victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people come up to me and tell me, `I just don't know
what to say to you,' '' Reed said. ``And I tell them, 'Anything you
say tells me that you're concerned.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Three members of the team said they were in the building when
the shootings began. They declined to go into details.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just ready to move on,'' said coach Martha Benham.
``What happened is past us. Now, we need to address `What can we do
from here to prevent this from happening again?' '' &QL;

 By EDDIE SEFKO  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
PINEHURST, N.C. _ Consistency has never threatened to inflict
itself on John Daly's life.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether it was his war with alcohol addiction, serious gambling
problems, a troubled personal life or his erratic golf game, Daly
always has found ways to keep people guessing, often to his
detriment.
</P>
<P>
   So when Daly was merrily stringing together par after par on the
back nine Thursday at the U.S. Open, you just knew he couldn't keep
the Nick Faldo impersonation going.
</P>
<P>
   Daly finally cracked with a regrettable swing on the 18th tee
that led to a walk-away bogey. But even that mistake couldn't take
the sheen off of perhaps Daly's finest moment since his
much-publicized battle with the bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Daly shot a 2-under-par 68 at Pinehurst No. 2, and only his
18th-hole miscue cost him a share of the lead in the 99th Open. But
on a day when a softened-up Pinehurst teased and tempted but never
let anyone get in a clean cut at Donald Ross' venerable course,
Daly put himself in the middle of the spotlight with three birdies
to start his round and an uncharacteristic string of pars near the
end.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a guy who was a combined 24 over par in his previous
five rounds at three tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm about as much in shock as everybody else is,'' Daly said.
``The thing with me is I don't know who's going to show up in the
next round. That's the way it's been all year.
</P>
<P>
   ``But right now, I just want to soak this day up and pat myself
on the back.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodness knows, he has earned it.
</P>
<P>
   Before the weekend is done, David Duval might be the toast of
the tournament. He is part of a four-way tie for the lead at
3-under-par 67. Phil Mickelson, Billy Mayfair and Paul Goydos also
shot 67 to lead a parade of 23 players who broke par-70 in the
first round.
</P>
<P>
   But you get the feeling a lot of people are rooting for Daly to
hold it together this week.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, he has been the soap opera we love to
watch on the PGA Tour. Two of his four victories have been at
majors. But since the '95 British Open, Daly's misfortune has
merited more headlines than his golf game.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody knew exactly the depths to which Daly sank at times. But
Thursday, he made it clear he has seen more bad days than good, and
certainly more bad ones than anybody should have to handle.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with the stoppage of alcohol intake, Daly has gone
through a series of other addictions. First, it was gambling.
</P>
<P>
   From 1993 to November 1996, Daly's gambling losses mounted
faster than his list of missed cuts on tour. And that's fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be specific, I lost $51 million and I won $42 million,''
Daly said. ``So I was down $9 million. The most I owed at any one
time was about $3 million $2.8 million, I think. One of my favorite
things was to go to a casino and see how much money the dealer at
the $10,000 table had. If they had $340,000 at the table, I wanted
to see if I could get all of it. That's the ultimate feeling when
they have to call for more money.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they took a lot more from me than I took from them.''
</P>
<P>
   So much so that Daly was, and is, on the verge of financial
ruin. To pay his bills, Daly needs to earn about $40,000 per month.
That includes alimony and child support, in addition to house
payments and other expenses. He already has sold his Mercedes and a
home in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've still got houses in Arkansas and Memphis,'' he said.
``But I'm probably going to have to sell the one in Memphis.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was in financial trouble at the moment, Daly said:
``A little.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't get completely out of debt with the many casinos he
frequented until he went through his second alcohol-rehabilitation
stint, after which he signed an endorsement contract with Callaway.
As part of the contract Daly signed, the golf-equipment company
took care of $1.8 million in debts Daly owed to casinos.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drinking is a lot more of a temptation now,'' Daly said,
``because I don't have any money to gamble with now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when I'm playing good, the cravings are there. So you can
imagine what they're like when I'm playing bad. The cravings are as
bad now as when I first quit. It scares the living hell out of me
and scares the people around me, which it should. I don't know why
it's harder for me. But it is. And I know there are a lot of people
out there who know what I'm going through.''
</P>
<P>
   Without drinking and gambling, Daly has resorted to other binges
to satisfy some of his urges. The main thing is food _ chocolate,
to be exact.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started with M&AMP;Ms, and now it's Oreos,'' he said.
``Basically, if it's chocolate, I don't care what it is, I'll eat
it.''
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate the problem, Daly revealed how he planned to
celebrate Thursday's grand play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six cheeseburgers from McDonald's, a bag of Oreos and a carton
of milk,'' he said. ``I'm going to watch SportsCenter and hopefully
see myself on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Without drinking and gambling, Daly said his closest friends
have convinced him he has to use golf as his outlet. Wrap himself
up in the game and try to get some gratification from it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when you're playing bad, it's hard to do that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Thursday will be a springboard to better times. But even
Daly admits that the round qualifies as a bolt from the blue. He
withdrew from two of his previous four tournaments and missed the
cut in the other two. He admitted the past couple of months haven't
been any fun for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect to win the U.S. Open,'' Daly said. ``I can't
sit here and say that. My game's not in that fine of a rhythm right
now, and I don't quite have the confidence. But if I could keep
doing what I'm doing, hopefully I can find the confidence to pull
it off through the week. But I don't expect to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I knew what held me back. I've worked harder this year
than I have any other year. I think I've been putting too much
pressure on myself trying to force things to happen instead of
letting them happen.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Daly just let it happen. He made 12- and 20-foot
putts on the first two holes and then hit a lob-wedge to within
five feet on the third for his quick start. He closed out the front
nine with a bogey-birdie parlay and then strung together the eight
pars before confronting the 18th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how to describe the drive on the 18th,'' he said.
``I don't know if my hand slipped or if I came down a little quick
and opened the face. But it was actually more of a good break than
a bad one. If it hadn't hit the tree, it could have gone
anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   As it was, the ball smacked a tree on the right of the fairway
and kicked into the left woods, barely 100 yards off the tee. Daly
punched into the fairway, then hit a wedge to 20 feet and
two-putted for his bogey.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the round for Daly was that he got to hit his driver
on every par-4 and par-5 except for one. Last year at The Olympic
Club in the first round, he didn't use the driver once.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was very frustrating,'' Daly said. ``Last year wasn't a
course where I needed the driver. And I believe that a major
championship should be where you have to play golf and not hit 2-,
3- or 4-irons off the tees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just really good to be able to hit the driver. I felt
like my whole game was gone coming into this week. I didn't have
any confidence or any expectations coming here. But knowing that I
could hit driver on most of the holes helped an awful lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Daly wasn't sure how he did it Thursday, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at my stats, and to hell with them,'' he said. ``If you
look at them, they're awful. And I'm 2-under somehow.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the same player who had a six-putt from eight feet two
weeks ago at the Memorial tournament. That was the lowest point in
the stretch of four tournaments where he either missed the cut or
withdrew. And he is not sure why he has played so poorly of late.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' he said. ``Maybe it's a test. That's how I'm
looking at it. I don't feel like my swing is that bad. But I just
find that I'm doubting myself a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawals were easily explained. At Colonial, too much
pollen made him miserable, and at Memorial, he was so far back
after the dreadful six-putt that Daly packed up and headed home to
his home in Memphis to prepare for the following week's tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no chance to make the cut anyway,'' he said. ``The sad
part about the six-putt is that I was actually trying on four of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   And Daly has a new putter this week, having ditched the six-putt
traitor.

HOUSE NARROWLY APPROVES WEAK GUN CONTROL MEASURE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL and FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a jolt to President Clinton and gun-control
advocates in the Democratic Party, the House late Thursday night
narrowly approved a provision to regulate sales at gun shows that
is substantially weaker than legislation passed by the Senate last
month.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, sponsored by Rep. John Dingell, a Michigan Democrat
working in conjunction with Republicans, eked through by a vote of
218 to 211. It drew the support of 173 Republicans and 45Democrats,
though most Democrats stuck with the president.
</P>
<P>
   The House then began debate early Friday morning on a stricter
gun-show measure, which was intended to supersede the Dingell
measure. The National Rifle Association has been working for weeks
to see that the House does not back the same gun regulations that
Democrats unexpectedly pushed through the Senate after the school
shootings in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   In emotional debate on Thursday night, Rep. Dick Gephardt, the
House minority leader, pleaded for the House to take a strong stand
on gun shows. He ticked off the places where deadly gunfire had
erupted in schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have Littleton and you have Georgia and you have
Arkansas and you have Oregon and you have Kentucky,'' he said,
``and you have kids killing kids in high schools, not just in
inner-cities but in suburbs all across this country, you have a
national crisis.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga.,, spoke out uncompromisingly in
favor of the constitutional right to bear arms. ``The majority of
the amendments we're debating aren't about saving lives,'' he said.
``They're about taking rights away from law-abiding citizens. What
we're talking about is gun control, and that is the wrong issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Several more gun-control measures were to be considered by the
House on Friday, but the success of the Dingell gun-show measure
threw the entire fate of the final bill in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Democrats were threatening to bolt from the final bill
because its gun-show provision is too weak, while conservatives
were saying they could oppose it if additional amendments, such as
one to raise the minimum age for the purchase of all handguns or
another to ban the import of high-capacity ammunition clips, should
pass and make the bill too strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The less gun control, the more apt it is to pass,'' said Rep.
Tom DeLay, the House minority whip. He had worked unwaveringly to
persuade conservatives to rally around Dingell's bill in order to
trump the stronger version sponsored by Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, a
New York Democrat whose husband was killed by a gunman on the Long
Island Rail Road in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Another gun-show provision sponsored by Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.,
was contained in the base bill under consideration and represented
a mid-point between the other versions.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the complicated politics on the issue, Dingell
refused to say whether he would vote for the final measure if his
amendment prevailed. ``I might or I might not,'' he told reporters
at midday, sphinx-like.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats in favor of gun control accused their opponents of
orchestrating a charade by first weakening the bill and then
preparing to vote against it. ``If Republicans cynically vote for
Dingell and against the bill then their strategy is no gun
safety,'' said Rep. Steny Hoyer, D-Md. He said Democrats were going
to have to weigh ``whether or not a small step is better than no
step.''
</P>
<P>
   The late-night showdown over the gun-show measures came
centerstage after two long days of sometimes impassioned clashes
over God, values, the entertainment industry and the Constitution.
That debate culminated early on Thursday night in passage by a vote
of 287-139 of a wide-ranging bill that would provide $1.5 billion
for fighting juvenile crime and enact tough mandatory minimum
sentences for young people in gun crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In a victory for social conservatives, the House voted 248-180
to include in the crime bill an amendment sponsored by Rep. Robert
Aderholt, R-Ala., giving states the right to allow the display of
the Ten Commandments in public places, including schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that simply posting the Ten Commandments will not
instantly change the moral charcter of our nation,'' Aderholt, the
measure's sponsor, said just before it passed. ``However, it is an
important step to promote morality and an end of children killing
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and other critics countered that
the amendment raised constitutional questions, including whether it
would pass muster on the separation of church and state. ``Whose
Ten Commandments?'' Nadler asked. ``Which version? The Catholic
version? The Protestant version? Or the Jewish version?''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday evening, long after prime time, the House turned to
the gun-control debate, which is the preferred political ground of
the Democrats. A dozen separate gun amendments were under
consideration, ranging from a measure requiring child-safety
devices to be sold with handguns to a proposal to repeal the
District of Columbia's ban on the posession of firearms.
</P>
<P>
   But the most significant showdown was over the rival measures of
varying strictness to regulate sales of weapons at gun shows, at
which collectors and hobbyists selling firearms are not now
required to conduct the kinds of background checks on buyers that
licensed dealers are.
</P>
<P>
   In a fierce lobbying blitz, Clinton arose early in Paris to
telephone four wavering Democrats: Gary Condit and Mike Thompson of
California, Marion Berry of Arkansas and Ron Kind of Wisconsin, to
urge them to vote for the gun-show amendment sponsored by Mrs.
McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is crazy for the United States to be the only advanced
country in the world that doesn't take comorehensive, sensible,
thorough steps to keep handguns out of the hands of criminals,''
Clinton told reporters in Paris, where he was attending a summit of
industrialized nations. ``It's just _ it doesn't make any sense.''
</P>
<P>
   To hammer home the point the White House sent Attorney General
Janet Reno to the Capitol late on Thursday afternoon. As the debate
neared a late evening vote, Republicans said that Clinton and the
attorney general were still calling a handful of wavering
Republicans from mostly suburban districts who could turn the
outcome either way.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association and DeLay shored up support among
conservatives for the weaker version sponsored by Dingell of
Michigan, who is a former member of the NRA board.
</P>
<P>
   All day long Dingell insisted that he was going to win. He said
that Clinton would not make headway with conservative Democrats
because ``he cost us control of the House and a lot of people
remember that.'' The Republicans won the majority in 1994, months
after Congress enacted a ban on assault weapons avidly sought by
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the NRA has largely held sway on Capitol Hill. But
after the school shootings in Littleton, the Senate last month _
with Vice President Al Gore casting the tie-breaking vote _
approved a proposal that would compel all vendors at gun shows,
licensed or unlicensed to run such checks. Law enforcment officials
are given three business days to complete the checks.
</P>
<P>
   And in debate on Thursday night, Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash.,
recalled that he had lost his seat in 1994 for favoring gun contol
and then been re-elected. ``It was bitter and it was painful,'' he
said of his election defeat. ``But I have not regreted that vote
for one minute. No congressman's seat is more important than any
child's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Dingell's amendment on gun shows differs significantly from the
Senate's. Its definition of what constitutes a gun show is narrow,
and only 24 hours would be allotted for background checks. Mrs.
McCarthy's version largely mirrors the Senate legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In other votes late Wednesday and early today the House approved
a veriety of measures signaling support, sometimes symbolic and
sometimes more concrete, for public expressions of religion. The
debate over the Ten Commandments was the most spirited.
</P>
<P>
   But the House also overwhelmingly approved measures allowing the
use of religious language in memorials on school grounds and
prohibiting discrimination against religious organizations in the
awarding of contracts to provide social services.

WITH LEITER AS POINT MAN, METS TOP CARDINALS, 4-3 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Twelve days ago at Yankee Stadium, Al Leiter helped
turn the New York Mets' fortunes around. Thursday night, after his
third successive strong pitching outing, it looks as if Leiter
might also have turned his season around.
</P>
<P>
   With help from Dennis Cook, who rescued John Franco in relief,
Leiter evened his record at 5-5 in the Mets' 4-3 victory over the
St. Louis Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Franco, the Mets' 38-year-old closer, came on in the ninth with
a 4-1 lead, faced four batters, and _ with no help from a
questionable safe call at third base _ did not get anyone out.
</P>
<P>
   Franco had converted 16 of 17 save opportunities this year. But
he did not blow this one because Cook bailed him out. After Franco
allowed a 2-run single to Fernando Tatis, Cook came on and struck
out Ray Lankford, retired Willie McGee on a fly out and then
induced Eli Marrero to a foul popout to leave the tying run on
third and the winning run at first.
</P>
<P>
   Cook's first save of the season came in Bruce Benedict's second
game _ and second victory _ as substitute manager for Bobby
Valentine, who sat out the second part of his two-game suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter allowed 1 run and 3 singles in 7 innings before 37,601
fans at Busch Stadium, and appeared to be on his way to victory as
Mark McGwire went hitless in 4 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   On a night when the Mets got three hits apiece from Robin
Ventura, including a two-run homer, and Rey Ordonez, and Mike
Piazza had two hits to extend his hitting streak to a career-high
20 games, Leiter struck out 8 and walked just 1. He lowered his
earned run average to 5.20. Three starts ago, it was 6.39.
</P>
<P>
   Since Leiter defeated the Yankees, 7-2, on June 6 to snap the
Mets' eight-game losing streak, the Mets (36-30) have won 9 of 11
games. During that stretch, their starters, so woeful that they
cost pitching coach Bob Apodaca his job, are 8-0 with a 3.01 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter has unquestionably led the way. His last three starts
have been brilliant: 4 runs in 21 innings, 3 wins, a 1.71 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the Cardinals' second, when Leiter allowed all three
singles, the 33-year-old left-hander was near perfect. The only
other base-runner Leiter permitted was Joe McEwing, who walked
leading off the sixth. He was quickly erased when Edgar Renteria
bounced into a double play on which he broke his bat.
</P>
<P>
   Leiter finished his night's work with a flourish, striking out
the side in the seventh on 11 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mets still had to sweat this one out. Just before Franco
allowed the two-run single to Tatis in the ninth, McGwire hit a
comebacker with runners on second and third to Franco, who threw
the ball to third base - only to have umpire Ed Rapuano rule that
McEwing had dived back safely.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Mets hung on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to at least somewhere in the last few years of my
career be on a winner,'' McGwire said before the game. He went to
three World Series in a row with Oakland from 1988-90, but has not
been to the postseason since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least get the taste of it again,'' McGwire said. ``It's
been quite a few years.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Cardinals again have an injury-depleted pitching staff,
they have dropped 6 of their last 9 games, are 12-17 at home, and
they might even see manager Tony LaRussa walk away from the
organization after this year.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, who has 19 home runs, said he is happy this season that
the media has pretty much left him alone. The man who shattered one
of baseball's cherished records by hitting 70 last season said
whoever broke his mark would be under worse pressure than he was.
</P>
<P>
   I'd feel for the person in that position,'' he said. ``It would
be a thousand times worse than what I went through. The media
pressure would be a thousand times greater.''
</P>
<P>
   When McGwire was asked if he thought he could ever top himself,
he said:
</P>

   ``Realistically, what happened last year, you can't expect it
again. If people expect that, you don't live in the real world.
Nobody ever talks about how there have only been 18 people who have
ever hit 50 or 60 in history. A lot of people don't live in the
real world, I guess.''

GONZALEZ, SELE LEAD RANGERS PAST YANKEES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The sixth-inning, game-tying home run by Texas
Rangers right fielder Juan Gonzalez traveled 370 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The seventh-inning single by left fielder Roberto Kelly barely
escaped the dirt in front of the plate.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the long and short of the Rangers' 4-2 victory
Thursday night against the New York Yankees and five-time Cy Young
Award winner Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly's two-out, swinging-bunt single off Clemens (6-2) scored
catcher Gregg Zaun from third base with what proved to be the
winning run. It also made a winner of right-hander Aaron Sele, who
beat Clemens despite the latter's season-high 13 strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Sele (7-5) surrendered two runs on six hits despite five walks,
and the Rangers escaped Yankee Stadium with a split of this
four-game series and a two-game winning streak without seven-time
All-Star catcher Ivan Rodriguez and left fielder Rusty Greer in the
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, the two wins are exciting,'' manager Johnny Oates
said after the Rangers beat the Yankees for the sixth time in their
past 20 regular-season encounters. ``But the thing that's exciting
to me is the way those two guys pitched the past two nights.''
</P>
<P>
   The pitching performances by Sele and Rick Helling _ who started
and won Wednesday night _ gave the Rangers the opportunity to win,
and the Rangers took advantage of breaks that always seem to go
against them when playing the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers turned a second-inning triple play and an
eighth-inning double play on line drives by Yankees designated
hitter Chili Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the two balls Chili hit,'' Oates said. ``We got five
outs on those two balls. Then look at Roberto's single. Now, we're
not going to throw it back. There have been some things here that
have went against us. Things went our way tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens appeared annoyed at plate umpire Eric Cooper on the
pitch before Kelly's game-winning single. Clemens attempted to sell
the two-strike pitch as the third strike by walking toward the
Yankees' first-base dugout, but it did not pass through Cooper's
strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens muttered while pacing around the mound after the pitch,
and Kelly chopped the next delivery into the dirt surrounding the
plate. Catcher Jorge Posada went to field the ball, but a momentary
slip on the grass _ wet from a steady rain _ gave him no chance to
retire Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   Zaun, who led off the inning with one of four infield singles
against Clemens, scored after being advanced with a sacrifice bunt
and a ground ball.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared early to be a hopeless night against Clemens, who
retired 11 of the first 17 batters on swinging strikes before
shortstop Royce Clayton lined a one-out, fifth-inning double into
right field and scored on a game-tying single by second baseman
Mark McLemore.
</P>
<P>
   Sele, though, battled and refused to give in despite issuing
consecutive third-inning walks to shortstop Derek Jeter and center
fielder Bernie Williams. The latter scored Posada with the Yankees'
first run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew Roger was on,'' Sele said. ``He looked sharp, and I
knew it was going to be a battle. One base hit could have meant two
or three runs, and we couldn't afford that.'' nn

NEW YORK STATE SENATE APPROVES BILL PROTECTING ABORTION CLINIC
ACCESS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By   RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, New York _ The state Senate approved a bill Thursday
night making it a crime to block access to abortion clinics.
</P>
<P>
   And another law long sought by liberals, punishing hate crimes,
including crimes against homosexuals, moved closer to reality after
Roman Catholic Church leaders indicated Thursday that they would
consider supporting such a measure.
</P>
<P>
   The chances of either measure's passage remain unclear, despite
the passage of the abortion clinic bill by a 56-4 vote. The
versions of the bills in the Republican-controlled Senate face
uncertain futures in the Democrat-controlled Assembly, which has
passed stronger versions of both.
</P>
<P>
   And even if church leaders come out in favor of a hate crimes
bill, that would not guarantee Senate passage, because many
Republican senators genuinely oppose the idea, but it would improve
the bill's chances.
</P>
<P>
   But the apparent movement was hailed by supporters of both
changes as a sign that the Senate Republicans, especially their
majority leader, Joseph Bruno, were loosening their longstanding
conservatism on many social issues. Sen. Roy Goodman, a Manhattan
Republican who has long favored laws on clinic access and hate
crimes, said, ``I think there's really been a sea change on these
matters on which the Senate has tended to be to the right of public
opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Both houses of the Legislature met Thursday _ a day after the
scheduled end of their 1999 session _ in a harried bid to close
most of their business for the year. But at day's end, negotiations
were still under way on dozens of issues, and there were no talks
on a state budget because Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver spent
most of the day in New York City at political events with Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Several prominent Republican officials said that Cardinal John
O'Connor, the archbishop of New York, appeared to be laying the
groundwork for the Church hierarchy to support a hate crimes law
that would provide harsher penalties for certain crimes, like
assault or graffiti, when they are motivated by hatred of a
particular group, like blacks, Jews, Catholics or homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   The cardinal's office referred calls to John M. Kerry, executive
director of the New York State Catholic Conference, who insisted
that the cardinal remained neutral on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry confirmed that the cardinal planned to raise the hate
crimes bill at the September meeting of the Catholic Conference,
the group of New York's 26 Catholic bishops, and ask them whether
they wanted to take a position on it. The group last considered the
issue eight years ago, when it decided to take no position.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cardinal has indicated that he would be open to
consideration of legislation,'' Kerry said. ``The Catholic bishops
are very concerned about bias and violence in any form.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
said that while the cardinal has been careful not to say that he
favors the measure, they understood him to be giving it his tacit
support, or at least to be giving the bishops the green light to
back it.
</P>
<P>
   A 1994 federal law provides criminal penalties for people who
block access to abortion clinics, but federal law enforcement
officials say they do not have the resources to enforce it
aggressively. A state law could be enforced by local police and
sheriffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly has passed a clinic access law several times, but
Bruno, until Thursday, had refused to allow one to come to a vote
in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The bill the Senate approved Thursday differs from the Assembly
bill in two important ways: it adds penalties the Senate
Republicans have sought for the crime of stalking, and it does not
contain the Assembly version's provision to allow individuals to
sue anti-abortion protesters for damages for blocking clinics.
Assembly Democrats say they would probably accept the stalking
penalties, but they want to keep the lawsuit provisions.

STARS ONE WIN AWAY AFTER GAME 5 TRIUMPH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Call it a manicurist's nightmare _ and the NHL's dream.
</P>
<P>
   Fingernails have been an endangered species in the Stanley Cup
Finals, and last night's Game 5 proved that cuticles could be next.
After four consecutive sweeps in the Finals the previous four
seasons, high-tension hockey is finally at its most intense in the
battle for sport's oldest trophy.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars survived a beautifully physical, stunningly
suspenseful 2-0 victory against the Buffalo Sabres before a
win-thirsty crowd of 17,001 at Reunion Arena to grab a 3-2 lead in
the best-of-seven series and are now one victory from winning the
Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the first period was the best anybody played against
us all year in our building. The second period was the best that we
have played in a long time in the playoffs,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said. ``And then the third period was just war.''
</P>
<P>
   The game had everything. Great defense, great goaltending,
high-skilled scoring plays and plenty of pushing, shoving and
hitting. With both sides exchanging punches and verbal barbs
walking off the ice, it showed just how close these two teams are
heading into Game 6 tomorrow in Buffalo, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a feel for anything right now,'' Hitchcock said.
``The emotional swings in these games are so dramatic. I just think
this thing is up for grabs until the end.''
</P>
<P>
   With last night's victory, the Stars now have a cushion, a
margin of error that has been critical in this series. They lost it
in a crucial Game 4 defeat, but they gained it back last night by
being nearly flawless.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever mistakes they made, Stars goalie Ed Belfour cleaned up
as he picked up his seventh career playoff shutout, the third of
this playoff campaign. What's more, he tied the NHL record for
allowing opponents one or fewer goals in nine playoff games in the
same season.
</P>
<P>
   Sabres goalie Dominik Hasek was almost as good as Belfour, but
he simply was beat by fantastic shots. Hasek was tagged by Darryl
Sydor on a second period power play and by Pat Verbeek on a
breakaway with 4:39 remaining in the game. Otherwise, he held up
well.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Stars showed in this game that they were the ones
who were going to make the big plays and each goal contained three
outstanding points for each player.
</P>
<P>
   Goal 1 started with Stars defenseman Sergei Zubov moving the
puck out of his own end on the power play. Zubov drew Sabres
captain Michael Peca deep into the corner and then found Stars
center Mike Modano skating out of the defensive zone and gathering
speed. With Zubov's pass on his stick, Modano was able to fly into
the offensive zone and disorient the Sabres' penalty killer,
particularly Peca, who trailed far behind.
</P>
<P>
   Modano drew all the attention to the right side of the offensive
zone and then found Sydor sneaking in from his left point. Sydor
lifted a perfect wrist shot over Hasek and the Stars had the lead
they needed at 2:23 of the second period.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the norm, we're used to one-goal hockey,'' Hitchcock
said before the game. ``If there was a two-goal lead, we won't
probably know what to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars worked hard to find out as they limited the Sabres'
scoring chances, got strong play from all four lines and all six
defensemen and carried their one-goal lead into the third period.
There, the Sabres cheated up their defensemen one time too many.
</P>
<P>
   Modano made the key play on Goal No. 2 as he outworked Sabres
defenseman Alexei Zhitnik deep in the defensive zone and kicked
free a puck into the neutral zone. There, Stars defenseman Richard
Matvichuk swooped in to pick it up, carried it into the offensive
zone and fed a cross-ice pass to Verbeek.
</P>
<P>
   The right-handed Verbeek then faked Hasek with a forehand shot
and went to the backhand to tuck in his third goal of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Stars have an appointment to win the Stanley Cup. They
can take it tomorrow night.

HITCHCOCK DIALS MODANO'S NUMBER AND THE STAR ANSWERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ For the entire game I was convinced that Mike Modano,
the whirling dervish wearing No. 9 for your Dallas Stars at Reunion
arena Thursday night, must be a faithful ``Star-Telegram''
subscriber.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe he is.
</P>
<P>
   Modano, however, quickly put to rest any notion that he spent
much time reading the newspapers yesterday. Instead, he spent the
day replaying the call that came from his head coach Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Hitchcock's message could be boiled down to this:
</P>
<P>
   Don't be afraid to reach out and touch someone yourself.
</P>
<P>
   The bruised and battered Buffalo Sabres can attest to how well
Modano listens.
</P>
<P>
   Modano, the man Hitchcock said Wednesday had to play better for
the Stars to have a chance to win this series, was easily the best
player on the ice Thursday night, leading the Stars to a 2-0
victory and a 3-games-to-2 lead in the Stanley Cup Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and did we mention that he did all this with an injured
wrist?
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night Hitchcock ``actually called me at home and we
talked on the phone for a while,'' Modano said on national TV as
soon as the game ended. ``I know I hadn't done much in the last
couple of games, just hanging around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight the wrist felt better, and I seemed to have better
range of motion. Give some credit to my trainers; they came up with
a new concept and it worked tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   No, Modano didn't snap his goalless streak, which has reached 10
games, but the only thing he didn't do right Thursday night was put
the puck in the net.
</P>
<P>
   This was the Modano the Stars so desperately needed, playing
with a purpose and a fire that simply was missing in Dallas' 2-1
loss in Game 4 in Buffalo. That flame was fed by Hitchcock, once
again pushing the right button at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought when we came into the game that we had an X-factor
and tonight he was the X-factor,'' Hitchcock said of the Stars'
superstar center. ``I thought for us to win, whether he scored a
point or not, Mike had to be a player of significance. He made a
big step in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to throw a 1-2 punch out there with Modano and
(Joe) Nieuwendyk that was effective and he had a big impact in the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   That _ surprise, surprise _ was exactly what Hitch and his star
player chatted about Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really have a good relationship,'' said Hitchcock, who
joked that he really just phoned Modano, ``to say hello to his mom
and dad.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm able to say some things candidly to him that maybe I can't
say to other players. It was a phone call of support and I asked
him to think in some other directions. He took it to heart and
played great tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Those directions obviously included asking Modano to decapitate
any Sabres player that crossed his path Thursday night. Modano, the
guy with the Hollywood smile, playing tough guy? You better believe
it.
</P>
<P>
   He was, as Dave Reid likes to call it, ``hacking and whacking''
with the best of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd wanted to talk to me earlier that day at the rink but I
wasn't in a very approachable mood that morning,'' Modano said,
``So he called me at home in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a lot of chats during the time he's been here and
we've been together.''
</P>
<P>
   Typical of Hitchcock, he was blunt and to the point.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just plain and simple asked me what kind of player I was
going to be tonight. I told him I was going to be involved in every
aspect of the game. I felt I'd gotten away from that in Game 4.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano used his speed to punish the Sabres. He hit and took
hits, slashed and was slashed, even got into a scrum or two in the
heat of the moment. Check out Buffalo center Curtis Brown's jersey.
I'd swear Modano slashed a giant ``M'' right in the center of it,
ala Zorro.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly it was Modano who set up both Stars' goals.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the second period, he took an inspired cross-ice pass
from Sergei Zubov and broke across the Buffalo blue line along the
right boards. Skidding to a stop, he lasered a pass to Darryl
Sydor, alone in the left circle. Sydor's shot appeared to catch
Dominik Hasek in the forearm, above the glove, and caromed high
into the upper right corner of the net for a 1-0 Stars' lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started in our zone with a breakout and Mike has a lot of
speed and he always attracts a lot of people,'' Sydor said.
``That's what happened this time and he gave me a great pass.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano's help in the Stars' second goal, which put the Sabres
away l6:29 into the final period, wasn't as obvious but just as
essential.
</P>
<P>
   He won a faceoff in the Stars' end, battled for the puck, the
slid it out to Richard Matvichuk along the boards on the left.
Matvichuk and Pat Verbeek were off on a two-on-one break .
Matvichuk slipped a pass between Vaclav Varada's legs and Verbeek
did the rest, faking right to get Hasek spread-eagled, then cutting
left to scoop the backhand into the net.
</P>
<P>
   It all started with a phone call from Hitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always has my number,'' Modano said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night you could say the same about Modano and the
Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   One more victory and I say it's free subscriptions all around.

SABRES DON'T EXPECT OFFENSIVE CHANGES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DARRIN SCHEID 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Buffalo Sabres generated little offense, and they
weren't shy about the reasons after last night's 2-0 loss against
the Stars in Game 5 of the Stanley Cup Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a few chances, but their teams played great defense and
their guy made some great saves,'' Sabres defenseman James Patrick
said. ``It's no different than the rest of the series.''
</P>
<P>
   To remedy that in Game 6 and keep the series alive, Buffalo
doesn't plan on changing anything.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo center Erik Rasmussen said last night's loss in Dallas
was typical of the previous five games, and just because the Stars
scored twice doesn't mean Buffalo played poorly.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres fell behind, 1-0, on a power-play goal.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas' final goal came with less than five minutes remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to play the same way,'' Rasmussen said. ``Change?
Change what? It's a one-goal game, and they got one at the end.
We're going to keep doing the same things, and maybe get one in the
goal. A lot of times, it comes down to breaks, and you have to be
on the other end of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Several players from Buffalo said after last night's game that
luck is always a factor in close games like every one in this
series. A lucky deflection of somebody's leg or strange rebound off
the goaltender, or even a wacky bound off the boards can lead to
victory, Sabres winger Dixon Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   Ward also said you need pinpoint shooting like Dallas had in its
first goal. Mike Modano passed to Darryl Sydor, who lifted a shot
in for the second-period lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes the perfect shot sometimes, especially with the way
these teams play defense,'' he said. ``On their goal, Modano made a
great pass and Sydor made an unbelievable shot. He put it the only
place he could have. We can do the same thing, and we have in this
series. We're going to continue working hard and bring the series
back to Dallas. Maybe we'll get a break.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo went quietly through the first two periods last night,
despite throwing 23 shots on goal.
</P>
<P>
   But Belfour offered no place for the puck, and he offered no
rebounds. In the third period, when Buffalo scrambled in front of
the net, Belfour was equally tough.
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo's added pressure in the final minutes led to a Dallas
breakaway, and the Stars made it 2-0 on a goal by Richard
Matvichuk.

LESSON LEARNED, KNOWLEDGE APPLIED LEAVES STARS SO CLOSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Fifteen down. One silvery dream of a victory to go.
</P>
<P>
   After 82 regular-season games, after 114 regular-season points,
after 58 days of Stanley Cup playoffs ... the dream is so close,
they can almost skate with it.
</P>
<P>
   After beating the Buffalo Sabres on Thursday night, 2-0, the
Stars are at the doorstep. They are poised at the gate. Hockey
heaven could be as near as Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   You live and learn, the Stars have insisted. They lived through
the opening-round loss to Edmonton two years ago, and they learned.
They lived through the spanking at the hands of Detroit last
season, and they said they learned.
</P>
<P>
   And they played Game 5 of a series just 19 days ago. They
learned.
</P>
<P>
   On that Sunday afternoon against Colorado, the Stars locked with
the Avalanche in a foolish snowball fight. Twelve goals were
scored, seven by the winning Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars swallowed that decision. They survived. They learned.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game had so many swings of momentum, I don't think
anybody ever had control,'' coach Ken Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Hitch was listening to his heart, which was probably still
pounding.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, his team had begun to dictate the tone of this Game 5
as early as the second period. It was destined to be a defensive
effort on the order of what the Stars had performed in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   After what had happened in the Colorado series and in the first
four games of the Finals, the Stars had announced that any kind of
victory, even a 1-0 one, would surely do.
</P>
<P>
   They nearly had one. The Sabres managed to squeeze out only five
shots in the second period.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first period, we didn't really do anything we set out
to do,'' defenseman Darryl Sydor said. ``But we regrouped during
the first intermission, and we came out and played our game a
little bit better.''
</P>
<P>
   Their game. Stars hockey. The hockey literati might label it
with stronger adjectives.
</P>
<P>
   But the last thing that the Stars wanted was another 7-5 game,
not that the Sabres would ever try to instigate one.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock took exception, however, to the suggestion Thursday
night that his team grabbed a 1-0 lead and then nested over it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing we had control was the score,'' Hitch argued. ``But
we spent some time in our end because of the way Buffalo plays. We
had to just hang in there and hope the cracks were there.''
</P>
<P>
   The cracks were few, but they did come. Mike Modano's effort
along the boards, kicking the puck out of his own zone, keyed the
two-on-one break that led to Pat Verbeek's goal, making it 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   And on this night, there didn't seem to be any way that the
Stars were going to surrender a two-goal lead, especially in the
final five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the first period was the best that any team has
played in our building all year,'' Hitchcock said, acknowledging
the Sabres' effort. ``And I thought the second period was the best
we've played in the playoffs in a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then the third period was just an absolute war.''
</P>
<P>
   In hockey parlance, it was a night for grinders. In the stands,
it was a night for fingernail chewers.
</P>
<P>
   It was shift-by-shift hockey. And when Verbeek, Darryl Sydor,
Derian Hatcher and Richard Matvichuk are at the frequent center of
the action, the Stars are usually playing their game. Even with a
furious Buffalo push at the end, shots for the visitors were
difficult to come by.
</P>
<P>
   And once again, what did slip through the defense, goaltender Ed
Belfour was there to halt.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't pretty, but the Stars learned. The past has taught
them that an opportunity in Game 5 should never be squandered _ not
in this series, especially. The two foes are simply too close.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a feel for anything right now,'' Hitchcock said,
``because the swings of momentum happen so quickly with these two
teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, except for us being up three games to two, that
any team can feel comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, after eight months of hockey, after 58 days of playoffs,
the end is so close, the Stars can feel it.
</P>
<P>
   It is shiny and silver. It is the stuff of dreams.
</P>
<P>
   And there's just one more memorable night to go.

SYDOR, VERBEEK GIVE STARS A SPARK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAULA CABALLERO 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Remember when Stars coach Ken Hitchcock was thinking of
moving defenseman Darryl Sydor to forward?
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock was going to pair Sydor with Mike Modano and Jere
Lehtinen on the Stars' top line.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't. And he didn't have to. Sydor scored off a Modano pass
for the game-winning goal.
</P>
<P>
   Remember little scrapper Pat Verbeek? Hitchcock moved him to
Modano's line last night. He scored on an odd-man rush with Richard
Matvichuk, on a play set up by _ surprise _ Modano.
</P>
<P>
   Modano needed finishers. Last night, he found them.
</P>
<P>
   Unlikely heroes? Maybe. Neither had a point in this series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I haven't really done much offensively,'' Sydor said.
</P>
<P>
   But Sydor and Verbeek are hardly incapable. Sydor has two goals
and 11 points in the playoffs, and Verbeek has two goals and six
points.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps these two were simply due.
</P>
<P>
   And elated to make a difference on the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight, to play in this game in front of our fans with the
intensity both teams throw out on the ice, it's great to be an
athlete,'' Verbeek said. ``It's great to be a hockey player and I'm
really enjoying myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Now don't think Mike Modano's input last night has been
overlooked. He knew he had to step up. But sometimes when great
players step up, they press, trying to score.
</P>
<P>
   Modano shined by lifting those around him, by making them the
heroes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him \RHitchcock\S I was going to be a player involved
in every aspect of the game,'' Modano said.
</P>
<P>
   The result of the multihero night was a multigoal victory in a
big-time game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team all year has been a team where somebody different
steps up, we don't rely on one guy,'' Sydor said. ``We all know
what's at the end of the tunnel. We all have to sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows who the next hero will be?''

`OTHER GOALIE' BELFOUR TAKES BOWS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Dominik Hasek is the goalie with the Olympic gold
medal, the two Hart Trophies for being the league MVP, the four
Vezina Trophies for being the NHL's best between the pipes, the
well-earned reputation as the best on the planet and, if the
commercial is to be believed, the slinky for a spine.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Belfour is the goalie with the only shutout in the Stanley
Cup Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour's team is the one with the 3-2 lead in the series, and
the one that's one victory away from winning hockey's big prize.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars beat the Sabres, 2-0, Thursday night at Reunion Arena
because their goalie, with a huge assist from his defense, pitched
a shutout.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played great,'' Stars defenseman and captain Derian Hatcher
said. ``He kept us in the game. You could say he won the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but he wouldn't have done it without a defense that
atoned for two huge gaffes in Game 4 in Buffalo. The Stars lost
that one because mistakes by Shawn Chambers and Craig Ludwig handed
the Sabres two gift-wrapped goals.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, the defense made sure Belfour faced a minimum of
shots.
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher and Richard Matvichuk, his defensive partner, combined
to dish out 11 hits and block eight shots.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers, the goat on the first goal on Tuesday, played 25
shifts and blocked a team-high five shots. Ludwig, Darryl Sydor and
Sergei Zubov were solid.
</P>
<P>
   The defense also provided most of the offense. Sydor scored the
first goal on a power play early in the second period, and
Matvichuk started a rush and passed to Pat Verbeek for the clincher
late in the third.
</P>
<P>
   But to repeat Hatcher, you could say Belfour won this one.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour, who posted his third shutout this postseason and
allowed less than two goals for the ninth time, faced 23 shots.
Nine of them came in the final period, but that's not indicative of
the pressure he faced. The Sabres were pressing hard to get the
equalizer, and constantly had players flying at the goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both goaltenders are really under siege,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said. ``The shot totals are not indicative of the
tenacity in front of the net.''
</P>
<P>
   In the third period, Belfour stopped a changeup of a shot by
Alexi Zhitnik by squeezing it between his pads. He snapped out the
glove to snag a Zhitnik shot. He used his stick, his blocker and
his body to stop the puck.
</P>
<P>
   He made tough saves that brought gasps, then cheers, then chants
of ``Eddie, Eddie'' from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   He made saves that weren't so obvious, but difficult
nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie made two good saves in the third period, one on a
deflection and one on a cross-ice pass,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   The goalie with the reputation for being a hothead remained cool
in the third period when a desperate Sabres team, knowing they
might be playing for their Stanley Cup lives, buzzed all around
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie played very well again,'' Stars forward Mike Keane said.
``We needed great goal-tending, and Eddie supplied us with that.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive series, Belfour is the ``other
goalie.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Western Conference semifinals, the glamour net-minder was
Patrick Roy. In this one, it was Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really care,'' Belfour said. ``That's the way it goes
sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, his teammates can see the determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie's been playing unbelievably for us,'' Sydor said. ``He's
been in the shadow of a lot of goaltenders, and I think he's taken
that as motivation.''

GET READY FOR A NEW HOCKEYTOWN - DALLAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS - Here in the land of strip malls and strip clubs, where
a sign outside Reunion Arena warns customers to leave their
firearms at home, lies a terrible truth:
</P>
<P>
   Texas is poised to become king of hockey.
</P>
<P>
   It is a little-known fact, but when you count minor-league
organizations, Texas has more professional hockey teams (13) than
Canada (12).
</P>
<P>
   And the dreaded Dallas Stars are 60 minutes away from its first
Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't done anything yet,'' the Stars' Darryl Sydor said.
</P>
<P>
   True, and wouldn't it be nice to pull the plug on Buffalo's
misery, to end the longest running gag in professional sports? To
solidify the self-esteem of a locale famous only for chicken wings
and Super Bowl futility? Yes, the Sabres are resilient, and if
anyone is capable of winning two games by himself, it's Dominik
Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   But it's starting to smell like armadillos and quesadillas.
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret that the Stars fit the villain's cloak with ease,
and whattayaknow, Derian Hatcher may have seriously injured yet
another player in a post-game scrum with Buffalo's Rhett Warrener.
Right after Stars Coach Ken Hitchcock initiated a shouting match
with Sabres Coach Lindy Ruff.
</P>
<P>
   But as much as it hurts, it's time to give credit where it's
due.
</P>
<P>
   In a frenzy to pass the pace horse, the Red Wings and the
Avalanche both executed blockbuster deals at the deadline, but it's
the Stars who are still skating. And still winning, even without a
healthy room.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, with Brett Hull and Benoit Hogue
questionable for Game 5, Hitchcock called Mike Modano at home.
Modano has an injured wrist, can barely shoot a puck, and was
slipping into the realm of non-factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just asked me, plain and simple, what kind of hockey player
I was going to be tonight,'' Modano said. ``I told him I was going
to be a player involved in every aspect of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   He kept his word, flying all over the ice, winning face-offs,
setting up Darryl Sydor on a gorgeous goal, the only one the Stars
would need.
</P>
<P>
   Sydor also has close ties to Hitchcock. When Sydor was 13,
Hitchcock recruited him for his junior team. When Sydor was 16 and
homesick, Hitchcock occasionally found Sydor at the Greyhound
station.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe it or not, at age 14, he weighed 20 or 30 pounds more
than he does now,'' said Hitchcock, who has shed much blubber
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Yet no one is primed for redemption quite like the goalie, Eddie
Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   It is a little-known fact, but Belfour once received a speeding
ticket in Chicago and drove away while the officer was in his
patrol car filling out the citation. Belfour pled ignorance,
claiming he didn't know he had to stick around.
</P>
<P>
   It is common knowledge, however, that Belfour was once a
hot-head prone to volcanic eruptions. These days, he's the picture
of calm and focus, ready to claim the big prize.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a fascinating series, the puck equivalent of a
pitcher's duel, and the competitive balance has been striking. In
this decade, only two Stanley Cup Finals have reached six games.
But this more than just duration.
</P>
<P>
   Until Pat Verbeek's clinching backhand on Thursday, Buffalo and
Dallas had played 310 minutes and 51 seconds of hockey with a
one-goal differential or less. The only blip amounted to 26
seconds, an empty-net goal in Game 2 that gave the Stars a 4-2
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is just no read on momentum,'' Hitchcock said. ``It's an
absolute shift-by-shift battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Hockey in a pressure chamber, which has led to an amazing amount
of animosity between two teams with very little history and two
states wrestling in a rare spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Dallas Morning News'' contacted a mathematician,
requesting the odds of two teams from Texas battling two teams from
New York for both the NBA and NHL title.
</P>
<P>
   Try 1-in-4,250.
</P>
<P>
   After a tenacious victory on Thursday, the odds of Texas
prevailing in both have improved dramatically. And the bragging
rights will only continue.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, Nolan Ryan - the great icon of Texas, the man who
epitomized the Don't-Mess-With-Us mentality - will enter the Hall
of Fame. In New York.
</P>

BURKE: TOCCHET SHOULD SHUT UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Coyotes owner Richard Burke issued a stinging rebuke
Thursday to veteran forward Rick Tocchet's published comments
questioning his future in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of two things. It's either agent B.S., or it's Rick
being part of the problem and not part of the solution,'' Burke
said from Denver, where he was studying the construction of the
Pepsi Center.
</P>
<P>
   Burke criticized Tocchet for the timing and tone of remarks in
Dan Bickley's column on Saturday in ``The Arizona Republic''.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety percent of the time, Rick's part of the solution. But
10 percent of the time, he's part of the problem,'' Burke said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not good timing. It's the right time to keep his mouth
shut. Sit on your hands and your mouth, Rick.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes hold the option to bring back the 400-goal scorer
for one more season at the same $2.15 million he earned last year,
but they have shown no interest in signing him beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   Burke added, however, that he fully appreciates the ``90 percent
of the solution'' part of Tocchet and isn't trying to sound overly
negative because ``We've got some guys who are 50-50, and Rick's a
90-10. I didn't have good sense when I was his age either, and
sometimes, I still don't.''
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Bobby Smith is expected to exercise the options
on Tocchet and veteran left wing Greg Adams, but the team wasn't
happy with the 35-year-old Tocchet's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't understand what they're doing,'' Tocchet told
Bickley. ``They have to go one direction or another. If they're
struggling, why don't they just let me go, not bring back Greg
Adams, and trade (Jeremy Roenick) for a bunch of prospects? I don't
want to hear that they're losing $5 million to 6 million a year.
You know what? Then gut the team, call it a business decision and
wait until you get your stadium to go after the Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Tocchet declined comment Thursday, but his agent, Steve Mountain
of Philadelphia, responded to Burke's comments and questions about
his client's future in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why someone would say that. We're not trying to
manipulate anything here,'' Mountain said. ``Rick's entitled to his
opinion, though, when a writer calls and asks what the team is
going to do about his option year and he says, `I don't know what
they're going to do, go ask them.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, we understand the rules, and neither Rick nor I has made
any or had any conversations with the Coyotes organization since
last year. And I have specifically shut down writers' requests to
discuss Rick's contractual relationship publicly. The bottom line
is Rick loves Phoenix and he wants to keep playing there.''
</P>
<P>
   Without an extension, Tocchet could be moved at the March
trading deadline. If the strained relationship with the club
continues, it's also possible he will be traded this summer, to
which Mountain said, ``That would be disappointing because Rick
doesn't want to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tocchet situation isn't the only immediate matter Smith must
face. He also is preparing for next week's NHL expansion draft and
entry draft, searching with new Coach Bobby Francis for two new
assistant coaches, and trying to plan a budget to fit the team's
payroll. In addition, Smith needs to address at least a dozen
player contract issues by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Coyotes may be faced with possible holdouts by two of
their top-echelon players. Goalie Nikolai Khabibulin and
second-line center Robert Reichel are seeking lucrative new deals,
and negotiations regarding both likely could last the entire summer
and beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Reichel and Khabibulin are set to become Group II restricted
free agents on July 1 and could be headed to lengthy stalemates
with Smith over salary.
</P>
<P>
   Reichel's agent, Paul Kraus, already has rejected the club's
initial offer, believed to be about $2.2 million a season. Reichel
wants a salary of about $3.5 million and is threatening to leave
the NHL altogether to play in his native Czech Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes hold exclusive rights over restricted free agents
but must tender offers that include a minimum 10 percent increase
in pay. Other NHL teams can sign the players to offer sheets, but
then face forfeiting a series of draft picks as compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Burke have indicated that star players Keith Tkachuk
and Jeremy Roenick will be back next season and won't be dealt in
cost-cutting maneuvers. The team likely will try to add a few
players for depth through free agency or trades, but will not make
a pitch for a ``core-type'' player, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The team has several potential free agents, including defensemen
Oleg Tverdovsky, Stan Necker, Gerald Diduck and Jamie Huscroft, and
forwards Shane Doan, Tavis Hansen, Jim Cummins, Mike Sullivan and
Bob Corkum. &QL;

Sabres face new problem 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Buffalo Sabres players have defeated a No. 2 seed,
played without game-stealing goalie Dominik Hasek and survived when
40-goal scorer Miroslav Satan suffered an ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Sabres players have encountered and overcome just about
every possible adversity in this Stanley Cup journey, except one.
</P>
<P>
   They have yet to stare down the face of elimination. Until now.
</P>
<P>
   A 2-0 Stars victory in Game 5 last night at Reunion Arena has
brought the Sabres face-to-face with that challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres find themselves trailing 3-2 in this Stanley Cup
Finals series and in need of a victory in Game 6 to keep alive
their chance to bring a Stanley Cup championship to Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know what your psyche will be until you get in that
situation,'' Sabres defenseman James Patrick said. ``The game will
be won or lost on the ice. ... Obviously, there is no tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Big games call for big cliches, and Sabres players used just
about all of them in the postgame locker room when the subject
turned to Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   They will play desperate hockey, forward Curtis Brown assured.
</P>
<P>
   They were a couple of breaks away from winning Game 5, Patrick
said.
</P>
<P>
   They're a confident team, winger Dixon Ward insisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely, we expect to win,'' Ward said. ``I'm not going to
guarantee anything, but we're going out there with the idea to win
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Sabres coach Lindy Ruff: ``We're a confident team in our
own building, and we believe we'll be back here for Game 7.''
</P>
<P>
   Buffalo has a 8-1 mark at Marine Midland Arena so far this
playoffs. Their only loss? The Stars stunned the Sabres with a 2-1
victory in Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   Sabres players say while Game 4 didn't officially count as an
elimination game, it was close enough for them to say they have
experience in that type of situation.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres were trailing 2-1 in the series at that point. They
had just been soundly defeated in Game 3 at home. They looked
tired. They looked beaten. They looked done.
</P>
<P>
   They, instead, responded by playing maybe their best game of the
series and came away with a 2-1, series-tying victory over the
Stars as a result.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have any room for error last time we headed home,
either,'' Ward said. ``... No we haven't faced elimination before,
but really we have.''
</P>
<P>
   To a man, Sabres players insisted that adversity is all the same
whether its winning without Hasek or facing an elimination game.
Patrick's words had a certain resonance, though, because saying and
doing are two totally different things.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres know they have to win, say they can, but don't
actually have any experience in winning games like these.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know the situation we're in. You guys don't have to tell
us,'' Ward said. ``We're smart enough to count to seven. The first
team there wins.''
</P>
<P>
   The math is simple. The Sabres are only a single loss away from
the end of their season. The psychology is a little bit harder.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody, not even the Sabres, knows how they are going to
respond.

FOREMAN-TYSON BOUT DRAWS INTEREST

<P>
   PHOENIX - George Foreman and Mike Tyson are boxing's old man and
the parolee. As a fight, they have been the biggest fish tale in a
sport full of whoppers.
</P>
<P>
   But fantasy might becoming fact because of a financial offer
that is expected to be pitched to Tyson this weekend in the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Weathers, a former Foreman promoter and adviser, plans to
travel here as early as today with a $25 million offer for Tyson to
fight Foreman, 50, later this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike Tyson will do the right thing, which is to take the
money,'' said Weathers, who will negotiate on behalf of Fred Levin,
a wealthy Florida attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Levin, attorney for light-heavyweight champion Roy Jones, Jr.,
got a $325 million fee for a lawsuit that netted the state of
Florida $11 billion from the tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   Weathers, who is hoping to arrange a face-to-face meeting with
Tyson to pitch the offer, is carrying a letter signed by Levin
that, in part, reads: ``I am prepared to pay $25,000,000.00 cash to
Mike Tyson for Mike to fight George Foreman.''
</P>
<P>
   Weathers also is carrying a letter addressed to Tyson that urges
him to take the fight. Tyson will turn 33 on June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Levin confirmed Thursday from his Pensacola, Fla., office that
he is attempting to put together the heavyweight bout.
</P>
<P>
   He said Weathers will represent him in any meeting he might have
with Tyson, who returned to the Valley early this week after 3{
months in a Maryland jail on misdemeanor assault charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been trying to do this for a couple of weeks now,'' Levin
said. ``But it's been hard to talk to all the different people
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Weathers is bringing the proposal to Phoenix for a
personal presentation to Tyson, who plans to resume training at the
former Madison Square Garden, a central Phoenix gym where he worked
out before a victory over Francois Botha on Jan. 16.
</P>
<P>
   But Tyson adviser Shelley Finkel said a bout between the two
former heavyweight champions remains farfetched because he said
neither Weathers nor Levin could get an agreement with Foreman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've asked George to call me, and he hasn't,'' Finkel said
from his New York office. ``That's it. I don't believe there's any
chance until I talk to someone. I don't know of Ron Weathers going
out there. I don't know about Mike seeing him or talking to him.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Foreman-Tyson possibility surfaced a couple of weeks
ago in the ``New York Daily News,'' there were subsequent reports
that the bout wouldn't happen because Top Rank promoter Bob Arum
continues to hold rights to Foreman.
</P>
<P>
   Arum promoted the 1994 bout in which Foreman, then 45, became
history's oldest heavyweight champion with a knockout of Michael
Moorer. Arum also promoted Foreman's controversial decision over
German Axel Schulz in a subsequent defense of the World Boxing
Association title.
</P>
<P>
   Finkel said Weathers and Levin could not put together the fight
as independent promoters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not if they can't deliver the fighter (Foreman),'' Finkel
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Weathers said there was enough money to include all the
parties with a potential interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd include him,'' Weathers said of Arum, who would have to
share with Dan Goosen of America Presents, which also has
promotional rights to Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Levin said he would offer a minimum of $15 million to Foreman,
who is expected to return to the United States this weekend from
Australia. According to Bill Caplan, a longtime friend of and
adviser to Foreman, the fighter still is interested in a Tyson
bout, which was his goal when he launched his improbable comeback
in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to see George fight anyone, with the exception of
Tyson, which I would love to see,'' Caplan said. ``I would also
love to see Fred Levin promote the fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Levin said he would not want Tyson to fight a tuneup, which has
been speculated, because a shaky performance by Tyson would lessen
interest. Tyson looked very beatable through four rounds before he
knocked out Botha in the fifth, trailing on the judges' cards.
</P>
<P>
   There is speculation that Finkel is close to getting an
agreement from Schulz to fight Tyson in September.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mike fought a tuneup and looked bad, it would be tough to
sell a fight with Foreman,'' Levin said. ``If Tyson lost, it would
end it. I think the time for them is now. It could be one of the
great ones of all time.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Dominik Hasek is the goalie with the Olympic gold
medal, the two Hart Trophies for being the league MVP, the four
Vezina Trophies for being the NHL's best between the pipes, the
well-earned reputation as the best on the planet and, if the
commercial is to be believed, the slinky for a spine.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Belfour is the goalie with the only shutout in the Stanley
Cup Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour's team is the one with the 3-2 lead in the series, and
the one that's one victory away from winning hockey's big prize.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars beat the Sabres, 2-0, Thursday night at Reunion Arena
because their goalie, with a huge assist from his defense, pitched
a shutout.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played great,'' Stars defenseman and captain Derian Hatcher
said. ``He kept us in the game. You could say he won the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but he wouldn't have done it without a defense that
atoned for two huge gaffes in Game 4 in Buffalo. The Stars lost
that one because mistakes by Shawn Chambers and Craig Ludwig handed
the Sabres two gift-wrapped goals.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, the defense made sure Belfour faced a minimum of
shots.
</P>
<P>
   Hatcher and Richard Matvichuk, his defensive partner, combined
to dish out 11 hits and block eight shots.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers, the goat on the first goal on Tuesday, played 25
shifts and blocked a team-high five shots. Ludwig, Darryl Sydor and
Sergei Zubov were solid.
</P>
<P>
   The defense also provided most of the offense. Sydor scored the
first goal on a power play early in the second period, and
Matvichuk started a rush and passed to Pat Verbeek for the clincher
late in the third.
</P>
<P>
   But to repeat Hatcher, you could say Belfour won this one.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour, who posted his third shutout this postseason and
allowed less than two goals for the ninth time, faced 23 shots.
Nine of them came in the final period, but that's not indicative of
the pressure he faced. The Sabres were pressing hard to get the
equalizer, and constantly had players flying at the goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both goaltenders are really under siege,'' Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock said. ``The shot totals are not indicative of the
tenacity in front of the net.''
</P>
<P>
   In the third period, Belfour stopped a changeup of a shot by
Alexi Zhitnik by squeezing it between his pads. He snapped out the
glove to snag a Zhitnik shot. He used his stick, his blocker and
his body to stop the puck.
</P>
<P>
   He made tough saves that brought gasps, then cheers, then chants
of ``Eddie, Eddie'' from the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   He made saves that weren't so obvious, but difficult
nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie made two good saves in the third period, one on a
deflection and one on a cross-ice pass,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   The goalie with the reputation for being a hothead remained cool
in the third period when a desperate Sabres team, knowing they
might be playing for their Stanley Cup lives, buzzed all around
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie played very well again,'' Stars forward Mike Keane said.
``We needed great goal-tending, and Eddie supplied us with that.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive series, Belfour is the ``other
goalie.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Western Conference semifinals, the glamour net-minder was
Patrick Roy. In this one, it was Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really care,'' Belfour said. ``That's the way it goes
sometimes.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, his teammates can see the determination.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie's been playing unbelievably for us,'' Sydor said. ``He's
been in the shadow of a lot of goaltenders, and I think he's taken
that as motivation.''

EDITORIAL: HINTS OF A MILD FED ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, June 18:
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board,
signaled Thursday that the Fed would take only the tiniest of steps
to push up interest rates when its Open Market Committee meets at
the end of this month. That is likely to have only a mild impact on
the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan, in congressional testimony, referred to ``modest
pre-emptive action'' to head off inflation, which probably means
that the Fed will raise the federal funds rate _ the rate at which
banks borrow from one another _ by only a quarter of a percentage
point. That would reverse just one of the three cuts made last year
when the Fed was worried about world recession.
</P>
<P>
   The economy appears to be growing at a rate of about 4 percent a
year, a rate Greenspan believes is unsustainable without bringing
on unacceptable inflation. He wants to slow that to about 3
percent, which would still be a healthy rate.
</P>
<P>
   As Greenspan noted, the current expansion, which began in 1991,
will be the longest in American history if it extends through next
February. Credit for that excellent performance is widely shared.
Fiscal and monetary policy have been generally good, but they would
not have been enough without the burst of productivity brought on
by technological advances or without international events that have
helped to make the United States an attractive place for investment
while also restraining inflationary forces.
</P>
<P>
   Such a favorable economic environment, as Greenspan noted, ``can
induce investors to take on more risk and drive asset prices to
unsustainable levels.'' He is clearly worried that stock prices may
be too high, but is not inclined to second-guess ``hundreds of
thousands of informed investors.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he is confident that the Fed can limit the economic
damage if there is a crash. ``While bubbles that burst are scarcely
benign, the consequences need not be catastrophic for the
economy,'' he said. That sounds markedly different from the old
Greenspan, who 30 months ago warned investors against ``irrational
exuberance'' and urged central bankers not to underestimate ``the
complexity of the interactions of asset markets and the economy.''
The new Greenspan is brimming with self-assurance. Let us hope the
market does not test his new confidence.

EDITORIAL: A NEW COURSE ON IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The stalemate over Iraq's illegal biological and chemical
weapons programs grows increasingly dangerous. U.N. inspectors have
been barred since last December, leaving Baghdad free to rebuild
its stocks of deadly toxins, germs and nerve gas in secret.
</P>
<P>
   Under these circumstances, the Clinton administration is right
to give provisional endorsement to a new U.N. resolution sponsored
by Britain and the Netherlands that may point a way out of the
impasse. In doing so, Washington has put aside its
counterproductive insistence that sanctions against Iraq must
remain in place as long as Saddam Hussein holds power.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution offers Iraq a chance to earn temporary suspension
of some economic sanctions. But to do so, it must readmit U.N.
weapons inspectors and fully honor a list of requirements they
present. Before signing on to this resolution, Washington must make
sure that its provisions will be rigorously interpreted and
strictly enforced.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution would form a new U.N. inspection commission. If
allowed to resume work in Iraq, the new commission would draw up a
list of ``key tasks,'' outlining the specific steps Baghdad must
take to disclose and destroy its illegal weapons and their
ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   The list would include things Iraq has refused to do in the
past, like providing unrestricted access to suspected weapons
production and storage sites and turning over information on what
has happened to ingredients Baghdad is known to have possessed.
</P>
<P>
   If Baghdad complies, it would be eligible for a four-month
suspension of the nine-year-old ban on Iraqi oil exports. Payment
for these exports would go to a U.N. account, and Iraq's use of the
money would be carefully monitored and supervised. The suspension
could be renewed at four-month intervals, depending on continued
Iraqi cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution also provides that the suspensions could
eventually give way to a full lifting of sanctions once the
inspectors are able to declare Iraq fully free of all illegal
weapons _ a constructive change from the previous American
insistence that sanctions could not end as long as Saddam Hussein
remained in power. While it is extremely unlikely that the Iraqi
dictator will ever comply with his disarmament obligations, he
should be given every incentive to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The resolution is likely to be submitted to the Security Council
in the next few days. Washington should make clear that it expects
the new commission to be led by someone as tough as the two
previous chief inspectors, Rolf Ekeus and Richard Butler.
</P>
<P>
   Russia or China might veto such a strict resolution. But these
countries should recognize that it represents a significant shift
in American and British diplomatic strategy on Iraq. To reject it
would dangerously prolong the stalemate and needlessly extend the
economic misery of the Iraqi people.

DEFENDANT IN SLEEPWALKING TRIAL CAN'T ACCOUNT FOR GLOVES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 and RICHARD RUELAS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ The man who says he was sleepwalking when he killed
his wife couldn't explain the gloves he put on before dragging her
into the backyard pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't honestly know where those gloves were on that
particular night before all this happened,'' Scott Falater told
Maricopa County prosecutor Juan Martinez, who says Falater
committed premeditated murder.
</P>
<P>
   Falater took the stand Thursday in Maricopa County Superior
Court.
</P>
<P>
   The gloves are a gap in the defense case, which has featured
testimony by sleepwalking experts that most of Falater's actions on
the night of his wife's death were routine or habitual.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed by Martinez, Falater, 43, said the gloves may have been
in a pile in the garage of his north Phoenix home.
</P>
<P>
   ``That meant that you had to go and sort of match them up,''
said Martinez. His point was clear: Falater's actions were so
purposeful and complex that they prove he committed premeditated
murder.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez claims Falater stabbed his wife 44 times, then put on
the gloves to drag Yarmila into the pool where he snuffed out her
remaining breath. But defense attorneys claim that if the attack
had been premeditated, he would have put the gloves on beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, defense attorney Michael Kimerer guided
Falater through the events leading up to what the defense says was
a fatal episode of sleepwalking for which Falater has complete
amnesia.
</P>
<P>
   Falater said Yarmila fell asleep watching ``ER'' as he made an
abortive attempt to fix the defective pump for the backyard pool.
He said he gently shook her awake and kissed her good night before
going upstairs to sleep, apologizing that he hadn't been able to
fix the broken pool pump in the back yard.
</P>
<P>
   Falater said the next memory he has is of waking up to people
shouting and dogs barking in the back yard.
</P>
<P>
   He went downstairs, he said, where a cop pointed a gun at him
and ordered him down on the carpet.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as he sat handcuffed in a patrol car, he figured it out _
he was the prime suspect in the murder of his wife, Yarmila,
Falater testified.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's slowly dawning on me,'' Falater said of those hours in
the back of a squad car, ``that `Yarm' is hurt, really hurt, and
I'm the guy they think did it because I'm the guy sitting in the
car with handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't see anyone else in handcuffs.''
</P>
<P>
   During cross-examination, Martinez pressed Falater about
removing his Mormon undergarments, which were found streaked with
blood in Falater's car. The prosecutor is challenging the defense
claim that Falater was following a familiar pattern when he changed
into and out of work clothes in his sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez drove his point home after Falater acknowledged that
Mormons customarily don't remove the garments _ which symbolize
commitment to the church _ unless they are about to bathe or the
garments are soiled.
</P>
<P>
   Falater must have been consciously aware that the garments were
bloody, Martinez said, or he would not have removed them and
stashed them in the wheel well of his Volvo station wagon.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez asked Falater, who claims that he always stored work
clothes in the car, how often he removed his Mormon undergarments
in the garage.
</P>
<P>
   `'It's not a thing that would come to mind, that habitually you
would do it?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, that is unusual,'' said Falater.
</P>
<P>
   Falater, 43, could also not explain the mouth guard that police
found with the bloody clothes. Martinez said the mouthpiece, which
DNA evidence has tied to Falater, is evidence that he planned the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez fired away with questions about other troublesome
details, whose cumulative weight he says demands a guilty verdict.
</P>
<P>
   But the prosecutor also fired several apparent duds _ with his
accusation that Falater didn't know his wife's birthday, his claim
that Falater had no reason to be troubled by problems at Motorola,
and his suggestion that the motive for murder may lie in a cryptic
Falater comment about an ``unforgivable sin.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez launched his 90-minute cross-examination with the
sarcasm that has become a trademark of his interrogation of defense
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   If Falater loved Yarmila as devoutly as he claims, ``How is it
that you don't even know her birthday?''
</P>
<P>
   Falater responded coolly that Yarmila's birthday was Feb. 5. But
Martinez, relying on erroneous police records, announced that her
birthday was in September. He backed off when Falater held his
ground, pointing out that the police records were in error.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez also belittled the defense claim that stress at
Motorola, where Falater oversaw a new computer chip that flopped in
the marketplace, helped trigger his tragic sleepwalking episode.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would not have been the first manager who had a project
fail,'' he said, claiming that Motorola seldom fired engineers as
talented as Falater.
</P>
<P>
   Falater, under questioning from Kimerer, laid out a compelling
scenario of stress at his high-tech workplace. While he felt
compelled to recommend that Motorola cut its losses on a failing
project, he knew that some colleagues would brand him a quitter.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez asked Falater why he had mentioned an ``unforgivable
sin'' in an interview with a psychologist after the killing. The
prosecutor suggested darkly that Falater murdered his wife because
he believed she had done something horrific.
</P>
<P>
   Falater offered a benign explanation. In his torment after
Yarmila's death, he said, he thought constantly about ``the
teaching in the church that someone who kills will not have
forgiveness in this world or the world to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Falater said he had gotten little sleep in the nights before the
attack. Workplace stress compounded his tense exhaustion as he went
to sleep that bloody night, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And he talked about frustrations he had over trying to fix a
backyard pool pump. A rubber O-ring in the pump had broken into
pieces, and Falater testified he couldn't dig all of it out with a
screwdriver.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came back inside, Yarm was asleep on the couch,''
Falater told the jury, using his wife's nickname as he often has in
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Kimerer asked him if he had any thoughts about killing his wife
before he retired for the night.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way,'' Falater said. ``That was the furthest thing from my
mind. It's kind of ridiculous to even think about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Falater said he fell into bed without taking his contact lenses
out of his eyes. ``When I'm really tired, I don't want to spend
five minutes fiddling around with (contact lens) solutions,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Falater said it didn't dawn on him that he was the suspect in
his wife's murder until he was actually at the homicide division.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the one going in in the cuffs,'' he said, ``and homicide
means someone's dead.''
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't believe he actually stabbed his wife until a
friend told him details the police were releasing to reporters.
Another neighbor told police he watched Falater dunk his wife's
head underwater.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reaction was that I guess my brain had broken somehow,'' he
said, beginning to cry for the first time on the witness stand
Thursday. ``Maybe there's a tumor in my head or something really
happened in my head.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to describe his emotions about killing his wife,
Falater told of a dream he had about Yarmila about two weeks into
his jail stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yarm was a very tall, white statue with a long flowing gown.
Sort of like an angel, except she wasn't moving,'' he said, sobbing
hard between breaths. ``And I crawled up to her and hugged her feet
and begged her forgiveness.''

PEREZ'S TURN TO BE SKIPPED 
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Lefty Pete Schourek was claimed off waivers by the
Cincinnati Reds in 1994 on the recommendation of manager Davey
Johnson, who prescribed extensive work to cure his control problems
and his drop in velocity.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is now with the Dodgers, and he said Thursday that while
he's skipping lefty Carlos Perez's spot in the rotation, he's
hoping for a similar turnaround from Perez.
</P>
<P>
   ``They got me finishing my pitches out in front more, almost
overextending my follow-through,'' said Schourek, now a reliever
with the Pittsburgh Pirates. ``I wasn't getting anybody out at the
time. I believed anything he said was going to help me because
nothing was working.''
</P>
<P>
   Schourek said he built up arm strength by long-tossing, which
increased his velocity. The next year he went 18-7 with a 3.22 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he wants Perez to do the same type of side work, so
he's nixed his Tuesday start against San Diego. The Dodgers will go
with four starters _ including Darren Dreifort on Saturday _
because of Monday's off-day.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Dodgers don't have a year to wait for Perez to
regain his form. He's 2-8 with a National League-worst 7.38 ERA.
Perez was pulled after 31/3 innings in his start Wednesday, than
bashed a water cooler repeatedly with a bat in frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish he'd attack the hitters like he attacked the water
cooler,'' Johnson said. ``I need him to do a lot of work, doing
some extra work, throwing a lot. I need him, and I need him to get
it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he wasn't sure whether he'd use Perez out of the
bullpen, instead saying it would depend on how Perez progressed
during his side work. Johnson also didn't say whether Perez would
start June 26 at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I get my mechanics back I'm going to get my
fastball back,'' Perez said. ``I was watching video from last year
and my fastball and my mechanics were different. It's not going to
be forever. Trust me. I'll get it back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hundley forecast: The last three days backup catcher Todd
Hundley and bullpen coach Rick Dempsey have been out on the field
early working on throwing drills, and Dempsey said Hundley could be
ready to take back the No.1 catching duties in less than two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would guess from 10 days to two weeks he should be at the
top of his throwing game,'' said Dempsey, a former major-league
catcher. ``He throws 30 to 40 throws and is genuinely fatigued
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson replaced Hundley with Angel Pena on Tuesday. Hundley,
who's thrown out seven of 60 would-be base stealers, is practicing
throws out of the catching position to second and third base.
</P>
<P>
   ``This forces him to do something... that he couldn't do,''
Dempsey said. ``He needed that time in spring training to build up
his endurance. We have to bring it down to build it back. He's
having to retrain himself to be short and quick with his throws.''
</P>
<P>
   F.Y.I.: Because reliever Jamie Arnold threw 40 pitches in relief
Wednesday, Johnson said Dreifort will start Saturday in his normal
place instead of Arnold.... Pirates manager Gene Lamont spends his
pregame strapped in a wheelchair because of intense pain in his
back, which he strained recently. Lamont's been on the bench but
hasn't been making trips to the mound. Bench coach Rick Renick is
the designated arguer in case there's a call with which the Pirates
don't agree.... Outfielder Brent Cookson, a Ventura College and
Long Beach State product, cleared waivers and returned to Triple-A
Albuquerque.... Pitching coach Claude Osteen returned to the
Dodgers after attending the funeral of his mother in Nashville,
Tenn.

MOTHER RECOUNTS SOLIAH'S PAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PHILLIP W. BROWNE AND CHARLES BOSTWICK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As legal experts cast doubt on the 24-year-old
case against former Symbionese Liberation Army member Kathleen Ann
Soliah, her mother said the radical group sought out Soliah, not
the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   She and her brother, Steven, first encountered the SLA after
Soliah spoke at a 1974 memorial rally in Berkeley for six group
members killed in a shootout with police, said Soliah's mother,
Elsie Soliah.
</P>
<P>
   That speech led fugitive SLA members and newspaper heiress
Patricia Hearst _ whom the group had abducted _ to ask Soliah for
help in hiding, she said. Steven Soliah joined them on the run, but
was caught and acquitted of charges that he helped in an SLA bank
robbery. Kathleen Soliah began a life on the lam from charges that
she tried to blow up two police cruisers in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Soliah called his parents shortly after his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing he said was, `We weren't part of that group.
We were helping those people, and I'm sorry we got involved. We
made a mistake,''' his mother said.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the woman believed to be Soliah appeared before a
judge to begin identity and extradition hearings. Captured by the
FBI Wednesday in Minnesota, she did not acknowledge in court that
she is indeed Kathleen Soliah, as authorities insist. The doctor's
wife and mother of three identifies herself as Sara Jane Olson.
</P>
<P>
   Her attorney, Howard Bass, did not confirm that Olson and Soliah
were the same person. But he argued that the crimes Soliah are
charged with in California are not punishable by death or life in
prison, and that bail should be set for his client.
</P>
<P>
   ``And those are only regarding the allegations against Kathleen
Soliah. I haven't even addressed the issues with Sara Olson,'' Bass
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey County District Judge Kathleen Gearin said she would
decide on bail after studying the California statutes. The next
court date is set for July 15.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming Olson is Soliah, the 52-year-old Palmdale High School
graduate is expected to be returned to Los Angeles within six weeks
to face a five-count grand jury indictment issued in Los Angeles in
February 1976.
</P>
<P>
   She is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit murder,
two counts of being in possession of a destructive device and two
counts of attempted murder of police officers. Police and the FBI
believe Soliah tried to blow up two Los Angeles Police Department
squad cars in August 1975 as possible revenge for the May 1974
shootout with police that left six SLA members dead.
</P>
<P>
   But Elsie Soliah said her daughter and son, Steven, were never
SLA members, Elsie Soliah said.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen Soliah was outraged when her actress friend Angela
Atwood was killed with five other SLA members in the 1974 shootout,
she said. That nationally televised incident spurred her comments
at a memorial rally in Berkeley's Ho Chi Minh Park, where she
wished ``good luck'' to Hearst and her associates William and Emily
Harris, who were all on the run from police.
</P>
<P>
   The complicated relationships and the amount of time that has
passed since the Soliahs are expected to be obstacles in the Los
Angeles County District Attorney's efforts to prosecute Soliah.
</P>
<P>
   According to former District Attorney Ira Reiner, the chances of
gaining a conviction in a case so old ranges between poor and
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can forget about any credible testimony,'' Reiner said,
adding that memories fade and jurors may not trust witness
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legally, she should stand trial for the crimes she may have
committed, but that can break down with a jury because there was no
physical harm done and it appears she has led a law-abiding life
since then,'' Reiner said.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons declined to say what
evidence remains against Soliah, but prosecutors are confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've prosecuted cases as old or nearly as old and were
successful,'' Gibbons said, citing three convictions for murders
between 16 and 20 years old. ``But it's true cases do not get
better with age.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurie Levenson, associate dean at Loyola University Law School,
agreed, adding that many jurors may never have heard of the SLA,
which would work against any outrage prosecutors would need to
generate to win the case.
</P>
<P>
   And Soliah could easily point the finger at her alleged
accomplice Jim Kilgore, who remains a fugitive, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jurors are going to ask: With all this crime out there, why
are we spending time prosecution a 25-year-old case against a house
mother who has led a good life, especially since no one was hurt?''
Levenson said.

ON PRO BASKETBALL: UNDERSIZED KNICKS FACE A TALL ORDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ After the New York Knicks practiced on Thursday,
Larry Johnson was caught off guard _ a bit like trying to keep a
pair of 7-footers away from the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you have a gimpy knee, and then I see you out there
with Tim Duncan and David Robinson, and I thought, `Poor fella,'''
a reporter said. ``I mean, what's it like, guarding those giant
sequoias?''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson smiled and swallowed hard. ``That's cold-blooded,'' he
said. ``What's it like guarding me?''
</P>
<P>
   He laughed and rubbed his beard with his left hand, pondering
how to respond. ``I had a rough night; I've got to do things
different,'' he said. ``I've been in this game eight years now and
I got some tricks. But those cats got tricks, too. You can't teach
height. I think the majority of the time those cats just shot over
me and there's not a lot I can do about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is listed at 6 feet 7 inches, but even the small forward
admits he is closer to 6-5. Officially, he gives up between five
and seven inches to the 7-2 Robinson and the 7-foot Tim Duncan, the
two men who combined for 46 points and 25 rebounds in San Antonio's
Game 1 victory Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Johnson got help from his teammates. Other times, he
did not. Either way, his valiant but futile attempt to stop the
Spurs' monstrous frontline was emblematic of the larger picture:
adversity may build character, but it can also beat you down. The
Little Team That Could may not be able to scale Mount
Duncan/Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   With Johnson, their only true low-post scoring threat, barely
able to push off his creaky right knee, the Knicks have to find
another answer. Johnson played 21 minutes on a sprained right knee
ligament and shot 1 of 3 from the floor. He had 5 points over all
and seemed to pass up open 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Size did not pose a problem for the Knicks in the first three
rounds of the playoffs. Now it does.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid falling into an 0-2 rut on Friday night, it would not
be surprising to see Coach Jeff Van Gundy alter his rotations in
the paint. Yet even then, how much the Knicks can compete falls
largely on Johnson. How much he can contribute on offense?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some certain things I can't do,'' Johnson said. ``You
know what? I worry about my offense more than my defense. Because I
know we have to have some low-post threat in this series. We can't
win this series from the perimeter. We've got to be able to go in
there and tackle them big guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's film session told a disturbing tale about the Knicks'
chances. First, there was the sight of Johnson playing defense,
trying to establish a low center of gravity by spreading his legs
and bending his knees so he could keep the big guys out of the key.
That sight was followed by Robinson drawing fouls on him in the
first quarter, and Duncan calling for the ball behind a fronting
Johnson in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   On offense, the frustration continued. Johnson had one beautiful
move in the first half, spinning by Jaren Jackson and getting
Duncan up in the air with a strong pump fake before putting in a
layup off the glass that circled around the rim and fell through
the net.
</P>
<P>
   But the most enduring images came later. Johnson plowed into
Jerome Kersey on the baseline for an offensive foul and failed to
make himself a legitimate threat from beyond the 3-point line.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the Knicks' surprising run through the playoffs
has been about Johnson squaring up from behind the arc and letting
fly those devastating 3-pointers. They hurt Miami and Atlanta, and
shellshocked Indiana. In Game 1 of the NBA finals, he barely looked
at the rim when he was on the perimeter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't looking for it,'' he said, playing down the notion
that he can't push off his right knee from that far away. ``I may
have passed up one or two. But I think I can shoot it.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is hurting, probably more than he will admit, after
spraining the ligament in his right knee against Indiana last
Friday. That he came back for Game 1 is admirable, but more than
anything he has become a symbol for an undermanned, beat-up team
that simply may not have the answers this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to be a burden, just lingering on the floor and
not helping,'' Johnson said. ``I don't think I hampered the team,
which I feel good about. But I definitely didn't do my job well.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy wanted to spread the fouls around in Game 1, but
Robinson was as surprised as anyone to have Johnson guarding him
and Duncan. After facing a barrage of Duncan questions on Thursday,
Johnson finally got fed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Was part of the game plan to go one-on-one with Tim?''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson replied curtly, ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you stop him one-on-one?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' he said, looking away, annoyed.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on that thought a few moments later, he caught
himself giving in to the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, you guys sure like Duncan around here, don't you?'' he
said. ``You know that guy who asked if I could take him one-on-one?
He knew I was just playing around, right?''  &QL;

EDITORIAL: THE POPE GOES HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, June 18:
</P>
<P>
   The flu that intruded on Pope John Paul II's 13-day trip to
Poland was a reminder of the frailty of the 79-year-old pontiff,
adding special poignancy to a visit already full of emotion. Poles,
while rejecting many of the pope's doctrinal orthodoxies,
nevertheless revere the Roman Catholic Church, which for centuries
has been viewed as the guardian of sovereignty in an
often-subjugated land. Many Poles believe that no one did more than
John Paul II to save Poland from Moscow's rule.
</P>
<P>
   Communist control of Poland was already slackening in 1979 when
Karol Wojtyla, who became John Paul II, made his first papal visit
to Poland and exposed the weaknesses of the system. He drew crowds
approaching two million people, and for the nine days he was there,
the Communist state receded into the background. The pope did not
overtly attack the government, but urged his compatriots to think
for themselves. The next year, Solidarity was born.
</P>
<P>
   Most Poles had never been conforming Communists, in large part
because of the church _ one of the few social organizations
anywhere in the Soviet bloc that the authorities did not control.
By the late 1960s, Cardinal Wojtyla and Poland's primate, Cardinal
Stefan Wyszynski, charged the Communist regime with violating
Poles' basic human rights. They gave shelter to the opposition.
Cardinal Wojtyla even played host at a banned lecture on George
Orwell's ``1984.''
</P>
<P>
   The church's defiance softened the harshness of Moscow's rule.
Collectivization of agriculture and political purges were
relatively mild. Poles could speak more freely than their
neighbors. Poland's military even had priests as chaplains.
</P>
<P>
   But Poles have proved as creative in their practice of
Catholicism as they were with Communism, angering the pope. In
surveys, most Poles have disagreed with church teaching on divorce,
birth control and abortion. The church's open attempts to influence
politics have often backfired. Today, young people in a rapidly
growing Poland scoff at the pope's rejection of consumerism. But
none of this makes John Paul II less beloved, as the large and
passionate crowds he has attracted on this trip, which concluded on
Thursday, show. Poles may not follow his teachings. But to them,
John Paul II is a powerful symbol and moral force.  &QL;

MARINERS SHOW ALL-AROUND GAME IN BEATING TIGERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Home runs? Yes, one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Working the count? Got it. Strong defense? Check. Clutch
hitting? Solid starting pitching? A save from the closer?
</P>
<P>
   A successful squeeze bunt?
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to find any component of the game that the Mariners
did not execute when they had to Thursday night. They needed every
bit of it to beat Jeff Weaver and the Detroit Tigers, 4-3, in the
last game Seattle ever will play at Tiger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a couple of years since we've won a game like
that,'' said Mariners shortstop Alex Rodriguez, who homered in the
seventh. ``We've done it a little bit more consistently this year,
and it feels good. Our team is a much better defensive ballclub,
and Freddy Garcia is really emerging as our ace. We had a little
bit of everything tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The game matched the two best 22-year-old starters in baseball,
and both right-handers threw eight strong innings. Weaver used a
hard slider to hold the M's to one run, and Garcia used his
fastball-curve-change assortment to limit the Tigers to two.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia (8-3) allowed six hits and had seven strikeouts, each
coming with men on base. Weaver allowed five hits and had five
strikeouts, and turned over a 2-1 lead to the bullpen in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr. fell behind left-hander C.J. Nitkowski, 0-and-2,
but recovered to foul off a few pitches and draw a leadoff walk.
Butch Huskey singled off Todd Jones, and a triple by David Segui
brought in two runs. Huskey raised his fist as he crossed home
plate, which drew belly laughs in the M's clubhouse as the
highlight was shown on TV.
</P>
<P>
   The rally came with two big bats out of the lineup _ Jay Buhner,
who has a strained hamstring, and Edgar Martinez, who has a sore
elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``From top to bottom, we have a good team,'' said Huskey. ``It
doesn't happen all the time, but the longer the game goes on, the
better our hitters get. It's just that much more potent if Jay and
Edgar are in there.''
</P>
<P>
   After a one-out intentional walk, David Bell came to the plate
and looked for the sign from third-base coach Steve Smith. It was
something he hadn't seen all year, and a play the M's haven't
called since spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Sqeeze.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just relieved that I got the sign (right),'' Bell said.
``It's not something you look for every day. Once I got it, really
all you have to do is get it in fair territory. It doesn't matter
how hard you bunt it, as long as you get it down. It was a pretty
good pitch to bunt, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell tapped the high fastball _ the first bunt of any kind for
him all year _ back to Jones, who had no play on the streaking
Segui and had to throw Bell out at first.
</P>
<P>
   That run would matter, because closer Jose Mesa allowed a
one-out, solo homer to Gabe Kapler in the ninth. But Mesa got Gregg
Jefferies to bounce out and Karim Garcia to fly out, ending the
game and earning his 14th save in 15 chances.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners may not have been in position to win had they not
gotten two fine defensive plays to halt a Tiger rally in the
eighth. Bobby Higginson led off with a single, and Palmer was hit
by Garcia, who leaped in despair after the pitch.
</P>
<P>
   But Dan Wilson threw out Higginson trying to steal third, Tony
Clark struck out and Bell snared a wicked liner by Damion Easley to
keep the Tigers' lead at 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Higginson got a fairly good jump, and Wilson made just an
absolutely perfect throw,'' said Mariners manager Lou Piniella.
``It had to be perfect. And (John) Mabry made a good, quick tag at
third.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Tigers, it was the fifth time in the past 16 games
they've lost despite leading in the seventh or later. The Mariners'
winning rally spoiled the effort of Weaver, the former Texas A&AMP;M
star who was the 14th player picked in last year's draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was excited about leaving Tiger Stadium with a bang, and
then we got the reward of having Mr. Weaver on the mound, which is
no day at the picnic against righties,'' said Rodriguez, who became
the first right-handed hitter to homer off Weaver. ``He had good
stuff. This was the first time I've faced him, and today we were
feeling each other out a little bit. It's going to be fun facing
him over the years, because he's going to be around a while.''
</P>
<P>
   So will Garcia, if he pitches more games like Thursday night's
and fewer like his prior start, when he lasted two innings and
allowed five runs in a loss to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, I felt good in my mechanics,'' Garcia said. ``The last
time I pitched, at home, I felt pretty good in the bullpen, but I
got to the game, and everything changed. Tonight, I had a good
bullpen and took it into the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella was happy about all of it, saying he enjoyed the
pitchers' duel and the way his club came back. More all-around
efforts like this, and the Mariners should turn out just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team's been playing hard all year,'' Piniella said.
``We've been trying to put together the best combination of
pitching we can, and if that settles down for us, we could have a
little fun with this team.''

POPOVICH AND VAN GUNDY: TWO FORGETTABLE COACHES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ The most useful information that will emerge from
the 1999 NBA Finals is not new, but regularly forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   In the NBA, coaching is overrated.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence: Gregg Popovich and Jeff Van Gundy.
</P>
<P>
   Pro hoops would be hard-pressed to find two more colorless,
resume-light coaches than the men leading the San Antonio Spurs and
New York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   No NBA playing background, either as star or thoughtful reserve.
No extensive tutelege under wizened masters. No high-profile
college-coaching deeds. Until the last month, no dazzling
achievements in their short NBA head-coaching tenures.
</P>
<P>
   Just a couple of career hoop hacks who are bloody lucky.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say that either man is a bad coach, nor that
coaching does not have some value. But to those Sonics fans who
agonize over the departure of George Karl and worry about the
future under Paul Westphal, and who also fear the arrival in the
Pacific Division of Chief Running Triangle, Phil Jackson, the
presence of Popovich and Jeff Van Gundy at the summit offers
reassurance.
</P>
<P>
   Never forget that most coaches are too old, short and fat to
make the outlet pass and fill the lane on the break. The club
employees who are capable of such feats are where the differences
reside in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   No less a figure than Popovich admitted same in the run-up to
the Finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of coaches who could take this team to the NBA
Finals,'' he said, offering an observation that makes him the '99
leader in the clubhouse for the Full Reverse Nethercutt Award for
honesty in public affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The presence in the Spurs lineup of David Robinson and Tim
Duncan, highly skilled big men taken, improbably, 10 years apart as
the No. 1 player in their respective drafts, is why Popovich has
entered the national semi-consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy, on the other hand, is here virtually despite himself.
For much of the stumpy regular season, he resisted giving time to
Latrell Sprewell and Marcus Camby, two players whose acquisitions
Van Gundy fought. Now, of course, Sprewell and Camby, thanks to
injuries that forced Van Gundy into playing them, are the main
reasons the Knicks are the first No. 8 seed to make a Finals
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   But a few years from now, nearly all that will be recalled of
the Knicks' great adventure was that Van Gundy must have been some
kind of coach to out-smart Miami's Pat Riley, Atlanta's Lenny
Wilkens and Indiana's Larry Bird to reach the championship.
</P>
<P>
   While he's done well in keeping the team together despite the
tumultuous events in New York, Van Gundy, in his fourth season as
head coach, isn't quite as secure as Popovich in admitting that
anyone could have done it. For good reason.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Popovich, he's not the franchise's general manager, too.
Van Gundy's GM and chief backer, Ernie Grunfeld, was fired in
mid-April as the Knicks teetered on the edge of the playoffs. Club
president Dave Checketts then made an ill-advised overture to
Jackson about coaching the Knicks if Van Gundy were also ousted.
Word leaked, Checketts denied, then admitted his denial was a lie.
</P>
<P>
   The mess has made Van Gundy appear the victim, and so he has
been embraced and exalted by Knick fans and the tabloid media that
plays to them. He is now cast as many New Yorkers see themselves: A
gritty, proud survivor of a harsh life.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good story line but has little to do with whether he's a
capable coach. That description may well fall to him if he manages
to coax at least one win out of a series in which his team is
almost entirely overmatched.
</P>
<P>
   Popovich, on the other hand, is still trying to erase a mess of
his own doing that will take every bit of a championship aura to
obscure. On the same day in late 1996 when Robinson was returning
from the injured list, Popovich fired coach Bob Hill and replaced
him with _ Popovich.
</P>
<P>
   Completely free of previous pro head-coaching experience, the
former boss at Air Force Academy nevertheless felt he was
well-suited to do both jobs, a conclusion endorsed by club
ownership but condemned by most fans, who made the nondescript Hill
into a martyr.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as February, when the Spurs were 6-8, fans and media
were recalling Popovich's dubious ascension and undistinguished
stint as reasons to off him. Four months later, he's the architect
and engineer of the biggest event in South Texas sports history.
</P>
<P>
   What happened?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I read a book and got smart,'' he said Thursday, amused at
his sudden anointment. Actually what Popovich understood a little
better than some of his more obsessive contemporaries was that when
all the X's and O's fail, be sure that your best players are 7 feet
each.
</P>
<P>
   ``Speaking for myself, I would say the biggest thing that I've
learned over the years is that these players are pretty smart,'' he
said. ``And their participation is really important in trying to
put something on the court that they can really believe in and want
to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get into the league, you might think you've got some
answers and you're going to do it a certain way. It's good to have
a foundation, but I think you really need to listen, because the
players know what the hell's going on out there.''
</P>
<P>
   That conviction is a little easier to adopt when the stars are
Robinson and Duncan, two of the NBA's brightest, most even-tempered
and cooperative players. When it's Gary Payton, Allen Iverson,
Alonzo Mourning, Sprewell and a number of others, the chore is more
onerous.
</P>
<P>
   But the point is still the same in the NBA: Players remain the
name of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The other names, be they Popovich and Van Gundy, or Jackson or
Riley or Karl or Westphal, are highly interchangeable, albeit
objects who often appear larger in the rear-view mirror.

AKERS LEADS BY EXAMPLE, STILL FUELS U.S. WOMEN'S TEAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARTINSVILLE, N.J. _ On a perfectly manicured field at the
private school where the U.S. Women's World Cup team practiced
Thursday, a soccer ball was driven over a fence with a thunderous
boom.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt about it. That was a Michelle Akers shot, though this
one was just a hair over the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
   Akers quickly corrected herself. Her next five shots blazed
through the goalmouth, curling at wild angles past the hands of the
stand-in goalkeeper before scorching the back of the poor net.
</P>
<P>
   At age 33 and now called the grand dame of women's soccer after
her roughneck start in boys' leagues back in Seattle, some things
about Akers have not changed. Her hair is still a curled mane. Her
will to work, compete and win is still undeniable. Her Christian
faith and ministry is her bedrock.
</P>
<P>
   And that massive shot is still as potent and percussive as ever.
</P>
<P>
   It was Akers' booming foot that kicked the game-tying goal
during the semifinals of the 1996 Olympics. The U.S. was trailing
1-0 when Norway was whistled for a handball, and it was Akers who
demanded to take the penalty shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just knew it would go in,'' Akers said.
</P>
<P>
   After tying the score, the U.S. went on to win the game, the
gold medal and, in the process, lift recognition of women's soccer
to a new level. This World Cup is being billed as the largest
women's sporting event in the world, ever.
</P>
<P>
   What has changed, though, since Akers led the U.S. women to the
first World Cup championship in 1991 are her perspective and sense
of self-preservation.
</P>
<P>
   You learn that after years of injuries and chronic fatigue
syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   What also has changed since Akers became the first lady of
soccer is her position. Where once she was a forward who ran
through every defense in the world, now Akers is the midfielder
through whom the plays must go.
</P>
<P>
   The move by U.S. coach Tony DiCicco was orchestrated a few years
back, although the only way DiCicco could convince Akers to accept
the change was to promise it would extend her stellar career.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the heavily favored U.S. women set to open the 1999
World Cup Saturday against Denmark in front of 76,000 at Giants
Stadium, everyone with an interest in seeing the U.S. women do what
they do best should be thrilled Akers is still such an integral
part of this U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   Teammates like co-captain Julie Foudy are.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all her knee injuries and concussions and Epstein-Barr
(chronic fatigue syndrome) and all that goes on, playing up top is
a lot different position. You're always getting whacked from behind
and you're taking a lot of physical contact,'' Foudy said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``With her up there as a target, she was an easy prey and
obviously taking a lot of abuse physically. So when Tony placed her
in the midfield, you're playing facing your own goal then with your
back to the goal, so she's not having to take as many hits.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what was supposed to happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now instead of getting hit in the legs and from behind,
I'm just crashing into people head-on,'' Akers said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Something about Akers attracts collisions and busted bones.She
has had so many knee surgeries, she can't remember how many.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eleven or 12,'' she said. ``I lost track.''
</P>
<P>
   Akers was knocked out of a World Cup All-Star game last February
when she broke an orbital bone in her face, requiring more stitches
than a soccer ball and surgery, too.
</P>
<P>
   She had collided in mid-air with Norway star Linda Medalen,
another 33-year old veteran who knows that Akers is as much the key
to the U.S.'s attack as Mia Hamm, Kristine Lilly and Tiffeny
Milbrett.
</P>
<P>
   If the engine is shut down, there's a good chance the car won't
be running.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how many players could go from being a great
forward to a great playmaker with a lot of touch and skill and
play-making ability and the technical ability to set play for us in
the middle,'' Foudy said about Akers.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. lost in the semifinals during the 1995 Women's World
Cup and many of the players are highly motivated to avenge this
defeat. Akers, however, is not quite so driven by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is in the forefront of a lot of their minds. In
some ways, it's their fuel. A lot of them don't want to experience
that again and I don't either, but that's not what drives me,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lessons I have learned in the World Cup, I have put them
into action for my preparation. I think what was difficult (in '95)
were all the distractions. There was a lot more attention. I
thought we overtrained. I think our legs were burnt. I think our
performance was flat. Our spring wasn't there, so our staff and our
team have made note of that and made sure not to make the same
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Although she has been told time and again that her chronic
fatigue symptoms would ease if she quit playing, Akers has refused.
She wants to see this thing through. What she helped start in '91
by winning the first Cup has set off a chain reaction in the sport
she loves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Michelle's strength is definitely by example,'' Foudy
said. ``She's definitely vocal, but when you watch her play, she's
running over people. That's always been her strength. She's even
had to restrain herself. You can't go on and win every tackle. You
can't go and win every ball when it's 90 percent not on your favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's the great thing about playing beside Michelle. You
know that any game she's going to leave everything on the field,
even a few bones and teeth. That's what you love about her and why
you love having her on your team.''
</P>
<P>
   The big engine is still running. She's the one in the middle
now, the turnstile everything must pass through.

EDITORIAL: A MEDAL FOR ROSA PARKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, June 18:
</P>
<P>
   With President Clinton, the congressional leadership and a
half-dozen aging warriors of the civil rights movement looking on,
Congress on Tuesday awarded its highest civilian honor, the
Congressional Gold Medal, to Rosa Parks, the heroine of the
Montgomery bus boycott.
</P>
<P>
   The medal was a long time in coming. Congress and the nation
have owed Mrs. Parks, now 86, a large debt ever since Dec. 1, 1955,
the fateful day when she refused to yield her seat to a white man
on the Cleveland Avenue bus in Montgomery, Ala., and was promptly
arrested under a city ordinance requiring segregated buses. The
arrest touched off a 381-day bus boycott organized by the Rev.
Martin Luther King Jr., gave King national stature and pumped new
life into a fragile and fitful civil rights movement that, after
another decade of struggle, eventually forced Congress to approve
the watershed civil rights legislation of the mid-1960s.
</P>
<P>
   As is often the case with heroes, a few myths have attached
themselves to Mrs. Parks' story, chiefly the notion that she was
only a tired seamstress with sore feet who just wouldn't move when
the bus driver told her to. She was a seamstress all right, but she
was also a seasoned activist and an official in the Montgomery
chapter of the NAACP, which turned her case into a formal and
ultimately successful challenge to the city's bus laws. She was
indeed tired, but what had tired her was not her work but
injustice, and what anchored her to her seat _ in King's words _
were ``the accumulated indignities of days gone by and the
countless aspirations of generations yet unborn.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Parks knew that her brave act would change her life, and it
did. After a series of threats, she and her husband moved in 1957
to Detroit, where she has lived ever since. Many honors have come
her way, many streets have been named after her, but the
Congressional Gold Medal is especially fitting. For it was in
Congress that Mrs. Parks' aspirations for equal treatment were
codified, at long last, into law.

EVEN M'S SEARCH FOR SOUVENIRS OF TIGER STADIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ There's a general consensus that Detroit's Tiger
Stadium, which has stood at the corner of Michigan and Trumbull
since the day the Titanic sunk in 1912, has served its purpose. The
Tigers will move into new Comerica Park next season, one of five
facilities to open by the start of the 2000 season.
</P>
<P>
   But several Mariners were on the look out for souvenirs of their
last trip to the park, where the M's have gone 46-82.
</P>
<P>
   Video coordinator Carl Hamilton, from Benton Harbor, Mich., saw
his first baseball game from the left field upper deck at Tiger
Stadium. He had Hall of Fame Tigers broadcaster Ernie Harwell sign
a photo of the ballpark before last night's game.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Rafael Bournigal said he wants to buy some Tiger
Stadium seats to put by the pool at his home, though he's
interested only in the green, wooden seats that used to ring the
park.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few years ago, I had a chance to buy some seats from the old
Comiskey Park in Chicago, for $100 each,'' Bournigal said. ``I've
always wished I'd bought them.''
</P>
<P>
   Piniella said he might keep the final lineup card he fills out
at Tiger Stadium, and reliever Aaron Scheffer said some players
wanted to scoop up some dirt off the field.
</P>
<P>
   Outfielder Matt Mieske, a native of Midland, Mich., attended
about five Tigers games a year as a kid, and was there when Detroit
clinched the 1984 American League pennant. The first photos of
Mieske in a big league uniform were taken at Tiger Stadium, and he
also has a video of himself hitting there.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't looking for more souvenirs Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's enough,'' Mieske said. ``And just the memories _ you
can't take those away. I'll always remember the special times
coming down here with my dad. You don't need pictures to remind you
of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners are the first American League team to make its last
visit to Tiger Stadium this summer.
</P>
<P>
   BREAK TIME: Ever since spring training, left-hander Jeff Fassero
has maintained that the minor surgery on his throwing elbow last
winter had no affect on him. He reiterated that Thursday, and the
M's also say he is healthy.
</P>
<P>
   But at least one of the reasons Fassero is moving to the bullpen
is to give his arm a rest. The Mariners want to see Fassero work
through his problems and return to the rotation, and a lighter
workload should mean he'll be fresh for the second half of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think probably his arm is not as strong as it could be,''
Piniella said. ``Myself, I think that's a good part of it. I don't
think he's gotten back to his total arm strength. I think pitching
out of the bullpen will help him with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Said pitching coach Stan Williams: ``His stuff seems to go
backwards after four or five innings. This is just speculation, but
maybe it's because he was cut on. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeff is a much better pitcher than that, and he's healthy. So
there's no reason Jeff Fassero can't get back to being Jeff
Fassero.''
</P>
<P>
   AROUND THE HORN: Piniella had a note waiting for him on his desk
in the visitors clubhouse Thursday. The message: ``I'm going to
play center field.'' And so Ken Griffey Jr., who had played
designated hitter the past two nights, got one more chance to play
center at Tiger Stadium. . . . The Mariners announced that the
final game at the Kingdome, on July 27 against Texas, is sold out.
Former Mariners Diego Segui, Ruppert Jones, Gaylord Perry and Alvin
Davis will be on hand for a post-game celebration. . . .
Right-hander Paul Abbott will need at least one more start for
Class AAA Tacoma before joining the M's. Abbott pitched well
Tuesday, but the Mariners would like his pitches to be a little
sharper. . . . Designated hitter Edgar Martinez, who did not start
in the four-game Detroit series, could be ready Friday. He has a
sore left elbow. . . . The Mariners had discussions about signing
former Oakland knuckleballer Tom Candiotti, who was released
Wednesday and can be signed for the minimum salary. But with Abbott
coming back and Frankie Rodriguez pitching well, the M's are
unlikely to pursue Candiotti. . . . The Mariners are the only team
in baseball without a complete game thrown for or against them this
year.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Often, said Comets coach Van Chancellor, the first analytical
utterings to come from a coach's mouth after a game can be a bit
confusing and even misleading.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Such was the case Thursday night after the Comets razed the Utah
Starzz 93-73 at Compaq Center to run their record to 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   From the opening horn almost until the very end, the Comets,
spurred by the efforts of cat-quick Sheryl Swoopes, put the Starzz
in a defensive vise and by halftime already had the game well in
hand.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when Chancellor began his postgame analysis, he talked
more about an offense that fed off 30 points from Cynthia Cooper
(23 in the first half) and 25 from Swoopes.
</P>
<P>
   He downplayed the facet of the game Utah coach Frank Layden
pointed to as the linchpin to his team's second straight loss after
a season-opening win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense wasn't what I wanted it to be,'' Chancellor said.
``When (the lead grows) to the 20-point range, it's hard to keep
that defensive intensity. But I was pretty pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor was then informed that Layden called the Comets'
defense the key to the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that got us the lead,'' Chancellor said. ``We forced
a lot of turnovers (11 in the first half, 20 for the game). They
only got two more rebounds than we did, and we had only 11
turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, the more I think about it, I would have to say we were
better defensively than I (originally) thought we were. I just
didn't want to give up 73 points to nobody.''
</P>
<P>
   Setting the tone early, Swoopes had 12 points and three of her
four steals in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Utah was looking up from a 53-34 deficit by
intermission and Layden was looking for solutions to a confounding
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to our team at halftime, they (the Comets) do a
terrific job defensively,'' he said. ``They don't let you get
started; they don't let you run what you want. And they take
control of the game through a great defensive effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Too bad for Layden and the Starzz, the Comets' defense never
rested.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper took charge of the other side of the ball, starting
slowly and then showing once more why she has been the league's
leading scorer each of the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was able to get some open looks because of the picks I was
getting from Tina Thompson and Polina Tzekova,'' Cooper said.
``They were really working hard to get me open, and because of that
I got a lot of open looks. When you get those type of looks, the
only thing you have to do is put them down.''
</P>
<P>
   Simply stated. And Cooper made it look easy while shooting
9-of-17 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think we did well, especially on the fast break,''
Cooper said. ``We got some easy buckets because of our defense.
Once our defense got going, there's no way you could stop us.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a night when the Comets, usually prolific from 3-point
range, were only 5-of-23 from behind the arc. Yet Swoopes was
12-for-18 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson contributed 13 points and Tzekova 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets scored 17 points off the break while slowing the
Starzz, who have turned to an up-tempo game this season, to a mere
two fast-break points.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the Starzz (1-2) has usually been a huge problem for
the Comets.
</P>
<P>
   But the razor-sharp anticipation of Swoopes on defense and the
fireworks of Cooper and Swoopes negated the Comets' height
disadvantage and gave Layden some big problems of his own with
which to contend.
</P>
<P>
   Like a cat lying in the bushes ready to pounce on its prey,
Swoopes time and again in the opening period disrupted the
offensive flow of the Starzz.
</P>
<P>
   Her second steal and fast-break layup staked the Comets to a
14-8 lead. She later would tip a Utah pass into the hands of point
guard Sonja Henning.
</P>
<P>
   On the other end, Henning assisted on a layup by Cooper that
resulted in a three-point play.
</P>
<P>
   The lead was up to 19-9. But when Adrienne Goodson, one of
Utah's three American Basketball League refugees, fired in a
3-pointer three minutes later, the Starzz had cut the lead to
24-18.
</P>
<P>
   It was with Utah close at 26-20 that Cooper began to kick it
into high gear. She scored 10 of the Comets' 12 points during a
2:21 span, and Utah was suddenly looking up at a 38-26 deficit.
</P>
<P>
   Down by 19 points at halftime, Utah never got closer than 15 in
the second period.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played hard,'' said Layden, ``but we made a lot of unforced
errors. I have to give the Comets a lot of credit. They're a
terrific team.''

COMPANY GETS VATICAN LICENSING CONTRACT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A firm has been given the Vatican's blessing to
sell merchandise based on the church's art and artifacts to the
masses.
</P>
<P>
   November Lazar Scher Inc., a product licensing and marketing
consulting firm in Studio City, has been hired to organize a
licensing and merchandising program based on objects in the Vatican
Treasury Museum, which houses a vast collection ranging from works
by Gianlorenzo Bernini to papal gifts from heads of state to
chalices and crosses.
</P>
<P>
   The merchandise won't necessarily be, say, replicas of statues
in the Vatican's collection, said Mark November, a partner with the
firm. Rather, merchandise could include linens, lampshades,
tableware and gifts and other products, all based on the Vatican
objects.
</P>
<P>
   ``The objects are going to be sold in many different ways,''
November said. ``The most important thing that concerns us is the
quality of the products and that they are truly inspirational to
our buyers.''
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturers would be licensed to use the name Vatican
Treasury Collection as a brand and pay royalties for the licenses.
Part of the proceeds would go back to the Vatican, and the rest
would cover such things as commissions and administrative costs.
</P>
<P>
   A few select items will be available this holiday season, but
the ``overwhelming bulk'' of them will be released over the next
three to five years, November said.
</P>
<P>
   November Lazar Scher has plenty of experience in such
merchandising programs, having helped develop products based on
almost every Walt Disney Co. property of the past 10 years, as well
as products based on ``Jurassic Park,'' ``Star Trek'' and ``The
X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   The firm's solid reputation is what attracted Gerald Colapinto,
the Vatican Treasury Collection's licensing and marketing director,
who contracted the local company in February after a months-long,
coast-to-coast search.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a brand that's unquestionably the most recognizable
brand in the world, and we wanted to complement that with a sales
force that had a reputation for handling wholesome and good
brands,'' Colapinto said.
</P>
<P>
   All merchandise must receive the Vatican's blessing before it is
manufactured and sold, Colapinto said. And the manufacturers
themselves will be carefully selected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everyone who seeks a license receives a license,'' he
said. ``It's not based on finances as much as how that company will
represent the Vatican products in the best light.''
</P>
<P>
   Products will be sold through regular retail outlets and through
a chain of stores that the Vatican Treasury Collection is creating.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working with a major, major, major force in New York on
developing the store program,'' Colapinto said.
</P>
<P>
   The flagship store should open in Manhattan in 18 months to two
years.
</P>
<P>
   But a University of Southern California religion professor
thinks the stores, and the merchandise, for that matter, could
cheapen one of the world's most popular religions.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not they're religious, the fact that the objects come
from the Vatican will give the merchandise based on them a
religious patina that could add to its value, said John P. Crossley
Jr., associate professor and director of the School of Religion at
the University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   That, in turn, commercializes religion _ and perhaps cheapens
it, he said. It's one thing when merchants in Giverny, France, sell
handbags and place mats based on paintings by French Impressionist
and native son Claude Monet.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when the church does this and decides it has some Berninis
or whatever, that it can do the same thing the Monet Foundation can
do, I personally think it's somewhat tasteless,'' Crossley said.
``I don't think it's high class to license their treasures to put
on handbags and place mats or whatever.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I meant when I said it cheapens religion. It
commercializes it.''
</P>
<P>
   Be that as it may, the merchandise is likely to find plenty of
buyers _ though it may not be for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Like other licensed collectibles, the Vatican Treasury
merchandise may strike some as junk, said Richard Giss, a partner
with the trade retail services group of accounting firm Deloitte &AMP;
Touche LLP in Los Angeles. But for others, they may be real
treasures that tap into their religious sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to be for everybody, but I don't presume
they're going to think it will be,'' Giss said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In 1994, Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., faced the
toughest vote in his long congressional career: whether to ban
assault weapons.
</P>
<P>
   A proud board member of the National Rifle Association at the
time, Dingell hated the measure. But President Clinton was urging
him to support it and his party leaders were demanding loyalty. So
Dingell, an avid hunter who adorns his Capitol Hill office with the
stuffed heads of wild boar and other game he has bagged, quit the
NRA board and voted yes, infuriating friends and even one of his
sons. He has regretted it ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Months after the assault weapons ban passed, the Republicans
swept into control of Congress, stripping Dingell of his powerful
position as chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee. He was
convinced that a major factor was his party's fervent support for
tough gun control.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Dingell has championed a measure that has
angered gun-control advocates, confounded his party leaders, given
heart to conservative Democrats squeamish about gun restrictions,
and won support from Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, the majority whip and
a fierce opponent of gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Dingell's amendment, which the House narrowly approved late
Thursday night, is a weaker alternative to a bill supported by the
House Democratic leadership that requires criminal background
checks of gun buyers at gun shows. Dingell's amendment, which has
been endorsed by the NRA, would require the checks in 24 hours, as
opposed to three days in the Democrats' bill, or let the sale
proceed.
</P>
<P>
   To the many advocates of gun control in his party, Dingell's
bill undercut the Democrats' efforts to portray Republicans as
unreasonable opponents of reasonable gun restrictions, trapped in
the pocket of the NRA. Moreover, Dingell's amendment may have
demonstrated that the Democrats are far from united on gun control,
and that the issue may not be as potent in the 2000 elections as
many Democrats had hoped.
</P>
<P>
   ``His bill hurts our message,'' said Rep. Louise Slaughter, a
Democrat from Rochester, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   But in Dingell's mind, he has been acting like a loyal Democrat,
trying to save his party from itself, and from a replay of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows if Democrats don't do the right thing, they are not
going to retake the House in 2000,'' said his wife, Deborah,
president of General Motors Foundation, whose advocacy of gun
control puts her in conflict with her husband's views. ``He
absolutely believes he is helping the party.''
</P>
<P>
   A barrel-chested, gruff-voiced 72-year-old whose 44 years in the
House makes him its longest-serving member, Dingell scoffs at the
suggestion that he has hurt his party, saying he has simply given
voice to the desires of his blue-collar district, which runs from
Dearborn south along Lake Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``My people love the out of doors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the possibility that some felons might be more
easily able to buy guns at gun shows under his bill, Dingell leaned
his 6-foot frame into a questioner and wrapped his mittlike hands
around his shoulder. ``When do you think you will get a perfect
world?'' he asked with a wry smile. ``I'm just trying here to get a
better bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats assert that Dingell used the possibility of a
Democratic victory in 2000 to cajole his party mates to vote for
his bill. If the Democrats retake the House, Dingell would regain
his chairmanship of the powerful Commerce Committee, which controls
legislation on a wide range of matters, from telecommunications to
energy to defense contracting. As chairman in the 1980s, Dingell
was widely known as a procedural genius, a zealous investigator of
government waste, and a bit of a bully.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very powerful man,'' said Rep. Carolyn McCarthy,
D-N.Y., who is author of the other Democratic gun show bill. ``A
lot of things go through his committee. And he might be chairman
again.''
</P>
<P>
   To which Dingell replied, his voice dripping with innocence,
``Why should anyone be afraid of me?''
</P>
<P>
   Dingell, a former county prosecutor, was first elected to
Congress in 1955 to replace his father, who had held the seat for
23 years. He describes himself as an ``old-fashioned, New Deal
Democrat,'' but his record has been hard to categorize.
</P>
<P>
   With Ford Motor Co. in his district, he has frequently fought
environmentalists over air pollution regulations. But he was also a
major proponent of the Clean Water Act and Endangered Species Act.
While he has battled his party on gun control, he has carried its
banner on health care reform, currently pushing bills intended to
protect managed care consumers.
</P>
<P>
   And while he likes hunting, fishing and other traditionally
masculine sports, he is also an avid fan of the ballet and opera,
who raised his four children after divorcing his first wife.
</P>
<P>
   As an NRA board member in the 1970s, Dingell helped create the
rifle association's Institute for Legislative Affairs, which has
evolved into one of the most powerful lobbying and political action
committees in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   He is also famous for calling Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms agents ``a jackbooted group of fascists'' in a 1981 NRA
promotional film. He says he has no regrets about coining the
phrase, saying, ``If it's true, what is wrong with it?''
</P>
<P>
   Dingell says he is planning on running for re-election next
year. And he says he fully expects his party to retake the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll be working for it,'' he said.

PAYMENTS TO DESCENDANTS WOULD HEAL WOUNDS OF SLAVERY, ADVOCATE
SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By OSCAR AVILA  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ Eugene Frison sees something missing in his mostly
black neighborhood north of downtown. Few economic opportunities,
scant political power, not enough harmony with white residents.
</P>
<P>
   He has a solution.
</P>
<P>
   Frison, 74, says reparations for the descendants of slaves would
allow black Americans to catch up to the economic head start of
whites. Reparations also would bury resentment and guilt left over
from slavery, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the most important issue the world has ever faced. We're
still feeling the effects,'' Frison said.
</P>
<P>
   Frison and his group, the National Coalition of Blacks for
Reparations in America, want the government to pay trillions of
dollars. The group expects about 300 people at its national
convention this weekend in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Frison has spoken at city meetings, churches and businesses. One
wall at the group's local headquarters is covered by letters to
legislators. Another wall is papered with pictures of Martin Luther
King Jr., Malcolm X and other icons.
</P>
<P>
   Many of all races are not sure the idea would work. How would
black Americans prove they descended from slaves? Where would the
money come from?
</P>
<P>
   The notion isn't new.
</P>
<P>
   After the Civil War, the government promised former slaves a
settlement of 40 acres of land and a mule. Congress passed a
reparations bill, but President Andrew Johnson vetoed it.
</P>
<P>
   Frison's rationale is this: Slaves themselves were part of the
wealth whites amassed _ some estimate they pumped $8 billion into
the economy. When they were freed, they got none of it. They found
it hard to buy land or start businesses.
</P>
<P>
   That lack of capital, coupled by Jim Crow laws, made it tougher
for black Americans to buy homes and create housing equity to pass
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``White people are living pretty good in America, and it came
through the slavery system,'' said Frison, the conference
organizer.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of reparations regained momentum in 1988 when the
government paid settlements to the families of Japanese-Americans
interned in concentration camps during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   But recent reparation bills have gone nowhere in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 poll found that two-thirds of blacks support a national
apology for slavery and reparations. On the flip side, two-thirds
of whites oppose an apology and 88 percent oppose reparations.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of white people say black people don't need this.
They've been out of slavery for 150 years. Why should we give them
money?'' said Ray Winbush, director of the Race Relations Institute
at Fisk University in Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we've been using bubble gum to patch up what this country
has been doing to black Americans for centuries. This could be a
way to fix it in one fell swoop,'' Winbush said.
</P>
<P>
   Winbush said he thinks reparations will happen. Others, such as
sociologist Thomas Shapiro of Northeastern University, warn that
reparations could spur a backlash from white Americans who don't
feel responsible.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents note that most white Americans of the 1800s weren't
slaveholders. Some fought for abolition. Others point to post-Civil
War immigrants who had nothing to do with slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Frison said his group's plan demands money for education,
economic development and individual settlements. Frison said the
resources would allow black Americans to gain more power in banks,
police departments and schools.
</P>
<P>
   Frison also says black Americans need political power. He
suggests that states donate land so blacks can establish a
political base.
</P>
<P>
   If reparations happen, Frison says, affirmative action should
end.
</P>
<P>
   Frison, who worked with the Nation of Islam and as a deputy
sheriff, said his biggest challenge has been opening people's
minds. He said blacks and whites are equally skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our people don't know. They just live with it because they
figure that's the way it's supposed to be. White people are going
to have to start taking it more seriously, too,'' Frison said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to start by at least talking about it,'' he said.

JACK M. CAMPBELL, FORMER GOVERNOR OF NEW MEXICO, DIES AT 82 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jack M. Campbell, a former governor of New Mexico, died on
Monday in a retirement home in Santa Fe, N.M. He was 82.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, a Democrat, served two terms as governor from 1963 to
1967 and four terms in the State House of Representatives,
including two years as speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Remembered for improving services for the mentally ill and
reducing partisan politics in filling state jobs, Campbell also
appointed the state's first science adviser, reflecting his
interest in science and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, after Campbell left office, he headed the Federation of
Rocky Mountain States, which used satellites to expand education in
rural areas. He later received a public service award from the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration for using space
technology to solve problems on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell also served on the Federal Atomic Safety and Licensing
Board from 1967 to 1972, and, in 1983, he helped found New Mexico
Technet, an early part of the Internet. A year later, along with
scientists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, he helped form
the Santa Fe Institute, a private research and education center.
</P>
<P>
   Born on Sept. 10, 1916, in Hutchinson, Kan., Campbell received
bachelor's and law degrees from Washburn College in Topeka, Kan. He
practiced law for a year in Albuquerque, N.M., became an FBI agent
for a year and then joined the Marines in 1942. After the war, he
returned to practicing law in Albuquerque, Roswell and Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
   He was elected to the State House of Representatives in 1955,
and governor in 1962, defeating the incumbent, Edwin L. Mechem, a
Republican. Two years later, Campbell became the first governor in
the state in 12 years to win re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell is survived by two sons, Michael and John Terry, both
of Albuquerque; two daughters, Patricia Bobb of Chicago and
Kathleen Campbell of Santa Fe, and three granddaughters. &QL;

   Hard core. This is hard core.
</P>
<P>
   We're trying to crack the bonehard core
</P>
<P>
   Of an obscene, abominable past
</P>
<P>
   And it's worse than surgery.

</P>
<P>
   -- from ``Hard Core,'' by Ann Neel
</P>
<P>
   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. -- Ann Neel and Pam Smith had come too far
to turn back. They had already discovered that their research into
family history in central Missouri would be no pleasant trip down
memory lane.
</P>
<P>
   Their families had been on opposite sides of a huge racial
divide.
</P>
<P>
   Neel had found the inventory of her
great-great-great-grandfather's belongings. Spinning wheels.
Heifers. And several black men and women.
</P>
<P>
   Smith had found records that showed her great-great-grandfather
was sold on the courthouse steps in Howard County in 1854.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, starting in 1991, they talked three times
a week on the phone, sharing their latest discoveries of Missouri
history.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their different histories, they became friends. They
shared a passion for exploring their pasts -- and how it shaped
them.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, Smith finally tracked down the owner of Baltimore
Robinson, her great-great-grandfather. She showed the document to
Cecy Rice, president of the Randolph County Historical Society.
</P>
<P>
   Rice recognized the slave owner's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, that's one of Ann's,'' Rice said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith didn't know what she meant. Then it became clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you saying Ann's family owned my family?''
</P>
<P>
   Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Smith could barely talk. She raced back to her hotel in Moberly
and called Neel in Seattle. Smith didn't even say hello.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your family owned my family,'' she blurted.
</P>
<P>
   Neel was equally dismayed. They exchanged regrets. They hung up.
</P>
<P>
   Smith called another friend. She barely remembers the call now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm never going to speak to her again,'' Smith told her.
</P>
<P>
   I am not amused by pain
</P>
<P>
   I want to ball you up
</P>
<P>
   like a messed up piece of paper
</P>
<P>
   and throw you out of my life.
</P>
<P>
   Can you believe that?
</P>
<P>
   And can you be that --
</P>
<P>
   a piece of garbage
</P>
<P>
   like your ancestors might have treated mine?
</P>
<P>
   -- from ``Wasteland,'' by Pam Smith
Genealogical sleuthing
</P>
<P>
   The legacy of slavery didn't leave Missouri untouched.
</P>
<P>
   The Dred Scott decision, which determined that slaves were not
citizens, started from a case in St. Louis. Abolitionist John Brown
launched bloody raids into the Show-Me state. Some of the Civil
War's most significant battles took place in Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Neel, a professor at the University of Puget Sound near Seattle,
knew this when she returned to Missouri in 1981 to research her
genealogy.
</P>
<P>
   She often assigned family research to her students, but she also
wanted to learn about her own roots. Her most startling discovery
was that her great-great-great-grandfather, Thomas Jackson, was a
slave owner.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, a communications consultant from Chicago, became
interested in genealogy in 1990 after seeing the television series
``Queen,'' a follow-up to Alex Haley's ``Roots.''
</P>
<P>
   Area researchers pointed Smith to Neel, who eagerly shared
advice.
</P>
<P>
   Sifting through documents in Moberly, Smith found the paper
trail to Baltimore Robinson, her great-great-grandfather. She began
connecting the dots to his owner.
</P>
<P>
   From the 1870 census -- the first after the Civil War -- Smith
learned Baltimore Robinson's age. That was important, because slave
owners' inventories only listed the ages and genders of slaves, not
their names.
</P>
<P>
   She found his owner by correctly guessing that, like many
slaves, he took his owner's last name. In Philip Robinson's slave
schedule, she found a black man who matched Baltimore's age.
</P>
<P>
   It all was going smoothly until she learned of Neel's
connection. Philip Robinson was Thomas Jackson's brother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Now what?
</P>
<P>
   Neel was mortified. Smith was hurt. But the deepest emotions
wouldn't come until later. Both decided to ignore the initial pain
and push forward.
</P>
<P>
   Smith didn't follow through with her vow not to talk to Neel.
They began speaking on the phone, but their friendship had cooled.
</P>
<P>
   Neel finally invited Smith to visit her in Washington. Their
first meeting was awkward, but they began talking. They bared their
feelings for three hours, a conversation Neel recorded and
transcribed.
</P>
<P>
   Their frankest exchanges have always come through poetry they
exchange. The dialogue started with Smith's ``Wasteland,'' which
spawned Neel's ``Hard Core.'' In the written word, they have shared
anger, guilt and fear.
</P>
<P>
   But they agreed on one important point.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided that we really needed to do something about the
connection. It seemed almost cosmic that this happened,'' Neel
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always ask me if I apologized to Pam,'' she added. ``I
didn't apologize to her because I didn't personally do it. But I
took responsibility for it. I can't change what they did. But I can
try to do something to make amends or give something back to making
it better.''
</P>
<P>
   If I had to answer for all my father's sins
</P>
<P>
   I would be in hell --
</P>
<P>
   Precisely where this tunnel seems to lead.
</P>
<P>
   Am I willing to stay this righteous path?
</P>
<P>
   Yes.
</P>
<P>
   -- from ``Hard Core'' by Neel
Anger into action
</P>
<P>
   This summer, Neel and Smith will present 10 talks throughout
Missouri, part of a series called ``Entangled Lives: Facing Our
Slaveholding Past.''
</P>
<P>
   They will speak in St. Joseph on July 24 and at the University
of Missouri-Kansas City on July 25. Springfield is using their July
15 presentation to launch a citywide project on race relations.
</P>
<P>
   Other sites are Macon, St. Louis, Fayette and Sedalia.
</P>
<P>
   At their first presentation, last week in Jefferson City, Neel
and Smith showed slides of their families' journey through slavery,
segregation and racial understanding.
</P>
<P>
   They don't gloss over their own struggles to stay friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people relate to us because we've had our own share of
struggles and conflict. We're no different than a lot of the people
we're talking to,'' Smith said. ``The difference is we are
committed to barreling through.''
</P>
<P>
   And they do.
</P>
<P>
   Both women have faced resistance from their own loved ones.
Smith said her friends don't understand why she wants anything to
do with Neel. Neel said her family is upset that she is making
their history so public.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, the resistance is part of their own blood. Both say
their fathers had little love for people of other races.
</P>
<P>
   But they hope to see the fruits of their discussions.
</P>
<P>
   Before each presentation, they ask city residents about what
specific issues are relevant. In nearby Moberly, for example, many
black and white residents are upset about a recent Ku Klux Klan
recruiting drive.
</P>
<P>
   In another presentation outside Missouri, a white audience
member confided to Smith that he used to fear black people. She was
glad he told her.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what happens when people are not afraid to penetrate
the surface, to understand the differences,'' Smith said. ``Once
that dialogue starts, it allows healing to take place.''
</P>
<P>
   Neel added: ``On the deepest level, it's letting people see that
it's possible to have honest communication. It doesn't mean that
it's going to be happily ever after.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith compares their experience to climbing a mountain. She had
climbed Mount Kilimanjaro on a trip to research slave history in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The women know it would be much safer to stay at base camp and
not strive for more. By aiming higher, they risk it all. But the
reward might be greater than they can imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Smith writes about their quest in the final passage of
``Wasteland.''
</P>
<P>
   To every person, their conscience
</P>
<P>
   For every moment,
</P>
<P>
   an opportunity lush with hope.
</P>
<P>
   Like Kilimanjaro on a rainy day
</P>
<P>
   through the mud, over the danger zones,
</P>
<P>
   on toward the summit...

A CARD, A CALL AND TEENS CAN GET SAFE RIDE HOME AFTER PARTYING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TRACY JOHNSON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISSAQUAH, Wash. _ Issaquah District Court Judge Mary Ann
Ottinger sees a parade of grim-faced teenagers in court trying to
explain the drunken-driving charges against them.
</P>
<P>
   Many face stiff fines, or loss of their license, or the wrath of
their parents. Some are lucky to be alive, Ottinger says, after
spinning off the road in a beer-clouded haze or barreling into a
tree.
</P>
<P>
   And far too many claim they drove because they ``had to get
home.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a poor excuse, and it has even less weight now that the
judge and some of her friends are offering to do the driving.
</P>
<P>
   Her Safe Rides program has put cards in the hands of roughly
1,000 Skyline High School students in Issaquah, a suburb of Seattle
across Lake Washington. The cards list telephone numbers for adults
promising to be on-call, confidential chauffeurs.
</P>
<P>
   Ottinger said she doesn't want students to feel they must decide
between weaving their way home or calling their parents, because
many are much more afraid to do the latter. And taxis aren't easy
to find in the suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to provide them with another option,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ottinger and the eight volunteers _ one a Skyline secretary, the
rest parents of students _ want the kids to know they won't rat
them out to their parents. Nor will they lecture young passengers
about alcohol or drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The cards themselves read ``no questions asked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole point is just to get these kids home if they made a
mis-take,'' said volunteer Jane Stoeklin.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers say they haven't yet received any calls, but they're
ready for this weekend's keg-party potential. Skyline seniors
graduate Friday. Everyone else will be sprung for the summer next
week.
</P>
<P>
   Danielle Knight, an 18-year-old graduating Friday, keeps the
card tucked in her backpack. She says her parents would happily
pick her up from a party if she needed them, but she's seen plenty
of other kids stagger to their cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens every weekend. Everybody drinks and drives _ it's
pretty scary,'' she said. Teens ``are going to drink no matter
what, but if you can prevent them from driving, you might save a
life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a good idea,'' agreed Chris Jenkins, a junior.
``I hope a lot of people will use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Others didn't think they needed help _ they would just spend the
night or hop in a car anyway because, as one boy put it, ``I trust
my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   But recent tragedies east of Lake Sammamish have made parents
particularly wary. On the Sammamish Plateau last month, 19-year-old
Ryan Scott Wilson died in a wreck in which, police say, the driver
had been drinking. About 18 months earlier, 17-year-old Guy Kelly
was killed when his car slammed into a tree after a party.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have so little experience in driving by itself, that when
you add alcohol to it, it's frightening,'' said Mary Weeks, who
eagerly volunteered to join Safe Rides.
</P>
<P>
   Before starting the program, Ottinger talked over the idea with
her sons, both teens at Skyline, and their friends.
</P>
<P>
   They told her they might use it, and that they'd be more likely
to call if they were assured their parents wouldn't find out.
</P>
<P>
   And if their friends' parents were listed on the card, well,
they'd definitely call someone else. The confidentiality of
strangers seemed to be the key, Ottinger said.
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't sure if they'd be leery about calling a judge, though
she pledges the same secrecy she asks from volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   The idea hit Ottinger last year, when she visited a high school
and overheard hallway chatter about the previous weekend's drunken
bash. She heard one boy telling his buddies he was sloshed when he
climbed into his car, and she cringed to hear why he decided to
drive anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no choice. I had to get home. I had to drive,'' Ottinger
heard him explain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to reach out and say, `Why didn't you call
me?''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And now he can.

PROGRESS AT KANSAS CITY SCHOOLS IS UNEVEN, REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PHILLIP O'CONNOR and TANIKA WHITE  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- The Kansas City School District is making
uneven progress in improving classroom instruction, according to a
new report.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Gouwens, an assistant professor of education at Roosevelt
University in Chicago, also found problems with the district's
efforts to train teachers in the 12 schools she visited this
spring.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur A. Benson II, attorney for the plaintiff children in the
district's desegregation case, has commissioned Gouwens for several
years to tour schools and issue the report.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Chase, the district's interim chief administrator for
curriculum and instruction, said Thursday she had not seen the
report but wasn't surprised by the findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like everyone to make a quantum leap, but it's unrealistic
to believe everyone is going to progress at the same time and on
the same level,'' Chase said. ``It's our job as administrators to
continue delivering the information and training until everyone is
functioning at a high level.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the report focused on efforts to improve instruction,
raise academic performance and implement a core curriculum.
</P>
<P>
   Gouwens found that some schools and teachers were making great
strides and others were doing little or nothing to change.
</P>
<P>
   Benson noted that this year's evaluation is less critical than
previous ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``It showed teachers in many cases are working a lot harder, in
many instances finding ways to overcome the academic inertia of the
district and make improvements on their own,'' Benson said. ``It
raises the question of how much faster and further we could go if
we had strong administrative support.''
</P>
<P>
   Problems remain, the report shows.
</P>
<P>
   During one visit, for example, an English teacher at Middle
School of the Arts did nothing to engage students who dozed, kept
their books closed or otherwise did not participate.
</P>
<P>
   ``When students asked if their answers were correct, the teacher
made no attempt to teach...leading the observer to wonder if the
point of the lesson was to complete the exercise or to know
something about adverb phrases,'' Gouwens wrote.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, a science teacher at the same school took a rubber
band from a student and then used it to demonstrate kinetic and
potential energy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't know you were doing something scientific, did
you?'' the teacher said.
</P>
<P>
   Benson said he was disturbed that the core curriculum, which
explains what a student should know and be able to do in each
subject at each grade level, is not in full use three years after
being approved by the school board.
</P>
<P>
   At Lincoln College Prep, for example, Gouwens reported seeing
copies of the curriculum on teachers' desks but little or no
evidence of it in their instruction.
</P>
<P>
   Some principals and teachers said large turnovers in student
population caused problems this year.
</P>
<P>
   At Southeast High School, for example, only 75 of this year's
1,275 students attended the school the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   At Rogers Middle School, Principal Sally Newell said the change
from a magnet to a neighborhood school brought many challenges,
including lower attendance, less parent involvement, more problems
with drugs, larger class sizes and more staff turnover.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Newell said ``Without the drawing card of our
magnet theme, it's going to be real important to continue to find
ways to build community with our students and parents.... It may
involve us getting a lot more active in the life of the
neighborhood.''

THIRD CHIMP BORN AT L.A. ZOO AS KEEPERS PUZZLE OVER PATERNITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LEE CONDON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The chimpanzees at the Los Angeles Zoo made
monkeys out of the keepers again, as a third surprise pregnancy
yielded another baby Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, zoo keepers don't know the identity of the father,
but they insist the Casanova isn't going to remain anonymous for
long.
</P>
<P>
   On the same day the new 4-pound male arrived, officials shipped
off blood and tissue samples from all male chimpanzees in the
exhibit for paternity testing. They expect to know within 30 to 60
days which male or males, all of whom they thought were unable to
reproduce, impregnated three female chimpanzees within the last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a couple of months before we know who the father
is,'' said Manuel Mollinedo, director of the zoo. ``Obviously chimp
parentage isn't a high priority at these DNA labs.''
</P>
<P>
   All six of the exhibit's male chimpanzees in breeding age have
had vasectomies.
</P>
<P>
   The latest addition to the zoo was born to 15-year-old Regina at
the Chimpanzees of Mahale Mountains exhibit. The healthy infant was
placed in a nursery, where it will be hand-raised by zoo keepers,
along with another 6-week-old chimp named Jean.
</P>
<P>
   The new baby is being fed infant formula and was given a plush
toy chimpanzee that was rubbed on its mother for her scent to help
him adjust to the transition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The newborn is doing very well considering that he is only a
couple of days old,'' said Jenny McNary, curator of mammals. ``His
presence in the nursery will be wonderful for Jean who now has a
companion.''
</P>
<P>
   Zoo officials have not named the baby, but plan on announcing a
name contest within the next several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to remove the babies from the 13-member troop was
made because of the death of another infant and a threat to baby
Jean. Last month a 4-month-old baby chimpanzee, Toshi, died in the
exhibit after young male chimps fatally injured her while
roughhousing.
</P>
<P>
   Jean was removed after young male chimpanzees snatched the baby
from its mother, Gracie, and Jerrard, a 9-year-old chimp, grabbed
the baby from the other juvenile males in an apparent power play.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo keepers considered segregating Gracie and her baby from the
other chimps but decided that would both cause a rift in the
chimpanzee troop and cause Gracie great distress.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the baby chimps will make daily visits to the main
exhibit. After 18 months, zoo staff will evaluate whether the
chimps should move into the exhibit permanently.
</P>
<P>
   Mollinedo said the troop was in the midst of a power play of
sorts. The upstart Jerrard has been maneuvering to take control of
the group from Judeo, 22. Prior to the chaos of the last year, the
zoo's chimp family had raised seven infant chimps since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   The paternity debacle started with the birth of Toshi.

DODGERS WALKING THE PLANK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Just wait. Sometimes it'll take an inning, maybe
two, and other times it happens late in the game.
</P>
<P>
   But, inevitably, something will go wrong, almost as if the
Dodgers are waiting for it.
</P>
<P>
   For Chan Ho Park and the Dodgers, that time arrived in a
decisive five-run seventh inning in which mental errors combined
with the physical. It enabled the Pittsburgh Pirates to win the
finale of the three-game series 8-3 Thursday night at Dodger
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It dropped the Dodgers (30-34) to 4-10 in June. They haven't won
back-to-back games since June 4-5 and have lost five of six to the
Pirates this season. The Dodgers have also lost eight of 10 and 11
of 15. And Kevin Brown remains the only Dodgers starter to win this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Pirates outfielder Brant Brown hit a pair of solo homers off
Park. It was his first multi-homer game of the season; three of
those five homers came during this three-game series. Brown was
also walked intentionally, hit by a pitch with the bases loaded and
popped to third in the ninth in his bid for his third homer.
</P>
<P>
   Pirates leadoff hitter Al Martin had three hits, walked twice
and was a homer shy of hitting for the cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing was that good for the Dodgers. Park (4-4) allowed seven
runs on 11 hits in 61/3 innings. He struck out seven but walked
four in throwing 112 pitches. By contrast, Pirates starter Kris
Benson (4-6) allowed three runs _ one earned _ in 61/3 innings and
didn't walk a batter.
</P>
<P>
   The five-run seventh also turned a solid Park outing into
another abysmal one. Park returned from a seven-game suspension
(punishment for punching and kicking the Angels' Tim Belcher during
a fight) to pitch six strong innings, only to have the effort
evaporate in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's homers in the third and fifth gave the Pirates a 2-1
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game Park said he felt refreshed and strong after the
layoff, then had his troubles in the seventh. And a poor decision
by rookie catcher Angel Pena didn't help.
</P>
<P>
   Pirates starter Kris Benson began the inning with a single to
right. Martin walked and Ed Sprague sacrificed the runners over.
But Pena threw to third to try and get Benson, who slid in safe.
Brian Giles then doubled in a pair of runs to give the Pirates a
4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Park struck out Kevin Young, but another run scored on Jason
Kendall's infield single to third. Park walked Warren Morris to
load the bases before being replaced by Doug Bochtler.
</P>
<P>
   But for the third time in four games a Dodgers pitcher hit a
batter to force in a run. Jamie Arnold did it twice Wednesday, and
Bochtler joined the club when he hit Brown as the Pirates went
ahead 6-1. Abraham Nunez's fielder's choice made it 7-1.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers cut the lead to 7-3 in the bottom of the inning with
RBI doubles from Eric Karros and Devon White.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates, a ballclub built on doing the little things, added
a run in the eighth by doing just that. Martin led off with a
double, moved to third on a short fly ball in foul territory and
scored on a perfect squeeze bunt by Adrian Brown to go ahead 8-3.
It was wonderful execution of what the Dodgers tried to do earlier
in the game, only to have Park bunt the ball foul.

FEDERAL AGENCY ORDERS PART OF PIPELINE INVOLVED IN ACCIDENT
CLOSED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT SUNDE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELLINGHAM, Wash. _ Federal regulators worried about the safety
of the Olympic pipeline are ordering the company that operates it
to keep the northern end of the 400-mile line closed and run some
other segments with less fuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't reopen it until we're satisfied of the safety of
reopening it,'' said Kelley Coyner, administrator of the U.S.
Transportation Department's Research and Special Programs
Administration. That branch of the DOT is responsible for
regulating pipelines.
</P>
<P>
   The order will compel Olympic Pipe Line Co., whose pipeline
ruptured and then caused a deadly fire in Bellingham last week, to
make safety improvements on the line, including installing new
valves; to double check the computer that operates it; and to
inspect the pipe. Officials emphasized that the safety improvements
are needed but are not necessarily an indication of what caused the
rupture.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is totally expected, and these are areas that we are
looking at,'' said Joann Hamick, a spokeswoman for Renton-based
Olympic Pipe Line. ``We planned to test everything and do
everything that needs to be done to make sure it's safe before we
are operating. We would do that regardless (of federal orders).''
</P>
<P>
   The rupture and fire cut off two refineries from the pipeline,
leaving it with only two other supplying refineries in Anacortes.
</P>
<P>
   That has left the pipeline operating at 45 percent of its daily
14 million-gallon capacity. Already, refineries are using more
barges to ship fuel to customers and may increase such shipments,
depending on how much regulators order pressure in the pipeline to
be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic had no record of violations with federal regulators
until its 16-inch pipeline ruptured into Bellingham's Whatcom Creek
last week, spilling about 277,000 gallons of fuel into the creek.
Gasoline vapor ignited, creating a fireball that killed two boys. A
teenager also died after being overcome by fumes and drowning.
Bellingham officials said Thursday that they believe the two boys
ignited the fire as they played with a butane fireplace lighter.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers were working late into the night in Washington, D.C.,
Thursday putting the final touches on the Transportation
Department's order. It was expected to be sent by overnight mail to
Olympic Pipe Line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are making sure we are confident of the integrity of the
line,'' Coyner said. ``We're making sure it's safe.''
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Department's order will keep closed the upper
37 miles of the pipeline. That section carries gasoline, diesel
fuel and jet fuel from refineries at Cherry Point and Ferndale,
through Bellingham, and on south to Allen in Skagit County.
</P>
<P>
   At Allen, a pipeline from the west brings petroleum products
from the two refineries in Anacortes to the main line. The pipeline
will continue to operate with fuel from those two refineries, but
at reduced pressure in at least some sections, Transportation
Department spokeswoman Patricia Klinger said.
</P>
<P>
   That will likely reduce the amount of fuel heading south to
Seattle and Portland. About 60 percent is gasoline, but the line
also supplies Sea-Tac Airport, which uses about 1.5 million gallons
of jet fuel every day. The pipeline also supplies Portland's
airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're worried about the integrity of the line, but Seattle
also has a need for the product,'' Klinger said.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Department's action against Olympic has not
been used often. It took similar action earlier this decade against
the Colonial Pipeline Co., which operates more than 5,000 miles of
pipeline from Texas to New York. Colonial had major spills in 1991
in South Carolina and 1993 in Virginia, prompting the National
Transportation Safety Board to issue a special report on pipeline
safety and federal oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a pretty serious order,'' Coyner said of the action
against Olympic. ``I would say we do a fairly small number of
these.''
</P>
<P>
   Klinger said the Transportation Department took the action
because regulators worried that Olympic would soon return to normal
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to put replacement pipe back in and start up,,'
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-mile section has been closed since the June 10explosion
and would have likely remained closed perhaps into July. The
damaged section of pipe hasn't been removed.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said Thursday that job may take two weeks. Among other
things, a water line nearby must be moved before the damaged
pipeline can be dug up.
</P>
<P>
   Klinger said the order that will be delivered Friday will impose
several requirements on Olympic for the first section of the
pipeline:
</P>
<P>
   _Make sure the computer system that controls, monitors and
detects leaks on the pipeline is operating properly. The company
will have to perform an in-depth analysis of the system, known as
SCADA for supervisory control and data acquisition. Olympic's
computer system crashed about an hour, then a backup system crashed
before the first reports of a leak in Bellingham.
</P>
<P>
   _Test all block valves, which can stop the flow of fuel, in
populated and environmentally sensitive areas and correct any
problems.
</P>
<P>
   _Determine whether more block valves _ which stop the flow of
fuel in the pipeline _ are needed and produce a schedule for their
installation.
</P>
<P>
   _Install an additional check valve near the water treatment
plant in Bellingham; the rupture occurred near the treatment plant.
A check valve operates something like a pet door. It is open as
fuel passes through the pipeline, but closes without any fuel. It
closes automatically, keeping fuel from backwashing.
</P>
<P>
   _Make sure any plan for corrective action on the 34-year-old
pipeline includes a way to deal with corrosion.
</P>
<P>
   _Internally inspect the line for corrosion and pressure-test the
line.
</P>
<P>
   Coyner said she couldn't estimate how long it would take to make
the safety improvements. But she said her agency could order more
actions by Olympic, especially after the ruptured section of pipe
is removed, then analyzed for corrosion and other problems.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to federal regulators, the state of Washington will
take a close look at pipeline safety.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gary Locke, who toured the site of the blast in Bellingham
Thursday, said he will set up a team to look at ways to prevent
accidents like the Olympic spill and to improve response to such
emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   The team will look to see whether gaps exist between federal and
state regulation of pipelines, whether local police and fire
departments need to update response plans and whether regional
command teams should be set up to respond to pipeline spills.
</P>
<P>
   The team will include the state fire marshal, representatives
from local jurisdictions and officials from the state's Emergency
Management Division, Transportation and Utilities Commission and
the Ecology Department.
</P>
<P>
   Locke himself also has a major role in regulating pipelines. He
will have the final say on whether Olympic will be allowed to build
a 231-mile pipeline across the Cascades from near Woodinville to
Pasco.
</P>
<P>
   Locke would not discuss Thursday how he is likely to decide on
the cross-Cascades pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed pipeline would go through Snoqualmie, North Bend,
Kittitas and Pasco.

ADVERTISING: MICROSOFT DROPS WIEDEN &AMP; KENNEDY FOR McCANN-ERICKSON 
 (rk) 
 By   STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A five-year relationship between the Microsoft Corp. and Wieden
&AMP; Kennedy in Portland, Ore., ended abruptly Thursday, as Microsoft
dismissed the agency and shifted its corporate brand account, with
billings estimated at $100 million, to McCann-Erickson Worldwide
Advertising, a newcomer to the company's roster.
</P>
<P>
   Wieden &AMP; Kennedy, best known for its clever campaigns for Nike
Inc., had once been Microsoft's principal American agency. It
created Microsoft's first brand campaigns, image-polishing ads that
appeared on television, in print and on the Internet carrying the
theme ``Where do you want to go to today?''
</P>
<P>
   But after a partnership with Wieden &AMP; Kennedy that at times
turned turbulent, Microsoft clearly concluded that it was time to
go.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough decision,'' Robert J. Herbold, executive vice
president and chief operating officer at Microsoft in Redmond,
Wash., said in a telephone interview. ``We've had to make a very
difficult choice between two world-class agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   The shift, effective immediately, was described as a mutual
parting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft is a unique company,'' Dan Wieden, president and
chief creative officer at Wieden &AMP; Kennedy, said in a statement.
``Our relationship has been intense, filled with highs and lows,
but it has run its course.''
</P>
<P>
   The change is emblematic of the spate of rapid account changes
that has rocked Madison Avenue recently. One week last month, for
instance, accounts with billings estimated at $600 million left
their old agencies for new ones.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft move, which consolidates Microsoft's corporate and
product advertising at offices of McCann-Erickson, deprives Wieden
&AMP; Kennedy of one of its largest clients. The agency's worldwide
billings last year were estimated at $790 million; besides Nike,
other big clients include Coca-Cola Co. and the Miller Brewing Co.
unit of Philip Morris Cos.
</P>
<P>
   But the loss has wider implications for Wieden &AMP; Kennedy because
Microsoft _ even with all its antitrust and other problems _ is a
prestigious client in a red-hot marketing category, technology.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the trade publication Adweek reported that Wieden had
told agency colleagues during one of their perpetual struggles on
the Nike account that Microsoft represented the agency's future.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Microsoft loss was foreshadowed when in April the
company withdrew the assignment as agency of record for the Windows
operating system in the United States from Wieden &AMP; Kennedy, which
helped introduce the two previous versions, Windows 95 and Windows
98.
</P>
<P>
   The next shoe dropped May 27, when Microsoft named
McCann-Erickson to handle American duties for Windows after a
review. Spending has not been determined pending plans to introduce
Windows 2000, but trade publications estimated the budget at $50
million to $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would be at a disadvantage to have two agencies trying to
do two different things,'' Herbold said, referring to Wieden &AMP;
Kennedy's handling of brand campaigns and McCann-Erickson's
handling of product campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if it was not common practice among many advertisers
to divide image and product accounts between two agencies, Herbold
replied: ``You don't want to confuse consumers as to what Microsoft
is. If one campaign is more in depth about our trademark and one
campaign is more in depth about specific business solutions and
products, that's hard to do with two agencies. That was the dilemma
we faced.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had no dissatisfaction with the work on the corporate
image effort'' by Wieden &AMP; Kennedy, Herbold said. ``The work
running now is probably the best we've ever produced.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``in recent weeks, as we've been evaluating our plans for
television advertising for fiscal year '00, which begins in July
1999,'' he added, ``it became clear that moving to a unified
advertising strategy with a single agency would best address our
overall marketing needs.''
</P>
<P>
   Herbold said that he had discussed the decision with Wieden
``over the course of this week.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Wieden said Wieden &AMP; Kennedy would not dismiss the
employees who have worked on the Microsoft account. ``Wieden &AMP;
Kennedy has built a uniquely talented technology team,'' he said.
``Due to the growth in this category and the success in creating
such an experienced group, the agency will keep the team intact for
new business opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   To land the Windows assignment last month, McCann-Erickson
teamed up with a sibling agency under the Interpublic Group of
Cos.' umbrella, Anderson &AMP; Lembke in San Francisco, which had
handled other tasks for Microsoft. McCann-Erickson merged its San
Francisco office with Anderson &AMP; Lembke last week to form an agency
named McCann-Erickson/A&AMP;L.
</P>
<P>
   The New York and Seattle offices of McCann-Erickson, which are
collaborating with McCann-Erickson/A&AMP;L on the Windows work, will
also pitch in on the new Microsoft corporate brand assignment, said
John J. Dooner Jr., chairman and chief executive at McCann-Erickson
in New York, a unit of McCann-Erickson World Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't anticipate this,'' Dooner said in a telephone
interview, referring to the consolidation. ``We're excited and
thrilled.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what changes McCann-Erickson might make to Wieden &AMP;
Kennedy's ads, Dooner said: ``We'll be making an assessment of what
needs to be revised or modified. We will respect what exists that's
working.''
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft corporate account is the most recent in a lengthy
list of gains by McCann-Erickson; others include DuPont, Gateway, a
company to be spun off from Hewlett-Packard, Lowe's and Sprint.

AVRE GROWS UP FAST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM BARRERO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CULVER CITY -- Patience Avre is a mere 23 years old, but by
Sunday evening she will be a veteran of her second World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   The Nigerian forward is making a name for herself on a team
whose most recognizable figure is veteran forward Mercy Akide,
nicknamed ``Marvelous'' Mercy for her on-field exploits.
</P>
<P>
   Avre, who has played with Akide since 1995 on the national team,
has learned plenty from her, but it doesn't stop there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learn a lot from her,'' said Avre, who sports streaks of
magenta in her hair, ``but she learns a lot from me. We all learn a
lot from each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Nigeria is out to prove it is more than a one-woman
team, although that portrayal has more to do with certain media
perceptions than an actual feeling within the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``With what I saw in the practice this morning, there are so
many weapons on this team, from the goalkeeper to the (11th player
on the field),'' said Julius Ujeh, one of the team's media liasons.
``If any team is going to just concentrate on Mercy Akide, they got
another thing coming.''

A CRITICAL VIEW _ EVERYTHING'S FINE 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The easiest thing you could do Friday morning is rip
the Red Sox for what they did Thursday night. In fact, I think it
would be the perfect antidote to road rage. Instead of releasing
your frustrations on fellow drivers in gridlocked traffic, you
should first vent about the Sox. It can be done in less than 30
seconds. And you'll feel better, too.
</P>
<P>
   You could start with Pat Rapp. He gave up four runs in the first
inning and seven in three-plus innings of work. Afterward, he
explained his eventual 8-7 loss to the Twins by saying, ``They just
hit the holes.'' He also added, ``They just put the bat on the
ball.'' Also: ``Four quick ones is hard to rebound from. We did and
I just kept letting them get more.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks, Pat.
</P>
<P>
   Or you could talk about the way Jose Offerman dunked the ball.
Second basemen aren't supposed to dunk. But that's what Offerman
did in the fourth inning. He tried to make a relay throw and wound
up throwing the ball into the grass. It traveled about 7 feet.
Offerman said the ball simply slipped out of his hand. It was such
a horrific play that Pedro Martinez must have been hiding from the
official scorer rather than flashing him with the choke sign.
</P>
<P>
   Offerman's basketball play was far less glamorous than that of
Twins left fielder Jacque Jones, who tried to avoid the tag by
leaping over Jason Varitek and grazing the plate. Jones missed, so
he then tried to juke Varitek and touch the plate. He missed again.
</P>
<P>
   Believe me, shredding the Sox is easy. But I won't do that.
Actually, I'm here to tell you how good they look. I'm here to tell
you that, in the next couple weeks, they could easily distance
themselves from their wild-card competitors. And, yes, I'm even
here to say that I'm not so sure that everyone should be conceding
the American League East to the Yankees; the Sox just might win it.
</P>
<P>
   Before I get to that, may I request 30 more seconds of road rage
prevention? The Sox had Trot Nixon on third base with no one out in
the eighth. They trailed by a run. They had Offerman, John
Valentin, and Nomar Garciaparra coming up. Offerman lined out.
Valentin and Garciaparra struck out. No runs. Jimy Williams would
say later that he saw ``cows jumping over the moon.''
</P>
<P>
   But you know why I like the Sox? They know how to slump. Less
than two weeks ago, they began a stretch in which they lost 7 of 8.
Their closer, Tom Gordon, had a saves streak snapped at 54. One of
their starting pitchers, Bret Saberhagen, went on the disabled list
because he cut his foot with glass at a party (imagine if he had
decided to walk over burning coals). They released a local
reliever, Jim Corsi, and asked him to join the front office. And
they recalled a local infielder, Lou Merloni, after he had asked
the team to trade him because he didn't foresee the team recalling
him.
</P>
<P>
   After all of that chaos and turnover, take a look at the
standings. The Sox trail the Yankees by a half game. That's it. A
half game. They started Rapp, one of their least reliable pitchers,
Thursday &UR;  &LR; night and still could have swept the Twins if someone had
stepped up in the eighth. And just in case you are concerned about
Rapp, Ramon Martinez (a 123-game winner who has never had an ERA
above 4) is gradually making his way toward the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Some of you still want to vent, right? But before you get too
engaged in that, there is also the issue of the schedule. Of the
Sox' next 20 games, 16 are against the Orioles, White Sox and Devil
Rays. The only interesting thing about Tampa Bay is watching Jose
Canseco hit home runs. But the Sox can easily squash the hopes of
Baltimore and Chicago by doing what they did to the Twins: taking
three out of four.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, they won't win much if they continue to play like
they did Thursday night. You can usually look at the Sox and say,
``Now there's a team that reflects its manager.'' Solid. Measured.
Not much flash. But they looked a little ragged Thursday &UR;  &LR; night.
Williams was asked if that was atypical of his team. ``Not sure
what that means,'' he said. Later, someone asked him if it was
ironic that his team, usually desperate for runs, scored more than
five runs and lost. ``I don't know about irony,'' he said. ``Is
that atypical?''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone got a laugh out of that one and eventually moved out of
Williams's office. The manager won't look ahead, but he knows there
isn't too much to fear in the AL. His team has already played well
against the Indians and Yankees, two division leaders. This
weekend, it gets the Rangers. What exactly is there to fear? We are
heading toward the All-Star break and the New Yorkers still haven't
soared away as most people expected.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest thing to do this morning? Praise the Sox. But let's
get back to that rage thing. Hey, Dan Duquette. What's up, man?
When are you going to trade for a power hitter?

AL GORE, REP. NORM DICKS HAVE FORGED LASTING FRIENDSHIP OVER THE
YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON AND JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Norm Dicks, the gruff linebacker from Bremerton,
Wash., and Al Gore, the smooth-talking newsman from Carthage,
Tenn., were rivals when they first met because they had something
in common: they were the two best-connected members of Congress'
1976 freshman class.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore and Dicks quickly became personal friends and political
allies. They will be together in Seattle on Friday as Gore touches
down on the last stop of a tour launching his campaign for the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign Chairman Tony Coelho describes Washington as a
``critical'' state on Gore's path to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In a business where friendships get strained in the quest for
power, and sometimes are broken by disagreements of principle, Gore
and Dicks have forged a lasting relationship important to both men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Norm is one of my very closest friends in the Congress, and he
and (wife) Suzie have been close friends to Tipper and me for
almost a quarter century,'' Gore said in a telephone interview
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It began with a competition between two House rookies eager to
win a seat on the money-dispensing House Appropriations Committee.
Gore could be seen walking the corridors of the Capitol with his
biggest asset in tow _ his father, former three-term Sen. Albert
Gore Sr., D-Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   But Dicks was no novice to Capitol infighting and had his own
patrons _ former boss, Sen. Warren Magnuson, and two powerful
colleagues, Rules Committee member Lloyd Meeds and House
Agriculture Committee Chairman Tom Foley, all Washington Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Dicks recognized that the affable Gore was more popular among
the freshman class, but he successfully persuaded his fellow
freshmen not to choose among themselves but to let the committee
assignment be made by the old bulls of the House leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Now, more than two decades later, Dicks still sits in that seat
on his beloved Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Dicks says jokingly that he deserves credit for the vice
president's subsequent success: Gore wound up on the Commerce
Committee, where he managed to garner tremendous publicity from a
series of hearings and launched himself into the Senate. Gore
agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within a few days of that competition, we were competing
against each other on the basketball court, and competing on the
same team (in Congress) and we became close friends,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a similar sense of humor, we both laugh a lot together
and we both married above ourselves,'' he added. ``We also both
remember the old days ... and we share a common set of historical
memories from that era. We can talk in a kind of a shorthand that
some others don't understand right away, because we're referring to
debates that took place 30 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has appointed Dicks as one of two congressmen trying to
rally support for the vice president in the House, and he is
looking to Dicks to help him raise money and win support around the
country, not least in Seattle, where Mayor Paul Schell has endorsed
Gore's primary rival, former Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington state is critical to our election in November of
2000, and we're also very conscious of the primary,'' Coelho said.
``Norm is very engaged in giving us the state of the state,
politically and otherwise. When I decided to do this job, Al and I
talked about his friends that we trusted, and Norm was on that list
of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Dicks, who counts himself both a fan and friend of the vice
president, also has much to gain.
</P>
<P>
   In a Gore administration, Dicks could be a contender for
director of Central Intelligence or secretary of Defense. Even if
Dicks remains in Congress, which he believes is likely, he could be
chairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee in a
Democrat-run House. Together, he and the environmentally conscious
Gore would be in a unique position to tackle the ticklish natural
resources problems of the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Congress, I enjoy my job on the Appropriations
Committee, I am not seeking anything else and, frankly, Gore is
going to need allies in the Congress,'' Dicks said. ``I'd love to
be chairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee with Al
Gore as president of the United States. We could take care of the
parks in this country, the Everglades, and do the right things in
Washington state for salmon, restoring those species up and down
the West Coast.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said it is too early to talk about what role Dicks might
play in a Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year friendship between Dicks and Gore, forged in those
first weeks as freshmen, was nurtured in the 1980s by two shared
passions: arms control and basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are similarities in personality, albeit camouflaged,''
said former Rep. Al Swift, D-Wash. ``Al Gore is a very aggressive,
very bright, on-the-move guy who has never been publicity shy. And
so is Norm. (And ) they were not your standard, knee-jerk
conservative Democrats. Al and Norm reflected a Henry Jackson-type
position, strong on defense but quite liberal on domestic policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Dicks and Gore were at the center of a group of Democrats in
Congress who supported the controversial MX missile as a lever to
get President Reagan to back away from confrontation with the
Soviet Union and to support some degree of nuclear arms control.
</P>
<P>
   The two also were among a group of competitors who bonded in the
House gym.
</P>
<P>
   Gore tells the story of how Dicks, a one-time University of
Washington linebacker, would shout ``Huskies'' each time he made a
long shot. And Dicks still marvels at a trick shot Gore had
perfected in the shooting contest called horse, in which Gore would
bounce the ball off the wall and into the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were both hard-chargers; they're a lot alike,'' said
former Gov. Mike Lowry, who served in the House with them.
</P>
<P>
   Their relationship was cemented in 1988. Dicks was one of a
handful of House members to endorse Gore in his ill-fated first
campaign for president. After it was over, Dicks helped Gore raise
money to retire his debt.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Dicks again is helping Gore in the House and in
Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Norm has just one gear, and that's full speed ahead,'' said
Rep. Bart Gordon, D-Tenn., who is co-chairing the Gore effort in
the House with Dicks. So far, the two have lined up 180 of the 211
House Democrats to support Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been the Clinton administration's point man on such
Northwest issues as helping forest communities hurt by logging
cuts. Gore is central to the administration's efforts to help the
Northwest pay for salmon conservation.
</P>
<P>
   Dicks credits Gore with helping to force a renegotiation of the
U.S.-Canada salmon treaty, and with helping to steer the coveted
November meeting of the World Trade Organization to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship hasn't meant that Dicks, who is never bashful
about demanding federal largesse for his individual and corporate
constituents, gets everything he wants.
</P>
<P>
   The administration was not particularly helpful to Dicks in his
battles to fund the B-2 bomber _ a plane Clinton now celebrates
because of its usefulness in Kosovo _ and Dicks was openly
disappointed that Gore didn't do more to help Washington cities win
empowerment zone grants, although Tacoma did get a consolation
prize of $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my 31st year as part of this delegation _ eight with
Maggie, and 23 in the House _ and we've never had an administration
that's given us the help that this administration has given us,''
Dicks said. ``Al's been there for us in everything we've asked him
to do, and he deeply cares, as we all know, about the environment,
which I think is a good issue in Washington state.''

One of Jose Lima's many pet phrases is ``Believe it!''
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Atlanta Braves didn't. In fact, they went out of their way
to disprove it in a high-spirited game that included a brushback
pitch, trash-talking and plenty of elements sure to make future
meetings worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   But that is for another day and time. Thursday belonged to the
Braves, who had their way with Lima and the Astros in an 8-5
victory before a Lima-inspired crowd of 39,477 at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   But anyone who turned out for their usual dose of Lima Time
could have left after six innings, along with Lima, who battled
through what might have been his worst outing of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was terrible,'' said Lima, who allowed a season-high seven
runs (five earned). ``I (stunk). But I'm human; I'm allowed to make
a mistake. I tip my hat to them; they got me.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss ended a three-game winning streak for Lima, who lost
for only the third time in 14 decisions.
</P>
<P>
   After losing the first game of the series, the Braves rallied to
take the next three, pushing the Astros from their perch atop the
National League in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Three days ago, the Astros had the best record in the NL. But
for now, they will have to look up to see the Braves, who tied
Arizona for the NL's best record. The Braves appear to have
regained their form after being swept at home by the lowly Orioles
before their trip to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Baltimore series was not a typical Braves performance,''
Atlanta manager Bobby Cox said. ``We knew that. We took three out
of four from a pretty good team, and we're pleased to get out of
here with three wins.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros are just as happy to see them go. Believe it.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros struck out a season-high 14 times Thursday, and they
whiffed 48 times in the four-game series. After avoiding
back-to-back double-digit strikeout performances in their first 61
games, the Astros struck out at least 10 times in each of their
four games against the Braves and hit .220 in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Lima has been the NL's best pitcher this season, but he was no
match for Atlanta's Kevin Millwood, who threatened to treat
Thursday's crowd to a historic night.
</P>
<P>
   The second-year righthander struck out seven of the first nine
batters he faced and took a perfect game into the seventh inning.
Craig Biggio broke it up with a line-drive single to center on
Millwood's first pitch of the seventh. Millwood allowed only two
hits and struck out a season-high 11 batters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pitched a great game,'' Astros interim manager Matt Galante
said. ``He had a great fastball and a pretty good slider. We're one
of the best-hitting teams in the league, so when you do that to us
you're doing something.''
</P>
<P>
   The intensity that characterized Wednesday's game spilled into
Thursday's third inning when Millwood buzzed a pitch high and tight
on Lima, who hit the ground and gazed into the Braves' dugout as he
dusted himself off and got back into the batter's box. Lima struck
out to end the inning, and he barked at Millwood all the way to the
dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they were trying to get to (Lima),'' Galante said.
``Any time you have an emotional player, you want to try to get
them out of their game.''
</P>
<P>
   It appeared to work. Lima gave up three runs in the fourth _ a
rare occurrence considering he had allowed five runs in his
previous 29 innings. The Braves batted around in the inning, which
was started by Bret Boone's sharp double to left field.
</P>
<P>
   Boone scored on a hit by Javy Lopez, who tied a career high with
four hits. Ryan Klesko had an RBI double, and after an intentional
walk to eighth-place hitter Randall Simon loaded the bases, Lima
walked Millwood on a 3-2 pitch to force in the Braves' third run of
the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't walk the pitcher,'' Lima said. ``That's a guy you
should be able to get out. That's what got to me.''
</P>
<P>
   But he clearly wasn't happy with the decision to give Simon a
free pass. It was only the fifth intentional walk the Astros have
issued this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no comment about that,'' Lima said. ``I'm not (11-3)
because I'm lucky. But I'm not the manager; that's not my decision
to make. They're (the coaches) the bosses.''
</P>
<P>
   Galante, managing his fourth game in Larry Dierker's absence,
understood Lima's frustration but defended his decision to walk
Simon with two out in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was either facing a pitcher or a regular hitter,'' Galante
said. ``We only needed one out to get out of the inning. I felt
more confident with the pitcher at the plate. With Jose's control
(1.7 walks per nine innings), the last thing I expected was a
walk.''
</P>
<P>
   Lima settled down for a perfect fifth inning but was anything
but perfect in the sixth when the Braves erupted for four more
runs. Lopez hit a solo home run, Millwood added insult to injury
with an RBI single, and Ozzie Guillen's two-run double pushed the
Braves' lead to 7-0.
</P>
<P>
   Simply making contact was a victory in itself against Millwood,
and the Astros finally won a small battle when they scored a pair
of runs in the seventh. Carl Everett drove Biggio home from third
with a fielder's-choice grounder, and Spiers scored on a wild
pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Everett's RBI double and a two-run double by Ricky Gutierrez
made things interesting in the final inning, but the Braves already
had laid claim to the victory in a game that wasn't as close as the
score indicated.

FENWAY FOLLIES: RED SOX FALL GUYS 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-TWINS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Maybe this is what John Harrington really meant when he
coined the term ``silly season.''
</P>
<P>
   In a game that should have left both dugouts bathed in blushes,
the Red Sox came up a run short in their attempt to sweep a
four-game set from the Minnesota Twins, losing, 8-7, before a
Yawkey Way gathering of 31,446 that was exposed to plenty of
tomfoolery from start to finish.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many times do you see a guy jump over a catcher?'' said
Sox manager Jimy Williams, referring to the flying leap Twins
leadoff man Jacque Jones made over Sox catcher Jason Varitek in the
fourth inning, only to miss the plate upon landing. ``I've heard of
cows jumping over the moon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some wacky things happened out there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, with a chance to tie in the eighth, failed to score
Trot Nixon from third with none out, but were given one last
pratfall to exploit in the ninth, when Twins left fielder Chad
Allen broke back, then fell on what should have been a game-ending
fly ball by Varitek.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, that was weird,'' said Varitek, who was credited with a
single but was stranded when Darren Lewis fouled out to first base
to end the game. ``But there was a lot of stuff out there, from the
first inning on.''
</P>
<P>
   Twins closer Mike Trombley, the Wilbraham native, already has
had more than his fill of Fenway strangeness _ Monday night, he was
beaten by back-to-back home runs by Lewis and Jeff Frye. It was
almost too much for him to take when Varitek's ball fell safely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking of that curse of the Bambino,'' Trombley said
as he pondered if yet another night would go the Sox' way. ``I was
wondering if it really existed.''
</P>
<P>
   Trombley had entered in the eighth, after Nixon singled, stole
second and took third on a throwing error by catcher Javier
Valentin. Bob Wells, who gave up the hit to Nixon, retired Jose
Offerman on a liner to second with the infield drawn in, before
Trombley was summoned. John Valentin, who earlier hit a three-run
home run, fanned on a full count, and after Brian Daubach walked on
a full count, Nomar Garciaparra struck out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made some great pitches,'' Garciaparra said. ``He did his
job. Yeah, (the game) was long and weird, but there's nothing for
us to hang our heads about. We came back from the road trip and won
three, and we made tonight interesting. We can't complain.''
</P>
<P>
   The nutty stuff came early and often.
</P>
<P>
   Sox starting pitcher Pat Rapp retired only one of the first
seven Twins he faced, and four of them scored.
</P>
<P>
   On Marty Cordova's single to center, Lewis wanted to throw to
second, but no one was there. Garciaparra had ended up in short
right field trying to flag down Cordova's grounder, and Offerman
had scooted over to cover first, with first baseman Daubach at the
mound to handle a throw to the plate. ``I don't really know what
happened there,'' Lewis said. ``I just threw in the direction of
the bag.''
</P>
<P>
   In the third, Daubach had a throw from Garciaparra clank off his
glove for a two-base error that led to the Twins' fifth run.
</P>
<P>
   But not to worry. Twins starter LaTroy Hawkins, winner of just
18 of 78 career starts and possessor of an 8.30 earned run average
entering Thursday &UR;  &LR; night's game, allowed four of the first Sox
batters he faced to reach base, two of them scoring. An inning
later, Hawkins surrendered a three-run home run to Valentin that
cleared the TV camera well in left-center field, 421 feet away. Sox
5, Twins 4.
</P>
<P>
   Through two innings, 25 batters already had paraded to the
plate. Amazingly, Hawkins settled down, holding the Sox scoreless
until the sixth when he gave way to Joe Mays.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, reliever Bob Wolcott's first pitch as a member of the
Red Sox was lined into the right-field corner for a two-run double
by Jones, breaking a 5-all tie in the fourth. Jones took an extra
base when second baseman Offerman inadvertently spiked his relay
throw a few feet in front of him. ``I tried to stop my throw, and I
couldn't,'' said Offerman, who was charged with an error, a
decision that didn't provoke a peep from Pedro L. Martinez. ``No
big deal. Nobody scored.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though there were no outs and the infield was playing in,
Jones set sail for the plate on Cristian Guzman's roller to
Offerman and actually vaulted over Varitek. That won him huge style
points, but failed to result in a run, as he missed home plate upon
landing and was tagged out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, first time anyone's ever done that,'' Varitek said. ``I
was surprised, because I was still reaching for the ball. If I'd
had the ball, I probably would have launched him.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolcott gave up another run in the fifth when Cordova singled
and scored on Ron Coomer's drive high off the Monster, which Troy
O'Leary played into a double, the carom bouncing over his head.
</P>
<P>
   But the Red Sox climbed back with the help of another spring
training play, when shortstop Guzman overran Valentin's popup near
the third-base box seats, the ball bouncing into the stands for a
180-foot ground-rule double. One out later, Garciaparra singled
Valentin home and after a walk and hit batsman (pinch hitter Mike
Stanley) loaded the bases, Varitek hit a sacrifice fly to make it
8-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept waiting for that little guy in the TV show to walk out
to the middle of the field and make that announcement, `You're in
the Twilight Zone,' '' Coomer said.
</P>
<P>
   Sox manager Williams was asked if the game was atypical of the
Sox season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's atypical,'' he said. ``I don't know what
atypical is.''
</P>
<P>
   Ironic, then, that the Sox scored seven runs and didn't win?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I don't know about irony,'' Williams said. ``Is that
atypical?''

MODANO ANSWERS CALL FOR STARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ On Wednesday after practice, Dallas Stars coach Ken
Hitchcock tried to talk to one of his star centers about his
performance in the Stanley Cup finals, particularly in Game 4, in
which the Buffalo Sabres had tied the series at two games each.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Modano said he wasn't in the mood for a chat with the
coach, so he headed home.
</P>
<P>
   So, when Hitchcock called him that night to insist on a talk on
the eve of Thursday &UR;  &LR; night's pivotal Game 5, Modano wasn't
surprised but he was more willing to listen.
</P>
<P>
   The result of Hitchcock's challenge resulted in Modano assisting
on both Dallas goals Thursday &UR;  &LR; night as the Stars shut out the
Sabres, 2-0, to move within one win of capturing the franchise's
first Stanley Cup. They can close out the Sabres Saturday night in
Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am able to say some things candidly and only to him that
maybe I can't say to other players,'' summed up Hitchcock of his
discussion with Modano. ``It was just a phone call of support and
getting him to think in some other direction and if he listened,
great. I mean, I think he took it to heart and he went about his
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano smiled when asked about the discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had a lot of chats throughout the time he's been here
and we've been together,'' said Modano. ``He just plain and simple
asked me what type of player I was going to be tonight, and I told
him I was going to be a player who was very involved in every
aspect of the game. I felt I got away a little bit from that in
Game 4 and really wanted mentally to be a little stronger.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano, who has turned his game from all offense to a mixture of
opportunistic scoring and responsible defense under Hitchcock,
definitely answered the bell in this one.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars and Sabres were scoreless after 20 minutes for the
third time in five games. In the second, the Stars turned up the
old Texas heat.
</P>
<P>
   Just 1:42 into it, Buffalo center Curtis Brown took an
interference penalty, setting up the Stars' power-play goal and the
only offense they would need.
</P>
<P>
   Modano, who has been playing the last three games with an
injured left wrist, skated down the right side and pulled up in the
far side of the right circle. After drawing Buffalo forward Dixon
Ward, Modano patiently fed the puck across to the left circle for
defenseman Darryl Sydor. Sydor made a perfect shot into the right
top corner of the net and over the shoulder of Dominik Hasek. The
Stars were up, 1-0, at the 2:23 mark, and they proceeded to get
stronger and stronger.
</P>
<P>
   Modano was one half of a potent Stars punch with fellow center
Joe Nieuwendyk. Nieuwendyk's best scoring chance came at the 12:20
mark during a two-on-one when he blasted a shot at Hasek from the
left circle. Hasek made the save, but the Sabres were having a hard
time containing the Stars' surging offense.
</P>
<P>
   It was the antithesis of Game 4 in which the Sabres completely
bottled up the Stars and didn't allow them to get anything going.
Thursday &UR;  &LR; night, it was the Sabres who had a hard time generating
any offense. Buffalo's power play, which was so stunning against
the Senators, Bruins, and Maple Leafs, started off very effectively
in this series. In the first two games, Buffalo converted 3 of 8
opportunities. However, in the next two games and through two
periods Thursday &UR;  &LR; night, the Sabres had gone 0 for 16 on the man
advantage, including 0 for 3 Thursday &UR;  &LR; night.
</P>
<P>
   At 15:21 of the third, the Stars added an insurance goal on a
nice move by veteran forward Pat Verbeek. Modano picked up the puck
from defenseman Alexei Zhitnik and kicked it up to defenseman
Richard Matvichuk, who skated it up the left side. He dished a pass
from the left circle into the slot for Verbeek, who slalomed down
and beat Hasek with a backhander inside the left post. It was
Verbeek's third goal of the postseason and first of the finals.
</P>
<P>
   Modano said he wouldn't shy away from more talks with Hitchcock,
only because he won't be able to avoid them. When asked if he
thought about changing his phone number, Modano laughed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always has my number,'' he said. ``He has got every number
I think I have, so he tracks me down wherever I'm at.''

HILL CLIMBING SOCCER MOUNTAINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Laurie Hill is using this year to serve her
mission. She isn't Mormon, mind you, just Mexican on her mother's
side.
</P>
<P>
   The West L.A. resident's dual citizenship set into motion a
sequence of events that steered her to Mexico City recently, where
she managed to convert at least one man into a fan of women's
soccer.
</P>
<P>
   The way Hill did it speaks of the success already enjoyed by the
makeshift Mexican squad that will compete in the Women's World Cup,
starting this weekend. Mexico, which is coached by Cal State L.A.'s
Leonardo Cuellar, will meet fast-improving Brazil on Saturday in
East Rutherford, N.J., in a first-round match.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican team, which features 10 players who grew up playing
soccer on the U.S. club and college scene, was ensconced in the
same soccer facility routinely used by the top male players in
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of policemen patrolled the grounds and Hill conversed
with them in Spanish every day. Toward the end of the team's stay,
one of the policemen told Hill how much her geniality meant to him.
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't like some of the top male players, he explained, who
wear an air of superiority borne of years of being coddled and
ogled and adored. He could relate to her, even if her background
was decidedly different.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, Hill, 29, knew her mission wasn't impossible.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to suggest it has been easy, winning converts to
women's soccer. Sure, the sport is Mexico's national pastime. Alas,
chauvinism runs a close second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexico is more male-dominated,'' was Hill's diplomatic way of
explaining the cultural divide that awaited her south of the
border.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-foot-1 midfielder and her teammates have been waging a
counterattack on two fronts, trying to narrow the gap between
Mexico and the world's powers in women's soccer while also working
tirelessly to bridge the country's gender gap in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just an avenue to the World Cup for us,'' said Hill,
who studied biology at UC Santa Barbara and has deferred nursing
school for a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more meaning to it than that. Most people we've come
across in Mexico have never seen women play soccer. The women's
program is a whole new territory for them. We want to open people's
eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   They wouldn't be true missionaries if they didn't have to make
do without certain creature comforts. When the team first
assembled, it didn't have a doctor or trainer and the players had
to wash their uniforms in sinks. Money, Hill said ``is always an
issue.'' The support, she said, ``could be better.''
</P>
<P>
   Understand this: Hill, 29, isn't complaining. Not even close.
Since Mexico became the first Spanish-speaking country to qualify
for the Women's World Cup this past December, her life has been
infinitely richer.
</P>
<P>
   It's amazing how vibrant the colors of each day can be when you
break out of your comfort zone and push through adversity.
``That,'' Hill said, ``is when you learn the most about yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   The disappointment of not making the U.S. national team _ Hill
tried out in 1992 and again in '95, after a one-year professional
stint in Japan _ dissipated as soon as she started touring Mexico
with the national team. Everywhere she went, she felt she was home.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer, which has given her life its rhyme and rhythm since she
was 5, became a salsa beat stirring emotions deep inside her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soccer is a passion that breaks down barriers wherever you
are,'' said Hill, who starred at UC Santa Barbara in the late
1980s. ``I feel so connected to the Mexican people. It has been
such a positive life experience. I feel like we're really breaking
new ground.''
</P>
<P>
   She's found affirmation even in the negative results. A while
back the U.S. and Mexico squads met in a friendly. The U.S. won,
9-0.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. players could have taken a dim view of their college
and club teammates who crossed the border to catch up to their
dreams. Instead, the Americans who had once beaten out the likes of
Hill for berths on the U.S. team were gracious and supportive.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Forward) Tiffeny Milbrett said to me, `You know, I think it's
really great that you're doing this,''' Hill said.
</P>
<P>
   The players who lost their positions to U.S. imports weren't so
chivalrous. Bad feelings festered. From the enmity, a mutual
respect eventually rose. It happened when the Mexican players
realized the Mexican-Americans were intent on showing them the way,
not the door.
</P>
<P>
   The future of women's soccer in Mexico, after all, isn't its
imported talent. It's all the teen-age girls that Hill and her
teammates have reached out and touched. They've baptized an entire
generation, and how many missionaries can boast that? &QL;

AL GORE, REP. NORM DICKS HAVE FORGED LASTING FRIENDSHIP OVER THE
YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON AND JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Norm Dicks, the gruff linebacker from Bremerton,
Wash., and Al Gore, the smooth-talking newsman from Carthage,
Tenn., were rivals when they first met because they had something
in common: they were the two best-connected members of Congress'
1976 freshman class.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore and Dicks quickly became personal friends and political
allies. They will be together in Seattle on Friday as Gore touches
down on the last stop of a tour launching his campaign for the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign Chairman Tony Coelho describes Washington as a
``critical'' state on Gore's path to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   In a business where friendships get strained in the quest for
power, and sometimes are broken by disagreements of principle, Gore
and Dicks have forged a lasting relationship important to both men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Norm is one of my very closest friends in the Congress, and he
and (wife) Suzie have been close friends to Tipper and me for
almost a quarter century,'' Gore said in a telephone interview
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It began with a competition between two House rookies eager to
win a seat on the money-dispensing House Appropriations Committee.
Gore could be seen walking the corridors of the Capitol with his
biggest asset in tow _ his father, former three-term Sen. Albert
Gore Sr., D-Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   But Dicks was no novice to Capitol infighting and had his own
patrons _ former boss, Sen. Warren Magnuson, and two powerful
colleagues, Rules Committee member Lloyd Meeds and House
Agriculture Committee Chairman Tom Foley, all Washington Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Dicks recognized that the affable Gore was more popular among
the freshman class, but he successfully persuaded his fellow
freshmen not to choose among themselves but to let the committee
assignment be made by the old bulls of the House leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Now, more than two decades later, Dicks still sits in that seat
on his beloved Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Dicks says jokingly that he deserves credit for the vice
president's subsequent success: Gore wound up on the Commerce
Committee, where he managed to garner tremendous publicity from a
series of hearings and launched himself into the Senate. Gore
agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within a few days of that competition, we were competing
against each other on the basketball court, and competing on the
same team (in Congress) and we became close friends,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a similar sense of humor, we both laugh a lot together
and we both married above ourselves,'' he added. ``We also both
remember the old days ... and we share a common set of historical
memories from that era. We can talk in a kind of a shorthand that
some others don't understand right away, because we're referring to
debates that took place 30 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore has appointed Dicks as one of two congressmen trying to
rally support for the vice president in the House, and he is
looking to Dicks to help him raise money and win support around the
country, not least in Seattle, where Mayor Paul Schell has endorsed
Gore's primary rival, former Sen. Bill Bradley, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington state is critical to our election in November of
2000, and we're also very conscious of the primary,'' Coelho said.
``Norm is very engaged in giving us the state of the state,
politically and otherwise. When I decided to do this job, Al and I
talked about his friends that we trusted, and Norm was on that list
of people.''
</P>
<P>
   Dicks, who counts himself both a fan and friend of the vice
president, also has much to gain.
</P>
<P>
   In a Gore administration, Dicks could be a contender for
director of Central Intelligence or secretary of Defense. Even if
Dicks remains in Congress, which he believes is likely, he could be
chairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee in a
Democrat-run House. Together, he and the environmentally conscious
Gore would be in a unique position to tackle the ticklish natural
resources problems of the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Congress, I enjoy my job on the Appropriations
Committee, I am not seeking anything else and, frankly, Gore is
going to need allies in the Congress,'' Dicks said. ``I'd love to
be chairman of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee with Al
Gore as president of the United States. We could take care of the
parks in this country, the Everglades, and do the right things in
Washington state for salmon, restoring those species up and down
the West Coast.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said it is too early to talk about what role Dicks might
play in a Gore administration.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year friendship between Dicks and Gore, forged in those
first weeks as freshmen, was nurtured in the 1980s by two shared
passions: arms control and basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are similarities in personality, albeit camouflaged,''
said former Rep. Al Swift, D-Wash. ``Al Gore is a very aggressive,
very bright, on-the-move guy who has never been publicity shy. And
so is Norm. (And ) they were not your standard, knee-jerk
conservative Democrats. Al and Norm reflected a Henry Jackson-type
position, strong on defense but quite liberal on domestic policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Dicks and Gore were at the center of a group of Democrats in
Congress who supported the controversial MX missile as a lever to
get President Reagan to back away from confrontation with the
Soviet Union and to support some degree of nuclear arms control.
</P>
<P>
   The two also were among a group of competitors who bonded in the
House gym.
</P>
<P>
   Gore tells the story of how Dicks, a one-time University of
Washington linebacker, would shout ``Huskies'' each time he made a
long shot. And Dicks still marvels at a trick shot Gore had
perfected in the shooting contest called horse, in which Gore would
bounce the ball off the wall and into the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were both hard-chargers; they're a lot alike,'' said
former Gov. Mike Lowry, who served in the House with them.
</P>
<P>
   Their relationship was cemented in 1988. Dicks was one of a
handful of House members to endorse Gore in his ill-fated first
campaign for president. After it was over, Dicks helped Gore raise
money to retire his debt.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Dicks again is helping Gore in the House and in
Washington state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Norm has just one gear, and that's full speed ahead,'' said
Rep. Bart Gordon, D-Tenn., who is co-chairing the Gore effort in
the House with Dicks. So far, the two have lined up 180 of the 211
House Democrats to support Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been the Clinton administration's point man on such
Northwest issues as helping forest communities hurt by logging
cuts. Gore is central to the administration's efforts to help the
Northwest pay for salmon conservation.
</P>
<P>
   Dicks credits Gore with helping to force a renegotiation of the
U.S.-Canada salmon treaty, and with helping to steer the coveted
November meeting of the World Trade Organization to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship hasn't meant that Dicks, who is never bashful
about demanding federal largesse for his individual and corporate
constituents, gets everything he wants.
</P>
<P>
   The administration was not particularly helpful to Dicks in his
battles to fund the B-2 bomber _ a plane Clinton now celebrates
because of its usefulness in Kosovo _ and Dicks was openly
disappointed that Gore didn't do more to help Washington cities win
empowerment zone grants, although Tacoma did get a consolation
prize of $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my 31st year as part of this delegation _ eight with
Maggie, and 23 in the House _ and we've never had an administration
that's given us the help that this administration has given us,''
Dicks said. ``Al's been there for us in everything we've asked him
to do, and he deeply cares, as we all know, about the environment,
which I think is a good issue in Washington state.''

HOUSE DEALS A STINGING DEFEAT TO GUN CONTROLS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for updating, rewriting throughout)   (sw) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL and FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a stunning victory for the National Rifle
Association, the House early on Friday morning narrowly approved a
provision to regulate sales at gun shows that is substantially
weaker than legislation passed by the Senate last month.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, sponsored by Rep. John Dingell, a Michigan Democrat
working in conjunction with Republicans, eked through a tense House
by a vote of 218 to 211 just after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   It drew the support of 173 Republicans and 45 Democrats. Most of
the Democrats _ or 163 of them _ stuck with President Clinton and
their party in opposition to the amendment. They drew 47 moderate
Republicans and one independent to their side.
</P>
<P>
   As the narrowness of the vote became clear, Democrats sought to
punctuate how things might be different if they had control of the
House. Led by Rep. Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island, who is their
campaign chairman, they chanted ``Six seats, six seats,'' the
increase in seats they need to win in 2000 to regain the majority.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Rep. Tom DeLay, the House minority whip who had
worked tirelessly for passage of the Dingell measure, clapped his
hands once as his victory became clear. He walked over to hug
Dingell, who was on the Republican side of the aisle. Speaker
Dennis Hastert also cast his vote with Dingell.
</P>
<P>
   Later on Friday morning, a competing gun-show amendment favored
by most Democrats failed by a vote of 193 to 235. It was sponsored
by Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., who was elected to Congress after
her husband was killed by a gunman on the Long Island Rail Road in
1993, and it mirrored the Senate legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Near tears, Mrs. McCarthy chided the House for playing politics.
She said she had come to Congress only to prevent others from
suffering the fate of her husband and her son, who was also
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me go home,'' she said. ``Let me go home. I love working
with all of you people. I think all of you are great. But somehow
we sometimes lose sight of why we are all here. And I'm trying to
remind you of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats, and many Republicans, gave her a standing
ovation.
</P>
<P>
   The moment capped a long two days and nights of clashes over gun
control and social issues.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday night, Rep. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., spoke out
uncompromisingly in favor of the constitutional right to bear arms.
``The majority of the amendments we're debating aren't about saving
lives,'' he said. ``They're about taking rights away from
law-abiding citizens. What we're talking about is gun control and
that is the wrong issue.''
</P>
<P>
   In an effort by each side to draw support from across the aisle,
Republican pro-gun forces gave some of their speaking time to a
parade of conservative Democrats, while Democrats showcased
Republican allies on gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Several more gun-control measures are to be considered by the
House later on Friday, but the success of the Dingell gun-show
measure threw the entire fate of the final bill in doubt. John P.
Feehery, a spokeman for Hastert, said: ``There's a lot of risk left
in this bill. There are a lot of dynamics.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, liberal Democrats were threatening to bolt from the
final bill because its gun-show provision is too weak, while
conservatives were saying they could oppose it if additional
amendments, such as one to raise the minimum age for the purchase
of all handguns or another to ban the import of high-capacity
ammunition clips, should pass and make the bill too strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The less gun control, the more apt it is to pass,'' said DeLay
who had worked hard to persuade conservatives to rally around
Dingell's bill in order to trump stronger versions. Another
gun-show provision sponsored by Rep. Henry Hyde, Republican of
Illinois, had been contained in the base bill under consideration
and represented a midpoint between the other versions.
</P>
<P>
   If the final bill is passed in its current form, it would be
different enough from the Senate version to force it into a
conference committee. And it is not clear how President Clinton
will react to a measure with a weaker gun-control provisions.
</P>
<P>
   The late-night showdown over the gun-show measures came
centerstage after two days of sometimes impassioned clashes over
God, values, the entertainment industry and the Constitution. That
debate culminated early Thursday night in passage by a vote of
287-139 of a wide-ranging bill that would provide $1.5 billion for
fighting juvenile crime and enact tough mandatory minimum sentences
for young people in gun crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In a victory for social conservatives, the House voted 248-180
to include in the crime bill an amendment sponsored by Rep. Robert
Aderholt, R-Ala., giving states the right to allow the display of
the Ten Commandments in public places, including schools.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand that simply posting the Ten Commandments will not
instantly change the moral character of our nation,'' Aderholt, the
measure's sponsor, said just before it passed. ``However, it is an
important step to promote morality and an end of children killing
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., and other critics countered that
the amendment raised constitutional questions, including whether it
would pass muster on the separation of church and state. ``Whose
Ten Commandments?'' Nadler asked. ``Which version? The Catholic
version? The Protestant version? Or the Jewish version?''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday evening, long after prime time, the House turned to
the gun-control debate, which is the preferred political ground of
the Democrats. A dozen separate gun amendments were under
consideration, ranging from a measure requiring child-safety
devices to be sold with handguns to a proposal to repeal the
District of Columbia's ban on the possession of firearms.
</P>
<P>
   But the most significant showdown was over the rival measures of
varying strictness to regulate sales of weapons at gun shows, at
which collectors and hobbyists selling firearms are not now
required to conduct the kinds of background checks on buyers that
licensed dealers are.
</P>
<P>
   In a fierce lobbying blitz, Clinton arose early Thursday in
Paris to telephone four wavering Democrats: Gary Condit and Mike
Thompson of California, Marion Berry of Arkansas and Ron Kind of
Wisconsin, to urge them to vote for the gun-show amendment
sponsored by Mrs. McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is crazy for the United States to be the only advanced
country in the world that doesn't take comprehensive, sensible,
thorough steps to keep handguns out of the hands of criminals,''
Clinton told reporters in Paris, where he was attending a summit of
industrialized nations. ``It's just _ it doesn't make any sense.''
</P>
<P>
   To hammer home the point the White House sent Attorney General
Janet Reno to the Capitol late Thursday afternoon. As the debate
neared a vote, Republicans said that Clinton and the attorney
general were still calling a handful of wavering Republicans from
mostly suburban districts who could turn the outcome either way.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association and DeLay shored up support among
conservatives for the weaker version sponsored by Dingell, who is a
former member of the NRA board.
</P>
<P>
   All day long Dingell had insisted that he was going to win. He
said that Clinton would not make headway with conservative
Democrats because ``he cost us control of the House and a lot of
people remember that.'' The Republicans won the majority in 1994,
months after Congress enacted a ban on assault weapons avidly
sought by Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the NRA has largely held sway on Capitol Hill. But
after the school shootings in Littleton, the Senate last month _
with Vice President Al Gore casting the tie-breaking vote _
approved a proposal that would compel all vendors at gun shows,
licensed or unlicensed to run such checks. Law enforcement
officials are given three business days to complete the checks.
</P>
<P>
   And in debate Thursday night, Rep. Jay Inslee, D-Wash., recalled
that he lost his seat in 1994 for favoring gun control and then
been re-elected. ``It was bitter and it was painful,'' he said of
his defeat. ``But I have not regretted that vote for one minute. No
congressman's seat is more important than any child's life.''
</P>
<P>
   Dingell's amendment on gun shows differs significantly from the
Senate's. Its definition of what constitutes a gun show is narrow,
and only 24 hours would be allotted for background checks. Mrs.
McCarthy's version is similar to the Senate legislation.
</P>
<P>
   In other votes on Wednesday and Thursday, the House approved a
variety of measures signaling support, sometimes symbolic and
sometimes more concrete, for public expressions of religion. The
debate over the Ten Commandments was the most spirited.
</P>
<P>
   But the House also overwhelmingly approved measures allowing the
use of religious language in memorials on school grounds and
prohibiting discrimination against religious organizations in the
awarding of contracts to provide social services.

 By BILL SULLIVAN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
DALLAS _ They have butted heads, each trying to impose his will and
style on the other, with neither ever quite getting it his way.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ask about the relationship, and Mike Modano smiles and shakes
his head. Ask Ken Hitchcock, and the slight grin hints at battles
won and lost.
</P>
<P>
   Strange bedfellows, to be sure, these two. But with a Stanley
Cup hanging in the balance Thursday night at Reunion Arena, Modano
the star and Hitchcock the coach got together on the essentials of
a 2-0 Dallas Stars win over the Buffalo Sabres, an outcome that
gives Dallas a three games to two lead in the best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a pretty close relationship,'' Hitchcock said after
watching Modano assist on both goals. ``I've spent a lot of time
with him, and I'm able to say some things candidly that maybe I'm
not able to say to other players.''
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of this pivotal Game 5, Hitchcock phoned with a
simple question: Could the Stars expect to see a full effort from
their best player, or would it be more of the timid play Modano _
who has been playing with a fractured left wrist _ offered in Game
4?
</P>
<P>
   ``He plain and simple asked me what kind of player I was going
to be tonight,'' Modano said. ``I told him I was going to be
involved in every aspect of the game. I got away from that a little
bit in Game 4.''
</P>
<P>
   Game 6 is Saturday night in Buffalo, where the Sabres will try
to avoid elimination and force a seventh game here Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Modano had much to do with pushing Buffalo to the brink. He
didn't score in this one, but his impact was felt everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   He found Darryl Sydor with a perfect setup for the first goal of
the game at 2 minutes, 23 seconds of the second period. Modano then
helped close the deal when he dug the puck out of the corner and
got it out to Richard Matvichuk, who fed Pat Verbeek for an
insurance score at 15:21 of the third.
</P>
<P>
   Modano was on the ice for nearly 21{ minutes, the most of any
Dallas forward. He won 15 faceoffs, had three takeaways and blocked
a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike made great plays,'' Sydor said. ``A lot of people have
been on him through the series and through the playoffs. He's just
sticking with it and doing his thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano's thing has changed in the eight years since he helped
the Minnesota North Stars get to the Stanley Cup Finals. In Dallas'
defense-first system, checking and defense have taken priority over
fancy skating and piling up goals.
</P>
<P>
   Those alterations were the source of heated discussions between
coach and player, but they have the Stars a game away from claiming
hockey's greatest prize.
</P>
<P>
   This time, when Hitchcock called, the star of the Stars knew
what needed to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took it to his heart and went about his business today,''
Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Modano was not alone in that regard. Goalie Ed Belfour stopped
all 23 Buffalo shots for his seventh career playoff shutout,
getting the best of Dominik Hasek, who could handle only 19 of 21.
Dallas also blocked 20 shots and dished out 39 hits to the Sabres'
36.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought both teams emotionally gave it everything they
had,'' Sabres coach Lindy Ruff said. ``It was tight as tight could
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Early on, this one seemed destined to be a different story. If
the Stars felt any sense of urgency to avoid heading back to
Buffalo facing elimination, it wasn't readily apparent in a
lethargic first period. The Sabres outshot Dallas 9-8 and were
credited with one more hit (12-11). Even more telling were the
Stars' eight giveways and a paltry two blocked shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first period was the best anyone has played against us in
our building all year,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Belfour kept the game scoreless after 20 minutes, and
Dallas showed signs of life at the start of the second period. With
the Sabres' Curtis Brown off for interference, the Stars cashed in
on the power play. Modano found Sydor with a nifty cross-ice pass,
and Sydor beat Hasek high and to the goalie's left to make it 1-0
at 2:23 of the period.
</P>
<P>
   Sydor had a golden opportunity to give his team a virtually
unheard-of two-goal lead just a few minutes later when he
accompanied Modano on a break but could not get his stick on a nice
pass through the crease.
</P>
<P>
   But the one-goal lead held up through two periods as Belfour
came up with a big glove save on a blast off the stick of Jay McKee
in the final minute. Dallas held a 15-14 edge in shots at the
second intermission and was beginning to get the better end of the
flow. Still, the Sabres were just a shot away from tying the game,
and they stayed right there until the final five minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Modano dug the puck out of the corner and got it ahead
to Matvichuk, who was off on a two-on-one with Verbeek. Matvichuk
fed Verbeek in the middle, and Verbeek faked the shot, then slipped
by Hasek for a backhand that gave the Stars a 2-0 lead and
breathing room.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, there were smiles all around the Dallas locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike doesn't have to score to get the job done for us,'' Sydor
said. ``He does a lot of other things, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, when it mattered most, Modano did them. The art of
compromise leaves the Stars on the lip of the Cup.

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PINEHURST, N.C. _ There is no place Phil Mickelson should rather be
than right here, right now. He has waited all his life for
something like this _ a U.S. Open with his name written all over
it.
</P>
<P>
   But Mickelson's plane is parked at the airport. It's fueled and
ready to fly. Back home, there's a baby about to be born that also
will have Mickelson's name written all over it.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's not even a question of should I stay or go,''
Mickelson said Thursday. ``I'm out of here.''
</P>
<P>
   But suppose that Sunday afternoon Mickelson is making the turn
with a two-shot lead in the Open, when the call comes from home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm leaving,'' he said. ``A tournament doesn't even stack
up.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a matter of a young father's priceless moment against maybe
a $625,000 U.S. Open moment. It's a matter of walking away from the
best chance yet to etch his name in golfing lore, all because back
home in Scottsdale, Ariz., there's a Mickelson _ or Mickel-daughter
_ on the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always going to be U.S. Opens,'' Mickelson said. ``You
only have your firstborn once.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, this Open's only water hazard might be 2,000 miles away
and about to break.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, there might not be a player better-equipped to handle the
Pinehurst challenges Donald Ross laid out nearly a century ago. But
Mickelson's bags are packed, and a driver _ the kind behind a
steering wheel _ is on 24-hour call.
</P>
<P>
   If there was any doubt this one-time boy wonder has grown up,
wonder no more.
</P>
<P>
   Here is this 29-year-old talent, whose most recent reputation
has been the ever-cruel ``Best Player Never To Have Won A Major,''
not caring a bit that this week might belong to him.
</P>
<P>
   And here's the ironic twist: Mickelson finally has a lush stage
on which to show off all the tricks in his golf bag, and it all
might be sidetracked by the arrival of the latest Mickelson boy
wonder. Or girl wonder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to win a major, of course,'' Mickelson said. ``And I've
never been more excited about a U.S. Open. In past years in the
Open, the short game has been rendered practically obsolete. It was
a little frustrating. If you didn't get it on the green, you just
tried to knock it out of the high grass and put it in. But this is
perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Never has it looked more like a tournament Mickelson could own,
as his opening-round 67 on Thursday showed. Playing alongside
Esteban Toledo and David Duval, Mickelson moved the ball here and
there off the tee masterfully.
</P>
<P>
   Around the perilous crowned greens, he pulled all sorts of clubs
out of his bag _ everything from a 3-wood to a 4-iron to a putter.
</P>
<P>
   It was as if he was a kid with a set of new toys, eagerly
playing with each one, then tossing it aside for the next one. He
hopped the ball onto the green on near-perfect lines all day.
</P>
<P>
   He putted like magic, holing a 30-footer on the 383-yard par-4
13th for birdie, following with a 10-foot birdie on the testy
436-yard 14th and ending the round with a spiraling 14-footer to
save par.
</P>
<P>
   He was just like a kid again, the boy wonder. But of course, we
know he's all grown up because he'll drop it all at the buzz of a
beeper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been this excited about a golf course in a long
time,'' Mickelson said. ``It brings out every shot in the bag. If
you're off the green, it's going to be tough, but you're still
going to have a shot. You'll have a lie. You just have to create a
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   He chipped in for birdie on the monstrous, mean 482-yard par-4
No. 5, which played as the toughest hole of the day. He knocked
smart shots to the green on so many holes, playing partner Carlos
Franco called him ``someone who knows what this game is about.''
</P>
<P>
   But more. Only moments after he finished the 3-under 67, which
shared the first-round lead with David Duval, Billy Mayfair and
Paul Goydos, he talked about knowing what life is all about.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have told Mickelson the baby is not due for two more
weeks, but it could come early. And if it does, he says he'll walk
off the course no matter what the leader board says.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 20 years old, I used to think winning a major was
everything,'' Mickelson said. ``But what would I tell my kid years
from now I wasn't there because I was playing golf?''
</P>
<P>
   Just look at the boy wonder now. He's all grown up, doing the
responsible thing, slaying a course that seems to be made for him
and calling it all just a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you go by what I saw today,'' Franco said, ``you have to
believe Mickelson will be there on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, you have to believe it. But he'll be there only if the
cellular phone in his caddie's bag doesn't ring or the pager
clipped to his pants pocket doesn't buzz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figure it's going to be five hours and 15 minutes from the
time I get the beep to the time I arrive at the hospital,''
Mickelson said. ``I'll get out of here real fast, then it's about
20 minutes to get in the air, four hours and 45 minutes to fly
back, then 10 minutes to the hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   And then it will be a lifetime of memories that he calls
priceless. And even for those who wouldn't consider Mickelson's
possible decision priceless, at least we know where the bidding
could start _ $625,000.

   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ At the Gracanica monastery, the holiest
site in eastern Kosovo, leaders of the Serbian Orthodox Church and
a NATO general joined Thursday night to implore some 2,000 anxious
Serbs to remain in Kosovo rather than follow the thousands who have
fled in long convoys behind withdrawing Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
   Patriarch Pavle, Serbian Orthodoxy's highest-ranking cleric,
urged Serbs not to sacrifice the efforts of their forebears to keep
Kosovo Serbian under the Ottoman occupation.
</P>
<P>
   Archbishop Artemije of Rasca and Prizren called on them to trust
in the peacekeeping forces, known as KFOR, to be patient and to
remain at home for a few days, saying: ``So my message is that our
national interest is to stay in our homes and in our churches and
in our towns and in our Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining them, with a priest translating from the balcony, was a
British major general, John Drewienkiewicz, who said: ``KFOR is
here for all the communities of Kosovo, and that means every one of
you. You live here, and you belong here.'' He promised that an
agreement being worked out ``would lead to the demilitarization of
the so-called KLA.''
</P>
<P>
   Drewienkiewicz was chief of operations of the Kosovo
Verification Mission, run by the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   As Yugoslav forces completed their withdrawal from the south of
Kosovo, the NATO-led peacekeeping forces have been slow to move
into the west of the province, near the Albanian border, creating a
vacuum of authority that has led Serbian civilians to flee, fearing
revenge from the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   Artemije himself fled the city on Wednesday, despite the
presence of German troops, NATO and U.N. officials.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting here Thursday with the bishop and the patriarch,
the foreign military and political leaders promised all possible
efforts to show their evenhandedness and to convince the minority
Serbs that they will be protected.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gen. Michael Jackson, the commander of KFOR, and Sergio
Vieira de Mello, the special representative of the U.N. secretary
general, apparently failed to convince Bishop Artemije to return
immediately to Prizren.
</P>
<P>
   But he promised Thursday that he would return when security
improves. He was sharply critical of NATO, nonetheless, for
allowing attacks on Serbs fleeing from Prizren, saying: ``Armed
members of the KLA in uniform in the center of the town disarmed
Serbs, kidnapped them and mistreated them,'' and he said that a
priest was arrested by the KLA ``and we don't know where he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and Vieira de Mello also appeared on Kosovo state
television with local leaders to reassure the Serbs and answer
questions from viewers.
</P>
<P>
   They have met with Albanian political leaders of all stripes,
including Jakup Krasniqi, the political spokesman for the KLA,
urging patience, calm and reconciliation, even as the military is
working out an understanding with the insurgents on how they will
be demilitarized.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Thursday, Vieira de Mello, who is in charge of
the civilian life of Kosovo, said that the future of the KLA is
political, not military.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no point engaging in this whole operation unless the
ultimate objective is to transform Kosovo into a model of
multiparty democracy that settles arguments without guns,'' he
said. ``So the KLA will become a political force with whatever name
it chooses, while its fighters will presumably demobilize.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the insurgents would form the backbone of a new police
force, Vieira de Mello said that there would be an international
police force set up with some 3,000 foreigners, who would recruit
and train a multiethnic police force. That force would, at least
initially, put Serbian police in Serbian areas and Albanian and
other Muslim minorities as police in their own areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those fighters who wish to apply for the new Kosovo police
force we will set up and train will be welcome to apply,'' he said
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Part of Vieira de Mello's problems are bureaucratic and
institutional. The United Nations is still trying to decide what
``interim civil authority'' means in the Security Council
resolution that governs the Kosovo settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a state within a state, giving Vieira de Mello and his
permanent successor full executive and administrative power here,
like a czar? Or is it a weaker idea, with effective power to be
shared with Belgrade, Yugoslavia, and its designated local leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The presumption here is that the United Nations will opt for a
stronger authority to keep order while a local census, elections
and institutions can be built over time to give Kosovo real
self-government and autonomy within Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For now, Vieira de Mello says he is operating with a skeleton
staff of 20 policy professionals and 10 support people, including
security, all of whom were seconded from other agencies. But now
that the United Nations, only on Monday, advanced its Kosovo
mission some $200 million, he is able to start hiring.
</P>
<P>
   The mission of the U.N. high commissioner for refugees has only
another 20 people to start, and various charities, like the World
Food Program and Doctors of the World, are beginning to work here
in earnest. They delivered emergency food supplies Thursday
morning, for example, to blasted Albanian villages like Stimlje and
Petrovo, where the Mother Theresa Society, the local Albanian
charity, will distribute aid to the needy, including refugees
returning home from the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There is now a heavier KFOR presence along that road, which has
been the scene of heavy KLA sniping and where German and British
journalists have been wounded over the last two days.
</P>
<P>
   Fehmi Baftiu, the head of the Mother Theresa chapter in Stimlje,
said the Albanians appreciated all aid, but needed more substantial
supplies of flour, cooking oil, sugar, beans, macaroni, blankets
and even spoons and forks. ``Our reserves are spent and we could do
no planting at all,'' he said. ``We don't have milk. The Serbs even
stole our cattle and our corn.''
</P>
<P>
   He spoke in a medical clinic that was looted by Serbian forces,
who took all the medicines, beds and diagnostic equipment,
including an EKG machine. About 60 percent of the town of 13,000
people was burned the first night of the NATO bombing, March 24,
Baftiu said. ``That night they started to burn and shoot, whether
people were in their houses or not.'' The rampage lasted five days,
leaving Stimlje a ruin and its population mostly dispersed.
</P>
<P>
   To deal with Kosovo's reconstruction, which will be the bulk of
the world's commitment here, U.N. agencies will handle the issue of
aid; the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe will
probably handle democracy training and institution-building; the
European Union will handle and pay for reconstruction of homes,
roads and bridges.
</P>
<P>
   But the United Nations will be in charge, Vieira de Mello
insisted.
</P>
<P>
   The trickiest issue, he said, is how to handle civil
administration. For example, who pays the civil servants here,
Belgrade or the United Nations? What happens to local taxes? Who
collects the garbage or runs the water system? Will the Yugoslav
dinar remain the local currency, or will the informal currency
here, the German mark, become the formal one? Does Belgrade
continue to get the profits from electricity supply and from state
industries like vineyards and coal mining?
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One of Vieira de Mello's earliest tasks will be to appoint five
district commissioners and 29 municipal administrators to help him
run Kosovo. Each municipality will have a U.N. police commissioner
to set up the initial police force of 3,000 foreigners to take over
local policing from KFOR troops.
</P>
<P>
   The municipal administrators will appoint civil-liaison
officers, who will themselves set up local advisory councils, to
deal with residents, local leaders and civic needs and services.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``There is lots of work to do, more than in Bosnia or
Cambodia,'' Vieira de Mello said.
</P>
<P>
   Britain estimated Thursday that the Serbs had killed at least
10,000 civilians, and the uncovering of wartime horrors continued
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In towns like Poklek, Bruznik, Berisht and Vlastica, journalists
were shown or told of a series of killings of Albanians by the
Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Lt. Col. Robin Clifford Thursday urged
journalists not to use ``emotive words like mass graves'' before
any proper forensic investigation. ``There are fresh burial
sites,'' he said. ``But remember there was a war here. It's up to
the tribunal to investigate.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He said that 26,000 of Yugoslavia's 40,000 troops and police had
withdrawn from Kosovo on schedule. All Serb forces must be gone by
Sunday night, while several hundred will return to guard border
posts and holy sites.
</P>
<P>
   British troops also brought journalists on a guided tour of an
interrogation center at police headquarters here. The cellar
contained knives, batons, batteries, baseball bats, brass knuckles,
a box of condoms and a sword. After the display, they cordoned the
building off for tribunal investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Serb officials said it was odd that the police would have
cleared the building of every file and lightbulb but left a
so-called ``torture chamber'' to be discovered, complete with even
a chain saw.
</P>
<P>
   But KFOR's biggest victory Thursday was finally restoring the
water supply to Pristina after three hot summer days. Serbian
workers at four pumping stations fled after failing to get the
protection they sought from KFOR, and some of them disabled the
stations.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of changing times, the first two KLA soldiers
showed up at the Grand Hotel, where the Serbian army and police
often ate and worked. They were not authentic Kosovo Albanians,
however, but an English mercenary and an American Albanian who came
to offer themselves for interviews.

 By JONATHAN FEIGEN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
SAN ANTONIO _ By 4:45 a.m. Thursday, Don Chaney, blurry-eyed and
groggy, finally turned off the VCR. He put down his legal pad and
put in for a wake-up call for roughly four hours later.
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is not an unusual practice for an NBA assistant coach,
particularly one facing a 1-0 deficit in the NBA Finals and a
riddle, as do Chaney and the other New York Knicks coaches.
</P>
<P>
   But after hours of examining the tapes for secrets, studying the
San Antonio Spurs' defense and considering its strengths and
oddities, Chaney was forced to ask himself how to exploit a
weakness he could not find.
</P>
<P>
   ``They take away,'' Chaney said, ``what you want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere in those tapes there must be a clue to the weakness in
the Spurs' defense.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of finding things to exploit, Chaney, the former
Rockets player and coach, found offensive tactics the Spurs would
not allow. They remove penetration to the basket, stubbornly stay
with outside shooters and refuse to try the gambles that could
create openings.
</P>
<P>
   The more he looked, the less he found.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do things a little different defensively than a lot of
teams, and it's paid off for us big-time,'' Spurs forward Sean
Elliott said. ``There's a lot of times, when a man penetrates, he
wants us to do things a lot differently than we've ever done.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of teams want to penetrate to dish the ball to open
shooters. We don't leave the shooters. We let the big men handle
the penetration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're more cohesive as a unit. We have each other's back more.
If a guy gets beat, guys are there to help him out. We don't settle
for, `Well, I just got beat.' Guys try to play great individual
defense out on the floor. And then we have two big guys to help
clean up the basket.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs led the NBA in field-goal defense each of the past two
seasons. They allowed opponents to make just 40.2 percent of their
shots in the regular season and in the playoffs heading into
Wednesday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Even with a sluggish start defensively against the Knicks, the
Spurs allowed New York to make just 31 of 81 shots (38.3 percent)
on Wednesday, just five of 22 in the decisive fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   And like the Portland Trail Blazers and Los Angeles Lakers
before them, the Knicks' offense quickly degenerated to, Knicks
coach Jeff Van Gundy said, ``frenetic'' one-on-one play and outside
shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have two big guys clogging up the paint, you resort
to shooting long jumpers,'' Knicks forward Marcus Camby said. ``We
have to drive the ball a lot more. We can't just settle for jump
shots. We have to bring it to them.''
</P>
<P>
   But that has proved next to impossible. Though there are
mysteries about the Spurs' defense, there are none about where its
dominance begins.
</P>
<P>
   ``They clog the middle up,'' Chaney said. ``Most teams thrive on
getting to the paint area, sucking the defense in and kicking the
ball out or driving all the way to the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're so big inside, they take away the initial drive.
They're great shot-blockers and very good athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the Spurs) do a very good job of covering the perimeter.
They don't worry about helping out inside, because they have two
guys who are very good at covering the paint.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not stiffs. They're two 7-footers who are very
athletic and can really move. That's their advantage. Most
7-footers take awhile to get from one side of the lane to the
other. These guys get there as fast as guards get there. They don't
need help in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of this, one of Spurs coach Gregg Popovich's first moves
was to break the Spurs of some basic defensive fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
   With David Robinson and Tim Duncan to patrol the lane and erase
defensive mistakes outside, when opposing players penetrate, which
is the Knicks' greatest strength, the Spurs' weak-side defenders do
not help. They remain on their assignments.
</P>
<P>
   A player beaten off the dribble does not rush to catch his man.
Instead, he finds a passing lane his man might try.
</P>
<P>
   ``We basically believe in some things a little different from
the norm,'' Popovich said. ``Having those two 7-footers out there
makes it easy to believe in those things. You might not have that
commitment to it if you didn't have Tim and David back there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Parts of it are good; parts of it are very weird that I
wouldn't recommend to anybody unless they had those kinds of
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Because some of the tenets of Popovich's defense are so unusual,
they took time to work. His schemes rely on players working well
together consistently, and that, they said, took time to develop,
particularly after a lifetime spent learning different defensive
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Because those schemes must be executed in sync, Popovich said
faith in the ``weird'' is crucial.
</P>
<P>
   But there comes a time the players also must believe in the
strength of their own defense. As unusual as some of the Spurs'
rotations off penetration might be, they are conservative outside,
rarely gambling or going for steals.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Spurs play basic man-to-man outside, making
opponents work to get to the next, tougher line of defense and
allowing little shot-clock time left for the three or four passes
Chaney said are needed to find an open shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have five people who trust each other defensively
and really believe in their guts, not just talk but in their guts,
that they can make stops whenever they need to make a stop,''
Popovich said. ``If you have five guys that believe that, that's
the most important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the Spurs' offense seems designed to help defensively,
especially against the fast-break-minded Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   With Duncan usually on the low post and Robinson often at a high
post, the Spurs generally have three players back, at least two at
the 3-point line. When teams try to break, they often find the
Spurs back because their perimeter players were in good defensive
position even when their team had the ball.
</P>
<P>
   But as with every defense, the Spurs leave an opening. Van
Gundy, Chaney and the Knicks coaches found it, too.
</P>
<P>
   If their tough-to-cover perimeter players penetrate, Duncan or
Robinson will come to meet them, and Spurs defenders will remain
close to the Knicks' shooters and jump into the passing lanes.
</P>
<P>
   But when Duncan and Robinson leave their men open, the Knicks
can pass for open midrange jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you really need against them is big guys who can make
perimeter shots, so as you suck them in you find your bigs guys
along the baseline on the perimeter,'' Van Gundy said. ``But right
now (with Patrick Ewing out and Larry Johnson playing hurt), that's
not us.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, well. Back to the tapes.

ALLSTATE SUING PROVIDERS TO GET $16 MILLION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Continuing its battle against what it says is
medical billing fraud, Allstate Insurance Co. on Thursday sued 21
California health care providers, including nine clinics in the Los
Angeles area, for $16 million.
</P>
<P>
   Defendants in the Los Angeles area include the Van Nuys Family
Health Center at 14402 Haynes St. and its owner, chiropractor
Behrouz Meshkinfam.
</P>
<P>
   The Northbrook, Ill., insurer claims that the doctors,
chiropractors and medical facilities it is targeting submitted
excessive bills for treatments provided.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy comes in with a little neck pain and they were treating
it like it was a life-threatening condition,'' said Los Angeles
attorney Dennis B. Kass, who is representing Allstate in the local
actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact they were doing nothing. We have 307 sets of medical
records sitting before us and they are all the same,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Meshkinfam was the only person named in the suits that could be
reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any information about that,'' he said of Allstate
allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Other individuals named in the suit are Dr. Hisham Muhyeldin,
Dr. Feras Haddad and chiropractors Noland Coons, Elyas Khury and
Jacqueline Ganjeh. Their hometowns were not available.
</P>
<P>
   The other medical facilities are Tri-Star Family Health Center,
10640 E. Valley Blvd. in El Monte owned by Muhyeldin; Wilshire
Tri-Star Medical Clinic at 2500 Wilshire Blvd., owned by Haddad;
Carson Community Medical Clinic, 675 E. University Drive and the
Carson Medical Clinic at the same address, both owned by Haddad;
Wilshire Rampart Health Center, owned by Muhyeldin; Value Care
Medical Clinic at 2412 S. Azusa Ave. in West Covina, owned by
Muhyeldin; Anaheim Walk In Medical Clinic at 842 S. Brookhurst in
Anaheim, owned by Muhyeldin; and El Monte Valley Health Center at
10640 E. Valley Blvd., owned by Haddad.
</P>
<P>
   Allstate has taken an aggressive stance against medical
insurance fraud. Last year, the company filed a $107 million
lawsuit in California against a ring that Allstate alleges has been
bilking insurers since at least 1992. The case is pending.
</P>
<P>
   Kass said that the company's first step following Thursday's
filing will be trying to settle the cases out of court.

</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-GRAVES (Qyshk, Yugoslavia) _ In a little over two hours
of wandering in three small villages near the city of Pec, it
became clear that anyone you asked could point you to graves or
places where Kosovo's Albanian civilians had been killed by Serbs.
The accounts in this tiny corner of Kosovo, emerging as Kosovo
Albanians return to their homes and as journalists and human rights
workers begin to range through the shattered province, suggest that
the death toll and the carnage may be even greater than previously
known. By John Kifner.

   KUWAIT-VOTE (Kuwait City) _ Until three weeks ago, the law that
laid out who could vote and seek office began ``Each Kuwaiti man.''
Subject to ratification by the next Parliament, it now begins `Each
Kuwaiti.'' The change, which shocked even its supporters, would
bring an end to an era in which political life has been an all-male
preserve. By Douglas Jehl.

<P>
   PAYDAY-LOANS (Kokomo, Ind.) _ An unexpected product of the
nation's most prosperous peacetime decade in this century, payday
lending companies are sprouting up all over the country, having
increased in number from 300 seven years ago to nearly 8,000 today.
Operating under names like Check Into Cash, Check 'n Go and Fast
Cash, payday lenders grant loans to workers against their next
paychecks. In return, the companies charge a ``fee,'' typically $15
to $35. At annual rates, the fees normally exceed 300 percent and
400 percent and in some cases they reach four digits. By Peter
Kilborn.

<P>
   BORDER-BABIES (Brownsville, Texas) _ Griselda Vidrio thought
there was something oddly familiar about the smile on the infant a
Honduran woman was clutching in her arms at the Border Patrol's
illegal-alien processing center in Brownsville. Sure enough, when
officials looked into it they discovered that the same baby had
been used as a prop by phony parents on at least three and probably
many more occasions. Smugglers had discovered an inadvertent,
humanitarian loophole in the increasingly difficult game of begging
people across the Rio Grande and into the United States. By Rick
Lyman.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS-EXECUTE (Houston) _ A Canadian man convicted of killing an
elderly woman during a burglary more than 20 years ago faces
execution by injection tonight, despite pleas by Canadian and U.S.
authorities. Joseph Stanley Faulder, 61, would be the first
Canadian executed in the United States since 1952. By Barbara
Whitaker.

</P>
<P>
   3COM-MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ Eric Benhamou, the chief executive
of 3Com, may feel as if he has aged a few years in recent months.
The once ballyhooed company stunned investors with a weak earnings
report in March, and many analysts say it simply has too many
diverse businesses to regain its old momentum, management focus and
reputation as a high-growth company. By Matt Richtel with Seth
Schiesel.
</P>
<P>
   SURVEY-AD-COLUMN (Undated) _ The next phase of a major multiyear

<P>
   BKN-KNICKS-SPURS (San Antonio) _ The Knicks won the first game
of the first three rounds of the NBA playoffs, each time winning on
the road. But they were unable to pull off that same feat against
the San Antonio Spurs, who were the best team in the NBA this
season and looked like the better team in Game 1 of the NBA finals
on Wednesday night. Now the somewhat undermanned and undersized
Knicks have to come up with a plan for Game 2. By Selena Roberts.

   &UR; ENTERTAINMENT (Moved in ``e'' code)  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   PARRISH-EXHIBIT (Philadelphia) _ In 1925, a New York printing
company called the House of Art estimated that one of its
best-selling products, a lithograph of Maxfield Parrish's painting
``Daybreak,'' could be found in one of every four American homes.
Even allowing for a titanic dose of hype, the statistic rings true.
Like apple pie, the flag and indoor plumbing, ``Daybreak'' was,
indeed, an American fixture. So was Parrish himself. He was an art
machine. He turned out countless paintings, many of them intended
for print reproduction. Together, they made him one of the
country's first brand-name artists, and they helped define the mood
and style of an era. ``Maxfield Parrish, 1870-1966,'' which opens
tomorrow at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in
Philadelphia, is a first-time look at the full range of a career
that, almost preposterously, stretched from the post-Victorian
Gilded Age of the 1880s to the Pop world of the 1960s. By Holland
Cotter.
</P>
<P>
   JAZZ-FESTIVAL (New York) _ Take it as coincidence or take it as
synchronicity or take it as one more affirmation of the ways
musicians tune in ideas across boundaries and decades. The JVC Jazz
Festival, which starts its major concerts tonight and runs through
June 27, has two threads that connect its most promising events,
two pervasive influences that should intersect at many different
angles for 10 days. One is the ever-expanding recognition of
Brazilian music, past and present, as more American listeners break
the language barrier and more Brazilian musicians travel
internationally. The second is the lasting influence of Miles
Davis, who spawned entire schools of jazz with each phase of his
music from the 1940s well into the 1970s. By Jon Pareles.

</P>
<P>
   GLASS-WINE (Undated) _ A treasury of priceless glass in a land
of free-flowing wine: how good an idea is this? Good enough, it
turns out, if the combination pairs the strikingly expanded Corning
Museum of Glass in Corning, N.Y., and the vineyard-ringed Finger
Lakes. You can taste your way through dozens of wineries hugging
the hillsides along the sky-blue waters and tour the world's most
comprehensive collection of art glass and high-tech exhibits in a
new section, opening Saturday, of a $62 million glass-sheathed
addition to the museum. (Or more prudently, perhaps, you can do it
the other way around.) By Ralph Blumenthal.

   LOS ANGELES _ It's the state of the Dodgers in which one win has
torched the bullpen and cost them a chance for, can you believe, a
second straight win.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Chan Ho Park pitched well for six innings, but with
the Dodgers trailing by a run, manager Davey Johnson asked Park for
one more inning.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Johnson received one-third of an inning and the
Pittsburgh Pirates received five runs. Math, the Dodgers way, added
up to an 8-3 Pittsburgh win Thursday at Dodger Stadium as the
Pirates won the three-game series in which they scored 24 runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, (Park) ran out of gas at the end, but I wasn't
going to go hurt my bullpen unless we had a lead,'' Johnson said.
``I was hoping he would give me another half-inning or inning, but
he just couldn't do it. I would have liked to hold him after six,
but I figure the way my bullpen was, I'd give him another inning
and the chance for a win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers bullpen is tired because the team used a plethora of
pitchers in splitting the first two games against the Pirates.
Kevin Brown lasted three innings and Carlos Perez followed that
with a 31/3-inning stint. Johnson had to to use five pitchers in
each game.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, Johnson had reason to think Park, who allowed the leadoff
man on in his last five innings, could provide the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   Park was coming off a long rest after serving his seven-game
suspension for his part in a June 5 fight and said he felt strong.
So after throwing 90 pitches in six innings and allowing only a
pair of solo homers to Pittsburgh right fielder Brant Brown, Park
went out in the seventh with the Dodgers trailing 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   He left seven batters later as the Pirates were in the midst of
batting around and scoring five runs. Park's inning began by
allowing a basehit to winning pitcher Kris Benson (5-5) and ended
with a walk to Warren Morris. The Pirates scored two via a Brian
Giles double, one on Jason Kendall's infield single, one when
reliever Doug Bochtler hit Brown with a pitch with the bases
loaded, and another on a fielder's choice as they took a 7-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seventh inning, it was hard, it was tough,'' said Park,
who fell to 4-4 after allowing seven runs on 11 hits. ``The pitcher
got that hit and it made me mad. I was wrong. I thought negative.
It's really hard. I have to believe in myself more. I have to
believe in my teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   It dropped the Dodgers (30-34) to 4-10 in June. They haven't won
back-to-back games since June 4-5 and have lost five of six to the
Pirates this season. Also, Brown remains the only Dodgers starter
to win this month.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also aren't scoring runs early to ease the burden on
the pitchers. Since beating Atlanta two of three games, the Dodgers
have lost 11 of 15. In those 15, they've scored three runs in the
first inning and twice in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, in this three-game series, the Pirates (34-30)
scored five runs in the first and five runs in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offense is not kicking in, the pitching has not (kicked
in),'' said Dodgers center fielder Devon White, who went 2 for 3
with an RBI. ``It's been bad both ways. I don't know what the
solution is. You usually get out of it. Most teams I've been on, we
get out of it. You'd like to see it earlier. People are frustrated.
People are pressing.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Sandy Fletcher, a defensive back from Inglewood
High, has signed a scholarship agreement with USC and will join the
Trojans this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher (6-foot-2, 185 pounds) was a two-sport star at
Inglewood and named most valuable player of the Ocean League in
basketball. He had been recruited by USC for football, and when he
did not sign a basketball letter-of-intent in the spring,
reconsidered playing football for the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   Because he signed after the letter-of-intent period expired,
Fletcher could only sign a scholarship agreement, which does not
bind him to the university.
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher can play safety and is expected to help fill the void
created by the departure of Darnell Lacy, who was academically
disqualified from the university.
</P>
<P>
   Game times set: USC's game against Louisiana Tech will be played
at 3:30 p.m. on Nov. 26 at the Coliseum. It will be televised by
Fox Sports Net. The game had originally been scheduled for Nov. 27
but was changed so that it didn't conflict with USC's basketball
game against Duke in the Wooden Classic.
</P>
<P>
   The only other home-game time set is San Diego State on Sept. 18
at 12:30 p.m. Two road-game kickoff times have been announced:
Notre Dame on Oct. 16 at 11:30 a.m. and Washington State on Nov. 13
at 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Another Haden? Ryan Haden, the son of former USC quarterback Pat
Haden, is considering joining the team as a walk-on. He will enroll
at USC in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Haden played wide receiver at Pasadena Poly, catching 54 passes
for 931 yards and 10 touchdowns.

MCCAIN EMERGING AS CHOICE OF GOP ELITE  
   
   
  
</HEADLINE>
   By CARLA MARINUCCI  
 c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
If George W. Bush, the front-runner for the GOP presidential
nomination, has momentum that political insiders call the ``big
mo,'' then Arizona Senator John McCain has the next best thing: the
buzz.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even as the Texas governor grabs the spotlight, McCain is moving
up in the polls, increasingly viewed as the candidate who may step
out from the GOP pack _ and right into the top spot if Bush fails
to meet expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's every Republican intellectual's choice for the
presidency,'' said Alfred Balitzer, professor of politics at
Claremont-McKenna College and a former Republican pollster. And
more and more of them, he said, are making book on McCain's dark
horse candidacy: ``They're saying he's taken Elizabeth Dole's place
as No. 2, and if Bush falters, he will be the odds-on favorite.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain begins a two-day swing through California Friday, hitting
Silicon Valley for a breakfast with the Technology Network, the
bipartisan high-tech lobbying group, then a roundtable discussion
with reporters. Tomorrow, he'll launch a nationwide youth
leadership campaign at Fort Mason in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe California is the critical state in my campaign,''
McCain said in an interview this week as he prepared for his trip.
When it comes to technology issues, the Arizona Republican argued,
he is the most qualified candidate because of his ``day-to-day,
hands-on involvement'' in issues that matter most in Silicon Valley
_ such as telecommunications reform, Y2K liability, the expansion
of temporary visas for skilled workers, education and charter
schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Al) Gore does have an advantage over me _ I did not invent
the Internet,'' quipped McCain, chairman of the Senate Commerce,
Science and Transportation Committee, referring to a statement the
vice president made during a recent TV interview.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who said he plans to return to California ``for a couple
of weeks'' in August, has already established some serious
credentials in the state. Thursday, he named Dan Schnur, a
respected GOP analyst and former Governor Pete Wilson's spokesman,
as his national campaign spokesman, calling him ``one of the best
strategists in California.''
</P>
<P>
   A Boston Herald poll this week gave McCain a boost; it showed
him drawing even with Elizabeth Dole at 11 points, compared to
Bush's 45.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's head start in the polls and in fund-raising doesn't
bother McCain, who said that ``ultimately, this election is going
to be about who can articulate the vision'' in key issues that
matter to voters.
</P>
<P>
   But he has been helped by a near-constant media presence on the
Kosovo crisis that gave his campaign valuable free exposure,
increased his name recognition and established him as a foreign
policy expert.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's terrific. He had a clear idea of what America's policy
should be in Kosovo, and he stuck with it,'' said Dudley Buffa, who
heads the Lafayette-based Institute for the New California, an
independent think tank that studies political and technology
issues. ``He's demonstrated his complete ability to be
independent.''
</P>
<P>
   That means, Buffa said, that McCain has begun to shape his image
as a reform ``anti-establishment'' candidate _ a role assumed by
challenger Bill Bradley on the Democratic side.
</P>
<P>
   The former Navy pilot and prisoner of war, who was shot down
during the Vietnam War, also has a life story that clearly
distinguishes him from the pack of Republican hopefuls. ``If you
read about what this guy went through, it's hard not to be
impressed,'' said Buffa.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, even the most aggressive Democratic attack dogs
have so far tended to blunt their assaults on McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like McCain, as a Vietnam vet,'' said Bob Mulholland, the
California Democratic campaign adviser who earned a Purple Heart in
Vietnam. ``He went through a very tough time and paid a heavy
personal price. Of all the Republicans, he has the most impressive
resume, having served almost at the cost of his life. But the GOP
will be very tough on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulholland is not alone in suggesting that McCain's success may
depend on the failure of others _ notably Bush, who has so far
grabbed the lion's share of endorsements, money and media
attention. ``If one of the front-runners goes down on the side of
the highway as a corpse, (McCain) will be viable,'' Mulholland
said.
</P>
<P>
   That thinking simply isn't part of the McCain plan, his campaign
insists. ``Everyone's talking about us waiting for George W. Bush
to stumble, but that's not what this campaign's about,'' said
Howard Opinsky, a McCain spokesman, this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a tremendous market for reform in California ... and
John McCain has challenged the status quo,'' Opinsky said. ``It has
cemented his credibility to fight for the change Americans yearn
for.''  &LR;

CANADIAN FIRM SUES CALIFORNIA OVER MTBE  
   
  
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT COLLIER and GLEN MARTIN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
SAN FRANCISCO _ Challenging one of California's newest
environmental protections, a Canadian corporation has filed suit to
overturn the state's ban on the gasoline additive MTBE, calling it
a violation of free-trade rules.
<P>
   Less than three months after Governor Gray Davis moved to end
the use of MTBE, the Vancouver-based Methanex Corp. announced
Tuesday that it is using the North American Free Trade Agreement to
seek $970 million in compensation for lost profits.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge under NAFTA's little-known ``investor rights''
provisions packs a big legal punch. A similar lawsuit filed last
year by a U.S. company forced Canada to overturn its ban on a
gasoline additive that has been implicated in health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Other NAFTA suits are under way in the United States and Canada,
seeking to overturn a wide variety of government regulations.
Consumer and environmentalist groups warn that big business may be
able to use NAFTA to gut decades of progressive legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what `free trade' is all about _ corporations
overruling the decisions made by citizens at the ballot box and the
legislative process,'' said Lori Wallach, director of Public
Citizen's Global Trade Watch, a Washington-based lobbying group
that has fought NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Methanex is using NAFTA to override the governor, state Senate
and people of California,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In papers filed with the U.S. State Department, the company said
California's ban on MTBE unfairly restricts the company's ability
to sell methanol _ a key ingredient in MTBE _ and profit from its
sale in the state. The company says this constitutes a violation of
NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
   MTBE, or methyl tertiary butyl ether, makes gasoline burn more
efficiently and cleanly, and it has been used in most California
cars since 1996 as part of the state's strategy to meet federal
clean-air requirements.
</P>
<P>
   However, the additive, a possible carcinogen, has been
implicated in recent years as a major source of contamination of
both reservoirs and groundwater. And air quality officials have
concluded that the clean-air goals can be met without it.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Davis' March 25 announcement that MTBE will be phased
out by the end of 2002 will cause the company to lose $970 million
in methanol sales over the next 20 years, said Pierre Choquette,CQ &LR; 
Methanex's president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Six percent of world methanol sales occur in California, and
Methanex is the world's largest methanol producer.
</P>
<P>
   Under NAFTA's vaguely written investor rights provisions,
companies are entitled to compensation for ``expropriation'' _
which may be interpreted as any government action, including health
and safety regulations, that has the effect of reducing a company's
profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our claim is related to expropriation,'' Choquette said.
``NAFTA requires that an expropriating party meet certain
obligations, including fair and equitable treatment and the payment
of compensation, which California did not meet.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Seligman, a Sierra Club trade policy specialist, said the
suit has ominous implications for North American environmental
regulations ``because the language of the provisions are so
sweeping. Under NAFTA, this is an open and shut case in favor of
the company. NAFTA states that any regulation tantamount to
expropriation justifies a compensation.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the NAFTA dispute process, lawyers for Methanex and the
U.S. federal government will have two months to reach a settlement.
If they fail to do so, the issue will go to binding arbitration by
a three-person international panel agreed to by both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Although the panel does not have the power to directly overthrow
state or federal laws, it can levy heavy fines _ thus providing
strong pressure for the revocation of the offending law.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a similar NAFTA lawsuit caused Canada to overturn its
ban on MMT, a fuel additive that was blamed for neurological
maladies. The ban was challenged by the Richmond, Va.-based Ethyl
Corp. because it ``expropriated'' future profits and damaged
Ethyl's ``good reputation.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than pay $251 million in damages, Canada overturned its
ban and paid Ethyl $13 million.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bustamante, a spokesman for the governor, said he had
not seen a letter that Methanex said it sent to Davis earlier this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor's decision on MTBE was good for the people and
environment of California,'' Bustamante said. ``He weighed all the
issues, considered all the comments and gave companies sufficient
time to phase out the chemical in a nondisruptive fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Spagnole, a spokesman for the California Environmental
Protection Agency, said the action means little to state regulators
at this point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends on the kind of relief they seek, whether it is
injunctive relief or for damages,'' he said. ``Right now, many
manufacturers are voluntarily choosing not to include MTBE in their
gasoline.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Tahoe Basin (where MTBE contamination of water is
particularly severe), 86 percent of the stations now offer gas with
no MTBE. So, if manufacturers voluntarily elect not to use MTBE,
there are no legal grounds to sue the state or force the federal
government to enjoin the state.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   The comic opera element to Russia's post-bombing dash for Kosovo
_ a wheeze that delighted many Russians and Serbs, even as the 200
troops camped defiantly near Pristina airport had to beg supplies
from the very NATO forces they had wanted to upstage _ should not
obscure the seriousness of the rift between Russia and the West.
</P>
<P>
   That rift was not just over the air war, but over the peace
still to be secured.
</P>
<P>
   Others also opposed NATO's air strikes against the Serbs: China,
India and plenty of smaller countries were alarmed that the West
would resort to force to punish a sovereign government for actions
against its own citizens. But Russia is especially incensed at what
it claims is an attempt to exclude it from influence in an unruly
patch of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Are such charges justified? Russia and China, both veto-wielding
members of the U.N. Security Council, portrayed NATO's decision not
to take the Kosovo issue to the council early on as a cynical ploy
to claim rights of intervention for the West at the expense of the
rest.
</P>
<P>
   But their real gripe is less high-minded.
</P>
<P>
   The rift between the major powers is not so much between those
who want to uphold the principle of U.N. authority and those who do
not. It is between those who believe that Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic had the sovereign right to do what he liked to
the Kosovars, and those who do not.
</P>
<P>
   As countries with a poor record on minority rights _ think of
Chechnya, or Tibet _ Russia and China would have vetoed the use of
force to stop him. It was regrettable, but hardly surprising, given
the scale of the Serbian ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, that such a
split council was bypassed.
</P>
<P>
   If Russia felt excluded from the decision to reverse that ethnic
cleansing, it mostly had itself to blame. Since then, however,
western governments have gone to considerable lengths to bring the
Russians back in.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, many Russians would have liked to support Milosevic,
some just with words, some with weapons. Others may have hesitated
to do so only because Russia is beholden to the West for economic
help.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some Russians _ President Boris Yeltsin still
among them _ who understand that Russia's influence in Europe will
expand only if it works with the European grain, not against it.
</P>
<P>
   They prevailed, and Russia eventually played a useful, if
grudging, role in persuading Milosevic to back down.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that good work, however, may now be undone by Russia's
attempt to obstruct the work of KFOR, the U.N.-mandated but
NATO-led force now trying to restore peace to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than acting like a still-great power, Yeltsin and his
ministers have shown themselves to be in disarray. The West has
played down the dash for Pristina, even though the Russian troops
involved had unilaterally abandoned their peacekeeping duties in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Many East Europeans, however, are alarmed. Russia's demands for
overflight rights to pour in more troops have revived bad memories
of the fist-banging Soviet days.
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense to have Russia involved in policing the Kosovo
peace, if only to reassure the Serbs still in the province of
KFOR's impartiality. And it would be no bad thing for Russian
troops to see at firsthand some of the appalling atrocities their
Serb cousins have perpetrated over the past year. But what Russia's
generals really seem to want is a slice of Kosovo to run as they
see fit.
</P>
<P>
   A deal is being worked on to give Russia a part in KFOR
(something that was anyway always on offer), but it should not
compromise either the unity of KFOR's command or the territorial
integrity of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   And what of the charge that NATO is getting too big for its
military boots?
</P>
<P>
   For an avowedly defensive alliance, the air war against Kosovo
was a startling new departure _ but one that is likely to prove the
exception, not the rule.
</P>
<P>
   NATO encompasses most of the continent's strongest democracies,
which is the best guarantee that, if it acts, it will do so only to
uphold democratic principles, not to trample on them.
</P>
<P>
   And will NATO now feel emboldened to right every wrong? Hardly.
It was scarcely spoiling for a fight with Milosevic, who had
already unleashed two wars _ in Croatia and Bosnia _ before he set
his forces loose in Kosovo. And now that NATO has been through the
experience of fighting a campaign by 19-nation committee, it is
unlikely to rush to repeat it.
</P>
<P>
   This (air-only) war could well have gone badly wrong for NATO.
Moreover, the job of restoring stability to Kosovo will be long and
expensive, as will the reconstruction of the wider region.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty there for Europeans to do _ Russia included _ without
taking on other wars of principle. &QL;

_ a wheeze that delighted many Russians and Serbs, even as the 200
troops camped defiantly near Pristina airport had to beg supplies
from the very NATO forces they had wanted to upstage _ should not
obscure the seriousness of the rift between Russia and the West.
</P>
<P>
   That rift was not just over the air war, but over the peace
still to be secured.
</P>
<P>
   Others also opposed NATO's air strikes against the Serbs: China,
India and plenty of smaller countries were alarmed that the West
would resort to force to punish a sovereign government for actions
against its own citizens. But Russia is especially incensed at what
it claims is an attempt to exclude it from influence in an unruly
patch of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Are such charges justified? Russia and China, both veto-wielding
members of the U.N. Security Council, portrayed NATO's decision not
to take the Kosovo issue to the council early on as a cynical ploy
to claim rights of intervention for the West at the expense of the
rest.
</P>
<P>
   But their real gripe is less high-minded.
</P>
<P>
   The rift between the major powers is not so much between those
who want to uphold the principle of U.N. authority and those who do
not. It is between those who believe that Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic had the sovereign right to do what he liked to
the Kosovars, and those who do not.
</P>
<P>
   As countries with a poor record on minority rights _ think of
Chechnya, or Tibet _ Russia and China would have vetoed the use of
force to stop him. It was regrettable, but hardly surprising, given
the scale of the Serbian ethnic cleansing in Kosovo, that such a
split council was bypassed.
</P>
<P>
   If Russia felt excluded from the decision to reverse that ethnic
cleansing, it mostly had itself to blame. Since then, however,
western governments have gone to considerable lengths to bring the
Russians back in.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, many Russians would have liked to support Milosevic,
some just with words, some with weapons. Others may have hesitated
to do so only because Russia is beholden to the West for economic
help.
</P>
<P>
   But there are some Russians _ President Boris Yeltsin still
among them _ who understand that Russia's influence in Europe will
expand only if it works with the European grain, not against it.
</P>
<P>
   They prevailed, and Russia eventually played a useful, if
grudging, role in persuading Milosevic to back down.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that good work, however, may now be undone by Russia's
attempt to obstruct the work of KFOR, the U.N.-mandated but
NATO-led force now trying to restore peace to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than acting like a still-great power, Yeltsin and his
ministers have shown themselves to be in disarray. The West has
played down the dash for Pristina, even though the Russian troops
involved had unilaterally abandoned their peacekeeping duties in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Many East Europeans, however, are alarmed. Russia's demands for
overflight rights to pour in more troops have revived bad memories
of the fist-banging Soviet days.
</P>
<P>
   It makes sense to have Russia involved in policing the Kosovo
peace, if only to reassure the Serbs still in the province of
KFOR's impartiality. And it would be no bad thing for Russian
troops to see at firsthand some of the appalling atrocities their
Serb cousins have perpetrated over the past year. But what Russia's
generals really seem to want is a slice of Kosovo to run as they
see fit.
</P>
<P>
   A deal is being worked on to give Russia a part in KFOR
(something that was anyway always on offer), but it should not
compromise either the unity of KFOR's command or the territorial
integrity of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   And what of the charge that NATO is getting too big for its
military boots?
</P>
<P>
   For an avowedly defensive alliance, the air war against Kosovo
was a startling new departure _ but one that is likely to prove the
exception, not the rule.
</P>
<P>
   NATO encompasses most of the continent's strongest democracies,
which is the best guarantee that, if it acts, it will do so only to
uphold democratic principles, not to trample on them.
</P>
<P>
   And will NATO now feel emboldened to right every wrong? Hardly.
It was scarcely spoiling for a fight with Milosevic, who had
already unleashed two wars _ in Croatia and Bosnia _ before he set
his forces loose in Kosovo. And now that NATO has been through the
experience of fighting a campaign by 19-nation committee, it is
unlikely to rush to repeat it.
</P>
<P>
   This (air-only) war could well have gone badly wrong for NATO.
Moreover, the job of restoring stability to Kosovo will be long and
expensive, as will the reconstruction of the wider region.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty there for Europeans to do _ Russia included _ without
taking on other wars of principle. &QL;

<P>
   Those Americans who hope that their ``Goldilocks'' economy
(neither too hot nor too cold) will last forever will have been
delighted by this week's figures showing that, after a sharp jump
in April, consumer prices were virtually unchanged in May.
</P>
<P>
   They may have concluded that the Federal Reserve does not, after
all, need to raise interest rates at its next policy meeting on
June 30. Investors duly pushed the stock market up.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Goldilocks is still in grave danger: there are clear signs
that the American economy is getting too hot.
</P>
<P>
   At its May meeting, the Fed's open-market committee (i.e., its
monetary-policy board) decided against a rise in rates but adopted
a ``bias to tighten'' _ presumably, if future evidence confirmed
that inflation was rising.
</P>
<P>
   The latest numbers might suggest that they were wise to wait.
</P>
<P>
   Even after stripping out volatile food and energy prices,
America's core rate of inflation was 2.0 percent in the 12 months
to May, slightly less than a year ago. However, monetary policy
must be forward-looking, and other factors signal that a rise in
interest rates remains overdue.
</P>
<P>
   First, America's domestic demand continues to grow at an
unsustainable pace. Retail sales, for example, rose by almost 8
percent in the 12 months to May, far more than had been expected.
</P>
<P>
   America's spending spree is being financed by heavy borrowing by
both households and firms, whose debts are growing at their fastest
rate for a decade. Consumer debt is at record levels relative to
income; firms are issuing huge amounts of debt to buy back shares.
</P>
<P>
   Second, although it is possible that faster productivity growth
is allowing the economy to grow safely at a faster pace, the fall
in unemployment, to a 30-year low of 4.2 percent, suggests that the
productivity gains have not been large enough for that.
</P>
<P>
   America's labor market looks dangerously tight, with increasing
reports of labor shortages. If unemployment falls further, wages
are bound to accelerate.
</P>
<P>
   All the evidence points to overheating: an overvalued stock
market, as well as the consumer-spending spree, borrowing binge and
incipient labor shortages.
</P>
<P>
   American policymakers have long warned the rest of the world
against such excesses; so why has the Fed been so slow to respond?
</P>
<P>
   One excuse may have been the fragile state of the rest of the
world economy. Fears of a world recession following Russia's
default last autumn prompted the Fed to cut interest rates three
times, by a total of three-quarters of a percentage point.
</P>
<P>
   But today the world economy looks healthier. Not only have
emerging economies in East Asia and Brazil picked up sooner than
expected, but also, over the past month, the news from other rich
economies has turned slightly cheerier.
</P>
<P>
   After five quarters of decline, Japan's GDP rose at an annual
rate of 7.9 percent in the first quarter. This figure is distorted
by special factors; GDP may dip back in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's economy is certainly not about to lurch from bust to
boom; indeed it could yet lurch downwards again. But it is at least
possible that the worst may now be over.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Europe's economies may be less frail than had been
feared: both Britain and Germany, after flirting with recession,
seem to have escaped it.
</P>
<P>
   That commentators greeted a feeble 0.7 percent growth in
Germany's GDP in the year to March as ``good news'' says much about
their expectations, but if the German economy is looking less weak
than it was, that strengthens the case for the Fed to start
reversing last year's easing.
</P>
<P>
   By raising rates now, the Fed could ensure that inflation
remains fairly low. It would also usefully remind investors that
interest rates can rise _ and that shares are not a sure one-way
bet.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving rates unchanged, on the other hand, would continue
dangerously to fuel both the stock market and the consumer-spending
boom.
</P>
<P>
   Americans like happy endings. Unfortunately, they seem to have
forgotten the conclusion of the Goldilocks story: the bears chased
her away. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Two men stand on a stage. One is the hulking figure of Willy
Loman, gradually becoming smaller in front of the audience's eyes;
the other is his younger and weedier boss, Howard, gradually
downsizing his old employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't eat an orange and throw the peel away,'' roars the
broken salesman. ``A man is not a piece of fruit.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Howard patronizes the old man (who decades before had
helped christen him) by calling him ``kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the muffled sobs from the audience during the current,
heavily Tony-ed version of ``Death of a Salesman'' on Broadway
occur during the final reconciliation between Willy and his useless
son, Biff. But the moment when Howard sacks Willy still stands out
in its viciousness.
</P>
<P>
   When Arthur Miller's play opened in 1949, one conservative
critic called it ``a time bomb expertly placed under the edifice of
Americanism.''
</P>
<P>
   Willy Loman, the relentless competitor, became a symbol of the
dark side of the American Dream that he so firmly believed in.
</P>
<P>
   As his wife, Linda, says to Biff: ``He's not the finest
character that ever lived. But he's a human being and a terrible
thing is happening to him. So attention must be paid.''
</P>
<P>
   But who is paying attention now? At first sight it seems odd
that New Yorkers are flocking to see such a depressing play.
</P>
<P>
   Figures for consumer confidence are sky-high, unemployment at a
29-year low. When people lose their jobs they find new ones pretty
quickly. During the interval, young investment bankers sip
champagne and express their astonishment that America could ever
have been ``like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The most modern figure in the play seems to be the ghost of
Willy's brother Ben _ an early version of an Internet entrepreneur
who keeps on telling his brother how he ``walked into the jungle''
at 17, walked out at 21, and ``by God, I was rich.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow America's chattering classes seem to have forgotten the
much-ballyhooed age of uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Those days in the early 1990s, when the New York Times seemed to
have a permanent section on insecurity in the workplace and George
Bush senior was wandering around New Hampshire mumbling ``Message:
I care'' to laid-off workers, seem almost as distant as the days
when salesmen still wore hats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current election will be about health care, education,
values,'' one senator says, echoing the views of pollsters.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether her boyfriend, who makes his living selling
T-shirt logos around the country, feels insecure, Carol, a fitness
instructor who works just round the corner from the Eugene O' Neill
Theatre, says flatly: ``How should I know? He's playing golf in
Myrtle Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the notion that Willy Loman has left the American political
scene for the 19th hole in the Carolinas is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   To make the obvious point first, as Alan Greenspan, the chairman
of the Fed, made it to Congress this week, ``The rate of growth
cannot increase indefinitely.''
</P>
<P>
   A nasty stock market correction and slightly higher interest
rates, and many families across America could be looking at their
Visa and MasterCard bills in the same anxious way that the Lomans
fret about the payments on the fridge.
</P>
<P>
   A cyclical downturn would certainly push Willy back to
center-stage.
</P>
<P>
   But the salesman's tragedy was set at the start of America's
postwar boom. As Greenspan has pointed out repeatedly, one reason
why wage inflation remains relatively low is the simple fact that
many Americans are terrified of losing their jobs. And with good
reason.
</P>
<P>
   Some 55,231 jobs were shed in May, according to consultants at
Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas. The total for job cuts in the first
five months of 1999 was nearly 50 percent higher than the
equivalent figure in 1998. The typical worker changes jobs nine
times before the age of 32.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any Monday morning you can be told you are no longer needed,''
Miller recently told the Los Angeles Times. ``The company is moving
to Guatemala.''
</P>
<P>
   If you pick up any book about the Internet, you will be told
that ``salesmen'' are the next class of people to be
``disintermediated.'' Instead of sending out Willy and his
suitcase, Howard would only need to set up a website.
</P>
<P>
   Unsurprisingly, the long-term structural trends about insecurity
are all up.
</P>
<P>
   One poll earlier this year of 500,000 workers showed anxiety
about jobs to be three times higher than it was during the 1980-81
recession. And men of Willy's age seem particularly vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   John Schmitt at the Economic Policy Institute points out that if
you exclude women (whose careers have become slightly more secure),
many of the standard insecurity measures are still worsening.
</P>
<P>
   Even if jobs are easy to find, it is hard to take your pension
and health care with you. And the older you get, the less likely
you are to want to move in search of work.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it just a matter of losing your job; the problem lies in
the whole stress-producing environment of modern corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   Miller once thought of calling his play ``The Inside of His
Head.'' It is easy to imagine a modern Willy Loman bemoaning the
passing of seniority, being tormented by group evaluation sessions
and spending half his day arguing with his HMO.
</P>
<P>
   Even Carol, the Manhattan fitness instructor, complains that her
job is now judged on the basis of salesmanship as well as muscle
tone.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody in America, it often seems these days, is on
commission and on trial.
</P>
<P>
   And so, in many ways, they should be. Every country in Europe
would kill to have a capitalism that spits out inefficient people
like Willy as ruthlessly as America does.
</P>
<P>
   Willy's frantic desire to compete, his merry recital of the
management cliches of the day (``It's not what you sell; it's how
you sell''), his determination to imitate the legendary Bill: all
these things are what keeps America ahead of its peers. &QL;

   DES MOINES, IOWA AND CARTHAGE, TENN. _ The curtain is up in the
political theatre of America's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   One protagonist, Al Gore, delivers his polished monologue before
an old-fashioned rally in the main street of his hometown in
Tennessee, backed by the red-brick wall of the Smith County
courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   The other, George W. Bush, stands relaxed amid the hay bales of
Iowa, hesitating a little over his speech. Behind him, the Iowa
cornfields stretch into infinity, an image _ his campaign managers
hope _ of American plenty and potential (for this is June and the
corn is only as high as an elephant's thigh).
</P>
<P>
   But the speech is the same: I am running for president.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, barring upsets, these two announcements will mark
the start of the presidential campaign for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   It is exceptionally early. At this stage in the contest of 1988,
the presidential aspirants were busy attacking rivals within their
own parties. This time, the electoral timetable is foreshortened.
</P>
<P>
   Now that two giant states, California and New York, have moved
forward primary elections to choose the presidential nominees, the
primary season will effectively be over in March. This means it has
been vital to raise a lot of money early.
</P>
<P>
   Those without money are falling behind; those with it are
already running campaigns not for the leadership of their party,
but of the country.
</P>
<P>
   There is a deeper comparison to be made with the election of
1988. That vote took place against the background of a long
economic expansion, the Reagan boom.
</P>
<P>
   It pitted an incumbent vice president, dull alongside his
charismatic boss, against a governor from a large, successful state
who was regarded by his own party as a moderate. And at this point
in the process, the challenger, Michael Dukakis of Massachusetts,
was far ahead in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   There is a twist to this comparison, of course: the candidate
called George Bush was then the trailing incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   For Al Gore, the comparison is heartening. The main question of
this campaign will be the role played in it by the economic
expansion of the past six years.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's central claim to the presidency is that since the
Democrats gained the White House in 1992, the economy has put on an
extraordinary performance. At the start of next year, assuming it
continues, the boom will have become the longest in America's
history.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation has fallen from 7 percent a year to about 2 percent;
the Dow Jones Industrial Average has risen from 3,300 to over
10,000.
</P>
<P>
   In the speech announcing his candidacy, Gore boasted of the 19
million new jobs created during his term in office, and of the
transformation of the federal budget position from record deficit
to record surplus.
</P>
<P>
   It is an immensely powerful appeal (even if the administration
can claim only a small part of the real credit).
</P>
<P>
   Bush can only reply that prosperity isn't everything:
``Prosperity must have a purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   The force of the appeal has not been tested yet in the public
arena. If the election does prove a referendum on economic
competence, then the huge lead George W. now enjoys in the opinion
polls could well vanish _ as did Dukakis's, though for a whole
bundle of reasons _ and Gore will emulate the feat of President
George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Gore may be a stronger candidate than Bush senior
was. He is now in Clinton's shadow, but his party's nomination will
make him the Democrats' central political figure.
</P>
<P>
   And though his dull reputation belies it, he is a tough
campaigner. In 1988 it was he, then a Democratic rival to Dukakis,
who first brought up the charge that Bush subsequently used to
devastating effect: that Dukakis had temporarily released a rapist
and murderer, Willie Horton, who had murdered again while on
furlough.
</P>
<P>
   And it was Gore who, in 1994, had the task of debating free
trade with the independent candidate, Ross Perot, whose
protectionist message was proving attractive. Gore wiped the floor
with him.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning toughness is likely to be vital in this election.
Because there is little to choose between the two candidates'
ideologies, simple gaffes are likely to play an even more important
role than usual.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush's campaigning toughness has not yet been tested by
anything as fierce as a presidential campaign. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 275 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 750) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gore has a third advantage over Bush. This election is likely to
be fought at the center ground of politics, as most elections are
when a country is prosperous.
</P>
<P>
   Gore not only already occupies the middle (because Clinton has
moved the Democratic Party there), but he is also unlikely to be
knocked from that position during the primary contest with his
challenger, Bill Bradley. Bradley, too, is a centrist.
</P>
<P>
   This is not true of Bush. During the primary season, all his
main challengers will come from the right.
</P>
<P>
   Republican conservatives do not have the influence they once
wielded. They have too many rival leaders, most of whom could not
win a race even if they were the only candidates.
</P>
<P>
   All the same, the conservatives still represent about a quarter
of voters in the primary contests. At some point, Bush will have to
confront them if he is to contest the center ground with Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is already trying to distance himself: his campaign slogan,
``compassionate conservatism,'' is a clever marketing ploy to be
conservative without looking like Genghis Khan.
</P>
<P>
   He has said that, as president, he would make judicial
appointments without requiring judges to, for example, oppose
abortion in advance (the choice of Supreme Court judges will be one
of the most important jobs of the next president: several posts are
likely to come up soon).
</P>
<P>
   But this is only a start. Gore is already attacking his rival
for being a captive of the right. Bush's ability to distance
himself from conservatives without alienating the base of
Republican support will be one of the biggest challenges of his
campaign. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If an American Edmund Clerihew Bentley were writing the Gore
campaign slogan, it would be: Al's a pal. But George the Second
ain't what he's reckoned.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, the balance of advantage lies with Gore. But the
comparison with the 1988 contest suggests this race is more evenly
balanced. For a start, George W. is more ``presidential'' than
Dukakis was _ and at least as much as Al Gore is.
</P>
<P>
   The two men are strikingly similar in background. Both are
scions of America's political aristocracy: Bush the son of a former
president, Gore the son of a Tennessee senator. (This, by the way,
is not unusual: the race includes the wife of a former Senate
leader and the son of a millionaire publisher: name recognition
appears to be helpful.)
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, with a president and two state governors in the family,
the Bushes are on their way to becoming the Kennedys of the
Republican party, though without the glamor.
</P>
<P>
   What is more striking is that both men are making the same
pitch. Both visit mission schools and praise ``faith-based
organizations.'' Both sprinkle their speeches with Spanish
soundbites.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says: ``We must pass this message to our children _ teach
them there are right choices in life and wrong choices. Changing
our culture requires more than laws.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, in the version according to Gore: ``If children aren't
taught right from wrong, no new government program will staunch
that decay.''
</P>
<P>
   Platitudinous, of course, but the same platitude. Sometimes, it
is hard to tell Gush from Bore. &QL;

<P>
   More important, Clinton's legacy will be more of a mixed
blessing to his vice-president than Ronald Reagan's was to his. It
is true that the dog days of the Reagan presidency were
overshadowed by the Iran-Contra scandal. But the impact of the
Monica Lewinsky impeachment has been far more damaging.
</P>
<P>
   Americans may be content with the state of the economy and
(since peace broke out in Kosovo) the world. But contentment may
not translate into support for the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive political indicators are moving against Gore. One of
the best is a poll that asks whether people think the country is
moving the right way or the wrong way. This is at its lowest point
since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's personal favorability rating is below 50 percent for
the first time in his second term. It may be that the
administration is not being credited for the economic boom, or that
contentment is simply taking the economy out of people's
calculations. Either way, the numbers are ominous for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, he is more unpopular than was Bush senior
at the comparable point in his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   To voters, Gore seems hard to like. He lacks the common touch.
He has been consistently less popular than Clinton, even at the
depths of public disgust with the president. Since this is so, even
his attempts to distance himself are not particularly helpful.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign announcement, complete with brass bands and country
music, generated plenty of noise. But it surrounded him, rather
than focused on him.
</P>
<P>
   George W., in contrast, seems more at ease. At his campaign
announcement, he mingled and shook hands. His smile does not seem
nailed on.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's a bore. But George W. won't trouble you. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Ernest Hemingway once noted that there is no hunting
like the hunting of a man, and those who have hunted armed men long
enough never care for anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the life of American bounty hunters, people who track
down fugitives from the law and are paid only when they get their
man.
</P>
<P>
   Bounty hunters are often thought to be almost as nefarious as
the felons they hunt, but a recent article by John Chamberlin in
the University of Illinois Law Review argues that bail-enforcement
agents (as bounty hunters prefer to be called) play an important
role in the criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Around 35,000 defendants jump bail every year in America, and a
remarkable four out of five are brought back to justice by bounty
hunters.
</P>
<P>
   Bounty hunters typically work for a bail bondsman, an individual
or firm that lends bail money to defendants awaiting trial (for a
hefty fee, of course). If the defendant skips his court appearance,
as roughly one in seven clients do, then the loan is put at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the bounty hunter, who is typically paid 10 percent of the
bail amount if he can catch and return the fugitive within a
predetermined period of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are to the police what FedEx is to the post office,'' says
Bob Burton, director of the National Institute of Bail Enforcement
(and technical adviser to Robert de Niro on the film ``Midnight
Run'').
</P>
<P>
   Burton boasts that bounty hunters, responding to
``private-sector incentives,'' have a higher success rate than any
law-enforcement organization in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlin uses assorted Department of Justice statistics to
make the case that the country's estimated 7,000 bounty hunters are
very good at what they do. In fact, they are significantly better
than traditional law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, defendants under the supervision of a bondsman
were more likely to show up in court (85 percent) than all other
released felony defendants, even those who paid their own bail (78
percent).
</P>
<P>
   And when defendants failed to appear in court, those who were
the responsibility of a bondsman were more likely to be returned to
the court (80 percent) than were those who had posted their own
bail and were tracked down by ordinary police (64 percent).
</P>
<P>
   How does a bounty hunter get his quarry? ``Most of the fugitives
are pretty stupid,'' says Burton, who made his first bail arrest in
1959 and now teaches a three-day certification course for
prospective bounty hunters. (The course is strictly voluntary, and
mostly tells a bounty hunter how not to get arrested, plus a few
subtle tricks of the trade.)
</P>
<P>
   A bounty hunter may well find the fugitive watching television
at his girlfriend's house, he says. But the clever hunter may also
set a trap.
</P>
<P>
   One effective ploy is a letter to the fugitive's family from
some bogus organization promising to erase the charges if the
defendant calls a special toll-free number. When the call comes in,
the number is traced and the bounty hunter pounces.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatively, the bounty hunter may probe family and friends
for a Judas. A well-intentioned spouse or parent may think the
fugitive will be safer in custody; a colleague with less pure
motives might provide valuable information when money is offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you take ten people in your life, three love you, three
hate you, and four don't give a damn,'' reflects Burton. ``Someone
will give you up for love or money.''
</P>
<P>
   But bounty hunters have more power than the police, with far
less training and accountability.
</P>
<P>
   A bounty hunter can enter or break into a fugitive's house
without a warrant, pursue a fugitive across state lines without
worrying about extradition, and arrest, detain and transport a
fugitive without many of the restrictions placed on ordinary
law-enforcement officials by the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   These powers are not granted by the state; they emanate from the
private contract between the bondsman and the defendant.
</P>
<P>
   The courts have consistently found that bond is an extension of
jail; the bondsman, and the bounty hunter as his agent, have the
same powers as a jailer to control the movements of a defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Bounty hunters are also virtually unregulated. In most states,
the job requires no qualifications, no training, no background
check, and no license of any sort.
</P>
<P>
   The result, critics say, is that incompetent or brutal bounty
hunters can abuse defendants in their custody or harm innocents.
</P>
<P>
   They can be sued or arrested if things go terribly wrong, but
juries are not sympathetic to injured fugitives and innocents may
find that there is not much to recover from an uninsured bounty
hunter, no matter how egregious the offense.
</P>
<P>
   The call for reform reached a crescendo in 1997 after a group of
masked, heavily armed bounty hunters supposedly broke into the
wrong house in Arizona and shot two people dead. (Prosecutors later
claimed that the men were merely posing as bounty hunters in order
to rob the house.)
</P>
<P>
   Reformers have advocated making bounty hunters subject to the
same constitutional restrictions as the police, or even eliminating
the commercial bail-bond industry altogether, as three states,
including Illinois, have already done.
</P>
<P>
   Both those options are unwise, argues Chamberlin. Curbing the
powers of bounty hunters would make them significantly less
effective and would probably be challenged in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Getting rid of commercial bondsmen would leave more defendants
awaiting trial in jail at a time when prisons are already
overcrowded.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Chamberlin reckons that the states ought to license
bounty hunters and demand some minimum level of competence.
</P>
<P>
   This would upgrade the quality of the profession without
hampering a bounty hunter's ability to find and return fugitives _
and without much altering one of the most attractive aspects of the
system, that it costs taxpayers nothing. &QL;

<P>
   CHICAGO _ Ernest Hemingway once noted that there is no hunting
like the hunting of a man, and those who have hunted armed men long
enough never care for anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the life of American bounty hunters, people who track
down fugitives from the law and are paid only when they get their
man.
</P>
<P>
   Bounty hunters are often thought to be almost as nefarious as
the felons they hunt, but a recent article by John Chamberlin in
the University of Illinois Law Review argues that bail-enforcement
agents (as bounty hunters prefer to be called) play an important
role in the criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Around 35,000 defendants jump bail every year in America, and a
remarkable four out of five are brought back to justice by bounty
hunters.
</P>
<P>
   Bounty hunters typically work for a bail bondsman, an individual
or firm that lends bail money to defendants awaiting trial (for a
hefty fee, of course). If the defendant skips his court appearance,
as roughly one in seven clients do, then the loan is put at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the bounty hunter, who is typically paid 10 percent of the
bail amount if he can catch and return the fugitive within a
predetermined period of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are to the police what FedEx is to the post office,'' says
Bob Burton, director of the National Institute of Bail Enforcement
(and technical adviser to Robert de Niro on the film ``Midnight
Run'').
</P>
<P>
   Burton boasts that bounty hunters, responding to
``private-sector incentives,'' have a higher success rate than any
law-enforcement organization in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlin uses assorted Department of Justice statistics to
make the case that the country's estimated 7,000 bounty hunters are
very good at what they do. In fact, they are significantly better
than traditional law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, defendants under the supervision of a bondsman
were more likely to show up in court (85 percent) than all other
released felony defendants, even those who paid their own bail (78
percent).
</P>
<P>
   And when defendants failed to appear in court, those who were
the responsibility of a bondsman were more likely to be returned to
the court (80 percent) than were those who had posted their own
bail and were tracked down by ordinary police (64 percent).
</P>

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ For the past three decades, Mexico's six-yearly
change of president has been presaged or followed by upheaval,
either political or economic.
</P>
<P>
   The last occasion, in 1994, saw plenty of both: a guerrilla
uprising in Chiapas, the murder of both the presidential candidate
and the secretary-general of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary
Party (PRI), and then an economic collapse from which the country
is still recovering.
</P>
<P>
   This time will be different, President Ernesto Zedillo's
government has vowed.
</P>
<P>
   The election is still a year away. Yet for those fearing fresh
intrigue or fragility, recent events have not exactly been soothing
_ and not just this week's earthquake, whose tremors terrified
southern and central Mexico and killed 18 people.
</P>
<P>
   First, newspaper reports in the United States claimed that the
authorities there suspect links to the drug trade by both Zedillo's
chief of staff, Liebano Saenz, and Carlos Hank Gonzalez, a
billionaire businessman and former cabinet minister (both deny the
charges).
</P>
<P>
   Then Francisco ``Paco'' Stanley, a popular television presenter,
was shot dead in his car in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   His colleagues in Mexico's television stations, known for their
PRI loyalty, raged at the city's chronically high crime rate and at
its mayor, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the most likely presidential
candidate of the opposition Party of the Democratic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   They soon stopped: it emerged that the hapless Stanley had been
carrying cocaine and bore the marks of a habitual drug user. His
death resembled a mob execution, not a common murder.
</P>
<P>
   The next furore involved Carlos Cabal Peniche, a Mexican banker
trying to avoid extradition from Australia for bank fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Last week he said that he had channelled $25 million in
donations to the PRI, some of it for Zedillo's presidential
campaign (though whether that was illegal under the fast-and-loose
electoral rules of the time is not clear).
</P>
<P>
   And then came Carlos Salinas, Zedillo's predecessor. Shortly
after his term ended, Salinas slunk into exile, as the economy
collapsed and his brother Raul was arrested on suspicion of
planning one of the previous year's political murders (he was found
guilty in January this year).
</P>
<P>
   Though rumored to have made secret visits, he had not been seen
publicly on Mexican soil since 1995 _ until his 48-hour stopover
last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Supposedly, this was only to see his sick father, his jailed
brother and his graduating son. But journalists invited for coffee
and exclusive chats with the ex-president at his boyhood home
turned up to find the place bursting.
</P>
<P>
   Salinas used the opportunity to repeat his well-worn insistence
that the economic crisis was not his fault, despite the belief of
most Mexicans that it was.
</P>
<P>
   By his denial of responsibility, he implied that the blame was
Zedillo's, who instead of counterattacking kept quiet.
</P>
<P>
   That, says Jorge Castaneda, a political scientist, suggests this
is a discussion that Zedillo does not, for some reason, want to
have _ a victory, however small, for Salinas.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But Zedillo has been busy ensuring that he does not end
up as reviled as his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   Next year Mexico's economy will be much more strongly placed
than it was in 1994, with less debt falling due, a smaller
current-account deficit, and a floating currency instead of a fixed
one. These should ensure there is no repeat of the capital flight
and eventual devaluation of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But, this being Mexico, further intrigue seems certain between
now and the election, and investors may yet be scared into staying
away.
</P>
<P>
   So the government is taking no chances. This week it announced
that it was asking the IMF for a $4.2 billion standby credit which,
together with existing loan agreements and contingency facilities,
would mean that it could call on $24 billion in loans over the next
18 months if it really needed to.
</P>
<P>
   That, economists say, should cover it in the worst of
circumstances. Except, perhaps, an even stronger earthquake. &QL;

   PARIS AND NEW YORK _ This week the world's most famous consumer
brand became embroiled in its worst-ever health scare, when around
100 people in Belgium, many of them children, and 88 people in
France suffered nausea, headaches and diarrhea, some of them
seriously enough to be admitted to hospital.
</P>
<P>
   On June 14 Coca-Cola's soft drinks were banned in Belgium.
Luxembourg and France followed suit, and the firm itself eventually
withdrew its products from the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola seemingly forgot the cardinal rule of crisis
management _ to act fast, tell the whole truth and look as if you
have nothing to hide.
</P>
<P>
   Coke cannot seem to do anything right at the moment. The
American giant's ambitious plans for expansion have already
strained relations with governments in several European countries.
</P>
<P>
   Its attempt to buy the international soft-drinks brands of
Cadbury Schweppes was slapped down by several regulators and scaled
back. It is still trying to overcome objections to its purchase of
Orangina in France.
</P>
<P>
   Nor has Coke done much to please investors recently, with its
failure to increase either volumes or its share price as fast as
might have been expected in the bull market.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing the company needed was what Jennifer Solomon, a
drinks analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, calls ``a public-relations
nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   The first sufferers fell sick as early as May 20. They later
reported that their drinks smelt funny and tasted unusually sharp.
</P>
<P>
   Only now has Coke identified what was wrong _ two separate
failures in its huge bottling system, which is controlled in
Belgium by Coca-Cola Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   As the firm eventually explained, those who fell ill were
victims of some ``bad'' carbon dioxide used in a batch of bottled
Coca-Cola at a factory in Antwerp, near the Dutch border. The
company voluntarily withdrew all bottles with defective gas.
</P>
<P>
   The second problem affected canned drinks from a plant in
Dunkirk, across the border in France. The outside of some cans from
this plant, which supplies two-thirds of Coke's products drunk in
Belgium, as well as much of the French market, appeared to have
picked up traces of a fungicide used to treat the wooden pallets on
which packages of cans are moved around.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's public-relations error is to have seemed keener to
protect its own back than to allay the understandable fears of
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Coming soon after Belgians had suffered from a food scandal
involving contaminated meat, the firm's legal-sounding insistence
that there were ``no health or safety issues,'' and that the drinks
``might make you feel sick, but are not harmful'' were hardly going
to reassure people.
</P>
<P>
   One crisis-management specialist argues that, although Coca-Cola
is right to worry about being sued in the long term, it could
suffer just as much from any unfavorable judgments that consumers
form about the drink right now.
</P>
<P>
   A statement on June 16 from Douglas Ivester, the firm's
chairman, expressing his ``regret,'' arrived hopelessly late.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Coca-Cola's brand is unlikely to suffer the damage
that, say, Perrier sustained when in 1990 the French group was
forced to recall every bottle of its sparkling water, after some
had been contaminated by traces of benzene.
</P>
<P>
   As Raymond Perrier (sic) at Interbrand, Newell &AMP; Sorrell, a
London-based brand consultant, points out: ``The image consumers
had of peasants filling empty bottles from gushing springs was
destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, there is no doubt in people's minds that Coke is
entirely artificial. And, fortunately, it hasn't killed anyone,
unlike a batch of Johnson &AMP; Johnson's Tylenol tablets that had been
tampered with.
</P>
<P>
   However, Coca-Cola has made a big mess of what should have been
a small public-relations problem. That looks clumsy from the
guardians of the world's best-known brand. &QL;

 &HT;    NEW SMITHSONIAN EXHIBIT DISPLAYS EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN
 &HT;    Repeating in (w) Washington and (l) lifestyle categories for all
needing.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Here comes the sun.
</P>
<P>
   The Smithsonian Institution this week unveils a unique traveling
exhibition of solar devices intended to show that virtually
anything under the sun can be powered by its rays.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition, a showcase for solar design innovations, is
beginning a two-year national tour that will take it to Atlanta,
Houston, Los Angeles, Phoenix and Chicago. Dates for the visits
have not yet been set.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of the exhibit is to demonstrate how easily we can
generate plenty of power featuring the sun,'' said Lucy Fellowes,
curator and project director of the Smithsonian-affiliated
Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, an organizer of the exhibit
with the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service.
</P>
<P>
   Although President Clinton has pointed to solar energy as one
answer to the problem of global warming, critics say federal policy
has been less than vigorous in promoting the alternative to fossil
energy sources, which contribute to the ``greenhouse effect'' by
pumping tons of heat-trapping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton announced a ``Million Solar Roofs Initiative'' in 1997
and set a national goal of increasing the number of solar electric
panels and heat collectors. To stimulate the trend, the president
said the government would make a ``down payment'' by installing
20,000 solar systems on federal buildings by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States programs are strongest in title, not in
implementation,'' said Seth Dunn, a research associate at
Worldwatch Institute, a natural resources think tank in Washington.
``The government has sort of taken baby steps. There have been
serious cutbacks in funding, and most of the innovation is at the
state level.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunn pointed to some state policies that encourage use of solar
energy, such as ``net metering,'' which allows solar homeowners to
sell excess electricity back to power companies.
</P>
<P>
   Less than one percent of the country's energy budget is provided
by solar power, said Kert Davies, science policy director at Ozone
Action, an environmental group. He said other countries are moving
to solar energy much faster. Japan, for example, already has
``millions'' of rooftop solar units.
</P>
<P>
   The Worldwatch ``State of the World'' report for 1999 noted that
between 1990 and 1997, worldwide use of solar power to generate
electricity grew by an annual rate of 16.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Smithsonian display _ it's titled ``Under the Sun: An
Outdoor Exhibit of Light'' _ is sponsored and funded by the U.S.
Department of Energy and BP Solarex, the world's largest solar
energy manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   Exploring the relationship of the sun and Earth, it illustrates
the usefulness of photovoltaic cells, which convert sunlight to
electricity. ``Under the Sun'' examines the various ways that solar
energy can be used in everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   Among the solar-powered items on display:
</P>
<P>
   _ A garden chair with a photovoltaic-powered overhead light that
is designed for reading under the stars.
</P>
<P>
   A solar-powered lawn mower that can cover 13,000 square feet in
the course of a growing season. It's equipped with an edge sensor,
a personal activation code, an impact detector, a theft alarm and a
communications system to keep it on track _ all powered by the sun.
</P>
<P>
   _ A ``portable energy system'' that uses direct or indirect
sunlight to power and charge battery operated devices. It can
double the operating time of a laptop computer, for example.
</P>
<P>
   _ A solar cooker, which can help the estimated 1.5 billion
people who live in areas of the world where fuel wood is scarce. In
sunny areas, a family dependant on wood fuel can save about 30
percent of its annual wood consumption by using a solar cooker, the
Smithsonian says.
</P>
<P>
   _ A solar-powered fountain where the flow of its water is
determined by the intensity of the sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   _ A solar pavilion made of a thin film of photovoltaic glass
that generates enough electricity to power its own night lighting
and ventilation systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Smithsonian says all of the items on display are
consumer-friendly and sensitive to the environment. Fellowes said
many of the items _ sun-powered lanterns, a clock and sundial,
garden lights, solar cookers and portable energy systems, for
instance _ already can be purchased at hardware stores, on the
Internet or through catalogues.
</P>
<P>
   In creating the exhibition, she said the National Design Museum
felt it was important to remain true to its mission of celebrating
the direct impact of design on daily life. ``It made sense to us to
look at energy, renewable energy from the sun,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Design Museum's layout provided an attractive
setting for the exhibit, which opened in New York City last summer,
designed by architects Nicholas Goldsmith and Gregory Kiss.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became an exhibition on generating energy in our own
backyard. We had the opportunity to use our garden as features and
setting. The design used all features of the garden _ our green
space, trees, the museum's facade,'' Fellowes said. ``It was an
outdoor environment powered by the sun.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellowes said the sponsors were so enthusiastic about ``Under
the Sun'' when it opened that they wanted it to go on tour. The
Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service worked with
them to develop a mobile version. For the national tour, Fellowes
said it was important to have a good geographic distribution and
one that would also allow the exhibit to ``follow the sun.'' The
final itinerary has not yet been determined.
</P>
<P>
   Fellowes said she was intrigued by the materials and strategies
that were used to generate electricity in the exhibit when it
opened.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reaction was one of sheer exhilaration,'' she said. ``It
was beautiful night and day and it worked!''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the individual displays, she said, ``It's hard to
pick favorites.'' However, she said visitors should take care to
note that the exhibition is entirely self-powered, which she said
is its most appealing aspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the essence of design _ how to make something work,''
she said.

   The fact that the Internet will make life better for all
humankind has long been noted, even on the East Coast. What seems
to have struck the East Coast only recently is that the Internet is
making a smaller subset of all humankind--people who start
Internet-related companies or join them before they go
public--incredibly wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times reported as much on its front page recently,
so you know it's probably true.
</P>
<P>
   Out here in cyberland, people have been aware of this fact for
several years. Indeed we have talked of little else since about
September 1996, which is the last time anyone mentioned a book
except in the context of Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   The basic anecdote--variations on ``When I knew him in college
he was stoned all the time ... two years ago he was living in a
corrugated box on his ex-wife's compost pile (we all actually
pitched in to buy him a new futon!) ... then last week they had
their IPO, and now he's worth $350 million''--declined long ago
from fresh conversational gambit through staple to cliche.
</P>
<P>
   So what's new? Money has always been a fraught topic. A New York
writer who regularly mines his sex life and longings for material
begged off an invitation to write about the Internet IPO phenomenon
for Slate on the grounds that his feelings about money are too
personal and complex. And envy didn't just become a deadly sin when
its existence was acknowledged by the New York Times. Nevertheless,
the arrival of Internet Envy on the Washington-New York buzz axis
is new in several ways.
</P>
<P>
   Washington types used to be surprisingly immune to envy of other
people simply for being richer. A theory long propounded by Walter
Shapiro (USA Today political columnist and Slate contributor) is
that the financial heights of Washington are occupied by
high-salaried lawyers and lobbyists, not by real accumulated or
inherited wealth as in New York. The lifestyle gap between the
middle and upper class does not yawn in front of, say, a Washington
Post editor every day. Journalists--even print journalists!--and
high-level civil servants live in the nicest neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   More important, of course, Washington has--or had--a social
status ranking independent of money. It's a place where puzzled
gazillionaires can find themselves snubbed at dinner parties by
deputy assistant Cabinet secretaries and patronized by minor TV
talking heads.
</P>
<P>
   Even in New York, where money matters more, there are (unlike in
Washington) strong independent subcultures in which a journalist or
college professor or unemployed actor can take comfort in an
independent value system. They could have been bankers or
management consultants but chose not to be. And the people at the
top of those heaps, earning plenty to live comfortably, honestly
wouldn't trade being, say, curator of dinosaurs at the Museum of
Natural History for being just another multimillionaire investment
banker.
</P>
<P>
   On most days.
</P>
<P>
   So what has changed? One element, obviously, is the size of
these Internet fortunes. Hundreds of millions. As syndicated
columnist Matt Miller recently pointed out, with numbers like this
surging across the Times business section, even investment bankers
``feel like wage slaves at $10 million a year.'' (And, poor souls,
these investment bankers generally cannot find comfort in an
independent value system.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Washington, where even New York-style fortunes are
rare, it seems that America Online alone (located in D.C.'s
Virginia suburbs) has created a vast new social stratum of
megamillionaires one has never heard of. Gives one pause.
</P>
<P>
   Second, there's the speed. It's one thing to console yourself
that at least you didn't have to spend 30 years doing a job you
would hate. That trick is a bit harder when you read that someone
(inevitably, someone with the same name as that bozo down the hall
sophomore year ... but it can't be ... look, here's his picture ...
oh, hell) joined some nothing of a company, sat there through the
IPO, and cashed out, all in a couple of years. How awful can a job
be?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: maybe not so awful at all. In fact, maybe it's
remarkably similar to the job you're doing now. A third startling
difference about Internet IPO wealth is that some of it is raining
down on journalists!
</P>
<P>
   Writing journalists, no less, at places like Amazon and
TheStreet and iVillage (dot-com, dot-com, dot-com). This is
something truly new in the history of the known universe. Slate's
former ``Keeping Tabs'' columnist Emily Yoffe observes: ``You no
longer can say, 'Sure I could have made a lot of money if I'd
decided to be a Wall Street money grubber.' And it's not just [a
famous TV hack] spending every weekend speaking to the Aluminum
Manufacturers for $50,000. We're talking about journalists getting
seriously rich just by being journalists.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus journalists have joined software engineers and business
executives in peddling the other basic Internet Envy anecdote:
variations on, ``Oh yeah, they offered me the top job at
Somedamnedsite.com--begged me to take it, offered me 75 percent of
the equity plus options for another 75--but I turned it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Even during the first few years of Internet frenzy, Internet
Envy was not widespread in N.Y.-D.C. buzzworld because the whole
thing seemed to be happening on another planet--to people one not
only didn't know but could scarcely imagine. Only very recently
have lottery winners started popping up in one's own neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Envy exists in cyberland itself, too, but it is much
more straightforward. Everybody is trying to do the same thing;
some succeed, and those who don't are envious. You don't have to
pretend that you're not. And there's no queasy feeling that you
must have misplaced that notice explaining how the rules were about
to change. (``In Paragraph 19, Line 106, replace the words
'Pulitzer Prize for Nonfiction' with the words 'seven hundred fifty
million dollars.''')
</P>
<P>
   Also, unlike back East, there's no vertiginous obsession with
how young these IPO-heads are, because almost everybody is
scandalously young.
</P>
<P>
   The rules have indeed changed. But they're always changing, in a
couple of ways. Some changes in personal values are simply part of
growing older. Then there are shifts in the values of the general
culture. To oversimplify: In high school the jocks are on top, but
the smart kids tend to win in adult life.
</P>
<P>
   At the crucial moment when they make their choices, many of
these people honestly believe that money--beyond the cost of
upper-middle-class comfort--is not all that important to them, and
most of them may turn out to be right. But some are responding to
the fleeting hormonal surges of youthful idealism, or to the
special status hierarchy of the academic subculture where they
temporarily reside.
</P>
<P>
   In the most tragic examples, a charismatic professor will entice
them into a lifetime of French medieval history, about which their
curiosity is exhausted before they get their Ph.D.s. In less
extreme cases, they become writers. Then they discover, in their
30s or 40s, that money is important to them after all. This is the
moment when reading about some 28-year-old who's suddenly worth
$300 million can have an effect that requires medical attention.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes this personal process of maturity or decay (take your
pick) is reinforced by what's happening in the culture. Money is
never unimportant, but there are moments when it is more important
than others. This is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, a graph of the changing value of money in the status
market would look a lot like a graph of the Dow Jones industrial
average: It rose steadily starting about 1982--the year a star New
York Times reporter shocked his journalist colleagues by quitting
the Times to become an investment banker--crested and sank briefly
in the late 1980s, quickly recovered, and has been hitting new
heights ever since.
</P>
<P>
   In these days, when even the most softhearted and
public-spirited people become venture capitalists, younger readers
may find it hard to believe there was ever a time when even an
extremely ambitious person, motivated entirely by a desire to do
well--rather than to do good, or to do anything in
particular--might well decide to be a journalist. But it's true.
</P>
<P>
   Of course it's possible that the stock market and the status
market have peaked together again. Price-earnings ratios are
perilously high in both. A $400 million fortune gets you about as
much status as a mere $50 million got you a decade ago. Speculators
in status futures are rumored to be pulling out of money and
getting into undervalued properties including kindness, musical
talent, and short-term memory. The decline of money is also
expected to benefit blue chips such as physical beauty, according
to some analysts.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe this is the wrong moment to cash in your reputation as
a saint--based on two and a half decades spent bathing patients in
a South American leprosy clinic--for a job (with 50 percent equity
stake) as CEO of Leper.com (soon to be LPRC on the NASDAQ). In this
market as in others, timing is everything.

<P>
   &UR; By WILLIAM SALETAN &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Everything you need to know about Gov. George W. Bush, R-Texas,
you learned in kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
   Launching his presidential campaign in Iowa last weekend, Bush
outlined a threefold agenda: to impose ``bad consequences for bad
behavior'' and ``love our neighbor as we want to be loved
ourselves''; to help churches and charities ``to nurture, to
mentor, to comfort'' people in need; and to insist that ``every
child must be educated.''
</P>
<P>
   A less daring platform can scarcely be imagined. Yet the media
lauded Bush's speech for its boldness, citing the ``contrasts'' he
drew with President Clinton while ``appealing to a different kind
of audience from the one that had elected his father'' and
``distinguishing himself from the rest of the crowded Republican
field.''
</P>
<P>
   How does Bush pass off his cliches as confrontations? By
fabricating illusory distinctions and debates.
</P>
<P>
   --Compassionate conservatism.
</P>
<P>
   This is Bush's unofficial slogan. Saturday in Iowa, Rep. Jim
Leach, R-Iowa, introduced Bush as ``a conservative with a
conscience, with compassion.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush used the word ``compassion'' 13 times in his speech,
concluding: ``I know this approach has been criticized. But why? Is
compassion beneath us? Is mercy below us? Should our party be led
by someone who boasts of a hard heart? ... I'm proud to be a
compassionate conservative. I welcome the label. And on this ground
I will make my stand.'' The crowd applauded, and the press swooned.
As the Los Angeles Times described the scene: ``Taking up a
challenge from some opponents, Bush defended his philosophy of
'compassionate conservatism.'''
</P>
<P>
   How does Bush spin compassion, the world's most universal value,
as a courageous ``stand?'' As with most magic tricks, the sleight
of hand occurs at the outset, when Bush says his philosophy ``has
been criticized.'' In truth, none of Bush's rivals has criticized
compassion or boasted of a hard heart.
</P>
<P>
   On the contrary, some call ``compassionate conservatism'' an
offensive phrase because it suggests that unmodified conservatives
lack compassion (just as many liberals complained that Vice
President Al Gore's ``practical idealism'' implied that unmodified
idealists were impractical). Others dismiss this phrase as ``weasel
words'' designed to substitute for positions on specific issues.
What Bush's opponents have ``criticized,'' in short, is not his
``approach'' but its redundancy and insubstantiality. By conning
the media into reporting that he was ``defending his philosophy,''
Bush snuffed out the real question: whether he has a philosophy to
defend.
</P>
<P>
   --Prosperity with a purpose.
</P>
<P>
   This is Bush's official campaign theme. It's supposed to convey
what he offers that Gore doesn't. Clinton and Gore may have brought
us prosperity, the slogan suggests, but Bush will give our
prosperity a purpose.
</P>
<P>
   And what is that purpose? According to Bush: ``America must be
prosperous so that anybody who wants to work can find a high
quality, high paying job. America must be prosperous so that people
can realize their entrepreneurial dreams. America must be open so
that every citizen knows the promise of America. America must be
educated so that all our citizens can realize the American dream.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the purpose of prosperity is ... prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   --The responsibility era.
</P>
<P>
   Bush doesn't talk about moral issues that might get him into
trouble, such as abortion or homosexuality. Instead, he pledges
``to usher in the responsibility era,'' in which we will ``confront
illegitimacy,'' instill ``discipline and love'' in juvenile
justice, and accept that ``we're responsible for our neighbors and
helping in our communities.'' Lest anyone point out the
abstractness and obviousness of these commitments, Bush says they
stand in ``stark contrast to the last few decades, when our culture
has clearly said, 'If it feels good, do it, and if you've got a
problem, blame somebody else.'''
</P>
<P>
   Does Bush really think the last few decades, supervised in large
part by his father and President Reagan, were the era of
irresponsibility? Or is he painting a dark background to lend the
illusion of luster to his pale moral agenda?
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Bush often uses sharp language to obscure fuzzy
thought. ``Some people think it is inappropriate to draw a moral
line in the sand. Not me,'' he proclaims. And what is his line?
``Children must learn to say yes to responsibility, yes to hard
work, yes to honesty, and yes to family.'' Likewise, Bush asserts,
``We must teach [our children there are ... wrong choices.'' Such
as? Drugs, alcohol, and teen pregnancy, he says. And what's wrong
with teen pregnancy? It's ``a sure-fire way to fall behind,'' he
explains, using the language not of a pulpit but of a Planned
Parenthood clinic.
</P>
<P>
   --New idealism.
</P>
<P>
   In Iowa, Bush elicited applause and media excitement by taking
what the Los Angeles Times called ``several shots'' at Clinton. ``I
will not use my office as a mirror to reflect public opinion,''
declared Bush. ``Government should not try to be all things to all
people.'' ``I do not run polls to tell me what to think.'' ``We
will show that politics, after a time of tarnished ideals, can be
higher and better. We will give our country a fresh start after a
season of cynicism.'' ``Americans are waiting for new hopes, new
energy and new idealism.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference between an idealist and a cynic, in this view, is
that the idealist is willing to take a stand contrary to public
opinion. On taxes? Bush proposes ``to give Americans more money''
in the name of ``compassion.'' On special interest pork? He told
Iowans he supports ethanol subsidies. On Kosovo? He ``welcomes''
the peace agreement but says ``America should be suspicious'' of
it.
</P>
<P>
   On the GOP's campaign against James Hormel, the gay man Clinton
has appointed to be ambassador to Luxembourg? Bush says that any
qualified appointee should be allowed to serve but that he won't
speak out against the campaign because Hormel isn't conservative.
On fiscal restraint? Bush says, ``After we meet priorities, when we
have money left over, we must pass it back to the taxpayers.''
</P>
<P>
   Note the caveat about ``priorities.`` Sound familiar?
</P>
<P>
   Like his father, Bush substitutes virtue for substance. When
asked by Newsweek what his family stands for, George W. answered,
``Honesty, integrity, serving for the right reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   And what are those reasons? ``America, and what America stands
for,'' he replied. ``To bring integrity and decency to the process
and to serve for the right reason, which is country above self. But
I'm going to have a specific agenda that addresses what I think are
the big concerns as we go into the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Bush's constant assurances that he's going to unveil
his ``10-point plans'' and ``specific incentives'' any day now--a
vague pledge to be specific--are the functional equivalent of his
father's constant allusions to ``vision.'' The less you have of
something, the more you boast of it abstractly.
</P>
<P>
   --A uniter, not a divider.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's greatest feat has been to spin his evasion of
controversies as a virtue. ``A leader must be a uniter, not a
divider,'' he declares. ``This country is hungry for a new-style
campaign'' that is ``positive, hopeful, inclusive'' and ``unites
America.''
</P>
<P>
   With those words, the Republican front-runner takes a bold stand
against taking bold stands. Shame on lesser candidates who demand
that he choose sides on the difficult issues of the day. He's in
his own league. And by selling the media distinctions without a
difference, he intends to keep it that way.

THE NYC COLUMN: A RECLUSE MEETS HIS MATCH 
</HEADLINE>
  (gm)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll
probably want to know is what, word for word, is in those seductive
letters that the middle-aged J.D. Salinger sent in 1972 and '73 to
the young Joyce Maynard.
</P>
<P>
   Can't help you there, kiddo, even after reading them. Copyright
laws make direct quotations impossible.
</P>
<P>
   But if you have followed this messy business at all, you already
have an idea about the contents of the 14 handwritten and typed
letters, which officially went on display at Sotheby's Thursday in
advance of a public auction on Tuesday. You also may have chosen
sides in the debate over who has exploited whom in this affair.
</P>
<P>
   There seem to be two basic schools of thought.
</P>
<P>
   Camp A includes those who see Ms. Maynard, 45, as nothing more
than a literary Linda Tripp. She has spent her life trading on this
great writer's celebrity, they say, and is now betraying his fierce
desire to remain a recluse by plundering their distant romance and
peddling his thoughts to the highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Maynard's standing with them is hardly helped by her
notorious exhibitionism. She has written about everything from her
sexual dysfunctions to her breast implants, and maintains a Web
site so that her fans can keep up with the latest tidbits of her
life. It matters little to the type A's that, whether or not they
like Ms. Maynard, the letters are her property, to do with as she
pleases.
</P>
<P>
   In Camp B are those who say Salinger, 80, had it coming.
</P>
<P>
   With his letters, he lured an impressionable young woman. In
1972, she was a mere 18 to his 53, and had just made a splash with
an article in The New York Times Magazine reflecting on her life.
She fell understandably victim, the type B's say, to what Ms.
Maynard now calls ``psychological manipulation'' by a powerful
older man. In this camp are those who accept as an article of faith
that whenever anything goes wrong between a man and woman, it is
his fault.
</P>
<P>
   (A version of this emerged during President Clinton's
impeachment when some Clinton haters insisted on referring to
Monica Lewinsky as a ``girl,'' as though she were not past the age
of consent. This so irritated Gloria Steinem that she observed at
an anti-impeachment rally in New York that Dwight D. Eisenhower was
president when she was Ms. Lewinsky's age _ and under no
circumstances, she said, could she imagine herself climbing into
bed with Ike.)
</P>
<P>
   Getting back to the Salinger-Maynard letters, no one can just
wander into Sotheby's and peruse them. You have to make an
appointment, and first you must persuade the auctioneers that you
are a serious buyer. ``Serious'' means you do not blanch at a
pre-auction estimate of $60,000 to $80,000 for the lot, cash that
Ms. Maynard says she will use for her children's college education
(not that that buys much more these days than two years' worth for
a single child).
</P>
<P>
   If you can pass muster at Sotheby's _ and people there say the
appointment book is filling up nicely, thank you _ you will be
treated to a rare glimpse of a cult figure. This hermitic writer,
unpublished since 1965, reveals himself as one who embraces
homeopathy, takes his son to Dartmouth football games, adores old
Hitchcock movies, quotes Seneca and turns on his television to
watch ``The Andy Griffith Show.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of it is charming. But not everything, not by a long shot.
Salinger's views on celebrity are often funny and trenchant. There
are unmistakable echoes of Holden Caulfield. Yet a mannered
pessimism that may be endearing in a fictional teen-ager comes
across as dyspeptic in his middle-aged voice. Grown up, Holden can
be one heck of a grouch.
</P>
<P>
   And you have to wonder what a 53-year-old could possibly see in
an 18-year-old to sustain a relationship for even the nine months
that this one lasted. May-December is one thing. This was more like
February-September. Bewilderment turns to concern with Ms.
Maynard's claim to have discovered in recent years that she was but
one of several very young women who were romanced with letters from
Salinger.
</P>
<P>
   If that is true, you also have to wonder if God played a grand
joke: teaming a fanatical recluse with a woman incapable of keeping
anything to herself, punishing both in the process. J.D. Salinger's
mistake may have been to ignore his own admonition at the end of
``The Catcher in the Rye.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't ever tell anybody anything,'' Holden Caulfield says.

 &HT;    
 By JOYCE MAYNARD  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Next Tuesday, Sotheby's will auction 14 letters by J.D. Salinger
written to me when I was 18 years old.
 &HT;    When I first read these letters, and for many years after, I
believed they represented the heartfelt expressions of the most
tenderly devoted soul mate. Later I learned that I was one of many
teen-aged recipients of such letters.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, my choice to break a quarter-century-long silence
concerning my relationship with Salinger has unleashed accusations
of exploitation and betrayal made all the more outrageous, in the
eyes of my critics, because the one whose privacy I am charged with
violating is a man whose reclusiveness has become an American
legend.
 &HT;    The debate has raised questions about what constitutes invasion
of privacy and exploitation, alleged victimization versus personal
responsibility. It speaks to the heart of an issue every writer I
know struggles with: How much of my story do I have a right to
tell? Above all, it speaks to the experience of countless young
girls and women drawn into relationships with vastly more powerful
older men, the obligation placed upon these women to protect those
men's secrets, and the enduring consequences.
 &HT;    With the sale of Salinger's letters, I mean to lay to rest an
event that has haunted me all my adult life. Before I close this
chapter, though, I want to explain my actions.
 &HT;    Twenty seven years later, I can still bring myself back to the
moment in the spring of 1972 when I opened and read that first
letter J.D. Salinger wrote to me. I was a freshman at Yale and had
received hundreds of pieces of mail in response to an article I had
just published in The New York Times Magazine.
 &HT;    In a voice so distinct and funny and wise that I could almost
hear him talking, the author expressed the view that he and I were
kindred spirits.
 &HT;    That idea struck at my heart's core. Like so many readers of
``Catcher in the Rye'' I felt this man understood me as nobody ever
had. We began to correspond.
 &HT;    For the remainder of that semester, everything else fell away. I
made Jerry my religion, the only one I ever had. I withdrew from
Yale and moved in with him, leaving no forwarding address. I
believed _ despite he 35 years separating our ages _ that we'd be
together always.
 &HT;    From the moment the relationship took on a physical reality away
from the page, it began to fray. The same things he had once loved
about me _ my naivete, my eagerness for experience _ now made him
angry and impatient. He said I acted like a teen-ager. I was 19.
 &HT;    In the spring of 1973, Jerry and I took a trip with his
children. On the beach in Florida he told me with chilling
abruptness to fly back to New Hampshire, clear my things out of his
house and be gone before he and the children returned.
 &HT;    In the years that followed, I fell in love, married, had three
children. Throughout my 20s and 30s _ years in which I wrote
novels, tended my children, witnessed the deaths of my parents and
the end of my marriage _ hardly a week went by that someone didn't
ask about Salinger.
 &HT;    Rumors that I'd lived with him had been around for years. I kept
my silence, even with friends, even with my husband, and never
mentioned Salinger in any of my published work.
 &HT;    But though I didn't speak of him or reread those letters from
him for two decades, my knowledge that I had once been adored by a
great man, and later condemned by him, remained a source of deep
shame.
 &HT;    There is something about the mythologies we create when we're
young that remains more powerful than any we construct in later
life. If I'd seen Jerry Salinger again with the eyes of a mature
woman, I might have been able to view him with a less purely
reverential eye, and to reshape my image of him to one of more
realistic and human proportions.
 &HT;    The same holds true, I suspect, for the legions of worshippers
for whom the name Salinger and the concept of his legendary privacy
continues to remain sacred, in the absence of any information that
might call the mythology into question.
 &HT;    The process of re-evaluating my obligation to protect the
Salinger legend began one night when a woman I'd never met
approached me (pregnant with my third child) and said, lightly,
``Oh, you're the one who got letters from J.D. Salinger. I had an
au pair girl who had a bunch of letters from him too.''
 &HT;    All those years I'd held onto the notion that I was once his
soul mate unlike any other. If that wasn't true, what else should I
question?
 &HT;    Over the years stories kept coming back to me, of other girls
with letters from Salinger, other avowals of unmatched kinship and
connection.
 &HT;    Three years ago, when my own daughter reached the age that I was
when Jerry Salinger wrote to me, I found myself exploring the
profound effects, on a young person, of the kinds of the
all-too-common experiences I had gone through at her age. I didn't
set out, then, to write about Salinger, only to write about myself.
But there was no way to explore my story without speaking of the
crucial role he played in it.
 &HT;    After my book ``At Home in the World'' was published last fall,
two more women who also had relationships with Salinger when they
were 18 wrote to me, describing correspondences and subsequent
rejection eerily like my own.
 &HT;    Before I parted with his letters to me, I read them one more
time. I could still see humor, tenderness and utter originality in
the voice that rose from the pages. I saw something else too:
psychological manipulation and a form of emotional seduction.
 &HT;    His demand for privacy, viewed by many as evidence of his purity
of character, seemed now like the cloak of a man well aware of the
fact that his activities, viewed in the light of day, might not
reflect favorably on him.
 &HT;    I didn't weep, reading Salinger's words to my 18-year-old self,
until I came to the passage in one of his first letters, warning of
the extraordinary danger of letters from strangers, and the power
of words on the page. He was right _ a letter can be a dangerous
thing, as I now know well.
 &HT;    Ironically, no letter I ever received exerted a more destructive
force than the one I was then holding in my hand.
 &HT;    I will not feel moved to tears when my letters from Salinger go
up for bid. My decision to sell them is grounded in the practical
realities of one whose two younger children are now approaching
college.
 &HT;    I am not selling the letters as an act of vengeance, but neither
do I feel compelled not to sell them as an act of loyalty. For me
now, Salinger's letters constitute nothing but the record of a
damaging experience. But to admirers of one of the most important
literary voices of the century, they provide a rare glimpse of a
deservedly celebrated writer.
 &HT;    Some will say that the virtues of loyalty, fidelity and good
taste require that for the rest of her life a woman must tenderly
protect the secrets of a man who has demonstrated something
considerably less than tender protection toward her. As for me, I
believe the letters are better entrusted to a lover of Salinger's
prose than they are to one who made the costly mistake of trying to
live out fictions best left on the page.

 By JOYCE MAYNARD  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Next Tuesday, Sotheby's will auction 14 letters by J.D. Salinger
written to me when I was 18 years old.
 &HT;    When I first read these letters, and for many years after, I
believed they represented the heartfelt expressions of the most
tenderly devoted soul mate. Later I learned that I was one of many
teen-aged recipients of such letters.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, my choice to break a quarter-century-long silence
concerning my relationship with Salinger has unleashed accusations
of exploitation and betrayal made all the more outrageous, in the
eyes of my critics, because the one whose privacy I am charged with
violating is a man whose reclusiveness has become an American
legend.
 &HT;    The debate has raised questions about what constitutes invasion
of privacy and exploitation, alleged victimization versus personal
responsibility. It speaks to the heart of an issue every writer I
know struggles with: How much of my story do I have a right to
tell? Above all, it speaks to the experience of countless young
girls and women drawn into relationships with vastly more powerful
older men, the obligation placed upon these women to protect those
men's secrets, and the enduring consequences.
 &HT;    With the sale of Salinger's letters, I mean to lay to rest an
event that has haunted me all my adult life. Before I close this
chapter, though, I want to explain my actions.
 &HT;    Twenty seven years later, I can still bring myself back to the
moment in the spring of 1972 when I opened and read that first
letter J.D. Salinger wrote to me. I was a freshman at Yale and had
received hundreds of pieces of mail in response to an article I had
just published in The New York Times Magazine.
 &HT;    In a voice so distinct and funny and wise that I could almost
hear him talking, the author expressed the view that he and I were
kindred spirits.
 &HT;    That idea struck at my heart's core. Like so many readers of
``Catcher in the Rye'' I felt this man understood me as nobody ever
had. We began to correspond.
 &HT;    For the remainder of that semester, everything else fell away. I
made Jerry my religion, the only one I ever had. I withdrew from
Yale and moved in with him, leaving no forwarding address. I
believed _ despite he 35 years separating our ages _ that we'd be
together always.
 &HT;    From the moment the relationship took on a physical reality away
from the page, it began to fray. The same things he had once loved
about me _ my naivete, my eagerness for experience _ now made him
angry and impatient. He said I acted like a teen-ager. I was 19.
 &HT;    In the spring of 1973, Jerry and I took a trip with his
children. On the beach in Florida he told me with chilling
abruptness to fly back to New Hampshire, clear my things out of his
house and be gone before he and the children returned.
 &HT;    In the years that followed, I fell in love, married, had three
children. Throughout my 20s and 30s _ years in which I wrote
novels, tended my children, witnessed the deaths of my parents and
the end of my marriage _ hardly a week went by that someone didn't
ask about Salinger.
 &HT;    Rumors that I'd lived with him had been around for years. I kept
my silence, even with friends, even with my husband, and never
mentioned Salinger in any of my published work.
 &HT;    But though I didn't speak of him or reread those letters from
him for two decades, my knowledge that I had once been adored by a
great man, and later condemned by him, remained a source of deep
shame.
 &HT;    There is something about the mythologies we create when we're
young that remains more powerful than any we construct in later
life. If I'd seen Jerry Salinger again with the eyes of a mature
woman, I might have been able to view him with a less purely

 EDITORS: IF PURCHASED, THIS ARTICLE CAN BE PUBLISHED STARTING
SUNDAY, JUNE 20, 1999, OR ANYTIME THEREAFTER.  
 &HT;    
 (PLEASE NOTE: This article has been transmitted three times _ into
the ``a'' general news, ``l'' lifestyle and ``k'' commentary
files.)  
 &HT;    
 By JOYCE MAYNARD  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Next Tuesday, Sotheby's will auction 14 letters by J.D. Salinger
written to me when I was 18 years old.
 &HT;    When I first read these letters, and for many years after, I
believed they represented the heartfelt expressions of the most
tenderly devoted soul mate. Later I learned that I was one of many
teen-aged recipients of such letters.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, my choice to break a quarter-century-long silence
concerning my relationship with Salinger has unleashed accusations
of exploitation and betrayal made all the more outrageous, in the
eyes of my critics, because the one whose privacy I am charged with
violating is a man whose reclusiveness has become an American
legend.
 &HT;    The debate has raised questions about what constitutes invasion
of privacy and exploitation, alleged victimization versus personal
responsibility. It speaks to the heart of an issue every writer I
know struggles with: How much of my story do I have a right to
tell? Above all, it speaks to the experience of countless young
girls and women drawn into relationships with vastly more powerful
older men, the obligation placed upon these women to protect those
men's secrets, and the enduring consequences.
 &HT;    With the sale of Salinger's letters, I mean to lay to rest an
event that has haunted me all my adult life. Before I close this
chapter, though, I want to explain my actions.
 &HT;    Twenty seven years later, I can still bring myself back to the
moment in the spring of 1972 when I opened and read that first
letter J.D. Salinger wrote to me. I was a freshman at Yale and had
received hundreds of pieces of mail in response to an article I had
just published in The New York Times Magazine.
 &HT;    In a voice so distinct and funny and wise that I could almost
hear him talking, the author expressed the view that he and I were
kindred spirits.
 &HT;    That idea struck at my heart's core. Like so many readers of
``Catcher in the Rye'' I felt this man understood me as nobody ever
had. We began to correspond.
 &HT;    For the remainder of that semester, everything else fell away. I
made Jerry my religion, the only one I ever had. I withdrew from
Yale and moved in with him, leaving no forwarding address. I
believed _ despite he 35 years separating our ages _ that we'd be
together always.
 &HT;    From the moment the relationship took on a physical reality away
from the page, it began to fray. The same things he had once loved
about me _ my naivete, my eagerness for experience _ now made him
angry and impatient. He said I acted like a teen-ager. I was 19.
 &HT;    In the spring of 1973, Jerry and I took a trip with his
children. On the beach in Florida he told me with chilling
abruptness to fly back to New Hampshire, clear my things out of his
house and be gone before he and the children returned.
 &HT;    In the years that followed, I fell in love, married, had three
children. Throughout my 20s and 30s _ years in which I wrote
novels, tended my children, witnessed the deaths of my parents and
the end of my marriage _ hardly a week went by that someone didn't
ask about Salinger.
 &HT;    Rumors that I'd lived with him had been around for years. I kept
my silence, even with friends, even with my husband, and never
mentioned Salinger in any of my published work.
 &HT;    But though I didn't speak of him or reread those letters from
him for two decades, my knowledge that I had once been adored by a
great man, and later condemned by him, remained a source of deep
shame.
 &HT;    There is something about the mythologies we create when we're
young that remains more powerful than any we construct in later
life. If I'd seen Jerry Salinger again with the eyes of a mature
woman, I might have been able to view him with a less purely
reverential eye, and to reshape my image of him to one of more
realistic and human proportions.
 &HT;    The same holds true, I suspect, for the legions of worshippers
for whom the name Salinger and the concept of his legendary privacy
continues to remain sacred, in the absence of any information that
might call the mythology into question.
 &HT;    The process of re-evaluating my obligation to protect the
Salinger legend began one night when a woman I'd never met
approached me (pregnant with my third child) and said, lightly,
``Oh, you're the one who got letters from J.D. Salinger. I had an
au pair girl who had a bunch of letters from him too.''
 &HT;    All those years I'd held onto the notion that I was once his
soul mate unlike any other. If that wasn't true, what else should I
question?
 &HT;    Over the years stories kept coming back to me, of other girls
with letters from Salinger, other avowals of unmatched kinship and
connection.
 &HT;    Three years ago, when my own daughter reached the age that I was
when Jerry Salinger wrote to me, I found myself exploring the
profound effects, on a young person, of the kinds of the
all-too-common experiences I had gone through at her age. I didn't
set out, then, to write about Salinger, only to write about myself.
But there was no way to explore my story without speaking of the
crucial role he played in it.
 &HT;    After my book ``At Home in the World'' was published last fall,
two more women who also had relationships with Salinger when they
were 18 wrote to me, describing correspondences and subsequent
rejection eerily like my own.
 &HT;    Before I parted with his letters to me, I read them one more
time. I could still see humor, tenderness and utter originality in
the voice that rose from the pages. I saw something else too:
psychological manipulation and a form of emotional seduction.
 &HT;    His demand for privacy, viewed by many as evidence of his purity
of character, seemed now like the cloak of a man well aware of the
fact that his activities, viewed in the light of day, might not
reflect favorably on him.
 &HT;    I didn't weep, reading Salinger's words to my 18-year-old self,
until I came to the passage in one of his first letters, warning of
the extraordinary danger of letters from strangers, and the power
of words on the page. He was right _ a letter can be a dangerous
thing, as I now know well.
 &HT;    Ironically, no letter I ever received exerted a more destructive
force than the one I was then holding in my hand.
 &HT;    I will not feel moved to tears when my letters from Salinger go
up for bid. My decision to sell them is grounded in the practical
realities of one whose two younger children are now approaching
college.
 &HT;    I am not selling the letters as an act of vengeance, but neither
do I feel compelled not to sell them as an act of loyalty. For me
now, Salinger's letters constitute nothing but the record of a
damaging experience. But to admirers of one of the most important
literary voices of the century, they provide a rare glimpse of a
deservedly celebrated writer.
 &HT;    Some will say that the virtues of loyalty, fidelity and good
taste require that for the rest of her life a woman must tenderly
protect the secrets of a man who has demonstrated something
considerably less than tender protection toward her. As for me, I
believe the letters are better entrusted to a lover of Salinger's
prose than they are to one who made the costly mistake of trying to
live out fictions best left on the page.

 By JOYCE MAYNARD  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Next Tuesday, Sotheby's will auction 14 letters by J.D. Salinger
written to me when I was 18 years old.
 &HT;    When I first read these letters, and for many years after, I
believed they represented the heartfelt expressions of the most
tenderly devoted soul mate. Later I learned that I was one of many
teen-aged recipients of such letters.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, my choice to break a quarter-century-long silence
concerning my relationship with Salinger has unleashed accusations
of exploitation and betrayal made all the more outrageous, in the
eyes of my critics, because the one whose privacy I am charged with
violating is a man whose reclusiveness has become an American
legend.
 &HT;    The debate has raised questions about what constitutes invasion
of privacy and exploitation, alleged victimization versus personal
responsibility. It speaks to the heart of an issue every writer I
know struggles with: How much of my story do I have a right to
tell? Above all, it speaks to the experience of countless young
girls and women drawn into relationships with vastly more powerful
older men, the obligation placed upon these women to protect those
men's secrets, and the enduring consequences.
 &HT;    With the sale of Salinger's letters, I mean to lay to rest an
event that has haunted me all my adult life. Before I close this
chapter, though, I want to explain my actions.
 &HT;    Twenty seven years later, I can still bring myself back to the
moment in the spring of 1972 when I opened and read that first
letter J.D. Salinger wrote to me. I was a freshman at Yale and had
received hundreds of pieces of mail in response to an article I had
just published in The New York Times Magazine.
 &HT;    In a voice so distinct and funny and wise that I could almost
hear him talking, the author expressed the view that he and I were
kindred spirits.
 &HT;    That idea struck at my heart's core. Like so many readers of
``Catcher in the Rye'' I felt this man understood me as nobody ever
had. We began to correspond.
 &HT;    For the remainder of that semester, everything else fell away. I
made Jerry my religion, the only one I ever had. I withdrew from
Yale and moved in with him, leaving no forwarding address. I
believed _ despite he 35 years separating our ages _ that we'd be
together always.
 &HT;    From the moment the relationship took on a physical reality away
from the page, it began to fray. The same things he had once loved
about me _ my naivete, my eagerness for experience _ now made him
angry and impatient. He said I acted like a teen-ager. I was 19.
 &HT;    In the spring of 1973, Jerry and I took a trip with his
children. On the beach in Florida he told me with chilling
abruptness to fly back to New Hampshire, clear my things out of his
house and be gone before he and the children returned.
 &HT;    In the years that followed, I fell in love, married, had three
children. Throughout my 20s and 30s _ years in which I wrote
novels, tended my children, witnessed the deaths of my parents and
the end of my marriage _ hardly a week went by that someone didn't
ask about Salinger.
 &HT;    Rumors that I'd lived with him had been around for years. I kept
my silence, even with friends, even with my husband, and never
mentioned Salinger in any of my published work.
 &HT;    But though I didn't speak of him or reread those letters from
him for two decades, my knowledge that I had once been adored by a
great man, and later condemned by him, remained a source of deep
shame.
 &HT;    There is something about the mythologies we create when we're
young that remains more powerful than any we construct in later
life. If I'd seen Jerry Salinger again with the eyes of a mature
woman, I might have been able to view him with a less purely
reverential eye, and to reshape my image of him to one of more
realistic and human proportions.
 &HT;    The same holds true, I suspect, for the legions of worshippers
for whom the name Salinger and the concept of his legendary privacy
continues to remain sacred, in the absence of any information that
might call the mythology into question.
 &HT;    The process of re-evaluating my obligation to protect the
Salinger legend began one night when a woman I'd never met
approached me (pregnant with my third child) and said, lightly,
``Oh, you're the one who got letters from J.D. Salinger. I had an
au pair girl who had a bunch of letters from him too.''
 &HT;    All those years I'd held onto the notion that I was once his
soul mate unlike any other. If that wasn't true, what else should I
question?
 &HT;    Over the years stories kept coming back to me, of other girls
with letters from Salinger, other avowals of unmatched kinship and
connection.
 &HT;    Three years ago, when my own daughter reached the age that I was
when Jerry Salinger wrote to me, I found myself exploring the
profound effects, on a young person, of the kinds of the
all-too-common experiences I had gone through at her age. I didn't
set out, then, to write about Salinger, only to write about myself.
But there was no way to explore my story without speaking of the
crucial role he played in it.
 &HT;    After my book ``At Home in the World'' was published last fall,

up for bid. My decision to sell them is grounded in the practical
realities of one whose two younger children are now approaching
college.
 &HT;    I am not selling the letters as an act of vengeance, but neither
do I feel compelled not to sell them as an act of loyalty. For me
now, Salinger's letters constitute nothing but the record of a
damaging experience. But to admirers of one of the most important
literary voices of the century, they provide a rare glimpse of a
deservedly celebrated writer.
 &HT;    Some will say that the virtues of loyalty, fidelity and good
taste require that for the rest of her life a woman must tenderly
protect the secrets of a man who has demonstrated something
considerably less than tender protection toward her. As for me, I
believe the letters are better entrusted to a lover of Salinger's
prose than they are to one who made the costly mistake of trying to
live out fictions best left on the page.

 By JOYCE MAYNARD  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Next Tuesday, Sotheby's will auction 14 letters by J.D. Salinger
written to me when I was 18 years old.
 &HT;    When I first read these letters, and for many years after, I
believed they represented the heartfelt expressions of the most
tenderly devoted soul mate. Later I learned that I was one of many
teen-aged recipients of such letters.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, my choice to break a quarter-century-long silence
concerning my relationship with Salinger has unleashed accusations
of exploitation and betrayal made all the more outrageous, in the
eyes of my critics, because the one whose privacy I am charged with
violating is a man whose reclusiveness has become an American
legend.
 &HT;    The debate has raised questions about what constitutes invasion
of privacy and exploitation, alleged victimization versus personal
responsibility. It speaks to the heart of an issue every writer I
know struggles with: How much of my story do I have a right to
tell? Above all, it speaks to the experience of countless young
girls and women drawn into relationships with vastly more powerful
older men, the obligation placed upon these women to protect those
men's secrets, and the enduring consequences.
 &HT;    With the sale of Salinger's letters, I mean to lay to rest an
event that has haunted me all my adult life. Before I close this
chapter, though, I want to explain my actions.
 &HT;    Twenty seven years later, I can still bring myself back to the
moment in the spring of 1972 when I opened and read that first
letter J.D. Salinger wrote to me. I was a freshman at Yale and had
received hundreds of pieces of mail in response to an article I had
just published in The New York Times Magazine.
 &HT;    In a voice so distinct and funny and wise that I could almost
hear him talking, the author expressed the view that he and I were
kindred spirits.
 &HT;    That idea struck at my heart's core. Like so many readers of
``Catcher in the Rye'' I felt this man understood me as nobody ever
had. We began to correspond.
 &HT;    For the remainder of that semester, everything else fell away. I
made Jerry my religion, the only one I ever had. I withdrew from
Yale and moved in with him, leaving no forwarding address. I
believed _ despite he 35 years separating our ages _ that we'd be
together always.
 &HT;    From the moment the relationship took on a physical reality away
from the page, it began to fray. The same things he had once loved
about me _ my naivete, my eagerness for experience _ now made him
angry and impatient. He said I acted like a teen-ager. I was 19.
 &HT;    In the spring of 1973, Jerry and I took a trip with his
children. On the beach in Florida he told me with chilling
abruptness to fly back to New Hampshire, clear my things out of his
house and be gone before he and the children returned.
 &HT;    In the years that followed, I fell in love, married, had three
children. Throughout my 20s and 30s _ years in which I wrote
novels, tended my children, witnessed the deaths of my parents and
the end of my marriage _ hardly a week went by that someone didn't
ask about Salinger.
 &HT;    Rumors that I'd lived with him had been around for years. I kept
my silence, even with friends, even with my husband, and never
mentioned Salinger in any of my published work.
 &HT;    But though I didn't speak of him or reread those letters from
him for two decades, my knowledge that I had once been adored by a
great man, and later condemned by him, remained a source of deep
shame.
 &HT;    There is something about the mythologies we create when we're
young that remains more powerful than any we construct in later
life. If I'd seen Jerry Salinger again with the eyes of a mature
woman, I might have been able to view him with a less purely
reverential eye, and to reshape my image of him to one of more
realistic and human proportions.
 &HT;    The same holds true, I suspect, for the legions of worshippers
for whom the name Salinger and the concept of his legendary privacy
continues to remain sacred, in the absence of any information that
might call the mythology into question.
 &HT;    The process of re-evaluating my obligation to protect the
Salinger legend began one night when a woman I'd never met
approached me (pregnant with my third child) and said, lightly,
``Oh, you're the one who got letters from J.D. Salinger. I had an
au pair girl who had a bunch of letters from him too.''
 &HT;    All those years I'd held onto the notion that I was once his
soul mate unlike any other. If that wasn't true, what else should I
question?
 &HT;    Over the years stories kept coming back to me, of other girls
with letters from Salinger, other avowals of unmatched kinship and
connection.
 &HT;    Three years ago, when my own daughter reached the age that I was
when Jerry Salinger wrote to me, I found myself exploring the
profound effects, on a young person, of the kinds of the
all-too-common experiences I had gone through at her age. I didn't
set out, then, to write about Salinger, only to write about myself.
But there was no way to explore my story without speaking of the
crucial role he played in it.
 &HT;    After my book ``At Home in the World'' was published last fall,
two more women who also had relationships with Salinger when they
were 18 wrote to me, describing correspondences and subsequent
rejection eerily like my own.
 &HT;    Before I parted with his letters to me, I read them one more
time. I could still see humor, tenderness and utter originality in
the voice that rose from the pages. I saw something else too:
psychological manipulation and a form of emotional seduction.
 &HT;    His demand for privacy, viewed by many as evidence of his purity
of character, seemed now like the cloak of a man well aware of the
fact that his activities, viewed in the light of day, might not
reflect favorably on him.
 &HT;    I didn't weep, reading Salinger's words to my 18-year-old self,
until I came to the passage in one of his first letters, warning of
the extraordinary danger of letters from strangers, and the power
of words on the page. He was right _ a letter can be a dangerous
thing, as I now know well.
 &HT;    Ironically, no letter I ever received exerted a more destructive
force than the one I was then holding in my hand.
 &HT;    I will not feel moved to tears when my letters from Salinger go
up for bid. My decision to sell them is grounded in the practical
realities of one whose two younger children are now approaching
college.
 &HT;    I am not selling the letters as an act of vengeance, but neither
do I feel compelled not to sell them as an act of loyalty. For me
now, Salinger's letters constitute nothing but the record of a

 By JOYCE MAYNARD  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Next Tuesday, Sotheby's will auction 14 letters by J.D. Salinger
written to me when I was 18 years old.
 &HT;    When I first read these letters, and for many years after, I
believed they represented the heartfelt expressions of the most
tenderly devoted soul mate. Later I learned that I was one of many
teen-aged recipients of such letters.
 &HT;    Nonetheless, my choice to break a quarter-century-long silence
concerning my relationship with Salinger has unleashed accusations
of exploitation and betrayal made all the more outrageous, in the
eyes of my critics, because the one whose privacy I am charged with
violating is a man whose reclusiveness has become an American
legend.
 &HT;    The debate has raised questions about what constitutes invasion
of privacy and exploitation, alleged victimization versus personal
responsibility. It speaks to the heart of an issue every writer I
know struggles with: How much of my story do I have a right to
tell? Above all, it speaks to the experience of countless young
girls and women drawn into relationships with vastly more powerful
older men, the obligation placed upon these women to protect those
men's secrets, and the enduring consequences.
 &HT;    With the sale of Salinger's letters, I mean to lay to rest an
event that has haunted me all my adult life. Before I close this
chapter, though, I want to explain my actions.
 &HT;    Twenty seven years later, I can still bring myself back to the
moment in the spring of 1972 when I opened and read that first
letter J.D. Salinger wrote to me. I was a freshman at Yale and had
received hundreds of pieces of mail in response to an article I had
just published in The New York Times Magazine.
 &HT;    In a voice so distinct and funny and wise that I could almost
hear him talking, the author expressed the view that he and I were
kindred spirits.
 &HT;    That idea struck at my heart's core. Like so many readers of
``Catcher in the Rye'' I felt this man understood me as nobody ever
had. We began to correspond.
 &HT;    For the remainder of that semester, everything else fell away. I
made Jerry my religion, the only one I ever had. I withdrew from
Yale and moved in with him, leaving no forwarding address. I
believed _ despite he 35 years separating our ages _ that we'd be
together always.
 &HT;    From the moment the relationship took on a physical reality away
from the page, it began to fray. The same things he had once loved
about me _ my naivete, my eagerness for experience _ now made him
angry and impatient. He said I acted like a teen-ager. I was 19.
 &HT;    In the spring of 1973, Jerry and I took a trip with his
children. On the beach in Florida he told me with chilling
abruptness to fly back to New Hampshire, clear my things out of his
house and be gone before he and the children returned.
 &HT;    In the years that followed, I fell in love, married, had three
children. Throughout my 20s and 30s _ years in which I wrote
novels, tended my children, witnessed the deaths of my parents and
the end of my marriage _ hardly a week went by that someone didn't
ask about Salinger.
 &HT;    Rumors that I'd lived with him had been around for years. I kept
my silence, even with friends, even with my husband, and never
mentioned Salinger in any of my published work.
 &HT;    But though I didn't speak of him or reread those letters from
him for two decades, my knowledge that I had once been adored by a
great man, and later condemned by him, remained a source of deep
shame.
 &HT;    There is something about the mythologies we create when we're
young that remains more powerful than any we construct in later
life. If I'd seen Jerry Salinger again with the eyes of a mature
woman, I might have been able to view him with a less purely
reverential eye, and to reshape my image of him to one of more
realistic and human proportions.
 &HT;    The same holds true, I suspect, for the legions of worshippers
for whom the name Salinger and the concept of his legendary privacy
continues to remain sacred, in the absence of any information that
might call the mythology into question.
 &HT;    The process of re-evaluating my obligation to protect the
Salinger legend began one night when a woman I'd never met
approached me (pregnant with my third child) and said, lightly,
``Oh, you're the one who got letters from J.D. Salinger. I had an
au pair girl who had a bunch of letters from him too.''
 &HT;    All those years I'd held onto the notion that I was once his
soul mate unlike any other. If that wasn't true, what else should I
question?
 &HT;    Over the years stories kept coming back to me, of other girls
with letters from Salinger, other avowals of unmatched kinship and
connection.
 &HT;    Three years ago, when my own daughter reached the age that I was
when Jerry Salinger wrote to me, I found myself exploring the
profound effects, on a young person, of the kinds of the
all-too-common experiences I had gone through at her age. I didn't
set out, then, to write about Salinger, only to write about myself.
But there was no way to explore my story without speaking of the
crucial role he played in it.
 &HT;    After my book ``At Home in the World'' was published last fall,
two more women who also had relationships with Salinger when they
were 18 wrote to me, describing correspondences and subsequent
rejection eerily like my own.
 &HT;    Before I parted with his letters to me, I read them one more
time. I could still see humor, tenderness and utter originality in
the voice that rose from the pages. I saw something else too:
psychological manipulation and a form of emotional seduction.
 &HT;    His demand for privacy, viewed by many as evidence of his purity
of character, seemed now like the cloak of a man well aware of the
fact that his activities, viewed in the light of day, might not
reflect favorably on him.
 &HT;    I didn't weep, reading Salinger's words to my 18-year-old self,
until I came to the passage in one of his first letters, warning of
the extraordinary danger of letters from strangers, and the power
of words on the page. He was right _ a letter can be a dangerous
thing, as I now know well.
 &HT;    Ironically, no letter I ever received exerted a more destructive
force than the one I was then holding in my hand.
 &HT;    I will not feel moved to tears when my letters from Salinger go
up for bid. My decision to sell them is grounded in the practical
realities of one whose two younger children are now approaching
college.
 &HT;    I am not selling the letters as an act of vengeance, but neither
do I feel compelled not to sell them as an act of loyalty. For me
now, Salinger's letters constitute nothing but the record of a
damaging experience. But to admirers of one of the most important
literary voices of the century, they provide a rare glimpse of a
deservedly celebrated writer.
 &HT;    Some will say that the virtues of loyalty, fidelity and good
taste require that for the rest of her life a woman must tenderly
protect the secrets of a man who has demonstrated something
considerably less than tender protection toward her. As for me, I
believe the letters are better entrusted to a lover of Salinger's
prose than they are to one who made the costly mistake of trying to
live out fictions best left on the page.

 &HT;    Struggling board game company linked to agent, UF investigation
 &HT;    By Craig Dolch and Charles Elmore
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ A small company set up to sell
black-achievement board games _ and losing about $1 million a year
_ has assumed a curious place in a probe of a sports agent's
alleged gifts to University of Florida players of cash and cars.
</P>
<P>
   BAOA Inc.'s stockholders include Rev. Jesse Jackson, who said
Thursday that as far as he knew, sports agent and BAOA director
William ``Tank'' Black never used the company as a slush fund to
buy gifts for clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is he is innocent until proven guilty,'' Jackson
said. ``I have tremendous respect for Tank. He has done tremendous
things for young people.''
</P>
<P>
   But officers at BAOA said Black is no longer a director there _
contrary to the firm's last annual report posted at the Securities
and Exchange Commission Web site _ and declined to say when or why
the relationship ended.
</P>
<P>
   BAOA, a San Diego firm set up to sell a board game called Black
Americans of Achievement, has reported annual losses ranging from
$1.2 million in 1995 to $882,000 in 1997, records show.
</P>
<P>
   As of Dec. 31, 1997, some 128 investors included active and
former football players Sterling Sharpe, Deion Figures and Ike
Hilliard, as well as Black himself. The NFL Players Association
says players bought the stock for up to $1 per share, but it's
worth about 5 cents now.
</P>
<P>
   Black is under investigation by the NFLPA and Florida campus
police for allegedly giving cash or cars to several Florida
football players before their college eligibility expired so they
would hire him as an agent. He has also reportedly been questioned
by the Securities and Exchange Commission, though an SEC spokesman
said he could not comment.
</P>
<P>
   Steven R. Wright, BAOA's secretary and treasurer reached by
telephone in San Diego, said he was surprised to learn of
allegations that Black had, on more than once occasion, arranged
for players to pay for BAOA stock by way of checks made out to
another firm, P.E. Communications.
</P>
<P>
   P.E. Communications' funds are under Black's personal control,
the NFLPA alleged in a five-page complaint reported by at least two
news organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would be a cause of concern,'' Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   There are no corporate records for P.E. Communications in South
Carolina, where Black is based, or in Florida, where he represents
pro players including ex-Gators Fred Taylor and Reidel Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   Black's attorney, Leonard Mungo, did not return calls.
</P>
<P>
   Belle Glade native Taylor, meanwhile, said reports linking him
to the Black investigation are untrue. The NFLPA alleges in its
complaint against Black that an LSU assistant coach said Black told
him that he used Taylor's money to purchase a car for a Unversity
of Florida football player before his eligibility had expired.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who was a star tailback at UF, denied that any of his
money was used to purchase a $133,500 Mercedez-Benz for former
Florida linebacker Jevon Kearse. Taylor signed with Black and was a
first-round pick by the Jacksonville Jaguars last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that's bull, It's not true,' Taylor told The Times-Union
in Jacksonville. ``I'm sure if (Black) wanted to buy Jevon the car,
he wouldn't need my money. Why would he use my money?
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just trying to make Black out to be a bad person. I'm
not going to buy a $135,000 car. That's stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Also listed among BAOA shareholders is Nathaniel Moore _ but
former Gator receiver turned broadcaster Moore says if he is an
investor, he is not aware of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody can write down my name,'' Moore said Thursday. ``I
don't own any of that stock. I never have owned any. I've never
received any dividends.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore said he has known Black for 15 or 20 years, and they had
dinner at the last Florida-South Carolina game.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I haven't had any business dealings with him and I hope I
never do,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   After losing money on the board game, BAOA reported in its last
annual report that it has shifted its focus to planned
telemarketing operations in ``enterprise zones'' _ typically,
inner-city areas with tax breaks _ in cities including Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   BAOA's last annual report, for the year ended Dec. 31, 1997, was
filed in April 1998. Quarterly reports have been filed since, but
they reveal few details about management and shareholders. No
annual report for 1998 is mentioned at the SEC's website, and
company officials declined to say why a more recent report is
unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   Treasurer/secretary Wright said he had seen no evidence of
wrongdoing in the company's books, nor was he aware of any SEC
investigation involving BAOA. Wright has signed company reports
sent to the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had about no dealings with Mr. Black'' in recent months,
Wright said. ``He's spent all of his time in South Carolina, not
here.''
</P>
<P>
   BAOA attorney Charles Smith said he did not wish to comment on
when or why Black left as a director.
</P>
<P>
   As for Jackson, he signed a two-year deal in February 1997 to
receive 100,000 BAOA shares annually in exchange for consulting
services to BAOA Inc. Company records say he was given 100,000
shares at the end of 1997, then valued at 10 cents apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said Thursday if he still owns the shares, he is not
aware of it.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC, according to Street &AMP; Smith's Sports Business Journal,
has been conducting a year-long investigation into sports agents
and their involvement in clients' finances.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Mungo acknowledged that Black met with SEC officials on
May 25 to answer questions about his role in his clients'
investments, the SBJ reported. The federal agency reportedly
questioned Black, but didn't take any documentation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know any details,'' Jackson said in response to
questions from The Palm Beach Post during a conference call
Thursday. ``I do know that unfortunately the tendency is to try
convict people in newsrooms, not the courtroom.''

   Shoe prints are the most common clue left at the scene of a
crime, but matching crooks and their footwear is not an easy task.
Forensic scientists have to painstakingly sort through photos of
different types of shoes, boots and trainer prints. Now, however,
computer scientists in Northern Ireland have turned to fractals to
take the pain out of classifying footwear and to speed up crime
detection.
</P>
<P>
   Although some police forces have access to shoe-print databases,
these all rely on people to do the classifying. Inconsistencies are
inevitable because the system is subjective, says Avian Alexander,
who developed the fractal database at Queen's University in
Belfast, Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   The new system, however, is fully automated. According to
Alexander, this means you need little training to use it. After the
shoe-print impression is entered into a computer using a scanner or
a digital camera, the system will search through hundreds of
thousands of impressions and give you the nearest matches.
</P>
<P>
   It does this by breaking down each image into a list of fractal
coefficients. Fractals are sets of complex geometric shapes that
look the same over a wide range of scales. Alexander's mathematical
technique makes it possible to describe a shoe tread according to
its shape. In much the same way that complex fractals can be
described by simple formulae, so a mathematical expression that
describes a shoe-print can be produced from an image, making it
easy to compare with others.
</P>
<P>
   The number of shoes coming on the market each year is vast. Some
sports shoe companies such as Nike and Adidas churn out hundreds of
types annually, while maintaining a stock of a few hundred at any
one time. While some lines may be withdrawn, some people keep their
footwear for years, making a large database all the more important,
Alexander says.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the fractal image database much faster at finding
matches than a human, it can even find matches for partial prints
or prints with faded treads. This can be a real problem with visual
identification according to James Thorpe, a forensic scientist at
Strathclyde University, in Glasgow, Scotland. ``As shoes are worn
down, the individual characteristics change.''
</P>
<P>
   The main advantage of Alexander's system is that it does away
with the need to classify shoes into different categories according
to the type of shoe, tread, heel and pattern. The subjective nature
of this task, he says, makes it prone to error: After all one
person's zigzag is another's squiggle. &QL;

<P>
   Japanese wives are turning to off-the-shelf forensic science to
catch their cheating husbands. Private detectives are selling
special chemical sprays that highlight telltale traces of semen in
their spouse's underwear.
</P>
<P>
   Called ``S-check,'' the chemicals are supplied in two aerosol
cans. Each of them is sprayed on the suspect underwear in turn. If
traces of seminal fluid are present, the second spray turns it
bright green.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if this is the same type of spray the police
use,'' said a spokeswoman for the Gull Detective Agency in Tokyo.
``I'm not allowed to tell you what the chemicals are.''
</P>
<P>
   But the method is believed to be similar to the most common test
for detecting semen used by forensic scientists in Britain. Called
the Acid Phosphatase Test, which also uses two chemicals. The
first, alpha-naphthyl phosphate, is sprayed onto a blotting paper
swab previously laid on the sample.
</P>
<P>
   According to James Thorpe, director of the forensic science unit
at Strathclyde University in Glasgow, Scotland, the alpha-naphthyl
phosphate reacts with the enzyme acid phosphatase in the semen to
produce alpha-naphthol. That, in turn, reacts with the second
chemical which is a dye. ``We use a diazyl dye, which produces a
bright purple stain,'' Thorpe says. ``But you could get different
colors by using different dyes.''
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese test relies on the fact that semen is secreted from
the urinary tract for up to two hours after ejaculation. Takeshi
Makino, president of Safety Tanteisha, a detective agency in Osaka,
says the semen can be detected for up to two weeks if the underwear
is not washed.
</P>
<P>
   He says his company is now selling 200 sets of S-check sprays
every month-at Y35 000 ($175) each. Makino says this is a lot
cheaper than the Y500 000 it costs to have a detective tail a
suspected straying husband for a week. Of course, the test can also
be done on women's underwear, but Makino says 99 percent of his
customers are married women.
</P>
<P>
   Thorpe says that seminal staining on men's underwear is of no
value as evidence to forensic scientists because acid phosphatase
may be present from urination owing to leakage from the prostate
into the urethra.
</P>
<P>
   But semen detection is not the end of the story. The Gull
Detective Agency says it has another weapon in its anti-adultery
arsenal: a gel which a wife rubs discreetly on her husband's back
before he goes to work.
</P>
<P>
   If he has a shower during the day _ seen as a telltale sign of
an office affair in Japan _ the gel reacts with water to form a
blister which the wife can look out for when he undresses at night.
</P>
<P>
   Gull says the same gel is also temperature sensitive. Rubbed
into a man's socks, the gel will change the color of the fabric if
the socks are taken off for longer than 15 minutes. The agency
would not reveal the composition of the blistering gel, saying only
that it is called ``infidelity detection cream.''
</P>
<P>
   The potential for catching innocent men in the adultery dragnet
is all too real. As Thorpe says: ``What happens if the man goes to
the gym at lunch time? His socks change color, his back blisters
and his wife divorces him. Who said keeping fit was good for
you?'' &QL;

<P>
   A lake in the quake-prone mountains of central Asia is a seismic
shiver away from unleashing one of the deadliest natural disasters
in history, says an international team of geologists and aid
workers that visited the region.
</P>
<P>
   The Sarez Lake in Tajikistan formed when landslides blocked the
River Murgab in the Pamir Mountains after an earthquake in 1911.
The lake is now 60 kilometers long, up to 500 meters deep _ and
leaking. Another earthquake could breach the natural dam, say the
researchers, who are expected to announce the results of their
survey in Geneva this week.
</P>
<P>
   If the dam bursts, the researchers predict that a wall of water
more than 100 meters high would rush down the narrow Murgab gorge
into the Bartang Valley, devastating hundreds of mountain villages.
The wave of water would start out 170 meters high, says Scott Weber
of the U.N. Department for Humanitarian Affairs, who coordinated
the field expedition to the lake. ``A thousand kilometers
downstream, it would still be as high as a two-story house.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was no warning of the impending disaster, the
researchers predict that hundreds of thousands of people would be
killed. The 17-cubic kilometers of water now filling the lake would
also flood about 50,000 square kilometers inhabited by 5 million
people in four countries _ Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan and
Turkmenistan, Weber predicts. The water would surge along the
Amudar'ya River on the Tajik-Afghan border, eventually reaching the
Aral Sea, which has lost half its volume over the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Weber believes that the risk of disaster is high, as the dam
leaks more each year and part of it slid into the lake five years
ago. A major earthquake nearby could cause a breach, and there have
been quakes registering up to magnitude 7 elsewhere in Tajikistan
during this decade.
</P>
<P>
   But a less severe quake could prove almost as disastrous.
Hanging over the north bank of the lake is an unstable cliff with
deep cracks in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the event of an earthquake, it is likely that the cliff
would fall into the lake,'' says a recent study commissioned for
the United Nation's International Decade for Natural Disaster
Reduction. ``A rush of water, equaling roughly 1.2 cubic
kilometers, would strike the dam and cascade over the top.'' Such a
sudden surge is likely to inflict severe damage on the precarious
barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Weber believes that strengthening the dam is wishful thinking.
It is 500 meters high, 4 kilometers long and located in one of the
most remote and rugged areas in the world. What's more, tinkering
with the structure could upset its fragile stability. Efforts to
drain the lake by increasing the leakage are also likely to
accelerate erosion.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the options of a pipeline down the valley or digging
holes in the mountains to siphon the water into neighboring
valleys. Both options are likely to be on the table when
international donors and the World Bank gather in Geneva next month
to offer Tajikistan help.
</P>
<P>
   For the hundreds of thousands of people living downstream, the
immediate need is for safe havens and an early warning system. The
former Soviet Union installed a lakeside monitoring system with a
radio link to the outside world. ``But it is out of action now,''
Weber says. ``And if it worked, it would call Moscow.'' &QL;

into the Bartang Valley, devastating hundreds of mountain villages.
The wave of water would start out 170 meters high, says Scott Weber
of the U.N. Department for Humanitarian Affairs, who coordinated
the field expedition to the lake. ``A thousand kilometers
downstream, it would still be as high as a two-story house.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was no warning of the impending disaster, the
researchers predict that hundreds of thousands of people would be
killed. The 17-cubic kilometers of water now filling the lake would
also flood about 50,000 square kilometers inhabited by 5 million
people in four countries _ Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan and
Turkmenistan, Weber predicts. The water would surge along the
Amudar'ya River on the Tajik-Afghan border, eventually reaching the
Aral Sea, which has lost half its volume over the past 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Weber believes that the risk of disaster is high, as the dam
leaks more each year and part of it slid into the lake five years
ago. A major earthquake nearby could cause a breach, and there have
been quakes registering up to magnitude 7 elsewhere in Tajikistan
during this decade.
</P>
<P>
   But a less severe quake could prove almost as disastrous.
Hanging over the north bank of the lake is an unstable cliff with
deep cracks in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the event of an earthquake, it is likely that the cliff
would fall into the lake,'' says a recent study commissioned for
the United Nation's International Decade for Natural Disaster
Reduction. ``A rush of water, equaling roughly 1.2 cubic
kilometers, would strike the dam and cascade over the top.'' Such a
sudden surge is likely to inflict severe damage on the precarious
barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Weber believes that strengthening the dam is wishful thinking.
It is 500 meters high, 4 kilometers long and located in one of the
most remote and rugged areas in the world. What's more, tinkering
with the structure could upset its fragile stability. Efforts to
drain the lake by increasing the leakage are also likely to
accelerate erosion.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the options of a pipeline down the valley or digging
holes in the mountains to siphon the water into neighboring
valleys. Both options are likely to be on the table when
international donors and the World Bank gather in Geneva next month
to offer Tajikistan help.
</P>
<P>
   For the hundreds of thousands of people living downstream, the
immediate need is for safe havens and an early warning system. The
former Soviet Union installed a lakeside monitoring system with a
radio link to the outside world. ``But it is out of action now,''
Weber says. ``And if it worked, it would call Moscow.'' &QL;

   Pulling out into the fast lane when a juggernaut is bearing down
on you is not one of life's best ideas. So it is just as well
researchers are developing a car that can predict when you are
about to make a dangerous move and help you avoid disaster. By
observing your behavior, the car can tell if you are going to turn,
change lanes, brake or pass another car in the next few seconds,
and if need be it will activate appropriate warning or override
systems.
</P>
<P>
   By shifting the emphasis of car safety away from the design of
the vehicle itself and looking more toward the driver's behavior,
the developers believe that they can start to build cars that adapt
to suit people's needs.
</P>
<P>
   The research was a joint project between Andrew Liu at Japanese
car maker Nissan and Alex Pentland at the Massachusetts' Institute
of Technology. They say tests using a driving simulator showed
their system to be 95 percent accurate at predicting drivers' moves
12 seconds in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Liu and Pentland's system relies on the fact that simple driving
behaviors can be broken down into long chains of simpler
subactions, including preparatory actions. Even car passengers,
after a little thought, should be able to predict what a driver
will do next, the researchers say.
</P>
<P>
   To make its predictions, Nissan's smart car uses a computer and
sensors on the steering wheel, accelerator and brake to monitor a
person's driving patterns. A brief training session, in which the
driver is asked to perform certain maneuvers, allows the system to
calculate the probability of particular actions occurring in
two-second time segments.
</P>
<P>
   The statistical technique behind the system is similar to that
used in speech recognition software. When driving normally, the
driver's behavior is continually monitored for patterns. When a
recognized pattern crops up, the system predicts the action most
likely to follow. And since it continually updates the
probabilities of these actions, it can adapt to the individual
driver, getting more accurate all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Liu's earlier work involved tracking eye movements to
recognize what a driver was doing at any one moment. In theory, he
says, this predictive system could easily be adapted to monitor
just the driver's eyes. This would mean an even earlier warning
system, since the distinctive eye movements a driver makes when
turning, for example, happen well in advance of the actual
maneuver. &QL;

 &HT;    Gun legislation puts Bush in a tough spot
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Guns rival boots, barbecue and pickup trucks as
emblems of the Lone Star State. But as Republican George W. Bush
attempts to move from the Governor's Mansion to the White House,
Democrats are poised to make gun laws that are popular in Texas a
liability for Bush in a national campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few days, Bush will sign a bill barring Texas cities
from suing gun makers to recover damages resulting from gun
violence. Signing the legislation, which was overwhelmingly
approved by state lawmakers, is a no-brainer in pro-gun Texas. But
it could be politically problematic for Bush in other areas of the
country, especially in pro-gun control, electoral vote-rich states
like New York and California.
</P>
<P>
   Gun violence is heating up as a prominent campaign issue in the
wake of the Littleton school massacre, and gun control advocates
view court action as a way around the National Rifle Association's
considerable legislative clout. Democratic presidential
front-runner Al Gore and gun control groups have already begun to
portray Bush, who also supported Texas's concealed handgun law, as
a candidate who is cozy with the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   ``While some want to pass new protections for gun manufacturers
to shield them from lawsuits, I will work to get guns off the
street, out of the schools and away from children and criminals,''
Gore said this week in a not-so-veiled reference to Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Karen Hughes said the governor ``does not
believe lawsuits should replace legislation as a method of
accomplishing things in a democracy.'' Hughes said Bush views gun
lawsuits as a tort reform issue, not a gun control issue. She noted
that the bill allows the Texas attorney general to approve a city's
lawsuit or file one on behalf of the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Vice President Gore wants to take the side of frivolous
lawsuits, which cost jobs and clog the courts and delay justice for
people who need it, we'll fight that fight,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1998, about 20 cities and counties in 11 states have sued
gun makers, arguing that gun violence adds millions of dollars to
their expenses for medical care, emergency services, police,
courts, prisons, and school security. In most cases, plaintiffs
argue that gun manufacturers could do more to make guns safer, such
as installing safety locks and devices that indicate that there is
a bullet in the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   In most of the lawsuits, the cities and counties also accuse gun
makers of negligent marketing, contending that they intentionally
oversupply cities and states with weak gun laws, knowing that
excess guns will be sold illegally in markets with stricter laws.
Some also argue that manufacturers employ false advertising when
they claim that having a gun makes a household safer. Gun control
advocates cite studies showing that a gun is more likely to kill or
injury a family member than an intruder.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said Bush ``believes that the best gun control is to
enforce tough laws against people who commit crimes with guns.''
She noted that the Legislature this session approved a Bush-backed
bill mandating detention for juveniles who illegally possess a gun,
and that the governor previously signed a law penalizing parents
when their children are injured or killed because the parents
didn't store their guns safely.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said the governor supports instant
background checks at gun shows, which are currently being debated
on Capitol Hill. She said he opposed a background check bill that
died in the Legislature this session because it would have forced
unlicensed gun dealers, who don't currently have access to a
federal database, to perform the checks. Bush opposes laws that
would force gun makers to install safety locks, but supports
``voluntary'' efforts by manufacturers to do so, Tucker said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has never been a member of the NRA or its Texas affiliate,
which gave him a total of $6,000 during his most recent
gubernatorial race, a fraction of the$17.7 millionhe collected.
</P>
<P>
   But former Colorado Gov. Roy Romer, the chairman of the
Democratic National Commitee, said there's only one reason Bush
would sign the lawsuit bill: ``a knee jerk reaction to the NRA.''
``George Bush ducked the issue of background checks, and this is
another failure. I think it raises a real question of his
leadership ability, because it's clearly a response to a special
interest group,'' Romer said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Beard, who heads the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence,
said gun control advocates will make sure that voters hear about
Bush's decision to sign the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Particularly in places like California and New York and Ohio,
we're going to do everything we can to publicize the fact that he
wants to take away home rule,'' Beard said. ``Apparently he's more
interested in the NRA and protecting gun dealers than protecting
the rights of gun victims.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, gun control advocates have won one victory in a lawsuit
against manufacturers, but it wasn't in a lawsuit by a city or
county. Last February, a group of shooting victims in New York won
a $4 million verdict in a case based on the negligent marketing
argument.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control advocates liken the lawsuits to the popular and
largely successful lawsuits against tobacco companies, in which
states have won billions of dollars as compensation for their share
of Medicare and Medicaid costs. Texas' lawsuit netted $17.3
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not trying to drive them out of business _ that's not
the point. Mayors will drop these lawsuits in a minute if the gun
manufacturers agree to change their manufacturing and distribution
practices,'' said Nancy Hwa of the Washington-based Center to
Prevent Handgun Violence. ``The goal is to reform the industry, and
to stabilize and reduce the amount of gun violence in this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Hwa's contention, the National Rifle Association, which
has been pressuring state legislatures to pass laws banning the
lawsuits, argues that the goal is to put gun makers out of
business. Chief lobbyist Jim Baker said the court action is an end
run around the legislative process, and that it is being pushed by
lawyers looking to get rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to blame the firearms manufacturers, who are
highly regulated at the state and federal level, for the criminal
misuse of their product. It would be like suing the Ford Motor Co.
because someone driving drunk in one of their cars killed someone.
Who knows where it will stop?'' said Baker. He added that gun
lawsuits are different from those against the tobacco companies
because tobacco can't be used safely.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody, whether you're a firearms owner or you support
ownership or not, ought to be concerned about the lawyers who hope
to bring this type of suit against industries across the board.''

 &HT;    Texas Guard soldiers train for Bosnia mission
 &HT;    By Mike Kelley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas Army National Guard soldiers, including
several units based in Austin, have begun training for deployment
early next year to the NATO peacekeeping mission in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   When troops of the 49th ``Lonestar'' Armored Division, based at
Camp Mabry in Austin, arrive in Bosnia in February, it will mark
the first time National Guard units will be in command of
active-duty U.S. military, as well as international peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   The significance of that, Camp Mabry spokesman Aaron Reed said,
is threefold: closer integration of National Guard with active-duty
troops; expanded opportunity of missions the Guard may be called on
to fill; and ``a sign of relief on the horizon for some of these
active-duty units who keep getting tapped for contingency
operations one after another.''
</P>
<P>
   The Guard troops began their training at Fort Hood last weekend
and will continue through June 26. Reed, who has served with the
Guard in Bosnia, said that while at Hood, the soldiers will train
in things ``specific to Bosnia.'' Those, he said, include dealing
with civilians on a battlefield, detecting land mines and
conducting vehicle searches.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,100 Texas Guard troops are involved in the current
training for deployment. They will serve no more than nine months
on active duty and probably about seven months in Bosnia, Reed
said.
</P>
<P>
   There will be further training before the troops leave, he said,
including a mission-rehearsal exercise in November at Fort Polk,
La.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the five units based at Camp Mabry, headquarters of the
Texas National Guard, units training at Fort Hood are from Dallas,
Abilene and San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Guard, civilians for most of the year, train one
weekend a month and two weeks every year in their military
specialties.

 &HT;    Find your father now and tell him that you love him
 &HT;    By Phil Latham
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARSHALL, Texas _ I am going to tell you of a horrible mistake I
made. I tell you in the hope that you may avoid making it yourself.
Indeed, on certain days I believe that if I can save just one
person from making this mistake, my life will have been worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   And I will tell you, to the extent humanly possible, without
emotion, dry-eyed and clear of voice. At least that is what I
intend to do.
</P>
<P>
   But first things first. Right now, before another minute passes,
stop whatever you are doing, get up, find your father, in person or
by telephone, it doesn't matter, and say these words:
</P>
<P>
   ``I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   Do not wait to do this or it may be too late. Put this newspaper
down. Do not finish this column. You can finish it when you are
done with the task or never at all, I do not care so long as you do
what I ask of you.
</P>
<P>
   Say the words or risk that, like me, your father will be gone
with those words never having passed between the two of you, in
either direction. Say the words or risk having them haunt you for
the rest of your life.
</P>
<P>
   For they haunt me and I know they always will.
</P>
<P>
   Say the words even if your father is bedridden in a nursing home
in a coma with his mind on hold. No one understands how the human
mind works in its unconscious state. Who knows for sure that your
father wouldn't hear the words and feel some unspeakable joy?
</P>
<P>
   Besides, those words do as much good for the one who speaks them
as the one who hears them. Verbalizing your love, respect and
commitment to honor your father will forever remain in your memory.
Trust me, neglecting to do so will also be with you forever.
</P>
<P>
   The wonderful thing is that, upon saying ``I love you, Dad,''
there is the greatest of possibilities that you will hear it back.
Nothing but hearing that from your mother could be so special.
</P>
<P>
   I had my chances, dozens _ more likely, thousands _ of chances
to tell my father I loved him. Unfortunately, I was too much like
him to act.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't that my father was cold but he had difficulty
expressing his emotion with words. Yes, I know he loved me. I did
not need to hear to words to validate his love but, nonetheless, I
would have liked to hear them. Probably he would have liked to hear
them from me, as well.
</P>
<P>
   Did he know I loved him? I can only hope that he did because I
will never know for sure.
</P>
<P>
   I know there must be many fathers and sons who, like my father
and me, can't quite say ``I love you'' to another man. Is this
stupid? Certainly. I feel stupid every day.
</P>
<P>
   I had a final chance just a few days before he died, as he lay
wasting away in a nursing home, the victim of a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   I wish I could rationalize it all away, that I could say I did
not know he was going to die so soon.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is different. I stood beside his bed knowing that,
when I left the room, I would never again see him alive. The words
rolled up from my gut and stuck on my tongue. I wanted to rub his
shoulder and tell him: ``I love you.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, I turned and walked away. My prediction proved correct.
He died less than 48 hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Like all decisions one makes, I live with the consequences. I
have tried to make up for it by making sure the words are spoken _
and received _ often from my two sons.
</P>
<P>
   It is not enough. It will never be enough.
</P>
<P>
   So my mission in life is to make sure you do not make the same
mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Say the words. Say them now. Say them for me.

 &HT;    A lesson learned from Rosa Parks
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The first time Patricia Ellis headed to the
nation's capital on behalf of Rosa Parks, she didn't make it.
</P>
<P>
   At 7:30 a.m. July 29, 1997, near Petersburg, Va., a tour bus
plunged off Interstate 95 into the Nottoway River. The bus carried
29 students and five chaperones, including Ellis. They were taking
part in a tour, sponsored by Rosa Parks' foundation, of historic
sites in the civil rights struggle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an out-of-body experience,'' Ellis said. She saw the bus
fly into the air and plummet into the river. Submerged under water,
she heard a voice calling her name. ``I was getting ready to turn
around and to see who it was when the water became water lilies.
Even now when I close my eyes, I can see it, and it is one of the
most beautiful things I've ever seen in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   The water lilies symbolized the presence of God, Ellis said,
calling her from death to life, from surrender to the water to the
struggle to save the lives of the children.
</P>
<P>
   This week marked the second time Ellis headed to Washington,
D.C., on behalf of Rosa Parks. This time, the Oxford woman made it
there safely, spending much of two days with Parks and watching
proudly Tuesday as President Clinton awarded the civil rights
heroine the Congressional Gold Medal.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone stood up and gave an ovation to this small, frail woman
who had the courage, nearly 44 years ago, to sit down and be
counted.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a very courageous woman, and she was an instrument of
God,'' Ellis said. ``She was not standing up for herself; she was
sitting down on racism across the world.''
</P>
<P>
   And the world listened _ not only in 1955, but in the decades of
unflagging civil rights activism that followed. ``Mrs. Parks passes
on the courage to be and to do what's right,'' Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in a tight-knit black community in Hamilton, Ellis
shared her neighbors' anxiety when she first heard about the
soft-spoken seamstress who refused to move to the back of the bus.
Ellis was only 14, but she understood the implications:
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most frightening thing,'' she recalled. ``We knew
when anybody goes against the system, when anyone dares to go
against that way of life, especially in the South, there is a good
chance they would be killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ellis grew up to become a history teacher at Hamilton High
School, a civil rights historian, and an adviser for the National
Underground Railroad Freedom Center in Cincinnati. She has won
numerous awards for her work as a teacher and civil rights
historian, including the Governor's award from the Martin Luther
King Jr. Holiday Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Yet she was taken by surprise the morning in June 1997 when she
received a call from someone claiming to represent Rosa Parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right,'' she thought to herself. Next thing you know, Oprah
will be calling.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the real thing. She was being asked to come along on
a monthlong Pathways to Freedom bus tour, designed to bring the
history of the civil rights movement to life for young people. She
would serve as chaperone in addition to her role in evaluating the
program.
</P>
<P>
   During five days of training in Canada, Ellis spent a
considerable amount of time with Parks. ``She doesn't talk very
much,'' she said, but Ellis felt she had come to know the woman:
her quiet strength and spirituality, her graciousness and humility.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-three days into the trip, tragedy struck.
</P>
<P>
   In the first moments after the crash, Ellis said, she felt
herself lying ``peacefully in the water,'' feeling no sense of
struggle. It was only when she prayed, ``Oh my God, are all the
children going to die this way?'' that she shook off her stupor.
</P>
<P>
   The bus had landed on a sandbank in deep water, with everything
under water except the top of the bus. Ellis helped the students
clamber on top of the bus through narrow openings in the windows.
Only one person remained unaccounted for _ Adisa Foluke of Detroit,
a 25-year-old chaperone and Rosa Parks' godson.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis led the students in the Lord's Prayer as they waited atop
the bus. Then she prayed aloud, ``God, I'm afraid.'' She prayed for
guidance and then told the children to form a human chain across
the river of all those who could swim and were not afraid
</P>
<P>
   Adisa Foluke had drowned. All of the 29 students, ages 11 to 18,
survived, although one teen's leg was so mangled it required
amputation.
</P>
<P>
   At first, it was believed that Ellis had sustained a serious eye
injury, but the cut above her eye required only 15 stitches.
</P>
<P>
   Ellis had not set foot on a bus since the tragedy _ until this
week.
</P>
<P>
   She hadn't planned it that way. She had purchased a round-trip
plane ticket to D.C.
</P>
<P>
   For two days, she went to lunch and dinner with Parks and her
group. She met Ruby Dee, Cicely Tyson, Colin Powell, Dick Gregory.
``There were actors, senators, movers and shakers, a who's who of
the civil rights movement _ and me,'' she said, laughing at the
improbability of it all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of those people at the White House could not have been
there if it were not for Rosa Parks.''
</P>
<P>
   Something stirred in Ellis when she saw Parks accept her award,
when she heard her praised as ``the mother of the nation.'' All at
once, she knew she would have to take the Greyhound home, that she
would have to set foot in a bus, despite her terror. It was a
12-hour ordeal _ ``very traumatic,'' she said, ``but it was
something I needed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   It was only in stepping outside herself, overcoming her fear,
after all, that she was able to help save the students.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is only when you deny yourself and come out of the self
that God can use you,'' Ellis reflected.
</P>
<P>
   It is a lesson she learned from Rosa Parks.

 &HT;    Readers, lend me your ears
 &HT;    By Jim Minter
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAYETTE COUNTY, Ga. _ Working for a newspaper has many hazards.
Reporters and editors get into trouble without trying. Thousands of
readers are out there every day, anxious to catch mistakes.
Newspapers, by definition, offer innumerable ways to make them.
</P>
<P>
   Editors and reporters go to a factory every day to manufacture a
product. They never know exactly how the product will be packaged,
or what size it will be. The parts that go into the product come
from all over the world, numbering in the hundreds, even in tens of
thousands if you count words. Nobody knows in advance where these
parts will come from.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few hours these parts must be trimmed or expanded, and
reshaped to fit into the day's newspaper, which is then printed,
and within a few hours, delivered to hundreds of thousands of
doorsteps at the cost of a candy bar. It can be used to learn about
current events, for entertainment, and sometimes for thoughtful
discussion, not to mention lining bird cages, wrapping fish and
starting fires.
</P>
<P>
   When some English teacher spots a misspelled word (perhaps a
typographical error) or a wrong tense, the newspaper gets a letter
asking why illiterate idiots are allowed to work there. Considering
time constraints, newspapers do a pretty good job of limiting
mistakes. Lawyers can take days and weeks at several hundred
dollars an hour to write a single document, whereas newspaper
reporters write stories in minutes, for considerably less.
</P>
<P>
   When I was gainfully employed at the Atlanta newspapers, I put a
lot of effort into making sure we didn't bury anybody alive on the
obituary pages. This can be embarrassing as well as slightly
libelous. It happened on my watch.
</P>
<P>
   A man who was feuding with a neighbor called the newspaper to
report the neighbor had died. He gave all the details, up to
survivors and pallbearers. Unfortunately, a beginning reporter who
didn't know the rules about checking with funeral homes took the
call. The neighbor was somewhat upset to find himself deceased in
the morning paper.
</P>
<P>
   When I signed on as a semi-columnist for the Southside editions
of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, I made a few rules I felt
appropriate for an elderly journalist out to pasture. I would do no
research; would not deal with subjects requiring tedious facts;
would conduct no interviews; would not travel north of Harp's
Crossing or south of Woolsey unless my wife made me. Basically, my
semi-column wouldn't involve real work.
</P>
<P>
   This philosophy was stolen from the late Lewis Grizzard. Lewis
was not only a great writer, he was a great teacher. While visiting
him at the hospital during his last illness, he pointed out that
I'd told him when he began writing a column he should plan on doing
something else after about 10 years, when he was likely to burn
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want you to know,'' he said, ``that I've been doing it for
over 11 years and I'm still going strong.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's remarkable,'' I replied. ``How do you do it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The secret to writing a newspaper column,'' Lewis said with a
sly grin and a twinkle in his eye, ``is remembering a lot of things
that never happened.''
</P>
<P>
   All I can say is it's a lot more fun than trying to resolve
Kosovo and getting tangled up in abortion issues. However, my best
efforts haven't kept me entirely out of trouble. A couple of weeks
ago I managed to marry off a young lady who isn't married, although
I'd guess that won't be true for long.
</P>
<P>
   Relating a guided tour of the new Azalea Estates retirement
complex in Fayetteville, conducted by a charming young lady named
Elaine Odom, I described her as ``the former Elaine Massengale of
the Starr's Mill Massengales.''
</P>
<P>
   I got a nice note from her mother. ``You were right about
everything else, but she is not married _ yet! Elaine Odom is the
daughter of Mary Alice Massengale Odom and Don Odom. She is the
granddaughter of Kendrick Massengale, the last person to operate
Starr's Mill.''
</P>
<P>
   I thought Elaine said ``I was a Massengale from Starr's Mill.''
What she said was, ``My mother was a Massengale from Starr's
Mill.''
</P>
<P>
   All I can do is offer the standard apology and correction and
promise to revisit the hearing aid issue I thought I had cleared up
by returning the two earplugs my wife thoughtfully gave me last
Christmas, and which made the simple act of turning on a water
faucet sound like Niagara Falls.
</P>
<P>
   Not one to give up easily, she has suggested after the
Odom-Massengale mistake that I either get my hearing aids back or
quit writing a newspaper column. At least I'm not alone. According
to Newsweek, one out of 10 Americans suffer some hearing loss, and
they're not all elderly.
</P>
<P>
   I flunked the test on how to tell if you're going deaf. I
sometimes do ask people to repeat themselves; I turn up the TV
louder than my spouse prefers, and she often tells me I don't hear
well. According to Newsweek, I can barely hear it thunder.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of nights ago, the usual dinner-interrupting telephone
solicitation was a young lady trying to sell me an amplified
receiver. I don't know who told her I needed one, but after I kept
asking her to repeat she soon hung up on her own accord. Being deaf
ain't all that bad.

 &HT;    Drama of long series could raise TV ratings
 &HT;    By Diane Holloway
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The Spurs, who boast the well-liked, clean-cut
David Robinson, don't have the superstar power of Shaq and the
Lakers or the Bulls of the Michael Jordan era, but NBC doesn't seem
to care.
</P>
<P>
   Given the sluggish ratings for Wednesday's opening game of the
NBA Finals, maybe it should.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Nielsen national ratings for game one, the
figures were down 36 percent from last year's first game _ about
11.5 million television households this year vs. about 18 million
last year. But NBC is quick to point out that last year's game was
the highest-rated first game in NBA Finals history.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is having a long series,'' said Ed Markey, vice
president of sports press for NBC. ``That's all a network ever
pulls for. Longer series build drama and gather viewer interest as
it goes along.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does NBC worry that San Antonio is a relatively small TV
market (37th-largest in the nation). It helps that New York is the
biggest TV market, and you'd think it would help even more if the
other team were from a top 10 market, too. But as long as the NBA
Finals between the Spurs and the New York Knicks goes at least six
_ and preferably seven _ games, NBC is certain viewers will come.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this were a one-game, winner-take-all championship, we
might be worried,'' Markey said. ``But over the course of a series,
these events have a way of building interest. If the series goes
six or seven games, market size may have no impact at all.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, last year's World Series, featuring the New York
Yankees against the San Diego Padres, was the lowest-rated World
Series ever. The Yankees are popular across the country, and New
York is the No. 1 TV market, but analysts say the ratings were low
because the Yankees won in a four-game sweep with little suspense.
</P>
<P>
   NBC expects its overall ratings for the Finals this year to be
lower than last year, possibly by as much as 20 percent. That's
because last year's Finals between the Bulls _ in what would be
Jordan's grand finale _ and the Utah Jazz went six games and set a
record with almost 20 million viewers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could be down 20 percent this year and still have an
average that's in the top 10 of all time,'' Markey said.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 percent of NBA television viewers are men, and most are
18 to 49 years old, according to Nielsen Media Research. And the
audience for postseason play is different than the crowd that tunes
in for the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you move into the playoffs and Finals in prime time, you
attract more casual fans, people who might not know all the details
of the NBA but like the big story and big-event nature of it,''
Markey said. ``The regular season attracts primarily hard-core NBA
fans, `hoop-heads.' They watch no matter who is playing.''
</P>
<P>
   That's probably why the regular-season ratings for the NBA on
NBC did not sink catastrophically with the retirement of Jordan, as
some expected they would. Nielsen said the regular ratings dipped
only 0.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Casual fans are more likely to be attracted by pop-culture stars
like Charles Barkley and Dennis Rodman. And certain teams with a
special cachet also draw more casual viewers. Those attractive
stars and star teams can spring up overnight, and next year's Spurs
could very well turn out to be the new red-hot team, especially if
they win the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prior to '94, we didn't have the Rockets on too much, but they
made the playoffs, won the championships and something happened,''
Markey said. ``People started to discover how good Hakeem Olajuwon
and the Rockets are. Since then, they've become a staple of our
schedule. The Spurs' success will pay off down the line as we go
forward, and their story will start to grow.''

 &HT;    Don't hit the road
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The urgency coming out of the two-way radio
grabbed the attention of the leather-clad riders standing near the
water coolers in the pit-lane shed.
</P>
<P>
   These radios are usually pressed to the heads of turn watchers
and track bosses when
</P>
<P>
   motorcycles scream past.
</P>
<P>
   Someone on the unattended pit wrangler's radio was shouting.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did he say?'' asked one of the sweating riders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rider down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Riders,'' came the correction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Riders?''
</P>
<P>
   ``How many are down?'' demanded a calm radio voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three,'' said the excited radio voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we need an ambulance?'' asked the calm voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two are up and walking,'' said the excited voice. ``All three
are up. Instructors are there
</P>
<P>
   now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we need an ambulance?'' repeated the voice in authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' said the now calm observer. ``They're OK.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What turn?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he said six,'' said another rider.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be that sealer in six,'' said a rider. ``I nearly lost
it there when it started to rain.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah. Yeah. It must have been the track sealer that is used by
sadists to patch torn-up portions of the racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   When sealer patches get wet, they get slick. This is a bigger
deal to people who ride
</P>
<P>
   motorcycles at amusing speeds than it is for race car drivers.
</P>
<P>
   We were in the second day of the California Superbike School at
Texas World Speedway outside of College Station when the run-offs,
get-offs, high-sides, low-sides and plain old crashes started to
mount.
</P>
<P>
   Motorcycle riders like to know what type of dismount occurred
and where it happened in the hope that they can avoid the same
fate.
</P>
<P>
   If they could talk, I imagine that African gazelles would have
the same conversations after
</P>
<P>
   a leopard reduced their numbers by one.
</P>
<P>
   ``What was he doing? Where did it happen? What did he do
wrong?''
</P>
<P>
   Gazelles get better at avoiding leopards by the constant
thinning of their gene pool by hungry leopards, who get better at
killing gazelles by the constant thinning of their gene pool by
weaker leopards that starve to death.
</P>
<P>
   Motorcyclists prefer less drastic methods to get better at what
they do, which is why nearly 100 of us paid up to $600 a day to
enroll in Keith Code's renowned superbike school.
</P>
<P>
   Code is a legend. He's a former champion racer. He is best known
now as the god of motorcycle racing instruction. He has trained
more world champion racers and street riders than anyone on earth.
Three of the current national No. 1 plate holders have been his
students.
</P>
<P>
   The science of motorcycle racing instruction was developed by
Code, who will personally share his discoveries with anyone who
wants to become a better rider and has a credit card that can take
a hit.
</P>
<P>
   Code teaches all the classroom stuff. He has a stable of
professional riding coaches who guide students on the track where
they practice the drills that go with the latest technique taught
by Code in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   It's classroom-track, classroom-track over and over from 7 a.m.
until 5 p.m., rain or shine
</P>
<P>
   Students can go as fast as they want. They can pass inside,
outside, high or low. But if they crash, they're out. No more
riding.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't the rain or the sealer, in my opinion, that caused so
many riders to go down that afternoon. I think frisky riders were
pushing their newly acquired limits before time ran out, which is
probably a lesson even gazelles should learn.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland Nethaway's columns appear on Wednesdays and Fridays.

   CHRONICLE-SALE (San Francisco) _ After 134 years of secrecy, the
San Francisco Chronicle may be opening its books to some of its
closest and fiercest competitors. The veil will be lifted, a
Chronicle spokesman said, to accommodate would-be suitors lining up
to buy the family-owned enterprise. By JULIAN GUTHRIE and SCOTT
WINOKUR.

<P>
   SLA-FUGITIVE (St. Paul, Minn.) _ After more than 23 years of
hiding in plain sight, the woman alleged to be Kathleen Ann Soliah,

Thursday in a bright orange prisoner's jumpsuit. Her shocked
friends say she was a typical ``soccer mom.'' By LARRY D. HATFIELD.

   TV-REVIEW-SILICON (Undated) _ Steve Jobs and Bill Gates were the
originals, trailblazers who laid down the first cobblestone of what
would become the Information Superhighway. ``Pirates of Silicon
Valley'' (Sunday at 8 p.m., TNT), covering the years 1971-97,
chronicles their rise to master innovators, thinkers, maneuverers
and _ especially important _ thieves. By MARK McGUIRE.
</P>
<P>
   TV-REVIEW-BEGGARS (Undated) _ There are a lot of searing jokes
and satiric insights in ``Beggars and Choosers,'' a tremendously
good new series on Showtime that spoofs all the truths of the TV
industry. But there's one thing left out: Network television is so
littered with average shows that if you want something truly great,
you have to pay for it. By TIM GOODMAN.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-BESIEGED (Undated) _ There is indeed dialogue in
``Besieged.'' Characters swap hellos, conduct business, hobnob with
drunken pals, even engage occasionally in the odd moment of searing
emotional truth. But while Bernardo Bertolucci's enthralling and
poetically simple work includes a bit of conversation, it is at
heart a silent film. By AMY BIANCOLLI.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-DESERT (Undated) _ It's a dry, dry state of affairs
in the Southwest town of Baxter when even Fred Schneider of the
B-52s sounds comatose as the town DJ. It's also a disembodied
reminder that ``Desert Blue'' isn't just the name of Morgan J.
Freeman's somnambulant cemetery of a movie, it's a state of mind.
By WESLEY MORRIS.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-VIOLIN (Undated) _ The best word to describe the new
film from director Francois Girard, ``The Red Violin,'' is
``beautiful.'' Simply, beautiful. The film tells the story of a
violin created by an Italian master in the 17th century and the way
it affects a long parade of lives. By EDVINS BEITIKS.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-GENERAL'S (UNdated) _ The general's daughter was a
freak. That's what the boys around Fort MacCallum military base
called her. But Capt. Elisabeth Campbell (Leslie Stephanson) was
supposedly a freak on a mission, one that gets her ``raped . . .
tortured . . . and murdered'' late-'80s-early-'90s action-thriller
style: her raw, naked body splayed in the base courtyard. By WESLEY
MORRIS.
</P>
<P>
   FILM-REVIEW-SEXUAL (Undated) _ With the philosophical ambition
of a man who's decided that the first few chapters of Genesis
needed an autobiographical make-over, Mike Figgis presents ``The
Loss of Sexual Innocence,'' an allegory configured as a ``personal
journey'' toward some kind of enlightenment about the contemporary
deflowering of our carnal selves. By WESLEY MORRIS.
</P>
<P>
   BUSINESS/FINANCIAL NEWS (``f'' category)
</P>
<P>
   WORKING-COLUMN (Houston) _ If an employee believes he has been
discriminated against at work, he typically lodges a complaint with
the human resource department or affirmative action office. But
what does the employee do when the top officer in charge of
investigating complaints is accused of the very same wrongdoing and
remains in office? Whom does he turn to? By L.M. SIXEL
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTER-COLUMN (Undated) _ If there are remaining doubts about
whether Microsoft ``gets'' the Internet, they are dashed by the
latest version of the software giant's cash cow, Office 2000. It's
the first application suite that treats the Net as a given. By
DWIGHT SILVERMAN
</P>
<P>
   COMPUTER-HELPLINE (Undated) _ A reader asks, ``We have a single
computer in our house that I share with my wife and two small
children. I have noticed that, when the children are using the
computer, their CD-ROM software doesn't work as well as it used to.
... What could be wrong?'' Assorted Q&AMP;As. By DWIGHT SILVERMAN
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS (``s'' category)
</P>
<P>
   BKN-SPURS-DUNCAN (San Antonio) _ He is the anti-MTV,
anti-slacker, anti-showboating, anti-smack-talking antidote to the
next generation of wannabe stars.In a world that worships style,
Tim Duncan insists on offering substance. By STEVE CAMPBELL.
</P>
<P>
   GLF-PEBBLE-SALE (San Francisco) _ A celebrity-studded group that
includes Peter Ueberroth, Arnold Palmer and Clint Eastwood grabbed
one of the most coveted chunks of real estate in California,
agreeing to buy Pebble Beach golf course for $820 million. By PETER
HARTLAUB.
</P>
<P>
   GLF-WOMEN'S-CUP (Undated) _ The favorites are the United States,
China, Norway and Germany, but don't be surprised if the Women's
World Cup, which begins a three-week run Saturday with
doubleheaders in East Rutherford, N.J., and San Jose, turns wild
and woolly. By DWIGHT CHAPIN.
</P>
<P>
   BBN-SOSA (Undated) _ Sammy Sosa's gift for diplomacy borders,
well, on the frightening. Thursday, for example, he performed the
heretofore unattempted ``I Like It Here AND There'' double Salchow
from the visitors dugout at Candlestick Park. To nobody's surprise,
he executed it flawlessly. By RAY RATTO.

FILM TAKES A HARD LOOK AT THE GEEKS OF SILICON VALLEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The celluloid Steve Jobs is seen as the dreamer, the spiritual
druggie with a new-age vision for a technical utopia. Bill Gates is
the porn-loving daredevil who drag-raced a bulldozer one midnight
and won virtually every poker hand he played.
</P>
<P>
   Including his biggest hand of all.
</P>
<P>
   These college kids grew into two very young men who changed the
late 20th century, and certainly all of the next. The computer
mavens _ Jobs of Apple, Gates of Microsoft _ were the originals,
trailblazers who laid down the first cobblestone of what would
become the Information Superhighway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pirates of Silicon Valley'' (Sunday at 8 p.m., TNT), covering
the years 1971-97, chronicles their rise at opposite ends of the
country (Jobs at Berkeley, Gates at Harvard) to master innovators,
thinkers, maneuverers and _ especially important _ thieves.
</P>
<P>
   This is really a chase movie _ Jobs chasing a vision, Gates
chasing, well, the thrill of the chase. This is a movie about
geeks, but not necessarily just for geeks. They are the
late-millennium superheroes, without the personal ethics.
</P>
<P>
   Tinged with Shakespearean themes of loyalty and treachery and
the heights of power and megalomania, this film is above all
engrossing fun, one that will leave you with an observation and a
question:
</P>
<P>
   The observation: Man, they were lucky. Sleazy, but lucky.
</P>
<P>
   The question: Why didn't I think of that?
</P>
<P>
   Above all this is a story about two men, one who became rich,
the other the richest, who saw what others (IBM, Hewlett-Packard,
Xerox) didn't. They knew, just knew, that the computer _ and, in
the case of Gates, software _ would have applications and appeal to
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know how you survive?'' Gates says in the movie. ``You
make people need you. You survive because you make them need what
you have. Then they have nowhere else to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates wanted to dominate, Jobs wanted to shape. Both dominated,
both shaped.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to make a dent in the universe,'' Jobs reportedly
tells director Ridley Scott as he is making the legendary 1984
Apple Macintosh commercial for the Super Bowl, an Orwellian ``Big
Brother'' slap at IBM. ``Otherwise, why even be here? We are
rewriting the history of human thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Noah Wyle, as Jobs, and Anthony Michael Hall, as Gates, may have
also rewritten their careers. The typecasts of Dr. Carter (Wyle)
and the '80s movie geek (Hall) fade early into the movie as both
actors _ each of whom bears startling physical resemblances to the
very real people they portray _ quickly and effectively slip into
their characters.
</P>
<P>
   And Jobs and Gates are portrayed in lights that are respectful
of their brilliance, but far from flattering.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs is seen abandoning his daughter (they reunite at the end)
and eviscerating employees, while Gates is shown to be lying and
manipulative, stealing ideas from those who do not realize their
ideas' import.
</P>
<P>
   The other legendary sidemen _ Steve Wozniak (Joey Slotnik) of
Apple and Steve Ballmer (John DiMaggio) and Paul Allen (Josh
Hopkins) of Microsoft _ are all present, with Wozniak and Ballmer
acting as alternating narrators.
</P>
<P>
   Based on the book ``Fire in the Valley,'' by Paul Freiberger and
Michael Swaine, ``Pirates of Silicon Valley'' was done without the
input of Jobs (who was pushed out by Apple in 1985, but returned in
1997) or Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Writer/director Martyn Burke said extensive research went into
the $7 million project, but this is not a documentary or even a
docu-drama (the movie opens with Jobs and Wozniak getting
tear-gassed at a 1971 demonstration at Berkeley, even though they
did not meet until 1973 at Hewlett-Packard). What it is is very
good drama, abetted by sharp editing and a great soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Gates emerges as dominant, seen on a giant screen
via satellite above a much smaller Jobs at a podium at a 1997
meeting announcing Microsoft had invested in Apple.
</P>
<P>
   The message can't be missed: Bill Gates, Big Brother. In a poker
game with 10-figure stakes, Gates won again.

NO LOSERS IN `BEGGARS AND CHOOSERS' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TIM GOODMAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are a lot of searing jokes and satiric insights in
``Beggars and Choosers,'' a tremendously good new series on
Showtime that spoofs all the truths of the television industry.
</P>
<P>
   But there's one thing left out: Network television is so
littered with average shows that if you want something truly great,
you have to pay for it.
</P>
<P>
   So if you want to watch ``Beggars and Choosers'' (Saturday, 10
p.m.) _ a series that could become the kind of breakout hit that
``The Sopranos'' was for HBO _ get Showtime.
</P>
<P>
   It's the unintentional bull's-eye laugh of the 90-minute pilot,
a kind of painful home truth that indicts the industry.
</P>
<P>
   But this is reality, which the late Brandon Tartikoff, who
developed the series, was getting at while skewering the industry
so precisely. Although it's nice to have an ``ER'' or ``NYPD Blue''
or ``Ally McBeal'' to get hooked on, simple math suggests the
broadcast networks and cable are not creating as many hits as they
once did and the overall quality isn't there.
</P>
<P>
   But HBO has used high quality to virtually force viewers to pay
for something better. After years of strong programming, it hit on
a water-cooler show when ``The Sopranos'' motivated people to spend
the extra money for pay cable. ``Beggars and Choosers'' is the
series that Showtime hopes will be its ticket into your
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beggars and Choosers'' revolves around Rob Malone (wonderfully
portrayed by Brian Kerwin), a man who used to want to be a
playwright but now runs the Luddin Global Television Network, a
floundering, ratings-deprived bottom-dweller. The series is set in
the present, so LGT shows are going up against all the favorites _
``Ally McBeal'' and the rest. Mostly, LGT is dead last, a fact
reinforced every morning when, still half-asleep in the bathroom,
Malone dials in on speakerphone and gets the overnight ratings.
</P>
<P>
   His suffering is helped by an understanding wife (Isabella
Hoffman), but hampered by his 21-year-old daughter, Audrey (Keegan
Tracy), who is moving in with Parker Meridian (Paul Provenza), star
of the only LGT show that has much of a pulse, and a guy not only
the same age as Malone, but an egotistic star seeking a major
restructuring of his deal, which could cripple the network.
</P>
<P>
   Other elements in Malone's stressed life include Lori (Charlotte
Ross), the network's conniving vice president of development who is
out to get his job. And the owner of the network, E.L. Luddin (Bill
Morey), a 76-year-old curmudgeon who has a thing for S&AMP;M. He's not
impressed with how Malone is running the network, even though
Malone just got the job several months ago. (This is eerily similar
to three current real-life entertainment presidents.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Beggars and Choosers'' was written by Peter Lefcourt, who is
executive producer along with Tartikoff's widow, Lilly. What
they've managed to do is tap into Tartikoff's uncanny knowledge of
how screwed up Hollywood and television really are (Tartikoff ran
NBC and was one of the most respected and risk-taking entertainment
presidents ever). Much like ``The Larry Sanders Show'' on the small
screen and ``The Player'' on the big one, there are bountiful,
jaunty elements of satire that go beyond cliche and unmask the
industry for what it is: Mostly shallow (diet fads, gossip, copied
trends), peopled by characters you couldn't make up, and utterly,
dangerously cut-throat.
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to say this is a critical-darling type of show,
given that all the in jokes and characterizations hit home in a way
that's all too familiar to people who cover the medium, but
``Beggars and Choosers'' works on many levels. It's an intelligent,
adult drama-comedy that avoids the heavy-handed punch lines and
spruced-up laugh track of network television.
</P>
<P>
   The shark-infested waters at Malone's network and his struggles
to keep some self-respect and stay employed are ripe for comedy.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Tartikoff knew what he was talking about, and much of
Hollywood and the industry will see themselves in ``Beggars and
Choosers.''
</P>
<P>
   The bigger question is, will you? Is a great TV show worth
paying for? Perhaps that quandary will come up in episode two, if
you order in time.

SILENCE IS GOLDEN IN `BESIEGED' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lest there be any misunderstanding, there is indeed dialogue in
``Besieged.'' Characters swap hellos, conduct business, hobnob with
drunken pals, even engage occasionally in the odd moment of searing
emotional truth.
</P>
<P>
   But while Bernardo Bertolucci's enthralling and poetically
simple work includes a bit of conversation, it is at heart a silent
film. So many turns in plot and character development are revealed
through gesture, glance or a plain streak of light that long after
the final credits roll, it's the images that linger, not the
scattered dialogue. Few movies use so few words so well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besieged'' features Thandie Newton in her first role since
last year's complex, underrated ``Beloved.'' As in ``Beloved,'' her
character in Bertolucci's film is a raw personality, bewildered and
slightly wild; she eats an ear of corn as though it might sprout
legs and run away.
</P>
<P>
   But in ``Beloved'' Newton played the intruder, and here she's
the intruded upon: Shandurai, a young African woman whose husband
is abducted and imprisoned by the military. The film begins with
his arrest and her terror, a nightmare from which she awakens in a
spare Italian apartment. Shandurai is now studying medicine in Rome
and cleaning house for her landlord, an eccentric English pianist
(David Thewlis) whose rooms are filled with art and antiques. As
she Hoovers and dusts, she draws Mr. Kinsky's gaze and attracts his
love, which he expresses in small, mute gestures and enigmatic
gifts sent via dumbwaiter to her flat. Then, one day, he spills his
guts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love you! I absolutely I'm in love with you! ... Marry me!''
he pleads, all immature desire, as he fumblingly tries to embrace
her. ``What do I have to do to make you love me? I'd do anything.
Anything!''
</P>
<P>
   ``You get my husband out of jail!'' startles Mr. Kinsky, who had
assumed she was single, and transforms ``Besieged'' into a
mesmerizing romantic mystery. How Mr. Kinsky responds to
Shandurai's charge will not be revealed here. But respond he does.
And as the plot unfolds, Bertolucci's film becomes less a
conventional sex triangle than an elegant narrative about love and
the nature of promises.
</P>
<P>
   Fluid, economical, luminous and sensual, ``Besieged'' succeeds
because the eye behind it _ Bertolucci's and the camera's _ is so
perceptive. Fabio Cianchetti's cinematography is both understated
and daring, using natural light, broad angles and judicious slow
motion to emphasize the radiant simplicity of the tale.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``Last Tango in Paris'' (less so the director's more recent
``Stealing Beauty''), ``Besieged'' is almost as much about a place
a space is about the characters who inhabit it. Thewlis and Newton
are transparently sympathetic in their roles, but it's Mr. Kinsky's
ornate Roman home that's truly transformed by love.
</P>
<P>
   Aurally as well as visually, the movie works. As in any silent
picture, the score tells part of the story; Mr. Kinsky's stretches
at the piano (practicing Mozart and Bach; ``composing'' a rattling
syncopated piece by Stefano Arnaldi, who also plays on the
soundtrack) are as packed with revelation as those rare scraps of
dialogue. In a film built on wordless epiphanies, music and silence
speak the loudest of all.

WOULD-BE STUDY IN ECCENTRICITY FALLS FLAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a dry, dry state of affairs in the Southwest town of Baxter
when even Fred Schneider of the B-52s sounds comatose as the town
DJ. It's also a disembodied reminder that ``Desert Blue'' isn't
just the name of Morgan J. Freeman's somnambulant cemetery of a
movie, it's a state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman has the dubious honor of having written and directed
``200 Cigarettes'' pulseless twin. That film was Risa
Bramon-Garcia's attempt to wrangle a menagerie of edgy youngsters
into a John Hughes rodeo. This one infects some of those same
actors with contagious doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   ``Desert Blue'' has eccentricity on its mind, but it can't think
of anything nuttier to do than ask Christina Ricci to play a punky
pyro-nut in a town of deadpan wastrels punking and pouting when a
cola truck overturns on the highway and possibly releases the
soda's secret formula into the environment, thus holding the
citizens of Baxter on lockdown until they find what's in that cola.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman is after some evocation of those atomic B-movie
thrillers in which towns are shut down by an ecology under siege.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Desert Blue'' is more a study of what happens in a
post-apocalyptic ``indie'' land after a group of firecracker actors
is given carte blanche to be gruesome mannequins of self-parody.
Ricci is at her obnoxious, nihilistic worst, while Casey Affleck
races around this Thunderdome environment in spoiled-brat
rebellion. And the usually hotheaded Brendan Sexton III discovers a
before-unseen grace in his scenes with Kate Hudson (the reluctant
mint in this get-fresh-soon crew), but this is the one movie that
could've used him to start a real fire.

`SEXUAL INNOCENCE' BEWILDERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the philosophical ambition of a man who's decided that the
first few chapters of Genesis needed an autobiographical make-over,
Mike Figgis presents ``The Loss of Sexual Innocence,'' an allegory
configured as a ``personal journey'' toward some kind of
enlightenment about the contemporary deflowering of our carnal
selves.
</P>
<P>
   Figgis has been consistently attracted to the force with which
sex, both as an act and idea, defines behavior, but turning his
usual anthropological-erotic gig into a loosely intertwined series
of metaphors is a fruit best left on the vine.
</P>
<P>
   Figgis overlays his story of the evolution of a male named Nic
with Adam and Eve's stint in Eden. Nic's life is divulged in
non-chronological chapters of development _ as a 5-year-old (John
Cowley) in Kenya, a 12-year-old (George Maktar) in gym, a
16-year-old (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) in warm lust and as an adult
(Julian Sands) seemingly in a trance.
</P>
<P>
   The structure is intended to illuminate the complexities of Nic,
who's a chopped-up literary stand-in for the Kenyan-born,
England-reared writer-director. He's rendered an enigma instead.
</P>
<P>
   With Figgis at his most self-indulgent, the film is narratively
bewildering. He shows us a pair of newborn babies, blood-red and
shrieking in their bassinet. They're separated and the film flirts
with their reunion as adults (at which point they're embodied by a
striking Saffron Burrows).
</P>
<P>
   One's prim and English, the other a sexy Italian sound-recordist
working with adult (and adulterous) Nic, who now makes
documentaries. Figgis tries to milk irony from coincidence,
resulting in conceits lacking in resonance, drunk on atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   Cinematographer Benoit Delhomme is the dynamo-magician who gives
``Innocence'' its impressionistic opulence, fusing painterly cues
with hypnotic invention to forge a visual fantasia that Figgis'
story can't match.
</P>
<P>
   The absence of substance, or its banishment, and the director's
reliance on allure (in the film's casting and in its look and
sound, which features haunting music by Beethoven and Chopin),
leave ``Innocence'' with the quasi-profound, giggly overreach of a
magazine layout come to shameless, shallow life.
</P>
<P>
   A black Adam (Femi Ogumbanjo) rises from a lake. A few scenes
later, a Nordic Eve (Hanne Klintoe) follows suit. Starman-like,
they wander around The Garden shivering, shyly discovering each
other's privates, having that first pee in the lake that spawned
them. Their eviction from Eden into a media-polluted metropolis
should echo with something more thunderous than the supercilious
aggrandizement of a Benetton ad.

NO `ME' IN MIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Hey, Mia?'' Aaron Heifetz, irrepressible media officer for the
US women's soccer team, is saying for maybe the 5,000th time.
Another camera, Mia. Another microphone, another tape recorder,
another notebook, another face asking you what it's like to be you.
Just one more _ until the next one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aaron's the bane of my life,'' Mia Hamm is saying, pushing him
playfully in the chest. ``His voice gives me a rash.''
</P>
<P>
   Mia-Mia-Mia-Mia-Mia. It sounds like the cast of ``Figaro''
warming up backstage at the Met. Who doesn't want five minutes of
her time for an interview, an autograph, an arm-around-her-shoulder
photo op?
</P>
<P>
   Hamm just got her own building at Nike headquarters in Oregon.
She has that anything-you-can-do-I-can-do-better TV ad with fellow
Tar Heel Michael Jordan. She's the cover girl on the unisex US
soccer guide, celebrating another goal in her bent-knee,
open-mouthed, two-fisted style.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm's just-off-the-press book (``Go for the Goal''),
co-authored with Heifetz, is available on Amazon.com. Her number
(9) is on the back of a million or two age-groupers. ``Is that
player here?'' middle-aged guys ask in hotel lobbies where the
national team stays. ``You know . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Mariel Margaret Hamm, the world's best female soccer player.
She'll never admit to that, even though she's just set the global
record for goals (109 and counting), even though she's been
praised, damned, feared, tripped, grabbed, spiked, and elbowed by
everyone from the Chinese to the Norwegians since she was 15. I'm
still working on my game, Hamm will say. Maybe someday . . .
</P>
<P>
   So the Mia-mania stuff makes her uneasy. ``I don't look at it as
celebrity status,'' Hamm says. ``It's never been how our team's
looked at it, and it's never been how I've looked at it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not like Hamm is Jordan on this team. The Americans won a
world title when she was still a wonderchild. They are defending
Olympic champions. They have lost just eight matches in six years,
only two of them on home soil. Half a dozen of Hamm's teammates are
playing in their third World Cup. Eight have appeared in more than
100 international matches.
</P>
<P>
   Kristine Lilly (``The Queen of Caps'') has played in 179.
Michelle Akers, who scored the first goal for the first US team 14
years ago, still starts. Carla Overbeck played 3,547 consecutive
minutes, went and had a baby after the Olympics, and is back as
captain. Tiffeny Milbrett has scored a dozen goals this year, and
they still spell her name wrong in the papers.
</P>
<P>
   There's no ``me'' in Mia, she'll say, and no ``ham'' in Hamm.
It's not like she craves the spotlight, but she understands that
people have settled on one woman who symbolizes what women's soccer
has become.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm has the medals and the numbers. She's undeniably attractive
(People magazine named her one of its 50 Most Beautiful People in
1997). She's married (to Marine pilot Christian Corry). She's
disciplined, unselfish, modest, approachable. And she kicks butt.
</P>
<P>
   Hamm is the most visible, most recognizable role model on a team
that takes its role modeling seriously. That's why she'll stick
around forever after matches and clinics, scribbling her name and
small-talking with the wide-eyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see the kids get excited about spending time with
you,'' she says. ``They want to know if I get nervous before games,
if I ever feel that it's harder to get out there some days than
others, and what do I say to myself if I make mistakes,'' Hamm
says. ``We have very similar successes and mistakes as young
players do, and it helps them to know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamm grew up as a military brat, one of six children of a
ballerina and an Air Force colonel who was always hopscotching
among bases _ Alabama to California to Italy to Virginia to Texas
to Virginia to Italy. The only constant amid the packing and
unpacking was soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a way for me to fit in when my Dad was restationed,''
Hamm says. ``I'm not a real extrovert, and I was usually in the
background. I wasn't the loud one, like, `Hi, my name's Mia.'
Sports was how I expressed myself. It was an easier way for me to
communicate with people.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamm's message dovetails with the World Cup's ``Watch Me Play''
slogan: I was you; you can be me. ``I think it's wonderful to see
all the kids out there screaming everyone's name,'' Hamm says.
``Because we didn't have that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamm was a Title IX toddler, the first batch of American women
who could count on playing on a high-school varsity and earning a
college scholarship. But once they'd done that, they had no
international stars to pattern themselves after. They had to be the
pioneers themselves.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't even a US national team until 1985. There wasn't a
World Cup for females until 1991, and women's soccer wasn't added
to the Olympic program until Atlanta. So Hamm's heroes were all
male.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Argentina's) Diego Maradona, with his dribbling style,'' she
says. ``(Germany's) Lothar Matthaeus, because of how hard he
worked. He played with his heart on his sleeve. He left every ounce
of himself on the field. And (England's) Gary Lineker. Nothing
flashy, but he knew how to find the back of the net. He was a
cerebral player. It wasn't luck, what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamm knew all about the men's game because she had played it as
a kid. Her adopted older brother Garrett, who died two years ago
after a bone-marrow transplant to fight a rare blood disease,
always brought her along to play alongside him in games with his
buddies. When Hamm played youth soccer, she played _ and starred _
on boys' teams.
</P>
<P>
   When the boys got older and stronger and began banging her
around, Hamm learned how to survive with craft and guile. By the
time she was 15, coach Anson Dorrance, who later recruited Hamm for
Carolina, put her on the women's national team, its youngest member
ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was kind of naive about what the level was,'' she recalls.
``But I wanted to be on the national team because I loved how hard
they compete. I loved the challenges they gave me every day.
Everything was exciting, everything was wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamm was the intense kid with the ponytail who didn't realize
how good she really was _ or could be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mia,'' Dorrance told her, after she'd started two games in
China, ``you can become the best soccer player in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   All Hamm wanted then was to be as good as Carin Gabarra, her
crazy-legged teammate. ``I learned so much from watching her, how
dynamic her touches were,'' Hamm says. ``She'd just spin people
around.''
</P>
<P>
   It took Hamm three years to score for the national team. And
though she started for the 1991 Cup squad and potted a couple of
goals, Hamm wasn't the star. Akers, who scored 10 goals and was
literally head-and-shoulders above her rivals, was. ``Michelle
exposed the game to the soccer world,'' says US coach Tony DiCicco.
``That's when they realized the women were here to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Akers went down in the 1995 Cup opener, it was Hamm who
stepped up and had a hand in nine of the team's 15 goals and even
played keeper when Briana Scurry was ejected with the US out of
substitutes. After she set up both goals on a bum ankle in the
Olympic gold-medal match against China, Hamm suddenly was destined
for posterhood _ and endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was working out at a gym when the Pert shampoo ad came on
TV,'' she remembers. ``And I kinda hid. I was laughing, thinking, I
can't believe this.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamm never bargained on being singled out from a team of
champions. ``Who would have thought I'd have my name on a
building?'' she marvels. And she never dreamed that she'd be going
mano-a-mano with Jordan in a Nike ad. ``He was great,'' she says.
``He made it very special for me. He didn't have to do it, but he
did.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge _ as the drumroll has built toward Saturday's
World Cup opener against Denmark, which will be played in sold-out
Giants Stadium on live nationwide TV _ has been for Hamm to stay in
balance, to be both role model and teammate.
</P>
<P>
   So she's dutifully responded to the Mia-Mia-Mias because she
remembers a time when nobody knew there was a US women's team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm willing to do whatever it takes to put our sport out
there,'' Hamm says, ``especially around an event like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Jordan, she is the larger-than-life symbol of her sport
right now, and she accepts that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's just me, it's a lot of us,'' Hamm says.
``But it says a lot about where women's soccer is and how far it's
come and the increasing potential for it still. It's exciting to
know that we can leave some happiness in someone's life just by
doing something that we love.''

CARPENTERS UNION CHIEF HAMMERS HOME REFORMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE LEWIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON -- His supporters say he's a liberal reformer who's
turned their union around. His detractors call him a misguided
micromanager. But they all agree: David Bergeron doesn't waste any
time.
</P>
<P>
   In the two years since he was elected secretary-treasurer of the
22,000-member New England Regional Council of Carpenters, Bergeron
has slashed some business agents' annual pay by as much as $25,000,
fired seven business agents and organizers, brought in 1,700 new
members, hired 36 new organizers and business representatives and
negotiated the first regional agreement with New England general
contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters say the 45-year-old labor leader's whirlwind pace has
breathed new life into a moribund union. But the ongoing
reorganization of the sprawling organization has led to an internal
revolt by a group of employees called Carpenters for a Democratic
Union, who say the reforms have stripped them _ and members _ of
their rights.
</P>
<P>
   Under the restructuring, the international union will spend
about $25 million of its 1999 budget on organizing. And it plans to
build a $12 million training center in Las Vegas. The goal? To
control at least 70 percent of the US construction market.
</P>
<P>
   The ninth of 11 children born to the wife of a diesel plant
worker in Springfield, Bergeron worked his way up the union
hierarchy, climbing from carpenter to a business manager.
</P>
<P>
   Seated in his South Boston office, he now has the look and
bearing of a chief executive of a Fortune 500 company. Dressed in
navy blue suit and tie, he's come a long way from canvassing
door-to-door to recruit members.
</P>
<P>
   Today, he is at the center of a debate over union democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Reactions to a nationwide restructuring of local carpenters'
unions by the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners in
Washington, D.C., have ranged from protests in New York and
Michigan to wildcat strikes in northern California.
</P>
<P>
   One key change, implemented by Doug McCarron, president of the
international union, angered some local officials, even though it
went into effect a year before Bergeron took office in 1997. It
involved the creation of regional councils to oversee 1,100
carpenters locals.
</P>
<P>
   Another change: The adoption of a policy that calls for the
appointment, rather than election, of business agents at union
locals.
</P>
<P>
   A third reform gives members the right to an advisory vote on
tentative contracts, with elected delegates making the final
decision to ratify or reject agreements. The system works much like
the popular vote for the US presidency and the vote of the
electoral college.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, CDU members aren't happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People still want local autonomy,'' said Thomas Harrington, a
business representative who was business manager of Carpenters
Local 33 in Boston before the reforms. ``People are proud of their
local no matter which one it is. They want their identity, and they
want to be able to vote.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Louvier, a former business agent at Local 43 in
Connecticut, said Bergeron fired him because he did not vote the
way Bergeron wanted. ``There are no checks and balances on the
council. David micromanages everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are 13 positions on the council's executive board. The
highest position is Dave Bergeron. The trouble is, 11 of the 13 all
work for him,'' he said. ``Some of them are afraid of voting
against what he wants. Who is going to argue with the boss? One man
should not be dictating what goes on in the union.''
</P>
<P>
   Council spokesman Bert Durand said Louvier was fired for not
doing his job. ``Members of the executive board have open and
lively debates; they don't roll over because (Bergeron) says so.''
</P>
<P>
   A tall, lanky man known throughout New England as a hard-driving
reformer who turned a bankrupt local in Springfield into a
powerhouse, Bergeron acknowledges that there is a potential for
abuse under the new system. He argues, however, that there was
plenty of abuse under the old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have I ruffled feathers?'' he asked. ``Yes, I've terminated
some business agents, and there is now progressive discipline. . .
I've also brought in more organizers, and we have, for the first
time, a new regional agreement with contractors. There is also more
accountability now than there was in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry is no longer local,'' he added. ``It's regional
and national in scope.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1979, membership in the national union has dropped from
880,000 to approximately 500,000 today, while the number of
nonunion carpenters has grown. In Massachusetts, union membership
dropped to about 11,000 in 1996 from 15,000 in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Documents from the US Department of Labor's office of labor
management show Bergeron has made an impact: In 1997, the newly
formed New England council took in $7.4 million in dues. Last year,
with an additional 817 new members and 267 nonunion contractors
added to the union fold, $10.4 million in dues were collected. That
number may have been affected by a plan to equalize the dues
structure, which was high in some areas and low in others, said
council spokesman Bert Durand. The council, which brought in 912
members between 1998 and 1999, hopes to organize 150 nonunion
contractors this year.
</P>
<P>
   The council plans to use the extra money it has collected to
build financial reserves to help locals in need. ``If the industry
goes bust, we can support the structure,'' said Bergeron. ``The
last thing we want to do is to lay off people.''
</P>
<P>
   If asked to describe Bergeron in one word, his supporters would
say ``persistent.'' Labor organizer Curtis Stubbs, a former
colleague, recalled that while serving as business manager of
Carpenters Local 108 in Springfield, Bergeron doggedly pursued an
East Hartford contractor who was hiring undocumented, nonunion
workers at cheap wages.
</P>
<P>
   After a five-year war, Bergeron got the contractor to sign an
agreement, by luring away his best drywallers and promising them
union jobs that paid $3 to $5 more per hour plus benefits. Then, he
sent organizers to apply for their jobs, and hauled the company
into court for refusing to hire them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to have a slogan on his desk that said, `Never give
up,' '' said Stubbs. ``He was very, very persistent.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked to address claims that union democracy is being
threatened, Bergeron and his second-in-command, Mark Erlich,
bridled at the notion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is now more activism and involvement than ever before,''
stressed Erlich. ``In July, members will determine whether
increases in the final two years of a four-year agreement should be
split between wages, pension, or health benefits. That has never
happened before.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, labor specialists say Bergeron and his peers in other
regions have a tough fight ahead. Dwindling membership and a
longstanding reluctance to organize have not only helped fuel the
growth of nonunion labor, but have also created an entrenched
organization loathe to change.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, private developers have shifted away from having
general contractors coordinate the work. Instead, many rely on
construction managers with business degrees who, in looking at the
bottom line, may not choose to hire union labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Historically, the trades excluded other people,'' including
minorities, women, and other skilled workers without union cards,
said David Weil, associate professor of economics at Boston
University's School of Management. ``Now, they are attempting to
change a system that has been in place for at least 100 years. ''
</P>
<P>
   But as the union takes a more businesslike approach, can it
succeed?
</P>
<P>
   Weil isn't sure. ``Unions are democratic institutions that are
set up to maximize the interest of their members. That usually
means two things: being good at collective bargaining and being
whatever the members feel the union should be. That can be at odds
with an attempt to reshape a union _ even if the union's survival
may depend on it.''

CROWDS AND SPORT GROWING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nobody dreamed it would be this big. When FIFA, which runs
global soccer, awarded the third Women's World Cup to the
Americans, it was thinking of something modest in a handful of
small East Coast stadia. But the Rose Bowl? Soldier Field? The
Meadowlands? Nearly half a million seats sold before a ball was
kicked?
</P>
<P>
   Only in America, perhaps, where the public is always eager to
snap up tickets to the Big Show, whether it's the Olympics or
Picasso or King Tut. And yet the global magnitude of this
tournament, which begins Saturday with the United States meeting
Denmark before a sellout crowd of 79,000 at Giants Stadium, is
undeniable.
</P>
<P>
   The advance ticket sales _ more than 460,000 and counting _ has
already made the Cup the largest women's sporting event in history.
The average attendance will be over 27,000, more than five times
what it was in Sweden four years ago. An aggregate of a billion
people in 74 countries across the planet is expected to watch on
television and 2,000 journalists from 30 nations will be covering.
``This is a breakthrough event for women's sport,'' says Marla
Messing, the Los Angeles attorney who directs the organizing
committee.
</P>
<P>
   It is also the definitive coming-out party for women's soccer,
which until the 1996 Olympics was an unappreciated (and decidedly
underfunded) attraction in most countries. Though many nations,
particularly in Africa and the Middle East, still view soccer as a
man's game, the women are gradually gaining ground _ and
acceptance. ``It's not a global game yet,'' says US men's coach
Bruce Arena. ``It's not played in 190 countries.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, 63 nations of an eligible 115 entered the qualifying
competition that produced the 16 finalists. Brazil, which once
consigned its females to playing pickup games on the beach, has
poured attention and resources into its national team. The
Australians, who finished last four years ago, have cranked up
their program dramatically since they'll be hosting both next
summer's Olympics and the 2003 Cup. And other nations, from Russia
to Ghana to North Korea, are following suit. The future of the
game, FIFA president Sepp Blatter says, is ``feminine.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, who were a Third World team until the 1990s, have
been showing the way both on the field and at the box office thanks
to Title IX and an explosion of spectator interest in women's
sports.
</P>
<P>
   The United States didn't even have a national team until 1985.
``We were a bunch of all-stars in red, white, and blue,'' recalls
Michelle Akers, who scored the first US goal and still starts in
the midfield. Six years later, the Americans won the inaugural
World Cup in China and came back to find that nobody but their
families knew they'd been away.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a couple of reporters at the airport,'' says Akers.
``Now, we can't step off the field without a camera and a
microphone getting stuck in your face.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, NBC wouldn't even broadcast the Olympic final
between the US and China. For the Cup, all 32 matches _ even North
Korea-Nigeria _ will be shown coast-to-coast.
</P>
<P>
   The World Cup will be both a breakthrough and a showcase for the
`feminine future' of the world's most popular sport. ``This is my
game,'' the tournament slogan proclaims. ``This is my future. Watch
me play.''

TRAVOLTA TAKES CHARGE IN `GENERAL'S DAUGHTER' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE GENERAL'S DAUGHTER 
Directed by: Simon West 
Screenplay by: Christopher Bertolini, William Goldman 
Starring: John Travolta, Madeleine Stowe, James Cromwell, Timothy
Hutton, Clarence Williams III, James Woods, Leslie Stefanson 
Running time: 118 minutes 
Rated: R (graphic images relating to sexual violence including a
strong rape scene, some perverse sexuality, nudity and language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Raw tabloid vigor and high-octane performances carry ``The
General's Daughter,'' a military murder mystery that's steamy and
kinky, if also more than a little generic. It's given the dramatic
spine it needs by the bold, strongly arched performance of John
Travolta as a military cop called in to investigate the brutal and
lurid killing. Before her mutilated body is found staked, nude, to
a training site in a swampy Army base in Georgia, we see just
enough of Leslie Stefanson's victim in action as an Army
psychiatrist to realize that she's a formidable person who insists
on exercising every sexual prerogative her male colleagues do.
</P>
<P>
   Her relationship with her commanding-officer father predictably
is not a simple one. But when James Cromwell's general, on the
verge of retiring from the military to embark upon a political
career, calls in Travolta's investigator, he's more than just a
vengeful father. He points out that the Army has 36 hours to solve
the murder before the FBI enters the picture and the case goes
public and, in his words, turns into a circus. With jutting jaw and
icy blue eyes narrowed in meaningful focus, Travolta's cop assures
the general that he's a good soldier loyal to the Army. What he
doesn't say is that he isn't going to allow that to compromise his
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Things immediately grow more complicated and more interesting
when he finds he's sharing the case with Madeleine Stowe's rape
counselor and Criminal Investigation Division colleague. There's
talk about an affair they once had in Brussels. At one point,
Travolta slyly goofs on ``Casablanca'' when he says, ``We'll always
have Brussels.'' But while Stowe's poise and savvy make even her
interrogations seem sexy, there are no sexual sparks between the
two leads. ``The General's Daughter'' is not a film that's going to
make it on resonant dialogue or on anything but a relentless
selling of punched-up violence. Some of that violence is frankly
gratuitous, especially in a prologue that shows Travolta
undercover, nailing gunrunners.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about that intro is Travolta broadly unspooling a
corn-pone Southern accent that's soon revealed to be another
self-spoof. In fact, Travolta's use of humor to relieve a grim and
brutal story is the film's most pleasantly surprising element.
Stowe can more than hold up her end of the film's sultry tone. The
other supporting performances are strong, too, especially James
Woods's turn as the dead woman's commanding officer, a character
who is not unacquainted with mind games. It will occur to many that
the general seems a bit too inhumanly blameless, but then everybody
with lines is a suspect. These include Clarence Williams III's
fiercely loyal aide, Timothy Hutton's nosy provost marshal, and
Daniel von Bargen's nasty local police chief, whose son dated the
murdered woman.
</P>
<P>
   The selling of the violence and kinkiness is rather more
apparent than any devotion the film may have to feminist principle,
despite the strength with which its two women act (before one is
viciously murdered). In the end, it's the investigative square-offs
that provide the best scenes, Travolta's with Woods's cagy colonel,
Stowe's with a cocky West Point grad. TV series have been built on
characters less compelling than Stowe's, and Travolta once again
makes virtuosity look deceptively easy. Watching him square his
shoulders and stride purposefully into the challenge of carrying
yet another film has become one of the satisfying filmgoing
experiences of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   It's what's being carried in the case of ``The General's
Daughter'' that will give pause to some. Me, for one. Although I
don't subscribe to the currently fashionable and morally convenient
Hollywood-bashing (what ever happened to the idea of making it
harder to get guns?), I felt in the end that this film is just a
little too mechanical and hokey and cynical to divert us from the
way it's cashing in on some pretty meretricious stuff. ``The
General's Daughter'' doesn't seem to bring any point of view to
what it's depicting except a skilled, efficient crudity in
depicting it. It's that bulldozing imperative that I find too
off-putting to allow ``The General's Daughter'' to be thought of as
entertainment.

sweepstakes came as a surprise when it was reported Wednesday and
confirmed Thursday by Tony Ridder, chairman and chief executive
officer of Knight Ridder, which owns the Mercury News, the Contra
Costa (Calif.) Times and newspapers in Miami, Philadelphia and
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   In early May, Ridder said he had no interest in acquiring the
Chronicle. ``(W)e would have tough Justice Department objections to
overcome,'' Ridder was quoted as saying in the Mercury News.
</P>
<P>
   He was referring to likely objections by the department to the
acquisition by Knight Ridder of any other newspapers in the San
Francisco Bay area, in light of federal antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Ridder reversed himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to our lawyers and I think we are in a position to
buy it _ probably all of their newspapers,'' Ridder told the
Examiner. ``We have not actually made a decision to buy. We're
going to be looking at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridder, whose company competes with the Chronicle and Examiner,
denied that he would attempt to see proprietary data without having
a genuine interest in purchasing the Chronicle and smaller dailies
in Illinois and Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would not look at the book of a company unless there is a
real interest there,'' he said. ``I don't do it just to learn
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Included in the book will be historical business data, financial
data, long- and short-term performance projections and analyses of
various company holdings, said William Sherman, a senior partner in
the Palo Alto office of the Morrison &AMP; Foerster law firm.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette (DLJ), the New York investment
banking firm authorized to sell the company, on Wednesday provided
Chronicle Publishing's board of directors with a list of
prospective buyers, including the Hearst Corp., which owns the
Examiner and 11 other daily newspapers; General Electric (owner of
NBC TV); Fox; Gannett; the New York Times; NBC; News Corp. and
Knight Ridder.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a joint operating agreement between the Examiner and
the Chronicle, the Hearst Corp. has the right of first refusal in
any sale of the Chronicle. Estimates of the value of the Chronicle
Publishing Co. have ranged from $1.5 billion to $3.2 billion.

AS COACH OF US, DICICCO HOPES TO ALIGN PLANETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The coach from Mars is talking about communicating with players
from Venus. ``There is a different approach,'' Tony DiCicco says.
``You can't be an in-your-face type coach with women. You have to
recognize the differences.''
</P>
<P>
   The 50-year-old DiCicco, who has directed the US women's soccer
team to 93 victories and an Olympic gold medal in five years, has
collected enough data _ both empirical and anecdotal _ for a
grad-level seminar on gender subtleties.
</P>
<P>
   Female players take criticism much more personally than males
do, DiCicco has observed, even if it's not directed at them
individually. Their bonds with each other are decidedly deeper. And
they're more concerned about balancing their sport and their
personal lives than men are.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the American women may be on top of the world because
they're comfortable playing like Martians on the field. Their
practices are relentlessly cutthroat _ cleats going hard into
ankles, heads knocking in mid-air, shoulders banging shoulders on
the dead run. ``One thing we want in practice is intensity,'' says
DiCicco. ``We don't want them to be kick-arounds. We don't grow
from them.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Americans' matches are 90 minutes at full-ahead _ with
no quarter given. If the scoreboard says 9-0, it says 9-0. ``We
don't take anyone lightly, even teams that are emerging,'' says
DiCicco, whose squad is the odds-on favorite to regain the World
Cup title it lost to the Norwegians four years ago. ``We call that
respect. To go out totally prepared and try to hammer them, to try
to win the game as convincingly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   It's what Mia Hamm calls the ``warrior mentality'' and it was
part of the US team's culture even before DiCicco took over from
the legendary (and controversial) Anson Dorrance. His job, he says,
is to keep upping the ante _ because he knows how quickly the gap
is narrowing between the US and the rest of the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep trying to raise our own standard,'' DiCicco says. ``I
challenge them to keep trying, to keep achieving, to create a
legacy in the game that will never be surpassed. Can we be better?
Can we do it quicker? Can we do it more efficiently?''
</P>
<P>
   The desire for victory, the demand for excellence, and the
willingness to sacrifice for it, DiCicco says, is gender-blind.
He's seen Michelle Akers play on rebuilt knees and fight a daily
battle with chronic fatigue syndrome for nearly a decade. He
watched Hamm, running on a sprained ankle, set up the goals that
beat China at Olympus. He saw Joy Fawcett back scrimmaging two
weeks after giving birth. The most significant difference between
Mars and Venus, DiCicco will testify, is that Mars doesn't have to
nurse in the dressing room between halves.
</P>
<P>
   DiCicco got an early tutorial in gender subtleties when he
signed on as Dorrance's assistant in 1991. ``After we lost a match
to China, I mentioned a couple of players' names individually when
we were watching the video,'' he remembers. ``Later, it got back to
me that they were blaming themselves for the loss.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the first in a series of lessons that DiCicco took to
heart. ``In the men's game, you point something out and it bounces
off,'' he says. ``Or they say, yeah, but other guys were screwing
up worse than me.''
</P>
<P>
   When you talk to the entire team, DiCicco says, each woman
thinks you're speaking to her. ``With men,'' he says, ``you talk to
the group and each guy says, yeah, those other guys better get it
done.''
</P>
<P>
   The bonding among female players, DiCicco says, is profound.
``It goes way beyond teammates,'' he says. ``It's about
relationships. I'll say, write down your best team for me and
invariably they'll put their best friends on the list whether they
belong there or not. Men are more objective. They may hate the guy,
but if he gets the job done, they want him in the lineup.''
</P>
<P>
   And to women, having balance between their on-field and
off-field lives is vital. ``If they get disconnected,'' DiCicco
says, ``you might as well send them home.''
</P>
<P>
   So DiCicco, who has talked shop with Ben Smith, who coached the
US women's ice hockey to the gold medal at Nagano, keeps his
residency camps short to minimize family frictions. ``Train them in
short blocks, then get them out of there,'' he says. DiCicco has
also learned to pick his team early. ``So they have a chance to
bond,'' he says. ``Because they may have lost a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet beyond the Mars/Venus nuances, the more delicate challenge
for DiCicco has been directing, and revitalizing, a team that was
already world champion before he took over.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the women who won the 1991 title _ Hamm, Akers, Fawcett,
Kristine Lilly, Julie Foudy, Carla Overbeck _ are playing on their
third Cup team. Eight of them have made more than 100 international
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   DiCicco, who grew up in Wethersfield, Conn., captained the
Springfield College varsity and spent five years in the American
Soccer League, played one match (against Bermuda) for the US men's
team back when it was so anonymous that it could have doubled as a
witness protection program. He understands he's not coaching the
Hartford Helenas any more.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very good at talking to Carla and I for feedback,'' says
Foudy, who is co-captain with Overbeck. ``He'll say, are they
tired? Do they need a day off? He'll listen.''
</P>
<P>
   DiCicco has learned when to push his squad and when to back off.
``We're a wacky group with a lot of personality and energy,'' says
Foudy. ``But Tony knows when to be intense with us and when to let
us be loose.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, in camp at the Pingry School in the suburbs west of
Newark, N.J., DiCicco was letting his players be loose. They'd
knocked each other around for weeks this winter in their Orlando
camp and crisscrossed the country this spring playing 10
exhibitions against everyone from China to Canada. They'd earned,
and needed, a few days to relax and focus _ and phone home.
</P>
<P>
   What DiCicco also understands is that the pressure on his
players is enormous. They're not only supposed to win back the Cup,
they're suppposed to inspire a generation of American girls and lay
the groundwork for a women's professional league. That is the real
difference between Mars and Venus when it comes to US soccer,
DiCicco's warriors can tell you. Mars was only expected to survive
the first round when the Cup was here in 1994. Venus is expected to
do it all.

GRANT BEARING A HEAVY WEIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ He's not selling tickets and he's trying to sell
himself. Such is the life of ``The Next Great Heavyweight,'' as
Michael Grant has been dubbed by people praying that is true.
</P>
<P>
   Grant may or may not actually be The Next Great Heavyweight, but
for the moment, at least, he has been handed that designation in
the boxing world, and he's finding it not as easy a place to
function in as one might hope. More than half of the 5,700 tickets
available for Saturday's fight against Bronx-native Lou Savarese at
the Garden remained unsold Thursday, and the Knicks' run to the NBA
Finals has knocked him to the edges of New York's many sports
pages.
</P>
<P>
   It has also left the undefeated Grant in an odd position. He may
be The Next Great Heavyweight, but on the day he came to New York
to discuss the point, there was more talk about whether stablemate
Evander Holyfield would fight Lennox Lewis in a rematch in November
than there was of his bout with Savarese, even though the winner
has been designated as Lewis's likely next opponent if
Lewis-Holyfield II cannot be made.
</P>
<P>
   Is this any way for The Next Great Heavyweight to be treated?
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sometimes like I'm fighting God,'' Savarese said, the
sarcasm dripping from his lips. ``Michael Grant is the greatest
fighter of all time, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   That seems unlikley, and if Grant doesn't find a way to beat
Savarese, who is his greatest challenge to date but not a great
fighter, he won't any longer be considered The Next Great
Heavyweight, either. Instead, he'll just be another 6-foot-7-inch
guy who wasn't what we thought he was.
</P>
<P>
   Grant (29-0, 21 KOs) fully understands this, just as he
understands he doesn't yet fully understand his craft. He did not
even begin to fight until seven years ago, after runs as a college
basketball player, football player, and baseball pitcher of note in
Chicago and then around Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he played basketball briefly for Fullerton State
before being discovered in a Las Vegas casino by part-time referee
and full-time pit boss Richard Steele, who took one look at Grant's
massive frame and suggested he move on to other athletic pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   Grant did, for a time under the direction of Steele's wife,
before hooking up first with Bill Cayton and now with Craig
Hamilton and Jim Thomas, Holyfield's attorney. Through most of that
time he's been ably trained by Don Turner, a longtime New York
fight fixture who claims, ``Michael will be better than all them
before he's done.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyperbole is not usually Turner's stock and trade, but he
believes in Grant's punching power, his character, his ability to
take a shot on the beak and his willingness to fight when the real
fighting begins. All of those traits may or may not be tested by
Savarese (39-2, 32 KOs) because although he is a veteran who went
12 rounds with George Foreman, he also got knocked out in five
rounds in his next fight by journeyman David Izon, the same Izon
Grant KO'd in five rounds.
</P>
<P>
   This makes Savarese as much of an unknown as Grant, although the
fact is the fight wasn't made by HBO and Grant's promoters with the
intention of showcasing Lou Savarese. So what this all means is as
difficult to fathom at the moment as whether or not Grant is as
advertised or proves to be merely the latest guy handed the title
of Crown Prince of Pugilism before he earned it.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, Michael Grant at least seems to understand the
position he's in is tenuous, until he proves otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Patience is on my side,'' Grant said. ``I'm just sitting back
and waiting and if I have to wait a little longer for my chance,
I'll wait longer. Until then I just have to show people something
in fights like this. I don't even think about the title. I think
about my next fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the ring, I'm starting to feel more comfortable but there
were many times I wondered if this was right for me. It's not
natural yet (hand-to-hand combat), but it's starting to get
comfortable. You have to develop a different mentality in this
sport than in other sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I finally went over that hill last year. I finally began to
let go of those other sports after I beat Al Cole and Jorge Luis
Gonzalez. Until then I watched Keyshawn (Johnson, a boyhood friend
who is the New York Jets' top receiver and a former No. 1 draft
choice) and my friends playing college basketball or in the NBA and
it kept ringing in my head a lot what else I might have done. But
after those wins in 1997, I started thinking about what I could do
next in this sport.''
</P>
<P>
   What his people may have him do next _ if he beats Savarese and
HBO can't beat back promoter Don King's refusal to sign a morals
clause that would eliminate him as promoter of Lewis-Holyfield II
if he's indicted for trying to fix any fights _ is fight for the
Lewis's World Boxing Council title held by Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   There is no telling if Grant is ready for that challenge because
he still often looks like a kid with a lot to learn when he's in
the ring. In fact, there'll be no telling for sure if he's ready
for Savarese until late Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   These days that's what being The Next Great Heavyweight really
means. It means nobody knows if you are or you aren't.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a great physical speciman,'' Savarese said of Grant this
week. ``He's smart in there and he seems very relaxed but he's
still got a lot to learn and I'll be in there to teach him. That's
the objective, right?''
</P>
<P>
   Not if you're The Next Great Heavyweight, it isn't.

TV RATINGS SHOULD BE THE TOUGHEST TO WIN OVER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As televised sports goes, women's soccer is at the bottom of the
pile. That doesn't mean the sport is boring or without its
superstars. Mia Hamm, for instance, has a soccer shoe designed by
Nike named after her and a new Barbie doll modeled after her.
</P>
<P>
   What the sport lacks, however, is a substantial following, one
that transcends the estimated seven million females playing
competitive soccer in America.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge for the Women's World Cup then is not only to
attract live audiences at stadiums across the country but also
solid television ratings and favorable media attention.
</P>
<P>
   That will be easier said than done. The target audience of
soccer moms and dads, 12- to 20-year-old girls, and other members
of the Title IX generation may tune in, but success in the world of
television sports means pulling substantial numbers of men ages 18
to 54. And so far, they aren't clicking their remotes from
football, baseball, basketball, or hockey.
</P>
<P>
   The folks at Disney have made an investment of about $4 million
to cover production costs to televise all 32 games _ either live or
tape delay _ on ABC, ESPN, or ESPN2. Led by Hamm, the US team has a
good shot to win the championship, and a strong showing should
attract casual fans eager to see an American team do well in an
international competition.
</P>
<P>
   The wholesome, family image of women's soccer has attrcated
corporate sponsorship. Nineteen companies, including Adidas,
Gillette, Coca-Cola, and All-State insurance, have put up $6
million.
</P>
<P>
   But, as ESPN analyst Wendy Gebauer said, ``Television has to
take the sport to the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can get viewers to tune in, they will be hooked,'' she
said. ``It's a great product that sells itself. These young women
are role models for young girls and young boys. Mia Hamm is one of
the most recognizable athletes in the world and she is good not
just for women's soccer but sports in general.''
</P>
<P>
   Gebauer was a forward on the American team that won the 1991
World Cup. She retired at age 24 because she couldn't make a living
playing a sport she loved.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sport has changed a lot in eight short years,'' Gebauer
said. ``We were pioneers. We played in front of 65,000 people in
China and it was great. But we had to give up a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   ESPN producer Geoff Mason said television ratings will not be
the sole determinant of whether the tournament is a success, or
whether the US will support a professional women's soccer league in
the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many variables involved with ratings,'' Mason
said, noting that the quality of media coverage coupled with the
level of excitement at the stadiums are just as important.
``Ratings are not the only barometer of the afterlife of women's
soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   Mason said he hopes to attract and satisfy both diehard and
casual fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soccer is an easy sport to televise but a very difficult sport
to televise well,'' Mason said. ``The soccer purists would have us
use one camera to follow the ball. They only want to see the pace
and flow on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mason said good television is not that simple. ``We must try
to bring the viewer into the event,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To accomplish that goal, Mason plans to turn up the audio on
field-level microphones. ``I was somewhat surprised at the amount
of communication among the players,'' he said. ``More audio will
give the viewer a new dimension which is more exciting and more
real. Television lenses let viewers see the event. On-the-field
microphones let viewers feel it.''
</P>
<P>
   What matters most, however, is whether the Americans play well
enough to claim the championship.
</P>
<P>
   Longtime soccer announcer John Paul Dellacamera said the US has
to make it to at least the championship game to attract the casual
fans. ``They don't have to win it all,'' he said. ``But in terms of
creating and maintaining interest in the sport, they have to get to
the final. But we're going to cover the tournament from start to
finish, regardless of how the US team does.''
</P>
<P>
   Play-by-play will be handled by Bob Ley, Derek Rae, and Holly
Rowe. Analysts, in addition to Dellacamera, will be Seamus Malin
and former US men's national team player Ty Keough. ESPN's Chris
McKendry will file reports on the US team throughout the three-week
tournament and will serve as a sideline reporter at all US games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more of a pure game (than men's soccer),'' Dellacamera
said. ``There are fewer stoppages for fouls. There's less of
pulling of jerseys, less acting, less diving, and that sort of
thing. It's a purer game from that standpoint, especially the way
the US plays, with ball possession and stretching the defense. It's
a pretty game to watch as a fan or as an announcer.''

A HARVEST OF TROUBLE FOR TEQUILA FARMERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEQUILA, Mexico _ In the nearly two decades that he has nurtured
the spiky blue agave plants that produce his country's most
cherished drink, Juan Mejia Franco has seen just about every kind
of worm, bug, illness, and threat that the arid hills of western
Mexico can muster.
</P>
<P>
   But now, he is stumped over what is killing the precious source
of tequila these days, a disease that during the last six months
has destroyed thousands of plants that were almost ready for
harvest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started seeing signs last October, and things quickly got
worse,'' Mejia, 53, said as he stood on a slope of barren soil that
had just been cleared of sick agave plants. ``I've never seen
anything like this before. It just starts at the head and works it
way down very fast.''
</P>
<P>
   After enjoying several consecutive years of record production
and sales, Mexico's tequila farmers are facing a more sober
reality. A lethal combination of bacteria and fungus is eroding a
rapidly growing portion of their agave crop, with more than a
quarter of the country's 203 million tequila-producing plants
showing signs of diseases that no one has a cure for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tequila has always been identified with national pride for us,
but this is a side that's not so pleasant, and not many people are
willing to talk about it,'' said Ana Valenzuela Zapata, an
agronomist at the University of Guadalajara and one of Mexico's
leading agave experts. ``It's hard for us to admit that our
national product is in danger, but this is a problem that is
getting worse.''
</P>
<P>
   It couldn't come at a worse time.
</P>
<P>
   A bumper crop of agave in 1992 and 1995 produced a healthy
supply of the distilled drink for store shelves and bars and pushed
the industry past $200 million in sales for the first time.
Marketing mavens from New York City to Tokyo have bolstered the
drink's image from frat house shot to wing-tip sip, attracting new
bottlers and labels.
</P>
<P>
   And the European Union's decision in 1997 to recognize only
Mexican tequila as the real thing has more than doubled sales
across the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   But as America heads into its slushy and margarita-chugging
summer hot season, even industry veterans know that long-term
problems loom _ such as limited supplies of agave and higher prices
for its sweet-tasting core _ unless the diseases can be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could mean the end to many smaller `tequileros' who have
fewer plants and a lower margin of error for their crops,'' said
Luis Yerenas Ruvalcaba, area director for Jose Cuervo, the largest
and oldest tequila producer, which exports about 70 percent of its
liquor to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Mejia's answer for now is to coat his fields with lime to
disinfect and strengthen the soil. Others simply let the plants rot
before trying to plant again. But the truth is no one knows how to
stop these new enemies.
</P>
<P>
   A fungus known as ``fusarium oxisporum'' and a bacteria called
``erwinia caratavora'' are the two most evident diseases that are
being found on the agave plants, which are usually known for their
heartiness through drought and intense heat.
</P>
<P>
   The diseases, known around this tequila-making region as
``plagas,'' are especially dangerous to the plant because they
strike at its core, which is harvested, steamed, and mashed to
extract its sugary sap. The liquid is then mixed with water and
distilled twice before being fermented in barrel casks.
</P>
<P>
   Pure tequila is white. Aging, which can last from 15 days to
several months or even years, produces fuller-tasting,
amber-colored vintages known as reposados or anejos, which are
usually more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Most tequilas sold in the United States are made from 51 percent
agave sugar and 49 percent cane sugar, although production of pure
tequilas _ from 100 percent agave juice _ have more than tripled
during the decade, to more than 375 million liters in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Healthy agave plants mature in eight to 10 years, producing a
round core that is harvested by slicing off the stiff leaves.
Experts say the infected plants begin showing signs of premature
erosion by age three, when leaves begin losing their distinctive
blue-gray color and red lesions start appearing around the base and
a primary stem known as the ``cogollo.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1997 survey conducted by Mexico's Tequila Regulatory Council,
a government agency created in 1994 to monitor the industry,
estimated that 27 percent of the country's agave crop was infected
with at least one of the diseases. Many farmers and scientists say
that figure is higher today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned about the diseases, but we think we have
things under control,'' Ismael Vicente Ramirez, the council's chief
field director, said during an interview at the agency's
headquarters in Guadalajara. ``There's always a risk of illness in
any crop you grow. There's no recipe for stopping it yet, but we
know who our enemy is.''
</P>
<P>
   The council has deployed teams of scientists to analyze the
fungus and bacteria, which has been found only in the fields of
Jalisco state, where most of Mexico's agave is grown.
</P>
<P>
   One idea they are exploring is the creation of a genetically
stronger version of the plant _ created in a laboratory _ that
would be more resistant to illnesses and produce more juice, but
would not disturb the region's ecosystem.
</P>
<P>
   Valenzuela, 35, who has published two books on the agave plant,
said the illnesses have reduced the number of mature plants that
will be available for harvests.
</P>
<P>
   The open market price for agave has jumped 30 percent during the
last three months, she said. Fewer plants will force many smaller
farms and distilleries to shut down.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, tequila companies could make up for shortfalls by
buying similar plants grown in other regions of the country. But
stricter rules ensuring the drink's authenticity prevent
distilleries from doing that now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the smaller producers will do,'' Valenzuela
added, while walking through a field of dead agave that was
recently torched, another method used to cleanse infected fields.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll probably see many of these farmers plant corn or sorghum
instead of gambling on agave, which takes a much longer time to
grow. Or we'll see many of these properties up for sale, which can
destabilize the local economy.''
</P>
<P>
   A reduced supply of agave could also have a significant effect
on the hundreds of new investors who have entered the market during
the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   More than 400 brands of tequila are sold today, most of them by
Johnny-come-lately entrepreneurs who jumped in to take advantage of
the booming market and an excess supply of plants, buying them
cheap and using fancy packaging and high-end pricing to get nearly
$40 a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   The more established tequila-making brands _ the three largest
are Jose Cuervo, Sauza, and Herradura _ have enjoyed double-digit
sales growth annually during the 1990s, and their executives say
they are concerned, but not yet worried, about the diseases. Many
of them have company-funded scientists working on the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made it through other threats, diseases, and even a
couple of revolutions,'' said Yerenas of Cuervo, who says they,
too, have seen the diseases in their plants. ``It's possible this
could get worse before it gets better, but we're strong enough that
we'll make it through.''

BOSNIA'S ROAD TO RECOVERY POCKED WITH LAND MINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia and Herzegovina _ It gets hot early in central
Bosnia these days, and Suad Garibovic is perspiring freely even
before he dons the heavy helmet and straps shrapnel-resistant pads
over his Helly Hansen designer overalls.
</P>
<P>
   But it's when he gets to work that the real sweating starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge minefield _ we think the biggest in the area,''
he says, gesturing with a sweep of his arm toward a gorgeous
pasture where wildflowers, lavender, and purple loosestrife
struggle up through golden, unmown hay. ``These houses were
Croatian. Those were Serb. And this'' _ he points out weed-clogged
trenches running from house to house _ ``this was the front line.''
</P>
<P>
   The field is in Stup, a semiagricultural section of Sarajevo
canton. It has been made a priority for mine removal because there
are former Croatian residents who are interested in returning and
rebuilding their shattered homes here _ the top goal of the foreign
aid agencies and governments striving to restore some semblance of
prewar Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   The task is huge. Bosnia is laced with perhaps a million
landmines and several times that number of unexploded grenades,
rockets, and other explosives that obstruct refugees' return to
their pre-war homes. Conditions are similar in Kosovo, where
refugees trying to return already have run afoul of some of the
hundreds of thousands of mines planted during the 11 weeks Serb
forces were driving out ethnic Albanians and NATO forces were
bombarding the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are killed and injured every day,'' says Ahdin
Orahovac, director of the Mine Action Center of the Federation of
Bosnia and Herzegovina. ``Because of mines, you cannot live like
before the war'' _ the most fervent dream of most Bosnians.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the mines, Orahovac said, an estimated 10 percent
of grenades and other explosives launched during the war in Bosnia
failed to explode.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can be laying on the roof, or in the high grass behind
your apartment,'' he said, noting that a million such weapons were
launched into Sarajevo alone during the nearly four-year siege of
the city by Serbian forces. ``Returning refugees know nothing of
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Garibovic, who fled Republika Srpska, the Serb-run section of
Bosnia, during the war and worked as a part-time manual laborer
before training as a mine remover to make ends meet, knows plenty
about it. When he gets started, he is a study in careful.
</P>
<P>
   First he trims the hay and wildflowers to 20 inches and makes a
visual inspection for tripwires. Then he cuts the growth back
another 8 inches, and looks again. Then, ever so carefully, he cuts
it to about an inch, and begins gently probing the ground with
special tools.
</P>
<P>
   When he finds a land mine, he calls his supervisor, who calls
the group commander, who decides whether the mine can be turned off
with one of the keys he carries in his pocket, or must be
detonated.
</P>
<P>
   This is a particularly dangerous time in the minefields, both in
Bosnia and in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In Bosnia, foreign agencies and governments are giving one last
push to the goal of bringing back refugees. In Kosovo, thousands of
ethnic Albanians are rushing back. In both cases, former residents
are returning to areas that have not been cleared properly.
</P>
<P>
   In late May, one such returnee turned a flock of sheep out into
the field where Garibovic was working, which was not then marked as
a minefield. Twenty animals were killed when they stepped on mines;
28 others were badly maimed.
</P>
<P>
   Four mine clearers were killed in the first 10 days of June,
said Orahovac, who blames the casualties on their loss of
concentration in the hot weather. But some mine removers and
international aid officials say the real cause is the way the
workers are paid by commercial mine-removal companies, 25 of which
are active in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   While projects funded by international agencies such as
Norwegian People's Aid pay by the hour, encouraging mine clearers
to work throughly, commercial firms pay by the square meter,
encouraging them to work quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I, as a de-miner, would not want to go into a field cleared
that way,'' Garibovic said.
</P>
<P>
   Thorough work is at best excruciatingly slowly. And when the
flow of money is reduced, or the attention of donors turns
elsewhere, progress is even more halting.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 5.98 million square yards were cleared of explosives
in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The goal for this year was 9.57 million
square yards _ barely 3 square miles. Because of the slow flow of
pledged funds, however, the clearing effort ran at only 69 percent
of the goal through last month, and would have been much worse
except for an injection of funds from the US and Italy to encourage
refugees to return. The new funds allowed for double the planned
amount of land to be cleared in May.
</P>
<P>
   The World Bank has ponied up $20 million during the past two
years. The United States has committed $28 million over the next
two. Norway and Canada also are major donors to the mine-removal
effort. But these sums are not huge given the magnitude of the
problem, and they may represent the peak of giving.
</P>
<P>
   British Army Major Roland Cockwell, chief of mines for the
international Stabilization Force in Bosnia, refuses to estimate
how long it will take to clear up the problem. That, he says, is
strictly a function of money and attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``After World War II, Western Europe had a much bigger problem,
and it was cleared up in three, four, five years,'' Cockwell says.
``At the current rate of progress here, it will take a helluva long
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commercial firms and nongovernmental organizations will go
where the funding goes,'' Cockwell said, ``and it is already going
south (to Kosovo) and east (to Serbia).''
</P>
<P>
   As those organizations' attentions are drawn to fresher
battlefields, the burden of mine removal in Bosnia will fall
increasingly on units of the armies of Republika Srpska and the
Muslim-Croat federation. However, as things are currently
operating, these soldiers get no extra pay for their hazardous duty
and even their regular pay is often months in arrears.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is little sign of any real commitment to de-mining among
the politicians or the senior military,'' Cockwell says.
</P>
<P>
   Orahovac, the federation's head of mine removal operations, says
the current generation of mine removers can only hope to clear
major urban areas and areas targeted for refugee return, and that
``it will be for the next generation to finish this job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the Olympic committee before the war,'' Orahovac says
mournfully. ``It was very good company. But now we are in very
different company, with Laos, Afghanistan, and Cambodia.''

BUSINESS GROUP URGES DEFEAT OF BAN ON GAY MARRIAGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM HERRON ZAMORA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The San Francisco Chamber of Commerce has become
one of the first major business groups to oppose the ballot measure
that would ban recognition of gay marriages in California.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative ``is a mean-spirited attack that is meant to be
divisive, not to help California come together to grow and prosper
and celebrate its diversity,'' said Rhea Serpan, president and
chief executive officer of the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   The Definition of Marriage initiative, which would define
marriage as a union between a man and woman only, will appear on
the ballot next March 7.
</P>
<P>
   The measure is also commonly referred to as the Knight
initiative after its chief sponsor, state Sen. Pete Knight, a
Republican from Palmdale. Knight has twice failed to win approval
of similar legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``My objective is not to divide anybody in the state of
California,'' Knight said earlier this year. ``My objective is to
maintain the definition of marriage. ... I think the definition
that a marriage is between a man and a woman is one that has been
good for civilization since time immemorial.''
</P>
<P>
   Defeat of the initiative would not legalize gay marriage in
California. A 1977 California law defines marriage as ``a personal
relation ... between a man and a woman.''
</P>
<P>
   But because the U.S. Constitution requires all states to give
``full faith and credit'' to the laws of other states, California
could some day be forced to recognize gay marriages that occur
outside the state.
</P>
<P>
   A poll released in January by the Public Policy Institute of
California showed that 54 percent of those surveyed support the
anti-gay marriage initiative. A 1998 Field poll showed 56 percent
of those surveyed opposed gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of rights for gays say they must spend up to $10
million in an effort to defeat the measure. Celebrities such as the
actress Meg Ryan have signed on to support gay marriage, as have
dozens of organizations, including the American Psychoanalytic
Association and the Japanese-American Citizens League.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, chambers of commerce tend to take moderate or
conservative stands on political issues and often avoid potentially
divisive social disputes that do not directly affect businesses.
But in San Francisco, the chamber tends to reflect the more
tolerant, progressive views of the city. In 1996, the chamber was
the first major business organization to oppose Proposition 209,
which outlawed affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   ``The San Francisco Chamber of Commerce has a proud history of
opposing discrimination in any form,'' Serpan said. ``We strongly
urge others to join us in opposing the Knight initiative.''

THAT PERSISTENT PROBLEM: INFLATION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 20, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My husband and I are ages 39 and 38 and living comfortably on
a $35,000 gross salary. Presently, we have stopped putting aside
money for our retirement and our 30-month-old son's college
education. As of this date we have $120,941 in tax-deferred
retirement funds, with $31,851 in Fidelity Asset Manager Growth,
$18,492 in Fidelity VIP Equity Income, and $4,140 in a life
insurance company's fund. In addition there is $17,730 in Fidelity
Asset Manager and $48,728 in Fidelity Cash Reserves. Where should I
put the cash reserves money so we have a good investment mix? My
financial personality borders on the low end of aggressive; I'm
thinking of putting it in Asset Manager Growth. With what we have
now, could we retire at ages 63 and 62 and live on those dollars as
we have been living on today's dollars, or will we need to continue
saving for retirement? We also have $53,000 cash in a money market
account. I thought I would like to keep $20,000 there for
emergencies and transfer the rest elsewhere, ultimately to be used
for our son's education. What do you suggest?
</P>
<P>
   K.W., Hellertown, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   A. It may look on the surface as if you'll have plenty of
retirement money, but you've overlooked the likely ravages of
inflation. Here's how the numbers work out. Over 24 years, if you
achieved average annual returns of 10 percent, your $120,941 would
grow to $1,191,236. But your living costs will also rise sharply;
if inflation averages 4 percent for those 24 years, you'll need
$89,715 to buy what $35,000 buys today. And to generate such an
income stream you would have to generate a 7.53 percent return from
your nest egg. That, at first seems like a can-do proposition, but
to achieve this safely you would have to put the lion's share of
your nest egg on the fixed-income side, with very little working to
boost your principal.
</P>
<P>
   Let's go back to the growth projection, except this time we'll
assume that both you and your husband managed to put the $2,000
maximum into retirement savings _ optimally in Roth IRAs _ for the
next 24 years. Instead of that $1,191,236 you would have
$1,561,411, and $370,191 of it would be tax-free. You could then
treat the Roth IRAs as your inflation buffer _ continuing to keep
those funds invested in stocks so you will accumulate additional
principal which will protect you from the inflation of the later
years of retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Next, with your biggest positions in money markets and with big
holdings in the Fidelity Asset Manager group, you're not taking too
many risks. Remember, Fidelity Asset Manager holds nearly half its
portfolio in bonds and cash, and even for Asset Manager Growth, the
bond-and-cash figure is in excess of 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   You have a lot of time to ride out the stock market's inevitable
bumps, so I suggest that instead of buying more Asset Manager, you
look at Fidelity Spartan Market Index as the target investment for
all that cash in the money market fund. I'd also like to see a
small amount _ perhaps $10,000 of it, go into Fidelity Select
Health Care. Without such moves, I don't think the projections of
10 percent average annual growth I've used are realistic.
</P>
<P>
   As for your son's college money, consider Fidelity's Freedom
group of funds. These are funds which alter their portfolio makeups
as they approach a target date. Thus Fidelity Freedom 2030 is
designed for people about 30 years away from retirement, and is now
classified by Lipper Analytical Services as a growth and income
fund. The same classification is given to Fidelity Freedom 2020,
but Freedom 2010 has by now evolved into an equity-income fund, and
Freedom 2000 has become a fixed-income fund. It would seem to me
that Fidelity Freedom 2010 would be appropriate for your son,
evolving into a fixed-income holding by the time it reaches its
target date.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My wife and I are both retired. I'm 63 and she's 57. Our
retirement income more than meets our needs. When I turn 70, an
annuity that now pays us $10,000 a year will cease, reducing our
income by about 8 percent. Our current investment portfolio is just
over $500,000 with 10 percent each in individual small company
stocks, Vanguard's Prime Money Market and Vanguard Growth and
Income. We have 20 percent in Scudder Greater European, a similar
amount split between Vanguard Wellington and Vanguard Asset
Allocation, and 30 percent divided evenly among Vanguard Index
Growth, Vanguard Index Value and Vanguard Total Stock Market funds.
At age 70 I intend to start withdrawing not only the $10,000 a year
which we will lose from the expiring annuity, but also any
additional amount to adjust for inflation. Can you give your
opinion of our portfolio and a projection of the impact our
intended withdrawals will have on it should we both be fortunate
enough to live into our 90s?
</P>
<P>
   P.V., Indian Wells, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. I think you should be in pretty good shape. By the time that
annuity runs out, your investment accounts should have grown to
$914,019, presuming average annual growth of 9 percent within the
portfolio. Obviously that could support withdrawals of $10,000 a
year like pie, but of course that won't be the problem. The problem
is maintaining your current $125,000-a-year lifestyle after the
effects of inflation. Let's suppose that since your current income
more than covers your expenses, you'll be able to use that extra
money to deal with the effects of inflation during the next seven
years. But if annual inflation averages 4 percent, by the time
you're 70, you'll need to withdraw $49,491 a year to give you the
$164,491 that would be needed to match your current $125,000 buying
power.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, your savings pool will not only support that, but
would also continue to grow, standing at $1,381,002 by the time
you're 80. At that stage, you'd have to withdraw $128,487 annually
to give you the $243,487 that would provide the same buying power
as your current $125,000.
</P>
<P>
   As for your portfolio, it's certainly fairly bold for the
typical retiree, but given that you won't be drawing on it for
seven years and then only at fairly modest levels, I think the
investment mix is fine. I'd quibble with holding both Vanguard
Index Growth and Index Value (why not just hold Index 500 and get
the same thing?) and I'd rather see a health care fund than the
money market, but by and large it's nicely done.

SUMMER CAMP RIFLERY CLASSES SURVIVE DOUBTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HERMIONE MALONE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Like many people, Philip Lilienthal became sickeningly familiar
with stories of gun violence in public schools this year. In April,
he watched the news in horror as two students at a Colorado high
school fatally shot 13 people with sawed-off shotguns, a
semiautomatic rifle, and a handgun, then took their own lives.
</P>
<P>
   The scenes planted doubt in Lilienthal's mind over whether his
summer camp in Maine should continue to offer riflery to its 150
campers. Some parents expressed concern, too. How could he, in good
conscience, take boys as young as 8 into the woods, hand them a gun
and ammunition, and teach them how to shoot?
</P>
<P>
   How could he not?
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the man with the camp's 80-year reputation on his
shoulders, risked criticism from parents, and said youngsters
deserve the chance to learn how to fire guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``If camp were the only place where rifles were found, I would
do away with the activity,'' Lilienthal, director of Camp Winnebago
in Kents Hill, wrote in a letter to parents. ``Judging from the
abundance of toy guns, sticks transformed by the imagination into
guns, and pointed fingers serving as weapons, it is obvious that
our discontinuation of the activity would not affect their use in
fantasy play.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision was not easy. Many other New England camp directors
are struggling with it, too, shadowed by the Columbine killings as
they clean out cabins and repair rowboats to prepare for this
season's young arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   Most have decided that tradition and training are more important
than bending to antigun trends, though some are considering new
precautions in riflery classes.
</P>
<P>
   Cape Cod Sea Camps in Brewster has pledged to keep its program,
even though some parents have called to say they will not enroll
their boys because the camp offers a riflery class.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've offered it for 50 years. Parents choosing our program
know clearly that's one of the options,'' said associate director
David Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson said the Columbine High School shootings cannot be
solely blamed, because the riflery program turns off a few parents
every year.
</P>
<P>
   The New England Section of the American Camping Association has
been getting some calls from worried parents, too. But the group
says it is not aware of any of the approximately 300 accredited
camps in the region canceling riflery programs this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have taken some calls from parents who have been concerned
about why target sports are even allowed in camps,'' said Bette
Bussel, executive director of the ACA New England section. ``The
majority of them were probably a little upset as to how that could
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   She suggests to parents that they choose a camp without target
sports like archery and riflery, or, alternatively, tell the camp
director that their child should not participate in such
activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still options out there. What children are usually
learning in target sports is proper techniques,'' Bussel said.
</P>
<P>
   Even camps continuing to offer rifle training are emphasizing
caution.
</P>
<P>
   At Camp Winnebago, after discussing the matter with senior staff
and his wife, Lilienthal may consider limiting riflery to older
campers for the first time, rather than offer it to all boys, ages
8 to 18.
</P>
<P>
   Lilienthal said that in 80 years, his camp has never had a
mishap involving guns. He credits that to the way riflery is taught
at the camp. Children learn the dangers of a rifle and how to
safely handle it before they are allowed to touch it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   No targets depicting people or animals are used. Shooting at
anything living, including animals, is strictly forbidden, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not designed in any way to hit something other than a
target,'' Lilienthal said. ``What I hate about guns is that they're
designed to hurt people and we're not encouraging hurting people.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aloha Foundation camps in Fairlee, Vt., say they have had no
riflery-related incidents or injuries involving campers. But that
did not stop the 94-year-old camp from examining whether the
program would continue to be offered this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``In light of Columbine and all of the other things that
happened, I asked my directors to be really clear about why we were
doing riflery, in their own heads,'' said Posie Taylor, executive
director of the foundation, which runs two camps that offer
riflery.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Taylor said, the camp decided to continue to teach
riflery, using long-established safety rules. They include storing
rifles separately from ammunicition, allowing only the head
counselor to have a key to both storage units, teaching campers
clear commands before they even touch the rifles, and keeping the
range a good distance away from the rest of the campground.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of the concerns of its members, the American Camping
Association has generated safety guidelines and messages on youth
violence for its 2,200 accredited camps.
</P>
<P>
   The ACA website gives information on implementing searches of
campers' belongings and training staff to intervene during
potentially violent altercations between campers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shooting at Columbine has been an opportunity for camp
directors to reeducate themselves about safety at camps,'' said Jen
McCormick, ACA spokeswoman. ``You see school shootings almost every
year. There's never been an incident like that at a camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Though McCormick said the national office has not received calls
from concerned parents, the regional office in the Rocky Mountain
section in Colorado did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was right after the shooting at Columbine,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime in late April or early May, two links were added to the
ACA website: ``Youth Violence &AMP; Camper Safety'' and ``Preventing
Violence.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the main concern is not that riflery will contribute
to youth violence, but that isolation will. Being on the fringe
will contribute to that behavior. The camp environment is very
nurturing,'' she said.

BOSTON SCIENTIFIC INSIDERS SAY `BUY' AS THEY SELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Executives from Boston Scientific Corp. were in Houston Thursday
as part of their nationwide tour promoting a planned $500 million
offering of new company stock.
</P>
<P>
   The Natick, Mass. maker of medical devices is selling stock to
pay down part of the debt incurred in its latest acquisition, the
$2.1 billion purchase in September of Schneider Worldwide, a
medical technology unit of Pfizer Inc. Surely, executives are
talking up Boston Scientific's terrific recent quarter and the
addition of new, high-profile chief executive James Tobin.
</P>
<P>
   One detail they probably left off the highlight chart: Insiders
just finished selling about $83 million worth of the same Boston
Scientific shares they are suggesting investors buy.
</P>
<P>
   Five company insiders sold almost 2 million shares from their
personal holdings in the month of May at prices ranging from 39
5/16 to 46, large transactions that have been routinely reported in
company documents.
</P>
<P>
   Chief financial officer Lawrence Best, one of the sellers,
detailed for us the varied reasons why individual insiders decided
to cash in some of their stock last month. Nothing unusual going on
there, he reports.
</P>
<P>
   And that appears to be the case. But Boston Scientific insiders
as a group, though not individually, have demonstrated a keen
ability to buy low and sell high when it comes to their own
historically volatile stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``They appear to be very good timers,'' said Robert Gabele, who
tracks insider transactions for First Call/Thomson Financial and
reviewed Boston Scientific activity over the last two years.
``That's pretty good correlation. It's about as good as it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston Scientific insiders were buyers just a few months ago,
from Dec. 28 through Feb. 26, when the stock traded in a range from
23 5/16 to 28 1/2. The shares soon traded up above 40 and remained
there this week, finishing Thursday at 42 1/16.
</P>
<P>
   Company insiders were also sellers between March and August last
year, shortly before Boston Scientific stock sunk from above 40 to
below 25.
</P>
<P>
   Insiders bought or sold as a group three times in 1997, in each
case getting in before the stock moved up or selling shortly before
a slump. The transactions were sometimes relatively small and
typically involved different company managers or directors on each
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's anything that has an odor to it,'' said
Best. ``But I can't deny it that when you go through the facts it
leads you to speculate.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's what we wonder about: If insiders have built such a canny
trading record, does the fact that they are selling now mean
anything?
</P>
<P>
   No way, said Best. He insisted the insider trades were a group
of unrelated transactions that didn't amount to a hill of beans.
</P>
<P>
   Take John Abele, cofounder of Boston Scientific and one of New
England's richest people because of his stake in the company. He
sold more than 1 million shares last month, cashing in about $45
million of stock.
</P>
<P>
   Abele, who still owns more than 62 million shares, no longer has
an active role in the company. He sold shares to help fund an
institute he is building in Vermont and to support other
philanthropic interests, according to Best.
</P>
<P>
   Best himself sold 619,472 shares in May, mostly reflecting a
deal he cut with Boston Scientific when he joined the company seven
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Best said he received 500,000 options when he signed on with the
understanding that he could sell them later to diversify and reload
an equal number of new options. He said that was exactly what
happened last month.
</P>
<P>
   The third big seller last month, Joseph Ciffolillo, retired as
Boston Scientific's chief operating officer three years ago. Best
said Ciffolillo was in a use-or-lose option situation because
retirees are required to cash out within 36 months of leaving the
company. ``Joe's options were going to expire in June if he didn't
exercise them,'' said Best.
</P>
<P>
   Put the three big traders together, he said, and they don't
signify anything in particular. Each happened to have their own
reasons to sell during an available ``window,'' a period when all
recent news has been aired and insiders are allowed to conduct
transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you should draw any conclusions with regard to
the insider sales and our fundamentals,'' he said. ``Our business
fundamentals have never been stronger in our history.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street, which has hammered Boston Scientific stock before,
seems to agree. Of 30 analysts who cover the company, 27 recommend
it with a rating of ``buy'' or better.
</P>
<P>
   But the bumpy ride of Boston Scientific stock can be traced in
part to its rapid-fire acquisition spree, a string of at least a
dozen deals costing $6 billion in the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   Now the company is swallowing one of the biggest purchases of
all, and the insiders, coincidentally or not, are telling us to pay
attention.

MORE BITTER MEDICINE FOR THE SERBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If not us, who? That is the ultimate question the United States,
as sole surviving superpower, has to ask itself every time
something big goes wrong somewhere and the world demands: Who can
fix it?
</P>
<P>
   Just days after our air power back-bones the NATO war that
forced the murderous Serb regime to capitulate, the White House
dispatches warships to stand by in the naval shoot-up between North
and South Korea. And the United States shoulders its way
diplomatically into the nasty India-Pakistan border brawl over
Kashmir, which has led to shelling by one new nuclear power of
another and what we used to label ``invasion.''
</P>
<P>
   As 50,000 NATO peacekeeping troops enter battered Kosovo, the
British government announces dread evidence of what everyone
suspected: The Serbs massacred at least 10,000 Albanians and
stuffed their bodies in mass graves.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the ailing pope retraces his roots in his
much-warred-over Poland, wringing his hands over the 20th century's
bloodstained course, the United States stands alone as the one
power that can project military force anywhere it wants.
</P>
<P>
   That responsibility cuts both ways. China is angry because some
errant NATO bombs killed three Chinese diplomats in Belgrade.
Russia, smarting under its demotion from the Other Superpower to a
backward kleptocracy unable to wring concessions for its
troublemaking Serb cousins.
</P>
<P>
   We search for the roots of the Balkan conflict, and the search
takes us to the beginning of this century. The Serb government of
the day was linked to the archduke's murder, and we were off to the
races that made ours the worst century for slaughter on record.
</P>
<P>
   It was World War I that triggered the bloodshed still drenching
Europe. ``A tragic and unnecessary conflict,'' begins British
military historian John Keegan's detective-like dissection of the
corpse of 20th century warfare in his new book, ``The First World
War.''
</P>
<P>
   The first great war of the century killed 10 million Europeans,
but it also ``destroyed the benevolent and optimistic culture of
the European continent,'' and the 50 million dead of World War II
``was the direct outcome of the First.''
</P>
<P>
   It began, as this century ends, with murder in the Balkans: the
assassination of the Archduke Ferdinand in Sarajevo. And Keegan
fingers Serbia as ``the worst proportionate sufferer'' Of the 5
million Serbs of the prewar population, 125,000 were killed or died
as soldiers, but another 650,000 civilians succumbed to privation
or disease, making a total of 15 percent of the population lost,
compared with something between 2 and 3 percent of the British,
French, and German populations.''
</P>
<P>
   Loss of life proportionally five to seven times that of the
principal belligerents colors Balkan history and haunts the Serbs
still. But no great cities were destroyed by aerial bombardment in
World War I, which was essentially rural trench warfare, without
the mechanical contrivances _ tanks, bombers, high-powered
artillery, and submarines _ that made World War II so frightful and
industrialized battlefield killing power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The First, unlike the Second World War, saw no systemic
displacement of populations, no deliberate starvation, no
expropriation, little massace or atrocity.'' In some ways, ``a
curiously civilized war.''
</P>
<P>
   But the psychological burden on victim and vanquished alike
proved too great to bear. ``It damaged civilization, the rational
and liberal civilization of the European enlightenment, permanently
and for the worse,'' Keegan writes, ``and, through the damage done,
world civilization also.''
</P>
<P>
   The rule of law, and the aspiration for democracy, collapsed and
died, ``in Russia after 1917, in Italy after 1922, in Germany in
1933, in Spain after 1936.'' Liberalism gave way to totaliarianism,
and men of iron will and black soul, the Milosevics of their era:
Lenin, Stalin, Hitler, Mussolini, and Franco.
</P>
<P>
   Keegan's grim formula could be Milosevic's grisly text as the
Serb despot started four Balkan wars this past decade:
``Totalitarianism was the continuation of war by other means. It
uniformed and militarized its mass electoral following, while
depriving voters generally of their electoral rights, exciting
their lowest political instincts and marginalizing and menacing all
internal opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Serbs flee NATO's pursuing soldiers, killing, maiming,
mining, looting, and burning as they go back to Belgrade, doomed to
be denounced anew, dreading the inevitable reprisals of the KLA and
Albanian terrorists, repeating the cycle of centuries of
intolerance. There has to be a lot of self-hate at the root of
causes in which men slaughter livestock, rape and pillage, poison
wells, and mark their retreat with animal-like coarseness.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs leave Kosovo the way they came in: drunk on history,
blinded by blood lust, doomed to swallow again some of their own
bitter medicine, demonized by their own bestial behavior.
</P>
<P>
   They still don't get it. But someone had to stop them. And that
someone, in the current global geopolitical lineup, had to be us.

WHY DID BAY STATE GIVE A GRANT TO SMITH &AMP; WESSON? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Massachusetts is either beating guns into garden mowers or
outrageously helping a company mow us down.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Division of Employment and Training gave $1.6
million in grants to train 1,400 workers. Some grantees were
mom-and-apple-pie institutions such as the YMCA. Others have the
All-America image of Spaulding Sports. Others symbolize uplift,
such as Holyoke Community College. Others symbolize the new
economic drift, such as SpringBoard Technology.
</P>
<P>
   But one firm leapt off the list like a flash fire from bacon
grease. It long ago lost its apple-pie image, so much so that it
has to be asked why the state considers it a source of uplift. One
of the grantees was Smith &AMP; Wesson.
</P>
<P>
   Springfield's Smith &AMP; Wesson is the world's top producer of
handguns. The state awarded the company $35,000. The cash ranked
only 10th among the 14 companies that are training workers for
actual jobs. But Smith &AMP; Wesson will get more bang for its buck
(pun intended) than most of the other firms. The number of workers
to be trained, 110, ranked fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Both the state and Smith &AMP; Wesson insist that this is not a case
of literally getting a bang for the bucks. Both said the 110 new
workers will be trained in a separate nongun division of the
company, a division that takes the technology used to heat, harden,
and protect gun metal and use it for lawn blades, automotive gears,
golf clubs, and medical equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Jack King, deputy director of the DET, said Smith &AMP; Wesson was a
``sensible'' choice, since the company presented itself
``attempting to diversify into contract machining for nonfirearm
activities.'' While the gun-making side of Smith &AMP; Wesson has
declined from 2,000 in the '70s to about 750 today, Specialty
Services, the division involved in the training grant, has 120
people. Business being brought in by the division is reportedly
growing at 30 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   King said the nongun jobs can pay $14 an hour, no chicken feed
in a depressed urban area where English is often a second language.
The jobs require more skill than gun making involves, since workers
do different things for different companies. At Smith &AMP; Wesson, CEO
Ed Shultz has said he hopes the nongun business will expand from
its current 10 percent of the company's revenues to over 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we're doing well, and we're having fun with these
new businesses,'' Shultz said.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether Shultz should have such fun at the
taxpayer's expense. Before giving the state a clean bill of sanity
for this grant, there are several things to consider. It would be
one thing if Smith &AMP; Wesson came to the state saying they
desperately wanting to stop making handguns. If that was true, the
state should throw $35 million at them to retool the joint. At $318
per trainee, according to the state, that beats state welfare for
sports stadiums. Studies show that using stadiums to create jobs
costs upwards of $200,000 per job.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith &AMP; Wesson is still shamelessly aggressive about
handguns. It is hard to see how the state can grant public funds to
a company at a time when it is being sued by the state's capital
city for the devastation caused by its products. Smith &AMP; Wesson is
named in most of the 20 city lawsuits filed around the nation for
irresponsible marketing and distribution practices that led to
murder sprees that drain city resources.
</P>
<P>
   It hard to view the grant as ``sensible'' when the firm shows no
sensibility about the carnage. Even though scores of children
killed in gang shootings are innocent bystanders, Shultz said he
has ``no emotion'' on gang shootings. ``As a matter of fact,'' he
has said, ``I just hope they're both good shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith &AMP; Wesson is also coy as to whether there is a permanent
firewall between the gun factory and the nongun metal finishing
factory. All that Jorgensen would say was that on occasion, some
gun workers are used in Specialty Services. He said he was not
aware of any metal finishers being used to make guns, but was also
not aware of any policy against such a use.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control advocate Tom Diaz said a firewall might be
irrelevant anyway. ``Capital is fungible,'' said the author of
``Making a Killing, The Business of Guns in America,'' and senior
policy analyst at the Violence Policy Center. ``The money the state
gives Smith &AMP; Wesson to train workers in one area is money Smith &AMP;
Wesson can keep for profit or invest in making more guns. . . . I
don't know what metal products they are making, but they should be
making gurneys for trauma centers. Then they have the front end and
the back end of the business covered.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the state knows for sure that its fronting of training
funds is helping Smith &AMP; Wesson to back out of the gun industry, it
has no business doing business with the company. That will be a
while. Handgun sales are up this year. ``We will be in the gun
business until we are legislated out of it,'' Jorgensen said.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the government issued a study on gun crime by 18- to
20-year-olds. Smith &AMP; Wesson handguns were three of the top 10
weapons most frequently traced to crime. It is naive to think Smith
&AMP; Wesson is beating guns into garden mowers. Its weeds on the
killing fields remain too high and thick to mow down.

TIM DUNCAN OF SPURS OFFERS SUBSTANCE INSTEAD OF STYLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ He is the anti-MTV, anti-slacker,
anti-showboating, anti-smack-talking antidote to the next
generation of wannabe stars.
</P>
<P>
   In a world that worships style, Tim Duncan insists on offering
substance. In a country where delayed gratification is going the
route of rotary telephones, Duncan spent four years honing his
skills _ and earning a degree _ at Wake Forest before striking it
rich in the National Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   In a league where players craft and cash in on images of
outrageousness and rebelliousness, Duncan dares to harbor bland
ambition.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan is the anti-anti-hero. He has so much game, he gets
noticed for all the right reasons. No dying his hair lime green. No
talking enough trash to make the landfills of New Jersey overflow.
No making a fool out of himself in a wrestling ring. No wrapping
his hands around a coach's neck.
</P>
<P>
   If the San Antonio Spurs' 89-77 victory in Game 1 of the NBA
Finals is even the slightest hint of things to come, then it's
going to be a long short series for the New York Knicks. Duncan
poured in 33 points, snagged 16 rebounds, all but swept the Knicks
out of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way Duncan's playing now, there's not one man on the
planet who can stop him,'' Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ``He's
the best player in the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy admiringly describes Duncan's game as ``a coaching
clinic.'' At 7 feet and 255 pounds, Duncan combines the strength of
a lumberjack with a dancer's footwork. Duncan was the only player
to rank among the NBA's top 10 in scoring (21.7 points per game),
rebounding (11.4), blocked shots (2.52) and field-goal percentage
(.495) during the lockout-shortened regular season.
</P>
<P>
   All-NBA First Team. All-Defensive First Team. And Duncan is only
23. He has so much time for his game _ and reputation _ to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably a little young to be a legend yet,'' Spurs coach
Gregg Popovich said. ``I'm willing to call him that if you want, if
he's going to do this every night.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammates refer to Duncan as ``The Big Easy.'' Anybody who has
seen Duncan play knows that the nickname is self-explanatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tough guy to guard one-on-one,'' Knicks forward Marcus
Camby said, ``and he's even tougher to guard when you double-team
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan, in other words, is smart and unselfish enough to pass
the ball to the open man if defenders converge on him. Opponents
might figure out Duncan a little easier if he would occasionally
wear his emotions on sleeve. Maybe that's the method to Duncan's
reluctance to show madness, or gladness, or sadness. Duncan, after
all, did get his degree in psychology.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a real strange bird in the sense that ... he's mature for
his age,'' Popovich said. ``He has got this natural disposition. I
always say he's on island time, where nothing fazes this guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Duncan hails from St. Croix, Virgin Islands. He used to be a
competitive swimmer, until Hurricane Hugo destroyed the local pool
in 1989. He didn't take up organized basketball until the ninth
grade. Then and only then did he began to pay attention to anything
or anybody having to do with the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan didn't score a point in his first college game, playing
10 minutes. Less than four years later, Duncan was the prize of the
1997 draft lottery. Duncan was almost as big a winner as the Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of breaking in with the Los Angeles Clippers or some
other NBA ne'er-do-wells, Duncan had the luxury of playing
alongside All-Star and fellow 7-footer David Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect to come on this quickly,'' said Duncan, the
ninth rookie in history to make the All-NBA First Team. ``But I'm
in a great situation. The coaches really put me in situations where
I can be effective. It feels good out there right now.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, it feels a lot different than when the Spurs began
this season by losing eight of their first 14 games. Locals were
willing to give Popovich a one-way ticket anywhere, as long as he
went out of town and never came back. Skeptics wondered if there
was enough room on one team for Duncan and Robinson. Spurs guard
Mario Elie questioned the intensity and commitment of the team's
big men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no reaction,'' Duncan said. ``I kept on playing. It
really doesn't bother me what people say about me. I think I play
as hard as anybody out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the Spurs righted themselves, they became as unstoppable as
oat bran. They have won 43 of their past 49 games, including 11 in
a row during the playoffs. Along the way, Duncan and Robinson have
evolved into the most potent combination this side of tequila and
sunrise.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love passing it to each other,'' said Robinson, a career
25-points-per-game scorer whose average dropped to 15.8 this
season. ``We love taking care of each other on the floor. There's
such trust. We don't feel like things are ever out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   For reasons best left to mystics to explain, Duncan finished
only third in the league's Most Valuable Player voting. The further
the Spurs go in the playoffs, the closer his reputation comes to
its rightful stature.
</P>
<P>
   ``All it means,'' Duncan said, ``is there's a bigger bounty on
your head.''
</P>
<P>
   He is the anti-MTV antidote to the next generation of NBA
anti-heroes. If the NBA is truly lucky, he is the future. The
brightest star of all.

DISNEY'S ANIMATED `TARZAN' MAKES THE LEAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
TARZAN 
Directed by: Kevin Lima, Chris Buck 
Screenplay by: Tab Murphy, Bob Tzudiker, Noni White (based on Edgar
Rice Burroughs' stories) 
With the voices of: Tony Goldwyn, Minnie Driver, Glenn Close, Brian
Blessed, Lance Henriksen, Nigel Hawthorne, Wayne Knight, Alex D.
Linz, Rosie O'Donnell 
Running time: 88 minutes 
Rated: G 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There have been 47 Tarzan movies, but not until the 48th has
there been an animated ``Tarzan.'' Yet Edgar Rice Burroughs
discussed one with Walt Disney in the 1930s, and in some ways
drawing boards and now computer keyboards are the best routes to
the material. For one thing, they allow Tarzan to do the kind of
vine-swinging that not even Johnny Weissmuller in his prime could
have managed. Tarzan's jungle, given that it always has been a
jungle of the mind, looks better than almost all of Hollywood's
scraggly backlot attempts at the real thing. It's a little much
that Tarzan, as drawn, seems as much a mantis as a man, with no
waist to speak of and bulging thigh muscles. But the main thing is
that Disney's new animated ``Tarzan'' works.
</P>
<P>
   It's the strongest Disney animation of the last few years, a
strapping and satisfyingly crafted effort that will do a better job
of leading young audiences into Tarzaniana than yet another
traditional movie could have. The Disney animation canon, which
seems to have lost momentum with its last few offerings, should be
nudged forward again by ``Tarzan.'' It's lively, vividly drawn,
flecked with emotion without being drenched by it, and finally
addresses the question of what to do with the songs, which lately
have become the wrong kind of show-stopper. Instead of stopping the
action for bland generic pseudo-emotions, this new batch by Phil
Collins smartly stays in the background, effectively heightening
the moods and reinforcing the momentum, although sometimes
overdoing the drums.
</P>
<P>
   But there is momentum as ``Tarzan'' largely retains the familiar
story, making only a few departures. We don't see the grown Tarzan
until well into the film. It begins with the infant son of
shipwrecked parents orphaned when mother and father are killed in
their treehouse by a predatory leopard. The baby is rescued and
adopted by a kind gorilla mother who lost her own baby. His boyhood
as something of a freak in the gorilla clan ends when he comes of
age and exhilaratingly goes zooming through the trees. The
traditional Disney comic relief, less memorable than usual on this
occasion, is provided by a cowardly elephant voiced by Wayne Knight
and Tarzan's gorilla playmate, voiced by Rosie O'Donnell. It's a
relief that this ``Tarzan'' eliminates the problematic but
perennial Hollywood characters of Boy and Cheetah.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn Close's voice is a plus as Tarzan's nurturing adoptive
mother and Tony Goldwyn's is more than up to the task of voicing
Tarzan's conflicts when humans enter the picture. Minnie Driver
finds an agreeable zone between sappy and forbidding as Jane, and
Nigel Hawthorne is on the money as her dotty Victorian father.
Brian Blessed handles with plummy aplomb the bad-guy slot provided
by the father-daughter team's great white hunter guide, Clayton,
who looks like Basil Rathbone on steroids. Predictably, Tarzan and
the gorillas are far more civilized than the intruders, and the
film can be not only forgiven but applauded for taking a different
path than Burroughs did when it comes to Tarzan's decision on
whether to follow Jane back to England.
</P>
<P>
   The screenplay smartly makes the disruption of the jungle
environment seem a consequence of the colonizing imperative itself
rather than the barbarous acts of a few aberrant individuals. The
animation process takes full advantage of the greater possibilities
for human-animal interaction than any live version could offer. The
drawing style is more traditional than innovative, not a bad thing,
except that it hasn't exactly achieved seamlessness between
differently styled renderings. If this ``Tarzan'' steers itself
away from the primal emotions that would have given it some points
of contact with the very top echelon of Disney animated classics,
it's not far below them. This ``Tarzan'' won't wither on the vine.

THE TROUBLE WITH JOE MCGINNISS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was supposed to be author Joe McGinniss's comeback book. Now
it's just another messy publishing headache.
</P>
<P>
   McGinniss, who attracts trouble the way trailer parks attract
tornadoes, has just published ``The Miracle of Castel di Sangro,''
the story of a back-country Italian soccer team that achieves
unexpected national prominence. The book has received some very
nice reviews, and has been promoted in conspicuously placed
advertisements in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, McGinniss has declared war on his publisher.
</P>
<P>
   In a five-page-long hysterical e-mail message titled
``Arrivederci, Sarah'' _ distributed to ``friends and associates''
for maximum leaking potential _ McGinniss rails against Little,
Brown's publisher Sarah Crichton, and his editor, Michael Pietsch.
Nominally, the dispute concerns a ``quote ad,'' a full-page
advertisement that publishers award to books that have received
favorable notices. But in reality, the argument plumbs writing's
true heart of darkness _ an author's wounded pride.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that, like all editors, Crichton professed to
love the book; ``It is so original, so human. . . . It is
intoxicating,'' she wrote to McGinniss. In fact, even after
McGinniss's e-mail blitzes, she still likes the book: ``We love
it,'' she told me. ``It's a terrific read.'' But, like many editors
in her situation, she will not commit to further promotional
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   According to Crichton and McGinniss the book had problems during
Little, Brown's standard legal review. Likewise, the cover, which
is still terrible, had to be redone three times. ``Joe didn't like
the first two jackets,'' Crichton says. ``This was the one he
wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinniss complains in his e-mail that Barnes &AMP; Noble and
amazon.com have not honored agreements to properly promote the
book. And what promotion has been done he doesn't like. ``I have
never understood the billing of this as a `Father's Day' book,'' he
writes. ``I think it has about as much to do with Father's Day as
`Fear of Flying' has to do with Mother's Day.''
</P>
<P>
   So he attacks Crichton, a well-regarded New York publishing
personality and the daughter of novelist Robert Crichton, who is
best known for a novel (``The Secret of Santa Vittoria'') that
takes place in an Italian countryside not so different from that of
Castel di Sangro. ``I realize that while your father was an author,
and a fine one, you are a businesswoman, a very different breed,''
McGinniss writes. Astonishingly, he suggests that Teddy Kennedy,
the subject of McGinniss's botched biography ``The Last Brother,''
or someone else ``acting in his behalf,'' may have influenced
Crichton to undercut ``Castel.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he goes after Pietsch, who refused to authorize a modest
travel expense for McGinniss: ``Any Harvard graduate who does not
know the difference between Andover and Amherst, as Michael did not
. . . might be said to be, at the least, unversed in the
practicalities of life.'' Reached at his home in Williamstown,
McGinniss declined to speak with me.
</P>
<P>
   McGinniss is a complicated fellow, a hugely talented former
sportswriter who burst onto the book scene with his superb
``Selling of the President, 1968.'' His more recent outings have
been fraught with controversy. His book about former Green Beret
Jeffrey MacDonald, ``Fatal Vision,'' sold a gazillion copies but
landed him in some serious hot water. McGinniss found himself to be
the subject of perhaps the most famous New Yorker profile of the
last 20 years, Janet Malcolm's ``Reflections: The Journalist and
the Murderer.'' Malcolm reported that McGinniss strung MacDonald
along as an interview source, never sharing his belief that
MacDonald was guilty of murdering his wife and children.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, McGinniss published ``The Last Brother,'' ``an
embarrassingly bad book,'' according to Globe reviewer Gail
Caldwell. Much attention was devoted to a disclaimer attached to
the book: ``Some thoughts and dialogue attributed to figures in
this narrative were created by the author. . . . '' That statement
gave Kennedy spear carriers all the ammunition they needed to
discredit the biography as the product of an overheated
imagination.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his anti-Little, Brown screed, McGinniss writes:
``I don't think I'll write another book.'' If ``Castel'' is as
charming as Joe's fans say it is, he should write a dozen more
books. And perhaps less e-mail.

`VIOLIN' STRIKES JUST THE RIGHT CHORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDVINS BEITIKS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The best word to describe the new film from director Francois
Girard, ``The Red Violin,'' is ``beautiful.'' Simply, beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   The film tells the story of a violin created by an Italian
master in the 17th century and the way it affects a long parade of
lives. From its inception, when it was created for the anticipated
son of Nicolo Bussotti's pregnant wife, the red violin crosses time
and space, sound and light, as it carries both Anna Bussotti's soul
and the crazed love of her husband across the centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back from present-day Montreal, where the violin is
being auctioned, ``The Red Violin'' guides the music in the
instrument through the music in the lives that come to touch it.
</P>
<P>
   Filmed in Montreal, Oxford, Vienna, Shanghai and Cremona, Italy,
``The Red Violin'' makes the most of its backgrounds while telling
a broad, romantic story, on the same scale of love and lust and
human frailty as the Academy Award-winning ``The English Patient.''
</P>
<P>
   The photography, by Alain Dostie, is stunning. So is the
production design of Francois Seguin, who creates images in the
brush strokes of Vermeer and David, Constable and Bocklin. And then
there's the music of John Corigliano, whose compositions for the
red violin hit just the right notes.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the only false note in the film is one the producers
probably thought of as an unqualified plus _ the inclusion of
Samuel L. Jackson in the cast.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who plays a contemporary expert in violins attending
the Montreal auction, is an intrusion into the film. It's not that
he's miscast _ he does his usual outstanding job _ it's just that
``Red Violin'' is the kind of film that works best without
well-known faces.
</P>
<P>
   Before Jackson takes center stage, each actor makes a strong
impression. Carlo Cecchi and Irene Grazioli couldn't be better as
Nicolo and Anna Bussotti, while Anita Laurenzi has both the face
and words to bring alive the family soothsayer, a believer in a
future beyond Cremona. Jean-Luc Bideau is brilliant as Georges
Poussin, teacher of the equally brilliant Christoph Koncz, one of
the most unassuming child actors you'll ever see. Jason Flemyng and
Greta Scacchi do a fine turn as Victorian lovers in the Oxford
segment, which follows on the heels of an oddly affecting
kaleidoscope of gypsy violinists.
</P>
<P>
   The violin moves with a servant from Oxford to China, then
teeters on the brink of extinction as the dehumanizing new order
vows to destroy all Western influences. Standout performances from
Sylvia Chang and Liu Zi Feng melt into the color and sound of China
brought both loudly and softly to the front of the screen. The
Shanghai sequence, lopsided and strident, is riveting.
</P>
<P>
   At times the grandeur of past centuries is spread too thick,
especially in Vienna, where even the poor dress like kings. But
that grandeur serves the film well _ it is only when ``The Red
Violin'' settles into 20th century Montreal and the
all-too-recognizable mannerisms of Jackson that the story starts to
flag.
</P>
<P>
   Girard tries to inject the Montreal scenes with suspense by
replaying the bidding process, adding new insights every time, but
the true suspense of ``The Red Violin'' comes not from what will
happen to the instrument at the auction, but what happened to the
people whose lives became part of it over the years.
</P>
<P>
   The most affecting scenes are those showing how Bussotti created
his violin, how it made its journey from the casket of Kaspar Weiss
to the garden room of Frederick Pope to the guarded loft of a
teacher in Shanghai. By the time Jackson takes over the screen, the
best of ``The Red Violin'' has passed.

HOW TO TREAT OLD HOMASOTE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. In painting the inside of my house, I came across two rooms
whose walls are Homasote. One room is papered, one is painted. In
both rooms I can see the joints between the Homasote panels. Can I
fill them with spackling or joint compound before painting or
papering?
</P>
<P>
   SUE MICHAELS, Newton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. It's interesting; this is the second question this week on
Homasote. First, Homasote needs explaining. It is a papier-mache
material, ground-up newspapers wetted down and compressed into
half-inch-thick sheets. It was popular in the 1930s to 1950s, and
often was used in summer cottages. It has a rough, pebbly surface,
and joints are usually covered with a double-sided molding. While
popular so long ago, it is still being made by the Homasote Co.,
which makes other products such as sound-absorbing board and carpet
underlayment.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its rough surface, it is not practical to fill the
joints with spackling or joint compound, then taping the joints as
one would do with dry wall. The filler is smooth and it is
impossible to match the rough finish.
</P>
<P>
   You could cover the joints with molding, but that's not
attractive unless the joints are lined up nice and square.
</P>
<P>
   But, you could fill the joints of the Homasote you plan to
paper; apply glue size to the wall, let dry, and paper.
</P>
<P>
   And, here is another way: Fill all joints with joint compound,
sand smooth, tape as necessary (it is a good idea anyway), apply
glue size, and apply a heavy-duty wallpaper called Coverall, sold
in wallpaper shops and designed to smooth very rough walls. It can
be painted or papered over.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I can't find replacements for old-fashioned hidden, interior
hinges for my kitchen cabinets, which I am redoing, and some which
are missing some hinges. Where can I find some?
</P>
<P>
   OLD HINGE LOVER
</P>
<P>
   A. You could try antiques stores, especially those that
specialize in tools and hardware. Don't expect much success; you
may find one or two, but if you need 10, the quest must continue.
Or, try the Rockler Woodworker's Store catalog (800-279-4441),
which carries many modern but concealed hinges. Or, try the Van
Dyke's Restorers catalog, 800-558-1234. The Van Dyke's catalog
listed a ``Concealed Hinge'' and an ``Invisible Concealed Hinge.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. The color of an Oriental rug bled through to the wall-to-wall
carpeting underneath, making a stain. Cleaning faded the stain just
a little. The cleaner does not want to use harsh chemicals on the
stain. What will remove the stain?
</P>
<P>
   GEORGE VADALA, Brighton, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If cleaning reduced the stain a little, I think more cleaning
will reduce it further. You can't blame the cleaner for not wanting
to use harsh chemicals, but you could try dabbing a bit of dry
cleaning fluid on the stain to see what will happen. Spot check
first.
</P>
<P>
   If that doesn't work, try this one: 1 cup ammonia, 1/2 cup
vinegar, 3 tablespoons baking soda, all in 1/2 bucket of water.
Spot test first.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if nothing else works, consider having the wall-to-wall
carpet dyed. They are in the Yellow Pages, and some will dye the
carpet where it lies.
</P>
<P>
   To prevent the Oriental from further bleeding, put a plastic pad
under the Oriental.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I installed a water heater recently, and not too long
afterwards the pressure-relief valve leaked. I replaced it, and it
was OK for a month, but the new one leaked. What can I do?
</P>
<P>
   MIKE BROOKS, Malborough, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Put in another, or have a pro put one in, then blame him if
it fails. These valves are sensitive and persnickety, and I think
it is a matter of keeping trying until something works. In fact,
there is an unwritten rule that you should set off the valve once
every six months or so to make sure it continues to work. Trouble
is, when you do that, it is likely to leak. That's life.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am putting in pressure-treated deck boards, one-inch-thick
boards 6 inches wide. What is best to install them: nails or
screws? Also, some of the boards that are 12 feet long, and have
crooks and curves, which I think will be impossible to straighten
even secured to the framework. What can I do with them?
</P>
<P>
   MIKE MELANSON, Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Screws are better than nails, and hidden fasteners are better
than screws because there are no screw or nail heads showing.
</P>
<P>
   As for the curved boards, they will curve even more when they
continue drying out. Return them for straighter ones, and
definitely return any warped (cupped) ones, because it is
impossible to straighten a warped board. If that cannot be done,
cut them to shorter lengths, but lengths that will touch joints at
each end. The shorter the boards, the less curved they will be, and
you might be able to straighten them while installing them. You may
have a number of short boards but, but if they butt each other over
a joist and you don't line up the butt joints, no one will know
unless you proudly show them your handywork.

BEAUTIFULLY DRAWN `ARTIST'S WIDOW' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE WHITE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE ARTIST'S WIDOW 
By Shena Mackay 
Moyer Bell, 151 pp., $21.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shena Mackay's ``The Artist's Widow'' opens in a Mayfair art
gallery on a rainy summer night, at a private viewing: ``John
Crane, 1918-1996: The Last Paintings.'' Crane's widow, Lyris, an
artist in her own right, is not enjoying herself.
</P>
<P>
   The gallery is hot, noisy, crowded with pseuds and strivers,
``the sort of party John and Lyris Crane hated.'' Lyris's new shoes
are killing her. She'd rather be at home alone, painting, in her
run-down house in south London, but she knows that she must pull
herself together, for John's sake.
</P>
<P>
   Mackay is a British novelist whose work invites and rewards
rereading. In her five previous novels she has shown herself an
intensely wise and humane writer, and very funny too. ``The
Artist's Widow'' is slyly satirical about the contemporary London
art world, but as always, Mackay's wit is tempered with sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   During the opening reception the gallery's on-the-make owner
drapes his arm around Lyris ``in a proprietal yet patronizing way,
trapping her and reminding her of a snake that a man had slung
around her neck once in Tangiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Pursey, Lyris's dreadful great-nephew, a conceptual
artist who works in various media (raw entrails among them),
crashes the party to promote his own career. ``Jacob, my man! Just
the bloke I'm looking for!'' Nathan is heard saying as he corners a
venerable Jewish painter. ``You know that Kristallnacht thingy in
Berlin . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a group of strangers has converged on Lyris and
presented her with a sheaf of bronze lilies _ ``so kindly intended
and such a blasted nuisance,'' thinks Lyris.
</P>
<P>
   Readers of ``The Orchard on Fire,'' Mackay's masterful novel
about child abuse, know her skill at conveying paradox and
ambiguity. Her characters are idiosyncratic and contradictory. Even
the least appealing of them have saving graces. And the best of
them are fallible. Mackay's style is a constant surprise, full of
abrupt changes of tone, suddenly lyrical, abruptly satirical.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the plot centers on Lyris, and various people's plans to
use her. Nathan thinks his elderly aunt has a valuable collection
of art, and conspires with his semi-criminal father, Buster, to
acquire the imaginary hoard. (Buster, a flower dealer, wonders if
Lyris is ``compost mentis.'') Zoe Rifaat, a conniving documentary
filmmaker, has designs on Lyris's life story for her film about
``neglected women artists.'' Nathan's pathetic former girlfriend,
Jackee, thinks Lyris with her ``wise, kind'' face might be the one
person who could love her ``more than anybody else in the world for
ever.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lyris is not the woman any of these scheming younger people
imagine her to be. She's sharper than all of them put together. A
serious painter nearly all her life, Lyris is appalled by the new
generation of conceptual artists personified by her nephew Nathan,
who dreams of the day he can stop ``dicking about with
installations'' and have his own Web site for his tiresome,
opportunistic, and inevitably self-referential projects.
</P>
<P>
   Mackay is a literary artist, and this novel is full of small
masterpieces. The awful Pursey family gathers at an Italian
restaurant: ``It was a warm fleshy evening of Neapolitan love
songs, moist skin and escalopes beaten into the shape of the map of
Italy, the fountain trickling in the grotto behind the bar.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaguely contemplating suicide, Lyris imagines asking the advice
of another great-nephew, a marine biologist who ``would know about
tides and coastal movements and where to find a warm but
treacherous sea where one could avoid officious dolphins who might
insist on snouting one back to shore.''
</P>
<P>
   An obnoxious yuppie couple move in next door to Lyris and make
it plain they're slumming: ``Visible only to themselves and their
friends, a pair of inverted commas hovered above the slate roof . .
. to show that Nancy Carmody and Rod Dyer had set up home there
ironically.''
</P>
<P>
   Mackay economically introduces a large cast of eccentric
characters, some of them benign, a few decidedly not. The low-key
plot unfolds, culminating when Lyris and two friends arrive at a
50th birthday party and are surprised to find the guest of honor, a
woman who works for a hedgehog charity, in tears. ``How can you
stand there and congratulate me?'' she demands. ``Wishing me happy
birthday. . . . Have you no feelings at all?''
</P>
<P>
   They learn that Princess Diana has died. ``Brightness falls from
the air; Queens have died, young and fair,'' says Lyris, moved to
quote Thomas Nashe. But she's soon back in her usual form, bringing
Jackee up short when the young woman's mourning for Diana waxes
maudlin. ``I think we're in danger of genuine grief being whipped
up into something ugly,'' Lyris warns.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Artist's Widow'' Mackay's fans have a treat in store.
Those who have yet to discover her would do well to start with this
novel.

BUDDY GUY JOINS ERIC CLAPTON SALUTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chicago's Buddy Guy once went up to Eric Clapton to express
admiration for the tune ``Strange Brew,'' which Clapton recorded
with the '60s band Cream.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, that song blows my mind,'' Guy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should,'' answered Clapton. ``Those are your licks.''
</P>
<P>
   Guy tells the story with a laugh, but he just got a chance to
give back respect by recording ``Strange Brew'' for a fine new
Clapton tribute disc, ``Blues Power: Songs of Eric Clapton.'' It
also features Clapton tunes covered by Koko Taylor, Bo Diddley,
Otis Rush, Ann Peebles, and Derek Trucks of the Allman Brothers
Band.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric, the Stones, and all those British guys did so much for
us,'' Guy said, referring to fellow Chicago bluesmen Muddy Waters
and Howling Wolf. ``When Eric and Jeff Beck met me in 1965, they
said they had never heard blues played on a Stratocaster before.
And Eric said he slept in a van just to see me play.''
</P>
<P>
   Guy, now 62, had been driving a tow truck in Chicago before he
made that fateful trip to London in 1965. He has remained friends
with Clapton ever since _ and received another career boost when
Clapton invited him to play a series of Royal Albert Hall shows in
1989, which led to Guy being signed with Silvertone Records. The
label later released Guy's Grammy-winning CD, ``Damn Right, I've
Got the Blues,'' and this week issued the compilation, ``Buddy's
Baddest: The Best of Silvertone.'' ``An Innocent Man,'' a song Guy
wrote about Rodney King, a victim of police violence in Los
Angeles, is one of two previously unreleased tracks on the CD.
</P>
<P>
   Guy is backing these latest projects. It's an excellent,
triple-dynamite blues package _ and catches Guy on a high note.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having the time of my life,'' he said in a phone interview
this week from his Legends club in Chicago. ``As long as you can
stay in pretty good health and enjoy what you're doing, what else
is there?''
</P>
<P>
   Guy remains a dynamic performer _ a reputation he carved in the
'60s when he played his guitar behind his back and over his head in
clubs. ``I always said, `I want to sound like B.B. King and act
like Guitar Slim on stage,' '' he noted. ``And I was doing a lot of
things back then that Jimi Hendrix picked up on. Hendrix came up to
me once and said, `I've been watching you. I canceled a gig just to
see you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Many people have watched Guy through the years _ and he's
showing no sign of slowdown.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Truckin' with the Allmans: Derek Trucks, who turned 20 on June
8, has joined the Allman Brothers Band, which hits the Tweeter
Center in Mansfield June 26. Trucks replaces Jack Pearson, an
underrated player who left because of hearing concerns from
tinnitus.
</P>
<P>
   It means a big opportunity for Trucks _ and he's making the most
of it. ``Every time I take a solo, it's a thrill for me,'' he said
this week from Winston-Salem, N.C., where he was listening to a
Howling Wolf CD and relaxing before his fourth show of the Allmans
tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping all the guys get off on a new energy in the band,
because I'm very enthusiastic about being here,'' said Trucks,
whose role is to play a lot of slide guitar and second guitar to
Dickey Betts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love Dickey's playing and, over the years, he's been a great
influence. He's written so many great tunes. You hear one note and
you know it's him. He's amazing. When he steps up to take a solo,
he tries to move mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   Trucks, the nephew of Allmans drummer Butch Trucks, also was
heavily influenced by early Allmans guitarist Duane Allman. ``He's
probably the reason I started playing and started taking the guitar
seriously,'' said Trucks, who at age 8 and 9 used to go to bed
listening to ``Eat a Peach,'' the classic live album on which Duane
shone. ``It's definitely a trip to try to get up and channel some
of that energy,'' Trucks explained.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1992, when he was only 13, Trucks first sat in with the
Allmans. ``I think it was in Jacksonville and it was probably on
(the song) `Statesboro Blues' or `One Way Out.' You know, I'm not
sure!''
</P>
<P>
   Given his family connections, and his immense ability, it was
only natural for Trucks to get called to join. ``They just called
me . . . and said to be at rehearsals on a certain day. There
wasn't any tryout or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Trucks said the Allmans have been playing a lot of early era
songs on this tour, including ``Les Bres in A Minor,'' ``Leave My
Blues at Home,'' and ``Please Call Home.'' Said Trucks: ``We're
still feeling each other out and I'm trying to find a spot where we
can really lock in. But it's feeling good.''
</P>
<P>
   Trucks also plans to continue sprinkling in gigs with his Derek
Trucks Band this summer (and for the rest of the year when the
Allmans are off the road).
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Original Pumpkins: The Smashing Pumpkins are back to their
original lineup with the return of drummer Jimmy Chamberlin. Billy
Corgan, James Iha, D'Arcy, and Chamberlin are currently in a
Chicago studio with producer Flood, who also worked on their
double-CD ``Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness.'' Look for an
October release.

LIMP BIZKIT UNLEASHED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Limp Bizkit's in the house! Limp Bizkit's in the house!''
</P>
<P>
   That's the chant heard on Limp Bizkit's new album, which comes
out Tuesday. But this week, Limp Bizkit's members haven't been in
the house. They've been on the roof. Three rooftops, to be exact _
in Boston, Detroit, and Chicago, where Bizkit fans have flocked
after hearing late-breaking radio announcements for unlicensed,
sneak concerts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is guerrilla style,'' Bizkit singer Fred Durst said this
week. ``This is set up and play until you get shut down.''
</P>
<P>
   It's all part of Bizkit's quest to ``keep it real'' and stay
close to the streets, minus any superstar ego. ``We're just fans
who got lucky and sold some records,'' said Durst. ``We've got to
let people know that we're just like them _ we're just fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston was first up on Sunday, as Bizkit appeared on a
parking-garage roof near Fenway Park, drawing 1,500 folks and
playing 25 minutes until police chased them off. Detroit was next
on Tuesday with Bizkit on a record-store roof; the band was able to
do only two songs before police terminated the experience. Chicago
was next on Wednesday with 6,000 people _ the biggest crowd of the
three-city rooftop series. ``The cops were very cool. They came and
saw how many kids were there and they let us play for 30 minutes,''
said Bizkit manager Peter Katsis, reached on his cell phone after
the gig.
</P>
<P>
   Durst then jumped on the cell phone to discuss the Boston date,
which may lead to fines for the band, though no decision has been
made. ``Without a doubt, the Boston show was the coolest thing I
ever experienced,'' said Durst. ``The other shows this week were
amazing, too, but the first one is always the best.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been pandemonium everywhere, but it's been a lot of
fun,'' added Katsis. (Bizkit will return to play a July 23 date at
the Tsongas Arena in Lowell with Kid Rock and Staind.)
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to nervy rooftop tricks and to momentum from Bizkit's
last album (the 1.5 million-selling ``Three Dollar Bill, Y'all'')
and from bone-crunching sets on the ``Family Values'' tour with
Korn, Ice Cube, Rammstein, and Orgy, Bizkit should make a huge
splash with its new disc, ``Significant Other.'' A VJ on MTV this
week even predicted that it would debut at No. 1 on the charts.
Already, the single ``Nookie'' is blowing up on radio stations
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, it's clear that Bizkit's street-tough brand of heavy
metal/rap is right in sync with listeners who are tired of being
fed corporate hand-me-downs. The music sounds fresh, and the lyrics
are penned by the charismatic Durst, who as a kid in Gastonia,
N.C., loved AC/DC, Kiss, and Ratt, as well as the hip-hop records
he heard at his mostly black high school.
</P>
<P>
   But Durst didn't fit in with either camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was the outcast,'' he recalled. ``I was skateboarding all
around school when nobody was ever skateboarding. . . . Until the
Beastie Boys came out, I was a total reject.''
</P>
<P>
   Durst went into the Navy, then opened a skate park in Charlotte,
N.C., then became a tattoo designer _ and first met Korn while
giving the band members tattoos. He moved to Jacksonville, Fla.,
where he formed Bizkit with Wes Borland (guitars), Sam Rivers
(bass), John Otto (drums), and DJ Lethal (turntables and samples).
And the rest has been a fast-moving time bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Durst's residual anger coated Bizkit's debut disc, ``Three
Dollar Bill, Y'all.'' It was a milestone in male rage. ``I just
exploded and you couldn't understand a lot of the words,'' he
admitted.
</P>
<P>
   He also exploded onstage, where Bizkit has truly left its mark
with incendiary performances that ignite mosh pits and devastate
any eardrums that dare get in the way. Imagine John Lennon's primal
screams turned up as high as they'll go, topped by some unearthly
raving.
</P>
<P>
   But although he's a high-wire act onstage, like Iggy Pop, Durst
comes across as mellow offstage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's a release for me, for sure,'' Durst said of
performing. ``It's something to see people with a vibe and glow in
their eyes. Everybody is there for different reasons and that
creates one gigantic ball of energy that hits you in different
ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certain people are singing certain lyrics, and some girls are
screaming, and some other people are crying and feeling other
stuff,'' he added. ``It's so many different emotions. It's the most
powerful thing in the world. I've never experienced anything like
that. It's like an adrenaline rush takes over.''
</P>
<P>
   Durst enjoys the attention, but he's not a macho-style star who
neurotically craves it. In fact, Bizkit's new album has a song,
``No Sex,'' which decries the macho lust of many male rock stars.
In graphic terms, Durst sings, ``I feel disgusted and you should,
too . . . Should have left my pants on, but instead you let me dive
right in.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a message I hope people will get,'' said Durst. ``There's
so much meaninglessness out there, so much emptiness . . . Sex is
something that when rushed into can ruin things.''
</P>
<P>
   Sex is also at the heart of the new single ``Nookie,'' about a
former girlfriend he loved and supported, only to find that she was
cheating on him with his friends. The result is an angry
declaration in which Durst finally tells the woman to get lost.
</P>
<P>
   Durst also believes in God _ and believes that God gives him his
lyrics. And, typical of Durst's need to feel a bond with his fans,
he keeps the lyrics on a simple enough plane so that everyone can
understand them _ when he's not shouting himself hoarse, that is.
``I don't want to be eclectic and poetic,'' he said. ``I don't want
to be really artsy, because a lot of people just don't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Limp Bizkit has an ability to blister listeners with a
high-volume assault, but also a unique ability to uplift those
listeners, as with the band's hit cover of George Michael's
``Faith'' last year. They pumped up the volume but retained the
song's upbeat message.
</P>
<P>
   The new album, ``Significant Other,'' finds Bizkit offering a
more ``accepting'' view of life, Durst said. ``This record is about
accepting a lot of the pain that you might go through in everyday
relationships, emotions, and friends.'' A case in point is the
moodily psychedelic song ``A Lesson Learned.''
</P>
<P>
   Anger still lurks beneath the surface, but fully explodes on
only one song: ``Break Stuff.'' It's about ``one of those days when
you just don't want to wake up . . . you don't know why, but you
want to justify ripping someone's head off.
</P>
<P>
   ``That song is probably the exception, but every other song
explains what happened to me, then the turnaround of the song is
about accepting it,'' said Durst. ``Or at least understanding it.
And I'd never even thought about trying to understand it in the
past.''

SAMMY SOSA, DIPLOMAT, ON THE WAY TO GREATNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service cliens.)  
 By RAY RATTO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Sammy Sosa's gift for diplomacy borders, well,
on the frightening.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, for example, he performed the heretofore unattempted
``I Like It Here AND There'' double Salchow from the visitors
dugout at Candlestick Park. To nobody's surprise, he executed it
flawlessly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like hitting in this ballpark, I'll miss playing here,'' the
second coming of Mr. Cub said before the Giants' 3-2 victory over
Chicago. ``But I like playing in a new ballpark. Everyone likes to
play where there's a lot of enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   Not only did he perform this acrobatic feat on a cold evening
when most athletes would have trouble with muscle pulls, he did it
without any visible strain or exertion, as though it were the
easiest thing in the world to find reasons to like both this joint
and one he hasn't even been in yet.
</P>
<P>
   By now, though, this sort of thing is expected of Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   Having set the standard for grace in the face of extraordinary
success a year ago, he is diligent about letting nobody down the
year after. If he wants to like Candlestick AND its successor at
the same time, frankly, he's earned it.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, at a time in baseball history when more players are
hitting more home runs than ever before, Sosa seems more and more
like the one who will get the most inner mileage out of it.
</P>
<P>
   He almost surely will become the spokesman for the new power
generation, a group that is larger and more cumbersome than it has
ever been, and includes more players you never thought of in that
capacity.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-three men hit 30 or more homers last year, a remarkable
figure that is sure to be exceeded this season, even allowing for
those members of the Usual Suspects club who are not currently on a
pace to do so, like Albert Belle, Alex Rodriguez, Tony Clark, Jim
Thome, Frank Thomas, Nomar Garciaparra, Barry Bods, Jeff Kent, Ray
Lankford, Vinny Castilla, Henry Rodriguez and Javy Lopez.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, home runs have never been cheaper to obtain than
they are now, for a variety of reasons too numerous to repeat here
for the 350th time. And while it is true that Mark McGwire will
always be the figure against whom all other big-time bombers will
be matched, Sammy Sosa will be the spokesman who explains it all to
the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   That he can manage this while cementing his own place as one of
the dominant figures of the decade is more remarkable than perhaps
it should be. He often says that neither he nor McGwire could have
destroyed Roger Maris' record without the other, but he is also a
leader in the late '90s phalanx of power hitters who have changed
the parameters within which the game is played.
</P>
<P>
   Dusty Baker, Giant manager and part-time baseball historian, was
asked before the game if he thought Sosa was on the verge of
achieving the kind of stature that Frank Robinson, Henry Aaron and
Roberto Clemente did in the '60s. Baker, not surprisingly,
acknowledged that Sosa was almost, but not quite, there.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's getting close,'' Baker said in admiration. ``He's
definitely getting in that echelon. But it took those guys 10, 15
years. You don't get in that echelon overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   One can argue, though, that Robinson, Aaron and Clemente got to
be Robinson, Aaron and Clemente in a lot fewer than 10 years, in
which case Sosa is already there. He would have six consecutive
years of 30 or more homers if his figure in the strike-shortened
1994 season were pro-rated, and his newfound selectivity at the
plate has now made him a consistent .300 hitter. Plus, he is only
30, which allows him plenty of time to convince Baker beyond all
shadow of doubt.
</P>
<P>
   It is, however, Sosa's ability to see the half-filled glass and
know that the waiter is on his way to fill it to the top any second
now that will separate him from the dozens of other sluggers of his
generation. Those who remember 1998 (``I try not to remember it,''
Sosa says with a smile) will remember the way Sosa not only helped
raise the bar mathematically, but emotionally as well. He made the
world safe for fun through achievement, and for the most cheerful
kind of diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   He says he likes Candlestick Park, after all, and if he weren't
Sammy Sosa, you'd be sure he was lying through his teeth.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; By DAVID GREENBERG &QL; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Alabama Senate voted to repeal the state's
constitutional prohibition against interracial marriage, 32 years
after the Supreme Court struck down Virginia's similar ban.
</P>
<P>
   Hadn't these archaic laws gone out with Bull Connor? I asked
myself as I read the news account. And haven't we been hearing that
America has rediscovered the melting pot, that in another
generation or two we'll all be ``cablinasian,'' like Tiger Woods?
</P>
<P>
   I talked to the measure's main sponsor, state Rep. Alvin Holmes,
a 24-year statehouse veteran who has been trying to overturn the
ban for decades.``The last time I tried was about three years
ago,'' said Holmes. ``It didn't get out of committee.'' Holmes
credits his success to the last election, in which a bevy of
Democrats were swept into office.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes wasn't just tidying up the legal code. In parts of rural
Alabama, he said, probate judges still refuse to issue marriage
licenses to interracial couples. Holmes explained that some of his
Alabama colleagues opposed his measure because they willfully
refused to accept that the federal government had the power to
override state law--an ideology of states' rights that goes way
beyond Newt Gingrich to John Calhoun.
</P>
<P>
   When you think about it, it makes sense that some Alabamians
found it hard to jettison overnight a 300-year-old custom. Laws
against interracial marriage--and the taboos against black-white
sex that they codify--have been the central weapon in the
oppression of African-Americans since the dawn of slavery.
President Abraham Lincoln's detractors charged him in the 1864
presidential campaign with promoting the mongrelization of the
races (that's where the coinage ``miscegenation,'' which now sounds
racist, comes from).
</P>
<P>
   Enemies of the 20th-century civil rights movement predicted that
the repeal of Jim Crow laws would, as one Alabama state senator put
it, ``open the bedroom doors of our white women to black men.''
Fears of black sexuality have been responsible for some of the most
notorious incidents of anti-black violence and persecution, from
the Scottsboro Boys to Emmett Till.
</P>
<P>
   Intermarriage bans arose in the late 1600s, when tobacco
planters in Virginia needed to shore up their new institution of
slavery. In previous decades, before slavery took hold, interracial
sex was more prevalent than at any other time in American history.
White and black laborers lived and worked side by side and
naturally became intimate. Even interracial marriage, though
uncommon, was allowed.
</P>
<P>
   But as race slavery replaced servitude as the South's labor
force, interracial sex threatened to blur the distinctions between
white and black--and thus between free and slave. Virginia began
categorizing a child as free or slave according to the mother's
status (which was easier to determine than the father's), and so in
1691 the assembly passed a law to make sure that women didn't bear
mixed-race children.
</P>
<P>
   The law banned ``negroes, mulatto's and Indians intermarrying
with English, or other white women, [and their unlawfull [sic
accompanying with one another.'' Since the society was heavily
male, the prohibition on unions between white women and nonwhite
men also lessened the white men's competition for mates. (In
contrast, sex between male slave owners and their female
slaves--which often meant rape--was common. It typically met with
light punishment, if any at all.)
</P>
<P>
   If fears of interracial sex underlay bans on interracial
marriage, it was marriage that became the greater threat. Men might
rape black women or keep them as concubines, but to marry them
would confer legal equality. Thus, over the course of the 18th
century all Southern states--and many Northern ones--outlawed all
marriages between blacks and whites. Up through the Civil War, only
two states, Pennsylvania in 1780 and Massachusetts in 1843--hotbeds
of abolitionist activity--repealed their bans.
</P>
<P>
   The end of slavery should have made things better. It didn't.
</P>
<P>
   In the South, the federal government initially forced the
removal of the bans in several states. But when federal troops
pulled out, the bans returned, along with a whole complex of new
discriminatory laws known as Jim Crow. In the West, 13 states
passed new laws against interracial marriage, many of them
targeting white-Asian unions along with white-black ones. Only in
the North did laws against intermarriage draw real fire, coming off
the books in Maine, Michigan, Ohio, and Rhode Island.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even in the most enlightened areas, mixed-race couples
faced enormous social stigma. Clerks refused to issue marriage
licenses to mixed couples, and ministers often wouldn't marry them.
Couples that did marry faced harassment from employers and
neighbors. In 1944, Gunnar Myrdal, in An American Dilemma, noted
that ``even a liberal-minded Northerner of cosmopolitan culture
will, in nine cases out of ten, express a definite feeling
against'' interracial marriage. It was, he said, a ``consecrated
taboo'' that ``fixed'' the boundary between the races.
</P>
<P>
   That changed slowly with the civil right movement, which
reshaped the nation's consciousness. In 1967, an interracial
married couple named Richard and Mildred Loving brought to the
Supreme Court a suit against Virginia, claiming the right to live
there. The court sided with them unanimously, decreeing the ban
unconstitutional under the 14th Amendment. The fortuitously named
Loving decision took its place in law books, but not necessarily in
practice. Where no one had the wherewithal to stand up for it--say,
in rural Alabama--Loving was flouted.
</P>
<P>
   Precisely as white racists feared, desegregation encouraged
interracial unions. Blacks and whites began to meet and date,
especially on college campuses, which started admitting
African-Americans in larger numbers in the '60s and '70s. The next
generation saw a surge in intermarriage.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, 0.7 percent of blacks married someone of another race.
By 1994, the figure had reached 12.1 percent. The 1960 census
recorded 51,000 black-white marriages. Today there are more than
300,000. Attitudes changed too. In 1958, 4 percent of white
Americans approved of interracial marriages. In 1994, it was 45
percent. And younger generations are vastly more tolerant than
their elders, suggesting these numbers will climb.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's hard not to also see the glass as half--or, more
precisely, 55 percent--empty. All these numbers may be climbing,
but they remain low. What's more, the white-black marriage rate
lags significantly behind rates of white intermarriage with other,
nonblack races. Among 25- to 34-year-olds, 52 percent of Native
Americans and 40 percent of Asians married outside their race,
while only 6 percent of blacks did so. The racism that kept
Alabama's constitution unchanged has hardly been eradicated.
</P>
<P>
   Whether these habits will change on their own, with the
maturation of a more tolerant generation, or whether full social
acceptance of black Americans will require a concerted governmental
effort, is unknowable. In the meantime, we can take only meager
pride in achieving a society in which interracial marriage is safe,
legal and, alas, rare.

PEBBLE BEACH SOLD TO ARNOLD PALMER, CLINT EASTWOOD AND OTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PETER HARTLAUB  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A celebrity-studded group that includes Peter
Ueberroth, Arnold Palmer and Clint Eastwood grabbed one of the most
coveted chunks of real estate in California, agreeing to buy Pebble
Beach golf course for $820 million.
</P>
<P>
   Ueberroth called the course the best in the world, and pledged
to keep it that way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a transparent change from one owner to the other,''
Ueberroth said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Ueberroth, the former baseball commissioner, put together the
group _ golf legend Palmer, actor Eastwood, former United Airlines
CEO Richard Ferris and General Electric Pensions _ that succeeded
in purchasing the Pebble Beach Co. and its impressive list of
property holdings from current owner, The Lone Cypress Co.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement ends several months of negotiations between the
two groups over the sale of Pebble Beach, the legendary birthplace
of the Bing Crosby Pro-Am Golf Tournament _ the ``Crosby
Clambake,'' as some called it.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the deal will close on July 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel it is a fair price,'' Ferris said. ``It is a good
investment or we wouldn't be investing.''
</P>
<P>
   The new ownership group brings together four men who have
climbed to the pinnacles of success in four vastly different
professions. All four love golf, especially the challenge of
playing Pebble Beach. Ueberroth, Ferris and Eastwood all have long
ties to Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer is possibly the most famous golfer of the last half of
this century. At 69, he is winding down his memorable career on the
PGA Senior Tour. Palmer has for many years been involved with his
Arnold Palmer Co., which has managed the Presidio Golf Club in San
Francisco since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood, whose acting or directing credits include such
classics as ``Dirty Harry'' and ``High Plains Drifter,'' said the
group is ``sensitive to the values'' of the Monterey peninsula and
the surrounding environment.
</P>
<P>
   The 68-year-old Eastwood, formerly the mayor of nearby Carmel
and still a resident of that town, is a longtime golfer who plays
every year in the AT&AMP;T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am.
</P>
<P>
   Ueberroth, 61, who was baseball commissioner from 1984-89 and
president of the Los Angeles Olympic Organizing Committee in 1984,
also is a regular in the AT&AMP;T Pro- Am and a member of the
tournament's board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very special place; people come from all over the world
to play here,'' Ueberroth said.
</P>
<P>
   Pebble Beach officials said the deal would not have succeeded if
the new group didn't have close ties to the community. All of the
new principal owners have played the course in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   The deal includes four golf courses _ the Pebble Beach Golf
Links, Spyglass Hill Golf Course, The Links at Spanish Bay and Del
Monte Golf Course _ and two resorts, The Lodge at Pebble Beach and
The Inn at Spanish Bay along with tourist-friendly 17-Mile Drive
that winds through Pebble Beach and nearby Del Monte Forest. In
addition, the new owners take over several hundred acres of
undeveloped land, where they plan to build another golf course and
more than 300 homes.
</P>
<P>
   The Pebble Beach area has long been a tourist attraction. In
1919 it was developed when the grandnephew and namesake of
telegraph inventor Samuel Morse, Samuel F.B. Morse, purchased the
Del Monte Forest on the Monterey peninsula for a then-whopping $1.4
million.
</P>
<P>
   Ueberroth's group becomes the fourth owner of the Pebble Beach
Co. this decade. Bank of America is providing financing. Ueberroth
said the price was ``exactly $820 million'' _ less than the same
property sold for nine years ago. The price tag means it is one of
the few pieces of real estate that has not skyrocketed in value
this decade.

WOMEN GOLFERS GEAR UP FOR WORLD CUP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DWIGHT CHAPIN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The favorites are the United States, China, Norway and Germany,
but don't be surprised if the Women's World Cup, which begins a
three-week run Saturday with doubleheaders in East Rutherford,
N.J., and San Jose, turns wild and woolly.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence of that, you need look no further back than last
weekend, when 500-1 tournament longshot Nigeria knocked off China,
4-3, in a tuneup match in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Now you can say the match didn't mean anything. But Chinese
coach Ma Yuanan, questioned about the defeat earlier this week, was
scurrying to find excuses.
</P>
<P>
   Although saying, ``I think the Nigerian team is very good and
will play very good in this competition,'' Ma noted that the
playing field ``was not very good,'' that the goals were two
different sizes, that a couple of his players were feeling the
effects of jet lag and one key performer was injured.
</P>
<P>
   All of which leads to the conclusion that the loss was at least
unsettling to a quick and tenacious Chinese team that has been seen
as a tournament co-favorite, with the United States, after beating
the Americans twice in three matches this year.
</P>
<P>
   And the China-Nigeria result just may portend what's ahead in
the 16-team Women's World Cup, which with 475,000 tickets already
sold will be the biggest women-only sports event ever.
</P>
<P>
   The action on the West Coast starts Saturday at Spartan Stadium,
with Sweden against China, followed by Canada facing Japan. A
quarterfinal double-header is set at Spartan Stadium on July 30,
with a semifinal at Stanford Stadium on July 4. The tournament will
conclude July 10 with the final at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe there is one favorite in the World Cup,'' said
coach Wilson De Olivera Rica of Brazil, which is in the second tier
of contenders along with Denmark, Sweden, Canada, Brazil, and _ off
the China upset _ perhaps Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is seen by so many countries as the top
nation, primarily because they train together year-round and play
so many games together. They certainly will be the team to shoot
for. But there is a host of nations who, when they put 11 players
on the field, can compete with the U.S. or anyone else. Including
Brazil.''
</P>
<P>
   The two top finishers in each of four groups will advance to the
quarterfinals. And, as a bonus, at least seven of the eight
quarterfinalists automatically qualify for the Sydney Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   (Australia, as host of the Games, is guaranteed a spot in 2000).
</P>
<P>
   This is the third Women's World Cup. The United States took the
first one, in 1991, with Norway winning the second, in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Those two countries have had an ongoing rivalry for years. The
Americans defeated the Norwegians for the '91 championship, but
Norway returned the favor in the '95 semifinals. In the 1996
Olympics, the United States downed Norway in the semifinals. But
Norway came back to hand the American women their worst loss ever _
4-1 _ in a tournament in Portugal last year.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the tournament will be the biggest showcase ever for
the U.S. team, which opens play Saturday at Giants Stadium against
Denmark, followed by a Brazil-Mexico match.
</P>
<P>
   Tony DiCicco, who has coached the U.S. squad since 1994,
believes his veteran-laden team is ready to play _ and play well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel pretty good,'' DiCicco said. ``There's a great
mentality on this team. It's a very close team, as close as any
I've ever been associated with as a coach. We've been training a
long time. Now it's time to test what we've done on the playing
field.''

HEARST ANNOUNCES NEW VERSION OF COSMOPOLITAN FOR TEENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hearst Magazines, publisher of 37 international
editions of Cosmopolitan, the world's best-selling title for young
women, announced Friday that the company will introduce a new teen
title under the Cosmopolitan name.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine, titled CosmoGIRL!, and its related Web site
(www.cosmogirl.com), are geared for girls ages 12-17 and will debut
on June 29.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst Magazines will test three issues during 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teenagers in the United States either spent, or encouraged
their parents to spend nearly $125 billion last year,'' said
Cathleen P. Black, president of Hearst Magazines. ``This is a
growing market, and the time is right for us to introduce this
title.''
</P>
<P>
   Atoosa Rubenstein, 27, project editor of the new magazine and
former senior fashion editor at Cosmopolitan, said the
publication's message is that ``through advice, inspiration, and
scoop... our reader can be all that she desires to be. This is what
distinguishes CosmoGIRL! from other teenage titles.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubenstein said she wants CosmoGIRL! to be the teenage girl's
best friend _ the one whose going to help her get through junior
high school and high school. She's the one girls go to when no one
else understands... the one who inspires her to `Go Girl!'''
</P>
<P>
   The new magazine also will have its own Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our initial response is very encouraging and we believe
CosmoGIRL! will be a hit with readers and advertisers alike,'' said
Donna Kalajian Lagani, senior vice president and publisher of
Cosmopolitan.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Barnard College in 1993, Rubenstein began
working at Cosmopolitan as a fashion assistant under Helen Gurley
Brown, the creator of Cosmopolitan.
</P>
<P>
   She also worked at Sassy magazine in the beauty and fashion
departments and at American Health magazine (Reader's Digest
Corporation) throughout her college years.
</P>
<P>
   CosmoGIRL! will have a newsstand distribution of 850,000 and a
cover price of $2.99.

   ATLANTA: Baptists in the South.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Land, head of the Southern Baptist Convention's Ethics
and Religious Liberty Commission, agrees. If conservatives had not
won, he said, there would have been a ``significant hemorrhaging''
of conservatives from the Southern Baptist Convention and it might
now be dealing with issues that trouble mainline Protestant groups
such as the United Methodist Church, Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)
and Episcopal Church. ``Our convention might now be debating
whether to ordain homosexuals to the ministry, and our convention
might be debating whether to bless same-sex unions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship does resemble
so-called mainline Protestantism. Whereas the platform of the
Southern Baptist Convention is filled with male clergy, four of
eight moderators of the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship have been
women, and several, including the current moderator, are laity. And
the Fellowship is much more inclined than the SBC to participate in
ecumenical efforts with Methodists, Presbyterians and
Episcopalians.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the Southern Baptist Convention often joins hands with
the country's evangelicals, aligning with leaders such as James
Dobson and Chuck Colson.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at Washington and what's going on legislatively,
you see a lot of cooperation between Southern Baptists and
evangelicals,'' said Timothy Morgan, an editor for Christianity
Today magazine, founded by evangelist Billy Graham to cover the
evangelical movement.
</P>
<P>
   But the Fellowship has not affiliated with the National Council
of Churches, the meeting ground for the country's historic
Protestant bodies. And the Southern Baptist Convention is not an
official member of the National Association of Evangelicals, a
network of conservative denominations and ministries.
</P>
<P>
   Looking ahead
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of both the Southern Baptist Convention and the
Cooperative Baptist Fellowship predict bright futures.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am firmly convinced that we have been tested and found true
to God's word, and he is going to use us to lead a great revival in
the United States,'' said Land of the SBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're healthy and we're growing,'' said Vestal, who directs
the Fellowship. ``And we're young and still emerging to shape our
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is confident that both or either will prosper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be concerned about the future of both groups,'' said
Greg Warner, editor of Associated Baptist Press, a Baptist news
service developed as an alternative to the official denominational
news agency. Warner, a graduate of Southwestern Baptist Theological
Seminary, has been covering Southern Baptists since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Warner sees the Southern Baptist Convention ``drawing the circle
smaller and smaller and drawing itself in opposition to culture and
to the rest of Christendom, whether or not that's intentional. ...
The whole tone and mode create a negative impression.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Fellowship's mission is clearly ``geared for a
future faith,'' Warner said, ``they haven't lived out their mission
statement yet.'' Although many sociologists of religion believe the
traditional denominational model of Christianity is outmoded, the
Fellowship, he said, ``is still populated by Baptists who function
primarily in the denominational mode. They're still thinking
institutionally and in some ways trying to create a new
denominational structure.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of both groups acknowledge they will not prosper with
business as usual.
</P>
<P>
   At the Southern Baptist Convention this week in Atlanta,
Patterson used his presidential platform to push evangelism,
ministry and missions in the nation's cities. The denomination that
grew out of the agrarian South is now largely suburban. But
Patterson told his fellow Baptists that many of the nation's
problems are in its cities, and they should be playing a
constructive role in solving them.
</P>
<P>
   And Vestal says the Fellowship will begin strategic planning
with its annual assembly in Birmingham next week. The Fellowship,
he said, ``sees itself primarily as a network that has multiple
partners'' and functions with ``more freedom, more flexibility and
much more diversity than denominations with firm hierarchies and
huge bureaucracies.''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few thousand of the country's Southern Baptists will
attend either the Fellowship or the SBC meeting this year. Most
remain in their churches and communities, far from national
policy-making or politics.
</P>
<P>
   At the state and local level, Baptist leaders are still
attempting to hold together the two sides to toil together in the
fields of the Lord. ``The way to avoid splits is to recognize that
diversity exists and, where it is possible, to be gracious and
extend opportunities for service to those who disagree,'' said the
Rev. Robert White, executive director of the Georgia Baptist
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, the ties appear to continue to bind, albeit to
various degrees. Membership and giving in the state's Southern
Baptist churches are at record numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In spite of the controversy, God's work continues to be
done,'' said White, ``which, I think, says a lot about the power of
God and his message.''

 &HT;    Two decades ago, conservatives captured the leadership of the
Southern Baptist Convention; now they're firmly in control
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Rev. Jerry Falwell looked right at home on the
podium of the Georgia Dome, facing the Southern Baptists sitting in
the blue-green seats of the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Paige Patterson, convention president, welcomed him as
a brother and a ``new Southern Baptist.'' Then Falwell prayed,
thanking God for ``this invincible church,'' for Patterson, and for
all the agency heads and seminary leaders of the Southern Baptist
Convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 20 brief years,'' he reminded God, ``men of God in every
position! We thank you for them.''
</P>
<P>
   The reference was obviously directed at the 1979 Southern
Baptist Convention, when the conservative resurgence _ known by
opponents as the fundamentalist takeover _ surfaced. It began with
the election of the Rev. Adrian Rogers of Memphis as president of
the convention, and has continued, gaining steam, every year
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   But even without Falwell's spoken reminder, his presence on the
platform beside Patterson as president was ample evidence of how
much the country's largest Protestant denomination has changed.
</P>
<P>
   Before that historic Houston meeting, Patterson was an outsider
to convention leadership, but from his distant outpost, he was
plotting a strategy that would radically alter the course of the
convention. Falwell was an independent Baptist, well to the right
of Southern Baptist leaders. His Thomas Road Baptist Church in
Lynchburg, Va., now contributes to Southern Baptist Conservatives
of Virginia, a new state convention formed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As Falwell suggested in his prayer, the extent of conservative
change reaches far beyond the convention platform, extending up and
down the ladder of leadership, from directors of mission agencies
to reporters for the denominational news service.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the so-called moderates, whose decline in
denominational influence began with Rogers' election, retreated and
regrouped after 12 consecutive years of being on the losing side of
the political bloodshed. In 1991, 6,000 of them held their own
rally in Atlanta with rousing speeches that compared their group _
the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship _ to great liberation movements
from the Israelites to civil rights.
</P>
<P>
   The two Baptist entities are neither separate nor equal.
</P>
<P>
   Although many congregations contribute to both, not daring to
risk a church split by taking a straight up-or-down vote on either,
the two groups differ drastically in size, shape and the company
they keep.
</P>
<P>
   The SBC today claims 15.7 million members _ more than before
some moderates began to drift away. That number declined in 1998
for the first time since 1926, according to official records. But
those figures include a large number of ``nonresident'' members who
have moved away or whose whereabouts are unknown. The convention's
resident membership is 10.7 million _ and actually peaked at 11
million in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The SBC claims 40,870 churches and adopted a 2000 denominational
budget of $159.6 million for its institutions and missions.
</P>
<P>
   The Cooperative Baptist Fellowship, based in Atlanta, gets
support from 1,790 churches, has an annual budget of $14.5 million,
sends out its own missionary force, and is associated with 11
theological educational programs, including two in Atlanta, at
Mercer and Emory universities.
</P>
<P>
   While speakers to the Southern Baptist Convention have included
Falwell, then-President George Bush and then-Vice President Dan
Quayle, the most famous person to address the Cooperative Baptist
Fellowship is former President Jimmy Carter, who declared himself
to be one of their number.
</P>
<P>
   Coffee and concern
</P>
<P>
   It all began over beignets in 1967 when Patterson, a student at
New Orleans Baptist Theological Seminary, met Judge Paul Pressler,
a justice on the Texas Court of Appeals. Both were worried about
what they saw as the liberal leanings of Baptistdom, especially in
the classrooms of the denomination's seminaries.
</P>
<P>
   Over coffee at Cafe du Monde, the two shared their concerns.
``Basically the conservative movement was born right there,''
Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   The two determined that if they could get enough people to the
annual Southern Baptist Convention, conservatives could win the
presidency. And the president could appoint committees that would
eventually turn around the entire denomination.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade of planting and nourishing, they were ready to
harvest in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   In the ensuing years, both the intensity of convention politics
and attendance at annual meetings skyrocketed. Only 12,000 souls
had voted in that 1979 election, but by the late 1980s,
``messengers'' _ official attendees _ numbered more than 40,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Daniel Vestal of Dunwoody was nominated for president
of the convention in 1990. With 37,856 people voting, he lost to
the Rev. Morris Chapman, a Wichita Falls, Texas, pastor.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``A Messenger's Memoirs: Sixty-one Southern Baptist
Convention Meetings,'' Robert Naylor, president emeritus of
Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth, Texas,
wrote of the meeting, held in New Orleans, ``There was a difference
about this convention. It could have been the gathering of the
Republicans and the Democrats. The controversy that had plagued
this convention for a dozen years seemed to be reaching its apex.''
</P>
<P>
   With Vestal's defeat, the moderates defected in spirit if not in
membership. In 1991, convention attendance was less than half that
of the previous year, and Chapman was re-elected without
opposition. A corner had been turned.
</P>
<P>
   At this year's convention, Pressler promoted his new book, ``A
Hill on Which to Die,'' which details ``how conservatives wrested
control from the moderates'' (Broadman &AMP; Holman, $29.99). It was a
sellout at the convention bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   Mainline or evangelical?
</P>
<P>
   The doctrinal party that became known as conservatives or
fundamentalists had built its platform on the ``inerrancy'' of
Scripture, the claim that the Bible is literally true. The party
that became known as the moderates focused on the priesthood of all
believers, or the right of all Christians to interpret Scripture
for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Mohler, president of the Southern Baptist Theological
Seminary in Louisville, casts the battle as a struggle over whether
the Southern Baptist Convention would become a mainline Protestant
denomination or an evangelical group. Mohler, one of the young
leaders of the conservative movement, clearly prefers the
evangelical side.
</P>
<P>
   Many other Protestant groups underwent fundamentalist-modernist
struggles in the 1920s, and in those cases, the modernists won,
Mohler says. The evangelical movement was founded largely by
conservatives who pulled out of those groups.
</P>
<P>
   The difference in the Southern Baptist Convention half a century
later is that the conservatives won. Now, Mohler says, ``there is
an evangelical denomination of Baptists in the South and a mainline
Protestant denomination of Baptists in the South.''

FUGITIVE IN 1975 CALIFORNIA TERRORISM CASE APPEARS IN COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LARRY D. HATFIELD  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL, Minn. _ After more than two decades of hiding in plain
sight, the woman alleged to be Kathleen Ann Soliah, alias Sarah
Jane Olson, found herself standing before the world in a bright
orange prisoner's jumpsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Her backers proclaimed that the church-going, casserole-baking,
play-acting soccer mom they had known as Olson for two decades
could not possibly be Soliah, the bomb-laying, rich-hating
terrorist and fugitive that the FBI and Los Angeles Police
Department said she was.
</P>
<P>
   ``No evidence was introduced in court (today) indicating Ms.
Olson is in fact Kathleen Soliah,'' her attorney, Howard Bass, said
Thursday, hours after she appeared in Ramsey County (Minn.)
District Court.
</P>
<P>
   Her appearance was to answer charges that she was, indeed, the
former associate of the terrorist Symbionese Liberation Army who
planted bombs under police squad cars in Los Angeles in 1975 in
order to kill cops.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult for everyone who knows Sarah Olson to believe
that she could be Kathleen Soliah,'' Bass said. ``Ms. Olson is
described by those who know her as a pacifist who is involved in
numerous peace and justice issues, a liberal Democrat, a gun
control advocate and a perfect neighbor.''
</P>
<P>
   With two dozen church women from her neighborhood Methodist
church cheering her on, Olson/Soliah was further extolled by Bass
for assisting the blind and ghetto kids and feeding the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   ``By all accounts, Ms. Olson is the typical soccer mom _ not the
revolutionary terrorist Kathleen Soliah is alleged to have been a
quarter-century ago,'' Bass said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI scoffed at claims that Olson was not Soliah. FBI
spokeswoman Coleen Rowley said a fingerprint analysis removed any
doubt.
</P>
<P>
   In the front row of the small, crowded courtroom, her Olson's
daughters _ Emily, 18, Sophia, 17, and Layla, 12 _ wept. Her
husband, emergency room physician Gerald F. Peterson, remained
stoic.
</P>
<P>
   His 51-year-old wife, who alternately looked somber and smirked
as she stood in the dock, is accused in Los Angeles of attempted
murder and other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The government charges Soliah was part of the terrorist SLA, or
its offshoot, the New World Liberation Front. The SLA, a ragtag
collection of ex-convicts and young student radicals, assassinated
Oakland Schools Supt. Marcus Foster, kidnapped newspaper heiress
Patricia Hearst and committed bank robberies in its brief, violent
existence in the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Soliah, according to official and other sources, joined the NWLF
after six SLA ``soldiers'' perished in a shootout with Los Angeles
cops in Compton in May 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst, who had converted to the terrorist group, and surviving
members Bill and Emily Harris, were captured in their San Francisco
hideouts the next year.
</P>
<P>
   Soliah, who went underground when Hearst and the Harrises were
arrested, was seized by FBI and local police Wednesday near her
vine-covered home in an upscale St. Paul neighborhood. She was on
her way to teach a class in English as a second language, which she
did regularly, neighbors said.
</P>
<P>
   Susan B. Jordan, an Oakland lawyer hired to represent her, did
not concede that Soliah and Olson were the same person, but said in
a statement that charges filed in 1976 might have been politically
motivated and without basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are allegations which arose at a time in our history of
intense scrutiny of all political activists,'' Jordan said. At the
time, ``overreaction on the part of law enforcement . . . was not
unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   California Gov. Gray Davis is expected to file an extradition
request soon and Minnesota's Gov. Jesse Ventura is expected to
approve it.
</P>
<P>
   Soliah refused in court to waive extradition proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   During the brief hearing, District Judge Kathleen Gearin ordered
that Soliah be held without bail pending resolution of whether the
alleged crimes in California were bailable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   She continued the case until July 15, although action on Davis'
expected extradition request could come sooner.
</P>
<P>
   The potential sentence is life imprisonment with possibility of
parole, but legal experts say faded memories of witnesses and the
easing of any public outrage could lead to a plea bargain.

U.S. DEPLOYS NEW EYES ALONG BORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ The U.S. government is installing cameras at
border points in Texas to track fugitives and stolen cars by
scanning the license plates of all vehicles entering or leaving the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The cameras, which are being set up from Brownsville to El Paso,
will automatically scan the front and rear license plates and feed
the information into a national law enforcement database in
Newington, Va.
</P>
<P>
   The cameras, which cost approximately $60,000 each, could boost
the ability of the U.S. Customs Service and Immigration and
Naturalization Service to track when and where travelers have
entered or left the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it will better give us an opportunity to identify
people coming through who are not doing the right thing,'' Joe
O'Gorman, chief of land border passenger processing for Customs,
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The cameras are mounted on six-foot poles and can read license
plates of cars traveling as fast as 50 mph, according to Customs.
</P>
<P>
   Images of the license plate numbers would be digitalized and
bounced to the Virginia database where they would be checked
against information on suspected fugitives, smugglers and other
criminals, as well as stolen vehicles, O'Gorman said.
</P>
<P>
   At present, border guards in Texas manually punch into computers
the license plate numbers of people entering the country, but no
information is gathered on traffic headed south, O'Gorman said.
</P>
<P>
   The cameras could speed up border crossings, but that is not the
principal purpose of the equipment, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Border guards are already using the cameras in Southern
California and the devices are expected to be operational as soon
as next week in El Paso, O'Gorman said.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the year, officials expect the cameras to be
operational at nearly all of the U.S.-Mexico border ports of entry.
</P>
<P>
   The Border Patrol, which is part of the INS, already has cameras
and sensors installed along the Rio Grande that detect footsteps
and vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   There is not universal acceptance of the technology.
</P>
<P>
   In Laredo, City Councilman Louis Bruni said he supports efforts
to improve security, but is concerned about the increasing law
enforcement presence along the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I fear is that we are turning into a police state _
it is extremely scary,'' Bruni said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see why the federal government wants these things for
national security, but it is frightening we have arrived at this
point,'' Bruni said.

IS IT GRAMPS OR A 14-YEAR-OLD?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I'm a 77-year-old computer neophyte. (My kids
gave me this PC to drive me out of my mind. I keep a 2-pound sledge
beside me, and one day _ kapow! _ out of my misery!!) I've started
getting a screen from the ``content adviser'' on America Online
blocking Web sites because the sites were not rated and a
supervisor's password was needed. I've talked to AOL three times.
</P>
<P>
   _ Access Denied
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DENIED: You know, you'd think AOL would have known the
answer since it is its program that's giving you fits. Or maybe AOL
thinks you really enjoy listening to Muzak while you're on infinity
hold.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, it sounds as though you're running up against the filter
that was intended for horndog teen-agers looking for naked pictures
of Star Trek: Voyager's Seven of Nine _ at least those teen-agers
with parents responsible enough to enable the filter.
</P>
<P>
   An AOL account can have multiple users with different screen
names, but only the big honcho who first set up the account _ and,
since a credit card was required, is presumably at least 18 _ can
adjust the parental controls. I'm guessing your kids set you up as
a peon on their account.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that what you've been trying to look at is dirty. At
least that's what we'll tell the kids. The sites probably don't
carry any of the embedded information AOL is looking for in order
to rate them. If it doesn't know for sure, stuff gets blocked.
</P>
<P>
   You can tell right away if you're the boss. Just go to the
parental controls part of the member setup and try to change your
login to 18-plus. Or have those rotten kids do it.
</P>
<P>
   If you're the only user of the account, and you're already set
to 18-plus, then something is goobered up elsewhere. I'd uninstall
AOL to wipe out any bogus settings, then reinstall the latest
version. And if that doesn't work, I'd guilt the kids into getting
you an account with a real Internet service provider instead of
depending on AOL's gateway to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: My 56K modem connects to AOL at around 28K.
Only rarely do I get anything above 30K. My neighbors have no
trouble connecting at 56K.
</P>
<P>
   _ Slow Burn
</P>
<P>
   DEAR BURN: Almost nobody connects at 56K. There are too many
things out there conspiring to slow you down. I feel lucky to get
on at 31.2 from home, and I'm using the finest equipment I could
hide in my briefcase on the way home from the office. Maybe you
should ignore that last part.
</P>
<P>
   You might have cruddy wiring in your house. Maybe you have a
cheap modem with out-of-date brains. Maybe you're dialing into a
lousy connection. Maybe the modem you're connecting with is limited
to 28.8. Maybe you have bad karma.
</P>
<P>
   Haul your rig next door where they supposedly get 56K
connections and see what happens. That should narrow things down.
Or try dialing other 56K modems, like the one on 3Com's bulletin
board ( (847) 262-6000). You may just have to live with 28.8. It
isn't really that horrendous. You kids today are just spoiled. In
my day, we downloaded barefoot all day at 300 baud, and we never
complained. We made our own electricity with hand cranks and
coconut shells filled with salt water, and when that didn't work,
we'd hook up our telegraph keys, which in those days were called
hyperambulatators, to the streetcar combine's secret Tesla coil
flux generators. ...

   G8-KOSOVO _ COLOGNE, Germany _ At the opening of the Group of
Eight summit meeting here on Friday, National Security Advisor
Samuel E. Berger said the White House still is uncertain, a week
after the fact, why Russian troops deployed to Kosovo and what it
says about the state of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's control
there. The Clinton administration feels the troop decision was made
amid a fog of uncertainty inside Moscow and, as a result, the
United States is no longer sure quite what it's dealing with. Will
fold in the day's other developments out of Helsinki and Cologne,
including details on a massive (approaching $50 billion) debt
relief program. Developing. (Deans, Cox News Service).

   CLINTON-G8 _ COLOGNE, Germany _ Bouyed by his leadership of a
NATO win in Kosovo, the strongest American economy in a generation
and the fading echoes of his House impeachment six months ago
Saturday, President Clinton is projecting an air of fresh authority
at the annual summit of seven of the world's most powerful heads of
state. Walking tall among his counterparts, Clinton appeared
comfortably in control of the agenda Friday, as the G-7 leaders
opened a weekend of talks on issues ranging from Balkans
reconstruction to debt
</P>
<P>
   relief for developing countries. And he drew one accolade after
another from his fellow heads of state for his role in leading his
NATO partners in the coalition air war against Yugoslavia's bloody
repression in Kosovo. (Deans, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA-G8 _ MOSCOW _ If the Group of Eight industrialized
nations were a country club, Russia would be like the annoying
member who cannot afford to pay the dues, but dominates the debate
during the club meeting. Turbulent relations between Russia and the
world's seven richest nations threaten to overshadow the three-day
summit of the G-8, which opened Friday in Cologne, Germany. Russian
President Boris Yeltsin is not scheduled to arrive at the summit
until Sunday. (Holmes, Cox News Service) 30.

   MEXICO-QUAKE _ PUEBLA, Mexico _ Many of the buildings damaged
here in Tuesday's earthquake are colonial architectural jewels that
date back hundreds of years. The temblar raises questions about the
future of structures in Puebla and other cities. Loosened by the
earthquake, chunks of brick and plaster were thrown from the
baroque cupolas' graceful arches, landing on a cracked floor at the
state university of Puebla. Stunned by the death of 17 people in
the region _ a toll that was expected to rise _ residents of this
city of 1.2 million also mourned the damage to buildings whose
baroque, renaissance and Arabic-influenced architecture have been a
source of pride and a draw for tourists from around the world.

   YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO CRISIS
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-KLA _ VERDAN, Yugoslavia _ German soldiers detained 25
ethnic Albanian rebels today after finding one elderly man dead and
more than 15 others hurt in a police station that had been under
control of the Kosovo Liberation Army since early this week. Most
of the victims seemed to be ethnic Albanians or Gypsies between the
ages of 50 and 60, said Lt. Col. Dietmar Jeserich, a spokesman for
the German army serving in the Kosovo peace force in the region.
The Kosovo Liberation Army moved Friday to repair its ties with
U.S. peacekeepers by promising to release five kidnapped hostages
who it described as Serb war criminals. A KLA brigade commander
said in an interview that he had told the top U.S. commander of the
82nd Airborne Division that from now on he was going to leave it up
to NATO investigate war crimes. Even with this development, NATO
faces problems trying to keep peace between the KLA and the Serbs.
In one region with 43 villages and 56,000 people, Americans are
making do with only 200 peacekeepers. (Albright, Cox News Service).

   KOSOVO-RAPE _ PEC, Yugoslavia _ At the Hotel Karagac here,
mentioned prominently in the U.S. State Department's report on Serb
atrocities in Kosovo as the site of a ``rape camp,'' there are
small signs of the horrors that are believed to have taken place.
But NATO peacekeepers have yet to investigate the hotel because
it's ``low on their priority list'' the Kosovo Liberation Army and
Serb troops are still fighting on the roads around it. Developing.

   WASTE _ They couldn't stop the poop from getting in the water,
so now federal regulators are considering weakening the rules on
Florida utilities' widespread practice of pumping treated sewage
deep underground - waste that the feds acknowledge is seeping into
potential drinking water supplies. The U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency says the rules may be unreasonably strict, since
Florida's geology makes it impossible to guarantee that the waste
won't escape upward from the depths of the Floridan Aquifier. The
EPA insists it would make sure none of the waste is dangerous by
the time it reaches drinking water. But the idea horrifies
environmentalists. ``EPA's proposed solution is to legalize the
contamination rather than prevent it,'' says Suzi Ruhl of the Legal
Environmental Assistance Foundation, which has been fighting for
years to rein in the underground injections. Waste has shown up in
shallower monitor wells of Seacoast Utilities in northern Palm
Beach County and other areas around Flroida. (King, Palm Beach

   FREEDOM-RIDERS _ ATLANTA _ In 1964, civil rights freedom rider

Coalition, to introduce a new generation to Chaney's struggle for

   BULLOCK-OBIT _ AUSTIN _ Two unavoidable cliches: Former Lt. Gov.
Bob Bullock really was larger than life. And his death really does
mark the end of an era. Bullock died Friday morning at home,
surrounded by family. A first-generation Texan, Bullock fiercely
embraced the state's colorful history and did more than his part to
preserve and contribute to it. His temper could melt a brass
doorknob, but he was considerate of his friends. He could be
courtly and combative, gentlemanly and lewd, magnanimous and
unforgiving, humble and intimidating, persuasive and threatening _
all within seconds. He also pushed through monumental programs _
changing everything from the way Texas collects taxes to how it
funds its schools _ and never shied from a little political
bloodletting for what he believed to be in the best interest of
Texans. (Beach, Austin American-Statesman). WITH PHOTOS.

   FAULDER-SCENE _ HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ Described by prison
officials as being peaceful and calm, Joseph Stanley Faulder, 61,
became the first Canadian executed in the United States in 47 years
on Thursday. ``He said he was at peace with his maker and ready to
go, and one way or another, he would be set free tonight,'' Texas
Department of Criminal Justice Public Information Officer Larry
Todd said. Faulder was sentenced to die by lethal injection for the
beating and stabbing death of 75-year-old Inez Phillips during a
1975 robbery of her home in Gladewater. (Longview News-Journal).

   BKN-FINALS-WAGERS _ U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm fired the first salvo

outlaw: ``Ask Larry Bird what a Knick is, senator. I'm sure they
have a clear idea.'' He then went on to call the San Antonio Spurs,
who are currently tangling with the New York Knicks for the
National Basketball Association Championship, ``those
tumbleweeds.'' Since the series began, harsh words and wagers have
been flying between the Empire State and the Lone Star state like
bullets in pistol duels. Gov. Bush is betting Gov. Pataki, and
mayors from New York and San Antonio are also laying it on the
line. (Davenport, Austin American-Statesman).

CHOOSING 2006 OLYMPIC SITE A SOMBER EVENT AFTER REFORMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   No champagne and caviar this time. No calfskin luggage, no
Waterford keepsakes, no five-figure ``humanitarian aid'' offers
from jostling bid cities. And no more balloting that resembles the
1924 Democratic convention.
</P>
<P>
   When the International Olympic Committee convenes in Seoul
Friday to choose the site of the 2006 Winter Games from among six
European candidates, it will do so without the lavish lobbying that
the Lords of the Rings have come to regret -- and with only two
options to choose from.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the handout scandal surrounding Salt Lake City's
2002 bid, with its expulsions, resignations and worldwide calls for
reform, the IOC banned its members from visiting candidate cities
and stopped cities from giving them anything more than trinkets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see any kind of gifts, any kind of bribes,'' Marco San
Pietro, international relations director for the Turin bid
committee, said by phone Thursday from Seoul. ``Everything is
forbidden. You can't even give a pen.''
</P>
<P>
   And for the first time in its history, the IOC is allowing
outsiders to help choose a host city. A special 15-member
``selection college,'' including three athletes and two
representatives from the winter sports federations and national
Olympic committees, will narrow the field from the six bidders
(Sion, Switzerland; Turin; Helsinki; Klagenfurt, Austria; Zakopane,
Poland and Poprad-Tatry, Slovakia) to two finalists. Then, shortly
after midnight in the United States, the full IOC will choose the
victor.
</P>
<P>
   Though the new system, which the IOC says is experimental, is
designed to limit the suspicious horse-trading between bidders and
members that marked previous elections, it has undeniable flaws. It
gives a distinct advantage to Sion, which hosted dozens of IOC
members when it was bidding for the 2002 Games. And it forces
voters to rely for information on hour-long presentations, a report
from the IOC's site evaluation commission and on piles of brochures
and CD-ROMs (``virtual visits'') from cities they've never seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you fall in love with a lady without seeing her, just by
reading a book about her?'' complained Vitaly Smirnov, an IOC
member from Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The travel ban fell hardest on Klagenfurt, which is offering a
unique ``bid without borders'' that includes nearby venues in Italy
and Slovenia. ``Some IOC members think we have very long
distances,'' says bid leader Michael Ausserwinkler. ``It would have
been fantastic to show them that a citizen of Klagenfurt leaves his
job at 5 o'clock and at 6 he is eating dinner in Slovenia.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Sion is the clear favorite, observers have been
whispering about a possible anti-Swiss backlash directed at Marc
Hodler, the IOC member from Switzerland who fueled the scandal in
December by claiming that at least a quarter of his colleagues had
been taking payoffs from bid cities for years.
</P>
<P>
   But the most obvious backlash is being directed at the
Americans, whom some members accuse of creating the worst scandal
in IOC history by seducing them with cash and gifts then demanding
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem inherent to corruption was born from people of
Salt Lake City,'' said IOC member Mario Vasquez Rana of Mexico.
``I'm sorry to say this is something that comes from that wonderful
country, the United States of America.''
</P>

YOU DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO ...

<TEXT>
<P>
   Every now and then, amid the gigabytes of worthless information
that clog e-mail accounts on a daily basis, a diamond in the rough
will appear that begs to be polished and displayed for all to see.
</P>
<P>
   Such a treasure popped up in a recent missive from someone whose
identity is a mystery. But it immediately grabbed the attention of
this devotee of the Constitution since the subject line was ``Bill
of Rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The message said that the following ``Bill of No Rights'' was
attributed to state Rep. Mitchell Kaye of Georgia, ``and the rest
of us thank her for stating our thoughts.''
</P>
<P>
   Kaye, for the record, is a male representative from Marietta,
Ga., and he was not the originator of the piece. His capitol office
in Atlanta was helpful, however, in providing the Web site address
of the Oregon-based Backwoods Home Magazine _ a publication
dedicated to ``practical ideas for self-reliant living'' _ which
recently published the Bill of No Rights, a copyrighted piece
written several years ago by one Lewis Napper, a self-described
amateur philosopher and Libertarian from Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ``WE, the sensible people of the United States, in an attempt to
help everyone get along, restore some semblance of justice, avoid
any more riots, keep our nation safe, promote positive behavior,
and secure the blessings of debt free liberty to ourselves and our
great-great-great grandchildren, hereby try one more time to ordain
and establish some common sense guidelines for the terminally
whiny, guilt-ridden, delusional and other liberal bedwetters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hold these truths to be self-evident: that a whole lot of
people are confused by the Bill of Rights and are so dim that they
require a Bill of No Rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Article I: You do not have the right to a new car, big screen
TV or any other form of wealth. More power to you if you can
legally acquire them, but no one is guaranteeing anything.

<P>
   ``Article II: You do not have the right to never be offended.
This country is based on freedom, and that means freedom for

housing. Americans are the most charitable people to be found, and
will gladly help anyone in need, but we are quickly growing weary

potatoes who achieve nothing more than the creation of another
generation of professional couch potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Article V: You do not have the right to free health care. That
would be nice, but from the looks of public housing, we're just not
interested in public health care.
</P>

   ``Article VII: You do not have the right to the possessions of
others. If you rob, cheat or coerce away the goods or services of
other citizens, don't be surprised if the rest of us get together

to a big screen TV or a life of leisure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Article VIII: You don't have the right to demand that our
children risk their lives in foreign wars to soothe your aching
conscience. We hate oppressive governments and won't lift a finger
to stop you from going to fight if you'd like. However, we do not

of our time battling each and every little tyrant with a military
uniform and a funny hat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Article IX: You don't have the right to a job. All of us sure

 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Inculcated, that was the word George Bush used.
He said he had the drive to serve inculcated into him by his
father, the future senator from Connecticut, Prescott Bush, who
believed in noblesse oblige, believed it was the solemn obligation
of the elite to serve for the greater societal good. The future
senator inculcated that belief into his second son, the future
president, George Herbert Walker Bush. That son went off to West
Texas, and he raised a family and did some inculcating of his own.
In those days, when the Kennedys reigned as American royalty, the
senior senator's son was on occasion heard to say, ``Just wait till
I turn these Bush boys out.''
</P>
<P>
   The oldest of those Bush boys _ George Dubya, as he is known in
Texas _ is poised to continue the family tradition. After months of
conspicuously not running for president, he finally made it clear
in Iowa last Saturday that he is seeking the office.
</P>
<P>
   The first election of the 21st century then, we currently
assume, may be The Clash of the Scions, Al Gore vs. George W. Bush.
One, Gore, went to Vietnam and didn't fight; the other, Bush, flew
fighter jets and didn't go to Vietnam. One toked a little pot; the
other declines to give a full accounting of his youthful
indiscretions and emphatically considers the matter closed. The
public perceives one as exuding the charisma and warmth of a cheap
Formica countertop; the other is regarded, even by his frustrated
political enemies, as impossible to personally dislike. One has
spent decades being groomed for this moment; the other has
strenuously spent at least the last year not running for president,
listening to the whole world tell him it's his to lose.
</P>
<P>
   From New Haven to Midland
</P>
<P>
   George Walker Bush was born in New Haven, Conn., on July 6,
1946.
</P>
<P>
   When the Bushes moved to Midland, Texas, in 1950, it was still a
small town. Barbara Bush gave birth to John Ellis Bush, the future
governor of Florida whom the family would call Jebbie, in February
1953. (Two other Bush boys, Marvin and Neil, as well as a daughter,
Doro, would follow.) But a family tragedy loomed, too: Pauline
Robinson Bush, George W.'s younger sister, would die of leukemia in
October before her 4th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The elder George Bush was in Houston by the time he ran for the
U.S. Senate against Ralph Yarborough in 1964. Yarborough wouldn't
debate, so Bush and his pal Martin Allday came up with the famous
empty-chair debates, with a tape recording on a chair sitting in
for Yarborough. They got a lot of mileage out of that, but LBJ was
in the White House by then and his coattails stretched from El Paso
to Nacogdoches.
</P>
<P>
   Young George W., when home on break from Andover, sat in on
strategy meetings. And on election night, in the Houston ballroom
his dad had rented for the victory reception that never happened,
young George W. wept.
</P>
<P>
   George W. went to prep school in Massachusetts. He enrolled in
Phillips Academy, which sits atop a long, gradual hill stretching
through Andover. Think of one of those perennially autumnal places,
hundreds of acres of trees and brick and scowling faculty who are
addressed as ``sir.''
</P>
<P>
   Morning chapel was mandatory, as was jacket and tie. The class
work was unrelenting. Fear, intimidation and humiliation were
trusted teaching tools.
</P>
<P>
   Also, no girls. The educational wisdom of the day maintained
that a boy could not have a top-notch education bludgeoned _
inculcated _ into him while in the agitating presence of the fair
sex.
</P>
<P>
   Young George was a social creature, one who went out of his way
to make everybody comfortable. It was here that Bush honed an
essential political skill: getting along with everybody.
</P>
<P>
   Bush roommate John Kidde: ``George and I played sports _ I
played a lot of sports _ and there are some kids at Andover who are
not very outgoing or socially dialed-in, nerds or whatever you want
to call them. I remember two or three of us would be getting lunch
and there'd be Joe Blow, one of the straight-A students who never
talked and nobody socialized with him, and we'd sit down and start
talking and George would make a joke or a comment and always bring
this guy into the conversation, make him a part of the group. He
was real good at that. He always made people feel very comfortable
around him.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his kind nature, Bush was known as ``Lip'' for his
lightning wit.
</P>
<P>
   ``George was quick with a quip,'' said Jack Morrison, a close
friend from Andover and Yale. ``He always had a twinkle in his eye
and a ready retort in his mouth. He often got the last word in.''
</P>
<P>
   Senior year was when boys found whether they were going to their
first-choice college. Like the old man, George W. Bush was going to
Yale.
</P>
<P>
   The summer of '68
</P>
<P>
   At Yale, where he would earn a degree in history, they all
seemed to love George W. Everybody except John Lincoln, who lived
across the hall from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``George was a member of Deke, the fraternity known to be the
drinking fraternity,'' Lincoln said. Nor did Lincoln, a computer
graphic artist, find the younger Bush's intellect to be formidable.
When word of Bush's White House ambition got out, ``I said to
myself, `You know, he's not all that smart.' Which is maybe what
the job takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and the boys let the good times roll, Morrison says: ``The
things I remember are the times we would go on road trips and just
be weak with laughter,'' said Morrison, a partner in a private
investment firm in Minneapolis. ``We'd pile into a car and head off
to some girls' school up north. Never really got in any serious
trouble at all, but came close a couple of times. There were a
couple of times when you could say we probably consumed more than
we should have, but nothing terribly serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, out in the world, everything was out of the ordinary.
Vietnam, or how to avoid it, was the topic of every other
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   If political ambition beat in George W. Bush's breast at Yale,
it was well-concealed. George's passions, despite his father's
political proclivities, were sports and beer. And fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the Reserves
</P>
<P>
   The document is on Air Force letterhead, dated 7 October 1968.
``The Secretary of the Air Force has directed me to inform you
that, by direction of the President, you are tendered an indefinite
term appointment as a Reserve officer of the Air Force.''
</P>
<P>
   He trained until June 1970, then assumed reserve status in the
Texas Air National Guard, flying F-102 fighters out of Ellington
Air Force Base. George W. Bush was 23, a first lieutenant and a
hotshot.
</P>
<P>
   Young men were getting creative in handling the Vietnam problem.
Hockey saved Morrison. He made the 1968 Olympic team, and the
powers that be decided he'd be better off doing battle on the ice
rather than in the rice paddies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the things that makes me a little uncomfortable,''
said Morrison, who served in a reserve unit. ``I sometimes feel I
should have gone to Vietnam. Because I happened to be a good hockey
player, I was able to avoid that. At the time I was delighted _ I'd
just married and had a young child, so I didn't especially want to
go get shot at. And I think George may feel the same way a little
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   That's probably as close as we'll get to how Bush feels about
Vietnam. Bush has said he did not join the Guard to avoid service
in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush requested a discharge from the Texas Air National
Guard on 5 Sept. 73. It was approved a day later, and he was off to
Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   To the oil patch born
</P>
<P>
   Despite his newly minted MBA, the corporate path was not the way
for George W. Bush. He was young, he was cocky, and he'd had a
pretty good independent streak inculcated into him. He went back to
Midland. And when he saw opportunity, he impulsively went after it:
He surprised a number of friends when he ran for Congress in '78.
</P>
<P>
   His opponent, then-Democrat Kent Hance, had big fun with Bush's
pedigree and Ivy League book learnin' _ and thereafter Bush threw
himself into the oil business. His father's company had been called
Zapata, so Bush continued the tradition by starting Arbusto,
Spanish for ``bush'' and pronounced ``Ar-BOOST-o.'' But the
infrequent success of the company soon had locals calling the
company Ar-BUST-o, and Bush changed the name to the more pedestrian
but less easily ridiculed Bush Exploration.
</P>
<P>
   In 1984, Bush Exploration folded into Spectrum 7 Energy Corp.,
of Cincinnati, Ohio, and Midland. The move also established a
baseball connection that would in little more than a decade lead to
a big payday for George W. Bush: Spectrum included William DeWitt
Jr., the son of the owner who had built the Cincinnati Reds into
the Big Red Machine.
</P>
<P>
   Although beginning to move in tonier circles, Bush was never
what you'd call a GQ type _ if it matched, it was a miracle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very frugal,'' said Charles Younger, a doctor from
Midland who returned about the same time as Don Evans, now Bush's
campaign finance director. ``He never spent any money. He was
perfectly content in a pair of Levi's and a T-shirt and an old pair
of Chinese house slippers he wore everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   He had one dark suit, which he wore to out-of-town meetings up
East with Spectrum geologist Paul Rea. One morning he was supposed
to meet Rea at the airport before dawn. Bush is late, flies out the
door, leaps into his old Buick and takes off and drives into D
Street, which happens to be full of water. The water's so high he
can't even open the driver's door. So Bush rolls down the window
and strips to his boxers, climbs out the window, wades through the
street and starts running back to his house, past the residence of
an early-rising bank president, who chances to begin his day by
observing young George dashing along in his underwear.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's impulsive, impatient,'' Younger said. ``He's a man of
action. He's not gonna sit there.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, friends and associates from the Midland days
suggest that the elder Bush, by then the vice president of the
United States, wasn't always delighted with the way the younger
Bush conducted himself. Which is to say nothing of what his mother
thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there were times they'd rather he maybe bit his tongue
or zipped his mouth,'' Younger said. ``He'd just stay right out
there on the edge. He'd never hop over, but he'd lean over.
Mischievous.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also, let us not forget, Midland's most eligible
bachelor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He rarely dated,'' said Joe O'Neill, a friend since preschool.
``He was an early-riser, party-pooper kind of date.''
</P>
<P>
   Younger: ``I doubt if he ever took a girl out more than three or
four times other than Laura. I don't think there was anybody who
caught his attention, to be honest with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Catch his attention she did. The cockiness throttled way back
when he was around Laura, and George W. Bush seemed almost . . .
reserved. They were engaged five weeks after they met, and married
in the First Methodist Church in downtown Midland, Laura's family
church _ right in the middle of W.'s run for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Laura, a calming influence on all those around her, did some
inculcating. George was the same old George, just not cranked all
the way up.
</P>
<P>
   The recrafting
</P>
<P>
   The Oxford English Dictionary, second edition, defines
``inculcate'' thus: ``To endeavor to force (a thing) into or
impress (it) on the mind of another by emphatic admonition, or by
persistent repetition; to urge on the mind, esp. as a principle, an
opinion, or a matter of belief; to teach forcibly.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine this inculcation of the need to serve, something George
W. inherited just as he inherited the grin and the eyebrows from
preceding generations. Imagine that this trait is like any other
genetic propensity. At some point in one's life, a switch flips,
cells begin dividing and before long a fully inculcated George W.
Bush emerges as The Son Who Will Serve the Father, a Sonny Corleone
type whose volatility sometimes gets the best of his judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Were it not for the inculcation, he may well have stayed in
Midland, continuing his modestly successful business career. But he
answered the call, and a newer, more mature George W. Bush emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Rough around the edges? Yes and no. Somebody was dressing him
better, but Bush still had plenty of Midland in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was working for him in '87, he was still chewing
tobacco, which is a pretty gross trait,'' said Deborah Dunn, who
worked for two years as Bush's assistant before becoming director
of the White House Visitors Office and, later, helping run George
W.'s upset of Ann Richards. ``I'd bring in his campaign itinerary,
and stacks of material I'd already sorted through. He didn't want
excessive detail. And by noon, three-quarters of the stuff would be
in the trash can. And here he was chewing tobacco and spitting in
the trash can, and when he'd go for his noon jog I'd be picking the
stuff out of the trash can and I'd think, `You couldn't have read
this.' But he had, and picked out the facts and put it somewhere in
his mind and moved on.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember the '88 convention? It seemed like half the delegates
in the hall were Bushes, but it was George W. who gave Texas to the
old man, thereby giving the old man the nomination. A great
dynastic moment.
</P>
<P>
   The Natural
</P>
<P>
   He loved baseball _ always said he wanted to play like Willie
Mays when he was a younger man. After he and Laura and the girls
moved to Dallas, darned if he didn't jump in on a deal to buy the
Texas Rangers. He put up $606,000 _ chump change compared with the
other partners _ but he'd get 20 times that on the back end in a
few years. They make him general manager, and there he is running
the team. This is the best job in the whole world for George W.
Bush, who gets along with everybody, knows the office people and
the groundskeeper and the hot-dog vendor, signs autographs and
chats up fans and players. A $200,000 salary (what the president
pulls down) and part ownership in the team _ to watch baseball!
</P>
<P>
   Former Spectrum 7 partner Rea: ``George felt like to get into
politics you needed some personal money, and that was his goal _ to
make enough money where his family would be comfortable and he
wouldn't be beholden to special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   There was quiet talk of running George W. Bush against Richards
in '90 _ Richards went after Dad with that ``poor George'' riff at
the '88 convention, about how ``Poppy'' Bush was ``born with a
silver foot in his mouth.'' Wouldn't it be nice to step up and boot
her out of the governor's office? But George W. didn't run _ told
Rea his mother didn't want him to, for one thing.
</P>
<P>
   When the first son did take on Richards, in '94, she let him
have it. Dubya took the jabs and kept smiling. Richards would say
Bush was a failed businessman; Bush would mourn the governor's
compulsive use of ``personal attacks.'' Richards noted Bush had
never before held elected office; Bush wore his inexperience as a
badge of honor. Morrison says Bush's conduct in the campaign
against Richards showed maturity and clarity of purpose: ``She just
savaged him, and he just killed her with kindness.''
</P>
<P>
   So when he was young and irresponsible and cocky, he was young
and irresponsible and cocky. Now he's mature and responsible and,
well, his friend and former business partner K. Michael Conaway
uses the word ``mercurial,'' meaning volatile. Hot-headed.
</P>
<P>
   He does not suffer fools. He has little time for dissent, and
none whatsoever for disloyalty. He was the loyalty enforcer for his
dad and has continued, as governor, to demand tributes from his
allies, who are expected to cough up money and salute smartly.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's the characterization of Tom Pauken, a onetime
state Republican chairman whose run for attorney general was
derailed by Bush loyalists _ and one of the few Texas Republicans
publicly critical of the popular governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't know what moves the governor,'' Pauken said.
</P>
<P>
   So why's he running?
</P>
<P>
   Pauken: ``I guess to follow Bill Clinton after Clinton defeated
his father would prove something.''
</P>
<P>
   The assumption of George W. Bush
</P>
<P>
   A second President Bush seems to be a foregone conclusion. The
belief that the 2000 election has an inevitable conclusion _ let's
just go ahead and call it manifest destiny _ has been thoroughly
inculcated into the electorate and the media.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody can catch him, the media seem to be saying, and he hasn't
even officially declared.
</P>
<P>
   All he needs to do is say so. All we need to know is who he is.
With his campaign swing through Iowa and New Hampshire this month,
George W. Bush took his first tentative steps, and the process of
getting to know him is under way.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   ... with kindness.
</P>
<P>
   The mercurial George W.
</P>
<P>
   So when he was young and irresponsible and cocky, he was young
and irresponsible and cocky. Now he's mature and responsible and,
well, his friend and former business partner K. Michael Conaway
uses the word ``mercurial,'' meaning volatile. Hot-headed.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his best efforts, it leaks out sometimes publicly.
Reporters often don't finish asking their questions before he
starts answering them, but if a reporter steps on one of his
answers, Bush is likely to lower his head and politely seethe,
``May I finish, please?'' He's like this privately, too; his allies
say it's because he's so well-prepared and moves so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the time when a bunch of Canadian reporters were
whining about the planned execution of one of their own, Joseph
Stanley Faulder. When Bush was asked what he would say to the
charge that Texas' enthusiastic application of the needle gave the
state a sort of Wild West air, the governor let fly, ``If you're
Canadian and you come to our state, don't murder anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   He's tamped down that habit of launching strategic zingers, but
the noncampaign will be a long one. At some point, the Lip will
prevail.
</P>
<P>
   He does not suffer fools. He has little time for dissent, and
none whatsoever for disloyalty. He was the loyalty enforcer for his
dad and has continued, as governor, to demand tributes from his
allies, who are expected to cough up money and salute smartly.
</P>
<P>
   At least, that's the characterization of Tom Pauken, a onetime
state Republican chairman whose run for attorney general was
derailed by Bush loyalists _ and one of few Texas Republicans
publicly critical of the popular governor.
</P>
<P>
   True, Pauken is a conservative Christian whose ideological tent
wasn't big enough for a Republican like George W. Bush _ the kind
who can win elections. But the conflict seemed to him at its root
personal: Pauken didn't support George Bush in his '88 run for
president, and George W. ``expressed his disappointment with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years later Bush was governor and in a position to once
again express his disappointment with Pauken, which he did.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're supposed to salute,'' he said. ``If you don't salute
you're an opponent. And Karl Rove, the political genius of the Bush
operation, is very single-minded as far as making anybody pay a
price who's not 100 percent on board.''
</P>
<P>
   Pauken's Machiavellian interpretation of the Rove-Bush dynamic
is a popular one: Rove is the mechanic, this reading goes; Bush is
simply pointed in the right direction and instructed to flash that
big, famous mug _ George W. Bush as anti-wonk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't know what moves the governor,'' Pauken said.
</P>
<P>
   So why's he running?
</P>
<P>
   Pauken: ``I guess to follow Bill Clinton after Clinton defeated
his father would prove something.''
</P>
<P>
   Feeling Presidential
</P>
<P>
   Before the legislative session ended Memorial Day, Bush went to
great effort to appear focused on the state's business. Before the
session began, he was a cautious man, doing the political math and
keeping the Lip on a tight leash. He even refused to state a
position on whether he would dance with Laura at the inaugural
balls. (He did.) Public appearances were tightly scripted and
usually ceremonial. He had hardly a word to say about any national
issue, and anyway he was too busy to be as available to the press
as he'd been before. Meanwhile, Republican big shots from across
the country were double-parked on the streets around the governor's
mansion, delivering gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh.
</P>
<P>
   The only flashes of spontaneity were at bill signings, where
Bush would take a few questions. He's got most of the capitol press
well-trained by now. He greets favored ones with exaggerated
deference and chummy nicknames; once, alluding to his habit of
rushing through everything, even signing his name, he joked to a TV
camerawoman, ``I understand you've requested a slow signing.''
Everybody had a nice chuckle at that one.
</P>
<P>
   The traditional arena for these episodes was the governor's
press conference room, a functional but unsexy space with bright
lights and a riser in back for the TV cameras. But on May 25, the
morning the Cox report was released, Bush's meeting with the press
was moved from there _ the previously stated location _ to the
governor's reception room next door. That room is as grand and
dignified as the press conference room is utilitarian. George W.
Bush acknowledged that the Lege was still steaming along and that
he had some time before his victory-lap-slash-summer-tour, but he
had something to say and he was going to say it in a stately
setting in front of the gathered TV cameras and it was this:
</P>
<P>
   He was firmly opposed to China stealing American nuclear
secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The Assumption of George W. Bush
</P>
<P>
   ``Inculcate'' comes from the Latin inculcatus, meaning to tread
down or trample underfoot. It means to impress upon the mind via
frequent repetition _ the old-fashioned, rote way of learning. The
belief that the 2000 election has an inevitable conclusion _ let's
just go ahead and call it manifest destiny _ has been thoroughly
inculcated into the electorate and the media. A second President
Bush is considered a foregone conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody can catch him, the media seem to be saying, and he hasn't
even officially declared.
</P>
<P>
   All he needs to do is say so. All we need to know is who he is.
With his campaign swing through Iowa and New Hampshire beginning
last Saturday, George W. Bush took his first tentative steps, and
the process of getting to know him is under way.

   AUSTIN, Texas _ Inculcated, that was the word George Bush used.
He said he had the drive to serve inculcated into him by his
father, the future senator from Connecticut, Prescott Bush, who
believed in noblesse oblige, believed it the solemn obligation of
the elite to serve for the greater societal good. The future
senator inculcated that belief into his second son, the future
president, George Herbert Walker Bush. That son went off to West
Texas, and he raised a family and did some inculcating of his own.
In those days, when the Kennedys reigned as American royalty, the
senior senator's son was on occasion heard to say, ``Just wait till
I turn these Bush boys out.''
</P>
<P>
   The oldest of those Bush boys _ George Dubya, as he is known in
Texas _ is now poised to continue the family tradition. After
months of conspicuously not running for president, he finally made
it clear in Iowa last Saturday that he is seeking the office.
</P>
<P>
   The first election of the 21st century then, we currently
assume, will be The Clash of the Scions, Al Gore vs. George W.
Bush. One, Gore, went to Vietnam and didn't fight; the other, Bush,
flew fighter jets and didn't go to Vietnam. One toked a little pot;
the other declines to give a full accounting of his youthful
indiscretions and emphatically considers the matter closed. The
public perceives one as exuding the charisma and warmth of a cheap
Formica countertop; the other is regarded, even by his frustrated
political enemies, as impossible to personally dislike. One has
spent decades being groomed for this moment; the other has
strenuously spent at least the last year not running for president,
listening to the whole world tell him it's his to lose.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning: Driving to the moon in a Studebaker
</P>
<P>
   The other officers aboard the aircraft carrier San Jacinto just
loved calling him by his patrician full name _
George-Herbert-Walker-Bush. But he was one of the guys _ even had
his wife's name, Barbara, painted on his plane, and that went
against the rules. So thorough was his inculcation that he joined
the service the day he turned 18. He flew bombers, and one day,
Sept. 2, 1944, over the Bonin Islands in the Pacific, he took heavy
flak en route to his target. He toughed it through the fire, made
his drop, headed back out to sea and ditched his TBM Avenger. The
other two guys didn't make it _ he'd called for them before he
bailed out and heard nothing.
</P>
<P>
   George-Herbert-Walker-Bush _ ``Poppy'' back home _ was rescued
and returned a war hero, although he'd never think to use the term
_ his mother taught him not to brag, to give the other guy credit.
He went to Yale, as his father had, and found time for 16
activities, everything from captain of the baseball team to the
secret society Skull and Bones. At their wedding reception in the
first week of 1945, Poppy told Barbara, or Bar, as she was also
known: ``Enjoy it. It's the last time I'll ever dance in public.''
Or so the story goes.
</P>
<P>
   George Walker Bush was born in New Haven, Conn., on July 6,
1946.
</P>
<P>
   The very senior senator gave George-Herbert-Walker-Bush a red
two-door Studebaker, and the day after graduation in the summer of
1948, Poppy loaded that car up and pointed it west, arranging for
Bar and baby George to follow. They were headed for an outpost so
remote it may as well have been outer space to the Bushes of
Greenwich: Odessa, Texas, where dust storms were major
meteorological events, where George Bush and scores of other
postwar Ivy League grads intended to make their fortunes in oil.
The place was pregnant with the stuff _ you could stick a dessert
fork in the ground in those days and make a major discovery. After
a brief time in California, the family moved 20 miles down the road
from Odessa to Midland, which had one big advantage over Odessa:
There the family could get away from the mother-daughter prostitute
tag team who lived and worked on the other side of the crudely
partitioned shotgun duplex on East Seventh Street. By 1952 _ the
year Prescott Bush, back in Connecticutt, won election to the U.S.
Senate _ Midland was the boomingest boomtown in West Texas, with
$22 million worth of building permits. (By the end of the decade
those homes and businesses would be empty. Welcome to the oil
bidness.) Hank Williams died on New Year's Eve of that year.
Eisenhower was president, Shivers was governor, polio was still a
threat, and one Master Haskell Goebel Harris was heralded in a
full-page ad in the local paper as ``Midland County's first white
baby of 1953.''
</P>
<P>
   It was still a small town, or had been when the Bushes arrived
in 1950. Although Midland would sprout a cluster of tall buildings
as monuments to its sporadic affluence, paved streets in parts of
town remained a near-novelty. Then there was the really baffling
thing about the Permian Basin: no trees. Or rather, a few dejected,
transplanted saplings that looked none too pleased, seemed to be
asking, ``Why me?'' Barbara Bush gave birth to John Ellis Bush, the
future governor of Florida whom the family would call Jebbie, in
February 1953. (Two other Bush boys, Marvin and Neil, as well as a
daughter, Doro, would follow.) But a family tragedy loomed, too:
Pauline Robinson Bush, George W.'s younger sister, would die of
leukemia in October before her fourth birthday. George and Barbara
didn't tell their elder son his sister was dying.
</P>
<P>
   Bush did well enough to move the family into a nice house on
Sentinel with a swimming pool. Young George played Little League in
the neighborhood and attended Sam Houston Elementary School with
his future wife, whom he did not know.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush was in Houston by the time he ran for the U.S.
Senate against Ralph Yarborough in 1964. Yarborough wouldn't
debate, so Bush and his pal Martin Allday came up with the famous
empty-chair debates, with a tape recording on a chair sitting in
for Yarborough. They got a lot of mileage out of that, but LBJ was
in the White House by then and his coattails stretched from El Paso
to Nacogdoches.
</P>
<P>
   Young George W., when home on break from Andover, sat in on
strategy meetings. And on election night, in the Houston ballroom
his dad had rented for the victory reception that never happened,
young George W. wept.
</P>
<P>
   Winter without girls
</P>
<P>
   So this kid from Midland, a town of oil nomads as polite as the
land is flat, goes to prep school in Massachusetts. He enrolls in
Phillips Academy, which sits atop a long, gradual hill stretching
through Andover, Mass. Think of one of those perennially autumnal
places, hundreds of acres of trees and brick and scowling faculty
who will be addressed as ``sir.'' Think Holden Caulfield. Think ``A
Separate Peace.'' Think a young John Irving hanging around the gym
in gray sweats except _ oops _ he went to Exeter, Andover's
cheerfully despised rival.
</P>
<P>
   These young men had gotten into the most prestigious academy in
the United States, and they were going to be punished for it.
</P>
<P>
   Morning chapel was mandatory, as was jacket and tie. The class
work was unrelenting, the faculty unforgiving. The syllabus for
History 4, a course required of seniors and purported to be the
hardest at the school, ran 300 pages. Fear, intimidation and
humiliation were trusted teaching tools. Of one one particularly
imposing math teacher, a member of the class of '64 later told
writer Nina Savin Scott: ``I was awed and entertained by him. There
was something very engaging in the prospect of death.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, no girls. The educational wisdom of the day maintained
that a boy could not have a top-notch education bludgeoned _
inculcated _ into him while in the agitating presence of the fair
sex. Girls from Abbot, the nearby girls' school that would
eventually be absorbed into Phillips, weren't even allowed to write
letters to Phillips boys as late as 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Classmate Tom Seligson, now a producer for CBS-TV: ``I organize
the reunions, and it's like going back to a prison reunion. This
was an atmosphere where there was a lot of cruelty to other
classmates. He never did any of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Young George was instead a social creature, one who went out of
his way to make everybody comfortable, even if they weren't in his
clique. It was here that Bush, as much a New Englander as a Texan,
honed an essential political skill: getting along with everybody.
</P>
<P>
   Bush roommate John Kidde: ``George and I played sports _ I
played a lot of sports _ and there are some kids at Andover who are
not very outgoing or socially dialed-in, nerds or whatever you want
to call them. I remember two or three of us would be getting lunch
and there'd be Joe Blow, one of the straight-A students who never
talked and nobody socialized with him, and we'd sit down and start
talking and George would make a joke or a comment and always bring
this guy into the conversation, make him a part of the group. He
was real good at that. He always made people feel very comfortable
around him.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush arrived perhaps no less prepared than his classmates.
</P>
<P>
   John Kidde, who now runs a food-processing company: ``I don't
know if anybody's prepared to go to that place. I had A's and B's
before, and it still knocked my socks off. It was just really
tough. Really tough.'' Friends remember Bush as a satisfactory
student who worked hard, but who was plainly more interested in
sports than academics.
</P>
<P>
   The calendar said it was the early 1960s, but at Andover it was
still the Cold War '50s. Nine buildings were designated as fallout
shelters, stocked with two weeks' worth of food, water and
supplies. Officials reported that the buildings were sufficiently
resistant to radiation and could be made even more so in the event
of nuclear attack by covering the windows. Pop music was less of a
threat _ there was a campus combo called The Satans, but its
members didn't look much like Marilyn Manson in their natty jackets
and ties. When a few students dared to let their hair shag out like
the Beatles, school officials warned them to shape up.
</P>
<P>
   Students caught with booze could be expelled, but the
student-produced yearbook, Pot Pourri, went out of its way to show
boys in gleeful rebellion against that and other rules. Students
didn't have to work hard to get their pictures in the yearbook with
a can of Budweiser in hand, exaggeratedly scoping a Playboy or
puffing on a cigar. There are no pictures of George W. Bush so
occupied. John Kidde never saw him drink while at Andover.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush is instead shown posing with the cheerleading
squad, or outside a phone booth crammed full of boys, or acting as
high commissioner of stickball. Good, clean, boyish high jinks,
corny but not enough political dynamite to blow the good ship W2K
out of the water. In his senior picture, he wears the same
asymmetrical grin both his grandfather and father exhibited. The
eyebrows still needed some growing into.
</P>
<P>
   In the yearbook he was called a BMOC and a wit. He escaped
categorization as an intellectual, cynic, ``butt friend,''
alcoholic or social climber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lip'' came, of course, from his lightning wit.
</P>
<P>
   ``George was quick with a quip,'' said Jack Morrison, a close
friend from Andover and Yale. ``He always had a twinkle in his eye
and a ready retort in his mouth. He often got the last word in.''
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush spent that senior year down the hill in America
House, a sizable old Colonial-style dorm that looks like it's a
prime candidate for the next Sears Weatherbeater paint commercial.
It is named America House because there, in 1832, Samuel F. Smith
wrote ``America.'' (``My country, 'tis of thee . . .'' You know
that'll turn up at the convention bio-flick. Better than being from
A Place Called Hope.)
</P>
<P>
   Senior year was when boys found whether they were going to their
first-choice college. If not, life was over. Some 230 boys
graduated that year, and most of them were fed into the best four
or five schools in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Like the old man, George W. Bush was going to Yale.
</P>
<P>
   Everything Falls Apart: New Haven, 1968
</P>
<P>
   They all seemed to loved George W. at Yale. Everybody except
John Lincoln, who lived across the hall from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``George was a member of Deke, the fraternity known to be the
drinking fraternity,'' Lincoln said. Nor did Lincoln, a computer
graphic artist, find the younger Bush's intellect to be formidable.
When word of Bush's White House ambition got out, ``I said to
myself, `You know, he's not all that smart.' Which is maybe what
the job takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Those on the prep school-Ivy League track were expected to
excel, go to business or law school, put on a suit and run the
world. It had been so for generations. But the academy was on the
verge of huge change in those days. In the early '60s at Yale,
jeans were pressed and worn with a belt. Students recall no more
than a couple of rebels _ out of 4,000 _ with long hair. There'd be
day trips to Vassar, or mixers where buses would park on York
Street and disgorge loads of girls from other schools. Then, just
before the winter break of '66, three guys had the unfortunate
distinction of being the first Yalies busted for smoking pot. It
was a national scandal. Students went home and were confronted with
parents demanding to know, What on earth is going on at that
school?
</P>
<P>
   Jack Morrison was Bush's bridge partner in the unending game at
Davenport College, and he caught Bush's pitches on the Davenport
baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   ``The things I remember are the times we would go on road trips
and just be weak with laughter,'' said Morrison, a former Pillsbury
executive who now is a partner in a private investment firm in
Minneapolis. ``We'd pile into a car and head off to some girls'
school up north. Never really got in any serious trouble at all,
but came close a couple of times. There were a couple of times when
you could say we probably consumed more than we should have, but
nothing terribly serious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Binge drinking'' hadn't been coined as a term, let alone
labeled a problem. Getting loaded was a hallowed part of college
life, and the Dekes reveled in the intertwined manly pursuits of
sports and drinking. But what about the rumored dancing naked and
drunk on a bar in New Haven? ``He never danced naked anywhere as
far as I know,'' Jack Morrison said. ``There was a lot of high
jinks, but nothing out of the ordinary.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, out in the world, everything was out of the ordinary.
Lyndon Johnson killed the graduate school draft deferment, and
suddenly hordes of young men were hearing the call of divinity
school, one of a dwindling number of legitimate safe havens. Lines
of jittery young men stretched around the block from National Guard
offices. Vietnam, or how to avoid it, was the topic of every other
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   The Tet Offensive began Jan. 31, followed six weeks later by the
My Lai massacre, followed by Johnson's stunning announcement that
he would not seek re-election. Four days later, in Memphis, Tenn.,
Martin Luther King was killed. And between the end of classes and
commencement, so was Bobby Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could tell things were beginning to fall apart our senior
year,'' said Douglas Little, who was in Bush's class. ``This was
not a great time to graduate.''
</P>
<P>
   If political ambition beat in George W. Bush's breast at Yale,
it was well-concealed. Everybody knew where George Pataki _ the
future governor of New York who was a year ahead of Bush _ was
heading. Plenty of outlets were available for politically inclined
students. But George's passions, despite his father's political
proclivities, were sports and beer. And fighter jets.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   ... And fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the Reserves
</P>
<P>
   The document is on Air Force letterhead, dated 7 October 1968.
``The Secretary of the Air Force has directed me to inform you
that, by direction of the President, you are tendered an indefinite
term appointment as a Reserve officer of the Air Force.''
</P>
<P>
   He trained until June 1970, then assumed reserve status in the
Texas Air National Guard, flying F-102 fighters out of Ellington
Air Force Base. George W. Bush was 23, a first lieutenant and
thoroughly a hotshot. He was also the son of U.S. Rep. George Bush,
who was again aiming to snatch a Senate seat away from Ralph
Yarborough. (Democrat Lloyd Bentsen would knock Yarborough out in
the primary, then defeat Bush.)
</P>
<P>
   George W. was a commendable pilot, according to his service
record, and he liked it, according to a Texas Air National Guard
press release that began: ``George Walker Bush is one member of the
younger generation who doesn't get his kicks from pot or hashish or
speed. Oh, he gets high, all right, but not from narcotics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Fighters are it,'' Bush was quoted as saying. ``I've always
wanted to be a fighter pilot and I wouldn't want to fly anything
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Young men were getting very creative in handling the Vietnam
problem. Hockey saved Jack Morrison, Bush's friend from Andover and
Yale. He made the 1968 Olympic team, and the powers that be decided
he'd be better off doing battle on the ice rather than in the rice
paddies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the things that makes me a little uncomfortable,''
said Morrison, who served in a reserve unit. ``I sometimes feel I
should have gone to Vietnam. Because I happened to be a good hockey
player, I was able to avoid that. At the time I was delighted _ I'd
just married and had a young child, so I didn't especially want to
go get shot at. And I think George may feel the same way a little
bit.''
</P>
<P>
   That's as close as we'll probably get to how Bush feels about
Vietnam. Bush has said he did not join the Guard to avoid service
in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush requested a discharge from the Texas Air National
Guard on 5 Sept. 73. It was approved a day later, and he was off to
Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   To the Oil Patch Born: Boom and Arbusto
</P>
<P>
   The corporate path was not the way for George W. Bush. He was
young, he was cocky, and he'd had a pretty good independent streak
inculcated into him. He went back to Midland. And when he saw
opportunity, he impulsively went after it: He surprised a number of
friends when he ran for Congress in '78.
</P>
<P>
   His opponent, then-Democrat Kent Hance, had great fun with
Bush's pedigree and Ivy League book learnin' _ and thereafter Bush
threw himself into the oil business. He'd gone to see his dad's
friend, Martin Allday, who told him his high-priced Harvard MBA had
some holes in it _ he needed to learn the ways of the land man,
chasing titles and mineral leases and chatting up the clerks in
county courthouses. His father's company had been called Zapata, so
Bush continued the tradition by starting Arbusto, Spanish for
``bush'' and pronounced ``Ar-BOOST-o.'' As in common in the oil
business, Bush was gambling with other people's money besides his
own: His Wall Street-connected uncle had lined up a stable of
wealthy investors willing to take a chance on the novice
entrepreneur. But the infrequent success of the company soon had
local wits calling the concern Ar-BUST-o, and Bush changed the name
to the more pedestrian but less easily ridiculed Bush Exploration.
</P>
<P>
   He still had that stunning capacity for remembering names and
faces. And he remembered more than the names and faces of people
who could help him. He knew the cleaning lady at the office and the
booth attendant at the parking garage and the Odessa roughnecks on
the rigs. He knew everybody, got along with everybody and wasn't
running for anything.
</P>
<P>
   The mergers continued, like little Russian nesting dolls getting
gobbled by the next one. In 1984, Bush Exploration folded into
Spectrum 7 Energy Corp., of Cincinnati, Ohio, and Midland. The move
also established a baseball connection that would in little more
than a decade lead to a big payday for George W. Bush: Spectrum
included William DeWitt Jr., the son of the owner who had built the
Cincinnati Reds into the Big Red Machine.
</P>
<P>
   Although beginning to move in tonier circles, Bush was never
what you'd call a GQ type _ if it matched, it was a miracle. Some
of the boys in Midland had a golf tournament every year, and the
gag prize for the worst-dressed contestant was prime selections
from the George W. Bush wardrobe, polyester pants and a selection
of shirts. Bob Blake in Lubbock dragged Bush into Malouf's Fine
Apparel for Men and Women, the finest clothier there, and bought
him his running-for-Congress suit. An uncle in St. Louis would send
him his discarded shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very frugal,'' said Charles Younger, an M.D. from
Midland who returned about the same time as Bush and Don Evans, now
Bush's campaign finance director. ``He never spent any money. He
was perfectly content in a pair of Levi's and a T-shirt and an old
pair of Chinese house slippers he wore everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   He had one dark suit, which he wore to out-of-town meetings up
East with Spectrum geologist Paul Rea. One morning he's supposed to
meet Rea at the airport before dawn and they're going to catch a
flight somewhere. Bush is late, flying out the door, leaps into his
old Buick and takes off and drives into D Street, which happens to
be full of water, which is pretty much what happens on D Street in
Midland when it rains, because in Midland, when it rains, it
floods, but the sun isn't up and George is in quite a rush, and
here he is with a flooded old Buick. Water's so high he can't even
open the driver's door, and anyway that'd flood the interior. So
Bush rolls down the window and strips to his skivs _ boxers, for
those keeping score _ climbs out the window, wades through the
street and starts running back to his house, past the residence of
an early-rising bank president, who chances to begin his day by
observing young George dashing along in his underwear.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's impulsive, impatient,'' Younger said. ``He's a man of
action. He's not gonna sit there.''
</P>
<P>
   And he ran hard. Evans and Bush would meet at Younger's office
for noon runs _ not terribly long, maybe three or four miles, but
grueling. When Bush set the pace, the three of them did six-minute
miles. Maybe 6 1/2 minutes if George took pity. ``Lord, he was
brutal,'' Younger said. ``We kept up with him for a few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Carousing? In West Texas? Sure. Miller Lite was the default
adult beverage. He and some friends would head over to the Hector
County Coliseum in Odessa to catch Willie or whoever was passing
through. Rea, his companion on innumerable business trips, never
saw him drunk. Younger saw him pretty close.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would always stay within boundaries, but he'd get on the
edge,'' Younger said.
</P>
<P>
   It messes up the conventional arc of the George W. Bush story _
from unredeemable cad to born-again moral leader _ but during these
purported lost years he was also reading the Bible daily and
attending a businessmen's Bible study group. And when colleague K.
Michael Conaway's wife was dying of leukemia _ the same disease
that had killed Bush's sister three decades earlier _ George W.
would come and take the Conaways' two young sons to baseball games.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, friends and associates from the Midland days
suggest that the elder Bush, by then the vice president of the
United States, wasn't always delighted with the way the first son
conducted himself. Which is to say nothing of what his mother
thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there were times they'd rather he maybe bit his tongue
or zipped his mouth,'' Younger said. ``He's just stay right out
there on the edge. He'd never hop over, but he'd lean over.
Mischievous.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also, let us not forget, Midland's most eligible
bachelor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He rarely dated,'' said Joe O'Neill, a friend since preschool.
``He was an early-riser, party-pooper kind of date.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Younger: ``I doubt if he ever took a girl out more than
three or four times other than Laura. I don't think there was
anybody who caught his attention, to be honest with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Rea and his wife had the cream of Midland's bachelorettes come
to the house to meet Bush: ``There were a lot of ladies here who
wanted to date George,'' he said, ``but I don't think he had a real
girlfriend until he met Laura.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, boy, did he have a girlfriend. The cockiness throttled
way back when he was around Laura, and George W. Bush seemed almost
. . . reserved. They were engaged five weeks after they met, and
married in the First Methodist Church in downtown Midland, Laura's
family church _ right in the middle of W.'s run for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Laura, a calming influence on all those around her, did some
inculcating. George was the same old George, just not cranked all
the way up.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, with the mid-'80s bust looming, Rea and Bush
made a deal to merge Spectrum 7 into Harken Energy Corp. Rea struck
out on his own; Bush, who had a 13.6 percent interest in Spectrum,
didn't get a position with Harken, but he got a chunk of stock and
a seat on the board. Of Spectrum's 15 employees, Harken hired only
one, a land man. George W. Bush went out and found jobs for the
other 12.
</P>
<P>
   The Recrafting
</P>
<P>
   The Oxford English Dictionary, second edition, defines
``inculcate'' thus: ``To endeavor to force (a thing) into or
impress (it) on the mind of another by emphatic admonition, or by
persistent repetition; to urge on the mind, esp. as a principle, an
opinion, or a matter of belief; to teach forcibly.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine this inculcation of the need to serve, this (by
definition) learned behavior, has developed, over successive
generations of Bushes, a genetic component, something George W.
inherited just as he inherited the grin and the eyebrows from
preceding generations. Imagine that this trait is like any other
genetic propensity. At some point in one's life, say on a blurry
morning after a man's 40th birthday party, a switch flips, cells
begin dividing and before long a fully inculcated George W. Bush
emerges as The Son Who Will Serve the Father, a Sonny Corleone type
whose volatility sometimes gets the best of his judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Were it not for the inculcation, he may well have stayed in
Midland, continuing his modestly successful business career. But he
answered the call, and a newer, more mature George W. Bush emerged.
</P>
<P>
   He'd quit drinking. Just. Quit. Maybe it wouldn't be an issue if
he hadn't stopped (damned if you drink, damned if you don't),
because Americans find an irresistible mystery in people who drink,
then stop. We think, What else ya got in there?
</P>
<P>
   He helped his dad get elected _ sometimes he was the last person
George Bush consulted before he made a move. George W. went to
Washington to protect his dad and terrorize his enemies. Think a
nice Ivy League boy doesn't have the stuff to get up close like
this and _ bada-bing! _ pull the trigger on John Sununu? Dubya did.
</P>
<P>
   Rough around the edges? Yes and no. Somebody was dressing him
better, but Bush still had plenty of Midland in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was working for him in '87, he was still chewing
tobacco, which is a pretty gross trait,'' said Deborah Dunn, who
worked for two years as Bush's assistant before becoming director
of the White House Visitors Office and, later, helping run George
W.'s upset of Ann Richards. ``I'd bring in his campaign itinerary,
and stacks of material I'd already sorted through. He didn't want
excessive detail. And by noon, three-quarters of the stuff would be
in the trash can. And here he was chewing tobacco and spitting in
the trash can, and when he'd go for his noon jog I'd be picking the
stuff out of the trash can and I'd think, `You couldn't have read
this.' But he had, and picked out the facts and put it somewhere in
his mind and moved on.''
</P>
<P>
   Blustery? Nothing like that doomed bulldog, Lee Atwater, but
sure. Baby-sitting Atwater, in fact, was W.'s job for a time:
``Skeptical in nature, blunt to a fault, Junior was contemptuous of
haughty D.C. insiders,'' John Brady wrote in ``Bad Boy,'' his
Atwater bio. Yes, George W. had a way of making sure no ego soared
too high on that campaign. He ruffled some feathers. Could be a
hothead. Came off cocky and brash. But remember the '88 convention?
Seemed like half the delegates in the hall were Bushes, but it was
George W. who gave Texas to the old man, thereby giving the old man
the nomination. A great dynastic moment, that.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Younger: ``I think he felt responsibility. That was part
of his maturing and I think he sensed he was the oldest son, and
when his father became president, I think his role changed. I think
he assumed responsibilities within the family and without. He
decided he was going to be a devoted son, not that he wasn't
before, and he was going to step up to the plate and be on board
with his dad and mom.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe O'Neill: ``He got a real taste of the power and what you can
do. It raised his horizons.''
</P>
<P>
   The Natural
</P>
<P>
   He loved baseball _ always said he wanted to play like Willie
Mays when he was a younger man. And after he and Laura and the
girls moved to Dallas, darned if he didn't get in the middle of a
deal to buy the Texas Rangers. He put up $606,000 _ chump change
compared with the other partners, but he'd get 20 times that on the
back end in a few years. They make him general manager, and there
he is running the team, wearing those custom-made Rangers cowboy
boots in his seats right behind home plate. This is the best job in
the whole world for George W. Bush, who gets along with everybody,
knows the office people and the groundskeeper and the hot-dog
vendor, signs autographs and chats up fans and players. A $200,000
salary (what the president pulls down) and part ownership in the
team _ to watch baseball!
</P>
<P>
   All anybody talks about now is The Deal, one of those Byzantine
processes by which this country builds its monuments to sport. Such
deals always get a handful of people filthy rich and another
handful feeling thoroughly shafted. But they built the new
Arlington ballpark, called The Ballpark, which made the value of
the team shoot through the roof, which made George W. Bush more
money than he ever thought he'd see.
</P>
<P>
   Former Spectrum 7 partner Rea: ``George felt like to get into
politics you needed some personal money, and that was his goal _ to
make enough money where his family would be comfortable and he
wouldn't be beholden to special interests.''
</P>
<P>
   There was quiet talk of running George W. Bush against Richards
in '90 _ Richards went after Dad with that ``poor George'' riff at
the '88 convention, about how Poppy Bush was ``born with a silver
foot in his mouth.'' Oh, people loved that one, didn't they?
Wouldn't it be nice to step up and boot her out of the governor's
office? But George W. didn't run _ told Rea his mother didn't want
him to, for one thing.
</P>
<P>
   The Candidate
</P>
<P>
   When the first son did take on Richards, she let him have it.
Dubya took the jabs and kept smiling. Richards would say Bush was a
failed businessman; Bush would mourn the governor's compulsive use
of ``personal attacks.'' Richards noted Bush had never before held
elected office; Bush wore his inexperience as a badge of honor _
not having to say out loud voters might prefer him to a product of
the Travis County Democratic machine. A Richards spokesman noted
that $141 million for The Ballpark came from a sales tax boost and
city bond guarantees. Bush's flack shot back she was just playing a
``political shell game.'' Jack Morrison says his conduct in the
campaign against Richards showed maturity and clarity of purpose:
``She just savaged him, and he just killed her with kindness.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early going, nobody thought Richards was vulnerable _ she
was a star, maybe could be the first woman president, had big
contributions from Don Henley and Steven Spielberg and Willie.
Who'd Bush have in his corner_ Claytie Williams? But Bush saw
weakness, convinced Texans _ without really coming out and saying
it _ that their governor was maybe not all that nice. Even in the
early going, when he was being painted as the spoiled little
dilettante, he exuded this cockiness, like at a meet-the-staff
event where he first met future speech writer Skardon Baker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm George Bush,'' George Bush says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Skardon Baker,'' Skardon Baker says.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're gonna win, ya know,'' George Bush says.
</P>
<P>
   He made those young aides and volunteers believe. It was so much
fun _ going flat-out all day long, hopping from town to town on the
plane they dubbed Accountability One, writing thank-you cards to
the hosts of the previous stop as soon as it was wheels-up (a
practice learned from George H.W.), cramming for the next event
even as they hit the ground, doing everything literally on the fly.
He had a three-day rule on getting out thank-you notes, and was
adamant about it.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign had juice. ``We had more fun days than not,''
said Israel Hernandez Jr., a campaign aide who also worked for Bush
during his first term as governor.
</P>
<P>
   The weird thing was, you could tell Bush wanted to win _ he's a
competitive guy. But there was a part of him that knew the world
wouldn't end if he lost, and that gave him a certain . . .
fearlessness. Skardon Baker's father recently became a Catholic
priest, and he sees a certain parallel between his father now and
Bush then. Bush, he says, felt a guiding hand on his shoulder,
which lent the campaign a calm core amid the chaos.
</P>
<P>
   He ran every day, wherever they were. If they were in Corpus,
Shoreline Drive. Austin, Town Lake or the UT track. And he called
home from the road every day _ more than ``Hi, how are you, OK,
bye,'' but actual want-to-know-what's-going-on conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez was living in Dallas, of course, as were the Bushes,
and his place got burgled and the next day he had to deal with cops
and whatnot. Candidate Bush found Hernandez and told him: ``You
know, you shouldn't have to worry about things like that. You'd
better come live with us.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, Hernandez recalls, it was like the Waltons at
bedtime:
</P>
<P>
   ``Good night, George.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good night, Laura.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good night, Barb.'' ``Good night, Jenna.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good night, Izzy.''
</P>
<P>
   Richards, meanwhile, having already learned that it was more fun
campaigning for governor than being governor, discovered
campaigning to keep the job was a lot less fun than campaigning to
win it.
</P>
<P>
   The next campaign was little more than a dry run for the Big One
_ W2K. Democrat Garry Mauro ran on a platform of putting ``Texas
Families First.'' Bush didn't need to ask, if family was so
important to Garry, a divorced father, why he couldn't hold his own
family together. Didn't have to say anything like that out loud.
Just watched Mauro sweat through a brutal summer of knocking on
doors as Gov. Bush would fly to events, acting all gubernatorial.
Nothing to it. Kill 'em with kindness.

U.S. SEES PROGRESS IN CASE INVOLVING SLAIN JOURNALIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GARY MARTIN  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The United States believes two Huichol Indians jailed in Mexico
are responsible for the brutal death of an American journalist who
was slain while on a solo backpacking trip in a mountainous region
of western Mexico late last year.
</P>
<P>
   The two suspects, Juan Chivarra de la Cruz and Miguel Hernandez
de la Cruz, had confessed to Mexican officials that they killed
Philip True, 50, the Mexico City correspondent for the San Antonio
Express-News.
</P>
<P>
   The two men later changed their story, twice, and said they
confessed because Mexican soldiers had tortured them.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Davidow, the U.S. ambassador to Mexico, said in San
Antonio on Thursday that the trial of the suspects is moving ahead.
``From what I've seen, the case against them is very strong,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Jalisco state officials and federal administrators in Mexico
have allowed the FBI to review two autopsies of True's body that
produced contradictory results. The FBI also was allowed to inspect
physical evidence and compare witness statements, said Jon
Jennings, acting assistant attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FBI is confident the investigation shows the two
individuals in custody are the persons responsible for the death of
Mr. True,'' Jennings said in a letter to Rep. Charles A. Gonzalez,
D-Texas. ``Moreover, while Mexican prosecutors work to conclude the
investigation, the suspects remain in custody without bail.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez asked Attorney General Janet Reno earlier this year to
press the Mexican government for timely prosecution of the suspects
charged in the death of True. The original autopsy concluded death
by strangulation, while a second examination suggested True died
from a severe blow to the head.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're asking for is a timely resolution,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings, in his letter dated June 11, told Gonzalez the Mexican
Embassy in Washington said the Jalisco prosecutor ``is working
diligently on this case in order to bring about its timely
resolution in the Mexican courts.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, meanwhile, has declined to comment publicly on the
investigation into the death of True, whose body was found Dec. 16,
1998, in a shallow grave in the Sierra Madre.
</P>
<P>
   True left Nov. 29 on a 100-mile trek into the Sierra Madre to
document the life in Huichol villages. He was reported missing by
his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, members of the Inter-American Press
Association met with Jalisco Gov. Alberto Cardenas Jimenez and
state Attorney General Ledesma Martinez. Jorge Fascetto, an
Argentina newspaper editor and president of the IAPA, said Cardenas
was responsive to the association's appeal for justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the opportunity to tell him a satisfactory conviction
of the killers of journalist Philip True would represent a
significant step forward for justice in the state of Jalisco, for
Mexico as a country and for journalists everywhere,'' Fascetto
said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Rivard, editor of the Express-News and an IAPA board
member, said unanswered questions surrounding True's death warrant
continued investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``While we agree there is ample evidence linking the two jailed
suspects with murder, we believe a more complete investigation will
lead to a more satisfactory prosecution and eventual conviction
that people in Mexico and the United States can accept with greater
certainty,'' Rivard said.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Rivard and the IAPA have asked the authorities to
establish a motive in the death. A missing diary discovered earlier
this year suggests True may have had a confrontation with one of
the suspects before his death. The diary details an exchange
between True and a Huichol Indian named Juan, who accused the
journalist of trespassing. The diary, True's camera and a passport
were found with other belongings federal and state officials had
maintained were missing.

   Q: We have a single computer in our house that I share with my
wife and two small children. I have noticed that, when the children
are using the computer, their CD-ROM software doesn't work as well
as it used to. Usually it involves the CD drive stalling out and a
blue screen comes up saying the computer can't read from the CD-ROM
drive. I've installed new drivers, checked the connections, but
nothing seems to work. What could be wrong?
</P>
<P>
   A: What's wrong is probably your children's sticky fingers.
</P>
<P>
   The clue here is the fact that it's happening only with your
children's software, not with your own. If you had driver or
connection problems, all your CD-ROM-based programs would be
affected.
</P>
<P>
   Take a close look at the disks your children use. I suspect
they're dirty and need to be cleaned.
</P>
<P>
   Try cleaning a disk as you would a pair of eyeglasses _ with a
soft tissue, perhaps blowing on it first. If this doesn't work, you
might want to pick up a CD-ROM cleaner at your favorite computer
store.
</P>
<P>
   It's also possible the disks in question are severely scratched.
In that case, you'll need to replace them. Some software publishers
will replace scratched CDs for free if you send them the damaged
ones first. Contact the publisher's technical support line for
details.
</P>
<P>
   Q: There are three computers in our house now, and I am
considering setting up a network so we can play games and share the
modem. I am confused about what to get, though. I see both
10-megabit and 100-megabit home network kits that use Ethernet, and
I see some wireless and phone line kits that only can send with 1
megabit. What are the benefits of the faster kits, given my needs?
</P>
<P>
   A: It depends on whether you value convenience and simplicity
over speed.
</P>
<P>
   Unless your computers are all in the same room, the phone-line
and wireless kits will be much easier to set up and install. For
printing, dial-up modem sharing and most multiplayer games, these
1-megabit systems are just fine.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you will be moving large files back and forth
between computers, or want to run multimedia applications over your
home network, you'll find these non-Ethernet systems to be woefully
inadequate. Moving a 25-megabyte file over a phone-line network can
seem to take forever, while it takes just seconds with 10- or
100-megabit Ethernet. And if you are trying to view video over the
network, you should definitely consider 100-megabit Ethernet.
</P>
<P>
   One other consideration: If you are planning to get cable modem
or high-speed ADSL service, you may want to consider Ethernet. The
average transfer rate for cable-modem service is in the six- to
eight-megabit range, while ADSL can go as high as six megabits
(though residential ADSL service in Houston averages between 384K
and 1.4 megabit). That's faster than the 1-megabit throughput of
the wireless and phone-line networks, making those systems a
bottleneck when you are sharing one of these fast connections.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with Ethernet is that you must string cable between
the computers, and a lot of people aren't comfortable with this
process, which may involve cutting holes in walls and running
wiring through them. But for some folks, the speed is worth the
pain.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I connect to a Web site, I sometimes see a picture of a
lock at the bottom of my browser. What does that mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: It means your browser has made a secure connection to the
site, and is sending and receiving information that's encrypted, or
scrambled. This guarantees a private exchange, and usually is used
for electronic commerce.

OFFICE 2000 SINGS BIG, EXPENSIVE TUNE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there are remaining doubts about whether Microsoft ``gets''
the Internet, they are dashed by the latest version of the software
giant's cash cow, Office 2000. It's the first application suite
that treats the Net as a given.
</P>
<P>
   Office 2000 presumes its users are connected to a network and
presumes they are also connected to the Internet. That's great if
you are _ this is going to be a popular product with big companies
and users who are on the cutting edge of such practices as document
collaboration. But if you don't fit into those categories, Office
2000 is either a dubious upgrade, or a way for users to begin to
explore this advanced way of working.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, I reviewed the competition from Corel, WordPerfect
Office 2000 Professional (See
www.chron.com/content/chronicle/tech/99/06/11/compute.html). While
it's not as Internet-oriented as the Microsoft suite, it costs
quite a bit less and is otherwise as feature-rich as Office 2000.
</P>
<P>
   For this review, I looked at the Premium edition of Office 2000,
which includes Word, a word processor; Excel, a spreadsheet;
PowerPoint, for presentations; Access, a database; Outlook, a
contact manager; FrontPage, a Web site manager; PhotoDraw, an image
editor; and a set of small-business tools.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`BLOATWARE' SLIMS DOWN SOME &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although Microsoft claims it has responded to user complaints
about ``bloatware'' by letting you install only the feature you
think you'll need, this is still a lumbering giant of a package.
The typical installation will drop about 300 megabytes onto your
hard drive. The Premium edition comes on four CDs.
</P>
<P>
   This remains the best-integrated suite _ everything works well
together, and the menus and button bars all follow the same design.
Documents designed by any of these applications can be imported
smoothly into other Office components.
</P>
<P>
   Office 2000's Web integration begins with the most fundamental
aspect _ Hypertext Mark-up Language, the programming language used
for Web pages. In other suites, HTML is treated as a secondary file
format. With the Office components, though, it's a primary format.
</P>
<P>
   This means that if you design a nifty-looking Word document and
save it as HTML, the HTML version will look as good as if you saved
it in Word's own .DOC format. In the past, saving a Word document
as an HTML file was a hit-or-miss proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Office 2000 also lets you save an HTML document directly to a
Web server, whether it's on your corporate network or out there on
the Internet. When you install the suite, it adds an item in the
Windows Explorer called Web Folders. You can save directly to these
folders, just as though they are sitting on your hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a catch. In order for this to work, the server must
be running special software that works with Office. That's too bad
_ Microsoft could have made this a much simpler, more universal and
less proprietary solution if it had used FTP, or File Transfer
Protocol, the standard way to post documents to most Internet
servers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
CUSTOMIZING THE FEATURES &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As with the Corel suite, you can install only those features of
Office 2000 that you need. Then, if you later try to use a feature
that you didn't originally include, the ``Install on Demand''
module either grabs it from a central server on your corporate
network, or prompts you for the CD.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of installation _ the install routine gives you
literally hundreds of choices. If you choose a custom setup, you
can choose to install a feature; install it on first use; or never
allow it to be installed; or to run it from the CD. It's a dizzying
array that can be confusing.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the applications, there very few outward changes in
the programs' interface. (Access, which has had a welcome facelift
to make it more user-friendly, is the biggest exception.) The
button bars and top-level menus will be comfortingly familiar to
longtime Office users. One major difference, though, is in the way
Office hides less-frequently used features, and then brings them
forward if you use them regularly.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you click on Excel's Tools menu, you'll see only
about six selections, including one that says Options. If you click
on Options _ or even if you just sit there for a few seconds _ then
the menu automatically expands to show you more. Wait long enough,
and the Office Assistant (Microsoft's animated help feature)
appears to provide help. If you choose one of the hidden options,
and then use it several times, it will appear each time you select
the Tools.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, there's good news for the many Office users who
consider the irritating Office Assistant characters to be the
business-software equivalent of Jar Jar Binks. You can now access
the Help features without having to look at the stupid things.
</P>
<P>
   One of Office 2000's nicest features is its ability to fix
itself. If you accidentally delete a key file, or if one becomes
corrupted, the Office applications can figure out what's wrong and
will install the missing or broken file automatically.
</P>
<P>
   Pricing for the Premium edition of Microsoft's suite is steep.
The least you can get away with is $449, and that's if you are
upgrading from a previous version or a competitor's product. Even
the lowest-end configuration of Office 2000, dubbed Standard, will
set you back at least $249.

CHERRIES READY FOR PICKING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
( HAS ART)  
By NATALIE HAUGHTON 
 c.  1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If you're dreaming of fresh sweet cherries, the
brief season to take advantage of them has finally arrived. The
start of the season was delayed by two to three weeks this year
because of cold weather in California and the Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   Fresh sweet cherries will be making their way in ever-increasing
numbers into supermarkets and local stores in the next few weeks.
And for those who want to roam the breathtaking array of trees
laden with bright red sweet and tart cherries and pick their own,
U-pick cherry orchards around Southern California will be open
through July 11 or until all the cherries are gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advantage of picking your own is that you get to do your
own quality-control testing,'' said Ken Striplin, president of the
Leona Valley Cherry Growers Association, who anticipates the
availability of plenty of excellent-quality sweet-flavored cherries
even though the crop size has been reduced by 10 percent because of
an April freeze.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest commercial cherry production comes from San Joaquin
County. That crop is in markets now, says Jim Culbertson, executive
manager of the California Cherry Advisory Board in Lodi, whose
group represents 600 growers who produce about 35 percent of the
nation's commercially grown fresh cherry crop.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in peak production now. We started harvesting May 1 _
two weeks later than normal _ and our season will end about July 8
this year,'' he noted. Usually, the California season is finished
before the Northwest growers start shipping cherries to Southern
California markets. However, because of Mother Nature, the two will
overlap slightly this year.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Northwest cherry crop _ from growers in Washington,
Oregon, Utah and Idaho who produce about 65 to 70 percent of the
fresh sweet cherries grown in the United States _ should start
reaching markets June 22, said B.J. Thurlby, national promotion
director, Northwest Cherry Growers, Yakima, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the season's late start, consumers can count on the
availability of plenty of cherries. California growers anticipate a
large crop that may be close to or exceed the 1994 crop, which was
the largest in recent history, added Culbertson.
</P>
<P>
   Also, with the expansion and harvesting of more late-maturing
varieties of cherries at higher elevations, consumers can expect to
find cherries in supermarkets through the second or third week of
August this year, noted Thurlby. Look for the peak of the Northwest
cherry season _ with best product and prices (around $1.49 to $1.89
a pound) _ the second week in July, he advised.
</P>
<P>
   When shopping for cherries, choose plump, sweet cherries with
bright color for the variety. Bing cherries range in color from red
to mahogany or purple-black. Lambert cherries are bright red while
Rainier cherries are yellow-tinged with red. Be aware that once
picked, cherries do not ripen. Keep cherries cold and use within a
few days. Rinse before serving.
</P>
<P>
   To remove cherry pits for recipes, half each cherry and remove
stem and pit or use a cherry pitter available at cookware shops.
</P>
<P>
   Don't limit cherries to out of hand eating. The versatile fruit
makes a good addition to chilled soups, sauces, salads, and baked
and frozen desserts.
</P>
<P>
   Cherries also freeze well. The natural sugar in cherries makes
freezing easy as no processed sweeteners or preservatives are
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   To freeze whole: Rinse cherries (stem intact) quickly in cold
water, drain thoroughly and dry on paper towels. Place cherries in
a zipper-top freezer bag and seal, pressing out as much air as
possible, or use freezer-proof containers. For fastest freezing,
place bags directly on freezer shelves. Leave some space around
each bag until contents are frozen. Once frozen, stack the bags. Be
sure to label and date the cherries. Use within a year.
</P>
<P>
   When ready to use, remove the amount of cherries needed, reseal
the plastic bag and return to the freezer immediately. Eat cherries
right out of the freezer or partially frozen for best flavor and
texture. Keep in mind cherries turn limp and soft if thoroughly
thawed.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the recipes that follow, some additional ways to use
fresh cherries include:
</P>
<P>
   Toss 1 cup pitted and coarsely chopped fresh sweet cherries into
the batter the next time you bake brownies either from scratch or a
mix.
</P>
<P>
   Add cherries to yogurt for a snack.
</P>
<P>
   Use cherries for a pastry filling or bake into cakes, cookies,
quick breads or muffins.
</P>
<P>
   Add cherries to a favorite fruit salad or fruit compote.
</P>
<P>
   Mix pitted cherries with fresh torn-up spinach, cooked crab and
cooked shrimp, and toss with a french, ranch or curried yogurt
dressing for a delicious salad.
</P>
<P>
   Top pitted cherries with yogurt mixed with a little store-bought
lemon or lime curd.
</P>
<P>
   Serve poultry, waffles, pancakes or ice cream topped with cherry
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Stir chopped pitted fresh cherries into pancake or waffle
batter.
</P>
<P>
   Serve fresh pitted cherries topped with creme fraiche or whipped
cream mixed with unsweetened cocoa and powdered sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Stir fresh coarsely chopped pitted cherries into chocolate or
vanilla pudding or tapioca made from scratch or an instant mix.
</P>
<P>
   Top chocolate ice cream with fresh pitted cherries and a jigger
of whiskey or brandy _ or a favorite liqueur.
</P>
<P>
   For brunch, combine a mixture of assorted fresh in-season fruits
including pitted fresh cherries and stir in a little orange juice
concentrate. At serving time, spoon into stemmed wine glasses and
top off with a little lemon-lime carbonated beverage to add an
interesting bubbly effect.
</P>
<P>
   For a special party or dessert, whip up chocolate dipped
cherries. Melt semisweet chocolate chips and a little solid
vegetable shortening in a double boiler over simmering water until
smooth. Remove from heat. Dip fresh rinsed and well-dried cherries,
stems intact (hold by stem), into chocolate then dip bottoms into
chopped almonds. Place on wax apaper-lined tray until set.
</P>
<P>
   Partner fresh cherries with an espresso dip prepared with
instant espresso powder mixed with a little sugar and dissolved in
hot water, then whipped together with whipped cream cheese and a
little vanilla.  &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For a fun outing during the next few weeks, head
to nearby orchards to pick your own cherries.
</P>
<P>
   Following is a list of cherry orchards in the Leona Valley (an
hour's drive from the San Fernando Valley) where you can pick
cherries starting this weekend through the second week of July
(providing the cherries haven't all been picked). Times and days
the orchards are open vary, so call ahead. Most orchards provide
all the equipment needed for picking the fruit, including buckets,
bags and containers.
</P>
<P>
   Prices will vary but will average about $1.50 per pound if you
pick your own (a few orchards also sell already picked cherries).
Also, the minimum amount picked _ and that you're charged for _
varies from orchard to orchard, and in most cases is a pound or
two. Taste-test the cherries right off the trees to find which ones
you like the best. Some orchards offer several cherry varieties.
</P>
<P>
   Leona Valley is in the desert near the mountains and can be very
warm, noted Nessa Ranch manager Ken Striplin, so dress
appropriately. Also it can get very chilly in the late afternoon
and evening, so bring a sweater or light jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Pick plenty of cherries. They'll last about three weeks in the
fridge and are easy to freeze whole with stems attached for a great
snack long after the season is over.
</P>
<P>
   The Leona Valley is 12 miles due west from Palmdale. From the
San Fernando Valley, take the Antelope Valley Freeway (14) north
and exit at Palmdale Boulevard. Go left 12 miles on Palmdale
Boulevard to 90th Street and look for the cherry orchard signs.
</P>
<P>
   If you'd like a brochure pinpointing the specific locations of
the orchards, send a self-addressed stamped envelope to Leona
Valley Cherry Growers Association, P.O. Box 817, Leona Valley,
Calif. 93551-7110.

THE WAVY BORDERLINE BETWEEN FREE SPEECH AND FOUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sun., June 20)  
(jt) 
 By FRANK DeCARO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Timothy Boomer fell out of his canoe into the Rifle River
in Michigan last summer, he did what many men would do _ he swore a
blue streak. Unlike many men, however, he was nailed for it. A
family was within earshot, and Boomer, 25, a computer programmer,
was charged with violating a 102-year-old state law against cursing
in front of women and children.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, after a two-day trial, a jury found him
``guilty of being a potty mouth,'' to quote U.S. News &AMP; World
Report.
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union, which represented the
defendant, has said the statute ``smacks of speech police.'' But
the conviction raises the question: Does public decency outweigh a
man's uncivil rights? It is an emotionally charged issue,
particularly at a time when lawmakers in Washington are calling for
new limits to teen-agers' access to movie and television violence,
including violent language, in the wake of the shootings in
Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The subject, like Boomer's off-color vocabulary, is hard to
avoid.
</P>
<P>
   The world, and particularly our rough-edged corner of it, seems
to be suffering from a mass case of Tourette's syndrome. Foul
language, once the verbal equivalent of hot sauce, is less a
condiment today than a staple in our daily lives. Walk into a CD
megastore to buy, say, an old Peggy Lee reissue, and over the
in-store stereo system you'll very often hear new songs with the
kind of explicit lyrics that require a parental warning label. At a
PG-rated movie, it is not uncommon to hear teen-age ushers using
R-rated language in full voice.
</P>
<P>
   When the soundtrack to the average Jerry Springer show is
bleeped so often that it sounds like a trans-Atlantic call made on
a cheap cell phone, what is left to say on television that hasn't
already been said? There was a time, not that many years ago, when
watching (although not hearing) Cher using a choice word to berate
David Letterman was hilarious. Madonna, chatting with the same
talk-show host, has been known to push the envelope even further.
But even her infamously bleeped antics seem relatively benign
today.
</P>
<P>
   By its sheer ubiquity, such shocking language has lost any
provocative edge it may have had. When, for instance, Chris Rock
used a crude anecdote in his presentation of an American Fashion
Award to Calvin Klein in New York on June 2, it just seemed
inappropriate. Likewise, when Sharon Stone chose an off-color
expression to warn against the dangers of AIDS at the Divas Simply
Singing benefit in Los Angeles on May 8, it just seemed crude.
Neither instance was unexpected. That's the problem.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, when the comedian and legendary ``vulgarian''
Belle Barth talked dirty, it caught audiences off guard. She was a
little old lady with the mouth of a Yiddish-speaking truck driver _
not standard issue in those days _ and she told her audiences, ``If
I embarrass you, tell your friends.'' Her album of that title bore
the words: ``Censored. Not for Air Play. For Adults Only.'' Today,
a half-hour of ``Sex in the City'' on HBO is twice as risque.
Likewise, when Lenny Bruce, Red Foxx or, later, George Carlin
``worked blue,'' as they called it back then, they were breaking
social taboos. Today, there are few barriers of that sort left.
When you can say anything, foul language becomes simply foul,
unless it's used to hilarious effect, which it sometimes is.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, obscenity just seems like yesterday's news.
Although a feature-length version of the animated television series
``South Park'' is set to open this month, there are signs that we
are moving into a post-``South Park'' era. The hit sequel ``Austin
Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' has a naughty word in its title,
but ``shag'' is just that, naughty. The appeal of the film is the
childlike glee of its title character and his nemesis Dr. Evil.
Even in its grossest moments, ``The Spy Who Shagged Me'' possesses
such exuberance that it renders the scatological humor of a
character called Fat Bastard inoffensive. It's not raw, it's just
silly _ so very PG-13, baby.
</P>
<P>
   At Cannes recently, the filmmaker David Lynch stunned the crowd
with his latest picture, ``The Straight Story,'' a fact-based
account of a man who rode his lawn mower from Iowa to Wisconsin to
visit his estranged brother. The shock was that it was G-rated.
Lynch, whose earlier films ``Blue Velvet'' and ``Wild at Heart''
were brutal in both violence and language, has noted in interviews
that a tide of gentleness is overtaking filmmakers of his ilk. Both
the Spanish provocateur Pedro Almodovar and that master of
blue-collar patois David Mamet have chosen to clean up their
vocabularies, at least temporarily. Almodovar's latest film is
``All About My Mother,'' a comedy, and Mamet's ``The Winslow Boy,''
is out now and rated G.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent article in The New York Times, Lynch was quoted as
saying that violence and obscene language on screen ``have been
pushed to an absurd extreme, to the point where you don't feel it
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't really explain it, but I feel a change,'' he added.
``I feel something different in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   If only Boomer had predicted such a shift last summer, he might
not be in such hot water today.

A GIFT FOR THE FATHER OF INVENTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., June 20) 
(jt) 
 By ELIZABETH HAYT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To the innocent eye, my father seems a mild-mannered radiologist
and suburban grandfather. By day, in his silver-rim glasses,
wearing a lab coat with a calculator in the breast pocket, he looks
like the kind of guy who would kick back with Scientific American.
</P>
<P>
   But Dad is really a cross between Bob Vila, the home improvement
guru, and Dr. Victor Frankenstein. Throughout my childhood he spent
late nights building who-knows-what in a basement workshop that
smelled of sawdust and was filled with menacing-looking machinery
from the 1940s. Twenty years ago, he created a system, operated by
timers, that alternately watered and fertilized the lawn, long
before such devices came on the market.
</P>
<P>
   Although it was a success, just as often his mad-scientist
creations have been riddled with glitches. To run the heating and
air-conditioning in his present house, he wired the systems to his
phone lines. Now, he can turn on the cool air away from home by
dialing a number from his cell phone. But the phones in the house
are so staticky that it is nearly impossible to hear voices above
the crackle.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to get out of the rut of Father's Day gifts I buy every
year from Brooks Brothers or Barnes &AMP; Noble, I set out to find
something this year that appealed to his love of tinkering. The
perfect gift, I suspected, awaited in one of the gizmo-stocked
stores of 57th Street: Hammacher Schlemmer, the Sharper Image,
Brookstone.
</P>
<P>
   I am baffled by technospeak, the language of all the men in my
family, and so I enlisted my two brothers to go with me. Michael, a
neuroradiologist, and Paul, a lawyer, are both married with
children and have inherited the paternal fiddling gene.
</P>
<P>
   Our first stop was Hammacher Schlemmer, famous for kitchen
knives and novelty tools and, nowadays, high-tech eccentricities. I
knew my father would have no use for a backyard driving range.
Ditto the nail clippers in a leather case, which would lie idle in
the medicine cabinet, since Dad's idea of a manicure is a hand
degreaser called Goop and a roll of paper towels.
</P>
<P>
   Just as my brothers and I were about to leave, a high-pressure
washing tool for $219.95 caught my eye. It was powered by an
electric pump and had a hose attached to a long nozzle, which
looked like a machine gun. I could see my father standing hand on
hip, happily spray-cleaning grime off the patio furniture.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many gallons per minute?'' Michael inquired.
</P>
<P>
   ``One point six gallons per minute,'' said Paul, looking the
machine over.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's nothing,'' Michael sniffed. ``You need 3.2 GPM or
you're not talking clean. You've got to be able to blast the paint
off your car to get it clean. Plus, it's too expensive. Dad likes
cheap Chinese tools from the Price Club.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheap and turbocharged, that's the kind of stuff that appeals to
Dad, all right. In fact, if it means saving money, no
home-improvement scheme is too ambitious for him. During a
hurricane a few years ago, a tree trunk weighing more than a ton
fell on top of his house. Rather than hire a tree surgeon to remove
it, he rented a hydraulic log splitter. Dressed in a hard hat, he
ordered my brothers to hoist the tree with pulleys and ropes and
then to cut it up with a chainsaw. He stockpiled a lot of firewood
that year.
</P>
<P>
   Leaving Hammacher Schlemmer, we headed to the Sharper Image,
where right away Paul spied the Turbo-Groomer, an electric
nose-hair trimmer. ``This, Dad could use,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, for his ears, too,'' Michael said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although he would probably tell you about the biological
virtues of nose hairs as a filter,'' Paul added.
</P>
<P>
   Michael said, ``He'd wind up using it on stray threads on the
car seats.''
</P>
<P>
   It's true. Dad can't resist inventing new uses for tools and
other gear, like the time he adapted the cruise control from his
car to fit his Suzuki motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   Making our way around the store, my brothers and I stopped
before a white-noise machine meant to drown out background sounds
while sleeping. It brought back memories. Dad once installed
speakers in a pillow to study for his nuclear-medicine boards,
playing an endless recording of notes while he slept. He passed the
exam on the first go.
</P>
<P>
   His faith in sleep-teaching was of long standing. It was
instilled the year before I was born, after he read an article
maintaining that the best learning took place during slumber. For
my parents' honeymoon in 1960, Dad recited a textbook aloud into a
tape recorder, and though he had no trouble sleeping with the
cassette player under his pillow, my mother was kept awake night
after night listening to medical mumbo jumbo.
</P>
<P>
   Next to the white-noise machine was a self-cleaning kitty litter
box.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not as good as Dad's,'' Michael said. ``Paul, remember when
you had a cat and lived in a studio apartment, and Dad built an
enclosed litter box? He figured out a system where the cat got in
the box and tripped a pressure-weighted switch that triggered an
exhaust fan inside, and the smell was sucked out through a
ventilator duct in the bathroom.''
</P>
<P>
   As Paul and I nodded at the memory, Michael wondered aloud about
the psychology behind our father's impulse to invent and redesign.
``It's an admission of a lack of masculinity if you hire someone
else to do a job for you,'' he said. ``The more you can create,
build and fix, the more manly you are. This is the essence of being
a Hayt.''
</P>
<P>
   No wonder I felt left out growing up.
</P>
<P>
   A few doors down from the Sharper Image, at Brookstone, Michael
was immediately drawn to a set of retractable barbecue tools. Dad
would love the idea of detaching a spatula from its handle for
cleaning, he said. But Paul was sure the wood components, which
were not dishwasher-safe, would prove frustrating.
</P>
<P>
   Considering this, Michael agreed. ``Dad likes to be able to put
everything in the dishwasher _ soap dishes, toothbrushes, combs,''
he said. Turning to Paul, he asked: ``Did he ever put automotive
parts in there? I know he's big on using kerosene and gasoline for
cleaning grease.''
</P>
<P>
   As my brothers mulled this over, I drifted to the back of the
store, where I found a simple white box with buttons and numbers in
a digital display. It looked like an alarm clock, but it was
actually an indoor-outdoor thermometer with an electronic memory.
It cost $30. Waving over my brothers, I asked hesitantly: ``What
about this? Couldn't Dad figure out something to use this for?''
</P>
<P>
   Michael studied the device. ``Dad would like that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Paul pointed out that Dad already has remote control over the
air-conditioning in the house (that jury-rigged phone system) and
that he likes to have it cool when he walks in the door. ``This
thing would provide him with information,'' he said. ``It would
allow him to know the temperature of the house without being in it.
He would know if his pipes will burst in the winter, and if his
system is working in the summer.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul's advice was, ``Buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaving the store with my package, I felt a gift-buying
satisfaction I had rarely known before. My Father's Day purchase
would help me connect with the man so often hidden behind a gaggle
of wires, a cloud of metal shavings or the hood of a car. When I
call him up, our voices rising over the static, now I'll have an
instant conversation opener.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, Dad,'' I'll say, ``what were the highs and lows today?''

   I'm thinking about this because of the TNT movie ``Pirates of
Silicon Valley,'' which will be shown three times Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Starring Noah Wyle as Steve Jobs and Anthony Michael Hall as
Bill Gates, it's the story of college kids who played with machines
in boxes, then worked, cajoled, borrowed and stole their way to
enormous wealth.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen how they'll log off into the sunset.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is written and directed by Martyn Burke (``Pentagon
Wars''). The source material is the book ``Fire in the Valley,'' by
Paul Freiberger and Michael Swaine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pirates of Silicon Valley'' isn't as funny or barbed as its
creators seem to think it is. But it's still one of TNT's more
ambitious efforts, and it's never less than entertaining.
</P>
<P>
   It's surprisingly tough on its star marauders, too, especially
Jobs, the visionary who founded Apple Computer with Steve Wozniak
(Joey Slotnick).
</P>
<P>
   Wyle is easily the film's strongest presence as a charismatic
figure with an almost mystical belief in what he and computers can
accomplish. ``This ain't just business,'' Jobs declares. ``This is
practically spiritual. This is about overthrowing dead culture.''
</P>
<P>
   He first tears through countercultural rituals, including a
fling with Hare Krishna and an affinity for LSD, and then turns
into a megalomaniacal brute when Apple catches fire in the late
1970s.
</P>
<P>
   By now he's screaming at employees, bullying job applicants and
even alienating Wozniak. He's also seen denying that he's the
father of his girlfriend's (Gema Zamprogna) daughter, though as
Wozniak reminds him, a paternity test has pretty much nailed him.
</P>
<P>
   I can't vouch for the accuracy of all this. It is distressing,
though, to see the movie pairing Jobs and Wozniak as buddies at UC
Berkeley in 1971, and then read a TNT chronology prepared for
reviewers saying the two met at Hewlett-Packard in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   On to Gates. Hall seems more intimidated by the thought of
playing the world's wealthiest man. His performance is stilted and
lacks the fluidity of Wyle's, though it never crashes all the way
to robotic impersonation.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft founder is depicted as a struggling wannabe who
lives on pizza and bluff, who speaks the language of money as well
as the language of computer operating systems, and who swipes the
keys to  &LR;   &LR; Windows from Jobs' Macintosh prototypes.
</P>
<P>
   There's an undeniable thrill in seeing Gates, as a Harvard nerd,
trying to focus his attention on a Boston strip show. Or racing
bulldozers in Albuquerque, the first home of Microsoft. Or
schlepping around a roller-skating rink, trying unsuccessfully to
snag a date.
</P>
<P>
   Burke seems to want the movie to be the sort of frolic that
``Barbarians at the Gate'' was a few years ago on HBO.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pirates of Silicon Valley'' can't touch that octave, but he's
delivered a diverting adventure about gunmen riding the high
plateau of sophisticated technology.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if only TNT would tackle ``The Brigands of Broadcasting,''
in which the daring Ted Turner wages corporate warfare with the
wily Rupert Murdoch.
</P>
<P>
   It could be the second in a series of exciting movies about
fearless desperados ambushing each other in the bushy landscape of
merging technologies, skyrocketing stock options and lax government
vigilance.
</P>
<P>
   Podner, it's enough to make any real American's hair stand on
end.

 &HT;    QUAKE WOUNDS SOUL OF COLONIAL MEXICAN CITY
 &HT;    With Photos.

<P>
   PUEBLA, Mexico _ The Spanish painted tiles, Moorish arabesques
and stone sculptures that grace the ancient buildings in this
colonial city are its pride and soul.
</P>
<P>
   And right now people in Puebla are in mourning, fearing that a
6.7 earthquake that struck Mexico Tuesday may have dealt their
heritage a mortal blow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our history has been wiped out,'' said Juan Carlos Castillo,
who stopped with his 5-year-old son outside a 16th-century church
whose bell tower was shredded by the quake, which also killed at
least 23 people in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Architects hope Castillo's prediction is premature and that
careful recontracting -- and millions of dollars -- will save the
majority of Puebla's architectural jewels. This city about 70 miles
southeast of the capital Mexico City is, in fact, so blessed by
buildings of historical and architectural value that it is an
official United Nations cultural landmark.
</P>
<P>
   The death of these 16th- and 17th-century structures with unique
Mexican baroque designs would be like the United States losing New
Orleans' French Quarter or Virginia's Williamsburg. Puebla has a
total of at least 2,600 structures considered colonial treasures or
artistic gems from the 19th and early 20th centuries.
</P>
<P>
   In Puebla's colonial center, initial estimates are that the
quake damaged 33 historic churches, 32 public buildings and six
Autonomous University of Puebla structures. Nineteen buildings,
including the Company of Jesus Church -- built by Jesuits in 1690
-- are considered severely damaged. As many as 300 churches may
have been damaged throughout the entire state of Puebla, whose
capital city was founded in 1531.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not believe at this point that there are any historic
buildings that will have to be completely abandoned,'' said Sergio
Arturo Vergara of Mexico's National Historical and Anthropological
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday Vergara toured the inside of the badly cracked
Company of Jesus Church and a building that is now the central
structure of the Autonomous University of Puebla.
</P>
<P>
   Vergara urged residents not to panic, and said that if Mexico
can earmark government funds and raise money from private sources
and the United Nations many of Puebla's buildings can be at least
partially preserved. Carefully chosen architects with experience in
repairing earthquake damage will have to be enlisted to take apart
damaged sections of buildings and then reconstruct them using some
of the same stones and bricks they were built with centuries ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the teams of experts surveying the damage all agree that
cash-strapped Mexico will need a monumental effort to raise the
funds necessary for such a massive restoration project.
</P>
<P>
   As Vergara and other architects walked the scarred halls of the
400-year-old university building Thursday, the structure moaned and
shuddered occasionally, reminding those inside that it was still
dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican soldiers and university employees scurried about,
packing files and carting off debris. The structure is standing,
but large cracks run the entire length of some of its halls, which
are as long as half a city block.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of cupolas that form the ceilings of each hall are cut in
half by huge cracks that expose ancient brick masonry beneath
delicate facades.
</P>
<P>
   Vergara said Puebla's San Agustin Church, whose original
structure dates back to the late 1500's, may fare better than many
Puebla residents initially thought.
</P>
<P>
   Rubble from a collapsed bell tower is primarily material that
was added as late as the 19th century, he said. Much of the the
original tower survived.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds gathered around the San Agustin Church, taking pictures
and wondering what will become of the glistening gold altar and
colonial paintings inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would feel even worse if it it had been a bomb or
something other than a natural disaster that harmed it,'' said
Francisco Reyes, who grew up in Puebla. ``But you can't help but
feel bad. It's like losing a part of oneself.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations recognized Puebla as one of the world's
cultural landmarks ``not just because of the importance it has for
people here, but for humanity. These buildings were outstanding
examples of architecture in their time,'' said Enrique Loyala
Grageda, a Puebla civil engineer and a member of the U.N.
Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization's International
Council of Monuments and Sites in Puebla.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts believe Puebla's colonial buildings might have
fared better if they had received more intensive maintenance over
the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The historic center needs constant attention to avoid
deterioration,'' Loyala Grageda said. ``And it should start getting
that from now on.''

 &HT;    YELTSIN TO ATTEND SUMMIT AS RUSSIA'S WOES PERSIST
 &HT;    With G8-KOSOVO-0619; CLINTON-G8;-0619.
 &HT;    By CHARLES W. HOLMES 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ If the Group of Eight industrialized nations were a
country club, Russia would be like the annoying member who cannot
afford to pay the dues, but dominates the debate during the club
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Turbulent relations between Russia and the world's seven richest
nations threaten to overshadow the three-day summit of the G-8,
which opened Friday in Cologne, Germany.
</P>
<P>
   The future of war-tattered Kosovo, and Russia's newly defined
role in the international peacekeeping effort there, promises to
dominate the agenda this weekend. Russia's ongoing economic
problems and its efforts to secure a Western bailout are also
central to the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and Russian officials ended a weeklong impasse at meetings
in Helsinki, Finland, on Friday reaching and agreement on how
Russian troops will fit into the NATO-led peacekeeping force now in
the Kosovo province.
</P>
<P>
   The accord was reached just two days before President Clinton
and Russian President Boris Yeltsin were scheduled to meet at an
economic summit in Cologne, Germany. Yeltsin had said earlier
Friday that he expected the issue to be resolved during a meeting
between himself and Clinton scheduled for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   An agreement on the peacekeeping plan is important for the
summit, which is focusing on ways to return more than 1 million
ethnic Albanian refugees to their homes and how to pay for
rebuilding of the war-ravaged province.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's rapid move of troops into Kosovo ahead of NATO forces
last weekend raised questions of Yeltsin's grip on power and
Russia's intentions towards the West. Russian forces took control
of the airport near Pristina and used the armored vehicles to bar
the entrance of British and French troops.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin himself will be the center of attention Sunday when he
arrives for the ceremonies closing the summit and to hold talks
with Clinton and German Chancellor Gerhardt Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian president, 68 and in chronically poor health since
heart bypass surgery in 1996, has not held face-to-face talks with
Clinton in 10 months, though the two have been in frequent
telephone contact since the Kosovo war begin in late March. Yeltsin
reportedly has limited periods when he is lucid and has spent much
of the past year out of sight, convalescing from a variety of
illnesses and fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's newly appointed prime minister, Sergei Stepashin, is
attending the working sessions of the summit on Friday and
Saturday. Stepashin, 47, is a former interior minister who was
promoted in May to prime minister in Yeltsin's third government
overhaul in 14 months. He does not have a strong background in
foreign policy, unlike his predecessor Yevgeny Primakov who had
also served as Yeltsin's foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he will seek to convince the other G-8 members
that Russia is addressing its economic problems and deserves
further international aid and loans.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin had not planned to attend the summit, according to
reports in the Russian media. But he changed his mind after
Russia's bold troop movement into Kosovo, a ploy designed to give
Russia a greater role in determining the future of the Balkans
province.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeltsin becomes more active every time there is the 'smell' of
victory in the air, no matter whether it is big or small,'' wrote
the Nezavisimaya Gazeta newspaper on Friday. The real purpose for
his visit to the summit after his long illness is ``to appear as
the real and not the phantom leader of the country,'' the editorial
said.
</P>
<P>
   One year ago, the G-7 became the G-8, as Russia was added to the
exclusive club of the world's wealthiest industrialized nations in
an effort to boost its participation and prestige following the
collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia's economy collapsed last August, prompting Western
nations to halt further aid and loans backed by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) because of concerns about the way Russian
officials had squandered previous assistance.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. air campaign against Iraq in December and the NATO war
against Yugoslavia this spring drove a further wedge between Russia
and the West as Yeltsin's health worsened and Russia's political
stability seemed less certain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question that Yeltsin remains the key powerbroker
in Russia. The question is whether he can wield the power and to
what end,'' said a Western diplomat in Moscow, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's economic situation is a separate agenda item for
meetings in Cologne on Saturday. At the least, Russian officials
hope to win an endorsement from the other members for further IMF
assistance, even though Russia's Communist-dominated parliament on
Thursday rejected a tax package thought to be a prerequisite to
further aid.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's handlers apparently hope to limit his public exposure
during his quick visit to Cologne on Sunday. No press conference
has been planned and Yeltsin will fly back to Moscow Sunday
evening. It will be Yeltsin's first trip outside Russia since he
attended the funeral of King Hussein of Jordan in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``World leaders are going to discuss the main political issue
(Kosovo) without Yeltsin, and he won't be there to take part in the
main economic problem -- of how to overcome the disparity between
the richest and poorest regions of the world on the eve of the 21st
century,'' the Kommersant Daily, a Russian business newspapers,
said Friday in a critical editorial.

 &HT;    SUCCESS OF KOSOVO HAS CLINTON TAKING BOWS ON WORLD STAGE
 &HT;    850&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    With G8-KOSOVO-0619; RUSSIA-G8-0619.

<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOGNE, Germany _ Buoyed by his leadership of NATO's qualified
success in Kosovo, the strongest American economy in a generation
and the fading echoes of his impeachment travails, President
Clinton is projecting an air of fresh authority at the annual
summit of seven of the world's most powerful heads of state.
</P>
<P>
   Walking tall among his counterparts in this 2,000-year-old city
of towering spires and soaring ambitions, Clinton appeared
comfortably in control of the agenda Friday, as the G-7 leaders
opened a weekend of talks on issues ranging from Balkans
reconstruction to debt relief for developing countries.
</P>
<P>
   He drew accolades from his fellow heads of state for his role in
leading his NATO partners in the coalition air war against
Yugoslavia's bloody repression in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to thank President Clinton for his leadership and
for his courage and his support,'' British Prime Minister Tony
Blair told Clinton, who looked on beaming in a dark grey suit and a
brilliant yellow tie. ``Without your leadership, and without the
American people's support, we simply couldn't have brought this to
a successful conclusion.''
</P>
<P>
   He's even established himself as the senior mentor to two
fast-rising stars in the American political firmament -- his vice
president, Al Gore, the leading Democratic contender for the 2000
presidential race; and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, exploring
the prospect of running for the U.S. Senate. Both are leaning
heavily on the legacy of a man analysts expected them to distance
themselves from just a few months ago.
</P>
<P>
   It's all a far cry from where Clinton stood at last summer's
Group of Seven summit in Blair's native land, where Clinton was
dogged by an ugly scandal that threatened his presidency and
shadowed his official travels around the world.
</P>
<P>
   It was only six months ago, after all, on the eve of his Dec.
19th impeachment by the House, that Clinton was pelted with so many
scandal-related questions at a Jerusalem press conference that his
host, then Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, was forced to plead
with reporters for a query on the state of Mideast peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's response to that atmosphere was to avoid the media as
much as possible.
</P>
<P>
   That was then; this is now.
</P>
<P>
   As he moved with assurance from one press event to the other
Friday in this hub of commerce and culture on the banks of the
Rhine River, Clinton appeared to revel in his renewed relationship
with a press corps more focused on substance than scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly overriding his handlers, Clinton insisted on taking
multiple questions during the sort of routine photo ops that,
during months of impeachment maneuvering, had once showcased
Clinton's frosty relationship with a press corps fixed on the
details of the Monica Lewinsky scandal and frustrated with White
House stonewalling on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   He even stunned a handful of reporters and photographers by
inviting them to join him Thursday night for a dinner of
sauerbraten, apple sauce and dumplings at a Cologne restaurant,
where he chatted into the night -- off the record -- about movies,
novels, food and current events.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president's eager to talk about the issues and to meet
with the press,'' said presidential assistant Sidney Blumenthal.
``He reflects that privately as well as publicly.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the fading emphasis on impeachment -- Clinton was
acquitted in the Senate on Feb. 12 -- the president is riding the
crest of one of the greatest peace time economic expansions in the
nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   With unemployment, inflation and interest rates at or near
generational lows and job creation, home ownership and family
wealth at or near all-time highs, the American economy is the envy
of the industrialized world. On Friday, Clinton found himself asked
by a Japanese reporter whether he saw Japan's recent growth surge
-- after nearly a decade of weakness -- as an endorsement of Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi's economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's response -- ``It's very good news'' -- meant less than
the question. When Clinton first took office it was more common for
Japanese officials to lecture their American counterparts on
economic policy than to seek their approval of Tokyo's ways.
</P>
<P>
   By far the biggest factor in Clinton's enhanced stature on the
global stage, though, has been the perception that his leadership
was both unique and essential to holding together the 19-nation
NATO alliance during its 78-day air war against Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
   As the leaders of the G-7 countries -- the United States,
Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan -- gathered here
Friday, Clinton announced the latest encouraging statistics behind
NATO's Kosovo operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should all just take a moment to reflect,'' on that
operation, Clinton said, noting that 35,000 Serb forces -- out of a
total of 40,000 -- had vacated the province of Kosovo, as 19,000
NATO peacekeeping troops had poured in, during the week since NATO
air strikes forced a Serb surrender.
</P>
<P>
   ``The three things that we've fought for,'' Clinton said, citing
refugee returns, the NATO peacekeeping force and the exit of Serb
forces from Kosovo, ``are being achieved.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Victory in Kosovo doesn't appear to have notably boosted
Clinton's popularity at home. Only 55 percent of Americans approve
of the way he's doing his job -- with 35 percent disapproving --
according to a poll of 1,153 American adults taken by the Pew
Research Center for the People and the Press between June 9-13.
</P>
<P>
   That's the lowest Clinton's job approval rating has been since
last September, weeks after he went on national television to say
he had intentionally deceived the nation over the nature of his
relationship with Lewinsky, the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   One possible explanation is that the triumph in Kosovo has been
tempered by the humanitarian tragedy in a province where an
estimated 10,000 ethnic Albanians were slaughtered by Serb troops,
police and paramilitary gangs, who forced more than a million
others to flee their homes over the course of the NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't possible to reverse those horrors, even if Clinton
claims to have led NATO in punishing the perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
   As a way to burnish his image as the twice-elected, and still
very much standing, leader of the last remaining superpower on
Earth, opening the G-7 summit with the news out of Kosovo could
scarcely have been better scripted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There couldn't be any better testament to the new spirt there
is in the world,'' said Blair, ``than the fact that we were
prepared to stand up for the values of civilization and justice as
we approach the 21st Century.''

   Mexican soldiers and university employees scurried about,
packing files and carting off debris. The structure is standing,
but large cracks run the entire length of some of its halls, which
are as long as half a city block.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of cupolas that form the ceilings of each hall are cut in
half by huge cracks that expose ancient brick masonry beneath
delicate facades.
</P>
<P>
   Vergara said Puebla's San Agustin Church, whose original
structure dates back to the late 1500's, may fare better than many
Puebla residents initially thought.
</P>
<P>
   Rubble from a collapsed bell tower is primarily material that
was added as late as the 19th century, he said. Much of the the
original tower survived.
</P>
<P>
   Crowds gathered around the San Agustin Church, taking pictures
and wondering what will become of the glistening gold altar and
colonial paintings inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would feel even worse if it it had been a bomb or
something other than a natural disaster that harmed it,'' said
Francisco Reyes, who grew up in Puebla. ``But you can't help but
feel bad. It's like losing a part of oneself.''
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations recognized Puebla as one of the world's
cultural landmarks ``not just because of the importance it has for
people here, but for humanity. These buildings were outstanding
examples of architecture in their time,'' said Enrique Loyala
Grageda, a Puebla civil engineer and a member of the U.N.
Education, Scientific and Cultural Organization's International
Council of Monuments and Sites in Puebla.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts believe Puebla's colonial buildings might have
fared better if they had received more intensive maintenance over
the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The historic center needs constant attention to avoid
deterioration,'' Loyala Grageda said. ``And it should start getting
that from now on.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``You know what they should call us?'' asked Freddy
Roman. ``Funny comedians. Not Borscht Belt comedians.''
</P>
<P>
   Noisy agreement erupted from around the dinner. Mal Z. Lawrence,
Stewie Stone, Adrienne Tolsch and Dick Capri had finished a
performance a couple of weeks ago at the 92d Street Y, a panel
entitled ``Borscht Belt Confidential.'' All of them said they were
happy to be invited to participate in an evening devoted to
Catksills comedy. They just weren't crazy about the title. ``It's
demeaning!'' boomed Capri, in a voice that did not sound easily
demeaned.
</P>
<P>
   There was no cabbage-based cuisine on the menu at Joanna's, a
little Italian place a few blocks from the Y where this vociferous
group had gathered, but several courses of shtick were served.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like a table near the food,'' said Stone on the way in,
echoing Henny Youngman's standard line on entering the Friars Club
dining room: ``Gimme a table near a waiter.''
</P>
<P>
   Until after midnight, these veterans of the sable circuit told
stories, interrupted and one-upped each other in a scene straight
out of ``Broadway Danny Rose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Too goyish!'' Ms. Tolsch said, when the waiter offered
monkfish. Capri wondered, ``What's a classic Caesar?''The elegant
Lawrence explained: ``After you eat it, they stab you six times.''
</P>
<P>
   The jokes were older than Jeffrey Ross, the kid at the table and
host of the Y event. But he didn't seem to mind. Ross, 33, is also
a stand-up comic and writer. His resume has all the right names on
it (Jay Leno, Conan O'Brien) and the usual clubs (the Comedy
Cellar, Luna Lounge), except for one: the Friars Club, an
institution that used to be considered a retirement home for
has-beens.
</P>
<P>
   When Ross first started playing poker and eating tuna fish
sandwiches at the Friars with men old enough to be his grandfather,
``it was the uncoolest thing I could do,'' he recalled. But his
downtown credibility and industry connections helped make cool
again a style of comedy his peers had written off as beyond corny.
</P>
<P>
   Janeane Garofalo is a Friar now. Last October, Comedy Central's
broadcast of the Friars' Drew Carey roast scored some of the
highest ratings in the cable channel. Buddy Hackett, who got a
standing ovation at the 92d Street Y for telling an ancient
Catskills joke from his seat in the audience, is in the cast of a
biting sitcom called ``Action'' on the Fox network's fall line-up.
</P>
<P>
   With an apprentice's inquisitive awe, Ross asked, ``How did you
guys do late-night shows, then go to work at 9 the next day?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten thirty!'' corrected Stone, 59, who started his comedy
career in the Catskills as a social director at the Concord hotel
(sold last year to Sheraton franchisers), leading groups of
vacationers through their morning rounds of Simon Says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naps were very important,'' added Roman, who is the dean, or
president, of the Friars Club. He started out, at 14, as a busboy
at a small hotel owned by his uncle. At 16, he made emcee,
``because my uncle was cheap,'' he sid. The big act in the
mountains that year (1955): Stubby Kaye, who sang and danced with
Frank Sinatra in ``Guys and Dolls.''
</P>
<P>
   Capri felt compelled to interject: ``I opened for Sinatra.
Twice. Never met him.'' The Chairman, he explained, did not like to
waste time with opening acts _ or at all. Once, in Rome, he said,
Sinatra found himself stuck in traffic en route to a show at the
Coliseum: ``He says to the driver, `Couldn't they move it closer to
the hotel?' True story.''
</P>
<P>
   Many anecdotes from the old days involved long-forgotten
bunaglow colonies and tummlers _ Yiddish for the house jesters
hired to keep guests perpetually amused. The name of Myron Cohen, a
Catskills giant, was invoked with reverence. ``A wonderful human
being,'' Roman called him. ``A delicious, wonderful man.''
</P>
<P>
   These stories were often introduced with the prologue ``I must
tell you, in all seriousness . . .'' and concluded, with a hand to
the heart, ``True story.''
</P>
<P>
   Who didn't play the Catskills? The random roster of
show-business names dropped around the table include Sid Caesar,
Danny Kaye, Jerry Lewis, Dick Shawn and Arsenio Hall, who ``died a
horrible death,'' Roman said. He consoled the young Hall in a
coffeeshop afterward: ``I told him, `Up here, if you don't die
first, you ain't gonna live.''' Years later, Roman remembered, Hall
repayed the favor telling a guest not to put down the Catskills and
fondly recalling the name of Freddy Roman.
</P>
<P>
   A little respect is all they're asking, forroutines honed over
half-a-century, in some very tough rooms. ``Audiences never paid in
the Catskills,'' Capri said. ``You had to bang 'em, or they'd get
up and walk! You had to let 'em know where the punchline is.
Subtlety? Humor? Forget humor!''
</P>
<P>
   There was a certain amount of gallows humor, though, on the
subject of lagging careers and intermittent bookings, most of which
are now in Atlantic City or Florida. Stone described his last tour
as ``20 condos in 20 days.'' Many joked that the 92d Street Y was
the best gig they could get. But the mostly gray-haired audience
was their willing captive. Capri killed with the line, ``If a
Jewish man is alone in a forest, and he's talking, is he still
wrong?''
</P>
<P>
   Italian by descent, Capri is Jewish by association. How could he
not be? Catskills comedy is almost by definition Jewish. Lawrence,
who had a cameo in the recent film ``A Walk on the Moon,'' recalled
a stint on the road with Buck Owens and the Buckaroos. ``I said,
`Buck, how come you picked me?' Buck says, `I told 'em I wanted a
fast-talkin' Jew comic and I got you.'''
</P>
<P>
   They are an easy mark, these Runyonesque characters with their
pocket squares, broad delivery and mobster machismo. The Borscht
Belt has been replaced by the Sansabelt. In almost every way, this
group represents everything the younger generation of
``alternative'' stand-up comics set out to rebel against.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Ross said, ``if I can make Dick and Freddy and Buddy
Hackett laugh in conversation, that is a feather in my cap.''
</P>
<P>
   As the dinner broke up, the young Friar put on a baggy white
cardigan that Hackett had given him earlier that evening, was
kissed on the cheek by Roman, and headed back downtown.
</P>
<P>
   True story.

   FOUR-SEASONS (New York) _ Designed by Philip Johnson, who is
still given a daily corner booth, the Four Seasons restaurant
opened on July 21, 1959, with a $4.5 million price tag _ in 1959
dollars _ that shocked even jaded New Yorkers. Forty years later,
the Four Seasons thrives. Its singular role in the life of New York

   PUBLIC-CURSING (Undated) _ The world, and particularly our
rough-edged corner of it, seems to be suffering from a mass case of
Tourette's syndrome. Foul language, once the verbal equivalent of
hot sauce, is less a condiment today than a staple in our daily
lives. Walk into a CD megastore to buy, say, an old Peggy Lee
reissue, and over the in-store stereo system you'll very often hear
new songs with the kind of explicit lyrics that require a parental

 &HT;    A father's lessons, values and humor live on in his grandson
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Ana Pecina Walker
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ Some of the most powerful people I know are
some of the quietest.
</P>
<P>
   You have met them. They walk in a room almost unnoticed, yet
their presence immediately commands attention.
</P>
<P>
   People lean forward to catch their every word because these
quiet individuals rarely raise their voices but they always have
something worthwhile to say.
</P>
<P>
   My dad is one of those people. He is the stereotypical man of
few words but he is one of the greatest communicators I know. His
teaching is almost
</P>
<P>
   always by example, rarely by lecture.
</P>
<P>
   He can tell a joke as well as anyone but never sets out to do
so. His ``stories'' fit the context of whatever conversation he
happens to be partaking in. He is not a boaster or a braggart but
when he clears his throat, the room falls silent. We all want to
know what he is going to say. Reflections on this Father's Day,
however, led me straight to my son.
</P>
<P>
   At 13, he has provided me with a view of some of his
grandfather's characteristics. It happens in small, seemingly
inconsequential ways. Recently, I was working in the kitchen and
listening to some of that loud rock music from my teen years and my
son walked through the room. Barely above a whisper, he commented,
``All those songs sound the same.''
</P>
<P>
   As I laughed at the reversal of roles, I was struck by sense of
deja vu. I remembered sitting in my parents' living room with my
younger sisters some
</P>
<P>
   30 years ago listening to that very same band. My dad's quiet
remark back then: ``sounds like somebody working on a car.''
</P>
<P>
   My father is fast approaching his 85th birthday as a fairly
healthy man. Still, time is becoming more precious.
</P>
<P>
   As I go about not only asking questions about his past and
gleaning as muchknowledge as I can from him, I also have undertaken
the task of telling him about the many things I have learned from
him.
</P>
<P>
   And as I watch my son grow up, I know that even after my father
is gone, I'll still have his lessons, his humor, his values _ and
the company of a
</P>
<P>
   young man who is very much like him.

<P>
   Q: I have a dog that is unusual-looking _ everyone says he
should be on a calendar. Where does a person get in touch with a
dog agent?
</P>
<P>
   _ J.K., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: One Fort Worth-Dallas company that is looking for dogs, birds
and more-exotic creatures is Animal Trackers at Box 4313, Dallas
75208.
</P>
<P>
   Company owner David Parr said you should send four 35mm
photographs of your animal and a sheet of paper that lists your
name, address, phone number and the commands your dog knows.
</P>
<P>
   ```Sit' is 90 percent of photo work, and `come' is 50 percent of
all commercial work,'' Parr said. He isn't looking for any cats,
regardless of talent. ``They are just so finicky, and there's so
much odd noise _ building sets and other things _ that it scares
them.''
</P>
<P>
   In other areas, the best place to find an animal agent is
through a local or state film commission, said Barbara O'Brien, who
calls herself ``top dog'' of the Animal Connection agency in
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien will look at snapshots of animals sent to Animal
Connection, 233 W. Poplar St. W., South St. Paul, MN 55075 _
``especially if they have something really unusual,'' she said. Put
your name, address and phone number on the back of each picture you
send.
</P>
<P>
   Animal Connection has a Web site at www.animal-connection.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: A Tony Danza commercial for a phone company features someone
who looks a lot like him. Is it his son?
</P>
<P>
   _ C.C., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A: Danza appears in an MCI commercial with his son, Marc, a
27-year-old venue planner for ESPN's X Games.
</P>
<P>
   Danza was 19 when his son was born. People magazine included the
pair in the father-and-son category of its 1998 ``Sexiest Man
Alive'' issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sort of grew up together, so we're pretty friendly,'' Tony
Danza told the magazine. Each served as best man at the other's
wedding. Tony Danza also has daughters ages 5 and 11.

GETTING IN SHAPE TO TAKE ON THE GARDEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By TOVAH MARTIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I was a nascent gardener in the late 1960s, there was a
popular book called ``How to Have a Green Thumb Without an Aching
Back,'' a revolutionary work expounding mulching and other
low-maintenance techniques. It was later reissued under another
title; I think I know why. The original title was an obvious
contradiction in terms.
</P>
<P>
   To garden is to ache. Not only does gardening entail
considerable sweat of brow, but groans and grunts are also
intrinsic to the domain. The pain ensues in the panic of
early-spring planting mania and, if you're worth your salt, it
continues unabated through summer. Aches go with the turf, but
injuries are another matter entirely. All serious gardeners live in
mortal fear of incurring a muscle spasm, wrist trauma or other
debilitating horror that will take them out of commission for the
rest of the growing season.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, I thought the only preventive actions I could
take were bending my knees when picking up manure bags and saying
nightly prayers. Then I met Barbara Pearlman, a 57-year-old former
dancer who has been a fitness expert and personal trainer for 20
years, an avid weekend gardener and author of the new book
``Gardener's Fitness: Weeding Out the Aches and Pains'' (Taylor
Publishing, $12.95).
</P>
<P>
   ``If all you did throughout winter was leaf through seed
catalogs, you are bound to realize aches and pains in spring,''
Mrs. Pearlman said in an interview. At a juncture when your body is
in rock-bottom condition, it is bound to hurt when you suddenly
decide to move mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gardening is an active contact sport,'' she said. And sure
enough, Dr. Gary Ostrow, an osteopathic physician in New York City
specializing in pain management, whose patients include many
gardeners, says he knows when the growing season kicks off. ``They
come in with the whole host of problems, and it's definitely
seasonal,'' Dr. Ostrow said.
</P>
<P>
   In the best of all worlds, gardeners would prepare for the
season by including abdominal strengthening and weight-lifting
exercises into their New Year's resolutions. Prespring training
would be aimed at the back, knees, hands and wrists _ the points of
most common complaint. But who has the foresight or the impetus for
gardener-strengthening calisthenics when the ground is still
frozen?
</P>
<P>
   Spring hurts, but serious injuries may be more apt to occur in
summer. Teresa Cornish, a personal trainer and an intern at the
Rusk Institute of Rehabilitative Medicine in Manhattan, uses the
analogy of ballet dancers' being more prone to serious accidents at
the height of their careers. ``A deconditioned muscle,'' Ms.
Cornish said, ``isn't sufficiently strong to generate enough force
to create a severe injury.''
</P>
<P>
   In spring, the big problem is usually fatigue, and the pain that
accompanies it. Summer is a whole different story. You've built
muscle mass, you've gained strength, so you're more apt to push the
limit. ``You overestimate your strength,'' Ms. Cornish said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Pearlman says that midsummer is when most gardening
accidents happen and that the best precautionary measures are
wearing properly cushioned footwear and being sure to do stretching
warm-ups beforehand. ``You're not warming up for the Olympics,
you're just stretching your hamstrings, knees and other vulnerable
points,'' she said. Knee rolls (lying on your back, knees bent,
moving them side to side) and cat stretches (arching the back
upward while on all fours) are recommended. ``You don't want to do
sit-ups right before you garden,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   During gardening, it's a good idea to alternate activities as
often as possible. ``Switch the workload often, develop
ambidexterity,'' Ms. Pearlman suggested. ``Switch the rake or hoe
from hand to hand. And alternate heavy grunt work with lighter
tasks. You'll still get it all done.'' There are ways of easing
some risks. If you have to push a wheelbarrow uphill, brace
yourself by pulling in your stomach muscles.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you exert, exhale,'' Mrs. Pearlman said. To fend off
accidents when lifting or toting heavy loads, try to move smoothly
rather than making jerking motions.
</P>
<P>
   Although gardeners can be prone to carpal tunnel problems
because of the repetitive nature of some tasks, the back is a
gardener's primary sore point, Mrs. Pearlman said. For this reason,
try to avoid performing chores bending over.
</P>
<P>
   Squat instead. And when you do, ``your heels should be flat on
the ground,'' not raised, Mrs. Pearlman said. ``It isn't easy, but
it's recommended.'' Position yourself as close to your work as
possible so as not to overtax your back in stretching. And when
you've finished, a warm shower or bath is therapeutic.
</P>
<P>
   If you find yourself with severely fatigued muscles nonetheless,
Ms. Pearlman recommends applying a warm heating pad for 15 minutes
on and 15 minutes off to activate the blood flow.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of a spasm, apply ice to keep the swelling down.
Unless a doctor prescribes bed rest after a problem, Mrs. Pearlman
suggests continuing to garden cautiously.
</P>
<P>
   ``But don't be cavalier,'' she said. ``There's no reason why
working the beds should render you bedridden.''  &QL;

 &HT;    INSIDE AL GORE'S POLICY FACTORY
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories for release
Sunday, June 20.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the policies at the heart of his just-launched
presidential candidacy, Vice President Al Gore relies on the help
of a small, tightly knit cadre of advisers who, like Gore himself,
relish the competition of ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``A range of views, in many circumstances, is what's wanted, and
(Gore) certainly doesn't discourage competition,'' said William
Galston, a University of Maryland professor who has been a part of
Gore's brain trust since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike President Clinton, whose policy sessions often
resemble a late-night bull session in a college dorm, the Gore
policy team follows a disciplined course, guided by what Galston
calls the ``prism'' through which the vice president evaluates all
issues: ``the well-being of the American family.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the brain trust are ``policy wonks'' around the age
of 50 who share a wry sense of humor. Many are campaigned-hardened,
some even veterans of Democratic Party politics of the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   When the Gore brain trust assembles _ typically about once a
week, if travel schedules allow _ it is not unusual for its members
to stage debates for the vice president. And Gore often adopts the
strongest argument as his stand, according to Galston.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, for example, the Gore advisers debated whether the
federal government should form partnerships with religious
organizations involved in social work. Galston argued that
religious organizations are better suited than government to heal
families torn apart by social ills, while Harvard law professor
Christopher Edley asserted that such an arrangement was
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Galston prevailed. And within weeks, Gore came out in favor of
the partnerships in an Atlanta speech, promoting the notion that
``the power of love'' and ``the politics of community'' can restore
families and rebuild neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Gore uses these debates to examine all sides of an issue, even
though he often knows in advance what his position will be.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to shaping policy, ``we do not and will not have
an elaborate process as everyone else in the race, for one simple
reason _ the vice president has been in office seven years and he
knows 10 times as much as anyone else,'' said Elaine Kamarck, a
Harvard University political science professor who serves as the
unofficial chair of Gore's group of advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't have to be briefed on issues,'' she added, a veiled
reference to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the Republican
presidential front-runner. Bush has spent much of this spring
studying national and foreign issues in preparation for his first
White House run.
</P>
<P>
   Kamarck, 48, the executive director of Visions of Governance for
the 21st Century, a research program at Harvard University's John
F. Kennedy School of Government, is the most experienced
``political practitioner'' in Gore's brain trust, having worked on
five presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   She is media-savvy, but sharp-tongued. It was Kamarck who helped
stir up media interest in Gore's Atlanta speech by telling
reporters: ``The Democratic Party is going to take God back this
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to joining the Harvard faculty, Kamarck was Gore's senior
policy adviser, a position that gave her responsibility for the
National Performance Review, the official title of the Gore-led
effort to ``reinvent government.''
</P>
<P>
   But before that, she was a senior fellow at the Progressive
Policy Institute, the think tank of the Democratic Leadership
Council (DLC), the centrist organization founded after the
disastrous defeat of Walter Mondale by Ronald Reagan in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Kamarck and Galston published many of the policy papers that
eventually became the ``New Democratic'' philosophy on which Bill
Clinton ran successfully for president in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, Gore's positions are not forged in a political vacuum,
but his brain trust is not restricted to DLC types. A relative
newcomer to the group, for example, is Housing and Urban
Development Secretary Andrew Cuomo, the personable son of former
Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York, who advises the vice president on
community development.
</P>
<P>
   Edley is another example. He is largely responsible for the vice
president's ``livability'' agenda and ``lifelong learning''
proposals. But it is on the issue of race that the influence of
Edley, an African American, is mostly felt.
</P>
<P>
   A ``Great Society'' liberal who was one of Mondale's policy
advisers in the 1984 presidential campaign, Edley is a staunch
defender of affirmative action. He helped fashion the Clinton
administration's defense of the anti-discrimination program: ``Mend
it, don't end it.''
</P>
<P>
   He also has helped Gore connect with black voters. He arranged
the vice president's 1998 Martin Luther King Day speech at
Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church, in which Gore, with a preacher's
cadence, railed against opponents of affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has also reached beyond the DLC for economic advice. He
often consults former Federal Reserve vice chairman Alan Blinder,
now an economics professor at Princeton University, and Laura
Tyson, dean of business at the University of California at Berkeley
and a former chairman of the White House Council of Economic
Advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would suggest the following ...'' is a typical professorial
preface to Tyson's remarks. She is more relaxed and jovial than
most of Gore's advisers. When she worked at the White House, her
staff called her Laura.
</P>
<P>
   Blinder, an avid tennis player and sports fan, is a
self-described ``inflation dove'' who tends to emphasize job
creation over any fear of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that Gore would turn to former Clintonites
for economic advice, since it is in the area of economic policy
that the vice president would be least likely to initiate major
changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the policies President Clinton and I have proposed ...
America now has the strongest economy in the history of the United
States,'' Gore said in formally declaring his presidential campaign
Wednesday (June 16). ``We remember what it was like seven years
ago. And I never, never want to go back.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, even on economic policy, ``it is in Gore's
interest to go beyond the Clinton circle if he is to effectively
make the case that he is his own man and not just a Clinton
clone,'' warned West.
</P>
<P>
   The foreign policy side of the Gore team _ virtually unknown
outside of Washington _ is led by Leon Fuerth, a former Foreign
Service officer who for the past 20 years has advised Gore on a
wide range of international and military issues.
</P>
<P>
   The quirky and always rumpled Fuerth is ``one of the most
powerful but rarely seen people who play major roles behind the
scene in Washington,'' diplomat Richard Holbrooke wrote in his
memoir, ``To End a War.''
</P>
<P>
   He is a member of the so-called ``principals committee'' in the
Clinton foreign policy apparatus and often sits at the table with
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Defense Secretary William
Cohen and White House national security adviser Sandy Berger.
</P>
<P>
   Fuerth hardly ever grants interviews, unusual for someone in
Washington who is at the center of policy making. But it is rare
that Gore does not mention Fuerth when discussing foreign policy
with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two of them underwent a mind meld at some point,'' said
Chris Lehane, the vice president's press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Fuerth is an improbable example of the wry humor found in Gore's
brain trust. Once, during a flight to California with the vice
president, Fuerth went to the lavatory to change from a sport shirt
and khakis into a business suit. ``This,'' he said, ``is where I go
into the phone booth and come out as _ STAFF MAN!''

   ``Pirates of Silicon Valley'' is an amusement-park ride of a
movie, a breezy trip through the ups and downs of the rivalry
between Apple's Steve Jobs and Microsoft's Bill Gates. It's
stylized, surfacy fun, sketching out classic moments in Silicon
legend and Geek culture without really expecting you to grok the
meaning of terms like BASIC, MS-DOS, and Xerox PARC. With a giddy
script and a pair of EZ-to-watch performances, particularly from
Noah Wylie as the obsessive Jobs, the movie is very user-friendly:
Personal Computer History for Dummies.
</P>
<P>
   Which isn't to say that ``Pirates of Silicon Valley,''
premiering Sunday night at 8 on TNT, approaches accuracy, or even
fairness. Writer-director Martyn Burke doesn't bother with
three-dimensional portraits of his pirates or their business
tricks, opting for the broad, the provocative, and, as the industry
explodes wide open, the exhilarating. The unauthorized portrayals
of both Jobs and Gates are negative, for the most part, with the
two men graduating from their quirky college visionary days to
become business tyrants and unappealing individuals. And robbers of
sorts, as they have the insight and ambition to piece together
their revolution from the products of other companies.
</P>
<P>
   The movie is mostly interested in Jobs, whose
hippie-to-big-bully story is juicier than Gates's misfit-to-Big
Brother story, and offers better soundtrack opportunities (is that
really ``In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida''?). We see Jobs as a young, bearded
hippie at Berkeley, taking acid and dancing with the Hare Krishnas.
We hear him railing against IBM and spouting grand notions about
the industry: ``This ain't just business. This is practically
spiritual. This is about overthrowing dead culture, dead gods.''
And finally we see him as a demented leader and soul-sucking
employer, throwing tantrums in the office and demoralizing his
workers. One of the movie's only sympathetic bits shows him as a
troubled adoptee hiring a detective to find his real mother. Later,
when he coldly rejects his own daughter, Lisa (after whom he goes
on to name a computer), we're probably meant to understand his
discomfort with parenthood.
</P>
<P>
   Gates, meanwhile, is forever sitting bug-eyed at his computer,
in aviator glasses. While Jobs prods investors with a religious
fury, Gates takes the diplomatic approach to moneymaking: ``Your
machine is brilliant, but it needs our language.'' In some ways,
Gates's stiff, bland demeanor and his talent at poker make him seem
like more of a monster than Jobs, whose flagrant flaws are
recognizably human. But Gates is really a supporting character in
``Pirates,'' there mostly to provide a cool contrast to Jobs. As
Gates, Anthony Michael Hall sets up a collection of convincing
physical attributes, then adds a bit of vague mystique to the mix.
His Gates never seems to have much of an inner life, but then that
may be Hall's precise intention. When an enraged Jobs yells at him,
``You took our stuff, you fooled with it, and you called it your
own,'' he replies, ``Yeah, so?''
</P>
<P>
   Wylie, on the other hand, is a thunderstorm as Jobs. On ``ER,''
he brings a subtle range to his recovering-preppie doctor, John
Carter, but in ``Pirates'' he lets his freak flag fly, with his
Jobs walking that fine line between the headiness of the 1960s
counterculture and old-fashioned fascism. Sure, the period costumes
and makeup help, but Wylie delivers. So does Joey Slotnick as Apple
cofounder Steve Wozniak, the easy-tempered, technology-minded half
of the Apple team who left Apple in 1985 to teach computer classes.
His Woz is the movie's conscience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pirates'' is alternately narrated by Woz and Gates's
right-hand man, Steve Ballmer, an unnecessary technique that
ultimately peters out. But the real problem with ``Pirates'' comes
at the very end, when the movie trails off without a sufficient
sense of climax. Instead of using the end to clarify and put a
point on the drama of envy and competition and self-delusion and
power that we've just watched, writer-director Burke lets the
action dissipate. The movie disappears in a momentary glitch.

ORTON HEARS A HOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   First, the bad news. Beth Orton woke up with an impacted wisdom
tooth and was in terrible pain _ with a mood to match _ the day we
spoke on the phone. On the upside, her condition inspired some
stream-of-consciousness riffing on the connection between pain and
wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like my tooth, trying to come through now. Pain brings
about growth. And growth is wisdom. It's sort of about being rooted
and not rooted. Being not rooted gives you other roots,'' says
Orton. Forgive the British singer-songwriter her rambling. She
aches in lots of places. And besides, it's that wandering spirit
that fuels her music.
</P>
<P>
   Equal parts wired and winsome, Orton navigates traditional folk
music, hip-hop beats, and cutting-edge electronica in the span of a
song. This is a girl who collaborates with Chicaco soul singer
Terry Callier one minute, and dance-floor gurus the Chemical
Brothers the next. ``It's funny. I think it's possible to have
these conflicting polar opposites in us all the time,'' says Orton.
She's not talking simply about sonic styles. Lyrically, as well,
the 28-year-old Londoner fuses a patchwork of heartbreak and
hopefulness that matches her music with an eerie sort of emotional
lull _ and the dreamy sensation of both coming and going at once.
``Yeah, I was thinking about that just today. As soon as you see
one thing as the truth, it's almost a lie a second later, I
suppose. Music is for me a way of trying to gain some kind of
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Dubbed the Comedown Queen by the London press, Orton is quick to
point out that she's actually not the sullen depressive that her
nickname suggests. ``I'm not a broken-down, heartbroken person. I
think that term's got a different connotation in England. People in
London put on my record after coming home from the clubs. You know,
I like to give people a good landing.''
</P>
<P>
   While Orton's 1997 solo debut, ``Trailer Park,'' was an
intoxicating trance-folk cocktail, her new CD, ``Central
Reservation,'' is a less consistent effort. Orton was reportedly
dealing with some serious health issues during the recording
sessions, and some emotional ones, too. ``You know, everything
really was quite tough,'' Orton concedes. ``But it's always like
you've never made a record before, and you're a complete novice. We
started off strangely. We lost a producer, and I wasn't well for a
while.'' She declines to elaborate on that subject, but offers that
``it was tough for strange reasons. Some days it all falls into
place, though. Like on `Sweetest Decline,' when Dr. John happened
to be next door and came in and played.''
</P>
<P>
   Orton will bring a sparse band of drums, bass, and acoustic
guitar to the Fleadh (and the Newport Folk Festival, where she'll
play in August) _ although that lineup is considerably more fleshed
out than the single guitarist she brought to last winter's show at
the Lansdowne Street Playhouse in Boston. Is she concerned about
her music reaching the audience in such a large concert setting?
``I've done one or two before. And yeah, it can be difficult. But
it's all right as long as I'm singing.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a day in early June, a day of unusual social synergy,
when normally opposing planets orbited each other for a brief
moment, aligned and then spun back away into their separate
universes.
</P>
<P>
   In the Grill Room of the Four Seasons restaurant, Brooke Astor
and Barbara Walters occupied the center booth. As delicate looking
as a pair of painted dolls, the two, grande dames of New York
society and media, did not sip their espressos; they merely touched
the silver-rimmed cups occasionally with the most tentative,
symbolic hand gestures.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of the room, the designer Yves Saint Laurent sat
while a blonde _ his frequent companion, Betty Catroux _ spoke loud
French and, holding up her arm as if for a bicep curl, fanned the
air beneath her outstretched limb.
</P>
<P>
   And at the far end of the room, the rock star Bono was arriving
to sit down with Timothy P. Shriver, the director of the Special
Olympics and the brother of Maria Shriver. His hair sprouting
erratically upward, Bono wore wraparound sunglasses and took a seat
next to a third table mate, a young woman who seemed to be wearing
a children's toy in her hair. Bono craned his neck up to survey the
room and mouthed one word, ``Wow.''
</P>
<P>
   But no one bothered to look. Because in the Four Seasons _ where
everyone is well known, wealthy, powerful, politically connected,
supernaturally beautiful or just lucky to be there _ Bono was not,
in this room, a world-famous rock star. He was just there.
</P>
<P>
   The Four Seasons _ with its coolly elegant interior that is a
designated city landmark _ is New York's ultimate grown-up version
of the high school cafeteria, except every table is the cool table.
On almost any weekday at lunch in the Grill Room _ the smaller of
two rooms with 20-foot ceilings and walnut paneling _ there are so
many familiar figures from finance, politics, media and fashion
that this city of seven million can seem like Mayberry R.F.D., made
up of 100 or so souls, and the Four Seasons its Snappy Lunch
counter at the corner of Main and Elm Streets.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by Philip Johnson, who is still given a daily corner
booth, the restaurant opened on July 21, 1959, with a $4.5 million
price tag _ in 1959 dollars _ that shocked even jaded New Yorkers.
Some of the potential names for the restaurant considered by the
then-owners, Restaurant Associates, included Cleopatra's,
Season-o-Rama, Season-Go-Round and Restaurant of the Seven Wonders.
</P>
<P>
   Forty years later, the Four Seasons thrives. Its singular role
in the life of New York will be marked June 24 at a 40th birthday
party, whose hosts are Graydon Carter, the editor of Vanity Fair,
and Edgar Bronfman Jr., the president of the Seagram Co., which has
been the majority owner of the restaurant since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The Four Seasons may be the only place in the world where a
plain baked potato _ without butter, without sour cream _ costs $9,
a bottle of Bordeaux can easily run $800 and a woman who eschews
dessert will find herself face to face with a three-foot-high pile
of cotton candy, a not-so-subliminal exhortation from the waiter to
eat.
</P>
<P>
   Lest you complain about the price of the baked potato, Julian
Niccolini, the maitre d'hotel, will respond by sending a bushel of
raw Idaho potatoes to your office, and raising the price on the
menu.
</P>
<P>
   Peter G. Petersen, the chairman of the investment banking firm
Blackstone Group, and recipient of such a bushel, sums up the Four
Seasons like this: ``The booths are far enough apart that you can
have a private discussion. The real New York, New Yorkers go there,
like Lew Rudin, Barbara Walters, Diane Sawyer. And it's a social
experience. You'll always see six or eight people who are fun to
see.''
</P>
<P>
   Other New York restaurants have their particular crowds. Broadly
speaking, Michael's attracts the publishing world, 44 at the
Royalton Hotel the fashion industry, ``21'' Club the investment
bankers and Wall Street, Elaine's the cigar-chomping columnists and
actors.
</P>
<P>
   But none have the architectural grandeur of the Four Seasons or
the ability to mix movers and shakers from across the board. If New
York business and society were the mafia, the Four Seasons, wedged
into a corner of the Seagram Building on Park Avenue and 52d
Street, would be the meeting place of its five families' high
commission.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it maintains an unexpected level of democracy.
Alan Richman, the food critic for GQ magazine, said that the Four
Seasons ``is one of the last high-level democratic institutions.
You'll see Si Newhouse sitting next to a tourist from Cleveland.
It's one of the things I love about the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Political reputations are not burnished to a high gleam at
``21'' Club, whereas Richard C. Holbrooke, the investment banker
who is the president's nominee to be chief envoy to the United
Nations, is a weekly regular at the Four Seasons. And so is Alfonse
D'Amato, who may no longer have a political reputation to buff, but
he dined there last Monday with Charles A. Gargano, New York
state's commissioner of economic development, and Steven T. Florio,
the president of Conde Nast Magazines. The assumption that
deal-making is always the matter at hand is clearly in effect:
``There's nothing going on here!'' Florio said upon spying a
reporter and waving his hands in front of him, as if to deflect a
wild-eyed member of the paparazzi.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Fortune 500 Mortimer's,'' said Michael Batterberry, a
cultural historian and co-author of ``On the Town in New York: the
Landmark History of Eating, Drinking and Entertainments from the
American Revolution to the Food Revolution'' (Routledge, 1998).
``Symbolically, its landmark status is apt in that sense. People
who eat there are painfully famous, and excited to see each other,
and famous people seem to need that kind of exclusive shelter.''
</P>
<P>
   Batterberry added that much of the restaurant's feeling of
finesse and pranksterish joie de vivre emanate from Niccolini, a
native of Tuscany, who is also the co-manager and a minority owner
of the Four Seasons. (His rather more forbidding Austrian
counterpart, Alex von Bidder, is the restaurant's general manager
and also a minority owner.) ``Julian understands the discreet
hand-flashing and signals, the subtle salutations across a sea of
celebrities,'' Batterberry said. ``By now, I think it is
indestructible.''
</P>
<P>
   Niccolini, indeed, plays the role of conductor. Every morning
before 11 a.m., he begins constructing that day's seating chart, as
elaborate a diagram as a set of stage directions for a Puccini
opera. His theory is simple: ``If I see a story in the newspaper
pitting two people against each other,'' he said last week over a
glass of 1996 Clos St. Denis, ``then I try and put them near each
other. If I see that an ex-boyfriend and an ex-girlfriend are
coming in, Woops! They go next to each other.'' He paused, sipped
his wine, and said: ``Take into consideration that I am a devil.
But I am a good devil.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Niccolini takes pride that he is as much an agent provocateur as
he is a restaurateur. Two weeks ago, Niccolini seated the
Washington Post columnist Lally Weymouth directly across the room
from Andrew Stein, the former Manhattan borough president. Stein
was lunching with Shirley MacLaine, a longtime friend. Niccolini
said he watched, bemused, as Stein beckoned Ms. Weymouth to come
over and visit their table several times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ms. Weymouth thought I was playing Cupid,'' Niccolini said.
And he did not deny it.
</P>
<P>
   If decorum seems to accompany every meal at the Four Seasons, it
is not always the central ingredient. Last summer, for example,
there was ``the naked ladies' incident,'' as the staff calls it.
``A certain New York gentleman of means,'' Niccolini said, asked
him to make sure that his girlfriend and three companions had a
nice lunch in the restaurant's adjoining Pool Room, which features
a softly splashing fountain constructed of white Carrara marble.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much did they drink?'' Niccolini asked himself, stroking
his chin and lifting one eyebrow. ``They drank eight bottles. No,
it was 11 bottles of wine. I walked up to see how they were doing _
it was four women, and 11 bottles of wine is a lot, you know? One
woman said to me, `Julian, can I go for a swim?' No one was left in
the Pool Room, so I said, `Fine. Do whatever you want.' And she
took off the napkin on her lap, and she was totally naked!''
</P>
<P>
   The four women slipped into the pool, he said. He did not stop
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop them?'' he asked, his eyes wide. ``But I'm Italian!''
</P>
<P>
   The women splashed around in the 400-square-foot pool until the
staff gathered, Niccolini said, and then he offered them
tablecloths as towels. The bill for lunch _ 11 bottles of excellent
wine and a few salads _ was $7,000.
</P>
<P>
   In another oft-told incident, Anna Wintour, the editor in chief
of Vogue, was seated in a booth a couple of years ago when an
animal rights protester managed to wind her way past Niccolini and
toss a frozen raccoon on the table, in protest of Vogue's fondness
for fur. Richard D. Beckman, the publisher of Vogue (and a man who
chose the Pool Room as the site for his wedding last fall), said
that Niccolini picked up the raccoon with a tablecloth and asked
the woman, ``Would you like me to put this in the freezer for
you?'' ( Niccolini said that he did not remember exactly what he
said, but he was sure it was not that witty.)
</P>
<P>
   It was Lee Eisenberg, writing in Esquire magazine in the late
1970s, who is thought to have coined the term ``power lunch'' in a
reference to the noon meal at the Four Seasons. And there, last
Wednesday, was the Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations, Dore
Gold, with Ms. Weymouth. (``She's having a good hair day today,''
Niccolini mused.) There was Barry Diller, Art Buchwald, Mortimer
Zuckerman and Joe Armstrong, the publisher of Capital Publishing,
who last month wandered over to Brooke Astor's table, kissed her on
the cheek and said, ``Brooke, did you get that flashlight I sent
you last week?'' (Mrs. Astor, he explained, was traveling to
England, and she had complained to him about the habit in English
country houses of turning off the electricity at night.)
</P>
<P>
   On another date earlier this month, Vernon Jordan worked the
room, receiving at least three visitors to his booth, and stopping
by at least three more tables. Senator Charles Schumer dined in
late May with Bronfman, atop the Grill Room balcony, Bronfman's
usual aerie. Lisa Caputo, Hillary Rodham Clinton's former press
secretary, at center stage down below, wiggled her finger in their
direction and, the husky tones of intrigue coloring her voice,
said, ``I wonder what's going on up there?''
</P>
<P>
   The Four Seasons works in part thanks to the daily choreography
of Niccolini, and to the famous clientele, further guaranteed by
the presence of the dashing Bronfman _ with his dining companions
from the worlds of politics, business and Hollywood. The
restaurant's landlord is the current owner of the Seagram Building,
the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association-College Retirement
Equities Fund. ``The rent is substantial, but it allows us to stay
in business,'' von Bidder said. The restaurant generates about $16
million a year in revenue, according to Restaurants and
Institutions Newsletter, the sixth highest-grossing restaurant in
the city. It ranks behind Tavern on the Green, Windows on the
World, Smith &AMP; Wollensky, Sparks and ``21'' Club. But whereas those
others earn their grosses primarily through high turnover of the
tables, the slower-paced Four Seasons charges sky-high prices _ an
average of $100 a person with wine. The Zagat Survey ranked it No.
1 in popularity in 1989, 1990 and 1991; it is now No. 7.
</P>
<P>
   In these giddy times, the prices have not kept customers away.
John Mariani, the author of ``The Four Seasons: A History of
America's Premiere Restaurant'' (Crown, 1994), said that 20 years
ago, the restaurant tended to frighten customers with its frosty
treatment. ``The first time I went there, I tell you, I was coming
up that stairway, and I did not find it a happy place to be,'' he
said. ``It was back in the '70s, and my college friends and I
brought my mother there for drinks, because it was all we could
afford. And we walked out on the bill because no one would bother
to bring it to us.'' Mariani said he has owed them $17 ever since.
``There was something fierce about it then. But they have loosened
up. In terms of the parties they have and the kinds of things
they'll let you do there, well, with enough money, you can get them
to do anything for you.''
</P>
<P>
   For the restaurant's 40th birthday cocktail party this week,
over 800 guests _ Ron Perelman, Wendy Wasserstein, Charlie Rose,
Tommy Mottola, Barry Diller, Ed Koch, Jonathan Tisch, Bryant
Gumbel, Larry Gagosian, David Dinkins _ are expected to throng the
Pool and Grill Rooms.
</P>
<P>
   And Richman, the GQ critic, is nervous. ``People are calling me
to see if I can bring them,'' he said. ``This is the first
out-of-control event I have heard of at the Four Seasons. So this
party gives me the chills. I definitely wanted to be there when it
was a mere 40th anniversary cocktail party. Now, do I want to be
there just because it's important to be there?''

FATHER'S DAY IS ALL ABOUT ...
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lucky is the boy with a dad like mine. I'd wish for every lad to
have, and every dad to be, such a father. His was clearly the
greatest influence in my life, and the memories of things he said
and did are fresh with me daily, although he died 37 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, my father didn't have a dad to remember. His died
when my dad was an infant. His mother was a polio victim, confined
to a wheelchair. My father, consequently, had to leave school in
the fifth grade to chop cotton and later work at a brick kiln.
</P>
<P>
   Then, as now with ghetto youth, the quickest route to money for
a strong Texas farm boy lay in professional athletics. Jack Johnson
was heavyweight champion. Dad, at 20, became a professional boxer,
performing in Detroit, Philadelphia, New York.
</P>
<P>
   When he'd saved up enough cash, he returned to Weatherford and
bought a cleaning establishment and a tailor shop. He also was
commander, in his 20s, of the local National Guard unit when
President Woodrow Wilson federalized the Texas National Guard. It
patrolled the Mexican border to deter incursions by Pancho Villa's
revolutionary army.
</P>
<P>
   There, in the Big Bend town of Valentine, Dad and Mother were
married. She, a teacher and drama coach, was enormously helpful to
him. Dad was an avid reader with a voracious thirst for history,
and the two shared a lifelong love of poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Dad's unfulfilled ambition for higher formal education made him
determined to avail his children of its benefits. Before I was 8,
he was taking me to college football games where he'd extol the
special virtues of various centers of learning.
</P>
<P>
   He gave me my first serious nonfiction book when I was 7. It was
a biography of Jack Dempsey. I practically memorized it. Soon I had
a life story of Andrew Jackson. Then one of Knute Rockne.
</P>
<P>
   Dad and Mother never subscribed to the theory that their
children should be seen but not heard. They actively encouraged
self-expression in each of us. To recite a newly memorized poem at
the dinner table _ be it philosophical, sentimental or humorous _
earned our parents' outspoken approbation.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh grade, I was convinced that geography was boring
until Dad began telling me of things he'd seen in some of the
countries that my class was studying. He convinced me that travel
was fun, and infinitely more fun for somebody who'd studied the
geography of the area and knew what to look for.
</P>
<P>
   He taught me tricks of memory _ like associating names with
other objects _ that made it easier to recall the capitals of other
lands. Constantinople, for example, was a breeze. Just remember:
Can't stand on an apple!
</P>
<P>
   I was 11 the year we lived in Duncan, Okla. Dad was manager of
the local chamber of commerce. We didn't have a car, or really need
one. We walked.
</P>
<P>
   It was Dad's conviction that a boy should have a job. Each
Saturday morning I'd earn a quarter delivering circulars. For a
dime I'd attend a Saturday afternoon movie, and a nickel bought a
hamburger. That left a dime to spend however I wished.
</P>
<P>
   I'd carefully examine the colorful Sunday papers at the town's
best newsstand and then take one home _ from Denver, or Chicago, or
New York. I always looked for one with the most funnies and the
best sport section, so Dad and I could discuss upcoming events.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday mornings, the family went to the Presbyterian church.
But Sunday evenings belonged to Dad and me. We'd visit, by turn,
Duncan's other churches. All had Sunday evening services in those
days. Walking home, we'd discuss the minister's sermon _ its
content, mainly, but also the preacher's oratorical style.
</P>
<P>
   At 12, I was accompanying Dad occasionally on ``Good Will
tours'' to surrounding rural communities. In those days before
television, entertainment was scarce. The chamber of commerce, in
behalf of the town's merchants, would bring home talent to the
hustings. I'd play the harmonica. Later in the program, a sparring
partner and I would put on a boxing exhibition. I didn't know I was
learning things, but I was _ things like confidence and
self-reliance.
</P>
<P>
   Dad was an egalitarian. He met everyone on a level plane.
``Never look down on anybody because of his circumstances,'' he'd
say, ``and never let anyone look down on you for any reason
whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   He despised pretensions of class.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no such thing as an upper class or lower class in
America,'' he believed. ``Not in this country. Maybe in India or
even England, but not here. In America, the only ceiling above you
is the one you make for yourself.''
</P>

WATER, WATER EVERYWHERE IN NEW VEGAS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LAS VEGAS _ The reef shark, about a 24-incher, turned lazy
circles around the clump of coral. A sand castle was taking shape
at water's edge, although one turret fell victim to a clumsy lady
carrying an umbrella drink. A girl squealed as the inner tube she
was riding in rounded a curve in the lagoon and passed beneath a
waterfall.
</P>
<P>
   Just another day in the northern center of the Mojave Desert.
</P>
<P>
   Las Vegas has become quite the master of illusion. Or suspended
reality. In one two-mile length of the Strip, your senses are
assaulted by a pyramid, a medieval castle, the New York skyline,
ancient Rome, a northern Italian village, a pirate ship and, soon,
a tight cluster of Parisian landmarks.
</P>
<P>
   Anything goes, it seems, in the effort to convince you you're
anywhere but ... well, here.
</P>
<P>
   And now comes water. Gallons and gallons and gallons of it.
</P>
<P>
   The Mandalay Bay Resort &AMP; Casino recently opened at the extreme
south end of the Strip. The theme is forbidden tropics _ Disneyland
Jungle Cruise meets ``Some Enchanted Evening.'' That shark swims in
a fish tank in the lobby. The sandy beach adjoins a vast concrete
pool, where waves will break once they get the drains fixed. The
waterfall cascades into another pool that is vaguely configured as
a tropical stream.
</P>
<P>
   But Las Vegas' new-found fixation with water doesn't end here. A
few blocks up the Strip, on the site of the old Sands, the Venetian
continues to stagger through its multiphased opening. Newest
element to be unveiled: a quarter-mile canal that will wind through
a movie set of Venice facades. Part of the retail complex was due
to open this weekend; the hotel is hoping to have the remainder up
and running by the July 4 weekend.
</P>
<P>
   And outside the city, in nearby Henderson, Nev., a Hyatt Regency
Resort is being built on the shores of man-made Lake Las Vegas, a
320-acre pond that is already bordered by luxury homes and a Jack
Nicklaus-designed golf course. Guests of this hotel will be able to
windsurf and fish in the lake, careen down a water slide and frolic
in a lagoon off a sandy beach of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Much has been made in recent months about the upscaling of Las
Vegas: restaurants featuring celebrity chefs, elegant hotel
accommodations and top-end entertainment that transcends the
requisite lounge lizard singing ``Misty'' in white vinyl shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Another trend seems to be developing here, however. It's a
direct targeting of the resort traveler. The reasoning: Why should
Palm Springs and Scottsdale, Ariz., be conceded resort business
without a fight? In this land of blistering desert sun and
open-arms tax policies, why not throw up spacious spas, expansive
golf courses ... and lots and lots of pools?
</P>
<P>
   The Mandalay Bay property might embody the concept. Yes, it has
a casino _ a big, clamorous one with acres of green felt and armies
of cocktail waitresses not wearing much.
</P>
<P>
   But it also has a 2,000-seat House of Blues, a 1,700-seat
theater currently showing the Broadway musical ``Chicago,'' and a
12,000-seat events center that recently played host to boxer Oscar
De La Hoya's latest victory.
</P>
<P>
   Its adjoining food-and-booze court has the kind of trendy,
gimmicky establishments that baby boomers tend to froth over.
</P>
<P>
   In the Aureole restaurant, there is a four-story wine rack, and
young women in harnesses dangle alongside it to retrieve diners'
exotic selections.
</P>
<P>
   In the China Grill's Cafe and Zen Sum, a conveyor belt
continually carries appetizers along the inside rim of the backlit
bar. See something you like, just grab it; the bartender will make
sure it gets on your bill.
</P>
<P>
   In Rumjungle, a throbbing nightspot with soaring flames and
tumbling sheets of water, the menu features more than 100 varieties
of rum.
</P>
<P>
   In Red Square, there are just as many kinds of vodka, and
several of them are kept in a sub-zero, see-through locker.
</P>
<P>
   And then there's that playground outside. It features five pools
and 2.2 million gallons of water (including the private pool of the
adjacent Four Seasons). The largest is designed to feature 3-foot
waves, but a major problem with the drainage system caused the pool
to be shut down and drained for repair work just weeks after the
hotel's opening.
</P>
<P>
   An expansive ``beach'' of trucked-in sand lies at the foot of
the pool, and sunscreen-slathered guests walk around bearing fruity
tropical drinks as if they've fooled themselves into thinking
they're in ... .
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for that Maui feeling right here in the
desert,'' said Mandalay Bay general manager Michael Starr. ``It's
conceptualized,'' he added, ``from Wailea, on Maui _ that ocean
walk from the Renaissance to the Grand Wailea, the Four Seasons and
the Kea Lani.'' (Starr left out the Aston Wailea, but you get the
idea.) ``We're trying to create that ambience where you're going
from the hotel right to the beach.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby is a 30,000-square-foot spa, where a 55-minute Swedish
massage ($85) might relieve some of the sting of any casino losses.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the hotel's guests seem to be embracing the beach
experience eagerly.
</P>
<P>
   This facility would be a prime candidate for pool-crashing by
non-guests, so everyone is funneled through a narrow kiosk, where
towel boys check room keys. Most people head straight for the sand,
where chaise lounges await. Misting units cool the scene from
overhead and canned music (everything from Ventures-era surf rock
to Jimmy Buffett to rap) emanates mysteriously from fake rocks that
dot the scene.
</P>
<P>
   There is actually a sign here that reads, ``Capacity: 3,327.''
Pity the towel boy saddled with the responsibility of keeping that
count. It also provides a clue as to the difficulty of getting
beachside cocktail service. Many beach bums head into the centrally
located bar and grill to fetch their own drinks, where they
discover prices in keeping with the Maui resort theme (mai tai,
$6.75).
</P>
<P>
   There are other, more-conventional pools in the complex, plus
that river. It makes a 200-yard circle, and angled jets along the
side of the pool produce a gentle current _ about the pace of a Los
Angeles flood-control channel after a light drizzle. Just to keep
things interesting, the current will carry your inner tube beneath
two substantial waterfalls.
</P>
<P>
   There is yet another area that clearly isn't for everyone.
Bungalows back up to a serene pool area that has its own whirlpool
_ all of this behind a sturdy wall that has only one gate. When I
called to see what they rented for, the person in VIP services
asked, ``What's your room number?'' Uh oh. After being on hold for
a few moments, I was told that the hotel doesn't rent out the
bungalows but instead ``provides them to our casino guests.''
</P>
<P>
   There was one notable incongruity in this lush, tropical
complex. Every few minutes, a security guard wearing shorts,
CHP-issue sunglasses and a stern expression would pedal a bicycle
along the edge of the wave pool, scanning the beach and pretending
he wasn't just scoping out thong bikinis. The guy was packing a
!ital!sidearm!off!. Probably looking for the fellow who designed
the wave pool's original drainage system.
</P>
<P>
   Standard rooms at the Mandalay Bay are nicely appointed, but the
rate scale slides as precipitously as one of those waterfalls. When
I asked for a rate sheet at the front desk, a clerk instead handed
me an 800 reservations number and said, ``They can vary from $99 to
$399 depending on when you book and the demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Water has begun to flow nearly as freely just up the street,
where Sheldon Adelson has attempted to create Venice, Italy, on the
site where the Rat Pack used to cavort in the Sands, a hotel with a
desert-oasis theme.
</P>
<P>
   After tiring of delaying the hotel's debut, officials finally
opted to open in early May with what they had ready: hotel rooms
and a casino. (The latter facility could at least be counted on to
generate cash flow to cover construction bills.) Two weeks later,
workmen were still crawling over and through the shops, restaurants
and 236,000-gallon canal on the second level, trying to get that
feature ready. It is still weeks away from being fully open.
</P>
<P>
   It's all quite a feat of engineering. The canal and its complex
sit on top of the casino. Above the canal and shops is a blue,
movie-set sky, and above that ceiling is the pool, spa and
sunbathing deck for guests of the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Gondola rides along the canal's quarter-mile length will include
a song, but they won't be had for one: They're $5 per person. Hotel
spokesman Ryan Brooks noted that the nationwide search for
gondoliers was a bit complicated. ``They had to be able to sing in
Italian, steer a boat and know CPR, in case anyone fell in.''
</P>
<P>
   While conducting a recent hard-hat tour, Brooks pointed out the
restaurant that would be the only one to offer canal-side dining,
an obvious bid to capture the essence of Venice. Uh, it's a
Southwest-themed establishment, Canonita Taqueria. A peek inside
revealed a couple of saguaro cactus plants in pots.
</P>
<P>
   So much for illusion. &UR;  &QL;

MAYANS DEVELOPED RUBBER, RESEARCHERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Corrects spelling of Tarkanian.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Everybody thought that the process for making rubber was
invented in Europe in the mid-19th century. But everybody was
wrong. In fact, they were off by about 3,500 years, according to a
new report from MIT archeologists.
</P>
<P>
   When Spanish explorers first encountered Mayan cities in Central
America in the 1500s, one of the most astonishing sights they found
was a complicated, highly ritualized ball game played on
stone-rimmed courts as long as a football field, which sometimes
ended with human sacrifices (nobody is quite sure whether it was
the winners or the losers). What amazed the invaders most was the
large bouncy ball used in the game.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, the only kind of balls the Europeans knew how to
make were made of leather and stuffed with feathers, and they
didn't bounce much. The sight of the huge, bouncing rubber balls
the Mayans used _ some were a foot in diameter, made of solid
rubber, and weighed more than 15 pounds _ intrigued them. They
brought a few samples, and even a whole team for a demonstration
game, back to Spain to present to King Carlos V.
</P>
<P>
   But centuries passed before the secret of how to make rubber was
re-invented. And somehow, even though the Mayan ball games have
been well known to archeologists, nobody had thought to investigate
just what the balls were made of.
</P>
<P>
   That is, until three years ago, when MIT freshman Michael
Tarkanian of Brockton, Mass. heard a description of the ancient
games in an introductory archeology course taught by Dorothy
Hosler. He raised his hand to ask how the balls were made, and
Hosler _ a specialist in Mesoamerican archeology _ was stumped. She
suggested he investigate the question as a research project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody thought about it,'' Hosler explained in an interview.
``It was just one of those obvious questions that nobody asked.''
</P>
<P>
   So it turned out that nobody knew the answer, and that was the
beginning of a research project that continued for the last three
years and culminated in the publication in the journal Science of a
description of the discovery of the ancient rubber-making method.
The paper was co-authored by Hosler, MIT materials scientist Sandra
Burkett, and Tarkanian, who is now a junior _ a highly unusual
achievement for an undergraduate.
</P>
<P>
   After three trips to Mayan archeological sites in Mexico,
Tarkanian and Hosler found that Mayans in the region still know how
to produce rubber in the ancient way. The key discovery was a
precise mixture of two different plant substances.
</P>
<P>
   The main ingredient of rubber is latex, derived from the rubber
tree by making diagonal slashes in the bark and collecting the
sticky sap. But this material, by itself, is virtually useless. It
is too sticky to handle, and when it dries it becomes brittle
instead of rubbery.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Goodyear is credited with inventing the process to
transform latex into a usable rubber by a heat and sulfur process
in the late 19th century. A similar process had been patented in
England in 1843. But it turns out these latter-day rubber barons
were just reinventing the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the Mayan process was adding juice from a morning
glory vine, which also grows in the region. After the mixture is
stirred vigorously for 15 minutes, it reaches a consistency that
can be easily handled and shaped, and which dries to a bouncy,
durable rubber. The vine, the archeologists found, contains sulfur
compounds, and the process only works in hot weather, so the
process is closely analogous to modern rubbermaking.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of this process made it possible to make the
bouncy balls, which in turn led to the elaborate ball games that
were so central to Mayan society, which thrived from at least 2000
BC until the Spanish conquest.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no record of exactly how the game was played,
illustrations on Mayan pottery, the ballfields themselves, and
reports by explorers provide clues. In one version, a smaller ball
was hit with a stick. In another, it had to be thrown through an
overhead hoop.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out the Mayans made other things out of rubber as well,
and many of these artifacts, including hollow human figures and
wide rubber bands for attaching stone ax blades to shafts, have
recently been recovered from swampy sites where oxygen-free
conditions preserved the rubber.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery of the ancient rubber-processing method is the
latest achievement for MIT's unique Center for Materials Research
in Archeology and Ethnology, the only such department in the world,
which focuses on how ancient peoples processed the materials that
were crucial to their civilizations.

DENOUEMENT OF A FAMILY FEUD?  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 20) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Va.)   (af)  
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Leave it to the Internet to jump-start the formerly famous.
After making headlines five years ago as a key slugger in the Haft
family's legal brawl, the eldest son, Robert M., has re-emerged
selling vitamins in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   The venture, Vitamins.com, based in Falls Church, Va., seems
simple enough: Haft plans to use the Internet to sell vitamins that
are now available in his 10 Vitamin Superstores. But it has a
subplot. Not only does Haft, 46, want to bolster his company's
sales, projected this year to hit $28 million, but he also believes
that the site will reaffirm his stature as a wonder boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still feel like I have something to prove,'' he said. ``I
have to prove to a broader arena that what my father and I created,
I can create on my own.''
</P>
<P>
   One can understand his trepidation. The Hafts have built some
easily recognized businesses, including the Dart Drug and Crown
Books chains. But they equal the Ewings of TV's ``Dallas'' in
spewing venom publicly at each other. And Haft's new venture could
renew the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Looming behind everything Haft does is his father, Herbert H.
Haft, still recognizable for his lacquered pompadour. The senior
Haft bought a drugstore in 1955 and turned it into a big regional
chain. When the Hafts sold Dart Drug to several of its executives
in 1984, it had more than 70 stores.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Herbert Haft and his wife, Gloria, welcomed their
children into the family business, the Dart Group. Linda, 48, took
a job in finance. Ronald, 39, ran the real estate operation. After
getting an MBA from Harvard, Robert joined in 1977 and soon founded
Crown Books.
</P>
<P>
   The family hit its financial peak in 1993 _ its net worth
estimated at more than $500 million. But then everything fell
apart. That June, The Wall Street Journal said Robert Haft was the
sure heir to his father's job; Herbert Haft was enraged, and Robert
soon received a fax at home from his father's lawyer, telling him
never to come to the office again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Herbert saw that Wall Street Journal story as his business
obituary,'' said James G. Leonard, a former director at Crown Books
and Trak Auto, a parts chain that was part of the Haft empire.
``Robert was obviously very disappointed.''
</P>
<P>
   Angry might be more the word. Robert Haft sued his father,
contending wrongful termination, and in 1994 won a $38 million
judgment, including the value of investments, in a federal court.
Although Robert has said he would like to mend the rift, he still
dwells on their differences.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, he drew a diagram of Dart's sales. On the far
left of the time line, he jotted ``1955,'' the year of his father's
first store. In the middle of the line, he wrote ``1977,'' the year
he joined the company. To the right, he wrote ``1993.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' Robert Haft said, ``here are their sales until 1977.''
He drew a flat line. ``Well, maybe they did a little better than
that.'' He drew a line with a slight incline over his first one.
``Now, here is where I join the company.'' Haft extended the line
sharply northward, toward the company's peak sales. Then he drew a
sharp plunge from 1993, after his dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   The rift didn't end with Robert's lawsuit. His parents divorced,
with Herbert and Ronald soon parting ways over control of the
company. Robert has remained close to his mother and sister, but he
and his brother speak only occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Haft started over in a group of investors that took
control of Phar-Mor, a chain of discount drugstores, in 1995,
eventually raising $1 billion to pull the company out of
bankruptcy. When he tried to merge it with Shopko Stores in 1996,
some investors balked and bought him out.
</P>
<P>
   Haft, once a dedicated jogger, then decided to turn his health
interests into a business. In 1997, he invested $5 million to start
the 10 vitamin stores in the Washington area. He is so involved
with the Web site that he even picked colors for brochures. He
plans to take Vitamins.com public, but did not say when.
</P>
<P>
   Vitamins.com, which went on line in April, fits into his life
style. He usually walks four miles and pops nine vitamins a day. He
also speed-reads (he finished A. Scott Berg's 628-page biography of
Charles Lindbergh in one night) and attends a Bible class monthly.
</P>
<P>
   ``One reason that I really like Vitamins.com is that it allows
me to combine commerce with social good,'' Haft said. ``When I was
running Crown Books, I thought it was good that I was selling books
at a discount price. I have always been interested in how I can
help people.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears, too, that Haft has learned from his father's
mistakes. Haft attributes the family quarrel in part to his
father's controlling of the family fortune. Haft and his wife,
Mary, a producer for public TV, have set up trust funds for their
three children, giving them the freedom to enjoy the money when
they turn 21.
</P>
<P>
   Haft also regrets that he and his father, who gave up control of
Dart Group in 1998, aren't closer. But they may have a chance to
battle again. Herbert Haft has announced his own Web site,
Heathquick.com, to sell vitamins and nonprescription drugs. It is
set to go on line in July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our companies sell different things,'' the elder Haft said.
``But as far as there is an overlap, you can buy a small part of
what we sell at his site. We wish him well.''
</P>
<P>
   Discussing his father's new company, Haft became sentimental. He
acknowledged that his father was competition but added that other
companies were bigger threats. Could it be that the Haft family
ruckus has finally ended?
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you, I get calls all the time from people who say,
`My father did this or my brother did that to me,''' Haft said. ``I
always tell them the same thing: `Go back and try to work it out.'
I tell people that there's no paper too thin that's there's not
another side to it.''

NEW RESORTS STAKE OUT TURF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ Billed as alternatives to the Strip, their target
audience, a bit farther up the scale, favors golf and spas ... and
peace and quiet.
</P>
<P>
   And this is their daring leap: the expectation that a niche
market can be carved out for resort travelers who seek arm's-length
removal from the glare and commotion of Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next six months, two major resorts will open on the
outskirts of the city. The Resort at Summerlin, cradled amid five
golf courses on the northwestern edge of Las Vegas, plans to open
the first of two Regent hotels at the end of this month, the other
in early August. Lake Las Vegas Resort, in Henderson, Nev., on the
southeastern fringe of Las Vegas, plans to open a Hyatt Regency on
the shores of a man-made lake in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not positioning ourselves to compete with the Strip,''
said Brian Johnson, general manager of Summerlin's Regent Grand Spa
Hotel, which is targeted to open June 29. ``We're positioning
ourselves as a resort that will compete with the great resorts of
the Southwest.''
</P>
<P>
   The resort communities of Palm Springs and Scottsdale, Ariz.,
however, did not have to contend with nearby gluts of hotel space,
and therein lies the inherent challenge for these two ventures. Las
Vegas is a city of 225 square miles _ roughly the size of the
island of Guam _ yet it currently boasts 116,880 hotel rooms, most
of which are concentrated along a four-mile stretch of Las Vegas
Boulevard South.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the hotels that are part of the Strip's recent building
boom have targeted the resort traveler, too, putting in lavish spas
and pool areas. But they can't offer pro-quality golf courses or
the serenity of desert mountain views at sunset, and both outlying
ventures are determined to lure vacationers who desire both.
</P>
<P>
   The two resorts have taken different approaches to the issue of
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Lake Las Vegas is building a relatively small casino _ 10,000
square feet, 189 slots, 11 table games. It has a European design,
including a feature that would be unthinkable on the Strip _
windows; big, arched ones that overlook the lake and open onto a
balcony.
</P>
<P>
   A resort property in which the casino is more of an amenity than
a focal point ``has been the missing part to Las Vegas,'' said
marketing director Robert Purdy.
</P>
<P>
   The Resort at Summerlin, by contrast, has put in a much more
substantial casino. It's about half the size of a casino at a major
Strip property, but for the suburbs, it's considerable _ 50,000
square feet, 1,200 slots, 40 table games. Hotel officials say it
will have separate entrances, however, so that it won't be in the
faces of guests.
</P>
<P>
   The Summerlin resort is being marketed as a destination for
golfers who like to gamble, which is probably a bit redundant. The
goal here will be to entice them to wager on cards and dice once
they've settled their bets on the greens.
</P>
<P>
   The appointments promise to offer the tasteful touches that are
so hard to come by on the Strip. The two Regent hotels will be no
taller than six stories, offering a combined 541 rooms. Service?
They're going to have heat and motion detectors in the rooms so
that housekeeping personnel, by putting a card in an exterior slot,
will instantly know whether this is a good time to knock on your
door or come back later.
</P>
<P>
   Golfers will be able to take on the Tournament Players Club at
The Canyons _ the resort controls 50 percent of the tee times.
Johnson says there are 189 holes within a 20-minute drive of the
resort. And just for fun, two enormous bent-grass putting greens
have been constructed just outside a golfers' tavern at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Guests more interested in a spa experience are promised the
40,000-square-foot Aquae Sulis, where, if they're so inclined, they
can get a loofah scrub, soak in the Watsu tub, or stretch out for a
hot-stone massage.
</P>
<P>
   Similar golf-spa-and-gambling experiences are promised 17 miles
southeast of the Strip at Lake Las Vegas, a body of water created
10 years ago when water was pumped out of nearby Lake Mead.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Barbara developer Ron Boeddeker is heading the project,
playing on a philosophy that paid handsome dividends on the Big
Island of Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Boeddeker reasoned that people on vacation want a lush setting
without having to contend with the very element that produces
lushness: rain. His Transcontinental Corp. carved the Waikoloa
Village out of an arid stretch of black lava along the island's
Kohala Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The Lake Las Vegas project works on a similar principle. That
desert lake is an unnatural freak _ in fact, storm runoff from the
nearby Las Vegas Wash is diverted through a 7-foot-diameter pipe
that runs !ital!under!off! this body of water.
</P>
<P>
   The Hyatt Regency is encircled by a Jack Nicklaus-designed golf
course on the lake's north shore. Like the Summerlin resort, it
will buck Las Vegas Strip standards by being comparatively
minuscule _ 496 rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Hyatt guests will be able to take a water taxi across the lake
to the marina, where they might rent a sailboat, an electric boat,
fishing tackle, a windsurfing board. Or they might want to get wet
_ in the hotel's private lagoon (which will adjoin a sandy beach),
on a water slide, or in the lake itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people want to go to the Strip, it's close enough,'' said
Karen Summers, a resort spokeswoman. ``When they're done, they can
come back here and play golf the next day.'' &QL;

 &HT;    MICROSOFT TRIAL DRAWING TO A CLOSE
 &HT;    Moving in (f) financial and (w) Washington categories for
release Sunday, June 20.

   WASHINGTON _ As a thunderstorm struck during the afternoon rush
hour one day last week, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson, who presides over the Microsoft antitrust trial, stood in
front of the federal courthouse trying to hail a cab.
</P>
<P>
   Three reporters who have been covering the trial since last
October offered to share their cab with Jackson. To their surprise,
the judge, who is known for keeping his distance from the press,
readily hopped into the front seat.
</P>
<P>
   The conversation during the brief ride dealt mainly with
lighthearted courtroom gossip. But Jackson also chided the
journalists for reading too much into his comments from the bench,
some of which have been interpreted as being anti-Microsoft. In
effect, the judge urged the reporters to curb their guesswork, they
said. With the final defense witness in the landmark case due to
testify this week, both sides have begun to prepare their written
closing arguments. Barring an unexpected settlement, Jackson hopes
to issue his verdict by Labor Day, when the law clerk who has been
tracking the case is due to depart.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft will wind matters up Monday by calling its only
economic expert witness, Richard Schmalensee, dean of the business
school at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Schmalensee
had testified in January that Microsoft lacked monopoly power and
that its actions were a legitimate response to intense competitive
pressures.
</P>
<P>
   When the current rebuttal phase of the trial opened June 1,
Schmalensee's earlier testimony drew scorn from Franklin Fisher,
his MIT colleague and former teacher. Fisher, the government's
chief economic witness, accused Schmalensee of ``a lack of
systematic thinking.'' When it comes to antitrust policy, Fisher
said, his one-time student advances arguments that are ``silly''
and even ``ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   That kind of tough talk reflects the high stakes in the trial, a
proceeding in which both Microsoft and the Justice Department have,
from time to time, seemingly scored points that made an impression
on the judge.
</P>
<P>
   In the bringing its landmark case against Microsoft, the
government has sought to prove that the software giant withheld
crucial data about its dominant Windows operating system from its
rivals in a bid to prevent them from building successful competing
platforms. Rather than competing on the merits, the government
holds, Microsoft chose to repeatedly abuse its monopoly position to
retain its huge market power and to gain advantage in the emerging
Internet market.
</P>
<P>
   Some figures in the Microsoft camp fear those arguments have
struck home with Jackson. They've urged Microsoft chairman Bill
Gates to cut a deal that would protect the company from facing
corporate lawsuits based on any judicial finding that Microsoft is
a predatory monopolist.
</P>
<P>
   But Gates instead has bet on his ability to persuade key
lawmakers that traditional antitrust principles developed for
smokestack industries have little relevance in today's fast-paced
high-tech world.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, the multibillionaire spent six hours last week on
Capitol Hill. A lunch with 15 high-ranking House Republicans,
including Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois, was balanced by
another meal with Senate Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Several people who were present said Gates had told them:
</P>
<P>
   _ Our customers aren't complaining about our Internet products.
Our competitors egged the trust-busters to bring this case. Most
consumers and software developers see big benefits to them from
Microsoft's commitment to integrated products increasingly attuned
to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   _ The software industry is one of the great engines of economic
growth and job creation. We will soon surpass the motor vehicle
industry as the top manufacturing group in the nation. Competition
remains incredibly fierce, through rapid innovation.
</P>
<P>
   _ In bringing this case, the government undermined the basic
principle that has made this nation such an economic and consumer
success story. It is seeking to curb our freedom to innovate and to
improve our products, a principle we cannot compromise away.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there's no real mystery attached to Gates' agenda. Nor
is the government shy in dismissing his arguments. As the trial
moves to an end, atop an dozens of boxes of once highly
confidential corporate files, about the only secret left is how the
judge will rule.

VINEYARD PRICES SKYROCKET 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By TED APPEL   
 The Press Democrat, Santa Rosa, Calif.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPA, Calif. _ Despite forecasts that grape prices will soon
begin to weaken in California with new plantings starting to reach
maturity, vineyard values along the North Coast area of California
have soared to record highs as vintners continue to plant and bid
up the price of existing acreage.
</P>
<P>
   Even as experts hint that land values may be nearing a peak,
they reported that vineyard prices in the past year jumped 15
percent to 20 percent in Sonoma and Napa Counties. Meanwhile,
demand for vineyard land in the area of best-known appellations
shows no immediate signs of tapering off, several real estate
appraisers reported this week at the annual Vineyard Economics
Seminar.
</P>
<P>
   Some prices are staggering: Buyers are paying as much as
$100,000 an acre for established vineyards in the Napa Valley, said
Karl Bucher, an appraiser with Pacific Coast Appraisal Services in
St. Helena.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of qualified buyers out there who are ready to
buy,'' Bucher said. ``A lot of them have cash.''
</P>
<P>
   Napa vineyards continue to command a premium over Sonoma
vineyards. Undeveloped vineyard land in Napa sells for $37,000 to
$50,000 an acre, while an existing vineyard on phylloxera-resistant
rootstock sells for $41,000 to $100,000, Bucher said. Prices vary,
based on location, the availability of water and the ability to
build an estate home.
</P>
<P>
   In Sonoma County, undeveloped vineyard land sells for $20,000 to
$38,000 an acre, while an established vineyard planted with
resistant rootstock commands $35,000 to $57,000 an acre, said Mark
Gregg, an appraiser with Pacific Coast Appraisal Services in Santa
Rosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is as high as it has ever been,'' Gregg said. ``You have a
lot more buyers than you have properties listed for sale.''
</P>
<P>
   The market is driven by several factors, Gregg said. Wineries
are gaining confidence that demand for top-quality wines will
continue to climb. At the same time, there is a growing sense
within the wine industry that there is a limited amount of
developable land in desirable appellations. Finally, wealthy
individuals who have benefited from a strong economy want to live
among the vineyards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't expect to see vineyard prices soften over the next two
years,'' Bucher said. ``Longer term, we are going to see some
softening.''
</P>
<P>
   Although per-capita consumption of table wine is growing in the
United States, global consumption is sinking while vineyard acreage
and wine production is growing, said Barry Bedwell, president of
Allied Grape Growers, a Fresno trade group.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the challenge that confronts us,'' Bedwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Bedwell forecast that vineyard acreage in the North Coast will
grow 35 percent from 1997 to 2001 for the four major wine
varietals: chardonnay, cabernet sauvignon, merlot and zinfandel. To
absorb those grapes, vintners must increase their sales by 7
percent annually, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That seems to be a very much doable rate of growth,'' Bedwell
said. However, growers and vintners could be forced to cut prices
if they cannot boost demand for wines.
</P>
<P>
   New vineyards in the Central Valley _ where cotton farmers are
continuing to convert their fields to grapevines _ threaten to
produce a surplus of cheap wine, Bedwell said.
</P>
<P>
   North Coast growers and vintners will be protected somewhat from
volatility in prices because they specialize in producing
top-quality varietals, Bedwell said.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk wine market has slowed in recent months, an early
barometer of demand for wine, said Steven Fredricks, vice president
of Turrentine Wine Brokerage, a San Anselmo wine broker.
</P>
<P>
   Fredricks said the industry is moving into an economic cycle
where there is a ``slight excess'' of wine. He said vintners'
marketing costs are rising, growers are receiving lower prices in
some parts of California and consumers are seeing a better
selection of wine and some lower prices.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, June 20, 1999, will move Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   CONSERVATIVES-REVIEW (Undated) _ The phrase `compassionate
conservative' has been the subject of much discussion (and some
confusion) in recent days, as Republican leaders, watching George
W. Bush seek to dominate the presidential field, consider exactly
it means, and how it applies to this race: is there, for example, a
compassionate conservative view on gun control or abortion rights
or gay rights or even the nation's China policy? By Adam Nagourney.
</P>
<P>
   BALKANS-REBUILD-REVIEW (Undated) _ NATO's goal of rebuilding the
Balkans is questinable. That is because, barring the sudden
disappearance of Slobodan Milosevic, the West is proposing to
rebuild the area without rebuilding Serbia, the country at the
Balkans' heart. By Alison Smale. (`i' category)
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `a' category:
</P>
<P>
   TEST-SCORES-REVIEW (Undated) _ There are many ways for scores to
be artificially inflated, from companies marketing old tests to
outright cheating. There have even been treatises on the politics
of testing; how changing tests can lower scores when mayors are
elected or school superintendents are appointed and raise them over
the next few years so those in charge can take the credit. By
Anemona Hartocollis.
</P>
<P>
   SUPERGUN-SUBSIDY-REVIEW (Washington) _ The Pentagon is
subsidizing the civilian market for a long-range, semiautomatic
50-caliber rifle, a military weapon designed to destroy armored
vehicles and aircraft, according to Democrats on a House panel. The
Pentagon sells surplus ammunition at a discount to a West Virginia
company that markets the half-inch-thick bullets to the public via
retailers, some of whom offer the shells for sale on the Internet.
By David Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNET-DANGERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ For many computer users, the
infectious Explore worm marked the end of trust in the virtual
world. Most people already knew that it was dangerous to trust
strangers in cyberspace, just as it is in the physical world. The
worm, however, masquerading as e-mail from a friend, raised the
specter that it might no longer be possible to trust friends
either. Cyberspace, once thought of as the world's most cozy
community, has quickly become a lonely, infinite expanse where
computer outlaws programs lurk. By John Markoff.
</P>
<P>
   CHIP-IMPLANTS-REVIEW (Seattle) _ In a bizarre case that unfolded
in Boston last week, reputed mobster Vincent Marino sued to find
out whether the DEA had secretly implanted him with a microchip
tracking device. But the case may not be as strange as it sounds. A
European company already claims to have implanted at least 45
people with such chips, all either willing adults or children of
millionaires who were worried about the possibility of kidnapping.
By Sam Howe Verhovek.
</P>
<P>
   BOOKS-VIOLENCE-REVIEW (Undated) _ The defeat in Congress of a
bill making it a felony to expose children to books, movies and
video games that contain explicit sex or violence has not quelled
the debate among public and school libraries. The American Library
Association is tracking complaints from adult readers who are are
scolding librarians for the violence in books like John Steinbeck's
`Of Mice and Men' or Alvin Schwartz's `More Scary Stories to Tell
in the Dark.' By Doreen Carvajal.
</P>
<P>
   GREENSPAN-REVIEW (Washington) _ Some Fed watchers say Chairman
Alan Greenspan has been more a pragmatic opportunist than a
watchful waiter, taking clever advantage of special circumstances
like falling oil prices and spikes in productivity. Others say he
was been more lucky than good. By Michael Weinstein.
</P>
<P>
   DC-INTERNS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Congress and the White House
have produced handbooks for interns with advice about handling the
difficulties that can arise in Washington. Each was written well
before the need for such guidebooks became glaringly apparent. In
that regard, the manuals seem prescient, even wise, double
entendres notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   JOB-INTERVIEWS-TEXT-REVIEW (Undated) _ Job seekers' critical and
sometimes humorous assessments of their corporate recruiters:
quotations collected in a written survey of college seniors and
post-graduates.
</P>
<P>
   THISWEEK-REVIEW (Undated) _ Some highlights of the week.
</P>
<P>
   _ Also moving in the `i' category:
</P>
<P>
   LATIN-MILITARY-REVIEW (Rio de Janeiro) _ Latin America's armies
are down but not out. But these are trying times for soldiers
throughout the region. Government spending is declining even faster
than the prestige of a military career. In virtually every country
the armed forces confront the question of what is their role now
that they are no longer the dominant force in their societies? By
Larry Rohter.
</P>
<P>
   INDIA-PAKISTAN-REVIEW (Srinigar, Kashmir) _ In the wake of the
Kosovo, awareness is growing in Washington and other capitals that
the world pays a high price for waiting too long to address
mounting crises. The India-Pakistan dispute over Kashmir is among
the most combustible, and the fact that both contending nations
have nuclear weapons lends it an apocalyptic urgency. It is now
drawing more serious attention than at any time since it started.

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: The spirit of the 20th century
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While in our nation's capital, I made it a point to
visit the Smithsonian Aeronautics and Space Museum to pay my
respects to the inventor of the artificial heart.
</P>
<P>
   That's where you can view his airplane hanging from the ceiling,
the Spirit of St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Lest we forget, Charles A. Lindbergh, at some point after he got
through soloing the Atlantic Ocean from New York to Paris, got
around to inventing the artificial heart.
</P>
<P>
   When he demonstrated it for a couple of hundred scientists in
Europe, the astounded medical gathering predicted that history
eventually would record his flight only as an asterisk, while
remembering Lindbergh chiefly for his genius as an inventor.
</P>
<P>
   Always hard to say ahead of time what history will say.
</P>
<P>
   At the Smithsonian you also can view Dr. Robert H. Goddard's
1926 rocket, which eventually would lead to space travel. It was
Lindbergh who helped secure early funding for Dr. Goddard's private
experiments in New Mexico that went all but unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   Lindbergh could see what our own government couldn't. Goddard's
work would not be fully appreciated by Washington until after World
War II, when interrogators quizzed captured Nazi rocket scientists
on the workings of their V-1 and V-2 missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans couldn't have been more puzzled. Why not simply ask
your own Dr. Goddard, the scientists replied. That's where we got
our ideas, from studying his work.
</P>
<P>
   As for Nazis, it's hard to argue that Lindbergh was not of a
similar persuasion in a kindly sort of fashion, though he never
realized it.
</P>
<P>
   His speeches urging America to stay out of World War II were
seen as appeasement, pro-Nazi and anti-Semitic, and they often were
full of all of that. Poor Lindbergh believed he was doing what was
right for America, and was never so wrong.
</P>
<P>
   He redeemed himself after Pearl Harbor, flying some 50 combat
missions in the Pacific and even shooting down a Zero in a
dogfight, though he was officially assigned to the war zone only as
a civilian adviser.
</P>
<P>
   In the years after the war, he would fight a different kind of
world war, helping to launch the environmental movement around the
globe. Sad to say that while he was out trying to save the whales,
his wife, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, stayed home having an affair with
her psychiatrist.
</P>
<P>
   For a guy caught up in the importance of eugenics _ a pop form
of genetics that fueled a racist culture in the first half of this
century _ he ignored the fact that his wife's family had a history
of emotional illness that spanned three generations.
</P>
<P>
   But it was, of course, the kidnapping and murder of the
Lindbergh baby that shaped, if not warped, the marriage for all
their lives. His wife could not forget that Lindbergh never once
cried, even when the body was finally discovered. Such was his
stoicism.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the stuff of heroes, triumph and tragedy. And what a
triumph!
</P>
<P>
   When Columbus sailed for the New World, he was accompanied by
three ships and their crews.
</P>
<P>
   When astronaut John Glenn circled the earth, he was supported by
the finest computer technology of the day and remained in almost
constant contact with NASA ground control.
</P>
<P>
   Remember those few moments when radio contact was blacked out
during re-entry. Remember how America held its breath.
</P>
<P>
   For Lindbergh, one man in a single-engine airplane guided by
compass technology, that few moments equaled 33 hours and 30
minutes. From takeoff in New York until touchdown in Paris, he was
on his own in an undertaking fueled foremost by his personal
courage.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine his life. He knew the first man to fly an airplane. He
knew the first man to walk on the moon.
</P>
<P>
   You can read all about it in a wonderful book, ``Lindbergh,'' by
A. Scott Berg, who this year was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for
biography.
</P>
<P>
   (P.S. Lest we forget, Lindbergh did that, too, with his own
book, ``Spirit of St. Louis.'')

LUXEMBOURG AMBASSADOR TO HOST WELCOME DINNER FOR HORMEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Luxembourg's ambassador to the United States,
Arlette Conzemius, will host a dinner at her country's embassy here
to welcome gay rights advocate James C. Hormel to his new post as
U.S. envoy to Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very pleased to be able to make this gesture,''
Conzemius said in an interview Friday. ``It's a welcoming and also
a farewell because he's going to Luxembourg.''
</P>
<P>
   Hormel, who will be sworn in at a State Department ceremony June
29, will become America's first openly gay ambassador. He received
a recess appointment from President Clinton on June 4 after more
than 18 months of Senate battles over his nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Conzemius said Luxembourg's 340,000 people are not concerned
with Hormel's sexual orientation and want to proceed as if the
Senate fights ``had not interfered'' with his appointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll work with him as ambassador; there's no other issue from
this side,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Four conservative senators had put a so-called ``hold'' on
Hormel's nomination, thus blocking a vote on him, because they said
they feared he would pursue a gay agenda in the Luxembourg post.
</P>
<P>
   Hormel, a San Francisco philanthropist and heir to a meatpacking
fortune, said he would not do that. But Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott _ who has linked homosexuality to alcoholism, sex
addiction and kleptomania _ refused to lift the hold. Hormel was
said to have had the support of at least 60 of the Senate's 100
members.
</P>
<P>
   Infuriated by Clinton's action, Sen. James M. Inhofe, R-Okla.,
one of those who had put a hold on Hormel's nomination, threatened
last week to block Senate confirmation of the president's other
civilian nominees. But on Wednesday he backed off after Clinton
agreed to notify senators before they go on recess if he plans to
make another recess appointment while they are out of town.
</P>
<P>
   Conzemius said the resistance to Hormel's nomination ``was a bit
unexpected. We consider those matters private ... We hope to be a
tolerant society.''
</P>
<P>
   She noted that a new nondiscrimination law went into effect May
1 in the 15 member nations of the European Union, including
Luxembourg. The law contains a provision that says the union's
council ``may take appropriate action to combat discrimination
based on sex, racial or ethnic origin, religion or belief,
disability, age or sexual orientation.''
</P>
<P>
   Conzemius said guests at the dinner will include Hormel's family
and friends as well as members of Congress from California who
supported his nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Hormel's partner, Timothy Wu, was invited, Conzemius
said she could not divulge the guest list. But she added that
accepting Wu ``is not a problem for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to make this very smooth and very normal,'' said
Conzemius, a career diplomat who arrived at the Washington embassy
last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Conzemius also declined to reveal the date of the dinner but
said it would be before Hormel is sworn in. The menu, she said,
would provide a ``summerlike meal with a French flair,'' including
a cold soup, salad with fish and a main course of meat.
</P>
<P>
   Hormel and Conzemius met at the embassy last week and discussed,
among other items, an American art exhibit headed to Luxembourg.
She said she found him ``motivated, interested in doing positive
work and very charming.''
</P>
<P>
   Hormel, 66, is divorced and has five children and 13
grandchildren. He has said that Wu, who trains people to be
fundraisers for nonprofit organizations, will remain in San
Francisco and will not live with him in Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
   Conzemius said she is looking forward to having the
ambassadorial post filled. It has been vacant since Hormel's
predecessor, Clay Constantinou of West Orange, N.J., left in
January. Constantinou is a lawyer, a former state finance chairman
of the Democratic Party and a former trustee of the Democratic
National Committee.

THE WEB REWRITES THE RULES ON CUSTOMER SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every so often, corporations rededicate themselves to the idea
of ``customer service.'' This usually occurs immediately after a
sharp downturn in earnings. The boss needs something to say and
someone to blame. Promising better customer service beats
confessing that senior management is clueless.
</P>
<P>
   Most senior managers think of customer service as playing client
golf on a weekday afternoon. The idea that companies have to be
responsive to the people who buy their products _ that they
actually have to interact with them _ is so foreign to their sense
of order and hierarchy that the mere thought of it gives them the
willies.
</P>
<P>
   In an idealized corporate world, customers simply buy the
product and go away. Anything beyond that involves time and money
that could be more profitably expended elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   One of the true horrors of the Internet is that it makes
customer service an essential component of successful business. In
the good old days _ five years ago _ customer service was
invisible; an unflappable voice on the other end of an 800 number,
a letter in the mail explaining some foul-up.
</P>
<P>
   Today, customer service is the front line of e-commerce. It
involves not just transactional success, but a company's brand
image as well. How well it works determines how a company is
perceived. If it doesn't work, the effects are immediate and
profound.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the on-line auction house eBay learned this lesson
the hard way. EBay's computers crashed, rendering its site
inoperative for 22 hours. Over the course of the next few days, the
company lost $4 billion in market capitalization and watched in
horror as some of its best customers double-clicked to Amazon.com's
and Yahoo's auction services.
</P>
<P>
   Big disasters like eBay's computer crash happen irregularly. But
little disasters take place every day and have real consequences.
Consider the following personal experiences.
</P>
<P>
   I recently became eligible for the Boston Globe Employee
Association's 401(k) plan. I was happy about this, since it allowed
me the opportunity to shelter 8 percent of my income. I was also
happy about this because Putnam Investments manages the BGEA 401(k)
plan. I know that Putnam is a first-rate investment firm. I filled
out the forms, making a point of giving Putnam my e-mail address as
well as my postal address. Two weeks later, I received a letter
from Putnam that said: ``Your personal identification number is
1234.'' Nothing else. Not: ``Thanks very much for your business, we
really appreciate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not: ``What else can we do for you?'' Just: ``Here's your
number.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of this transaction, I now think less of Putnam
Investments. I am the definition of a good customer (whom Putnam is
theoretically devoted to) because I am willing to give them, every
week, 8 percent of my income. One would think Putnam would be all
over me, with e-mails and updates and newsletters and
recommendations and research reports, in an effort to get more of
my business. But Putnam doesn't think of me as their client; they
think the BGEA, an affiliate of the Newspaper Guild, is their
client. That's not what I expect from a company to whom I give 8
percent of my income.
</P>
<P>
   I expect that because that is what the Internet does; it makes
me think I'm important. And that is what the Internet does for the
50 million Americans who use it; it makes them think that companies
that offer services work for them.
</P>
<P>
   If I could, I would leave Putnam tomorrow and walk across the
street to Wellington or Fidelity. I probably can't, because the
BGEA doesn't offer its members a choice. But eventually it will,
because it must (unions that don't offer its members a choice
probably won't survive in the new economy). And when it does, I'm
out of Putnam. I don't want any part of a company that doesn't
``get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Weirdly enough, companies that you would never expect to ``get
it,'' do. General Motors recently launched a car-buying service on
the Internet. I have a car lease that soon expires, so I have been
going to the Web to check out my options. Last weekend, I inquired
about two GM products. Within two days, I had seven e-mails from
five different GM dealerships, all of them ``on the case.'' One guy
in Long Island said he would drive the car to me for a test drive.
</P>
<P>
   A brand I thought was great _ Putnam _ I now think is brain
dead. A brand I thought was brain dead _ GM _ I now think is great.
That's a big change in three weeks' time. Multiply my own
experience 50 million times and you get some sense of the
importance of Internet-based customer service.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that don't ``get'' this change will find their best
customers double-clicking away. Customer service is no longer about
lip service. It's now the leading edge of brand management.
Corporations that understand this will be the major brands of the
new economy.

 &HT;    Century drawing to a close on a note of high praise for
prolific, unrivaled jazz master Ellington
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, June 20.
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the next-to-last year of the 20th century belongs to any
American artist, it belongs to Duke Ellington.
</P>
<P>
   And he's having a timely centennial celebration to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Which, thanks to our national passion for pre-millennial
retrospection, means that the all-embracing composer may finally be
getting full due for his unparalleled achievements.
</P>
<P>
   Here's one major example: Though he led his first band at age 18
and didn't stop until his death at age 75 in 1974, Ellington only
this year won a Pulitzer Prize.
</P>
<P>
   The posthumous award was better late than never, even if it
smacked of arbitrary atonement. What Edward Kennedy Ellington did
was simply too massive, too singular and too influential to be
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the firstest with the mostest,'' says Phil Schaap, a
Grammy Award-winning record producer, music historian and jazz
radio host for New York's WKCR-FM, who is producing a series of
historic Ellington reissues for the Sony Legacy label. ``He wrote
tunes, tunes with lyrics, blues, extended forms, opera, ballet,
Broadway shows, movie soundtracks, concertos, piano concertos,
individual concertos for band members. There is an element here
that is otherwise not captured in jazz, a prolific nature that
isn't rivaled. You'd have to turn to somebody like Bach.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta audiences can get a taste of that unrivaled nature
today, when the African-American Philharmonic Jazz Orchestra gives
a free concert at the Auburn Avenue Research Library, and Saturday,
when the Duke Ellington Jazz Orchestra visits Chastain Park
Amphitheatre, playing a benefit concert for the National Black Arts
Festival. The latter group, a 15-piece ensemble conducted by Duke's
grandson Paul Mercer Ellington, is what's known as a ``ghost
band.'' Like orchestras once led by Count Basie, Sun Ra and Charles
Mingus, it will strive to sustain the spirit of its namesake, even
though its swing can never mean precisely the same thing as it did
in 1919 or 1927 or 1942 or 1956 or 1973.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you compare anybody to Duke Ellington?'' asks Rocky
White, who joined the band as its drummer not long before
Ellington's death. ``Paul's learning the business, learning his
way. It wouldn't be fair to compare him to his dad (Mercer
Ellington). The one constant is Duke Ellington's music.''
</P>
<P>
   The band's tour is but one of many musical tributes in this
summer of Ellingtonia:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra, featuring trumpeter Wynton
Marsalis, is on a world tour playing Duke's tunes _
</P>
<P>
   one facet of its parent organization's yearlong Ellington
salute, which includes everything from
</P>
<P>
   a national high school band
</P>
<P>
   competition to PBS specials and Manhattan street parades.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  On Monday, trumpeter Terence Blanchard performs the master's
soundtrack to ``Anatomy of a Murder'' at a public screening of the
1959 film in New York's Bryant Park.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Saxophonist David Murray is touring with a program devoted to
the ``obscure works'' of Ellington and his longtime collaborator,
Billy Strayhorn.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  The 24-CD set ``The Duke Ellington Centennial Edition: The
Complete RCA Victor Recordings, 1927-1973'' arrived in late April,
at once the biggest reissue package ever distributed by a jazz
label and the ultimate totem for obsessive fans willing to spend
$400.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  With more than 200 titles in print already, Ellington also has
a box set _ ``The Duke'' _ coming out in August on Sony Legacy (a
mere three CDs) and batches of individual re-releases that boast
improved mastering and previously unheard material.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the beginning of a real, ongoing thing,'' says Valerie
Capers, a New York-based pianist and educator who straddles
classical and jazz worlds on her new album, ``Wagner Takes the `A'
Train.'' ``He will really take his place in history in a monumental
way.''
</P>
<P>
   How monumental, exactly, is mind-boggling. Historian Schaap
masterminded a 24-hour-a-day radio broadcast of Ellington that
began April 20, a week before Ellington's 100th birthday, and
concluded 13 days later. Surely the vaults were exhausted?
</P>
<P>
   ``We played roughly 10 percent of what we had,'' Schaap says.
</P>
<P>
   Ellington produced so much because he never stopped producing.
Over a span of more than 50 years, he was able to maintain and
compose for a band of usually first-rate musicians who were always
in his employ. His orchestra, as is often said, was his instrument,
and he composed with the individual sounds of specific players in
mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the history of jazz since World War II, I only know of five
or six ensembles that were able to stay on the road and tour 200
nights a year,'' says Rob Gibson, executive producer and director
of Jazz at Lincoln Center. ``John Coltrane didn't do that. Miles
Davis didn't do that. Duke Ellington had years when he was on the
road 300 nights a year. That's an astonishing achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   What made it work was Ellington's incarnation of something
otherwise mythic: He was the total artist, as populist as he was
avant-garde, as entertaining as he was subversive. His stature as a
creative genius is secured by universal appeal. People who agree on
little else can easily agree on Ellington, even when they take
different lessons from his example. New York pianist Matthew Shipp,
recently featured in Downbeat magazine as part of a new generation
of players shaping the future of jazz, cites Duke as an inspiration
even on his most abstract pieces. While others might look to the
virtuoso tradition of Art Tatum, Shipp considers Ellington the
father of modern jazz piano, the square root from which sprang
Thelonious Monk and then Mal Waldron, Cecil Taylor, McCoy Tyner,
Randy Weston and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can feel him, when he's playing the piano, constantly
smelling and tasting overtones, the harmonies and colors,'' Shipp
says. ``He's totally like a child in the joy that he got in seeing
just how far he could extend certain harmonies, the relativities of
note choices. He was operating on so many levels, but sometimes a
short introduction to a tune, in and of itself, is a whole musical
statement.''
</P>
<P>
   The beauty of Ellington's gift, in a world where either/or
choices are the norm, is that it always offered a both/and
proposition. Listeners can take pleasure in the microcosmic
details. As Shipp observes, ``He has a way of wringing his wrist
that gets a bell-like quality out of chords that's very unique.''
Or they can sing along, swept up in melodies sturdy and lyrical
enough to last into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's something that separates Ellington from other
composers in jazz,'' Gibson says. ``He has `It Don't Mean a Thing
(If It Ain't Got That Swing),' `Do Nothing 'Til You Hear From Me,'
`In a Sentimental Mood,' `Prelude to a Kiss,' `Perdido,' `Beginning
to See the Light,' `Sophisticated Lady.' . . . Even if people can't
necessarily hum the melody to it, they kind of know the song. He
was a force in this century.''

ANIMANIACS TAKE PLAYERS THROUGH MOVIE SET 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LONNIE BROWN   
 Lakeland, Fla., Ledger   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In early 1998, I reviewed a kids' software game: Animaniacs'
Game Pack. It was a collection of five games featuring the
Animaniacs _ three cartoon characters from Warner Bros.
</P>
<P>
   It was software with a sense of humor, and even though geared
toward the 8-and-up mind, an adult with an aversion to Barney the
Dinosaur could delight in a slapstick put-down titled ``Baloney's
Balloon Bob.''
</P>
<P>
   The Animaniacs are back. SouthPeak Interactive's Animaniacs: A
Gigantic Adventure (Windows; about $20) is a side-scrolling
adventure that takes players through the fictional movie set
``Gigantic.'' (Think luxury liner and you'll have the idea.)
</P>
<P>
   Players help Yakko, Wakko and Dot evade Thaddeus J. Plotz and
his henchmen, who are trying to destroy old films and movie posters
on the Warner Bros. Studio's back lot.
</P>
<P>
   There are 11 different levels that can be played on three levels
of difficulty. Players can play on an Internet mode (two to four
players can compete against one another on MSN Gaming Zone) or two
players can take turns at the computer trying to score the most
points.
</P>
<P>
   Players start out on the Bridge level of the Gigantic. It's
basically a learning level where players find out how the game
works and what they're expected to do.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, Baloney, from the previous Animaniacs' CD, appears
in this game too. He's one of the characters the Animaniacs must
defeat. His attack mode: He'll hug you to death.

   RECOMMENDED RECORDINGS
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Where to start: Taste has a lot to do with this question.
Because Ellington's career passed through so many stages, new
listeners may want to consider the kind of Ellington they'd most
enjoy. Though, obviously, he's remembered for his orchestra, all of
Duke's music begins at the piano. ``Money Jungle'' (1962, Blue
Note), a meeting with modern titans Charles Mingus and Max Roach,
makes a gentle argument for delicacy, the chime and glimmer of
Ellington's piano underpinning melodies that are heartbreakingly
lyrical. A more standard recommendation is ``The Blanton-Webster
Band'' (1942/1986, RCA), a three-CD set that documents what many
consider to be Ellington's finest band (with bassist Jimmy Blanton
and tenor saxophonist Ben Webster) and the influence of composing
partner Billy Strayhorn. The collection illustrates the magic
Ellington could work even within the three-minute song form.
Included are ``Jack the Bear,'' ``Never No Lament,'' ``Harlem Air
Shaft,'' ``In a Mellotone,'' ``Warm Valley,'' ``I Got It Bad (And
That Ain't Good),'' ``Main Stem'' and ``Perdido.'' RCA will reissue
the set later this year with improved sound.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  What's next: Snatch up the revised/reissued ``Ellington at
Newport 1956 (Complete)'' (Columbia/
</P>
<P>
   Legacy), which captures the explosive concert that signaled
Ellington's late-'50s ``comeback'' and nearly sparked a riot. The
two-CD set boasts 100 minutes of new material. It presents, for the
first time in stereo, the actual concert as it happened, with the
studio material that originally substituted for the real deal. The
audio is thrilling: The audience, gone berserk after Paul
Gonsalves' legendary 27 choruses on ``Dimuendo and Crescendo in
Blue,'' refuses to let the band leave the stage. So Duke wisely
decides to keep playing, even as promoter George Wein shouts at
him, ``No! No! No!'' Producer Phil Schaap's liner notes tell the
whole story behind one of the most notorious concerts in jazz
history.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Boxed bonanza: Completists will dip into the stocking fund for
``The Duke Ellington Centennial Edition: The Complete RCA Victor
Recordings 1927-1973'' (RCA). List price is $407.52 for this
limited edition set, which spans Duke's career, from the band he
led at the Cotton Club during the Harlem Renaissance to his
latter-day masterpiece ``The Far East Suite.'' The surplus of bonus
tracks can be a boon to the obsessive, though an annoyance to
listeners who prefer to simply hear an album. The package, which
includes a 128-page book and a red clothbound box, is gorgeous. It
is widely discounted. Last week, the Internet retailer CD Now
(www.cdnow.com) was selling it for $285.58 (plus shipping). A
simpler three-CD survey, ``The Duke,'' is due Aug. 10 from
Columbia/Legacy.

 &HT;    From `Rough Beast' to polished `Frederick'
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, June 20.
 &HT;    By Judith Green
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frederick the Great is an unlikely hero for an opera _ but no
more so than the creators of an opera about the 18th-century
Prussian military genius that receives its premiere this week at
Clayton College &AMP; State University in Morrow.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Corse, a professor of English and director of theater at
Clayton State, wrote the music for this three-act work. It's not
the first opera by the 59-year-old composer, but it is the longest
and most complex of his ventures into music-theater.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Fairchild, 29, who wrote the libretto, is a former student
of Corse's who graduated from Oglethorpe University and just
completed his master of fine arts in playwriting at the University
of Georgia. An Army brat whose father had three tours of duty in
Germany, Fairchild has a strong interest in German history, which
has provided the raw material for nearly all his plays.
</P>
<P>
   They range from ``What Rough Beast Slouches,'' about Kaiser
Wilhelm II, to ``Three Weeks,'' about the Berlin Olympics of 1936,
to ``Second-Hand Hagiology,'' his thesis play at UGA, about a group
home for dead saints (displaced from bombed churches in Wiesbaden)
and a gaggle of American Army wives who want to turn the home into
a thrift shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swear the next thing I write will be about America,''
Fairchild says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frederick Hohenzollern,'' Corse and Fairchild's opera, has its
roots in ``Rough Beast,'' which was produced at Clayton State and
at the 14th Street Playhouse in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its title (from a poem by William Butler Yeats), ``Rough
Beast'' is a drama about Wilhelm's friendship or love affair with
his diplomatic adviser, Count Philipp Eulenburg, who was hounded
from court after a journalist attacked their relationship. In the
play, Eulenburg reminds the monarch that their closeness is not the
first of its kind in the German royal family.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gives a speech that tells the story of this opera,'' Corse
said. ``And I told Brad: `This is what I've been looking for.'''
</P>
<P>
   That was almost four years ago. Corse wrote some preliminary
music, including an overture, that has since been dumped. Last
spring, both felt spurred to finish the opera, which they completed
in about three months.
</P>
<P>
   Corse, who has undergraduate and master's degrees in music from
North Texas State University, where he studied with Samuel Adler,
has written shorter operas. As might be expected, all have literary
sources: a one-act called ``The Open Window,'' from a story by H.H.
Munro (a.k.a. Saki); another called ``Ligeia,'' from a story by
Edgar Allan Poe. He's written ``quasi-cabaret music'' for
Fairchild's ``Three Weeks,'' and they've also collaborated on a
children's musical based on Rudyard Kipling's ``Just So Stories,''
which has been given at Spivey Hall for school-age audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've never done anything of this scale,'' Corse says of
``Frederick.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to a grant from Info Basics of Atlanta and student
activity fees, the premiere is sung by a largely professional cast.
The conductor is William Whitefield of New York, the stage director
David Z. Saltz of the University of Georgia faculty. The scenic
projections and the expressive poster design are by Suloni
Robertson, an artist from Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The singers include baritone H. Brent Weaver, faculty composer
at Clayton State, as Frederick's repressive father, Frederick
William I, and soprano Cheryl Boyd-Waddell, a voice teacher at
Clayton State, as his mother, Sophia.
</P>
<P>
   Soprano Wendy Baker, who sings the role of Frederick's sister,
and tenor Lee Compton, who sings Frederick as an old man, are both
members of the Atlanta Opera chorus.
</P>
<P>
   Tenor Victor Floyd, who sings the young Frederick, is an
affiliate artist at Emory University and music director at North
Decatur Presbyterian Church; and baritone Jay Beadle, who sings the
roleto C.P.E. Bach's father, Johann Sebastian Bach, with a request
for a set of variations. The result was Bach's late masterpiece,
``The Musical Offering.'' The final duet of ``Frederick
Hohenzollern'' is based on that tune.

AN EX-TRADER ROLLS THE DICE HAPPILY, IN LAS VEGAS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 20) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.J., Nev.)   (af)  
 By LAURA PEDERSEN-PIETERSEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As Woody Allen tells it, his father was replaced at work by a
machine that could do everything better and faster than he did. So
then Woody's mother said she wanted to buy one, too.
</P>
<P>
   Don't laugh. Peter J. LaBadia has also felt the anguish of being
replaced by a machine, though his wife, Beverly, has no intention
of replacing him. In the 1980s, LaBadia was pulling down $250,000 a
year as a floor broker at the American Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Then computers were installed so that orders could be executed
electronically, and his commissions dropped below the cost of
leasing a seat. ``It started costing me money to go to work,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, at 50, he left Wall Street and, with another former
broker, bought a printing business in central New Jersey. But after
three decades of swapping stocks and options in fractions while
frantically throwing hand signals to clerks in the balcony, LaBadia
found that printing overlapped with neither his experience nor his
interests. He missed the action and camaraderie of the stock
exchange.
</P>
<P>
   He has found all that again _ and more _ in Las Vegas. After
moving to Nevada a year ago, he enrolled in a seven-week course at
PCI Dealer School, where he learned to deal blackjack and craps,
oversee a gambling table and pay off on bets. On his first day out
of school, he was hired full-time to run a craps table at the El
Cortez Casino in downtown Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Having lived for many years within driving distance of Atlantic
City, LaBadia was not exactly unfamiliar with gambling. He and his
wife had often made day trips to Harrah's there, usually to play
blackjack. Though by no means a big bettor, he tended to win a bit
more than he lost.
</P>
<P>
   His new starting salary is just $24,000, but it takes only a few
months for someone with good skills to move up. Dealers at top
casinos like Harrah's, the Mirage and Caesar's can make $60,000 a
year and qualify for health and retirement benefits.
</P>
<P>
   LaBadia hasn't read a shelf-full of career advice manuals. But
his intuition has led him to the pith of their recommendations:
Assess your skills and your passions _ then see them in a new
light. And he has clearly found a way to harness his Wall Street
acumen in a different venue.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the exchange,'' he said, ``I did a lot of math very quickly
in my head and kept track of a big deck of orders and listened to
four different conversations at the same time.'' At the craps
table, he must keep track of bets, chips, points and dice and keep
things flowing smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   In his new setting, the gregarious LaBadia (known to ask his
bank teller for ``10s, 20s and an 8-by-10 glossy of yourself'')
still feels right at home.
</P>
<P>
   The road from high finance to the world of high rollers is not
one-way. As fast as computers eliminate jobs in the financial
markets, they create other types of jobs. Consider all those hired
to operate the on-line trading systems and investor Web sites _ not
to mention on-line gambling sites.
</P>
<P>
   And while downsized back-office clerks and floor brokers don't
necessarily end up in Las Vegas or Atlantic City, there are enough
parallels between the Street and the Strip to encourage crossover.
</P>
<P>
   Several options traders at the American Stock Exchange boast of
having been asked to stop playing blackjack at casinos for what is
called ``counting cards'' _ keeping track of what has been dealt.
And the Amex is home to a number of poker aficionados, champion
bridge and backgammon players and a current international chess
grandmaster, Ronald W. Henley.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to use numbers and judge people, of course, proves
valuable in many games. Warren E. Buffett and Bill Gates, for
example, like to play bridge.
</P>
<P>
   As Michael Rosenberg, a 1994 world bridge champion and a current
Amex options trader, explained: ``It's all about looking for value.
You get value when you know how to determine if the probability is
in your favor and then how to act on it.'' You have to have a
system for playing cards, he said, adding, ``it also helps to be
able to read people's faces _ the poker players are best at that.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Rosenberg doesn't exactly view trading options on Wall
Street as a job. ``It's fun,'' he said. ``Of course, you
occasionally get a run of bad luck. But the same sort of thing
happens in bridge.''
</P>
<P>
   While casinos are proud of the financial credentials of dealers
like LaBadia, brokerage firms don't want investing linked in the
public mind with gambling. A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons declined to allow
one of its stockbrokers, who used to deal high-stakes poker at
Harrah's (a player needed $10,000 just to sit down at her table),
to be quoted for this article.
</P>
<P>
   Back in Las Vegas, LaBadia said working the casinos actually has
several advantages, among them the absence of personal financial
risks. ``I sleep better not worrying about market crashes,'' he
said.

after Serb forces pulled out of the region. (Stephen Crowley/New

 &HT;    MILITARY FAMILIES FRET OVER MEDICAL COVERAGE FOR 'CUSTODIAL
CARE'
 &HT;    For release Sunday, June 20.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH and SCOTT MONTGOMERY
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Jackie Lichnock is a chief petty officer's wife who
has waged a long, pitched battle with tje Pentagon over its
reluctance to pay for the medical care doctors have prescribed for
her dangerously ill son.
</P>
<P>
   When Christopher was born, his skull had prematurely hardened,
leaving too little room for his brain to develop. Doctors removed
the top of his skull, but significant brain damage already had
occurred, and he came home from the hospital with only part of a
skull and a life expectajcy of a weec.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher has defied his grim prognosis, and his mother has
successfully fought off attempts to deny him the medical coverage
to which she is convinced he is entitled.
</P>
<P>
   But Lichnock and others like her fear the Pentagon is on the
verge of picking up a powerful ally in its efforts to contest their
claims: Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Without debate, the House and Senate passed companion measures
</P>
<P>
   that, according to military family advncates, support the Defense
Department's contention that patients with no hope of recovery can
be relegatad to uncovered ``custodial care.'' Even if the patient's
condition requires skilled medical care, Pentagon health benefits
can be denied.
</P>
<P>
   If the provisions ultimately become law, many active-duty
families and military retirees will be in danger of being forced to
turn to Ledicaid or other coverage for the care.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a disgrace,'' said retired Army Col. Charles
Partridge, legislative counsel for the National Association for
Uniformed Services.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, the two tiny provisions folded into the massive
$288 billion defense budget appear simply to extend skilled
services such as home nursing to a select group of 25 persons.
</P>
<P>
   But Partridge and other military family advocates fear that by
declaring this group an ``exception'' to Pentagon policy, the
legislation will solidify that policy for all other military
families.
</P>
<P>
   In a response to written questions, the Pentagon stated that the
secretary of defense can waive limitations on ``custodial care''
benefits. However, officials did not respond to the charges by
Partridge and others.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is the unusual definition of the term ``custodial
care'' used by Tricare, the Defense Department's health care
program. The term usually means provision of only such basics as
dressing, bathing and feeding, but the Pentagon, through Tricare,
expands the definition to include skilled medical care if that care
can't be expected to improve the patient's long-term condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``A custodial care determination is not precluded by the fact
that a patient is under the care of a supervising or an attending
physician and that services are being ordered and prescribed to
support and generally maintain the patient's condition,'' according
to the Tricare manual on the Defense Department's Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   For Christopher Lichnock, that means the constant suctioning of
fluid from the tracheotomy tube in his throat isn't covered
because, even though only trained nurses can do the procedure, it
does not improve his chances of recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department has lost two federal court cases in which
Tricare beneficiaries argued that this is a unique and harsh
definition of custodial care that never has received congressional
approval.
</P>
<P>
   In voting to supply continued coverage for 25 Tricare
beneficiaries who have participated for several years in a
``demonstration program,'' Congress would inadvertently provide
that approval, said Charles M. Loeser, a lawyer in one of the two
cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a 'stealth' law,'' said Loeser, of South Bend, Ind.
``On its face, it appears to allow benefits to be extended. In
reality, its purpose is to defend against future lawsuits.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Hickey of the National Military Family Association said
the bill is a ``subterfuge'' that is part of a Pentagon effort to
dump these families into the Medicaid system.
</P>
<P>
   ``What it would actually do is not spelled out in any way, shape
or form,'' said Hickey, who is the associate director for
government relations with the group. ``And the language used
actually disguises what it does.''
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how many active duty families and retirees would be
affected if the provision became part of the final defense
authorization bill.
</P>
<P>
   However, Carrie Sapp, an Oklahoma woman whose special-needs
child has been designated a ``custodial care'' case, said she
personally knew of more than 12.
</P>
<P>
   Sapp and Lichnock, who lives in Jacksonville, Fla., came to
Washington this month to tell members of Congress and their staffs
about problems they were having with Tricare. The two women said
they also asked in a meeting with Tricare officials how many
military families are affected by the custodial care policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They told us they had no idea,'' Sapp said.
</P>
<P>
   She said Tricare case managers use the threat of being declared
a custodial case ``as a tool to make you do what they want you to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the doctor orders 24 hours of nursing care a day, the case
manager will say something like, 'Well, we can approve 16 hours a
day, but if it goes over that we're going to have to look at
custodial care.' Then you take what you can get and the doctor
takes whatever he can get for you,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Though both the House and Senate have passed budget bills
containing the custodial care provisions, the two budgets differ
slightly and must be merged into a single piece of legislation that
requires another vote before being sent to President Clinton for
his signature.
</P>
<P>
   Hickey's group is working with a coalition of military
organizations to pressure Congress to reword the Tricare language
when a conference committee melds the two budgets when it meets
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to do this, fine,'' Hickey said. ``But by God, I
want it in black and white so everybody knows exactly what they've
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Lichnock will wait to see how this turns out. Within days
of returning from her trip to Washington to lobby Congress on
Tricare, she was notified that her son had been declared
``custodial'' and would soon go from 16 hours of nursing care six
days a week, plus another eight hours on Sunday, to one hour of
skilled nursing each day and a single doctor's visit each month.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly at the same time, Lichnock's pleas were heard by Rep.
Tillie Fowler, a Republican from Jacksonville, who set up a meeting
with her Florida staff to discuss the case. After going over
Christopher's nursing notes, kept by caregivers detailing the type
of medical attention he requires, Tricare officials in that meeting
agreed to provide 24-hour nursing care through November, when his
case will be re-evaluated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the doctor ordered originally,'' Lichnock said.
``But, yes, we expect a battle again (in November). I don't trust
them for nothing.''

PANEL SEEKS TO OUTLAW INTERNET GAMBLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Warning that adolescents are more likely than
adults to become addicted to gambling, a federal commission
recommended Friday that wagering over the Internet be outlawed and
that states raise the minimum age for placing bets to 21.
</P>
<P>
   The National Gambling Impact Study Commission estimates that
about 85 percent of people ages 12 to 18 have gambled at least once
in their lives and that about 15 percent of those are either heavy
gamblers or are addicted to gambling. Among adults, as many as 7
percent of gamblers are believed to have a problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``These statistics forewarn of even more serious
gambling-related problems in the future,'' said James C. Dobson, a
member of the commission.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, whose recommendations were unanimously supported
by all nine members, sees the Internet as a particular threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gambling on the Internet is especially enticing to youth,
(addicted) gamblers and criminals,'' the report said. ``There are
currently no mechanisms in place to prevent youth _ who make up the
largest percentage of Internet users _ from using their parents'
credit card numbers to register and set up accounts for use at
Internet gambling sites.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission also recommended that states and schools form
prevention programs for adolescents and remind them that sports
betting is illegal. The commission found that betting on sports
``may act as a gateway to other forms of gambling.''
</P>
<P>
   The 300-page report discusses the positive and negative aspects
of legalized gambling and it includes a list of more than 70
recommendations. It will be sent to Congress, the White House,
Native American tribal governments and state governors.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the commission's research was conducted by the National
Research Council, part of the National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, whose members included representatives of the
casino industry, was appointed by a bipartisan group of lawmakers
in 1996. Dobson is president of the conservative group Focus on the
Family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm deeply disturbed by the impact of gambling on individuals,
on families and on communities,'' said Kay James, chairwoman of the
commission.
</P>
<P>
   Gambling is a $50 billion annual industry that is permitted in
some form in 47 states. It includes commercial and Indian
reservation casinos, slot machines, state lotteries and horse- and
dog-track betting. In 1973 only eight states had lotteries and one
state, Nevada, had casinos.
</P>
<P>
   Current laws do not address gambling over the Internet, the
newest forum for placing bets that transcends state and national
boundaries. Federal law makes placing a bet or sending gambling
information over telephone lines illegal, but the 1961 law predates
the Internet. Most computer users connect to the Internet through
phone lines but it is also possible to use cable television lines
and satellites, technically skirting the law.
</P>
<P>
   The report did not delve into how U.S. regulators would control
Internet gambling sites located overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The gambling commission estimates that 6.9 million people
gambled over the Internet in 1997 and 14.5 million people did so in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular form of wagering on the Internet is sports
betting, but casino-type games are becoming more popular as
Internet connections become faster.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation is pending in the Senate that would ban placing
wagers over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., said he would also propose legislation
that would prohibit Internet gambling and include the other
recommendations made by the commission. He is the author of the
legislation that created the gambling commission.
</P>
<P>
   But pro-gambling lawmakers have vowed to fight any effort to
impose new federal restrictions on state-approved gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gambling is already well-regulated by the states,'' said Rep.
Shelley Berkley, D-Nev., whose district includes Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The report's recommendations are not binding unless they are
enacted into law. Among other things, the gambling commission
recommends that state governments consider a moratorium on future
expansion of gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Commission members admitted that they don't expect many of their
recommendations to actually become law but said the report would
serve to educate policy-makers and the public about the downside of
gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the state legislator who has to decide whether to expand
or restrict gambling activity, hopefully the statistics we
collected ... will be helpful,'' James said. ``This report and the
debate is has already created will increase the amount of
information available.''

RECOGNITION OF `JUNETEENTH' IS SPREADING 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CINNAMON BAIR   
 The Ledger, Lakeland, Fla.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On June 19, 1865, Union Gen. Gordon Granger and his troops
arrived in Galveston, Texas, with news that the Civil War was over
and all slaves were free.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time blacks in Texas had heard of the
Emancipation Proclamation, signed more than two years before by
President Abraham Lincoln. Consequently, they became the last
slaves to be freed in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Upon word of their freedom, jubilant celebrations erupted among
blacks throughout the state. The date came to be known as
``Juneteenth,'' an independence day for blacks.
</P>
<P>
   What began as a localized celebration 134 years ago has become a
national phenomenon today. Festivities are planned in nearly every
state. Three _ Texas, Oklahoma and Iowa _ recognize the day as a
holiday. And more celebrations are sprouting up around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly spreading and growing rapidly,'' said Cliff
Robinson, creator of Juneteenth.com, an online database of
Juneteenth activities around the country. ``There's a lot of cities
starting celebrations.''
</P>
<P>
   Juneteenth is recognized as the oldest holiday celebrating black
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of four black holidays gaining prominence nationwide,
including Kwanzaa, which takes place Dec. 26 through Jan. 1; Martin
Luther King Jr. Day, which occurs on the third Monday in January;
and Overcome, which occurs about the time of the Jewish holiday of
Passover each spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a symbol of hope and a symbol of freedom,'' said Michael
Woodward, a graduate student of history who works at the Black
Archives Museum in Tallahassee, Fla. ``It's a day of
reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
   Officially, all slaves were freed by Lincoln when he signed the
Emancipation Proclamation during the Civil War. That document was
supposed to take effect Jan. 1, 1863.
</P>
<P>
   But the Civil War raged on until May 26, 1865, and the last
vestiges of slavery were not removed until the slaves in Texas
received word of their freedom on June 19, 1865. So that became the
date to celebrate slavery's final eradication in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   It could be thought of as the end of the independence movement
in the United States, said Morning Sunday Hettleman of the National
Juneteenth Museum. The United States fought for and received its
freedom from Britain starting on July 4, 1776. Slaves received
theirs on June 19, 1865.
</P>
<P>
   And Juneteenth is for more than just blacks, Hettleman said.
Freedom from slavery was won thanks to Americans of all creeds and
colors, not just blacks. And it meant that no person, regardless of
race, creed or religion, would be forced to work for another person
for free.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juneteenth is not just about the black experience,'' said
Hettleman, whose online museum can be found at
www.x-change.com/juneteenth/. ``It's about the American experience.
It's about `e pluribus unum,' '' she said, referring to the Latin
phrase meaning ``out of the many, one.''
</P>
<P>
   The celebration, which originally spread as blacks migrated from
Texas to other parts of the country, has experienced a resurgence
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really is on an upswing now,'' Robinson said. ``A lot of
people are learning about it for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the recent increased interest in the holiday is
attributed to advances in civil rights that have caused blacks to
reflect on their own history.
</P>
<P>
   ``As we have time to reflect now, we recognize the importance of
this historical event,'' Hettleman said. ``I think as we move into
the 21st century is when we're going to recognize how important our
past is.''

STEAL THIS BOOK! SOME DO  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Colo., Ore. Mass.)   By JOYCE JENSEN

<P>
   ``If I were asked what book is better than a cheap book, I
should answer that there is one book better than a cheap book, and
that is a book honestly come by.'' James Russell Lowell, poet and
editor (first editor of The Atlantic Monthly), testifying before
the United States Senate Committee on Patents on Jan. 29, 1886.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for many bookstore owners, that is not a sentiment
shared by all of the people who visit their stores.
</P>
<P>
   If the preferences of the book-buying public show up in the form
of a best-seller list, then what of the picks of the book-stealing
public? Arts &AMP; Ideas decided to sample the taste of homegrown book
thieves in an extremely unscientific survey.
</P>
<P>
   Many bookstore owners were reluctant even to acknowledge theft.
(The super bookstore chains like Barnes &AMP; Noble and Borders
declined to make any comment at all.) But among the shops that did
respond, their thieves had remarkably similar tastes. Whether the
West Coast or the East, the Beat poets Jack Kerouac, Charles
Bukowski, Allen Ginsberg and William Burroughs kept popping up as
favorites among shoplifters. (In Britain, The Economist surveyed
booksellers and similarly found that the Beat poet Jack Kerouac had
the No. 1 slot.) Tight behind the Beats, comes the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   At Ventura Bookstore in Ventura, Ca., Kerouac's ``On the Road''
and Ginsberg's ``Howl!'' are at the top of the most-wanted lists as
well as that old favorite, Abbie Hoffman's ``Steal This Book,''
said Ed Elrod, the owner. Tarot cards and how-to books,
particularly sex manuals, are also popular. Even Bibles get taken,
which Elrod says he thinks are used for marriage ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Berman, manager of the historic City Lights bookstore in
North Beach in San Francisco, said that Kerouac, Burroughs and
Ginsberg are the most popular writers to take. It may be a younger
generation of thieves interested in Douglas Coupland's Generation X
books as well.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Millemann, a general manager of the Tattered Cover in
Denver, one of the largest stores in the country at 40,000 square
feet, said the Beat poets rank high in the stolen category, along
with textbooks and art and photography books.
</P>
<P>
   Kerouac is also a favorite at both Shakespeare and Co.'s stores
on the Upper East Side and in lower Broadway in Manhattan. Linda
Marotta, senior buyer at the downtown store, says that Burroughs
and Bukowski are also popular steals. Nick Marino, general manager
of the uptown store, said that Dover Classics books, which sell for
$1 or $2, are also popular. He says he believes that art and travel
books that can be sold on the street are stolen by professionals.
</P>
<P>
   At Powell's Book Store, in Portland, Ore., one of the largest
chain stores, the general manager, Miriam Sontz, said people who
take books fall into two categories: those who steal on impulse and
those who take books to sell for money. She said that people take
books they would be ashamed to buy: books on cocaine cultivation,
sex dysfunction or ``racy'' books for teen-agers. Bibles are also a
favorite, she added, saying she does not know why.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Watkins, vice president and general manager of Vroman's
Bookstore, which has been in Pasadena, Calif., for 105 years, said
that drug dealers and the homeless steal salable books. She said
she believed that these thieves were given lists by used-book
stores specifying which titles were in demand. Art books, first
editions and hard-cover mysteries are hard to keep on the shelves,
she added.
</P>
<P>
   The Strand Book Store in Manhattan seems to attract a more
intellectual crowd. Although electronic detectors installed five
years ago significantly cut down on theft, the owner, Fred Bass,
said that before the heightened security, Greek and Latin classics,
books on higher mathemathics, philosophy, Judaica as well as other
scholarly and religious books were targets. These days, he said,
art books are taken by professional thieves.
</P>
<P>
   At Green Apple Books and Music in San Francisco, the general
manager, Pete Mulvihill, reports that current favorites for
shoplifters include Bibles and books on philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Across the bay, in Berkeley, Patrick Marks, buyer for Cody's
Books, said that before the security system was updated, works by
Toni Morrison and Bukowski would be stolen. Now the more persistent
thieves are more interested in monster books, language audio tapes,
Tarot cards and coins that come in game books.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuscaloosa, Ala., the Book Cellar's manager, Edna Thomas,
said that stealing was not a major problem, although occasionally
rock-and-roll and computer-game magazines were taken.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, theft does not seem to be much of a problem in
Martha's Vineyard, the small affluent resort. Dana Anderson, an
owner of Bickerton &AMP; Ripley in Edgartown, Mass., said that books on
summer reading lists were stolen occasionally as were small gift
books but that nothing major had been shoplifted. Alex Comfort's
``Joy of Sex'' used to be a favorite of thieves, she said, so the
store stopped stocking it.
</P>
<P>
   In Wareham, Mass., on the road to Cape Cod, Steve Bunshaft,
owner of Ken-Mark Books, said there was no problem with stealing.
His real worry? Competition from large chain bookstores in four
nearby malls.

   PEC, Kosovo _ Standing looted and lonely on the edge of this
eerily empty city is the Hotel Karagac, which may contain evidence
of one of the most horrid chapters of Serb atrocities during the
ethnic cleansing campaign in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel, a villa-type structure around a large courtyard, was
named by the U.S. State Department in May in its report, ``Erasing
History,'' as one of two sites where Serbs were taking ethnic
Albanian women for repeated rapes. But, inspections of the hotel
have not occurred and reporters there Friday were warned it could
be rigged with booby-traps.
</P>
<P>
   Rapes were part of the terror campaign intensified by the Serb
rulers of Kosovo during the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia. The Serbs
have been trying to kill or expel the majority ethnic Albanians
from the southern province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's dominant
republic.
</P>
<P>
   But, while dozens of massacre sites have been found since
Yugoslav forces began withdrawing from the province and NATO troops
entered, evidence of mass rapes has been harder to come by.
</P>
<P>
   British troops found evidence that rapes were committed in the
basement of a Serb police station Thursday, with boxes of condoms,
hard-core pornography and beds with restraints were among the items
in an apparent torture and interrogation center.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army, which has
helped uncover mass graves, said that the evidence of rapes has
come slower because victims fear coming forward and because the KLA
is still securing the region from Serb troops. Also, while bodies
are hard evidence of murder, evidence of rape can be less
definitive.
</P>
<P>
   But, while NATO forces and the KLA have gone to the effort to
close off mass graves, they have not taken action at sites rumored
to have been used for rapes.
</P>
<P>
   Shkendije(CQ) Hoda, deputy KLA commander of information for
Kosovo's Djakovica region, south of Pec, said the KLA have not been
able to track down any direct evidence of a rape center in that
city, though one was reported to be there by the U.S. State
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the women have come forward to report it,'' Hoda said.
Among the ethnic Albanians, a largely Muslim group, an extreme
stigma is placed on rape victims.
</P>
<P>
   She said she hoped international aid agencies would help counsel
women who were raped and that the crimes would only be revealed if
``the women of the world will help to convince them that their
stresses will be relieved.''
</P>
<P>
   A superficial review of the Hotel Karagac showed crude graffiti
of women and writing in Serbo-Croatian proclaiming, ``We are the
power forever.'' A woman's skirt was found in the ransacked bar
area.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel is on the edge of Pec in a wooded neighborhood with
few neighbors. The town is still believed to be inhabited by Serb
paramilitary forces and ethnic Albanians have been slow to return
from their refugee hideouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't been there because we are doing other jobs that we
think are more important,'' said Pec KLA commander Etem Ceku.
``Yesterday we had more fighting. . . that is more important.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Friday morning, record chill affected portions of the Great
Lakes and Ohio Valley as a large high pressure system from eastern
Canada settled over the region. Similarly, Saturday will dawn quite
cool and clear in the interior Northeast. Abundant sunshine will
propel temperatures rapidly upward, however, with afternoon
readings reaching the middle 70s from Ohio to Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Humid air will fuel numerous thundershowers in Florida on
Saturday. The showers will produce locally heavy rain, especially
in southern sections where a slow-moving front augments the ascent
of the sultry air. Intervals of clouds and sunshine will cover the
remainder of the Southeast. Isolated afternoon thunderstorms will
erupt, though it will remain dry in most areas.
</P>
<P>
   Breezes from the south will direct moist air into the eastern
Plains and Mississippi Valley, setting the stage for showers and
thunderstorms. The steadiest precipitation will fall from eastern
Oklahoma to Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Farther west, the showers and storms will be less numerous but
more potent. Winds changing direction with increasing altitude will
cause a few of the storms to rotate. These rotating thunderstorms,
called supercells, are capable of spawning tornadoes. Eastern
Montana and the western Dakotas are at especially high risk for
severe weather. Clouds and onshore breezes will bring cool air to
the Northwest coast. Interior California and southwest Arizona will
stay torrid while residual moisture in the lower portions of the
atmosphere fuels isolated thunderstorms in southeast Arizona and
southern New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Modern Chill
</P>
<P>
   Record low temperatures for June 18 were set at many locations
across the Middle West early Friday as expansive high pressure
crested over the region. In Chicago, the official thermometer
dropped to 46 degrees, eclipsing by one degree a record that had
stood since 1876. Careful records have been kept at most major
cities for about 100 years. But, Friday's chill is made more
impressive when it is considered that in order to set record
minimums, modern air masses must be colder than their 19th century
counterparts records because of the local heating effects caused by
urban growth.

WHEN AN INVESTIGATOR BECOMES A TARGET 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ If an employee believes he has been discriminated
against at work, he typically lodges a complaint with the human
resource department or affirmative action office.
</P>
<P>
   But what does the employee do when the top officer in charge of
investigating complaints is accused of the very same wrongdoing and
remains in office?
</P>
<P>
   Who does he turn to? More importantly, what can the institution
do to maintain its integrity in handling future discrimination
complaints?
</P>
<P>
   The issue popped up recently in a high-profile case involving
sex discrimination allegations at the University of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Equal Employment Opportunity Commission staff members recently
determined that Dennis Duffy, the general counsel of the University
of Houston, created a hostile and abusive working environment for
women and retaliated against an employee who complained.
</P>
<P>
   The case is pending, awaiting settlement discussions. The EEOC
will seek concessions, such as back wages, damages and
reinstatement, and will turn the case over to the Justice
Department if it can't reach a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   No lawsuit against the university or Duffy has been filed.
</P>
<P>
   Though the situation at the university is unusual, it's even
more unusual, say lawyers who specialize in job discrimination
cases, when the top officer continues handling his or her
anti-discrimination duties as Duffy has.
</P>
<P>
   Duffy didn't return telephone calls for comment. However,
Chancellor Arthur K. Smith said that Duffy is doing an outstanding
job and that he and the board of regents are fully behind Duffy.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SHIFT OF RESPONSIBILITIES ADVISED &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kerry Notestine, a lawyer who represents employers, said anytime
someone is investigated over allegations of serious wrongdoing,
it's a good idea to shift job responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   That way, employees can feel comfortable coming forward to
complain, Notestine said. Most employers would want to try to keep
a clear path open for making complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Reassigning the responsibilities shows the employees the system
works for them, and it also helps the company's legal position,
because it shows the regulators that the employer is doing
something about the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Bennett-Alexander, professor of employment law at the Terry
College of Business at the University of Georgia in Athens and an
expert on discrimination, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to give some integrity to the process,'' she says.
If a company doesn't, she added, ``People won't think it's on the
up and up.''
</P>
<P>
   An employee won't complain if he doesn't feel confident about
the process, she said. And if that happens, employees won't want to
stay and the problems fester.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
COMPANY RISKS LOSING A DEFENSE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also, by not farming out the duties of the person who handles
sex discrimination complaints, a company can risk losing an
important defense, Notestine said.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled companies can protect
themselves if they have a meaningful system to handle complaints.
But if an employee can prove he was too intimidated to come
forward, a company could lose and wind up liable.
</P>
<P>
   But is it fair to force someone to give up a duty temporarily if
he hasn't been found guilty by a court? Doesn't that affect the
person's reputation? And what recourse does the employee have if,
later, he or she is cleared?
</P>
<P>
   That a lawyer like Notestine who represents companies in
employment cases would urge a client under suspicion to step down
should not be surprising.
</P>
<P>
   The company lawyer is hired to look out for the company's best
interests, even if it means taking actions that might hurt a
potentially innocent employee's reputation.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers who represent individuals in such cases also suggest
company officers under suspicion should step aside or voluntarily
give up their sex discrimination investigatory work.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Rosenberg, an employment lawyer who represents
individuals, said he'd advise a client under suspicion to
relinquish his equal employment opportunity oversight while the
case is pending.
</P>
<P>
   It's bad to have a cloud hanging over you, he said.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid placing control in the hands of one person or office,
some companies provide many ways to file complaints.
</P>
<P>
   At Baker &AMP; Botts, 34 partners and administrators are designated
as people who can take complaints, said Richard Brann, an
employment lawyer and one of the designees.
</P>
<P>
   That way, people can probably find someone they're comfortable
talking to, said Brann. It takes courage to step forward, he said,
and you have to make it easy, not difficult.

THE CASH OF THE IRISH IS TALKING IN CASTLES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 20) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Fla.)   (af)  
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RECESS, Ireland _ For Sale: castles in Ireland and other grand
piles from Kildare to Kilkenny. Starting prices: $2.5 million to
$15 million-plus. Possible buyers: any of a number of Irish
millionaires who, in a scant few years of economic lift-off, have
suddenly displaced Americans and other foreigners as the prime
purchasers of high-ticket real estate hereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nouveau riche,'' said Jack Fagan, property editor of The
Irish Times, ``are really coming into their own.''
</P>
<P>
   True, many of Ireland's great houses, from Ashford Castle in
County Mayo near here to Adare Manor near Limerick, remain in the
hands of Americans and other outsiders who bought in the years
before the high-technology and financial services industries fired
up the Irish economy and persuaded many Irish emigrants to reverse
their tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Kane, the former Wall Street broker from Juno Beach,
Fla., has owned the luxurious Adare Manor since 1987. Kevin Crowe,
chairman of the Essex Corp., a New York investment firm, is
chairman of the board at the high-ticket Ashford Castle, west of
here on the shores of Lough Corrib. (Ashford is used as a hotel,
with rates of up to $660 a night, breakfast not included.)
</P>
<P>
   And Anthony F.J. O'Reilly, the American-based Irish newspaper
owner and the former chief executive of H.J. Heinz, has stakes in
Ashford Castle and another mansion used as a luxury hotel _
Dromoland Castle in County Clare _ plus his own private redoubt,
Castlemartin in County Kildare, 20 miles south of Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate agents say the market-movers these days are more
likely to be home-grown beneficiaries of this country's boom in
software and information technology. In Dublin, that surge has seen
prices for ordinary houses _ let alone castles, manors and country
estates _ triple in three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is doing well and there's a lot of disposable
income out there,'' said Edward Townsend, a Dublin agent with the
realtor Jackson-Stops McCabe. ``Before, you would have had 60
percent of country houses bought by overseas buyers and 40 percent
Irish. Now it's the other way round.''
</P>
<P>
   So what's up for grabs among the castle set? Two of Ireland's
most celebrated mansions are among the current offerings, with the
sellers apparently looking to take advantage of the hot market.
</P>
<P>
   Renata Coleman, a German businesswoman and polo player, is
selling Humewood Castle, below the Wicklow Hills south of Dublin;
the minimum asking price is $15 million. The castle _ a crenelated,
16-bedroom, 60,000-square-foot chunk of 19th-century gothic _ ranks
among the most expensive country houses on sale in recent years.
(Included in the 480-acre estate are a polo ground and four lakes,
two of them built in the last seven years, for duck-shooting.)
</P>
<P>
   The kind of buyers she has in mind seems apparent from a glossy
brochure laden with sumptuous photographs of four-poster beds and
ambassadorial tables. The castle, the brochure says, would make a
pretty good hotel, corporate entertainment center or private home.
</P>
<P>
   Farmleigh, the 78-acre Dublin home of the Guinness family, is
also on the market, and there is talk in real estate circles of a
big American hotel chain maneuvering to buy. The winner will get 10
bedroom suites, 10 more bedrooms and four more bathrooms, not to
mention sundry lodges, houses, courtyards, garages, coach houses
and stables. There is a pool, of course, and a snooker room, not to
mention a library stacked with leather-bound tomes.
</P>
<P>
   The minimum-bid target for Farmleigh is ``substantially in
excess'' of $15 million. Considering the huge maintenance and staff
bills that accrue to owners of castles pretty much anywhere _ along
with the price of horses to put in the stables, cars to put in the
garages and grand entertainment to match the palatial salons _ that
might seem a tidy sum, even for Ireland's newly rich.
</P>
<P>
   But, said Fagan at The Irish Times: ``We have probably thrown up
more millionaires than any other country. And they are buying up
the best houses.''
</P>
<P>
   Hugh Hamilton of the Dublin realtors Hamilton, Osborne King had
pretty much the same story. ``The majority of the properties are
bought by either Irish or people with Irish connections,'' he said.
But Americans, he said, ``are certainly part of the market,'' as
Christine and Walter Griffith of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., can attest.
</P>
<P>
   They are selling their Irish home _ the nine-bedroom Rossennara
House at Kilmoganny, County Kilkenny (asking price: around $2.25
million), which they bought in 1980 from Richard Condon, the
writer. For people looking for an American connection, this might
be it: Griffith, his wife said, is descended from two American
presidents _ the Adamses _ and Rossennara was designed by James
Hoban, whose other achievements include the White House. Frank
Sinatra is said to have stayed there.
</P>
<P>
   Staff quarters and an indoor swimming pool are included,
naturally. ``You do need staff,'' said Mrs. Griffith, who is Irish.
</P>
<P>
   But why buy in Ireland? ``There's a lot of peace and quiet and
security, and it's crime-free,'' she said by telephone from Fort
Lauderdale. ``It's where time stands still. Here, everything is
go-go-go.'' So far, she said, she is still looking for someone
willing to spend the money on those charms.
</P>
<P>
   The eventual buyers of the current crop of castles and country
homes, however, are certain to discover that running a mansion is
not for the faint-hearted _ as some Americans found after an
earlier wave of purchases.
</P>
<P>
   As head of a largely American syndicate, Minerva Mason, an
American from Jacksonville, Fla., has been closely involved for the
last 20 years in the running of Ballynahinch Castle near this town
in Connemara, County Galway.
</P>
<P>
   Ballynahinch, renowned for its fishing, its 350-acre landscaped
estate and 13,000 acres of woodcock shooting, has been run as a
hotel since the 1940s. It came into American hands in 1957 for a
fraction of its present value, which Mrs. Mason put at around $15
million.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Mason, who spends three months a year in a separate house
on the castle grounds, reckons she has sunk ``millions'' into the
castle's 28 guest rooms, and is still investing by adding an annex
of 12 rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their cost, mansions mean different things to different
people. For some, like the Griffiths at Rossennara, a castle, or at
least a manor house, can actually be a home. For others, like the
owners of Ashford Castle, they are commercial properties run as
luxury resorts. For yet others, they are symbols of having arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons for ownership, it's easy to imagine the
cachet that comes with it. ``It's a good conversation starter,''
said Mrs. Mason at Ballynahinch, ``to say `I'm going to my castle
in Ireland.'''

SOUTHERN DEMOCRATS WALK FINE LINE ON CULTURAL AND GUN VOTES 
</HEADLINE>

Washington Bureau of the New York Times Regional Newspapers)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was not an easy week to be a Southern Democrat
in the House.
</P>
<P>
   With a high-profile debate on a juvenile crime bill that touched
on gun control, prayer in school, violence in the media and
societal values, Southern Democrats were torn between the desires
of party leaders in Washington and the more conservative leanings
of many voters back home.
</P>
<P>
   The results were mixed.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a rash of school shootings, a handful of Southern
Democrats, including Rep. Mike McIntyre, D-N.C., supported new
government restrictions on the entertainment industry, backing a
Republican proposal that still failed because of concerns that such
curbs would violate the First Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   There were exceptions. For example, Rep. Bud Cramer, D-Ala.,
rejected that GOP effort to make it illegal to sell books, movies,
video games or other materials that are explicitly sexual or
violent to minors. Reps. Mel Watt, D-N.C., Eva Clayton, D-N.C., and
Chris John, D-La., also opposed that measure.
</P>
<P>
   But then Cramer, John, and McIntyre joined 42 other Democrats in
backing the idea that states allow the posting of the Ten
Commandments in public buildings. The measure was passed by the
House on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   McIntyre, John, and Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., also supported an
amendment by Rep. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., that makes it harder for
plaintiffs to challenge any religious practices in schools.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Southern Democrats kept a low profile
throughout the debate, declining to take the lead in the fight to
enact stricter gun controls.
</P>
<P>
   Although they voted for some of the measures, they left the
heavy lifting to Democrats from large cities where gun control is
more popular.
</P>
<P>
   Southern Republicans displayed more uniformity and enthusiasm.
They embraced the so-called values amendments and rejected the
stronger gun-control initiatives that had been opposed by the
National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   THE (UN)LOCKED BOX
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are having a mighty hard time displaying consistency
when it comes to protecting Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   They keep pushing legislation that would set up a so-called
lockbox, keeping the Social Security Trust Fund off limits from
lawmakers who want to spend the money elsewhere. But at the same
time, they've voting for bills that violate their own spending
caps.
</P>
<P>
   Case in point. Just hours after Republicans in the Senate tried
for a third time to break a Democratic filibuster against the
Social Security lockbox, many of the same Republicans supported a
separate spending bill that would kick open the lock box to pay for
``emergency'' needs.
</P>
<P>
   On a procedural vote, they supported a bill that would set up a
loan program for the steel industry. Estimated cost: $270 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't have it both ways,'' complained Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas. ``You either want to spend money or you don't want to
spend money.''
</P>
<P>
   STRANGE BEDFELLOWS
</P>
<P>
   As a lifelong Democrat, Sen. Bob Graham of Florida might not be
the first choice to headline a policy seminar at a conservative
think tank.
</P>
<P>
   But there he was, center stage at the Heritage Foundation in
Washington, to talk about his proposal to allow private investors
and developers to use tax-exempt private activity bonds to build
schools. Those schools would then be leased to the public school
system.
</P>
<P>
   The Heritage Foundation, a champion of public-private
partnerships and good, old capitalism, sponsored the seminar to
build momentum for the bill, which has already passed the Senate
Finance Committee. Graham supports the measure as a way of
jump-starting school construction, which is lagging behind soaring
student enrollment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education is rightfully a state and local matter,'' Graham
said, defending his bill as ``part of what should be a smorgasbord
of innovative school construction incentives.''
</P>
<P>
   GONE FISHIN'
</P>
<P>
   Federal fisheries managers continue to struggle for an
acceptable balance between replenishing the stocks of red snapper
in the Gulf of Mexico and limiting the economic damage to the
thriving recreational fishing industry that depends on the gulf's
signature fish.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest move, the National Marine Fisheries Service upped
the size limit of the allowable catch from 15 to 18 inches per fish
while retaining the bag limit at four per day. The agency estimates
the move will reduce snapper catch and allow the fishing season to
remain open until the end of August rather than closing at the
start of the month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our analyses suggests the increased size limit will provide
benefits to recreational fisherman and the for-hire fishing
business in the region without affecting the rebuilding schedule
for this overfished stock,'' said William Hogarth, head of the
agency's Southeast region.

FROM THE PRITZKER TO THE BLITZKER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany, Britain, Washington, D.C., Minn.)   By HERBERT MUSCHAMP    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On June 7 Sir Norman Foster received the Pritzker Architecture
Prize. The presentation ceremony was held in Berlin, where, by
chance, Sir Norman's inspired remodeling of the Reichstag was
completed in April. The Reichstag was topped off just in time to
welcome the federal government of a reunited Germany back to its
prewar capital, and to welcome the Pritzker's guests to
architecture's toniest annual bash.
</P>
<P>
   I like the idea of the Pritzker Prize, which had its 20th
anniversary this year. The prize is often described as
architecture's Nobel. If Alfred Nobel, who made his fortune selling
gunpowder, could establish a highly esteemed peace prize, then why
shouldn't we applaud the late Jay Pritzker, who made his fortune
littering the world with Hyatt Hotels, for creating an architecture
prize? At a time of esthetic relativism, the Pritzker is one of the
best instruments we have for distinguishing architecture from
commercial simulations of it.
</P>
<P>
   But the triumphalist aura surrounding the Pritzker Prize is
unsettling in a way that the Swedish Academy's pomp is not. The
designation of the winners as laureates. The spectacular locations
_ Versailles, Prague Castle, the White House _ where the
presentation ceremonies have been held. The celebrity culture,
which the award contributes to, and which degrades architecture.
All this can leave an architecture critic with a feeling of
distaste. But it also leaves me with an uneasy sense of
identification. For, like the Pritzker program, architectural
criticism tends to overlook one simple fact about architecture:
Buildings occupy land. Land is not just so many square feet of
public or private property. As often as not, and regardless of
ownership, land is contested space.
</P>
<P>
   We see this demonstrated graphically when buildings are blown up
or torn down. But even under less dramatic circumstances, property
is a combat zone for opposed interests. What will it be used for?
By whom? Will these community gardens give way to housing? Is the
owner next door allowed to cast shadows on my lawn? And views! Who
gets to control the views?
</P>
<P>
   The smooth skin of architecture glosses over such conflicts. (In
Berlin it's difficult to find where the wall stood just 10 years
ago.) If I think a design is outstanding, the odds are that I'll
gloss over those tensions too. Architecture is a history of style
written by the victors.
</P>
<P>
   Saskia Sassen, a sociologist and urban planning professor at
Columbia University's School of Architecture, argues that such
local disputes are part of a global phenomenon. She has described
ours as a culture of eviction. Land values, free enterprise, the
reliance on housing starts as a leading economic indicator; these
market forces exert a constant pressure to move on. Ms. Sassen
points out that globalization means much more than the
transnational integration of corporate wealth. It also describes
the illegal immigration of the displaced into ``first world''
cities.
</P>
<P>
   If this seems dismayingly Marxist or just plain paranoid, then I
urge you to read ``The Long-Winded Lady,'' a collection of Maeve
Brennan's ``Talk of the Town'' pieces for The New Yorker (reprinted
last year in paperback by Mariner Books). Brennan spent most of her
adult life in small Manhattan hotels. She rented rooms in midtown
in the 1950s and '60s when Rockefeller Center was being extended
westward in the style of the steel-and-glass colossuses that now
line the Avenue of the Americas in the 50s blocks.
</P>
<P>
   The architects who designed the Rockefeller buildings, like
Wallace K. Harrison, were not only responding to economic changes
but were also being idealistic. They believed they were upholding
the principles of good design as taught by the Museum of Modern
Art. Their buildings allowed more natural light into offices and
opened up new spaces to sit or stroll in the congested city. These
were supposed to be good things.
</P>
<P>
   But to Brennan, the long-winded lady, the new buildings were
just office space. ``The new Office Space giants have nothing to do
with our daily lives, or with ordinary things, and they are taking
away our streets,'' she wrote. Yet Brennan seemed conscious that
upheaval, what Henry James called New York's ``perpetual
repudiation of the past,'' was part of the city's excitement. At
least it inspired some of her greatest essays.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw the inside walls of the building that's coming down
below my office today,'' she wrote in another article. ``Yellow,
green, brown, ugly pale shades of those three colors, the walls
made a poor show. They looked sad, as though they had never
expected anything better than to be thrown away.''
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of her life Brennan legendarily took up residence
in the ladies' room at The New Yorker's offices. A heavy drinker,
she may well have been sociopathically peripatetic. But her prose
is lucid and sharp, and her stories read like the diary of an
evictee. Eccentric she may have been, but a reader today can easily
identify with her precariousness, her nomadism, her effort to make
a home in an exciting city where even then affordable housing was
hard to come by.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the housing situation has gotten worse. As an article
in this paper reported, while the building boom is creating new
housing, it is also increasing rents. We are nomads in our own
city. The struggle for space may not involve mass migrations across
national boundaries, but it induces a constant background of
anxiety over imminent displacement. Construction sites are preceded
by destruction sites. If we feel pride in the revival of the city's
economy, we may also legitimately fear that the next boom is going
to pitch us into the streets. Or, as Brennan observed, it might
take the streets themselves away.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is time to create a Blitzker Prize to honor the
world's most creative demolitions. The old Alexander's department
store in New York City. The farms of Lancaster County,
Pennsylvania? Downtown Baghdad?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Lebbeus Woods is one of a number of architects who were students
in the 1960s and sought to drop out of the eviction economy by
confining their work to unbuilt, paper projects. Their designs have
a science fiction look, but they respond to political fact. In the
last decade, many of Woods' projects have dealt with the
destructive rampages in the former Yugoslavia, where he has often
traveled. Metallic forms resembling gigantic shrapnel plunge into
the hearts of cities, their buildings, streets and public squares
</P>
<P>
   We could be looking at images of destruction, but we could also
see these designs as an effort to develop a constructive vocabulary
for building for the eviction society. They are protests against
the smooth facades with which our builders mask the violence, both
military and economic, that we inflict on cities.
</P>
<P>
   I go back and forth about this work. Why does Woods limit
himself to metaphor? One of architecture's glories is to extend
metaphor to material reality. Yet Woods has the right to be a voice
of conscience. Perhaps it's fair to regard him as contemporary
architecture's most salient political cartoonist.
</P>
<P>
   The first Pritzker Prize ceremony was held in 1979 at Dumbarton
Oaks in Washington, a small pavilion designed by Philip Johnson,
the Pritzker's first honoree. Two weeks ago a slide of the
pavilion's garden was projected at the presentation of the first
annual Catherine R. Brown Awards for Landscape Architecture in New
Urbanism. The awards are named for one of America's most gifted
urbanists, who died last year at 47. The garden was one of Brown's
favorite places.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was trained as a landscape architect and urban planner,
but no professional title adequately describes what she did. With
her husband, William R. Morrish, she directed the Design Center for
American Urban Landscape, a study and research group at the
University of Minnesota. The group's focus is the contemporary
American suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Brown understood that specialized disciplines and fields of
information have done as much to fragment the landscape as market
pressures or hostile neighbors. Architects, developers,
environmentalists, politicians, planners, highway engineers,
retailers _ all spin within separate spheres. Her specialty lay in
bringing them into coherent relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Though involved with the New Urbanism crowd, Brown understood
that the problems of suburban sprawl could not be solved simply by
persuading rich people to build big houses in period styles on
small parcels of land. Working mostly with small second- and
third-ring suburban communities in the Midwest, she practiced
planning as a form of adult education. If you build houses on this
slope or cut down those trees, how would that affect the ground
water? Could you set this superstore perpendicular to the highway
instead of parallel to it? Is there a need for public transit? What
kind?
</P>
<P>
   In the 1994 book ``Planning to Stay,'' which she wrote with
Morrish, Brown emphasized that planning is as much a matter of
seeing as of designing. What are the major features in a stable
neighborhood: streets, gardens, libraries, markets? How do they fit
together? She showed that creativity in architecture is not limited
to visual form. It also finds expression in public policy.
</P>
<P>
   She always came back to the land, but never in a naive or
sentimental way. A devotee of the landscape historian J.B. Jackson,
Brown embraced his conception of landscape as a concrete,
three-dimensional shared reality. But shared reality can be
explosive. Brown would never have won a Blitzker. She was a poet in
the sense understood by the Greeks: a maker of the tissue that
holds a society together.

<P>
   Is the worst over?
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to think so after a week in which the Consumer Price
Index for May came in unchanged from April and Alan Greenspan, the
chairman of the Federal Reserve, seemed to signal that the central
bank may need only a modest increase in its short-term interest
rate target to slow growth, deflate this year's inflation boomlet
and keep the economy on track.
</P>
<P>
   The shift in sentiment was big. A week ago, the yield on the
30-year bond jumped to an 18-month high of 6.16 percent as
investors thought that two _ or even three _ rate increases were
possible. By Friday, the yield had tumbled back below 6 percent, to
5.97 percent. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index finished the
week up 3.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   While investors may be relieved, what the Fed will do after
policy makers meet on June 30 _ when they are almost certain to
raise their short-term interest rate target a quarter of a
percentage point _ is still up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   The spreads between yields on Treasury securities and corporate
bonds, junk bonds and emerging-markets debt are wide enough to
indicate that some investors see the risk of near-term turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan signaled a rate increase when he told the Joint
Economic Committee of Congress that ``when we can be pre-emptive we
should be, because modest pre-emptive actions can obviate the need
of more drastic actions at a later date that could destabilize the
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors took their cues from ``modest'' and ``more drastic
action'' and concluded that one rate increase might be enough.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenspan sent other signals that can be interpreted to mean
rate increases will go as far as needed to assure that economic
growth slows to around a 3 percent rate.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, he said the 4 percent average annual growth of the
last four years was based on a two percentage-point increase in
worker productivity and a one percentage-point increase in the
working-age population. The remaining point, he said, came from the
shrinking of the pool of job seekers without work.
</P>
<P>
   That last development ``represents an unsustainable trend,''
Greenspan said. Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at Hoenig &AMP; Co.,
said Greenspan has set a speed limit because he does not want a
further decline in the unemployment rate. If that happens,
Greenspan faces the inflationary wage increases that the Fed is
determined to avoid.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bull would say, `I think the economy will slow down pretty
much on its own, so we are fine,''' Barbera said. ``A bear would
say, `Greenspan told us rates are going up until the economy slows
down.'''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the worst may be over for the average investor, who
should look beyond that uncertainty. If the Fed does what is
expected _ and there is no good reason to think that it won't _
then the outlook for both bonds and stocks is positive over the
longer term. Market timing is not a game that smaller investors _
with long-term goals _ should play in any case.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate market reaction to rate increases often ignores
the long-term perspective. ``The knee-jerk reaction _ one never
knows. It can be bad,'' said Abby Joseph Cohen, the market
strategist at Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co.. ``What matters is what happens
after that.'' After the necessary rate increase _ she is not
predicting how many will be needed to slow growth _ she expects the
market outlook to improve, helped by what she believes will be good
second-quarter earnings reports. The second quarter, Ms. Cohen
added, might even be strong enough to make her increase her
corporate earnings forecast, which is now 7 to 8 percent growth
this year and next.
</P>
<P>
   That means investors can consider picking up some bonds on the
assumption that they will rally as rates fall _ in the second half
of the year __ in the wake of a Fed success. Sticking with stocks
looks OK, too, as good earnings reports should be even a better bet
in the third and fourth quarters as the comparisons to 1998 get
easier.
</P>
<P>
   The Fed, Ms. Cohen said, ``can do this in a way that does not
harm the economy.'' As she did with the one-quarter-point rate
increase in March 1997, Ms. Cohen is calling this a ``flu shot.''
Yes, it hurts. But it staves off something worse.

WHERE CAN WE PUT THE GARBAGE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CECIL JOHNSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   To paraphrase the performer who once called himself Prince, I
was dozing when I started writing this, so please forgive me if it
turns surreal.
</P>
<P>
   More precisely, I had a nightmare, and at the point where the
foul fiends from the black landfill closed in on me, I awakened and
had a vision.
</P>
<P>
   There I was, trapped in Lady Liberty's torch, gazing down at the
horrid spectacle of a New York harbor turned rusty red, and
smelling _ even at that height _ the stench of mountains of rotting
garbage along the shore and piled in the streets as far inland as I
could see.
</P>
<P>
   I had fled there in desperation, trying to escape from dozens of
hideous monsters who looked for all the world like the thing from
the junk movie ``The Toxic Avenger.'' But there was no escape. They
were closing in on me there in the Statue of Liberty when I bolted
awake, yelling, ``Chad!''
</P>
<P>
   It was the name of the country, not that of a person, that I
called out. I said it the way someone says, ``Eureka! I've found
it!'' Chad and some other places like that, I had concluded, might
be this country's escape from the waste disposal nightmare that
threatens to engulf us.
</P>
<P>
   I had fallen asleep after reading the recent article in Parade
magazine that poses the alarming question, ``What Will We Do With
All Our Garbage?''
</P>
<P>
   That story asserts that:
</P>
<P>
   _The amount of solid waste generated by America annually has
doubled and then some since 1960.
</P>
<P>
   _California, Texas, New York and Florida (in that order) produce
the most garbage.
</P>
<P>
   _Total production of garbage in this country divides out to
about 4.4 pounds per person per day.
</P>
<P>
   _Cities are running out of landfill space. And the landfills may
pose problems for public health.
</P>
<P>
   The story points out that the conventional wisdom that materials
deposited in landfills rot away over time and become harmless isn't
necessarily so. Some things remain just as they were when buried,
and others are mummified and preserved permanently, the article
asserts.
</P>
<P>
   That is believed to happen because of the Tupperware effect
created by the plastic lining of modern landfills. And even with
the liners, landfills are prone to leak hazardous liquids that can
pollute ground water.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the problems with landfills, the greater problem is
that there are not going to be enough of them to meet the nation's
garbage disposal needs if Americans keep generating as much of the
stuff as they now are and the population keeps growing.
</P>
<P>
   So what's the answer? Parade speaks of recycling, avoiding
excess packaging, reusing more things and throwing away less. Those
things will help. But I think the answer is Chad.
</P>
<P>
   I hope no citizens of that country are offended by this, but I
think there is a financial bonanza to be reaped by countries like
Chad through leasing solid-waste burial rights in their desert
regions to giant waste disposal companies like Waste Management
Inc.
</P>
<P>
   I focus upon Houston-based Waste Management because it is the
biggest such company, with about 22 percent of the nation's garbage
disposal business, and because it already is an international firm.
Moreover, I know something about the company _ most of it positive
_ because it collects and disposes of solid refuse in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Waste Management definitely will need more landfill capacity
somewhere, if it overcomes the legal obstacles to its getting the
contract to dispose of New York's garbage after that city closes
its mammoth Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   If I were in charge at Waste Management, I would have
international lobbyists cultivating relationships with countries
like Chad, Sudan and Morocco that have large expanses of arid,
unproductive, uninhabitable desert.
</P>
<P>
   I'd have them make the case that sand with no oil under it is a
liability that could be turned into a huge asset _ a source of
revenue for the government and employment for hundreds of its
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   I'd have those lobbyists emphasize that the refuse would pose no
health risks because it would buried far away from urban centers,
that the intense desert heat would cause it to degrade, and there
would be no leaching because of the sparse rainfall.
</P>
<P>
   Then they could throw out the possibility that the rotting
garbage might make some portions of the desert bloom again
eventually.
</P>
<P>
   Far-fetched, you say? Hardly. I doubt that this vision is in any
way original. Planners at Waste Management and its competitors
probably already are working on it, or something like it.
</P>
<P>
   No, the desertification of garbage is not a pipe dream. The
notion is far more realistic than the belief that America can ever
recapture enough landfill capacity for its future needs just
through conserving, recycling and reusing.
</P>

TRANSSEXUAL ECONOMIST SAYS GENDER GUIDES INTELLECT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Iowa, Ill.)  (mk) 
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Michael Foley, third-generation owner of
Foley Fish Co., as Boston Irish as the Kennedys and as charming,
greeted Deirdre McCloskey with a kiss on the cheek and a gallantry.
``You look better than the last time I saw you,'' he said. And
Deirdre melted, hugging him in gratitude and relief.
</P>
<P>
   They had played high school football together, these two
6-footers, and had gone on to Harvard, class of '64. They had seen
each other at the 25th reunion in 1989. Deirdre _ then Donald,
still a man _ took his wife and two children to those festivities.
Now, at the 35th reunion, she arrived at the opening reception
alone, her blond hair pinned up with a silver clasp, her outfit a
black dress, black shawl, silver bracelets and pumps _ and she ran
almost immediately into her old pal Mike Foley, who put her at
ease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would prefer that there was a pill I could give to the
world, and they would forget I had ever been a man,'' Ms. McCloskey
said later. ``But there isn't a pill, and since I want to continue
in my profession, I must change people's minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McCloskey, who teaches at the University of Iowa and at
Erasmus University in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, is gradually
becoming one of the most famous American transsexuals. That is
partly because of her prominence as an economist and historian, but
also because of her transition strategy. She has described her
experience in many articles and talks, and in September the
University of Chicago Press will publish ``Crossing: A Memoir,'' a
detailed account of her journey. Her hope is that through openness,
frankness and constant repetition of her story, her reincarnation
as a woman will be accepted as natural and healthy.
</P>
<P>
   But if Ms. McCloskey has switched sexes successfully, she is
still in the early stages of a second significant transition. After
years of surgery, self-discipline, a face-lift and hormones to
alter her appearance, her voice, her mannerisms, her emotions and
her sex organs, she is trying, at age 56, to make economists aware
of just how much gender affects their thinking. Men dominate the
profession, occupying most of the tenured professorships, but Ms.
McCloskey argues that women by temperament and cultural
conditioning make better economists. They tend to perceive the
economy differently from men, she says, and more realistically.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is this romantic idea among men that they are free
agents in the marketplace, without any ties except to their
individual selves,'' Ms. McCloskey said. ``While men think of
themselves in metaphors of competition, there is an assumption
among women that we are together, helping each other survive.'' She
added: ``I was an aggressive, assertive male, and I felt
comfortable. Now I am ashamed because that was so very macho.''
</P>
<P>
   Men, in this scheme, see an autonomous individual as the chief
economic actor, each individual enhancing the marketplace by
seeking his own pleasure or profit. Women, in contrast, are loving,
flexible, graceful and caring, particularly for their children and
for others within their families and social circles. They are more
willing to act as a family unit or social group, subordinating
their personal desires to the needs of the group.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. McCloskey's unusual switch might make her seem the
perfect case study to test whether gender affects thinking, her
views raise eyebrows among some sister economists who resist any
attempt to make their discipline a matter of gender. Indeed, the
notion that men and women economists _ or men and women scientists,
historians or architects, for that matter _ think differently has
provoked heated debate.
</P>
<P>
   Many female economists agree that differences exist but insist
they are learned differences, imposed by a culture and a market
economy that functions mostly in the male image, assigning
different roles to the sexes and treating women less well than men.
Given the opportunity, ``men can do anything that women can do
intellectually and emotionally, and vice versa,'' said Barbara
Bergman, an economist at American University.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bergman is a leader of a small group of feminist economists
(including men as well as women) who concern themselves with the
issues that put women at a disadvantage in the marketplace. Child
care is one. So are unequal pay, breast-feeding while holding a
job, caring for old parents and doing most of the housework.
Deirdre McCloskey is trying to join herself to this group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Feminine gestures are not God's own creation,'' Ms. McCloskey
acknowledges in her book. ``This of course I know. The social
construction of gender is, after all, something a gender-crosser
comes to know with unusual vividness. She does it for a living.''
</P>
<P>
   But having gone through the very difficult process of switching
sexes, Ms. McCloskey, who cross-dressed for decades before she
finally declared herself a woman, has a lot invested in the joys of
her new womanhood. Whatever their origin, she says, feminine
feelings and behavior rarely show up in men and certainly not in
male-dominated mainstream economics, which she likens to ``boys
playing games in a sandbox.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, she enjoyed her new womanhood at the reunion. Harvard
in 1964 was all male, but Radcliffe women from that year also
participated, and at many events Ms. McCloskey seemed to be just
another aging, successful ``Cliffie,'' in her case a good natured
one, patient and sympathetic as a listener and quick to tell her
story to puzzled classmates who, upon meeting her, vaguely
remembered a male McCloskey in Adams House.
</P>
<P>
   She had given some advance notice. ``Are you sitting down?'' she
wrote in the reunion book, a collection of thumbnail updates,
mailed to the alumni before their gathering. ``I've become a woman.
No joke. I've always wanted to, and finally in 1995 did it. Now
`becoming a woman' is in some senses impossible. I still have XY
genes and, what is more important, a man's life up to age 53. But
some things can be done, with the result a very happy and very tall
woman.''

   By the night of the square dance, under a huge tent in Radcliffe
Yard, she felt quite at home as a woman, even having a tete-a-tete
with a Radcliffe alumna whom Donald McCloskey had dated when they
were college freshmen. And after the paper-plate dinner, Deirdre
danced for two hours. She coaxed a shy man onto the floor as her
partner, a librarian, who had not, as a Harvard student, known
Donald McCloskey, or any Radcliffe girls for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt, as I was being swung, like I was very much in the
women's role,'' she said. ``I felt pretty and feminine. That is a
wonderful feeling, a tremendous feeling. Even saying to the men,
`Come on now, dance,' that sort of talk, that is a woman's
activity, a mother's and a grandmother's. Women feel a
responsibility for making social arrangements and men take them for
granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Her memoir is laced with passages that view men and women as
being locked into gender roles, the women's role being by far the
more satisfying and desirable.
</P>
<P>
   From women on Iowa's faculty, for example, she learned this
rule: ``When you run into somebody, never rush by self-absorbed, as
Donald did; always stop and chat.'' Or take this passage: ``When
the average grown-up woman leaves the table, she looks for stray
cups to be washed, part of the cleaning, loving, caring that women
are always doing half unconsciously.''
</P>
<P>
   Or this observation about herself: ``Along with millions of
other women in the world, she was sad watching the funeral of
Princess Diana, in the coffee room of a motel in Dallas before
electrolysis.''
</P>
<P>
   Or these nuances: ``Women put their hands to their chests when
speaking of themselves. Men barge through. Women look frequently at
nonspeaking participants in a conversation. Men don't look at each
other when talking.''
</P>
<P>
   Some female economists, citing such comments, call her a former
man trying to teach women how to be women. ``Deirdre is
reprogramming herself as a woman, and that inevitably leads to a
search for stereotypes,'' said Claudia Goldin, a Harvard economist
and friend, acknowledging the criticism. Nancy Folbre, an economist
at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, offers a different
slant. If Ms. McCloskey's gender assignments seem exaggerated, Ms.
Folbre said, they reflect her struggle to be ``read'' as a woman
just when gender roles are becoming more androgynous.
</P>
<P>
   No one has given Deirdre McCloskey more support through her
gender-crossing than her 75-year-old mother, Helen McCloskey. She
is the widow of a prominent Harvard professor, an expert on
constitutional law who died of a heart attack in 1969, just as
their eldest son, Donald, completed his Ph.D in economics at
Harvard and joined the University of Chicago faculty.
</P>
<P>
   Helen McCloskey admired her husband's achievements, which she
associated with maleness, and she sees in Deirdre the same ``steely
male intellectual quality'' that her husband had, and Donald, too.
Men, she argues, are the builders, the creators. She may be one
herself. Left with an inadequate inheritance, Mrs. McCloskey, a
housewife in marriage, has supported herself in widowhood by
buying, fixing up and reselling 15 homes, living in them during the
remodeling. Her latest acquisition, a two-bedroom house, is in
Centreville on Cape Cod, and Deirdre visited on her way to the
Harvard reunion. The subject of the steely male mind came up at
breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my first born, my wonderful, wonderful child who is so
bright,'' she said. ``One reason I can accept what she has done is
that I do not see dramatic changes in her intellectual qualities
acquired over a lifetime.''
</P>
<P>
   The daughter is uncomfortable. ``Having done the steely bit,''
Deirdre McCloskey said, ``I know where its cracks are, where its
foolishnesses lie.'' And the mother replied: ``Those are
conclusions you could have come to as a man. It is a maturing
process. I think that had you remained a man, you would have
matured. You would have softened.''
</P>
<P>
   Deirdre McCloskey's thinking has indeed evolved. But it started
long before she went full time as Deirdre in November 1995. Donald
gave up tenure at Chicago and moved to Iowa in 1980 out of
frustration that economic research at Chicago had become too
focused on applied math and economic models that could prove any
thesis, depending on the assumptions fed into the formulaic models.
</P>
<P>
   Fame came to Donald McCloskey for ``The Rhetoric of Economics,''
published in 1986, in which he argued that economics, for all its
pretensions as a scientific discipline, is ultimately a
conversation in which rhetoric _ language _ carries the argument.
He also made a name for himself as a historian of the British
economy by describing the measurable, ``quantitative impact'' of
various forces and developments _ a far cry from the abstract,
mathematical modeling prevalent today. Women are better at
quantitative research than men, Ms. McCloskey says.
</P>
<P>
   But few if any female economists share the policy solution that
Ms. McCloskey is now trying to give to feminist economics. While
the women favor a government role to help make women more equal to
men in the job market _ child care subsidies, for example _ Deirdre
advocates a libertarian approach, drawing on beliefs that Donald
first embraced as a young economist. Government is likely to make
matters worse, Ms. McCloskey says. Better to rely on the virtues
that shaped economic behavior in Adam Smith's day. Instead of just
``prudence,'' which is another way of saying self-interest or
profit _ the virtue she says men like so much _ bring back four
other woman-friendly virtues as motivating forces: love, courage,
temperance, justice. She is writing a book on the subject.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Goldin, the Harvard economist and friend, is skeptical.
Feminist economics has not produced concrete proposals, she says,
and re-emphasizing the virtues is no exception. But Deirdre
McCloskey persists. ``You discover that no matter how you come at
it mathematically, an economy takes place in a moral universe,''
she said. ``That has been a big problem for economists to
understand; they are so tied to prudence they don't regard other
virtues as having anything to do with economics.''

SURVEYING THE SHIFTING PHONE-DEAL LANDSCAPE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 20) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Colo.)   (af)  
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors are excused if their wires are crossed by developments
in the $1 trillion telecommunications business.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, even the professionals are a bit bewildered by the
battle two fast-growing upstarts _ Global Crossing and Qwest
Communications International _ are waging for US West, a stodgy
Baby Bell, and the Frontier Corp., a long-distance company that in
1996 bought part of Qwest's network.
</P>
<P>
   The market has already rendered verdicts of sorts. Global
Crossing's stock has fallen more than 20 percent since it struck an
agreement with US West. And Qwest's shares have retreated about 25
percent since last Sunday, when it began a hostile bid. The decline
probably isn't sitting well with Qwest shareholders, a group that
includes BellSouth, which in April paid $3.5 billion for a 10
percent slice of the company.
</P>
<P>
   Brian B. Hayward, manager of the Invesco Worldwide
Communications fund, owns shares of both Qwest and Global Crossing.
From his office in Denver, he took some time last week to sort
through the events. Here are some excerpts. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)There have been a lot of combinations in this
industry the last few years. Is the struggle for US West comparable
with any telecommunications deal that preceded it?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Worldcom going after MCI is somewhat comparable, but MCI was
not a regional Bell company. But there really hasn't been a
situation before this where a new upstart carrier went after a
local carrier. It's going to be interesting. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Which company would benefit most from owning US West
and Frontier?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Of the two, it makes more sense for Qwest. But I have a lot
of questions.
</P>
<P>
   Why, for starters, go after US West, the slowest-growing
regional Bell in the country? Around here, it is called US Worst.
If you had told me three months ago there would be a bidding war
for US West, I would not have believed it.
</P>
<P>
   I think both companies are going after it because they feel they
need these local assets, and that US West is about the only
regional Bell left that either can afford to go after, with the
exception of BellSouth, which has a stake in Qwest.
</P>
<P>
   And I am not clear why Qwest feels the need to get Frontier's
assets back. If they do, they will be paying billions for assets
they sold for about $400 million. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)But US West does offer access to the so-called last
mile into homes, doesn't it?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. At base, that is what they are after. It is the most complex
and difficult part of the network to complete. It is also
effectively impossible to duplicate because it is prohibitively
expensive. But that is where the holy grail is: serving customers.
The more you can offer the consumer _ local and long distance,
Internet access, data transmission, you name it _ the better. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)So how do you think this will play out?(end
italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. In the conference call after it announced its hostile offer,
Qwest made it plain it was making two stand-alone offers, one for
US West, the other for Frontier.
</P>
<P>
   If I were guessing, I could see Global Crossing getting Frontier
and US West going with Qwest. And remember, we don't know where
BellSouth is in all of this. I would have to think that at the
least Qwest put in a phone call to them before they launched their
bid.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, BellSouth and US West together with Qwest would make a
much more formidable combination.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the premium Qwest offered over Global Crossing was taken
out last Monday, the day after the deal was announced. I am sure
Qwest management expected some decline in the stock price when they
announced it, but I doubt they thought the stock would fall as much
as it has. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)How does this fight fit into the evolution of the
telecommunications business?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't know how many major worldwide telecommunications
companies there will be at the end of this, maybe five or six.
</P>
<P>
   But they will be able to serve their customers end-to-end with
their own plant. Long-distance carriers will not only have their
own domestic backbone, but also an international one.
</P>
<P>
   Qwest has that in mind. They have a nationwide network here and
are doing joint ventures internationally.
</P>
<P>
   Global Crossing is moving in the same direction: They are
building trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific cables and have
competitive local exchange plans for Europe.
</P>
<P>
   But we have years to go with the consolidation in this industry.
Some of the regulatory issues with AT&AMP;T alone are going to take
years to resolve. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Who are the survivors?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. MCI Worldcom is a survivor. They are further along in
assembling these kinds of assets around the world than anyone. AT&AMP;T
is another, although the joint venture approach they have
internationally makes things difficult. And British
Telecommunications would want to be a world player.

<P>
   DINGJIAERGOU, China _ In Ding Yaohong's tiny sitting room, mud
walls are etched with deep cracks and two tattered chairs vie for
space with roosting chickens, signs of this remote region's
desperate poverty. But the new centerpiece of the room, displacing
a small, rotting table, is the spine of an ancient spade-toothed
elephant _ recently unearthed evidence that Ding's hard homeland
may have some wealth to offer after all.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the farmers here struggled to coax wheat and corn to
grow on these arid, rocky hills, but the land gave little in
return. ``Plant a handful of seed and you get a handful of crops,''
a local saying goes.
</P>
<P>
   But recently this barren, brown wasteland has yielded a
lucrative new crop that stands to repay the generations of
suffering: a cache of nearly intact 15 million-year-old fossils,
which the villagers plan to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been digging for fossils for more than 10 years, but
this is the first time we've hit upon anything like this,'' Ding
said.
</P>
<P>
   His home is now littered with valuable specimens excavated in
the last two months, including prehistoric crocodiles, rhinos and
pigs. ``When the experts come to buy, I hope it will be a very good
harvest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As China has moved toward a market economy, peasants all over
rural China have had to devise ways to buy goods and services that
were once provided for free by the state, like education and
medicine. Where land is good they farm. Near cities, they turn to
migrant labor.
</P>
<P>
   But the village of Dingjiaergou, whose residents belong to
China's Hui Muslim minority (and are mostly surnamed Ding), is 15
miles from the nearest paved road. It is six hours by car from
Yinchuan, the sleepy provincial capital of the Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region, one of the poorest in China, with a per capita
income of less than $100 a year. The village got electricity
several years ago, but houses still lack running water, phones or
heat, even though winter temperatures drop well below zero.
</P>
<P>
   So peasants here have turned to large-scale fossil excavation to
make ends meet _ a unique if dangerous (and illegal) sideline.
</P>
<P>
   When not tending their crops, the men of Dingjiaergou can often
be found tunneling like groundhogs 10 feet under the region's
hills, in the hopes of finding ancient bones.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago Ding and 17 other villagers hit gold. They
burrowed their way into the underground cache. Now, the three-room
mud-brick house he shares with his wife and three children
resembles a museum storeroom, with the spine in the sitting room,
piles of skulls in the bedroom, and the huge-tusked skull of a
spade-toothed elephant blocking access to the family kang, a
traditional brick bed built over an oven to provide winter warmth.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have long known that this arid land in Tongxin County
was once a richly forested terrain, filled with lakes and rivers,
said Ye Jie, deputy director of the Institute of Vertebrate
Paleontology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s and '70s some farmers picked up spare cash by
digging up and selling ``dragon bones'' _ fossil shards used to
make traditional medicines for treating stomach troubles and scars.
In the next two decades, Chinese scientists occasionally made
research expeditions to this remote region, cataloguing its past.
</P>
<P>
   But farmers here say they only recently realized that there was
big money in excavations, and began carving out their peculiar
niche in China's emerging market economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, we didn't know how valuable this stuff
was,'' said Ding Yuzhu, a grizzled 50-year-old in a Mao jacket and
white skullcap.
</P>
<P>
   He said that in the last few years, Chinese scientists as well
as foreign experts had come to view _ and buy _ their wares. ``Now
we have discovered we could do this to make a living,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ding Yaohong, a burly man of 38, said that even before the major
discovery this spring, most of his income in recent years had come
from fossils. He makes about $35 a year from growing wheat and corn
_ and $125 a month selling the smaller fossils and bone shards he
unearthed in the past.
</P>
<P>
   With this year's jackpot, his second income stands to increase
many times. He and his partners say they will price the elephant
skull alone at $4,000 to $6,000. Ding says they plan to sell the
fossils to the Natural History Museum in Beijing, but experts
predict that many will end up on a lucrative black market.
</P>
<P>
   Neither farmers nor local officials seem terribly perturbed that
their digging is technically illegal. ``In fact we don't have much
choice,'' the older Ding said, ``since our land is so poor we would
starve otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   The officials have done little to intervene, noting that the
region's government does not have the money for proper excavation
anyhow.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many scientists are concerned that these amateur fossil
hunters may be destroying valuable scientific evidence with their
rudimentary picks and shovels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most scientists are opposed to this unscientific digging, even
though it has been a convenient way to get specimens,'' said Ye of
the Academy of Sciences. ``The peasants' goal is to sell fossils _
not to gather related scientific information _ so things are lost.
And because of their limited knowledge they often damage valuable
things which they think of as unimportant.''
</P>
<P>
   To get to the fossils, groups of villagers first dig a hole down
several yards into the earth, and then often tunnel laterally
hundreds of yards.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, the 18-man team from Dingjiaergou tunneled 500
yards before they found fossils, which Ding said could be
distinguished from the surrounding rocks by their color and also
their unique taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found so many things there,'' he said, ``but it was hard
since the tunnel was only 1.5 yards high _ you couldn't stand up
and only one person could go in at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Each fossil had to be dragged out of the narrow tunnel using
ropes. And scientists complain that the villagers inevitably chop
up large specimens to get them up through their maze, destroying
evidence in the process.
</P>
<P>
   It is a dangerous after-hours job that has killed two men from
Dingjiaergou in the last 10 years. Since there are no trees in this
desertlike region, tunnels are not reinforced by root networks and
are thus prone to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our first big find after years of looking,'' the elder
Ding said, ``and two people have died doing it. That's why the
bones are so expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   The villagers say that over the last few years, visiting experts
have taught them how to handle the fossils more carefully and
brought scientific charts that help them identify bones from
ancient mammals.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the fossils remain inscrutable to the peasants.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's that?'' a visitor asked, pointing to a pear-shaped
15-inch skull on the dirt floor, with dull yellow teeth protruding
at odd angles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh that, that's some kind of monster,'' the elder Ding said
with assurance.

   G8-KOSOVO _ COLOGNE, Germany _ At the opening of the Group of
Eight summit meeting here on Friday, National Security Advisor
Samuel E. Berger said the White House still is uncertain, a week
after the fact, why Russian troops deployed to Kosovo and what it
says about the state of Russian President Boris Yeltsin's control
there. The Clinton administration feels the troop decision was made
amid a fog of uncertainty inside Moscow and, as a result, the
United States is no longer sure quite what it's dealing with. Will

   CLINTON-G8 _ COLOGNE, Germany _ Bouyed by his leadership of a

and the fading echoes of his House impeachment six months ago
Saturday, President Clinton is projecting an air of fresh authority
at the annual summit of seven of the world's most powerful heads of
state. Walking tall among his counterparts, Clinton appeared
comfortably in control of the agenda Friday, as the G-7 leaders
opened a weekend of talks on issues ranging from Balkans
reconstruction to debt

baroque cupolas' graceful arches, landing on a cracked floor at the

   KOSOVO-KLA _ VERDAN, Yugoslavia _ German soldiers detained 25
ethnic Albanian rebels today after finding one elderly man dead and
more than 15 others hurt in a police station that had been under
control of the Kosovo Liberation Army since early this week. Most
of the victims seemed to be ethnic Albanians or Gypsies between the
ages of 50 and 60, said Lt. Col. Dietmar Jeserich, a spokesman for
the German army serving in the Kosovo peace force in the region.
The Kosovo Liberation Army moved Friday to repair its ties with
U.S. peacekeepers by promising to release five kidnapped hostages
who it described as Serb war criminals. A KLA brigade commander
said in an interview that he had told the top U.S. commander of the
82nd Airborne Division that from now on he was going to leave it up
to NATO investigate war crimes. Even with this development, NATO
faces problems trying to keep peace between the KLA and the Serbs.
In one region with 43 villages and 56,000 people, Americans are

   REVEREND-VIDEO _ ATLANTA _The Rev. Danny Bruce Moody, 52, pastor
of the Mount Carmel Baptist Church in Douglasville, Ga, was

has served as the church pastor for 24 years, and the congregation

   WASTE _ They couldn't stop the poop from getting in the water,
so now federal regulators are considering weakening the rules on
Florida utilities' widespread practice of pumping treated sewage
deep underground - waste that the feds acknowledge is seeping into
potential drinking water supplies. The U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency says the rules may be unreasonably strict, since
Florida's geology makes it impossible to guarantee that the waste
won't escape upward from the depths of the Floridan Aquifier. The
EPA insists it would make sure none of the waste is dangerous by
the time it reaches drinking water. But the idea horrifies
environmentalists. ``EPA's proposed solution is to legalize the
contamination rather than prevent it,'' says Suzi Ruhl of the Legal
Environmental Assistance Foundation, which has been fighting for
years to rein in the underground injections. Waste has shown up in
shallower monitor wells of Seacoast Utilities in northern Palm
Beach County and other areas around Flroida. (King, Palm Beach

Coalition, to introduce a new generation to Chaney's struggle for

   BULLOCK-OBIT _ AUSTIN _ Two unavoidable cliches: Former Lt. Gov.
Bob Bullock really was larger than life. And his death really does
mark the end of an era. Bullock died Friday morning at home,
surrounded by family. A first-generation Texan, Bullock fiercely
embraced the state's colorful history and did more than his part to
preserve and contribute to it. His temper could melt a brass
doorknob, but he was considerate of his friends. He could be
courtly and combative, gentlemanly and lewd, magnanimous and
unforgiving, humble and intimidating, persuasive and threatening _
all within seconds. He also pushed through monumental programs _
changing everything from the way Texas collects taxes to how it
funds its schools _ and never shied from a little political
bloodletting for what he believed to be in the best interest of
Texans. (Beach, Austin American-Statesman). WITH PHOTOS.

on Thursday. ``He said he was at peace with his maker and ready to
go, and one way or another, he would be set free tonight,'' Texas
Department of Criminal Justice Public Information Officer Larry

outlaw: ``Ask Larry Bird what a Knick is, senator. I'm sure they
have a clear idea.'' He then went on to call the San Antonio Spurs,
who are currently tangling with the New York Knicks for the
National Basketball Association Championship, ``those
tumbleweeds.'' Since the series began, harsh words and wagers have
been flying between the Empire State and the Lone Star state like
bullets in pistol duels. Gov. Bush is betting Gov. Pataki, and
mayors from New York and San Antonio are also laying it on the
line. (Davenport, Austin American-Statesman).

EMPLOYMENT IN BAY STATE AT HIGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The number of people employed in Massachusetts reached
yet another high _ 3.218 million _ despite a slowdown in job
growth, the state said Friday in its monthly employment report.
</P>
<P>
   While the report seemed to give out mixed signals, the
underlying message was positive: Massachusetts' economy is going
strong.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment rate edged up to 3.1 percent, from 2.9 percent
in April. But, the state's rate of joblessness still rests well
below the national jobless rate of 4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And while only 900 jobs were added in May _ down sharply from
7,600 jobs, the revised count for April _ the state over the past
four months has generated more than 24,000 new jobs, according to
the state's monthly survey of payrolls of nonfarm businesses
operating in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're almost pushed to the brink,'' said Elliot Winer,cq!
economist for the Massachusetts Division of Employment and
Training. ``You can't get many more people into the labor force
than you have.''
</P>
<P>
   The jobs report caps a week in which a series of developments
indicated that the US economy may be entering new terrain.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department reported inflation, after spiking in April
by 0.7 percent, was nonexistent last month. Nevertheless, Alan
Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, hinted in
public speeches during the week that he would seek to raise
interest rates, possibly at the next meeting of the Federal Open
Market Committee meeting June 29-30. Pressure on wages in an
ever-expanding economy are a key Fed concern, economists said.
</P>
<P>
   While Greenspan argued a Fed interest-rate hike would
``pre-empt'' future inflation, there are risks to a Fed strategy of
trying to cool down a sizzling economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you put on the brakes you can never tell if you're
going to skid,'' said Nicholas Perna, chief economist for Fleet
Financial Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
   An 0.2 percentage point rise in Massachusetts' unemployment
rate, to 3.1 percent in May, was blamed largely on the fact that
optimistic job hunters continue to stream into Massachusetts' labor
force, including retirees, out-of-staters, and students.
</P>
<P>
   The labor force had a ``sizable'' 5,500 gain in May _ on top of
a 8,100 gain in April _ according to the state's survey of
households. The household survey is used to calculate the
unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
   Services in Massachusetts, especially business services, had the
biggest job gains last month. Services added 2,400 jobs, according
the payroll survey.
</P>
<P>
   Other industries, including finance and wholesale trade, grew.
The exceptions were construction, which lost 800 jobs in May, and
manufacturing, which lost 600 jobs.

CLINTON VOWS TO FIRE BACK IN AFTERMATH OF HOUSE VOTE ON GUN
CONTROL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOGNE, Germany _ Firing a warning shot across the Atlantic
Ocean, President Clinton on Friday vowed to ratchet up his fight
for gun control in the aftermath of the House defeat of its gun
measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This week instead of listening to the American people and
strengthening our gun laws, the House of Representatives listened
to the gun lobby and did nothing at all,'' said the president, who
is meeting with the leaders of industrialized nations. ``The House
leadership gutted this bill in the dark of night to keep
common-sense gun legislation from seeing the light of day.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement was issued after the House killed a bill that
contained a weak gun-control measure opposed by many Democrats and
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Since he left for Europe on Tuesday, Clinton has been paying
close attention to the gun-control issue and telephoned wavering
Democrats to lobby them to support restrictions that include
background checks at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   When the House, shortly before midnight, approved a watered down
version of the gun-show provision the president denounced the vote
and attributed it to the clout of the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   The president also acknowledged the resistance to gun-control
measures in the United States as he met with leaders of nations
with generally tougher gun restrictions and lower crime rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is a great country, but it is the only
country in the world that's still living as if you don't have to
take reasonable precautions to keep guns out of the hands of
children and criminals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said the House defeat had only spurred him to work
harder for tougher gun legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just getting warmed up,'' he said after meeting with
British Prime Minister Tony Blair ``I'm energized for the fight,
and I hope Carol McCarthy is and Sarah Brady and all of our
allies.'' Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., who lost her husband to
gun violence, was the sponsor of the failed anti-gun measure
favored by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The House narrowly approved a less restrictive measure favored
by the NRA and sponsored by another Democratic House member, Rep.
John Dingell of Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   But liberal House Democrats, angry at the defeat of the gun
measure, later joined with conservative Republicans to defeat the
entire gun-control bill.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said the president would
begin waging his counteroffensive Saturday by devoting his radio
address to the gun-control issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president will use his weekly radio address to
reiterate the fact that this fight over sensible gun control has
just begun and we're going to continue until the American public
gets what they deserve,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was less critical of another measure approved by the
House, which would let public schools post copies of the Ten
Commandments. While the president said he believed the provisions
faced constitutional hurdles, he added that he understood the need
to teach students about character building.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea that the schools ought to build the character of
children I think is a good idea,'' he said after a meeting with
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder. ``But it ought to be done in a
way that respects the wide diversity of our student body and that
doesn't lead to a long drawn-out legal challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   The House actions were prompted by the April killings at
Columbine High School in Colorado, which many liberals attributed
to the easy access to guns and conservatives blamed on too much
violence in the media and the lack of ethics among young people.
</P>
<P>
   The White House immediately seized on the gun-control issue in
the aftermath of the shootings and polls showed the public
overwhelmingly supporting modest restrictions on firearms.
</P>
<P>
   The gun-control debate appeared to be going the administration's
way last month when the Senate reversed itself and approved tougher
gun restrictions favored by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton blamed his reversal of fortune in the House on the NRA,
which he maintained convinced GOP leaders to postpone the vote so
they could whip up gun owners' opposition to the measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NRA can always produce several hundred phone calls for
every one an ordinary citizen can make,'' he said. ``They did win,
and it's a great tribute to their money and their power; but it's
not a tribute to the children or the future of America ... So one
more time the Congress of the United States, with the majority in
the lead, says, we don't care what's necessary to protect our
children, we can't possibly bear to make anyone in the NRA mad.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that House Republican leaders waited until ``the dark of
the night'' to take the vote on the gun-show measure to avoid the
publicity of defeating a popular measure.

   Clinton was less harsh in his assessment of Dingell, saying he
has an ``honest disagreement'' with the liberal Democrat who is
also a member of the NRA. And Lockhart said ``the opposition was
really led by a small group of the Republican leadership.''

POSTSEASON CHALLENGE DOESN'T GET ANY TOUGHER FOR SABRES 
</HEADLINE>

   DALLAS _ They faced a huge obstacle when they were matched up
against No. 2 seed Ottawa in the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   They faced another when they had a long layoff and were pitted
against the surging Bruins. Another hurdle came in the form of
having to shut down the highest-scoring team in the NHL, the
Toronto Maple Leafs.
</P>
<P>
   Through those challenges, the tenacity and teamwork of the
Buffalo Sabres shone through while they overcame all of them.
</P>
<P>
   Now they face their biggest challenge of the postseason. After
being shut out by the Dallas Stars in Game 5 Thursday night, the
Sabres trail the best-of-seven Stanley Cup finals, 3-2, and face
elimination at home Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The series has been so close, with a paper-thin margin
separating the teams in each of the five games. There have been
momentum shifts that have come from moment to moment, period to
period, and game to game. But with Dallas needing only one more
victory in the next two games, there was a quiet confidence
emanating from the Dallas dressing room Thursday night and a quiet
desperation coming from the Sabres'.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought both teams emotionally really gave it everything
they had,'' said Sabres coach Lindy Ruff. ``It was a lot of emotion
out there on both sides and it was tight as tight could be. Not a
lot of ice for either team.''
</P>
<P>
   The difference in the game proved to be Darryl Sydor's
power-play goal at 2:23 of the middle period, which held up as the
winner, and Pat Verbeek closed it out at 15:21 of the third at even
strength.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't really done much, I guess, offensively,'' said
Sydor, who had no points in the series' first four games. ``But
that is one thing I have learned over my years, not to really get
down or try to force things. It was a battle out there and every
shift is so intense. This is the time of year that everyone wants
to play.''
</P>
<P>
   It was goalie Ed Belfour's third shutout of the playoffs and
seventh of his career. So much has been written about the play of
Dominik Hasek, but on Thursday night, Belfour was calm, cool, and
collected and is one victory away from his first Stanley Cup. Hasek
has a better save percentage (.937 to Belfour's .925 but Belfour's
goals-against average is 1.76 to Hasek's 1.85.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eddie has been playing unbelieveable for us,'' said Sydor.
``He has been in a shadow of a lot of goaltenders and I think he
has really, really taken that as motivation to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, Hasek hasn't played badly. He didn't have a chance on
either of the Stars' goals. Hasek said he expects his team to come
back with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can I say; we tried the whole game,'' he said. ``We had a
couple of chances. I think both teams had not too many chances.
They scored the first goal on the power play and it was probably
the difference in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   History favors the Stars, who were the NHL's best regular-season
team. In the 15 times the finals have been tied at 2-2, the club
winning Game 5 has gone on to win the Cup 12 times. The last team
to lose a fifth game and win the Cup was the 1971 Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
   The area in which the Sabres were so strong during the first
three rounds, the power play, has disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars held the Sabres without a power play in all three of
their chances in Game 5, stretching their consecutive number of
kills to 17. The last time the Stars allowed Buffalo to score a
power-play goal was in the third period of Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   While the Sabres try to find a way to turn that around, the
Stars said they fully expect that Game 6 will be their finest hour.
If that's the case, it could well mark the end of Buffalo's
impressive run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect nothing less than our best game,'' said Stars
forward Jamie Langenbrunner. We will be excited to play. I am sure
that we will play our best game.''
</P>
<P>
   Dallas is the more seasoned team, predicted to be a Cup
contender even before the Stars finished with the best
regular-season record. Call them experienced but don't call them
old.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we lose, automatically, our age becomes a factor,'' said
veteran forward Mike Keane. ``Right now, we're feeling very fresh.
Any time we lose, we're an old club. Big deal. I don't care how old
this club is. We're one win away from a Cup and I don't think
anyone feels old now.''

THE REPLAY OF TRAGEDY AS FARCE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 20, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIMOLEAGUE, Ireland _ When the 17th century British burned the
Catholic monastery that had guarded the tidal riverfront here since
the 12th century, the intent was to destroy a symbol as much as an
edifice of stone and wood.
</P>
<P>
   The stones still stand, impervious to fire as well as ire, and
the bygones are bygones. On Ireland's balmy south coast, at least,
if not in the rockier and more hostile turf of the still-Balkanized
North, tribes of different antecedents prosper and proliferate.
</P>
<P>
   But word of the systematic destruction of symbols still reaches
the peaceful tourist towns, whether it be a church arson or a
pub-bombing in Ulster, the demented bloodletting in the Balkans, or
the destruction of more benign symbols by British newspapers for
something so banal as profit.
</P>
<P>
   In the same week I circumlocuted the fishing spots of Ireland's
southwest, the British newspapers were agog with three scandals,
each of which falls into the category of destroying contemporary
symbols for profit.
</P>
<P>
   Every press baron has his foibles, but Rupert Murdoch, the
Australian whose business skills and journalisitic mendacity have
made him the world's premier media buccaneer encouraged one of his
saffron-tinted editors (that's a boss of yellow journalists) at his
tabloid Sun to run an 11-year-old snapshot of a royal fiancee shorn
of half her bathing-suit top.
</P>
<P>
   Coming in the run-up to the royal wedding, the insult could not
have been timed better to infuriate supporters of the beleaguered
royal family, which has been carpet-bombed by Murdoch's
hydra-headed News Corp. outlets ever since he realized there was
money to be made in denigrating high society.
</P>
<P>
   By paying a large sum, speculated to be in the vicinity of
$160,000, Murdoch's Sun bought a snapshot taken over a decade ago,
when Sophie Rhys-Jones was skylarking on a trip in Spain, and the
fellow in the back seat snapped her bra, and the lady in front
snapped the picture. From such old and innocent horseplay the Sun
ran a photo of a now-mature woman who's engaged to Prince Edward,
her breast bared in four million copies of Murdoch's rag.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch's campaign to bury Britain's royal family in
newspaper-selling smut is a long-running soap opera. To say people
were disgusted at the Sun's gaucherie is to understate the
reaction. ``Reprehensible,'' sniffed the quasi-official Press
Complaints Commission.
</P>
<P>
   It was another Murdoch tabloid, the News of the World, that
entrapped a prominent British athletic hero, and goaded him into
bragging about exploits selling drugs and chasing loose women in
Amsterdam. The rather simple-minded and single-minded captain of
Britain's world-class rugby team, Lawrence Dallaglio, was
apparently so intent on impressing his duplicitous inquisitors that
he bragged of all sorts of racy indiscretions. He was tape-recorded
over four hours in a hotel room with reporters, one of them an
attractive female, pretending to offer him a lucrative endorsement
contract.
</P>
<P>
   When the ``story'' was published, on the eve of a widely
publicized world rugby tour by the national team, the captain was
forced to resign in disgrace, with the Lords of Rugby tut-tutting
about how they could not afford to have a one-time drug hustler
captaining the national squad. Another tabloid victim bites the
dust ``the supposed admissions . . . amounted to an elaborate
set-up by the writers of the News of the World . . . to which I
fell victim.''
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch reappears again in the third episode of manufactured
disgrace. His Sunday Times paid a large sum to a gossip columnist
for a rival paper to print her lengthy recounting of her 27-year
affair as mistress of former Irish government leader Charlie
Haughey.
</P>
<P>
   By spilling the sordid beans in his Times, Murdoch's
hench-editors held the randy Haughey up to ridicule, and themselves
up to scorn. For a sum speculated to be around $90,000, the
ex-mistress, Terry Keane, spread venom, as vulgar as it was
vengeful, with such obvious spite that the most-unlikely result
eventuated:
</P>
<P>
   A wave of sympathy enveloped not only the harried and hapless
Haughey, who's up to his ears in financial as well as sexual
scandal, but also his long-suffering wife and his adult children,
all of whom behaved with far more grace and taste than Keane, her
journalistic Johns at the Times, or the Grand Titillator Himself,
Rupert the Tasteless.
</P>
<P>
   He's also on the verge of becoming Rupert the Wifeless. His
second wife, Anna, is in court divorcing him. Rupert has a new lady
friend, a 31-year-old employee of his octopus-like organization.
``How would you like to see your lover nude on Page 3, Mr.
Murdoch?'' demanded a headline in the rival Daily Telegraph, whose
owner, Canadian Conrad Black, likes the royal family as much as he
dislikes Murdoch.
</P>
<P>
   Murdoch not only revels but prospers in poking his thumb in the
eye of symbolic figures, tempting targets whose feet he is
determined to show are naught but common clay. The consumers whose
newspapers and TV diets are increasingly dictated by Murdoch's
gargantuan News Corp. have less and less chance to avoid his
thumb-in-the-eyeball journalism, which coarsens taste and elevates
lowbrow sentiment in print as well as on broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   This tropism toward tabloidism has crossed the pond, with a big
boost from the Murdoch wanna-bes who increasingly dominate American
journalism. It is now being documented that the Monica-mania of
America's media has cost us news outfits circulation and audience
share, not to mention respect. The journalism that was our best and
brightest is turning base and brassy.
</P>
<P>
   Brawny Bob Woodward was the Washington Post's big-game hunter
who bagged Tricky Dick in Watergate. He's back now on the Clinton
beat, but Bob's quarry is now the yeasty gossip-pit of Bill &AMP; Hill,
Monica and Linda, Whitewater and wet dreams. The replay of tragedy
as farce is a plot older than the Timoleague abbey. Murdoch remains
journalism's pace-setter. No matter how low you think we can go,
Rupert can always go you one lower.

HELMS APPEARS READY TO ALLOW APPOINTMENT OF HOLBROOKE TO U.N. 
</HEADLINE>
 (rm) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Richard C. Holbrooke appeared near victory in his
year-long struggle for confirmation as chief American diplomat to
the United Nations when the chairman of the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee, Jesse Helms, suggested Friday that Senate
approval of the nomination was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Helms, who until Friday had left open the possibility that he
might kill the nomination through procedural tactics, said in a
speech on the Senate floor that Holbrooke ``probably will be
confirmed in a week or so as the new U.S. ambassador to the United
Nations.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms was seen as the last major hurdle in Holbrooke's struggle
for the U.N. post, which has been vacant since Bill Richardson left
the job last September to become energy secretary. On Thursday,
other members of the committee signaled their support for his
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional officials said that Helms, the fiercely
conservative North Carolina Republican, appeared to have been
satisfied by Holbrooke's acknowledgment in Senate testimony on
Thursday that his carelessness led to ``misperceptions'' about his
ethics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jesse wanted contrition from Holbrooke and he got it,'' said a
congressional aide.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, a veteran diplomat turned investment banker, paid
$5,000 to the Justice Department in February to settle civil
charges that he had violated federal lobbying laws in his contacts
with American diplomats in South Korea after he resigned from the
State Department in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Helms had said on June 4, when he announced that his committee
was ready to hold confirmation hearings, that he could not recall
another Cabinet-level nomination before the panel ``with so much
ethical baggage.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration and congressional officials said Helms was also
pleased by Holbrooke's vow at the confirmation hearing on Thursday
that he would make reform of the United Nations his ``highest
sustained priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Helms is the Senate's leading critic of the United Nations and
has demanded a streamlining of the organization's bureaucracy. In
his Senate speech Friday, the senator noted approvingly that
Holbrooke ``strongly favors the reform of the United Nations.''
</P>
<P>
   The senator's comments Friday suggested that he would allow the
Foreign Relations Committee to vote on the nomination as early as
next week, clearing the way for final Senate confirmation a few
days later and for Holbrooke to take up his duties in New York this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke faces two more hearings before the committee next
week, one on Tuesday focusing on U.N. reform and the last one on
Thursday about his role in policymaking in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been without a so-called permanent
representative, the title given to the senior American diplomat
assigned to the United Nations, during most of a tumultuous year in
American foreign policy, including the Kosovo crisis and the
showdown with Iraq that led to several days of American-led air
strikes on Baghdad last December.
</P>
<P>
   There has been an acting permanent representative at the United
Nations, A. Peter Burleigh, a respected career diplomat, but
Clinton administration officials say American foreign policy has
been hindered by the lack of a figure of Holbrooke's stature and
celebrity in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, the former ambassador to Germany, was the architect
of the 1995 peace agreement that ended the war in Bosnia, and he is
close to both President Clinton and Vice President Gore. Within the
administration, senior officials often speak of Holbrooke as a
likely secretary of state if Gore is elected president.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   If Helms decides to vote for Holbrooke's confirmation, the
nomination may well be approved unanimously by the Foreign
Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   At the opening confirmation hearing on Thursday, senators other
than Helms, Democrats and Republicans alike, praised Holbrooke
enthusiastically, and his broad bipartisan support was made clear
by the fact that he was introduced at the hearing by the Republican
chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, John W. Warner of
Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot think of another individual whom I have known in a
public service career in national security matters, foreign affairs
matters, for over 30 years who is better qualified or has had more
experience to take on this position,'' Warner said of Holbrooke.
``I think he's eminently qualified.''

SORE CHIN, LOTS OF MONEY IN STORE FOR SAVARESE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Lou Savarese is being paid a million dollars to fight
Michael Grant Saturday night at Madison Square Garden. He is not
being paid to beat him.
</P>
<P>
   Savarese understands that because he is a professional and has
been around the fight game a long time but he doesn't accept it. To
win is not supposed to be his role when this passion play unfolds
on HBO sometime around midnight, but it is his goal despite other's
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   He has been brought here to lose to Grant, who is considered the
hottest prospect in the heavyweight division in large part because
he is 6 feet 7 inches, 257 pounds and looks as if he could play
power forward for the Spurs if he decided to. But Lou Savarese will
tell you he's looking pretty good these days himself, down to 240
pounds after spending months working with Evander Holyfield's
physical trainer, Tim Hallmark, and is himself ready to win again.
</P>
<P>
   He is fit and he is ready to fire, he believes. Whether that
makes a difference to Grant or not only time will tell but for the
moment at least Savarese believes a mistake was made in casting
either by Grant's manager or his promoter or HBO, which has Grant
signed to a long-term television deal.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever made the mistake, if indeed there has been one, is of no
concern to him. His only concern is hitting in the chin an opponent
who, according to CompuBox statistics gets, hit 48 percent of the
time he's in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   This has not yet meant a thing to Grant, who is 29-0 with 21
knockouts but it means something to Savarese, who is 39-2 himself
with 32 of those wins coming by putting his opponent to sleep. It
means something because he has been put to sleep himself in the
ring once so he understands what Michael Grant does not. He
understands you don't want to get hit 48 percent of the time you're
in the ring with heavyweights because if you do, eventually you
will go to sleep for a few seconds yourself and nothing will be the
same for you after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I match up good with the guy,'' Savarese said of Grant while
also acknowledging Grant's punching power and apparently stiff
chin. ``I do best against guys who are big and strong and don't
move much. Grant is right in front of you. He doesn't move his feet
too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Only, Grant might say, when he has to get out of the way of a
falling opponent, which is what he and trainer Don Turner assume
will be the position Savarese eventually takes at 33rd and
Broadway, because Savarese has already had the tar beaten out of
him by George Foreman two years ago and since has been KO'd by
journeyman David Izon (whom Grant knocked out in five rounds) and
been in dire straits against Lance Whitaker in March before
reluctantly getting off the floor to win a 10-round decision.
</P>
<P>
   Savarese understands this is their thinking. He understands much
of the boxing public views things the same way. But what he also
understands is none of that will matter unless he agrees with them,
which for the moment at least he does not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grant is a very good fighter,'' Savarese said. ``He's
well-schooled and he's very relaxed in there. I gotta do what I can
do to make him not so relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   What Savarese intends to do is punch Grant in the face as often
as possible in the hopes that eventually this will not be to
Grant's liking. More to the point, he hopes a series of such
punches will send Grant to a place he knows nothing about _
boxing's dark room, where the sound of Chinese chimes go off in
your head and the next thing you hear is a referee saying, ``. . .
six . . . seven.''
</P>
<P>
   If Lou Savarese can do that, he's been told, he might be the
next opponent to challenge WBC champion Lennox Lewis, who will be
at ringside to study both fighters as possible challengers if a
rematch with Evander Holyfield can't be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   Grant knows this as well but neither fighter is talking about it
much. Grant isn't talking because he's still young and caught up in
the moment and not concerned about what might follow it. Savarese
isn't talking about it because he's older and has heard such talk
before and knows it means nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the heavyweight champion of short lists,'' Savarese said,
alluding to past times when his name has been mentioned as a
possible challenger for the heavyweight title only to never see
those fights materialize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something's always coming next fight. I don't let that affect
me anymore. A day is a year in this business. You never know how
it's going to be tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Lou Savarese hopes Michael Grant will learn that for the first
time when he wakes up to a new day and a sore chin.

RICHARD SMITH QUITTING CEO POST AT HARCOURT GENERAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Richard Smith is retiring for the second time as chief
executive of Harcourt General Inc. The 74-year-old Smith will stay
on as chairman of the textbook publishing and retail firm, while
handing off the CEO duties to his son and son-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Smith and Brian Knez will serve as co-CEOs beginning
November 1. Both men have been carefully groomed for their new
roles. Smith and Knez presently share the office of chief operating
officer of Harcourt General. They're also co-CEOs of the company's
Neiman Marcus retailing unit and the Harcourt publishing operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our way of passing the torch, so to speak,'' Richard
Smith said. ``The guys are ready. Robert Smith and Brian Knez are
absolutely ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Smith served as CEO from 1961 to 1991, resuming the job
in 1997 after the resignation of his successor Robert Tarr Jr. He
said his departure would not signal any dramatic changes in
strategy. ``There'll be no change really in the way the company
will be run in the immediate future,'' said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Harcourt will follow through on a plan announced in May to spin
off its 54 percent stake in Neiman Marcus to form a new,
independent company, which would remain under its existing
management. Richard Smith said that creating two separate
publishing and retail businesses would lead to a fairer -- and
higher -- market valuation for Harcourt General's assets.
</P>
<P>
   News of the personnel changes was greeted calmly on Wall Street,
where Harcourt General stock rose 5/16 to 50 15/16 on the New York
Stock Exchange. ``The market's been anticipating this for awhile,''
said Peter Appert, media analyst at Deutsche Banc Alex Brown in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Smith's family holds 28 percent of Harcourt General's
stock. Smith said he will continue to play an active role as
chairman, partly because so much of his family's fortune is bound
up in the firm.

U.S. AND RUSSIA STRIKE DEAL ON RUSSIAN TROOPS IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOGNE, Germany _ The United States and Russia agreed late
Friday to award Russian troops a prominent role in peacekeeping
operations in Kosovo one week after Russian troopers defied NATO
and seized the largest airfield in the bloodied Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, reached by U.S. and Russian negotiators in
Helsinki, Finland, cleared the way for a summit meeting Sunday
between President Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin here
in Cologne.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who is attending the annual summit of the world's seven
most powerful industrialized democracies here, said he was ``very
pleased'' with the outcome of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a good day _ we are achieving our objectives,''
Clinton said. ``We know that we have 35,000 Serb forces out, 19,000
KFOR forces in. Now we have the agreement with the Russians and the
Kosovars are going home,'' Clinton said. ``I feel very good and
very grateful for their (Russia's) support.''
</P>
<P>
   KFOR is the acronym for the peace-keeping force led by the
United States and other members of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   A senior White House official said 3,600 Russian troops will be
deployed in Kosovo ``within the KFOR command structure'' and within
the chain of military command of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
   A total of 2,850 Russian troops will patrol geographic areas
within three sectors supervised by the United States, France and
Germany. The remaining 750 Russian troops will administer and
provide security for the airfield in the Kosovo capital of
Pristina, located in the British sector. Russian forces must permit
all nations' forces to use the facility.
</P>
<P>
   That same airfield has been under Russian control since last
Friday when Russian troops rushed from peacekeeping duties in
Bosnia _ another province of the former Yugoslavia _ and into
Kosovo to seize the airfield.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, right after the Yugoslav government had agreed to
withdraw from Kosovo and NATO had ended its bombing campaign, NATO
and Russian officials were still debating what role Russia should
play in Kosovo. The hangup was NATO's insistence that Russian
troops operate under NATO command.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's surprise move of troops to the Pristina airport led to
the Helsinki agreement reached Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the Russians' presence is needed to help allay the
concerns of Serbian civilians and protect Serbian religious and
cultural sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's quite important that every effort be made to
secure both the physical sites and the personal security of the
Serb minority as well as the Kosovar Albanian majority,'' Clinton
said. ``We think it will give confidence to (Serbs) that the
Russians are in more than one sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia and Serbia, which share religious and ethnic ties, have
been long-standing allies.
</P>
<P>
   The senior White House official, speaking on condition of
anonymity, insisted the Russian troops will be joining a NATO-led
operation working from a NATO operational plan that will carry out
peacekeeping operations ``with a common command and common rules of
engagement.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russian force, consisting of five battalions, will join the
50,000-strong international security force in Kosovo known as KFOR
but will be commanded by Russian officers. Russian officers also
will serve as liaisons at KFOR headquarters in Pristina; NATO
regional headquarters in Naples, Italy; and NATO military
headquarters in Mons, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've said all along we want Russians to participate and we
think it will be a stronger and better force,'' the senior White
House official said, adding that there will be ``no Russian sector
and no partition'' of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement was reached in negotiations in Helsinki that
included Defense Secretary William Cohen and Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright bargaining with the Russian defense minister,
Marshall Igor Sergeyev, and Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev said the 3,600 Russian troops will ``remain under the
complete military and political control of the Russian side.''
</P>
<P>
   The senior White House official in Cologne said if a nation's
forces declined to carry out an order within KFOR ``for any
reason,'' the KFOR commander was authorized to dispatch other
nations' troops to complete the task.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The compromise was designed to enable Yeltsin to claim that
Russian peacekeeping troops will serve as independent partners with
allied forces in Kosovo. The compromise also sought to provide the
U.S.-dominated 19-nation NATO alliance the unified chain of command
that it insisted was needed to guarantee the effectiveness and
neutrality of a peacekeeping force that is needed to encourage the
return of an estimated 1.6 million ethnic Albanian Muslim refugees
uprooted by Serbian ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   The deal eased U.S.-Russian tensions that had been growing
during the U.S.-led 78-day bombing of Yugoslavia and the expansion
of NATO to include Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic _ three
former nations of the Soviet-led Warsaw Pact.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the Helsinki agreement was reached, National
Security Adviser Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger expressed concern about
the Russians' ambiguous explanations for the surprise seizure of
the Pristina airfield.
</P>
<P>
   Berger conceded that the White House still does not know the
truth behind the Kremlin's mysterious decision to take control of
the airfield.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's foreign minister had assured Albright at one point last
Friday that the movement was a mistake and would be reversed. His
assurances raised the specter that Russia's nuclear-equipped armed
forces might have acted independently beyond the constraints of
civilian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Kremlin leaders later said that Yeltsin had given the order to
military leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of different possibilities about who
ordered what when, and who knew what when, what did he know and
when did he know it,'' Berger said. He declined to speculate about
why ``Russian soldiers wound up at the airport when they were not
supposed to be there and why we were told that they would not
deploy and they deployed nonetheless,'' adding: ``There are, as I
say, a number of possible scenarios and I think we have to be wise
enough to contemplate all of them.''

THE BROTHERS QUINN EXPLORE THEIR IRISH ROOTS IN `FATHER'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Aidan Quinn ambles up to the table to join Paul Quinn for a
late breakfast at a Dallas hotel restaurant, there's no doubt that
the two are brothers. Both have the same steely eyes, the same
Midwestern baritones, the same cadences to their sentences. They
both sport goatees that offset sharp features, inspiring a joking
comment about how they vaguely resemble bikers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played a biker in `Leaving Las Vegas,' '' Paul Quinn pipes
up, amused. ``I beat up Nicolas Cage.''
</P>
<P>
   Aidan Quinn then mentions that he still has the bike he rode in
1984's ``Reckless,'' his first film. ``I love that bike, man,''
Quinn says.
</P>
<P>
   The only bikes you'll find in the Quinns' latest movie, ``This
Is My Father,'' are the unmotorized kind. ``Father'' stars James
Caan as a depressed Chicago schoolteacher who travels to Ireland to
learn about the father he never knew. The movie switches between
the present and 1939, telling of a star-crossed romance between a
poor tenant farmer named Kieran O'Day and the younger,
free-spirited Fiona Flynn.
</P>
<P>
   For the Quinns, ``Father'' gives new meaning to ``family film.''
Paul Quinn wrote the movie, inspired by a story the Quinns' mother
told them about events in her Irish village. He also directed, with
Aidan Quinn in the role of Kieran O'Day. Another brother, Declan
Quinn, did the film's sterling cinematography. Even sister Marian
has a small role in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   The Quinns believe that their labor of love is a family film in
another way, too _ it's a family film that is suitable for
teen-agers. They're stunned that the gentle movie, with its tiny
doses of sex and violence, received an R rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sensitizing film,'' Paul Quinn says. ``It makes people
go through a catharsis and have to face some of their own pain
about being left alone and abandoned, and their father issues. A
lot of men I know, boy, this film hits 'em hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Aidan is the more famous Quinn, Paul is the more
loquacious. As a writer, he tries to pack a lot into ``Father's''
screenplay, including material about the Catholic Church's
influence in midcentury Ireland, class structure and the immigrant
experience.
</P>
<P>
   The Quinns want to make it clear that the father in the movie
isn't their father. Kieran O'Day, the title character, is somewhat
slow-witted; the Quinns' father is an erudite, retired English
professor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very interested in knowledge,'' Paul says. ``He got me
interested in literature. But not right away. I resisted him for
ages. Once I sort of relented, I really just became obsessed with
reading fiction. He's got a massive library. He's an Irish scholar.
... I was drawing pictures of James Joyce when I was 8 years old.
It's kind of a strange thing to be doing, in retrospect.''
</P>
<P>
   You could hardly call the Quinns a ``show-biz'' family along the
lines of the Baldwin brothers, but the Quinns' close upbringing
helped give them a sort of unspoken shorthand on the set of
``Father.'' It helped that they share a curiosity about their Irish
roots.
</P>
<P>
   Paul wants to do a movie that's more specifically about his
parents' experiences _ about their move from Ireland to the States
in the '50s, when they became active in Kennedy-era Democratic
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I showed (''This Is My Father'') to them, it was one of
the great thrills I ever got,'' Paul Quinn says. ``It was sort of a
rough cut, two Thanksgivings ago. My mom's face was wet. My dad
walked in the kitchen _ he would nod affirmatively as he walked
into the kitchen to have a cry. It was great to see that and effect
that. And part of it, I think, is that they were really proud of us
pulling it together, and proud that the Ireland they knew was on
the screen and it wasn't some characterization they would have been
offended by.''

CONGRESS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PASS GUN-CONTROL LEGISLATION  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: See optional trims) 
 
By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House rejected a major gun-control bill Friday,
raising the possibility that lawmakers may not be able to produce
legislation this year in the wake of the Colorado school tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   Dealing a blow to Clinton administration efforts to force
background checks on firearms purchases at gun shows, flea markets
and pawn shops, lawmakers voted 280-147 against passage of a
Republican-sponsored bill that gun-control advocates feared would
not go far enough in limiting access to weapons by criminals and
children. The bill dealt with gun shows but would have weakened
existing laws governing background checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people will not stand for this'' President
Clinton said in a statement. ``Our nation is waiting for Washington
to pass a real law that keeps guns away from children and out of
the hands of criminals. I call on the Congress to stop playing
politics and start living up to its responsibility to help save
lives.''
</P>
<P>
   But House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., accused the Democrats
of turning their backs on ``a sensible'' gun-control measure when
they had the chance to pass the first significant bill dealing with
firearms legislation since Congress banned the sale of assault
weapons in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let there be no mistake,'' Hastert countered, ``the vast
majority of the Democrat caucus walked away when they had the
chance to walk forward for the good of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   All but 10 Democrats did end up voting against the bill, but so
did 82 Republicans, who rejected Hastert's pleas that they rally
behind some form of gun control to show their concern about what
happened two months ago in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All 17 Texas Democrats voted against the bill, as did
Republicans Kevin Brady of The Woodlands, Joe Barton of Dallas,
Larry Combest of Lubbock, Sam Johnson of Plano, Ron Paul of
Surfside and Mac Thornberry of Clarendon.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the House bill found particularly objectionable a
provision approved late Thursday night by a vote of 218-211 that
would have extended the current instant background check to guns
sold by unlicensed dealers at firearms shows, but set a deadline of
only 24 hours for completing checks before the purchaser got the
gun anyway.

   All 13 of the Texas Republicans voted for that provision, the
state's Democrats split over it, with nine of them also voting in
favor of it. They were Reps. Gene Green of Houston, Max Sandlin, of
Marshall, Ciro Rodriguez of San Antonio, Jim Turner of Crockett,
Solomon Ortiz of Corpus Christi, Nick Lampson of Beaumont, Ralph
Hall of Rockwall, Silvestre Reyes of El Paso and Charles Stenholm

   President Clinton and Democratic leaders had been pushing for at
least a three-business-day period for checks at guns shows, which
is the requirement now under the Brady law for purchases made
through licensed dealers.
</P>
<P>
   They called the 24-hour provision, which was sponsored by Rep.
John Dingell, D-Mich., ``a ruse'' that would really undermine the
Brady law on background checks while appearing to crackdown on
unlicensed dealers.
</P>
<P>
   They also charged that the Dingell amendment and the underlying
House gun-control bill, which would have still allowed nine or
fewer unlicensed sellers to hold a gun show without having to
conduct any background checks, was ghostwritten by lobbyists with
the National Rifle Association.
</P>
<P>
   The claim was not disputed by NRA representatives who
acknowledged that many of their ``suggestions and proposals'' were
accepted by Dingell and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry
Hyde, R-Ill., who authored the larger bill that would have exempted
background checks at gatherings of fewer than 10 gun sellers.
</P>
<P>
   The rejection of the Hyde bill ended an emotional three-day
debate among Republicans and Democrats on the House floor trying to
come to grips with the shooting and bombing incident last April at
Columbine High School in Colorado that killed 15 people and wounded
21 others.
</P>
<P>
   The vote leaves the fate of gun-control legislation uncertain
for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate has approved a much stronger gun-control measure as
part of a larger juvenile crime bill. The House has also passed a
separate $1.5 billion juvenile justice measure designed to crack
down on minors who commit violent crimes. But without a significant
gun-control element as part of it, the two chambers may not be able
to settle on a final piece of legislation that President Clinton
will be willing to sign.
</P>
<P>
   Other provisions in the House juvenile crime bill may also make
it difficult to reach a compromise. For example, the House bill
contains a provision that would allow the states to display the Ten
Commandments in classrooms and government buildings, a move that
its Republican sponsor said is aimed at helping to restore ``a
sense of morality'' to the nation's young people.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton praised the idea behind the religious amendment,
he said he would encourage legislators to explore ``another
option'' that would not prompt a court challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many in the Senate _ Democrats and Republicans alike _
find the provision objectionable. There also are disagreements over
how severe the penalties should be for minors who commit violent
acts and whether prosecutors instead of judges should decide
whether to try minors as adults in extreme cases _ as the House
bill requires _ where the juvenile punishment system doesn't seem
to fit the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Democratic leaders said they were still hopeful
that a juvenile justice bill could be produced in conference that
includes ``meaningful'' gun-control measures.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., said the main focus
for Democratic conferees would be ``getting closer'' to the
Senate-passed provisions on gun control, which would ban large
capacity ammunition clips, require safety locks to be sold with
handguns, and extend the three-business-day background checks to
all unlicensed dealers at gun shows and other venues where weapons
are sold.
</P>
<P>
   But that could be a problem, since the House also rejected
242-182 Friday a similar bill containing the Senate language.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, who led the fight to
prevent the Senate provisions from passing in the House, said
Republicans would still try to get some kind of gun-control bill
through conference. But he acknowledged that it would likely be
``difficult'' given the great differences that exist among
lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, there were things in this (House) bill that were
not philosophically palatable for Democrats and Republicans
alike,'' he said. ``There were votes against this on both sides of
the aisle, for reasons having to do with personal philosophy, not
party politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the votes on the Dingell measure and the larger Hyde
bill were seen as victories for the NRA, which spent some $1.5
million trying to defeat the gun-control bills in both the House
and Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also acknowledged defeat for the time being, telling
reporters that the NRA had succeeded _ with the help of
conservative Republicans _ in turning the debate over gun control
into a debate over cultural problems that contribute to violence.
</P>
<P>
   But neither the president nor gun-control lawmakers were ready
to give up on efforts to enact legislation this year.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, told reporters. ``This issue
is not going away ... and those of us who care about the safety of
our children are not going away.''
</P>
<P>
   In a speech before Friday's final vote on the gun-control bill,
Jackson Lee warned the NRA, ``We're going to turn the lights out on
you. We can beat the gun lobby.''

   PRIZREN, Kosovo _ German NATO troops found a dead man and 15
other people badly beaten in a former Serbian Interior Ministry
police station and detained 25 members of the Kosovo Liberation
Army in the latest step by NATO peacekeepers Friday to reign in the
rebel army.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA guerillas, who were disarmed by the German troops, had
apparently imprisoned and severely beaten the elderly people,
mostly Gypsies, accusing them of looting the homes of ethnic
Albanians and cooperating with Serbian military or police forces.
</P>
<P>
   According to German NATO officers, troops found the dead elderly
man chained to a chair in what may have been a KLA torture chamber
for alleged collaborators with the Serbs during their attempts to
terrorize Albanians into fleeing the wars-torn province.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses saw the Germans take weapons away from scores of KLA
soldiers and eventually carry the stiff body of the elderly man
into a military truck. German troops piled up a small collection of
about four rifles, 30 clips for automatic weapons, a bag of shotgun
shells and 10 hand grenades outside the police station -- actually
just a smattering of armaments in a region where nearly every man
owns weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything went without problems,'' German Sgt. Maj. Johann
Fritsch said. ``The situation was tense, but the handing over of
weapons was not.''
</P>
<P>
   But the discovery, which came four days after the separatist
rebels returned triumphantly to Prizren, a city in southern Kosovo,
following the withdrawal of Yugoslav force and Serb police and
paramilitary gangs serves as a reminder of the KLA's reputation for
brutality -- something frequently overlooked in recent months as
the group became a convenient ally of NATO in its 78-day air war
against Serb-led Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have long considered the rebel group to be
undisciplined and violent, and at one point claimed it was a
terrorist organization -- a claim echoed by the Yugoslav government
in defense of its brutal actions against Kosovo's ethnic Albanian
majority. That ended around the time the group became a significant
political and military threat to Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic,
president of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   While the gruesome discovery shows the difficulties NATO may
face in transforming the KLA from a war-hardened guerrilla group to
a modern, democratic political organization that respects human
rights, German commanders did reach an agreement Friday with the
KLA that its soldiers could not walk openly with weapons anywhere
in the southwestern sector of Kosovo overseen by German troops.
</P>
<P>
   KLA fighters are commonly seen on the streets of Prizren,
Kosovo's second largest city, with rifles and hand grenades. They
were supposed to stop carrying weapons at midnight (local time)
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   German troops had insisted previously that they had no legal
authority to disarm KLA soldiers unless they interfered with Kosovo
Force, or KFOR, peacekeeping troops. KLA leaders have insisted that
their weapons were needed to protect ethnic Albanians while some
Serbs remained in the region and threatened to commit acts of
terror.
</P>
<P>
   However, the relative quiet in Prizren the last couple of days
seemed to clear the way for the agreement. U.S. troops began
disarming the KLA in their sector of Kosovo on Thursday while in
Pec, a northern city where Serbs are still active, Italian troops
have yet to disarm the KLA -- which taken control in scattered
areas of the province as Serb troops have withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   As further evidence of KLA cooperation Friday, the rebels agreed
to turn over to the American NATO troops five Serb kidnap victims
whom KLA activists had seized inside Kosovo this week for allegedly
burning Albanian villages and killing Kosovar Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need to keep them,'' said KLA brigade commander Agron
Hoxha in an interview at his hilltop headquarters here in
southeastern Kosovo. ``We are interested in giving NATO these war
criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoxha said the five Serbs would be released Saturday morning in
reasonably good health, even though he acknowledged they ``have
been beaten up a little bit'' by the KLA irregular forces he said
had captured the five men for interrogation.
</P>
<P>
   At least 27 Serbs, many from prominent families, were kidnapped
within two days in the American occupation zone of Kosovo by armed
gunmen claiming to represent the KLA during an orgy of retribution
before American peacekeepers had taken firm control.
</P>
<P>
   If the promised release occurs, it will mean that about 25 of
about 27 Serb kidnap victims have been released. At least two
others are still thought to be missing.

   PRIZREN, Yugoslavia _ The Kosovo Liberation Army is setting up
interim governments in a number of cities, moving rapidly to fill
the civic vacuum. In at least one case of exerting their
self-appointed authority, the rebels arrested and beat several
prisoners, apparently so severely that one of them died Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The ex-guerrillas are moving into city halls and makeshift
municipal buildings, with their own black-uniformed police at the
doors, trying to get electricity, water and other basic services
working. Their major problem, several of the newly minted civil
officials said, is that there is virtually no food and tens of
thousands more refugees are on the way.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations, under the terms of the agreement signed with
the Serbs, is supposed to set up a civil authority, but has not
done so. The KLA is acting without any legal mandate, but NATO
commanders appear to have allowed the KLA to deal with several
local matters.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement calls for the KLA to be demilitarized by NATO
forces, but that has been enforced more strictly in some sectors
than in others. As the KLA flexes its muscles among a population
that still includes many frightened or hostile Serbs, its swift
assumption of power has brought it into conflict with NATO in some
cases, most notably in the German and American sectors.
</P>
<P>
   The tenuous and volatile nature of NATO's balancing act _
allowing the KLA to operate where it is convenient and trying to
rein them in where it is not _ was illustrated here Friday
afternoon when German troops swooped down on a former Serb special
police headquarters taken over by the KLA, briefly held 25 of the
guerrillas' military police and seized a pile of weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the police station, the German troops found 15 prisoners
held by the KLA, including an elderly man who was found dead,
handcuffed to a chair and badly beaten, according to a German
military spokesman, Lt. Col. Dietmar Jeserich. The prisoners were a
mixture of Serbs, Albanians and Gypsies, and it was not clear why
they had been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   One man had red welts across his back as if he had been lashed,
an old man had a bandage on his head and cuts on his face where he
had been beaten and another man said he had been stabbed in the
leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not even your worst enemy could do such a thing,'' said
Jankovic Janko, an elderly Serb who was beaten on the head. He said
he was seized outside his house on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The German troops confiscated weapons from stunned KLA soldiers
in passing cars and announced that no more weapons would be allowed
on the streets here after midnight.
</P>
<P>
   Col. Rolf Bescht, the German commander, said the NATO troops
were taking over the police station ``to make it perfectly clear we
are the only force, the only authority in town, not the KLA.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, relations between the NATO peacekeepers and the KLA
have for the most part been cordial, with the guerrillas regarding
the peacekeepers as allies who forced out the Serbs, and NATO
commanders _ whose own troops and tanks are only now spreading out
any distance from their bases _ tolerating the KLA guardposts along
the roads. The major tension has been in the American-controlled
sector where marines and paratroopers have aggressively disarmed
KLA patrols.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The good feeling is symbolized by posters bearing the rebel's
double-headed Albanian eagle and their Albanian initials UCK along
with those of NATO, posted all over the city of Djakovica. But all
that could change rapidly if there are clashes over disarming.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, the KLA is the only coherent Albanian force on the
ground at the moment, the only group with an organizational
structure and, now, a mass base of support developed during the
Serb campaign of terror. But the KLA has been united solely by its
resistance to the Serbs. Any other ideology is murky, and the group
is believed to contain a number of factions.
</P>
<P>
   When Slobodan Milosevic ignited passionate Serb nationalism in
Kosovo a decade ago as his means to political power, he fired all
Albanians from management positions, the police force and any other
post of authority. Albanians responded with their own ``parallel
society,'' running, for example schools and widely attended
elections in their homes. But, despite the approval of Western
leaders _ mainly because they didn't cause trouble _ their
nonviolence brought few gains, and its advocate Ibrahim Rugova, is
widely discredited.
</P>
<P>
   The new mayor here, Masar Shala, was the KLA's information
director across the Albanian border in Kukes last week. Up the road
in Djakovica, the district prefect, Mazllom Kumnova, is another KLA
member, a former political prisoner and longtime opposition
activist.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing is to form a government administration,''
Kumnova said. ``With the end of the war, the KLA will form also the
civil government. We will every day have more and more problems.
This government will be until we have elections.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   He said he had arrived two days ago, chosen by the military
command, from a KLA headquarters in the village of Mazreka. It was
difficult to work, he said, because people kept coming in to ask
about the more than 1,000 missing men believed to have been taken
from the city by the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course we don't have laws, we don't have written norms,''
he said, but we have enthusiasm for building a new state.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations has said that it intends to establish a civil
administration, but details of how it plans to do so are vague.
</P>
<P>
   ``I notice that the U.N. is going to do this organization of the
administration but they are late,'' Kumnova said. ``We couldn't
leave a vacuum without a government. Our purpose is that the
Albanians should be ready when the administration of the UN comes
to offer our project for a civil government. We are in the process
of assessing our needs.''
</P>
<P>
   United Nations and German officers worked closely with the KLA
in bringing the refugees across the border. KLA troops, first in
uniform and then, after some discussion, in civilian clothes,
helped register the refugees and screen out aspiring Albanian
looters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The KLA has been extremely constructive at the border,'' said
a high ranking U.N. official. ``They have made themselves a very
significant force inside the country.''
</P>
<P>
   But for some NATO officials the immediate problem was not civil
authority, but the guns being carried on the streets by the KLA.
</P>
<P>
   At a NATO briefing Friday morning, a German troop commander
announced that an agreement had been reached with the regional KLA
chief, known as Commander Drini, that no guns would be carried in
town after midnight and that military apparel would soon be shed.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ``With the agreement with the KLA, we now have the green light
to disarm anyone who goes around armed in the city. After two
further days, we will also have a ban on appearing in KLA uniform
in the city,'' Bescht said.
</P>
<P>
   Bescht also said the German troops had taken over the police
station to reinforce NATO authority. Germans had given the KLA
until noon to leave the station. But shortly after that, a German
patrol led by Maj. Dietrich Jensch saw that the guerrillas were
still there. The police station was soon surrounded by German
troops. The prisoners held by the KLA were released and several
treated by German medics.
</P>
<P>
   The 25 KLA military police who had been inside the police
station were gathered in one corner, under the guns of the German
troops, looking discomfitted at this turn of events. Their weapons,
mostly Kalashnikov assault rifles and extra clips of ammunition,
were piled up near the steps. Eventually, after much discussion,
the KLA troops were marched off by one of their commanders to their
own base.
</P>
<P>
   Commander Drini, who rushed to the scene to negotiate with the
German officers, said the prisoners were ``criminals.'' Several
people in the crowd of onlookers said there were two people who
were believed to be Albanians who had been informers for the Serbs.
A youth, Gzim Raduni, 16, said he recognized a Gypsy whom he had
told the KLA had stolen plates and silverware from his home.

NATO DISTRAUGHT AS KOSOVO SERBS, WARY OF KLA, FLEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By IAN FISHER    c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORAHOVAC, Yugoslavia _ A few days ago, the Serbs here made a
brave and unusual decision: They would stay in this Kosovo hillside
town, nearly 4,000 of them, and try to live again beside Albanians,
even as their fellow Serbs fled the province in the tens of
thousands.
</P>
<P>
   That all broke down Friday, and with it one small pocket of hope
for re-creating a multi-ethnic Kosovo. Friday afternoon, heavily
armed young German soldiers were reduced to escorting scared
Serbian women to their homes so they could pick up a few things and
leave town, probably forever. One woman walked down the street
grasping a soldier's hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's war,'' said Andelka Jovicic, a 42-year-old Serb, as she
dropped some old photos and a white shoe into her suitcase in the
apartment where she has lived for 20 years. ``I'm afraid.''
</P>
<P>
   For the previous few days, NATO officials had been advertising
Orahovac as a bright spot in the Kosovo devastation _ and they have
worked hard to persuade the Serbs to stay. Friday, officers took
that message house to house in the Serbian quarter, which is
crowded with the cars of Serbs who had lived around the town and
are now waiting to leave Kosovo for other parts of Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Even Sergio Vieira de Mello, the United Nations envoy to Kosovo,
was here Friday talking to the mayor, who is a Serb. Asked if he
was having any success in reassuring him, Vieira de Mello said, ``I
don't seem to.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs' reasons for leaving town are particularly disturbing
to NATO, because they seem closely linked to the peacekeeping
mission.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs here allege that guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army
kidnapped seven men Wednesday and Thursday as they went house to
house confiscating weapons. And as the guerrilla force only came
out of hiding since the arrival of the peacekeepers Sunday, the
Serbs here say they believe that the peacekeepers are cooperating
with the former rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we live here?'' asked Ljubisa Vitosevic, 25, who said
his 61-year-old father, Marko, was kidnapped two days ago. ``You
can see after only two days what's happening here. Nobody can
guarantee us anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Bogoljub Kujunojic, 57, a food inspector, said: ``We would all
stay here. But we've lost the trust. I don't know what to expect
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   From the start, the Serbs have eyed the peacekeepers, under NATO
command, with distrust for a reason that is hard to overcome: It
was NATO, after all, that bombed the Serbs for more than two
months, with some degree of cooperation with KLA forces on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   But since the peacekeepers arrived, that distrust has only
deepened as the KLA has tried to step in to become the new civil
and administrative force in Kosovo. NATO insists that it is the
only real power in Kosovo and that it is completely even-handed
with Serbs and Albanians alike.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here to try to tell the Serbs that they are safe
here,'' said Captain Peter Egger, who commands the unit of 120
German peacekeepers here. ``We have checkpoints in and out of town.
We control the KLA. Nobody has to be anxious.''
</P>
<P>
   The reality, though, is that the KLA has felt free to demand
weapons from local people _ even as they themselves are supposed to
disarm under the terms of the peace agreement _ and they have taken
over the police station here as their new headquarters. But they
strongly deny having kidnapped anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs lie to you,'' said Skender Hoxha, the local KLA
commander. ``It's Serb propaganda.''
</P>
<P>
   What is happening in Orahovac seems only to give credence to the
view that too much happened in Kosovo over the last year _ too many
Albanians dead and displaced _ for Serbs and Albanians to live
together any time soon. Mayor Andelk Kovosinac, 49, said he hoped
that would not have been the case here, where some 7 percent of the
population is Serb.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that more Albanians were killed than Serbs'' in the
conflict, Kovosinac said.
</P>
<P>
   But, he said, ``We're always lived together. We all want to stay
here.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that in the streets, in casual chats between neighbors,
Serbs decided several days ago that they would try to make it work:
At a meeting several days ago, he said, the peacekeepers, local
Albanians and the KLA, all assured him that the Serbs should stay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone said it was going to be OK,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But then the kidnappings were reported, mostly of older men, and
Serbs from around town moved up the hill in fear into the Serb
quarter. Top Serb officials in Belgrade have tried to convince the
Serbs here to leave.
</P>
<P>
   And as word spread among Albanians that the Serbs were going to
leave,_ any early optimism among the Serbs has disintegrated. A
Serb civilian with a machine gun, threatening to kill KLA soldiers,
had to be prevented by friends from going down into the main
square.
</P>
<P>
   In the square, Albanian men kept watch in the town center to
halt the convoy of Serbs: One reason is that Albanians claim that
many of the cars and trucks that the Serbs have were stolen from
them. Albanian refugees also want about 40 men arrested who they
say committed atrocities over the last few months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we also want to live with them,'' said Qant Sharku, 33, a
driver and construction worker. ``But only the Serbs that aren't
dirty.'' But when asked how many of them participated in the war,
he answered, ``Almost all.''
</P>
<P>
   Ali Kabashi, 62, called his nephews, Sakip, 13, and Sahit, 14,
out of a crowd here. He said the boys had survived an attack from a
grenade, which he said was thrown into a basement full of 30 people
in a nearby town by a local Serb policeman. Five people died,
including the boys' mother, grandmother and two sisters, one of
whom was only six months old.
</P>
<P>
   Kabashi first said that he thought some Serbs should stay, that
it was possible for Orahovac to return to something resembling what
it was like before. But then he changed his mind: In truth, he said
he could never again live next to a Serb family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't,'' he said. ``They killed a six-month-old baby. They
all should go. How can they stay?''

   ``If I were asked what book is better than a cheap book, I
should answer that there is one book better than a cheap book, and
that is a book honestly come by.'' James Russell Lowell, poet and
editor (first editor of The Atlantic Monthly), testifying before
the United States Senate Committee on Patents on Jan. 29, 1886.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for many bookstore owners, that is not a sentiment
shared by all of the people who visit their stores.
</P>
<P>
   If the preferences of the book-buying public show up in the form
of a best-seller list, then what of the picks of the book-stealing
public? Arts &AMP; Ideas decided to sample the taste of homegrown book
thieves in an extremely unscientific survey.
</P>
<P>
   Many bookstore owners were reluctant even to acknowledge theft.
(The super bookstore chains like Barnes &AMP; Noble and Borders
declined to make any comment at all.) But among the shops that did
respond, their thieves had remarkably similar tastes. Whether the
West Coast or the East, the Beat poets Jack Kerouac, Charles
Bukowski, Allen Ginsberg and William Burroughs kept popping up as
favorites among shoplifters. (In Britain, The Economist surveyed
booksellers and similarly found that the Beat poet Jack Kerouac had
the No. 1 slot.) Tight behind the Beats, comes the Bible.
</P>
<P>
   At Ventura Bookstore in Ventura, Ca., Kerouac's ``On the Road''
and Ginsberg's ``Howl!'' are at the top of the most-wanted lists as
well as that old favorite, Abbie Hoffman's ``Steal This Book,''
said Ed Elrod, the owner. Tarot cards and how-to books,
particularly sex manuals, are also popular. Even Bibles get taken,
which Elrod says he thinks are used for marriage ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Berman, manager of the historic City Lights bookstore in
North Beach in San Francisco, said that Kerouac, Burroughs and
Ginsberg are the most popular writers to take. It may be a younger
generation of thieves interested in Douglas Coupland's Generation X
books as well.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Millemann, a general manager of the Tattered Cover in
Denver, one of the largest stores in the country at 40,000 square
feet, said the Beat poets rank high in the stolen category, along
with textbooks and art and photography books.
</P>
<P>
   Kerouac is also a favorite at both Shakespeare and Co.'s stores
on the Upper East Side and in lower Broadway in Manhattan. Linda
Marotta, senior buyer at the downtown store, says that Burroughs
and Bukowski are also popular steals. Nick Marino, general manager
of the uptown store, said that Dover Classics books, which sell for
$1 or $2, are also popular. He says he believes that art and travel
books that can be sold on the street are stolen by professionals.
</P>
<P>
   At Powell's Book Store, in Portland, Ore., one of the largest
chain stores, the general manager, Miriam Sontz, said people who
take books fall into two categories: those who steal on impulse and
those who take books to sell for money. She said that people take
books they would be ashamed to buy: books on cocaine cultivation,
sex dysfunction or ``racy'' books for teen-agers. Bibles are also a
favorite, she added, saying she does not know why.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Watkins, vice president and general manager of Vroman's
Bookstore, which has been in Pasadena, Calif., for 105 years, said
that drug dealers and the homeless steal salable books. She said
she believed that these thieves were given lists by used-book
stores specifying which titles were in demand. Art books, first
editions and hard-cover mysteries are hard to keep on the shelves,
she added.
</P>
<P>
   The Strand Book Store in Manhattan seems to attract a more
intellectual crowd. Although electronic detectors installed five
years ago significantly cut down on theft, the owner, Fred Bass,
said that before the heightened security, Greek and Latin classics,
books on higher mathemathics, philosophy, Judaica as well as other
scholarly and religious books were targets. These days, he said,
art books are taken by professional thieves.
</P>
<P>
   At Green Apple Books and Music in San Francisco, the general
manager, Pete Mulvihill, reports that current favorites for
shoplifters include Bibles and books on philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Across the bay, in Berkeley, Patrick Marks, buyer for Cody's
Books, said that before the security system was updated, works by
Toni Morrison and Bukowski would be stolen. Now the more persistent
thieves are more interested in monster books, language audio tapes,
Tarot cards and coins that come in game books.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuscaloosa, Ala., the Book Cellar's manager, Edna Thomas,
said that stealing was not a major problem, although occasionally
rock-and-roll and computer-game magazines were taken.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, theft does not seem to be much of a problem in
Martha's Vineyard, the small affluent resort. Dana Anderson, an
owner of Bickerton &AMP; Ripley in Edgartown, Mass., said that books on
summer reading lists were stolen occasionally as were small gift
books but that nothing major had been shoplifted. Alex Comfort's
``Joy of Sex'' used to be a favorite of thieves, she said, so the
store stopped stocking it.
</P>
<P>
   In Wareham, Mass., on the road to Cape Cod, Steve Bunshaft,
owner of Ken-Mark Books, said there was no problem with stealing.
His real worry? Competition from large chain bookstores in four
nearby malls.

SURF'S (NOT) UP! SEAWEED INUNDATES TEXAS BEACHES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KEVIN MORAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GALVESTON, Texas _ The crowds of beachgoers flocking to the
Texas coast this summer are encountering another feature along with
sand, surf and sun.
</P>
<P>
   Seaweed.
</P>
<P>
   Heaps of it. Broad, thick layers of it that bathers in some
areas even have to wade through to get to the water.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons that even the experts haven't determined, an
unusually large influx of the brown, stringy algae has inundated
many of the state's coastal areas in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The onslaught of clingy, floating seaweed is the worst since
1989, when huge sheets of the stuff, pushed by Gulf of Mexico
currents, clogged Texas barrier island beaches for more than two
months.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists who study seaweed and other marine life know no more
now than they did a decade ago about why the floating plants come
in huge quantities some years and in small amounts other years,
Texas A&AMP;M University-Galveston marine biologist Dr. Bill Wardle
said this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, there's no one that I know of that's really
taking an active research interest in it,'' Wardle said. ``It only
becomes a problem every 10 years or so, so we're not that concerned
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   On Galveston Island recently, beach managers first attempted to
clear the seaweed away from the surf line every day so it wouldn't
interfere with tourists' enjoyment of the shore. But by early this
month, they decided to just pile the stuff along the surf line in
hopes that the resulting berm would keep newly arriving seaweed
from covering up all the sandy areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our cleaning crews have been working extended hours in a
consistent effort to clear the seaweed and debris from the beaches,
but haven't been able to make a real impact,'' said Lou Muller,
executive director of the Galveston Park Board of Trustees, when he
announced an end to the removal efforts. ``Once the seaweed stops
washing in, we can either add it to the dunes for natural beach
nourishment or clear it away.''
</P>
<P>
   People concerned about erosion along the coast maintain that the
seaweed helps hold precious sand on the beaches.
</P>
<P>
   At Mustang Island State Park near Port Aransas, managers have
let nature take its course since the seaweed began building up,
said park employee Mike Felts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a natural process,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the seaweed may be unpleasant for humans once it starts
decaying and smelling, there's an up side for shore creatures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seaweed has a number of species of critters that are
indigenous to it, such as crabs, shrimp, eels and fish,'' Felts
said. ``There are birds and other critters that feed on those.''
</P>
<P>
   The seaweed travels a couple thousand miles before it hits Texas
shores.
</P>
<P>
   It starts its journey in the Sargasso Sea, a calm part of the
mid-Atlantic Ocean defined by intercontinental currents. Those who
have sailed through the area report spectacular expanses of
seaweed, which shelters sea turtles and large fish that feed off
crabs, snails, shrimp and other organisms.
</P>
<P>
   As in 1989, Wardle said, the seaweed that has piled up on Texas
beaches comprises two species: ``natans'' and ``fluitans.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the world's 40-or-so species of seaweed _ sargassum is
the family name _ attach to rocks and stay put, he said. ``Natans''
and ``fluitans'' are two species that wander for some reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Natans'' has a narrower, more serrated leaf than ``fluitans.''
It also has rounded air bladders _ the countless, tiny, balloonlike
things that keep the algae afloat.
</P>
<P>
   Just why the seaweed came to Texas is anybody's guess, but most
scientists theorize that its arrival has to do with changes in
ocean currents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just circumstances of unusual current patterns that
happen to concentrate it more in the Gulf of Mexico than in other
places,'' Wardle said. ``It might also have something to do with
the availability of nutrients in the ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   Or it may be a combination of the two factors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While the seaweed is mainly considered a nuisance among
beachgoers and beach managers, Wardle said he may study the stuff
to see if it contains any of the medically or commercially
beneficial chemicals found in some other seaweed species.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, people seeking fun in the sun on Texas beaches will
have to struggle through piles of seaweed up to knee-high to take a
dip in the Gulf.

   PODUJEVO, Yugoslavia _ Yugoslav troops pulled out of northern
towns of Kosovo Friday, moving slightly ahead of schedule and
showing a readiness now to leave ahead of Sunday's deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav troops still manned posts along the roads, looking out
from the second-floor balconies of roadside houses, or sitting on
chairs by the entrances of buildings. Around them in the villages
along the road several houses were still burning, the smoke thick
and white under a light rain. They seemed to be Albanian houses,
evidently set on fire just a few hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The British 4th Armored Brigade moved into the town of Podujevo,
making a big show of force and stationing three gigantic guns on
the main street and half a dozen troop carriers beside the Serbian
police station. They were in place by 6 a.m. to watch columns of
Yugoslav tanks, troop trucks and armored cars leave.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time French troops moved in to Mitrovica to the
west, coordinating their entrance with the departing Yugoslav
forces. The northern part of Kosovo is the last area to see troops
go.
</P>
<P>
   Some 10,500 Serbian police and army are left in Kosovo now, and
have to leave by midnight Sunday. NATO spokesmen said the departure
is moving ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian refugees, meanwhile, are pouring into the province from
the south. Some 50,000 have now crossed over from Albania and
Macedonia into Kosovo in NATO's wake, a spokesman from the U.N.
high commissioner for refugees said Friday. More than 18,000 alone
crossed over on Wednesday, 13,000 of them from Kukes in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   A Yugoslav officer guarding the army base in Podujevo alongside
two British soldiers said the last troops would be gone from the
town by Saturday morning, well ahead of schedule, since Podujevo is
one of the last major towns in the north.
</P>
<P>
   The officer watched the ethnic Albanian residents of Podujevo
strolling on the streets for the first time in two months now that
NATO is in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's strange to see all these people, especially the young
ones,'' he said. ``We only saw old men and women coming out for
bread before.''
</P>
<P>
   As elsewhere, the local residents lined the streets and tossed
flowers to the arriving NATO troops. Many said they had fled the
town in March and lived in the hills for a month. They filtered
back down to their homes a month ago, since the conditions had been
so desperate and food so scarce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just stayed indoors all the time,'' said Imer Aliu, a
gray-haired man standing admiring the British AS-90 vehicle-mounted
guns. ``For the first time we will sleep soundly tonight.''

ANALYSIS: ISRAELIS HEAR TROUBLE IN BARAK'S SILENCE

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israelis abhor silence, and their prime
minister-elect, Ehud Barak, has been silent as a stone since his
overwhelming victory a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   In that time, Barak has conducted extensive negotiations with
political parties to form a coalition government. But he has made
few public declarations, given few interviews and refused to show
his hand through the news leaks that have long been tradition here.
</P>
<P>
   It has been an unusually protracted limbo between governments,
and anxious Israeli commentators first read trouble into the
vacuum. They decided that Barak, 57, a highly decorated former
general, was a political rookie who was undergoing an excruciating
hazing. They criticized his slowness to form a government, pressing
him, as did political associates, to be less obstinate, to soften
his demands, to hurry up and fill the void.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of this week, after the resignation of Aryeh Deri
as the leader of the ultra-Orthodox Shas party, public opinion had
turned around. Barak, many realized, was pursuing a strategy: With
complete deliberateness, he was choosing to set his course and then
wait for others to come around. He is not a man who blinks first.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our country of fleeting images,'' Chemi Shalev, a
columnist, wrote Friday in the newspaper Maariv, ``Barak changed
overnight from being a loser to a winner, from being an
inexperienced political apprentice to a real `wizard.' The truth
lies, as usual, somewhere in the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   The resignation of Deri, who was convicted of corruption this
spring, represented a breakthrough in the coalition negotiations.
Immediately afterward, Barak gave his first extensive interview
since his victory, published Friday in the newspaper Haaretz.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Barak said he would move quickly to
construct a $200 million, 29-mile elevated highway between
Palestinian territories in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, in the Haaretz interview and in recent private
conversations, Barak has made it clear that he considers himself to
be charting a new course, learning from the mistakes of his
predecessors. Better to build a government slowly than to make
alliances or promises he would live to regret, he has said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said it is better to make peace with the Palestinians
and the Syrians a priority _ if priorities must be chosen _ than to
turn first to solving internal divisions. The internal divisions,
however grave, will not literally blow up in Israel's face, he has
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Palestinians officials say his silence toward them has
been unnerving, Barak has said he is sending messages to Yasser
Arafat, the Palestinian leader. He has congratulated Arafat for
recent arrests of terror suspects, urged him to be patient and
proclaimed that they will not sit opposite each other but beside
each other at negotiating tables.
</P>
<P>
   On May 18, the day after he was elected by a wide margin, Barak
and his Labor Party faced a critical choice. He was determined to
form a broad coalition so that his parliamentary backing would
match the sweeping electoral mandate he believed he had received.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Party, remade into a coalition party called One
Israel, had received only 26 seats in the fractious 120-member
Parliament. So he felt he needed to turn to one of the other two
medium-sized parties: Shas, with 17 seats, or Labor's traditional
opponent, the defeated Likud Party of Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, with 19 seats.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, he was also choosing between internal peace and
external peace, both of which he had promised to pursue. With Shas,
which is moderate on external talks, he would be able to move
forward with the Palestinians and the Syrians. With Likud, he would
be able to move forward on his domestic program, including a
difficult agenda for the religious parties: drafting yeshiva boys
and writing a constitution that would institutionalize Israel as a
secular, democratic state.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations with the acting head of Likud, Ariel Sharon, the
departing foreign minister, broke down when Sharon demanded too
much personal power and right-wing ideological control of the peace
effort.
</P>
<P>
   But Shas, which burgeoned during the elections into a major
political force, presented other problems, primarily Deri.
</P>
<P>
   Deri, who remains out of jail while he appeals his conviction,
had been pronounced an unacceptable partner by Barak and his
centrist and leftist allies. His resignation was considered a
precondition for his party's inclusion in the government, but
seemed difficult to imagine because he is a charismatic leader with
loyal backing.
</P>
<P>
   When he did step down, volunteering to leave town during the
talks so he would not be seen as manipulating behind the scenes,
political analysts here revised their thinking on Barak. They
decided that he plays a good waiting game. They pointed to the way
he also waited out Yitzhak Mordechai, the Center Party leader,
until he stepped down the day before Election Day, assuring Barak's
big victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The model that beat Deri was that same model, that same
determination, those same nerves of steel that Barak used while
waiting for Yitzhak Mordechai to withdraw,'' Sima Kadmon wrote this
week in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth. ``Barak believes that if
one is adamant about an issue of principle, if one does not falter
or begin to sweat, the other one will blink first.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak needs to negotiate terms with Shas, and renegotiate with
the other parties whose standing is altered by the inclusion of
Shas. If Barak succeeds in coming to terms with the parties still
at the table, he would end up with a 77-seat bloc, a clear
majority.
</P>
<P>
   It would include Shas, Meretz (the large, traditional left
party), the new Center Party, the Russian immigrant party of Natan
Sharansky, the settlers' party, the ultra-Orthodox United Torah
Judaism party and a small party of trade unionists.
</P>
<P>
   Left in the opposition would be 10 Arab party members and 6
members of the aggressively secularist Shinui party _ which refuses
to sit in a government with Shas, but would probably support Barak
on peace deals and otherwise help keep him in power.
</P>
<P>
   But issues remain to be resolved so Barak does not end up with a
platform so broad that it ties his hands. Israeli law gives him
until July 8 to form a government.
</P>
<P>
   The religious parties are still looking for Barak to compromise
on his campaign pledge to draft the yeshiva boys, who are now
exempt from mandatory army service. The settlers want to secure a
commitment that he will not strip the settlements of their special
financial status. Sharansky's party is intent on holding on to two
ministries.
</P>
<P>
   Shas, having given up Deri, will seek to retain the Interior
Ministry, which Barak promised to take away from them.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Election Day, when Barak's supporters begged him
to close the door on Shas, chanting ``Just not Shas!'' at his
victory rally, a kind of rehabilitation of the party's image has
been under way.
</P>
<P>
   Barak himself has said that the party should be as much a
Sephardic-pride movement as a religious party, and that its
constituency _ Jews who come from the Middle East and North Africa
_ should not be tarred with the same brush as its corrupt leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``In contrast to my friends on the left, who view Shas as a lost
cause, I say that the court passed its verdict on one person,''
Barak told Haaretz. ``I suggest we not cast aspersions on a whole
movement.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In addition to exacting the removal of Deri, which was made
possible by the determination of Shas' spiritual leader, Rabbi
Ovadia Yosef, to join the new government, Barak is also certain to
demand newly transparent accounting practices. ``There will be an
end to the fictitious nonprofit associations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Having determined that waiting worked, it is possible that Barak
will try to sweat out the parties on all their remaining concerns
and stick to his guns.
</P>
<P>
   But he has made it clear that he is willing to defer decisions
on the draft and on the constitution so that he can put the
external peace effort first. He is determined, he has said, to keep
his eye on the bridge he wants to build, and not to be distracted
by the imperfections in individual stones.
</P>
<P>
   Barak seems intent on turning down the volume of the heated
discourse in this country, on introducing greater ``sobriety.''
</P>
<P>
   Very sure of himself, he seems determined to defy conventional
wisdom about what can and cannot be accomplished in Israel. He
wants to rise above the fray. Whether, as a political novice, he
has the ability to do so remains to be seen in what are likely to
be tumultuous months ahead.

IF WISHES WERE FATHER'S DAY GIFTS, THIS FATHER WOULD BE KING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BUZZ MCCLAIN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   My fourth Father's Day was rapidly approaching, and I found
myself conflicted.
</P>
<P>
   What, pray tell, did I want?
</P>
<P>
   My wife's favorite Mother's Day gift is an afternoon at the
Galleria _ without the kids. She thinks Mother's Day is
Independence Day, with a credit card.
</P>
<P>
   My own mother was the same way. Whenever we asked her what she
wanted on Her Day, she never failed to reply: ``A day of peace and
quiet.'' At the time, I couldn't understand why she would ask for
this _ the very thing we were entirely at a loss to accomplish (no
way was my father going to stay home alone with four wild
children). So every year we gave her stinky cheap perfume and a new
set of drinking glasses _ and every year she'd unwrap them and
smile and tell us it was exactly what she wanted.
</P>
<P>
   With two precocious children, ages 4 and 20 months, I was
beginning to understand the appeal of peace and quiet _ whatever
that might be _ but I just wasn't sure.
</P>
<P>
   With my wife pressing for some answers, I gave the day some
thought.
</P>
<P>
   First I thought of what I'd like. That seemed like the easy
part:
</P>
<P>
   Rangers tickets. For the family. So the Rangers are in Boston on
Father's Day, but they're at home Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday
in a crucial home stand against division rivals the Oakland
Athletics, and they're not back in Arlington again until July 2.
And to sweeten the deal, June 22 is Decker Dog Night, which means
the weenies will only be a buck. Failing to get to the game, one of
those Rangers red polo shirts would be acceptable (I wear XL).
</P>
<P>
   A DVD player. I know, I know _ they're expensive, but it IS
Father's Day. If the household budget can afford a splurge, there
are some very nice DVD players out there for about $400, although
Samsung makes one that goes for about $250 (however, you get what
you pay for in the way of digital component compatibility, sound
quality, etc.). And this isn't entirely selfish _ if we're not at
the Rangers game, the family can have movie time. Don't forget the
popcorn, please.
</P>
<P>
   A Weber gas grill. One big enough to land an aircraft on _ and
feed a family. One of the cliches we dads can't live down is that
we only cook when there's a roaring fire involved, so you may as
well oblige us and get us something that's safe. However, if a gas
grill threatens to bust the budget, one of those classic Weber
charcoal kettle types will be fine. And if that's too expensive,
how about a New York strip steak for dinner? Just think meat.
</P>
<P>
   Golf sandals. OK, this one is entirely selfish, but I could
never bring myself to fork over $70 at the pro shop for a pair of
these monsters. Golf sandals are just what they sound like, a pair
of fortified sandals with short, round studs just like golf shoes.
They are ideal for days when the temps climb into the high 90s _
before breakfast _ but you don't dare cancel your tee time. (I wear
11 1/2.)
</P>
<P>
   A rusty lid for the ``honey-do'' jar. Should all of the above be
too expensive or logistically difficult (and never let it be said I
wanted anyone to go out of their way to get a gift for me, no way),
this would be a superb Father's Day gift. The ``honey-do'' jar is
chock-full right about now, what with the deck needing a coat of
sealant, the attic needing cleaning before the yard sale, and the
boat needing a coat of shellac (What, we don't have a boat? Well
put that on the gift list, too). It would be very nice if for just
one Sunday that jar could stay sealed.
</P>
<P>
   A pneumatic paint sprayer. Should the ``honey-do'' jar be pried
open, it would be wonderful to have one of these motorized
contraptions in the garage to make life a little easier. Please?
</P>
<P>
   But as I made my list and checked it twice, pleased with the
choices that I knew Dads Everywhere would like, too, I began to
realize that Father's Day bliss, for me, meant more than just
getting.
</P>
<P>
   It meant not getting, too.
</P>
<P>
   So, here's what I don't want:
</P>
<P>
   I do not want a ``Teflon necktie'' from J.C. Penney. The Teflon
necktie, which is supposed to repel food stains, is insulting _
it's a glorified bib, for crying out loud. At least save it for my
``golden years.''
</P>
<P>
   I also don't want a videotape of a John Wayne film. Some
big-name video retailers think giving Dad a macho movie is the
perfect way to say, ``Love ya, dad, and thanks for being a man.'' I
think it's silly.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I don't want a day without my kids. Because without
them, I decided at last, I wouldn't even have this special day.
Peace and quiet are overrated. And I miss my kids enough as it is.
</P>

LITTLE LEADERSHIP, BUT PLENTY OF GAMESMANSHIP, BEHIND DEFEAT OF GUN
BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For all the national horror at the carnage in
Littleton, Colo., the sentiment over the school shooting could not
keep gun control legislation from collapsing on the House floor.
All that was left Friday afternoon was a cloud of dust and a bitter
political debate over who killed gun control.
</P>
<P>
   The confounding outcome was the result of a number of factors,
including the narrow majority of House Republicans, the sway of
conservatives over the Republican caucus, the determination of
Democrats to win back the House in 2000 and the differing views in
both parties over how the gun issue will play on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Only an extremely strong leader might have been able to navigate
such cross-currents. But Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois was
little seen, having said he would let members do as they wished. He
even left it up to Rep. Tom DeLay, the majority whip, and Rep. J.C.
Watts, the fourth-ranking leader, to try to explain to reporters
what happened on Friday. (They blamed the Democrats.)
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the passage of something as emotional as gun
control would have taken some goodwill between the parties on
Capitol Hill. But that disappeared long ago, in the days of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   As charges and countercharges flew, Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, the
widow who came to Congress after her husband was killed by a gunman
on the Long Island Rail Road, said, ``This is not a game to me.''
Near tears on the House floor at 1 a.m., the New York Democrat
said, ``This is not a game to the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   But political games were indeed being played by all sides.
</P>
<P>
   The groundwork for Friday's outcome was laid when Hastert spoke
out for some small steps for gun control in the wake of the
Senate's surprise passage of its own modest gun control measures.
He described it only as his personal opinion. But his remarks left
it clear that House Republicans wanted to avoid looking as deaf and
defensive as Senate Republicans did when they considered gun
control last month.
</P>
<P>
   So House Republican leaders then tried to assemble a gun control
bill that conservatives could embrace.
</P>
<P>
   Working with Rep. John D. Dingell, a Democrat from Michigan who
is an avid supporter of gun rights, they crafted a proposal to
regulate gun shows that was blessed by the National Rifle
Association. It was not only the most lenient of several competing
gun show provisions to come to the House floor for consideration,
it arguably weakened current gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Dingell amendment passed with the support of most
Republicans, including some conservatives who normally vote against
gun control measures. And it drew the allegiance of 45 conservative
Democrats, primarily from southern and western districts who
reflect their constituents' embrace of gun rights.
</P>
<P>
   But the passage of Dingell's measure and the subsequent defeat
of a more stringent one sponsored by Mrs. McCarthy left many
Democrats determined to oppose the final bill, rather than allow
the Republicans to say they had made a modest step on gun control.
``Morally I cannot vote for it, because it does set us back,'' said
Mrs. McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans gave Democrats some reasons to vote for the
bill, and a few more reasons to oppose it.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved an amendment requiring safety locks to be
sold with handguns and another banning the import of high-capacity
ammunition clips. But it also weakened District of Columbia gun
laws by voting to allow residents with no criminal history to
possess loaded handguns in their homes. And at the very last moment
Republicans blocked any House vote at all on a measure that would
have raised the minimum age for all handgun purchases from 18 to
21.
</P>
<P>
   In response, all but 10 Democrats opposed the bill en masse _
choosing to have a campaign issue against the Republicans rather
than a very modest gun control measure. The package was defeated
280 to 147.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton himself immediately began the Democratic
campaign refrain saying, ``This week, instead of listening to the
American people and strengthening our gun laws, the House of
Representatives listened to the gun lobby and did nothing at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic rebellion meant that in order to pass the
legislation virtually all Republicans would have to vote for it.
Hastert had originally called gun control a ``vote of conscience''
and said Republicans would let members do as they wished. While he
stood back DeLay rallied conservatives to support Dingell's measure
but left it ambiguous whether he would vote for the final bill. (He
did.)
</P>
<P>
   Then just a few hours before the vote Friday, Republican leaders
met and Hastert called for an all-out effort to pass the bill,
Republicans said. Hastert even appeared personally Friday before
Republican moderates to seek their vote.
</P>
<P>
   But 82 Republicans broke with their party to vote against the
bill. Some were moderates like Rep. Marge Roukema of New Jersey,
who had co-sponsored Mrs. McCarthy's measure, and Rep. Tom Campbell
of California, who tried to help Democrats by bringing to the floor
speaker after speaker whom he introduced as a ``reasonable
Republican for reasonable gun control.''
</P>
<P>
   Also voting against the bill were a number of southern and
midwestern conservatives who are proud supporters of the Second
Amendment's right to bear arms and were opposed to any gun control
at all, despite the Republican effort to bring them onto the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we did was ultimately craft a bill that nobody was
pleased with,'' said Rep. Bob Riley, an Alabama Republican who
voted against the measure because he thought it contained too much
gun regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans, however, focused on the Democrats in
explaining the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is quite obvious to me that they are just interested in
politics,'' DeLay said, ``not interested in even getting what they
could get with the votes that were available to be had by the
House.''

NOT FOR THE FAINT-HEARTED  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 20) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Does buying shares in a new community bank in your town make
investing sense?
</P>
<P>
   The main attraction is the chance to acquire, at close to book
value and with no fees, a security that subsequently may sell for a
modest multiple of book value.
</P>
<P>
   Of the six new banks that opened their doors in 1997 in New
Jersey, one, Community Bank of New Jersey in Freehold, has run
ahead of the pack. The bank has pumped up its assets, to $94
million last month from $13 million two years ago, and deposits are
growing by $5 million a month. It now trades at 1.7 times book
value.
</P>
<P>
   (The average publicly traded bank that opened in 1997 now trades
at 1.3 times book value; older small- and mid-cap banks trade at
1.9 times book value, according to Ryan, Beck &AMP; Co., a broker and
underwriter based in Livingston, N.J.)
</P>
<P>
   Community Bank of New Jersey is the clear leader in its class
because it is already generating profits, said Cassandra Toroian,
an analyst for Ryan, Beck who follows the stock but has no rating
on it. ``It's usually a couple of years before they break even,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   But like all small-bank stocks, it should be viewed as a thinly
traded, and therefore illiquid, microcap. Many start-up banks have
no ready market for their shares. Some, like Village Bank, arrange
for a broker to be a market maker.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Hughes, a money manager in Hunter, N.Y., who invests in
bank stocks, thinks that start-ups are a waste of time when bigger,
better-capitalized bank stocks are available at a better value. ``I
could name 50 I'd rather be in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors buy small-bank stocks hoping for a premium in the
event of a takeover. But while there are several recent examples of
big banks' buying small ones and paying an average of three times
book value for them, Ms. Torian said it was not a good idea to
count on a buyout.

   A Happy Ending &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Was it a blow to crush the spirit of a budding entrepreneur?
Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   To earn enough to buy a pack of Pokemon trading cards, Aaron
Faughn, 9, with two friends, set up a stand in front of his
Hamilton, Ohio, home a week ago and sold lemonade and Kool-Aid for
a quarter a cup until two older kids robbed him of $6.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out to have been the best thing that could have
happened to young Aaron. Local news coverage brought sympathetic
customers flocking, along with invitations to sell his drinks at
neighborhood businesses. Gross receipts rocketed into the hundreds
of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Then the Kraft Foods unit of Philip Morris dispatched a
promotional aide dressed as a pitcher of Kool-Aid to present Aaron
with balloons and gifts, including a Nintendo game. (According to
The Cincinnati Enquirer, the sight of the guy in the pitcher suit
at first sent Aaron ducking behind the stand in fear.)
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, Butler County Sheriff's deputies tracked down and
arrested two teen-agers in connection with the theft. The deputies
got certificates from the Kool-Aid man, too.

   LONDON _ At first blush, the idea might seem stretched, even
silly. For $1,800, British executives can spend a weekend at the
Globe Theater being tutored in management skills through the prism
of Shakespeare's plays _ notably ``Henry V'' and ``Julius Caesar.''
</P>
<P>
   But then consider the plot of ``Henry V'': an ambitious leader
(Henry) covets a rival's assets (France) and makes an offer. The
offer is refused. But by marshaling his allies (earls), weeding out
the waverers and deploying true grit and new technology (the
longbow), Henry prevails.
</P>
<P>
   Shakespeare was dramatizing the Battle of Agincourt of 1415, but
to modern eyes his play is the story of a perfectly executed, very
hostile takeover.
</P>
<P>
   The exercise, a cooperative venture between the Cranfield
University School of Management and the Globe, is one of many
kindred projects in Britain introducing the performing arts into
the repertoire of management education.
</P>
<P>
   The concept is more familiar in the United States than it is
here. But Britain, with a rich cultural heritage on which to draw _
and many arts companies seeking new revenue sources _ is rushing to
embrace it.
</P>
<P>
   In April, for instance, the New York-based conductor Roger
Nierenberg came here to work with the London Philharmonic Orchestra
in presenting a program called the Music Paradigm. Executives from
companies including the Bank of Scotland, BP-Amoco, Nestle and
South African Airways sat among the musicians to glean an
understanding of how orchestral harmony might be translated to
their business organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Nierenberg is to return to England from New York next week to
record a further session for broadcast on BBC television in July;
executives from companies including Allied Domecq, British Airways,
Natwest and Barclays will sit in on Brahms' First Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   His aim is to let executives experience how the orchestra works
_ or doesn't. For instance, he said, he might ask the oboist to
tune down the wind and brass section by a quarter tone. When the
section plays together, it's fine. ``But when the entire orchestra
plays together, the orchestra as a whole is dysfunctional,'' he
said, a parallel to a corporation whose units are not in sync.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Nierenberg might conduct the orchestra in a manner
intended to evoke the tensions that often arise in a merger. ``Two
cultures haven't aligned around the goals, so I'll provoke
difference and then solve the differences,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to Nierenberg, the exercise allows executives to
perceive both the challenges they face and the potential solutions.
``It leaves a new way for them to talk about themselves,'' he said.
``It gives them a metaphor, a vocabulary.'' The cost: $20,000 to
$40,000 a session for a group of executives.
</P>
<P>
   In Stratford-on-Avon, meanwhile, the Royal Shakespeare
Company &UR;  &LR; has initiated a program called Directing Creativity _
usually a one-day event in which managers are coached by a
director, using theatrical techniques, in skills from voice
projection to problem-solving.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, said Kate Hunter, a spokeswoman for the company, is to
use the experience of creating a theatrical ensemble as a model for
teamwork in business.
</P>
<P>
   After a visit this month to the London Business School, the
company is scheduled to go to New Haven, where it will run a course
for managers from Dunkin' Donuts. (The doughnut chain's owner,
Allied Domecq, has an $8.8 million sponsorship deal with the Royal
Shakespeare.)
</P>
<P>
   In part, the rise of arts-based management courses reflects
educators' recognition that their techniques needed to be updated,
said Professor Martin Christopher, head of executive development
programs at Cranfield, which is north of London, in Bedford.
``After all these years, we have discovered that there are a
variety of ways in which we can improve skills, knowledge and
capabilities other than chalk-and-talk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, executives are looking for innovative ways to
enhance managers' performance. ``In the old days, people would come
on a course because it was a good thing to do,'' Christopher said.
``In these more hard-pressed times, the question is, `How can I do
my job better?'''
</P>
<P>
   Fiona Clark, 30, a development and training officer at the
Design Council, which is financed by the British government, said
she had found some answers to that question last September, at a
weekend ``Henry V'' session at the Globe.
</P>
<P>
   The play is regarded as a classic analysis of a young person
stepping into power and exercising it in the face of overwhelming
odds. At the siege of Harfleur, in Act III, for example, the young
King Harry exhorts his followers to again storm the ramparts of the
French port:
</P>
<P>
   (MORE) &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   (italics)I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,
</P>
<P>
   Straining upon the start. The game's afoot!
</P>
<P>
   Follow your spirit; and, upon this charge
</P>
<P>
   Cry `God for Harry, England and Saint George!'(end italics)
</P>
<P>
   ``What was interesting was that he talked about higher
purpose,'' Ms. Clark said, noting that the King doesn't simply
exhort his soldiers to beat up the French. ``He talks about England
and God,'' she continued. ``That's how he rallied his troops.''
</P>
<P>
   The point is driven home by Richard Olivier, who runs the
Globe's management seminars. (And yes, if the name seems familiar,
he is the son of the late Lord Olivier, who played Henry V on stage
and screen.) ``The use of language to make the future real _ that,
to me, is one of the key skills of leadership,'' Olivier said.
``It's not enough to put an action plan down on paper or in an
e-mail. You actually have to talk to people, enthuse them with your
passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Clark took the lesson home with her. ``The challenge is to
make it personal to the individual,'' she said. ``What you want is
to inspire people to think what the basic goal means to them.''
</P>
<P>
   But the play is not only about being persuasive. Well before the
battle, the king has three noblemen executed in short order for
treason. There's a corporate lesson in that, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you truly believe in what you are doing,'' Ms. Clark said,
``then once you have made that decision, you can't waiver.''
</P>
<P>
   Sending people on training courses is, of course, slightly
different from sending traitors to their deaths. But the parallel
lies in the exercise of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the links I made early on is that Shakespeare, more
than any other playwright, deals with people in a position of
power,'' Olivier said. ``There are always kings, dukes, princes who
are put in some kind of dilemma about how to deal with authority,
whether it is being threatened by someone or where power has to be
negotiated.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all Shakespeare's plays end as well as ``Henry V'' ends for
King Harry. But there are business applications in the body-strewn
denouements of tragedies like ``Macbeth'' as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can learn about what not to do,'' Olivier said darkly.
``When people become too focused on one particular goal or outcome,
then tragedy is not far behind.''

   Graef Crystal has spent years opining about the excesses in
executive pay. He has taken on corporate chieftains like Sanford I.
Weill of Citigroup, Charles B. Wang of Computer Associates and
Linda Wachner of Warnaco for their fat compensation packages.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly two decades as a compensation consultant with
Towers Perrin, he now edits an Internet newsletter,
Crystalreport.com, which regularly pillories chief executives that
he contends are grossly overpaid.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal, who has studied the relationship between pay and
performance, does not believe that executive pay, in and of itself,
has much influence on a company's success.
</P>
<P>
   Pay ``doesn't really motivate the CEO,'' he said, adding, ``They
are already working as hard as they can; they are already working
as smart as they can.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he did wonder if investors could improve their returns by
avoiding companies that overpaid their chief executives. By last
summer, he had selected 60 companies whose pay packages he thought
included overly high salaries, undeserved bonuses or inordinately
large stock option grants.
</P>
<P>
   He dropped two companies from his list after they ousted their
chief executives; he then tracked the stock performance of the
rest.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal found that those 58 companies, on average, significantly
underperformed both the overall market and other companies in their
respective industries. They lost, on average, 1.5 percent for the
12 months through May 28, compared with a 12.2 percent gain for the
average of companies in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index, regardless
of market capitalization. Roughly two-thirds of the stocks dropped
in price.
</P>
<P>
   A year, of course, is not enough time to form a definite
conclusion about the relationship between high pay and poor
performance, but Crystal thinks he may be onto something. While
paying a chief executive too much may not have a direct impact on a
company's performance, he thinks that it could signal a lack of
concern for investors on the part of corporations and their chief
executives.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Crystal said, those executives may lack the
discipline to cut costs, including other executives' salaries.
</P>
<P>
   In determining whether a chief executive was being overpaid,
Crystal looked at the size and stock market performance of the
company. He also took into account factors like profitability.
</P>
<P>
   Golden Books Family Entertainment, for example, was chosen
because of its 1997 employment agreement with Richard E. Snyder,
its chairman and chief executive. Although the publisher's stock
had lagged behind the overall market and the company was losing
money, the new agreement about doubled Snyder's base salary, to
$950,000; awarded him a special bonus of $500,000, and offered him
the possibility of earning an additional $6.1 million if the stock
reached a certain target, Crystal said. (The stock lost 95.8
percent of its value over the 12 months ended May 28.)
</P>
<P>
   At Sequent Computer Systems, Crystal noticed the chief
executive's history of high pay and some details of his dealings
with the company. Sequent's stock had done poorly over the last
decade, and Karl C. Powell Jr., the company's chief executive, had
participated in three different repricings of stock options. He
also received $600,000 a year for leasing his corporate jet to the
company, and his daughter received a salary of $65,000 to drive a
race car in competitions that the company said helped promote
Sequent's products. (Its stock fell 21.2 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   A Sequent spokesman said Powell's daughter technically was not
paid by the company but by the racing team, which in turn is paid
by Sequent.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies made Crystal's group for different reasons. At
Conseco, Stephen Hilbert received a cash bonus of $15 million in
1997 _ in addition to stock options and restricted stock. At
Cendant, Henry Silverman owned no actual shares in his company,
although he was awarded numerous options to buy shares.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the companies defended their pay practices, saying the
chief executive is responsible for key strategic decisions that
have a long-term impact.
</P>
<P>
   There were exceptions to the overall record of losing stock
prices. Consider Amgen Inc. Although Crystal selected Amgen because
it effectively gave its chief executive, Gordon M. Binder, a raise
by awarding him roughly three times the number of stock options he
was given the year before, even after it cut his bonus, the stock
more than doubled.
</P>
<P>
   Crystal cautions against relying too heavily on executive pay
when deciding to buy or sell a stock. But he does believe that
investors should take pay into account. At the very least, he said,
large investors could use this information to lobby for change, as
they do about other matters of concern to shareholders.

BUSINESS SUITS AGAINST GOVERNMENT FOCUS ATTENTION ON NAFTA CLAUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Wash., Ohio, Miss., British Columbia)   (bl)  
 By TIMOTHY PRITCHARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ A $970 million lawsuit against the U.S. government by
a Canadian fuel additive manufacturer has focused attention on a
clause in the North American Free Trade Agreement that trade
experts say may have to be rewritten.
</P>
<P>
   Chapter 11, as the NAFTA clause is known, allows companies to
sue the governments of the United States, Canada or Mexico if
export opportunities are lost for reasons that have nothing to do
with normal commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Methanex Corp. of Vancouver, British Columbia, said Wednesday
that it was seeking damages because California had banned imports
of a gasoline additive called methyl tertiary butyl ether or MTBE,
which has been leaking into the West Coast water supply.
</P>
<P>
   This is only the second action to be filed against Washington in
the five years NAFTA has been in force. Last year, Loewen Group
Inc., a Canada-based funeral chain operator, filed a $725 million
suit. It contends that a $500 million judgment against it by a
Mississippi jury over fraudulent business practices was the
beginning of its ruin. Loewen is now in bankruptcy and operating
under court protection.
</P>
<P>
   Four suits have been filed by U.S. companies against Canada, and
two of these are in arbitration. Mexico has two cases in
arbitration. So far, Canada has paid $13 million to settle a claim
by Ethyl Corp. over a federal ban on its gasoline additive, a ban
that was eventually lifted because of provincial government
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   When Chapter 11 suits are filed, the resolution efforts move
from consultation to arbitration and then, if the claimant is
dissatisfied, to court. None of the claims has reached a court so
far. While consultation may bring changes to appease the claimants,
arbitrators and the courts have no power to change laws.
</P>
<P>
   Currently in arbitration in Canada is a claim by Pope &AMP; Talbot
Inc., a Washington state lumber producer, for $507 million. It
operates three mills in the province of British Columbia, and it
says the softwood lumber agreement between Canada and the United
States gives unfair export advantages to companies in three other
provinces.
</P>
<P>
   Also in arbitration is a claim for $20 million by S.D. Myers
Inc. of Ohio. It is based on Ottawa's decision to ban exports of
hazardous waste to a Myers treatment plant between November 1995
and February 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Merkin, a Washington-based trade consultant, said the
amount Methanex was seeking, and the prospect of more suits _
especially because of new state environmental laws _ were reasons
for the United States to join Canada in wanting to restrict access
to compensation through Chapter 11.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian Trade Minister Sergio Marchi has said he wants limits
written into the clause, primarily to insulate the federal
government from suits filed by U.S. companies that have been hurt
by laws passed by lower levels of government. He has proposed
adding an ``interpretive note'' to the trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Merkin said that while U.S. trade officials might support such
an appendix to NAFTA, the Clinton administration would have a tough
time getting the change approved by Congress. And, he said, U.S.
exporters would lobby against any revision that limited their
ability to sue Canada or Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Others argue that relatively few suits have been filed and that
it is too early to revise the trade pact.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a flood, and there are no decisions on the merits of
these cases yet,'' said Joseph DePencier, a trade lawyer in
Canada's Justice Ministry. ``Once we have a few decisions the
governments will know whether we need to clarify the intention of
the parties when the agreement was negotiated.''
</P>
<P>
   He said trade officials from the three countries regularly meet
to evaluate how NAFTA is working, and Chapter 11 is invariably
discussed.

<P>
   COLOGNE, Germany _ The United States and Russia reached an
agreement Friday to allow 3,600 Russian troops to participate in
the NATO peacekeeping operation in Kosovo, nailing down the final
elusive plank in the security framework meant to stabilize the
war-ravaged province.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton hailed the accord, saying he was ``very
pleased,'' with a deal meant to end a week-long standoff that has
sown confusion inside Kosovo and undermined trust between
Washington and Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a good day. We are achieving our objectives
now,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will work,'' he said of the agreement. ``I expect
it will be honored.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is here for the three-day summit of the leaders of the
so-called Group of Seven industrial powers. Russian President Boris
Yeltsin is scheduled to joint the G-7 leaders here on Sunday for
what's called the G-8 leaders' summit.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's agreement places Russian troops under NATO command and
required Moscow to drop its insistence that Russian troops be
assigned their own territory to control inside Kosovo, a demand
that had been the key sticking point throughout weeks of talks
among Russian and NATO officials.
</P>
<P>
   The accord was hammered out during three days of negotiations
among Defense Secretary William Cohen, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and their Russian counterparts -- Defense Minister Igor
Sergeyev and Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov -- in Helsinki, Finland.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and Albright were scheduled to present the agreement on
Saturday to the North Atlantic Council -- NATO's political arm --
at NATO headquarters near Brussels, Belgium. The NAC was expected
to quickly approve the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement brought to an end a torturous closing chapter in
the effort to find a formula for peacekeeping in Kosovo that would
permit a face-saving way for Russian troops to serve in an
operation commanded by Moscow's Cold War nemesis.
</P>
<P>
   NATO was formed 50 years ago as the strategic counterweight to
the military threat of the former Soviet Union. Russia remains
deeply suspicious of NATO's motives, largely resentful of its post
Cold War operations and was deeply opposed to the alliance's 78-day
bombing campaign against Yugoslavia targeting Serb repression in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In a final act of defiance, some 200 Russian troops sped into
Kosovo in the early morning hours last Saturday from peacekeeping
duties in Bosnia -- another province of the former Yugoslavia --
beating NATO peacekeepers into the troubled province, and taking up
posts at the airport near the provincial capital of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, right after the Yugoslav government had agreed to
withdraw from Kosovo and NATO had ended its bombing campaign, NATO
and Russian officials were still debating what role Russia should
play in Kosovo. The hang-up was NATO's insistence that Russian
troops operate under NATO command.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's National Security Adviser, Samuel E. ``Sandy'' Berger,
conceded Friday that the administration had yet to penetrate the
fog of uncertainty surrounding Russia's troop deployment last week.
</P>
<P>
   It remained unclear, for example, whether Yeltsin ordered the
deployment -- after assuring the White House that it would not go
forward -- or whether it was ordered by the Russian Defense
Ministry, or whether it was simply a potentially dangerous bit of
freelancing by unit commanders.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of possibilities about who ordered what
when and who knew what when,'' Berger said. ``We have to operate as
if any of them might be true.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton played up the fact that the Russian presence will help
allay the concerns of Serb civilians and protect Serb religious and
cultural sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's quite important that every effort be made to
secure both the physical sites and the personal security of the
Serb minority as well as the Kosovar Albanian majority,'' Clinton
said. ``We think it will give confidence to (Serbs) that the
Russians are in more than one sector.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia and Serbia, which share religious and ethnic ties, are
long-standing allies.
</P>
<P>
   Under Friday's accord, about 2,850 Russian troops will not
operate their own sector -- as Moscow had sought -- but will
instead be dispersed across three separate sectors, one controlled
by U.S. forces, a second by Germans and the third by French.
</P>
<P>
   Russian troops will report to their own officers, who in turn
will take orders from the commanders in control of each sector.
Those commanders, in turn, report to the ranking NATO commander in
charge of the overall operation, British Maj. Gen. Sir Michael
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Asked at a press conference in Helsinki whether Russian troops
would command their own sector, Sergeyev conceded that Russia had
instead settled on the ``alternative solution'' insisted upon by
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have found solutions to the issue,'' Sergeyev said, ``and
we are satisfied with the results of our work.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 750 Russian troops will be assigned some security
functions and other tasks -- such as vehicle maintenance, control
of parking slots, shuttle bus operation and public affairs -- at
the Pristina airport.
</P>
<P>
   The airport will remain under Jackson's control, however, with
NATO forces responsible for all flight operations, ground controls
and tower functions. The airport will be accessible to all
participants in the Kosovo peacekeeping operation, called KFOR,
under the terms of Friday's accord.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian troops, consisting of five battalions, will augment
the main KFOR force of some 50,000 NATO troops -- including 7,000
Americans.

RETURNING REFUGEES ALERTED TO MINE DANGERS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACE, Macedonia _ Heading back into a homeland laced with
deadly land mines, some 10,000 Albanian Kosovar refugees flooded
across the border here Friday.
</P>
<P>
   As the column of returning families in beat-up taxis, tractors,
and on foot wound its way toward the final checkpoint at the
border, UNICEF workers handed out leaflets and hung posters showing
how to identify and avoid land mines.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are flooding back in to Kosovo to go to their homes. We
cannot stop them, so all we can do is do our best to educate them
on the dangers of the land mines,'' said Astrid Zangenderen Stort,
a spokeswoman for the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials say that Kosovo is the most heavily mined real
estate in the world right now, although the full extent of the
danger will not be known until anti-land mine teams begin the
arduous task of locating and then removing the buried explosive
devices.
</P>
<P>
   The task could take years, officials say.
</P>
<P>
   In Kacanik, a town just inside the border, UN officials report
that 160 land mines were found and cleared in the last two days.
</P>
<P>
   ``If 160 land mines are found in one small town, then that is a
very alarming indication of what we're going to be dealing with,''
said Zangenderen Stort.
</P>
<P>
   To date, UN officials say, seven land mines have exploded,
causing three deaths and approximately six severe injuries. As
impatient refugees ignore the UN officials' warnings and return to
their homes, many fear it is only a matter of time until more are
injured or killed.
</P>
<P>
   The land mines are scattered in fields and in wooded areas on
the outskirts of towns. There are also many reports of
booby-trapped homes with explosive devices triggered to doors and
with trip wires.
</P>
<P>
   The UN commissioner's offices in Prizren, for example, were
found booby trapped.
</P>
<P>
   UNICEF is heading up the awareness campaign and urging refugees
to wait until the land mines can at least be marked before
returning home.
</P>
<P>
   The pamphlets and posters are brightly colored cartoon
depictions of land mines and are intended to grab the attention of
children, who are often the victims of land mines because the
devices can bear a cruel resemblance to toys.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some shaped like jacks and some that look like a
dart. They are intriguing to children,'' said Julia Spry-Leverton,
a UNICEF official heading up the education campaign.
</P>
<P>
   She said UNICEF is also using mimes and acrobats in schools and
day care centers in the refugee camps to try to educate children
about how to identify and avoid land mines.
</P>
<P>
   Teams of experts from as far away as Laos and as close by as
Sarejevo are descending on Kosovo. They are working first with
Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas and local residents to try to
pinpoint the locations of the Serb-planted mines.
</P>
<P>
   They are also waiting for Serb forces to hand over maps of the
mine fields, which could potentially save many lives.

   The removal process is gruelling and dangerous and will take

Everywhere there are land mines,'' he added as four younger

still we have to go back.''

   Mohammed Velia, 38, was returning with his two brothers and

   ``It is a risk to return, but we have to be in our homes,'' he

GILLETE SHARES TAKE A HIT ON NEGATIVE EARNINGS OUTLOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   BOSTON -- Gillette Co. shares tumbled Friday as Wall Street
reacted to an announcement by the world's largest maker of razors
and blades that profits again won't meet analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   In a frenzy of trading, Gillette shares plummeted to a low of 41
1/4 before recovering somewhat to close down 11 percent at 42. It
was the single largest decline among companies in the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index Friday, and the biggest one-day drop in Gillette
shares since it issued its last profit warning in April. Friday
30.5 million Gillette shares traded hands, more than nine times its
average three-month daily volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to wonder if the wheels are starting to come off the
cart here,'' said Robert Izmirlian, a Standard &AMP; Poor's analyst who
Friday downgraded his recommendation to ``avoid,'' S&AMP;P's
second-lowest rating.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any confidence in what they're doing anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   In its third earnings warning in the last four quarters,
Gillette said late Thursday slower-than-expected recoveries in key
international markets would mean a 20 percent decline in
second-quarter earnings from the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Earnings per share are expected to fall to between 26 cents and
27 cents per share, the company said. Analysts had expected 29
cents, according to research firm First Call Corp.
</P>
<P>
   While Gillette's largest area of business _ razors and blades,
led by the popular Mach3 _ remained strong, the company said it was
surprised by weakness in Braun appliances, Papermate pens, and
toiletries.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was centered in markets outside the United States,
particularly Brazil, Germany, Japan, and Russia, where economic and
political turmoil has lingered much longer than Gillette
anticipated, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recovery is still coming,'' said Eric Kraus, a Gillette
spokesman. ``It's just that the pace is not what we had thought it
was going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The company continues to forecast improved earnings in the
second half of the year, with percentage increases in the ``high
single digits'' in the third quarter and ``the mid-teens'' in the
fourth quarter. Both are less than analysts had expected.
</P>
<P>
   Friday several analysts cut their ratings on the stock. Alice
Beebe Longley at Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette Securities Corp.
downgraded the stock to ``market perform'' from ``buy.'' Analyst
Sally Dessloch at J.P. Morgan Securities cut Gillette to
``long-term buy'' from ``buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillette shares have fallen about a third since they hit a
52-week high of 64 3/8 on March 23, slashing $24.8 billion from
their total value.

ZENGA'S RESCUE PLAN MAY BE WORKING FOR REVOLUTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Conservative tactics and optimism are usually considered
mutually exclusive terms. But they are the basis of player-coach
Walter Zenga's formula for rescuing the Revolution.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there are signs that Zenga's ideas are functioning. The
Revolution are more effective defensively than a year ago, and they
are at least acting like a hopeful team.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution have earned 5 points from the last four games
and, significantly, they have regained some confidence. Though they
lost the shootout to Columbus Wednesday, they never trailed in the
game. And in the last four games, they have trailed for a total of
only 37 minutes. This is a significant statistic since it indicates
that the Revolution are not constantly trying to recover from a
deficit, a situation which can take a large toll psychologically.
</P>
<P>
   Zenga presented a no-frills starting lineup against the Crew,
and the Revolution's aggressiveness paid off in a fourth-minute
Giovanni Savarese goal, set up by a Ted Chronopoulos steal and
cross. There will probably be some changes in the lineup when the
Revolution visit Tampa Bay Saturday for their third game in seven
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the other players and teams fear the Revolution,''
Savarese said. ``We have beaten the best teams, D.C. United and
Chicago. And we had a good half and could have beaten Columbus,
which is a team that has had a very good start to the season and
had every advantage, playing at home in a new stadium with everyone
supporting them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good group this year. I think we are on the right
track. Now it only depends on us.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 8 points separate the second-place Crew from the last-place
Miami Fusion and New York/New Jersey MetroStars. And, as the season
nears the halfway mark, the Revolution are poised to either take
command as a playoff contender or sink to their customary position
of scrounging to avoid the cellar.
</P>
<P>
   With 12 points in 13 games, the Revolution are slightly ahead of
last year's pace. But it was about this time last year that the
Revolution were slumping to a nine-game losing streak as former
coach Thomas Rongen, plus starters Mike Burns and Joe-Max Moore,
participated in the France '98 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are used to this kind of schedule,'' Savarese said. ``We've
had to do this before, and we have enough players to bring in in
case somebody gets tired. We don't know what the lineup will be,
but whatever decision the coaches make, we will support their
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we win, we will close in on Columbus, get ahead of Tampa
Bay, and put some distance between us and the lower teams.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Savarese, who has 46 goals in his MLS career, will likely miss
only two Revolution games if he joins Venezuela for the Copa
American tournament starting June 29 in Paraguay.

LAWRENCE STONE, 79, HISTORIAN OF CHANGING SOCIAL ORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Professor Lawrence Stone, a social historian whose broad view of
the past helped transform historical studies, died June 16 at his
home in Princeton, N.J. He was 79.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was Parkinson's disease, said his wife, Jeanne.
</P>
<P>
   Stone, who taught at Princeton University for 27 years, wrote on
a wide range of topics, including the social and economic position
of the English aristocracy, the nature of the English Revolution of
1640-1660, the history of education, medieval sculpture and family
life, including marital relations and the rise of divorce over the
last five centuries.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his work he examined profound changes in the social
order over a long time span, in contrast to a more conventional
approach restricted to the activities of the political elite. As
such, his work on England converged with a similar postwar
intellectual approach in France associated with Marc Bloch and
Lucien Febvre. It applies social science techniques to history,
using the tools of demography, economics, political science and
anthropology.
</P>
<P>
   The more usual view of history was expressed by Thomas Carlyle,
the 19th-century Scottish essayist who wrote that history ``is at
bottom the history of Great Men.'' If the traditional Carlyle
approach could be called history from the top down, the new history
was from the bottom up.
</P>
<P>
   Stone, who often found himself embroiled in polemics and
relished that fact, liked to call himself an exponent of
prosopography, or group biography. More could be learned, he
insisted, from the study of the history of the family, or of the
institution of divorce, than from even the most insightful
biography of Henry VIII or Anne Boleyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``History, as Professor Stone presented it to rapt audiences of
students and colleagues, cannot be confined to the tiny elite who
dominate events,'' said historian Robert Darnton, a Princeton
colleague. ``It involves entire populations.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone was not without critics. In 1985, Norman F. Cantor, a
history professor at New York University, wrote in the
neoconservative journal The New Criterion that Marxists, led by
Stone, were taking over the teaching of history. That charge, which
stemmed from Stone's early association with the English Christian
socialist historian R.H. Tawney, was vehemently denied in letters
to the editor by members of the Princeton history department and by
conservative scholars like Gertrude Himmelfarb and Jack Hexter.
Stone would only describe the charge as ``ridiculous.'' Cantor
repeated his accusation in Commentary and asserted that Princeton's
history department was in the clutches of ``the leftists.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Stone's scholarly books are ``The Crisis of the
Aristocracy, 1558-1641'' (1965), ``The Causes of the English
Revolution, 1529-1642'' (1972), ``The Family, Sex and Marriage in
England, 1500-1800'' (1977), and ``Broken Lives: Marital Separation
and Divorce in England, 1660-1857'' (1993).
</P>
<P>
   Born in Epsom, Surrey, in England, on Dec. 4, 1919, Lawrence
Stone studied at the Charterhouse School, the Sorbonne and Christ
Church, Oxford. His university studies were interrupted by war
service as a lieutenant in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   He received his B.A. and M.A. degrees from Oxford in 1946 and
remained there until 1962, first as a lecturer at University and
Corpus Christi colleges and then as a fellow of Wadham College.
</P>
<P>
   After two years at the Institute for Advanced Study in
Princeton, he joined the Princeton University faculty in 1963. He
served as chairman of the history department from 1967 to 1970 and
in 1968 became the founding director of the Davis Center for
Historical Studies, which was established to promote innovative
methods of historical research. He retired in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his wife, Stone is survived by two children,
Elizabeth Cecilia Stone Zimansky of Stony Brook, N.Y., and Robert
Lawrence Fawtier Stone of Manhattan.

 &HT;    Alabama may OK more Sunday sales of alcohol
 &HT;    By Marlon Manuel
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Alabama state legislators once were clearly
distinguished as wet or dry, depending on their views on alcohol.
Trying to forbid the sales of beer, wine and spirits any day _ not
just Sunday _ formed a heady, Baptist voting bloc.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's been a long time ago, though,'' said Joe Bob Mizzell,
director of church ethics for the Alabama State Baptist Convention.
``That's about 30 years ago that we could speak out against alcohol
and it did make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, nearly two-thirds of Alabama's 67 counties permit alcohol
sales. In Birmingham and Mobile, you can even go to the local
grocery store and buy a six-pack on Sunday  &Cx1f;  &Cx1f;  &Cx1f;  &Cx1f;  &Cx1f;  &Cx1f; _ something you
can't do in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Don Siegelman is reviewing a bill that would allow Sunday
sales in wet counties without a local vote. He has till midnight to
sign, veto or walk away, which would also kill the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever his decision, it appears that alcohol in Alabama has
dried up as a watermark political issue, especially among Christian
activists.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Ireland, an interdenominational Christian lobbyist who spoke
with the governor Friday, said the Sunday alcohol bill is a
critical test for his constituency. Religious activists already are
battling Siegelman over a proposed state lottery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not that we would be totally annihilated'' if Siegelman
approved Sunday sales, Ireland said. ``But it is reflective ... on
our ability to get something done.'' Broader Sunday alcohol sales
have been pushed by Marc Reynolds, the legislative liaison for the
Retirement Systems of Alabama, a $23 billion agency that
distributes pensions for state teachers and judges, among others.
</P>
<P>
   The retirement agency owns the Robert Trent Jones golf trail, a
collection of courses throughout Alabama. Reynolds said resorts in
South Carolina and Arizona use Alabama's limited Sunday alcohol in
their marketing.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Reynolds has lobbied the Legislature for a permit to
allow golf courses to sell alcohol on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``A small, vocal group always stymies us,'' he said. ``They're
the same group that's anti-gambling, anti-abortion, anti-alcohol.
Anything they perceive as a sin, they jump on the state government
to fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Siegelman has been less receptive to those pleas than his
predecessor, Republican Fob James, who made a name for himself as a
crusader for social conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure any organized religion has any influence with
Siegelman,'' said Mizzell. In northeast Alabama, where Sand
Mountain stands as the dominant feature, DeKalb County stands rock
solid against any liquor sales. ``It's the Bible Belt,'' said Wade
Gorham, manager of Gary's TV &AMP; Appliance in Fort Payne, where he
sells Simmons mattresses alongside RCA televisions. ``A majority of
people have strong beliefs and moral values. ... People want it dry
for their kids, for their family, to keep it a nice place.'' Rural
outposts may regard Sunday alcohol sales as another step lost to
immorality, said Wayne Flynt, an Auburn University history
professor, but it's hardly the shock it would have been in the
1950s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like people don't leave DeKalb County and go to
Nashville, where they have Sunday liquor sales, or go to Atlanta,
where they have Sunday liquor sales,'' Flynt said. ``Forty years
ago, it was rare to see anyone from Sand Mountain go to Atlanta.
But it's not that kind of assault on their culture today.''
</P>
<P>
   Tradition has kept DeKalb dry. The force of time will change
that, said Jim McGee, appointed Fort Payne city clerk in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of these days,'' McGee said, ``it will happen.

<P>
   SOC-WOMENSCUP _ The third Women's World Cup comes to America
starting today and with it some lofty expectations of elevating the
game worldwide. More than 450,000 tickets have been sold, including
an expected sellout at Giants Stadium for today's opener between
the U.S. and Denmark. More than $6 million in corporate
sponsorships has rolled in, and ABC/ESPN/ESPN2 will televise every

   w/SOC-MIAHAMM _ BERNARDS TOWNSHIP, N.J. _ Ask Mia Hamm about

crude profile of the American sports superstar these days. Ask her
about herself, and the phenomenon that has sprung up around her as
the glamour girl for her sport, and her face quickly flushes red
with embarrassment.(Parker, Atlanta Journal-Constitution). MOVED.

<P>
   SOC-MIA-HAMM _ Mia Hamm is often identified with North Carolina,
the school where both she and her I-can-do-anything-better-than-you
commercial co-star, Michael Jordan, won national championships. Yet
it was in Texas that Hamm, international soccer's all-time leading
scorer, first learned that sport and many others, including tackle
football. ``All our children have Texas roots,'' said Stephanie
Hamm, Mia's mother. Stephanie and Bill Hamm, a retired Air Force
colonel, settled in Austin three years ago and lived in Wichita
Falls and San Antonio when Mia was growing up. (Maher, Austin
American-Statesman).
</P>
<P>
   SOC-MICHELLE-AKERS _ Although Mia Hamm has become a glamorous
icon for women's soccer in general, and the U.S. team in
particular, 33-year-old Michelle Akers is considered its heart and
soul. The star of the first World Cup in 1991, Akers is nearing the
end of a lengthy career in which she has scored 102 goals, gone
through a turbulent marriage and divorce, suffered from chronic
fatigue syndrome and learned to play a new position. The Grand Old
Lady of women's soccer is still a vital part of a team trying to
get back the World Cup that eluded it in 1995. (Parker, Atlanta

 &HT;    County home to Heritage High OKs adding 3 school psychologists
 &HT;    By Leon Stafford
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Rockdale County schools plan to hire three more
psychologists, doubling the current staff, as part of its response
to the Heritage High School shootings.
</P>
<P>
   That would give Rockdale one psychologist for every 1,650
students. The national average is one for every 1,800 students, and
Georgia schools average one for every 2,200.
</P>
<P>
   Actually hiring the psychologists may not be easy. Alex Thomas,
president of the National Association of School Psychologists, said
they are in such high demand that the nation's colleges can't
graduate them fast enough for the market. About 1,900 school
psychologists graduate yearly.
</P>
<P>
   And the need for more school psychologists didn't start with the
recent spate of high school shootings, he said. It has been growing
for years because of the increased number of American children who
come to school unable to cope.
</P>
<P>
   ``The shootings highlighted the increased mental health problems
in youth,'' said Thomas, chairman of the educational psychology
department at Miami University of Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``They come to school with so much more baggage,'' Thomas said.
</P>
<P>
   Rockdale's board approved the hiring Thursday night at the
recommendation of a committee studying ways to make the district's
schools safer. Anthony ``T.J.'' Solomon, a 15-year-old sophomore at
Heritage, is accused of shooting six of his classmates May 20 as
they waited for school to begin in the commons area.
</P>
<P>
   Rockdale's three psychologists have evaluated about 250 students
a year. Because of the workload, they were unable to do additional
counseling, said counselor John Poidevant.
</P>
<P>
   The district may have to dip into its reserves to hire the last
psychologist because only two extra positions were funded in the
$77 million budget for the 1999-2000 school year, approved
Thursday. But board member Jim Borland said the position is too
important to let it slip through the financial cracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teachers were elated to find out that we were doing this,''
said Borland, who also heads the School Safety Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Allbritten, executive director of the Georgia Association
of Educators, commended Rockdale for ``being proactive.'' But he
said another solution would be to make sure that counselors _ who
traditionally deal with students whose problems are not severe _
are not burdened with paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you don't want to have is counselors being attendance
officers and psychologists being counselors,'' he said.

 &HT;    Minister faces felony Peeping Tom charge
 &HT;    By Will Anderson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Rev. Danny B. Moody may have slipped in the eyes
of the law, but he hasn't fallen from grace in the hearts of his
followers.
</P>
<P>
   Moody, 52, who has served as pastor of Mount Carmel Baptist
Church in Douglasville for 24 years, was arrested May 29 on a
felony Peeping Tom charge. Atlanta police allege Moody aimed his
Camcorder beneath the skirts of women while riding escalators at
Hartsfield International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Moody was released under $5,000 bond the same day.
</P>
<P>
   Almost three weeks later, Moody's wife, Brenda, said his
congregation still supports him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The church has been told about the charges against him, but
the church stands behind him by an overwhelming vote,'' Brenda
Moody said. ``The camera was an accident.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a police report, a witness, Mike Eyerly, saw Moody
ascending an escalator in Concourse B with his video camera pointed
under an 18-year-old woman's dress. He had concealed the small
hand-held device with a Braves baseball cap.
</P>
<P>
   When Eyerly asked Moody what he was doing, Moody replied, ``that
he was doing nothing and pulled the tape from the camcorder,'' the
report said. Eyerly argued with Moody and talked to the
18-year-old's mother. The mother became angry and demanded the
videotape.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, he didn't want to, but I was somewhat mad and upset,
so he did give it to me,'' the woman said. ``He asked me twice if I
would go to gate B-12 with him. He said his son was there.''
</P>
<P>
   When police viewed the videotape, they saw that Moody had been
filming at the airport from 10:31 a.m. to 1 p.m. and had videotaped
several other women on concourse trains and escalators.
</P>
<P>
   A court date has not been set for Moody. Clayton County District
Attorney Bob Keller said he does intend to prosecute.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a movie camera, and he was taking pictures of female
anatomy on escalators,'' Keller said. ``The could constitute a
criminal offense.

 &HT;    Georgia leaders: Gambling study rigged
 &HT;    By Peter Mantius
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia leaders were highly critical of a federal
gambling study released Friday that recommends limiting advertising
by lotteries and setting a nationwide minimum age of 21 for all
legal betting.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.), author of legislation creating the
study commission, said he plans to introduce a bill to impose a 1
percent tax on legal gambling proceeds to treat addicted gamblers
and their families. He said he may include other recommendations
from the report in his legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The Georgia Lottery contributes $200,000 a year _ or about .01
percent of its anticipated annual revenues _ to a state agency to
be used for gambling addiction programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine (the commission's report) will cause Georgia
to change its course,'' Lt. Gov. Mark Taylor said Friday. He said
he hoped federal lawmakers would not interfere with the states'
regulatory authority over gambling.
</P>
<P>
   The report, by the National Gambling Impact Study Commission,
estimates that America has 5.4 million pathological gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   It urged prohibiting or phasing out video gambling and
keno-style games, such as the Georgia Lottery's Quick Cash game.
The report was particularly harsh on video poker machines in South
Carolina, which it called ``the crack cocaine'' of gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Video gambling and casinos aren't allowed in Georgia. But the
state expects to collect about $2 billion this fiscal year from its
6-year-old lottery.
</P>
<P>
   The lottery is required by law to pay about 35 percent of its
proceeds to the state for education programs, including HOPE
college scholarships for students with 'B' averages,
pre-kindergarten classes for 4-year-olds and school technology and
construction projects.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who had not had time to read the report, said he
understood the nine-member commission was dominated by casino
interests and religious conservatives who oppose gambling. He said
he had expected the report to be critical of lotteries, which were
not represented on the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Lottery President Rebecca Paul also claimed the report
was biased. ``There's virtually no balance in terms of the lottery
side of the report,'' she said. ``Everything it recommended is
stuff we do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Advertising guidelines, we have. A citizens' advisory board,
we do. Background checks on employees, vendors, retailers, we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul said a recent Gallup poll showed 75 percent of Americans
favor state lotteries. ``If Congress looks at how people feel, the
report will have little if any impact on how lotteries actually
operate,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Another national group, the Public Sector Gaming Study
Commission, will provide a more balanced view of the impact state
lotteries have on their states, Paul said. She and Gov. Roy Barnes
are among the 11 members of the group, which expects to release its
report in January.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Paul helped obtain $250,000 in state funding for a
national study by the University of Georgia's Vinson Institute on
the economic benefits of the nation's 38 state lotteries. Hank
Huckaby, the institute's director, was the state budget director
for Gov. Zell Miller, who made the lottery the cornerstone of his
administration.

POLITICAL VOTE DOOMS LATEST GUN CONTROL EFFORT IN HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A passionate, three-day House debate over guns and
juvenile crime came to a jarring end Friday when the most ardent
advocates of gun control voted against a bill they said had been
watered down too much by amendments backed by the National Rifle
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The 280-147 defeat of the bill, coming nearly two months after
the high school shootings in Littleton, Colo., and an intensive
lobbying campaign by pro- and anti-gun lobbies, cast doubt on
whether Congress will agree on any measures to strengthen gun laws
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic turn of events led to rounds of political
finger-pointing in Capitol Hill hallways and press conferences.
Republican leaders said Democrats, who initially pushed hard for
new gun-control measures, were playing politics and defeated the
bill to make guns an issue in their 2000 campaign to win back the
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``We provided two-thirds of our (members) for the bill,'' said
Republican Whip Thomas DeLay of Texas. The Democrats who voted
against it, he said, ``chose politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrat leaders claimed that Republicans voted for so many
loopholes to the legislation that its impact would be to weaken,
not strengthen, existing laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leave it to the Republicans to tarnish the memories of those
children (in Littleton) by creating a bill with scores of
loopholes,'' said Representative John Conyers, a Michigan Democrat
and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was defeated by a vote of 280-147, with 197 of 207
Democrats opposing it.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in Cologne, Germany, responded angrily to the
earlier passage of the amendments that weakened the bill, saying
the vote was ``a great victory for the NRA, but it was a great
defeat for the safety of our children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people will not stand for this,'' the president
said in a statement.''
</P>
<P>
   However, it was the House's most senior Democrat _ John Dingell
of Michigan, a former board member of the NRA _ who introduced what
many of his fellow Democrats considered the ``killer'' amendment
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Dingell proposed limiting the period for law-enforcement
background checks on buyers at gun shows to 24 hours, down from the
three days proposed in both the original House bill and the
legislation passed by the Senate last month. With the support of 45
Democrats, the Dingell amendment passed, and a substitute measure,
allowing for a three-day check, failed.
</P>
<P>
   The substitute was offered by Representative Carolyn McCarthy, a
New York Democrat whose husband was killed and son severely injured
by a gunman on a Long Island train. The defeat of the McCarthy
proposal, which occurred at 1:20 a.m. Friday, led many Democrats to
say they would oppose the overriding bill.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Democrats who voted against the gun-control bill
Friday was Dingell himself, who cited ``amorphous reasons'' for his
objections to the legislation. Dingell declined to elaborate as he
headed into a House elevator as reporters pressed him for an
explanation.
</P>
<P>
   All lawmakers from Massachusetts, Vermont, Maine, Connecticut,
and Rhode Island opposed the final bill. New Hampshire's two
representatives, both Republicans, voted for it.
</P>
<P>
   The action by the House stands in contrast to the Senate, which
last month passed a three-day waiting period after Vice President
Al Gore cast a tie-breaking vote, reversing an earlier Senate vote
for a shorter background check.
</P>
<P>
   The House's defeat of the gun-control bill does not affect
companion juvenile justice legislation passed late Thursday by the
House. That bill expands the power of prosecutors to try young
offenders as adults and mandates some ``cultural'' remedies for the
outbreak of juvenile violence, including a provision that allows
states to let schools post the Ten Commandments in classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   But the defeat of the House gun-control bill is likely to be
problematic when a House-Senate conference committee tackles the
differences in the chambers' juvenile justice bills. The Senate
version contains a variety of gun-control measures, including child
safety locks and the three-day waiting period for gun show
purchases, while the House version does not.
</P>
<P>
   Some House members said Friday that it was possible for the
conference committee to take the unusual step of fashioning a final
bill incorporating all of the Senate's gun control measures. But
many agreed with Representative Constance A. Morella, a Maryland
Republican, who said that scenario was ``possible, but not
likely.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats promised to wage a public effort and prompt a public
outcry to put pressure on the conference committee to include the
gun measures. They noted that the Senate last month initially
rejected a three-day waiting period for gun show purchases but then
reversed itself after many constituents flooded the Capitol with
complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Following Friday's vote, there was much speculation about
whether Republicans had strategized to kill the gun-control bill
and blame the defeat on Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, said he
and many other Democrats opposed the bill because it was ``silly,
fradulent, and allowed the Republicans to say they did something
when they didn't.'' He called the Republicans ``the gang that can't
shoot straight, even the help of the NRA.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans said it made no sense for Democrats, who are in
the minority, to insist on passage of their own version of the
bill. Representative Bob Barr, the Georgia Republican, rejected
suggestions that the defeat would hurt the GOP in next year's
elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``If each member correctly read their constituency, none of them
should be hurt by it,'' said Barr, who voted for the gun-control
bill even though he said he disliked parts of it.
</P>
<P>
   When the gun-control bill died, so did amendments that would
have required child safety locks on guns and overturned a local
ordinance that forbids most residents in the District of Columbia
from possessing handguns in their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Representative Virgil H. Goode Jr., Democrat of
Virginia, proposed an amendment that would have gone farther,
allowing District residents to carry a concealed weapon. Goode
argued that the city's gun ban was unconstitutional, prompting an
angry response from the city's non-voting delegate, Eleanor Holmes
Norton.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gentleman has some nerve. Most of the guns that are
killing people in the District of Columbia come from the state of
the gentleman from Virginia,'' Norton said. ``They come from his
state. Get off my back. Get out of my business.'' The Goode
amendment was defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Before the final vote, Representative Tom G. Tancredo, a
Colorado Republican whose district includes Columbine High School,
pleaded for bipartisan support of the one-day waiting period for
gun show purchases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I would be standing before this body and
asking them to vote for a bill that contains any type of gun
control,'' Tancredo said. But he said the shootings in Littleton
had changed that. ``Nobody will be the same after April 20, 1999,''
said Tancredo, who voted against the Democratic proposal for a
three-day background check.

EMOTIONAL DEBATE FILLED WITH ANGER, FRUSTRATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House chamber was, for once, silent. Even as
the clock ticked well past midnight, Congress paused its grinding
debate over gun control early Friday morning to watch a woman cry
at the podium.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Carolyn McCarthy had told her story before: of
the gunman who killed her husband and severely wounded her son
during a shooting spree on the Long Island Railroad. But in the
midst of a vitriolic debate _ as Congress grappled with core
beliefs ranging from individual freedom to prayer _ McCarthy's
two-minute speech became a symbol of how personal the entire debate
was, and why, for the first time since the impeachment of President
Clinton, everyone was so upset.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am Irish, and I am not supposed to cry in front of anyone,''
McCarthy, a Democrat from Long Island, N.Y., said quietly, wiping
both eyes. ``But I made a promise a long time ago. I made a promise
to my son and to my husband.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there was anything that I could do to prevent one family
from going through what I have gone through and every other victim
that I know have gone through, then I have done my job. Let me go
home. Let me go home.''
</P>
<P>
   When McCarthy was finished, the House erupted in applause. The
debate then moved on, and her proposal for tougher restictions on
sales at gun shows was voted down. The debate continued into Friday
afternoon, when a vote killed the overall measure at hand _ a gun
bill viewed as too weak by strict gun-control advocates such as
McCarthy, and too invasive by ardent gun-rights advocates.
Throughout, there were moments of grief, anger, frustration. And,
at times, disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   Just two months after the shooting at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo., in which 15 people died, it appeared to many that
the gun-control issue was as politicized as ever.
</P>
<P>
   To Democrats, the powerful National Rifle Association still
seemed to be calling the shots, lobbying congressmen hard to weaken
even existing gun restrictions. To Republicans, it was the
Democrats who were playing politics _ trying to kill the bill in
order to paint the Republicans as soft on crime just in time for
next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guess what, guys? We get to do this late into the night a few
more times,'' Representative F. James Sensenbrenner, Republican
from Wisconsin, sarcastically announced after casting his vote in
favor of the bill but glimpsing at the electronic scoreboard long
enough to see it was going to fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like you're knocking your head against a wall,'' said
Representative Sheila Jackson Lee, a Texas Democrat, after voting
against it and leaving the chamber in obvious exhaustion.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone was tired. The debate on the floor had dragged on each
night until after midnight, keeping some members at work as late as
4 a.m. Friday morning. And it was only the latest in a string of
exhausting struggles over legislation in the 106th Congress, where
even routine appropriations bills have taken weeks to negotiate,
and where large pockets of both parties are pessimistic they will
get anything done.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert of Illinois was noticeably absent,
refusing to call on members to vote a particular way and calling it
it was a vote of conscience. But other familiar faces resurfaced _
especially members of the House Judiciary Committee, the panel that
voted to impeach Clinton and produced the team of House managers
that led Clinton's prosecution in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Didn't I prove to you folks over in the Senate that it takes a
lot to scare me?'' said Representative James Rogan, a Republican
from California.
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, the divisions were not drawn strictly along
partisan lines. Instead, it was longstanding passions on both sides
of the gun-control debate _ the sort of lifelong opinions that led
Democrat John Dingell of Michigan to lead the charge against the
Clinton administration. It was Dingell who offered an amendment
that opponents said would have weakened existing restrictions by
reducing the time allowed for background checks at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   His amendment in turn fueled the rage of gun-control advocates,
even sparking a moment of rowdiness in the chamber Thursday night
as Democrats burst into a chant, reportedly at the urging of Rhode
Island Democratic Representative Patrick Kennedy. As the votes were
being counted, they shouted in unison: ``Six more seats! Six more
seats!'' _ an apparent reference to the six seats that now separate
Democrats from being the majority party.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it was McCarthy's speech that clearly touched members the
most.
</P>
<P>
   She spoke for a little over two minutes, giving a speech
Minority Leader Richard Gephardt later described as the ``most
incredible speech I've ever seen on the House floor.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You could hear a pin drop. Every member was listening to every
word she said,'' said Gephardt, a Democrat from Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   And yet she had prepared none of it. She walked to the podium
with tears in her eyes and notecards in her hand. Then she tossed
the notes aside on order to speak, a spokeswoman said, ``from the
heart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am trying to stop criminals from being able to get guns.
That is all I am trying to do. This is not a game to me. This is
not a game to the American people,'' McCarthy said. ``If we do not
do it, shame on us, because I have to tell my colleagues, the
American people will not forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Twelve hours later, it was still unclear what would happen.
House Majority Leader Dick Armey shrugged when asked whether the
bill would pass just minutes before the vote. Members streamed into
the chamber to cast their vote, then stood staring at the
scoreboard, some with their jaws partly open as the bill
overwhelmingly failed. No one, it seemed, expected both parties to
be split _ a sign, some said, that members had voted how they
really felt.
</P>
<P>
   Outside in the speaker's lobby, Representative Barney Frank had
a different take. He assessed the recent history of bitter battles
in the House. This, he said, wasn't quite like impeachment, though
it was becoming a familiar act.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the difference between `King Lear' and `A Night at the
Opera,' '' said Frank, a Massachusetts Democrat. ``We've gone from
high drama to very low burlesque.''

FEDERAL PANEL URGES CURBS ON LEGALIZED GAMBLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EUN LEE KOH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Citing the financial and emotional toll that
gambling takes on millions of Americans, a federal commission
Friday urged state and local government to curb the explosive
growth of legalized gambling.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the nine-member National Gambling Impact Study
Commission contained 76 recommendations that urge lawmakers to
examine the good as well as the detrimental effects of gambling on
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   While enactment of the recommendations is doubtful, the report
presents a vivid picture of the growth in gambling and number of
problem gamblers. Commission members hope that at the very least,
the report will stir awareness and debate on the issue, while
gambling opponents will use the findings to buttress their push for
legal restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   The report ``will act like the surgeon general's 1964 report on
smoking and health,'' said Tom Grey, executive director of the
National Coalition Against Legalized Gambling, ``a wake up call for
America on the dangers of gambling.''
</P>
<P>
   Commission chairwoman Kay James, a gambling opponent, said at a
press conference that although legalized gambling had created
thousands of jobs, she was ``deeply disturbed by the impact of
gambling on individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Another commissioner, James Dobson, criticized gambling for
luring poor people into betting. ``It offers wealth without work,
success without sweat, and prosperity without perseverance,'' said
Dobson, who is also president of Focus on the Family, an
organization that says
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the National Opinion Research Center reported
that 2.5 million Americans are ``pathological'' gamblers; another 3
million are ``problem'' gamblers; and 15 million are ``at risk'' of
developing a gambling problem.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's report, submitted to the White House, Congress,
state and tribal leaders Friday, struck harder on ``convenience
gambling'' such as state lotteries and slot machines than on
casinos, by recommending a nationwide minimum age of 21 to place
bets. In states like Massachussetts, New Hampshire and Connecticut,
the minimum age is 18.
</P>
<P>
   Recommendations also include reducing state lottery
advertisements, banning bets on collegiate sports, prohibiting
gambling industries from contributing to political campaigns, and
removing automated teller machines from casino floors.
</P>
<P>
   The report also recommended that casinos post visible signs that
warn gamblers of the downsides of gambling and that a portion of
profits go to treatment programs for compulsive gamblers. In a
controversial move, the report also recommended a moratorium on
further expansion of legalized gambling.
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Morgaga, spokeswoman from the National Indian Gaming
Association, said the group agrees with ``80 percent'' of the
report's recommendations, but added that any pause in gaming
activities could be ``detrimental to the Indian community.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Economically, the Indian community is still playing catch-up
and gambling has been good for economic development,'' Moraga said.
</P>
<P>
   Legalized gambling has enjoyed a surge in popularity in the last
two decades. Thirty-seven states and the District of Columbia
succesfully run state lotteries and casinos operate in 10 states.
Native American tribes have also opened casinos in at least 22
states.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that revenues from legal wagering grew 1,600
percent from 1976 to 1997, with Americans spending more than $47
billion of their leisure activity money on gamgling.
</P>
<P>
   That popularity could make it difficult for the commission to
convince the public of the need for restrictions. A recent Gallup
poll showed nearly two-thirds of American adults approve of legal
gambling. Seventy-five percent said they approve of state
lotteries, and 67 percent acknowledged that opening a casino can
help a community's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Fahrenkopf, president of the American Gaming Association,
criticized the report's recommendation that barred the gambling
industry from contributing to political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millions of people work for this industry,'' Fahrenkopf said.
``To say they cannot contribute to campaigns is disenfranchising
all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The nine-member commission, appointed in 1996 by President
Clinton, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, and Senate Majority
Leader Trent Lott, held 250 hours of hearings throughout the
country and conducted studies to compile the report. The panel
included both gambling foes and industry supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Frank Wolf, a Virginia Republican and a gambling opponent
who sponsored the legislation creating the commission, said he
plans to introduce bills to enact some of the recommendations. Wolf
also said he may go further than the report and propose a federal
tax on gambling revenues and elimination of a tax deduction for
gambling losses.

<P>
   ONEIDA, N.Y. _ It began in the 1840s as a rejection of the world
at large, a breakaway utopian experiment that combined the dignity
of work with the joy of sex amid the upheaval wrought by the
Industrial Revolution. But it has evolved, primly enough, into the
nation's largest manufacturer of stainless steel knives, forks and
spoons.
</P>
<P>
   The original experiment, the Oneida Community, succumbed to the
tug of secular forces around it. And now its corporate descendant,
Oneida Ltd., is struggling not to fall off the economic tidal wave
of the late 20th century: globalization.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the global trend has contributed mightily, if sometimes
indirectly, to Oneida's success. Competition from Third World
countries has trimmed the number of flatware makers with factories
in the United States to just one _ Oneida _ from more than two
dozen 15 years ago. And globalization has made it easy for the
company to open a factory in Mexico and set up agreements with
manufacturers in China.
</P>
<P>
   It has also led to international alliances like one with CALP
SpA, an Italian maker of crystal that Oneida sells under its own
name.
</P>
<P>
   But with its imperatives of scale and, consequently, of
consolidation, global competition has also made Oneida a prime
takeover target. Three months ago, its chief rival, the Libbey
Corp., based in Toledo, Ohio, made a hostile play for the company,
causing no small uproar inside the stone fortress, complete with
its own ZIP code, that is Oneida's corporate headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   A marriage of the two medium-sized companies, some analysts say,
would let them fight off foreign competitors rather than hurling
china at each other. After all, Libbey controls the institutional
market in glassware, and Oneida controls the institutional market
for silverware.
</P>
<P>
   Both now make plates, and Oneida is trying to enter Libbey's
glassware business while Libbey is trying to get into Oneida's
flatware business. ``It's a phenomenal strategic fit,'' said Arnold
Ursaner, a managing director who follows Libbey for CJS Securities
in White Plains, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that Oneida has wanted none of it. In fact, the
company has been so opposed that senior management hasn't even
discussed the idea with anyone from Libbey. Every company has a
culture, and Oneida's seems deeply rooted in an old-fashioned
determination to go its own way.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Libbey fattened its offer to $625 million, or $37.50
a share, up from $500 million, or $30 a share. There was no
immediate response from Oneida. Its board, which unanimously
rejected the first offer, is expected to meet this week to consider
the new one.
</P>
<P>
   Oneida's stubbornness is based on a belief, not unfounded, that
it knows what it's doing. ``We've been able to prove to our
shareholders that the strategic plan that is in place is the best
value for them,'' said Peter D. Kallet, who was appointed chief
executive six months ago. The plan calls for steady growth through
joint ventures, licensing agreements and other steps to increase
sales with relatively low capital investment.
</P>
<P>
   But there seems to be at least some concern outside the
executive suite. Oneida's annual meeting, usually attended by a
couple of hundred semi-interested shareholders, was standing room
only this year, overflowing with more than 750 people and alive
with questions about the Libbey bid and Oneida's future. Kallet's
unequivocal response: The company is not for sale.
</P>
<P>
   A craving for independence is one legacy the company retains
from the Oneida Community. Among the landmarks dotting the sweep of
green Oneida property is the Proxy Oak, planted in the mid-1960s
after the company held off a takeover bid from a pair of investors
and now billowing some 50 feet high.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's in memory of a victory,'' said John D. Raynsford, a
soft-spoken print production manager who is descended on his
mother's side from the original community. ``We kept the purchasing
company off our backs.'' Even after last year, when the company had
one of its worst financial performances in recent memory, Kallet
and other executives sound briskly confident that they would be
able to hold off any buyers by sticking to their strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Investors in Oneida's stock have been bounced around over the
last year. A year ago, the shares traded at more than $32. In
October, the price plummeted to $12.813, and on Friday it closed at
$31.0625, thanks in large part to the Libbey offer.
</P>
<P>
   At Libbey, where the chief executive sounds annoyed that Oneida
doesn't even want to discuss a merger, there is a different
strategy. The consolidation in the food service and retail
industries leaves suppliers _ like Libbey and Oneida _ no choice
but to follow the same path, said John F. Meier, Libbey's chairman
and chief executive. ``The real competitor of the future is the
increasing global competition,'' he said. ``How do we best align
ourselves to compete? Five years from now, Libbey isn't going to be
losing sleep over Oneida's glassware. It's going to be over
glassware from the People's Republic of China.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese don't seem to worry Oneida management, and maybe
that stems from history, too. The Oneida Community, whose products
included animal traps and silk thread, adapted well to economic
shifts. The company, formed in 1879, branched out into carpet bags,
surgical tools and even, during wartime, shell casings and hand
grenades.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were always willing to try new ways to make money,'' said
Paul E. Gebhardt, a direct descendant of the community's founder,
John Humphrey Noyes. ``They were capitalists to their core.''
</P>
<P>
   Gebhardt designs flatware for Oneida, and his passion for craft
items like Russell Wright pottery seems more or less inherited,
though he buys them through Ebay, the Web auction site.
</P>
<P>
   Meier said he first raised the idea of a merger four years ago,
but his chief contact at Oneida, Gary Moreau, then the chief
operating officer, wound up resigning. (He is now president of
Lionel, the model train company, and serves on the Libbey board.)
``They have simply said `we're not interested, we prefer to remain
independent and we believe in the merits of our own strategic plan,
thank you very much,''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   So, taking the matter into his own hands, Meier has begun
meeting with some of Oneida's major shareholders, with what he says
are fruitful results. ``They see the wisdom of this offer,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   That may not mean they agree. One of the company's five biggest
shareholders, the Homestead Funds, listened to Meier earlier this
month. ``We think we understand what he's trying to accomplish,''
said Stuart Teach, the senior equity portfolio manager, who
controls about 10 percent of Oneida stock through the funds and a
separate pension group. ``As to whether we appreciate what he's
doing toward Oneida, that's another story. Oneida has a very fine
story to tell also.''
</P>
<P>
   After the offer was raised to $37.50 a share, however, Teach
sounded more interested in Libbey's case. ``Suffice to say, this
was a leap forward by the Libbey people,'' he said. Other major
shareholders, including Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co., would not
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Oneida went through a series of restructurings and
write-downs and closed a factory in Canada, all with the intent of
saving about $20 million a year. About 140 additional jobs are to
be trimmed this year through early retirements.

By TODD CAMP 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ ``He could spring 20 feet across space at the dizzying
heights of the forest top and grasp with unerring precision and
without apparent jar a limb waving wildly in the path of an
approaching tornado ... he could drop 20 feet at a stretch from
limb to limb in a rapid descent to the ground or he could gain the
utmost pinnacle of the loftiest tropical giant with the ease and
swiftness of a squirrel.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Edgar Rice Burroughs in ``Tarzan of the Apes''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Burroughs wrote those words in 1912. But after 47 film
adaptations _ making the ``Tarzan'' films second in number only to
``Dracula'' _ Hollywood has yet to accurately capture the ape-man.
Enter Disney, which opened its big summer animated feature
``Tarzan'' on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that you could understand that it's really the
marriage of `Tarzan of the Apes' and Disney,'' co-director Kevin
Lima said during a recent promotional sweep through Texas. ``It's
not just Edgar Rice Burroughs' novel. I can't even guess how a
purist will respond. I assume that there will be some who are very
angry, and some who are overjoyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering what Burroughs fans have had so far, you'd think
they'd be delighted. Johnny Weissmuller and the other loinclothed
lads who've swung through the trees may have done their best, but
come on. Gelled hair and a gleaming smile are hardly byproducts of
an adolescence spent with apes.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's vine king (given voice by actor Tony Goldwyn) is a more
simian, agile sort, with flapping dreadlocks, bulging, muscular
forearms and distinctive gorillalike mannerisms. He looks like a
monkey, man, and also (we hate to admit) a little like Miles
O'Keeffe in the 1981 Bo Derek picture ``Tarzan, the Ape Man.'' But
there's no doubt that the character lends itself to the freedom of
animation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can really mess around with his anatomy,'' Lima says. ``We
can give him a furrowed brow, strong jaw muscles. We can mess
around with his forearms, make them larger, just to make him
emulate, somewhat, gorilla anatomy. It would be really hard for an
actor to just work out those parts of his body.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-director Chris Buck was interested in the story for another
reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I related more to the journey of the apes, someone living with
apes,'' Buck says. ``Jane Goodall and Dian Fossey and their
journeys _ I'd watched all those National Geographic specials.''
</P>
<P>
   Buck says he wanted to relate to the story emotionally rather
than just to play up the adventure, so he and Lima strayed from the
studio's traditional cartoon musical path, recruiting Phil Collins
to record five new songs that act more as background pieces
throughout the film than as musical numbers. But despite the
presence of comic voices like Rosie O'Donnell as Tarzan's ape
buddy, Terk; Minnie Driver as Jane; Nigel Hawthorne as Professor
Porter; and Wayne Knight as Tantor the elephant, don't be surprised
if this ``Tarzan'' is darker and more intense than the average
offerings from the House of Mouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty early on, we knew that we wanted to portray the savage
world of the story, because we wanted Tarzan to overcome something,
to show he could survive in this world that wants to kill him, so
to speak,'' Lima says.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   IN THE JUNGLE, THE MIGHTY JUNGLE
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that everything should be made to look as natural as
possible. ... I see no reason why the animation should not be
excellent. The cartoon must be good. It must approximate Disney
excellence.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Edgar Rice Burroughs, writing to his son in 1936 after being
approached about doing an animated version of ``Tarzan''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Talk about pressure. Buck and Lima say they were grateful not to
have known of Burroughs' letter until after the production was
completed. But they also believe that their picture lives up to its
creator's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't going for a realistic look, we were going for a
naturalistic look,'' says Buck, who along with Lima and a small
team of animators visited Africa to capture the film's distinct
style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, animation is on an open plain,'' Buck says. ``You
create a flat surface or a stage for the characters to work on
because it's really difficult to have them interact with their
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided early on that we were going to try and do this.
Let's put the animals and Tarzan knee-deep in the world,'' Lima
says. ``It led in a way to Deep Canvas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep Canvas'' is the name given to the technique the studio
pioneered to allow Tarzan to interact more fully with his jungle
world. The technique sets ``Tarzan'' apart from the studio's other
African-based animated films _ ``The Lion King,'' which was set on
the open plains of the Serengeti, and ``The Jungle Book,'' which
``takes place very much in that theatrical stage world,'' Lima
says.
</P>
<P>
   For each scene, they would build a computer set, ``in a sense,
our jungle gym for that moment,'' Lima says. They would do a
computerized camera move through the set following a stand-in for
the character. Once the speed of the scene was determined, the
animator goes to work in 2-D while the background painter actually
paints three-dimensionally in the computer.
</P>
<P>
   The effect is stunning. Some of Tarzan's breakneck treks through
the trees rival even the best amusement park stomach-churners. Glen
Keane, Tarzan's supervising animator, patterned the character's
movement through the trees after his skateboarding son, while
Tarzan's rescue of Jane from a horde of angry baboons was designed
to feel like a roller-coaster ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``They go up in the trees, and before they start going down
there's that little pause,'' Buck says. ``Then ... down they go
with the big chase sequence.''

 ONEIDA, N.Y.: early retirements.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the first quarter of this year, sales rose 10 percent from
the corresponding period a year earlier, while earnings zoomed 25
percent. That is not counting a one-time $18 million loss from
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their information technology is good, and that's critical to
being competitive,'' said John B. Walthausen, an analyst for C.L.
King &AMP; Associates in New York. ``In some ways, they are
old-fashioned. In other ways, I don't think they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Oneida has never bothered much with marketing itself to Wall
Street. About 17 percent of the stock is owned by its employees,
and most of the rest by institutional investors. Walthausen is the
only analyst in the country who covers the company.
</P>
<P>
   But behind its reserved facade, Oneida aggressively seeks to
dominate the table-setting business, starting with stainless
flatware. Its luxury patterns are on view at Macy's, and its budget
brands appear on airline trays at 35,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Its china patterns show up on bridal registries, at Disney World
buffets and, according to Edward W. Thoma, the company's senior
vice president for finance, at the Turning Stone casino, run by the
Oneida Nation, just a few miles from company headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The company has succeeded by straddling the worlds of consumer
goods and institutional products. Its china brands include Noritake
and Buffalo China, a widely used restaurant brand. It also makes
silver-plated serving pieces for the hotel and restaurant trade at
a plant in Shanghai, and recently signed a deal that will have
Amway representatives selling its flatware.
</P>
<P>
   And in a move that no doubt stuck in the Libbey craw, Oneida
entered the food service glassware business last year. Using
products bought from a Turkish maker, Oneida is urging hotel and
restaurant customers to buy glasses as part of its food service
package.
</P>
<P>
   Libbey sued Oneida earlier this year, maintaining that seven of
the glass designs were intentional copies of long-established
Libbey styles. The lawsuit, which Oneida says has no basis, is
pending.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going right at the heart of Libbey's core business,''
Walthausen said of Oneida's latest move.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies are roughly the same size. Libbey has a market
capitalization of $533 million, compared with $446.9 million for
Oneida. Their annual sales equal those figures almost to the
dollar. Neither company is big enough, in other words, to throw its
weight around in the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oneida's shareholders are probably being disadvantaged by
Oneida management not even being willing to sit down and talk,''
said Ursaner of CJS Securities. ``The new CEO seems very focused on
power and control.''
</P>
<P>
   Kallet says it's not up to him, but to the board.
</P>
<P>
   ``The consumer has confidence when they buy our product,'' he
said. ``We have the attitude that the customer is right. And if
they lose a spoon, they can get another spoon. We're going to be
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Kallet, 52, seems to have been born with an Oneida spoon in his
mouth. He joined the company directly out of Syracuse University in
1967 and has worked in practically every area of its business, most
recently running the food service division. He took over as chief
executive from William D. Matthews, who had held the job for 12
years and remains chairman, with about 1 percent of the company's
stock in his name.
</P>
<P>
   Kallet's rise illustrates Oneida's propensity to promote from
within. Even the company's outside directors are largely drawn from
the immediate vicinity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not afraid to bring in new people, if there's a
requirement,'' Kallet said, ticking off three senior management
jobs that have been filled by outsiders. ``Over the last six or
seven years, we've brought in more non-Oneida-raised people.''
</P>
<P>
   If growth is the object, why doesn't Oneida buy Libbey? ``That's
been examined and rejected as well,'' Thoma said. ``If you're going
to make an acquisition, you look for one with the least overlap,
because that causes redundancies. There isn't a lot of synergy in
that one.''
</P>
<P>
   Synergy was another idea that worked for the Oneida Community.
The daily life of its 300 members revolved around the Mansion
House, an angular red-brick complex that today is a kind of
community center and senior citizens' residence. The company sold
the structure several years ago, though it continues to use some
rooms for various functions.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Oneida Community called themselves
``Perfectionists'' and believed that God demanded variety in all
aspects of life, including sex. Monogamy was considered impure, and
older community members were assigned to introduce younger ones to
what they considered the holy pleasures of the flesh, according to
``Without Sin,'' a 1993 history of the community by Spencer Klaw.
</P>
<P>
   Everything outside the community was called ``the World.''
Children were raised collectively, spending much of their time in a
house that was connected to the Mansion House by an underground
tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   The commune officially disbanded in 1881, although former
members continued to operate the company for some time. Vestiges of
the community are everywhere, from Thanksgiving reunions of Noyes
descendants to Oneida's stock symbol, OCQ, which stands for Oneida
Community Quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perfectionism really carried the day for them,'' Gebhardt
said, recalling his ancestors. ``In business, they always felt they
could better the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   But just as the Oneida Community was ultimately consumed by
``the World,'' the world economy could become an issue for Oneida
Ltd. Meier, Libbey's chief executive, is relentless about achieving
strength through unity. ``We are both public companies, and we have
an obligation to sustain as best we can long-term shareholder
value,'' he said. ``Our offer is still out there.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   It hasn't been much of a year for animation thus far: Warner
Bros.' ``King and I'' earned a much-deserved early dethronement,
and Disney's ``Doug's 1st Movie'' will, we hope, also be Doug's
``last'' movie. But ``Tarzan'' aside, there are plenty of animated
projects coming to theaters this year:
</P>
<P>
   ``South Park: Bigger, Longer &AMP; Uncut'' Paramount is banking big
on Trey Parker and Matt Stone's construction paper-cutout hit from
the Comedy Central cable network. Though considered ``animation''
only in the crudest sense (and we mean ``crude'' in a number of
ways), ``South Park'' follows the adventures of a band of
foul-mouthed grade-schoolers. Opens June 30.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iron Giant'' Warner hopes to the wash out the bad taste
that ``The King and I'' left in the mouths of cartoon aficionados
with this impressive-looking feature. Set in the '50s, the story
follows a young boy who befriends a giant machine that crashes to
Earth. Voices include Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick Jr., John
Mahoney and Cloris Leachman. Opens Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``Princess Mononoke'' Miramax tries to cash in on America's
fascination with Japanese animation with this groundbreaking anime
title from writer/director Hayao Miyazaki. It's the story of an
epic battle between nature and encroaching civilization. Voices
include Gillian Anderson, Billy Crudup, Claire Danes, Minnie Driver
and Billy Bob Thornton. Opens in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``Toy Story 2'' Pixar wasn't content with following its smash
hit ``Toy Story'' with a slapped-together sequel for
direct-to-video, so here's a second one. This time, Woody gets
snatched up by a wicked toy collector; Buzz Lightyear and the other
playthings must rescue him. Voices include Tom Hanks, Tim Allen,
Joan Cusack, Kelsey Grammer and Wayne Knight. Opens in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``Fantasia 2000'' Disney updates its 1940 classic in time for a
millennial sneak preview in December at Carnegie Hall. Three
original segments return, along with new sequences that include
Camille Saint-Saens' ``Carnival of the Animals,'' Ottorino
Respighi's ``Pines of Rome'' and Donald Duck's spin on the story of
Noah's Ark set to Sir Edward Elgar's ``Pomp and Circumstance.''
Beginning Jan. 1, 2000, the film plays IMAX theaters around the
country. The Fort Worth Museum of Science and History's Omni
Theater is still in the discussion phase.

   Burroughs wrote those words in 1912. But after 47 film
adaptations _ making the ``Tarzan'' films second in number only to
``Dracula'' _ Hollywood has yet to accurately capture the ape-man.
Enter Disney, which opened its big summer animated feature
``Tarzan'' on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope that you could understand that it's really the
marriage of `Tarzan of the Apes' and Disney,'' co-director Kevin
Lima said during a recent promotional sweep through Texas. ``It's
not just Edgar Rice Burroughs' novel. I can't even guess how a
purist will respond. I assume that there will be some who are very
angry, and some who are overjoyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering what Burroughs fans have had so far, you'd think
they'd be delighted. Johnny Weissmuller and the other loinclothed
lads who've swung through the trees may have done their best, but
come on. Gelled hair and a gleaming smile are hardly byproducts of
an adolescence spent with apes.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's vine king (given voice by actor Tony Goldwyn) is a more
simian, agile sort, with flapping dreadlocks, bulging, muscular
forearms and distinctive gorillalike mannerisms. He looks like a
monkey, man, and also (we hate to admit) a little like Miles
O'Keeffe in the 1981 Bo Derek picture ``Tarzan, the Ape Man.'' But
there's no doubt that the character lends itself to the freedom of
animation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can really mess around with his anatomy,'' Lima says. ``We
can give him a furrowed brow, strong jaw muscles. We can mess
around with his forearms, make them larger, just to make him
emulate, somewhat, gorilla anatomy. It would be really hard for an
actor to just work out those parts of his body.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-director Chris Buck was interested in the story for another
reason.
</P>
<P>
   ``I related more to the journey of the apes, someone living with
apes,'' Buck says. ``Jane Goodall and Dian Fossey and their
journeys _ I'd watched all those National Geographic specials.''
</P>
<P>
   Buck says he wanted to relate to the story emotionally rather
than just to play up the adventure, so he and Lima strayed from the
studio's traditional cartoon musical path, recruiting Phil Collins
to record five new songs that act more as background pieces
throughout the film than as musical numbers. But despite the
presence of comic voices like Rosie O'Donnell as Tarzan's ape
buddy, Terk; Minnie Driver as Jane; Nigel Hawthorne as Professor
Porter; and Wayne Knight as Tantor the elephant, don't be surprised
if this ``Tarzan'' is darker and more intense than the average
offerings from the House of Mouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty early on, we knew that we wanted to portray the savage
world of the story, because we wanted Tarzan to overcome something,
to show he could survive in this world that wants to kill him, so
to speak,'' Lima says.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   IN THE JUNGLE, THE MIGHTY JUNGLE
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that everything should be made to look as natural as
possible. ... I see no reason why the animation should not be
excellent. The cartoon must be good. It must approximate Disney
excellence.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Edgar Rice Burroughs, writing to his son in 1936 after being
approached about doing an animated version of ``Tarzan''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Talk about pressure. Buck and Lima say they were grateful not to
have known of Burroughs' letter until after the production was
completed. But they also believe that their picture lives up to its
creator's expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't going for a realistic look, we were going for a
naturalistic look,'' says Buck, who along with Lima and a small
team of animators visited Africa to capture the film's distinct
style.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, animation is on an open plain,'' Buck says. ``You
create a flat surface or a stage for the characters to work on
because it's really difficult to have them interact with their
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided early on that we were going to try and do this.
Let's put the animals and Tarzan knee-deep in the world,'' Lima
says. ``It led in a way to Deep Canvas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep Canvas'' is the name given to the technique the studio
pioneered to allow Tarzan to interact more fully with his jungle
world. The technique sets ``Tarzan'' apart from the studio's other
African-based animated films _ ``The Lion King,'' which was set on
the open plains of the Serengeti, and ``The Jungle Book,'' which
``takes place very much in that theatrical stage world,'' Lima
says.
</P>
<P>
   For each scene, they would build a computer set, ``in a sense,
our jungle gym for that moment,'' Lima says. They would do a
computerized camera move through the set following a stand-in for
the character. Once the speed of the scene was determined, the
animator goes to work in 2-D while the background painter actually
paints three-dimensionally in the computer.
</P>
<P>
   The effect is stunning. Some of Tarzan's breakneck treks through
the trees rival even the best amusement park stomach-churners. Glen
Keane, Tarzan's supervising animator, patterned the character's
movement through the trees after his skateboarding son, while
Tarzan's rescue of Jane from a horde of angry baboons was designed
to feel like a roller-coaster ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``They go up in the trees, and before they start going down
there's that little pause,'' Buck says. ``Then ... down they go
with the big chase sequence.''

<P>
   It hasn't been much of a year for animation thus far: Warner
Bros.' ``King and I'' earned a much-deserved early dethronement,
and Disney's ``Doug's 1st Movie'' will, we hope, also be Doug's
``last'' movie. But ``Tarzan'' aside, there are plenty of animated
projects coming to theaters this year:
</P>
<P>
   ``South Park: Bigger, Longer &AMP; Uncut'' Paramount is banking big
on Trey Parker and Matt Stone's construction paper-cutout hit from
the Comedy Central cable network. Though considered ``animation''
only in the crudest sense (and we mean ``crude'' in a number of
ways), ``South Park'' follows the adventures of a band of
foul-mouthed grade-schoolers. Opens June 30.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``The Iron Giant'' Warner hopes to the wash out the bad taste
that ``The King and I'' left in the mouths of cartoon aficionados
with this impressive-looking feature. Set in the '50s, the story
follows a young boy who befriends a giant machine that crashes to
Earth. Voices include Jennifer Aniston, Harry Connick Jr., John
Mahoney and Cloris Leachman. Opens Aug. 6.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``Princess Mononoke'' Miramax tries to cash in on America's
fascination with Japanese animation with this groundbreaking anime
title from writer/director Hayao Miyazaki. It's the story of an
epic battle between nature and encroaching civilization. Voices
include Gillian Anderson, Billy Crudup, Claire Danes, Minnie Driver
and Billy Bob Thornton. Opens in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``Toy Story 2'' Pixar wasn't content with following its smash
hit ``Toy Story'' with a slapped-together sequel for
direct-to-video, so here's a second one. This time, Woody gets
snatched up by a wicked toy collector; Buzz Lightyear and the other
playthings must rescue him. Voices include Tom Hanks, Tim Allen,
Joan Cusack, Kelsey Grammer and Wayne Knight. Opens in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   ``Fantasia 2000'' Disney updates its 1940 classic in time for a
millennial sneak preview in December at Carnegie Hall. Three
original segments return, along with new sequences that include
Camille Saint-Saens' ``Carnival of the Animals,'' Ottorino
Respighi's ``Pines of Rome'' and Donald Duck's spin on the story of
Noah's Ark set to Sir Edward Elgar's ``Pomp and Circumstance.''
Beginning Jan. 1, 2000, the film plays IMAX theaters around the
country. The Fort Worth Museum of Science and History's Omni
Theater is still in the discussion phase.

GROUP PLANS FATHER'S DAY PROTEST OF DAUGHTER KIDNAPPER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MACQUARRIE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As many as 200 demonstrators are expected outside Stephen
Fagan's mansion in Palm Beach Sunday _ Father's Day _ to protest
what they consider lenient treatment by the Massachusetts judicial
system.
</P>
<P>
   Marianne Mulky, who organized the demonstration, said parents of
children who have been abducted by spouses and strangers will fill
the oceanside street to tell their stories and assail Fagan's
sentence for kidnapping his two small daughters from Massachusetts
in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan agreed to plead guilty to the felony last month in
exchange for five years' probation, 2,000 hours of community
service, and a $100,000 donation to the New England Home for Little
Wanderers.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan has said he fled with the girls to Florida to rescue them
from an alcoholic, neglectful mother. The daughters _ 5 and 2 at
the time of the kidnapping _ were told by Fagan that their mother
had died in a car crash. The girls did not know the truth until
Fagan, who had changed his name and concocted a prestigious fake
resume, was arrested in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts sentence ``was the biggest slap in the face we
could have ever had. It just makes it so much harder,'' said Mulky,
who suspects her ex-husband in her son's disappearance 25 years
ago. ``A lot of men have responded to this protest and said,
`That's terrific.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Fagan, after a proposal from his attorney, was ordered by
Middlesex (Mass.) Superior Court Judge Peter M. Lauriat to perform
community service at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in nearby
Riviera Beach, Fla. But after an outraged letter from former
Florida Governor Claude Kirk, a World War II and Korean War
veteran, Florida probation officials agreed to seek an alternate
location for Fagan to perform the 2,000 hours of unpaid work.
</P>
<P>
   ``A veteran is entitled to the best possible service our country
can give him. We don't need vagrants or convicted felons doing
something with them or within the organization,'' Kirk told the
Globe Friday. ``This is a federal facility. A crook like Fagan,
who's an admitted convicted felon, could not even apply and get a
job there as a volunteer.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're messing around with drugs, with records that are
important, with things that crooks can play with. And he's a known
liar, crook, and all the other bad things we can say about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Fagan could not be reached for comment Friday.
</P>
<P>
   On June 4, a high-ranking Florida corrections official wrote to
Kirk, a West Palm Beach resident, to inform him that a new work
site would be proposed for Fagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This matter has been reviewed with appropriate regional and
local authorities in West Palm Beach, and a suggested change is
being prepared for submission to the Massachusetts court,'' Robert
M. Porter, chief of the Florida bureau of interstate compacts,
wrote Kirk. ``Staff in the office of the Massachusetts commissioner
of probation is also aware of our concerns about this particular
condition and will approach the court.''
</P>
<P>
   However, a spokeswoman for the Massachusetts probation system
said Friday that no correspondence has been received from Florida
on this subject. But if a change of venue for community service is
requested, spokeswoman Coria Holland said, the proposal will be
forwarded to Lauriat for consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan continues to work at the VA medical center near West Palm
Beach, said his Boston attorney, Richard Egbert. ``It strikes me as
pure silliness that anyone would deny to the Veterans
Administration the help of a good, solid volunteer,'' Egbert said.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney lashed out at Kirk, 73, a Republican who served as
Florida governor from 1967-1971. ``Those are the comments of a
self-righteous blowhard who obviously has no understanding of our
system of criminal justice,'' Egbert said. ``This is a
court-ordered community service for a person who can add many
talents as a volunteer and has been happily accepted by the VA.''
</P>
<P>
   The VA medical center in Riviera Beach confirmed that no changes
had been made regarding Fagan, who did volunteer work at the
hospital even before his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Middlesex District Attorney Martha Coakley, whose office
prosecuted Fagan, defended the sentencing agreement. ``This is a
substantial commitment of time and hard work, and it seemed an
appropriate place for him,'' Coakley said. ``This is work that's
needed and productive, we believe. We don't put people to breaking
rocks anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Kirk, however, suggested that Fagan be ordered to work at places
that receive less volunteer help than a VA hospital, such as
homeless shelters, soup kitchens, or wards for babies with AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could be there changing diapers or whatever they do. A
father who took two girls away knows how to change diapers,'' Kirk
said. ``This guy is not guilty in his own mind. What he ought to
say in order to get himself straightened out is: `I did it; I
shouldn't have done it; I should have taken other steps.'
</P>
<P>
   ``But he ain't done it, and he's not going to do it. He's the
ultimate con man. If I had my way, he probably wouldn't even live
in Florida.''
</P>
<P>
   Mulky, the protest organizer who has founded an advocacy group
for abducted children, said she expects the demonstration will last
two hours. The mansion, which Fagan and his fourth wife bought in
1996, has recently been put up for sale for $3.5 million.

 &HT;    Bullock's death brings close to a `great, grand' life
 &HT;    By Patrick Beach and Ken Herman
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Former Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock really was larger
than life. And his death Friday really does mark the end of an era.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Bullock,'' said Gov. George W. Bush, ``was the largest
Texan of our time, as great and grand as the state he loved.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullock, 69, died at his Austin home Friday at 7:05 a.m. after
battling congestive heart failure, lung cancer and a string of
other challenges that might have taken out a smaller Texan years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   A first-generation Texan, Bullock fiercely embraced the state's
colorful history and did more than his part to preserve and
contribute to it. He prodded a major restoration at the State
Cemetery, where he picked his plot several years ago. Bullock also
led the effort to create a state museum, now under construction,
that will bear his name.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock, the name, spoken emphatically, was enough to strike
fear in the hearts of staffers, allies and opponents. Bullock, the
man, rode a basic formula to decades of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``He simply worked harder than anyone else,'' said longtime
Austin political consultant George Christian.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock's temper could melt a brass doorknob, but he was
considerate of his friends. He could be courtly and combative,
gentlemanly and lewd, magnanimous and unforgiving, humble and
intimidating, persuasive and threatening _ all within seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was Vesuvian,'' said Texas Railroad Commissioner Tony
Garza, likening Bullock to a volcano. ``Bullock could summon one's
best angels with his worst temper.''
</P>
<P>
   He also pushed through monumental programs _ changing everything
from the way Texas collects taxes to how it pays for its schools _
and never shied from a little political bloodletting for what he
believed to be in the best interest of Texans.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody was Bullock-proof.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was unpredictable,'' Bush said of Bullock's personality,
``in a charming way. He was a high-energy man. He was
well-prepared. He could be volcanic in his language.
</P>
<P>
   ``And yet beneath the rough-hewn exterior there was a very
loving, decent man,'' Bush concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock's mark on state government will be felt for years to
come, according to Bush, who said ``almost everything about modern
Texas bears his imprint.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, as a result of his willingness in 1995 to cross party
and generational lines to befriend a rookie Republican governor,
Bullock's impact may be felt on the nation for years to come.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when Bush took office, the far-more-experienced
Bullock, who had backed Democrat Ann Richards in her unsuccessful
1994 re-election bid against Bush, could have made the new
governor's life miserable. He didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to put partisanship aside,'' Bush said. ``He wanted
to focus on what's best for Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush had a successful legislative session, putting him on the
course that has led him to front-runner status for the GOP
presidential nomination. Bush and Bullock became close friends.
</P>
<P>
   In his final years, after a lifetime of Democratic loyalty,
Bullock found a Republican to back for president. He endorsed Bush
(over Democrat and longtime Bullock friend Garry Mauro) for
re-election last year and, long before others talked publicly about
it, said he wanted to see Bush in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wept together, and I think that is part of what our tears
were about,'' Bush said of his final meeting with Bullock on
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   During a Wednesday visit, Bush said Bullock wanted to know every
detail of the governor's recent first presidential campaign swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wanted to hear what I saw,'' Bush said. ``He wanted to know
why I didn't smile on the Newsweek cover.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me to go win,'' said Bush, a man who learned that it
could be counterproductive not to do what Bullock wanted you to do.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock was born in Hillsboro in 1929. His father died when
Bullock was a teen-ager. The family moved in with Will Bond, his
elder sister's husband, and it was Bond who first prodded Bullock
to explore politics. He came to the Legislature in 1957 after, he
said, knocking on every door in Hill County twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife in those days wore size six shoes; she did the same
thing,'' Bullock said late last year. ``Amelia Bullock here in town
_ fine lady, she doesn't have much to do with me, but she's a fine
lady _ she did the same thing. Her foot grew to a 7 1/2. I think
that's what she holds against me.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullock finished Baylor law school in 1958, and under a system
in place at the time, got both his law degree from Baylor and his
undergraduate degree that year from Texas Tech University. He quit
the Legislature before his term ended because he couldn't survive
on a legislator's salary. He practiced law in the Rio Grande Valley
and in Tyler, then returned to government for a brief time as
assistant attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   With the 1968 election of Gov. Preston Smith, whose campaign
Bullock helped run, Bullock established a foothold. Smith rewarded
Bullock with a job as appointments secretary, a job at which the
future lieutenant governor joked he was woefully inept, appointing
dead people and convicted felons to important positions.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he did well enough to get promoted to secretary of
state. But his fortunes were still tied to Smith's, and as the
governor was on his way out of office, Bullock found himself in a
crossfire _ Smith tried to get his ally a slot on the state
insurance board, but senators hostile to Smith sank the
appointment. Had the victim been anyone but Bullock, the event
would have been long forgotten. But Bullock never forgot anything,
especially the names of every senator who voted to bust him.
</P>
<P>
   Although defeated for the moment, Bullock soon moved to run for
comptroller of public accounts _ then an obscure pocket of the vast
state bureaucracy that seemed to have last seen substantial change
in the Victorian Era. Bullock had a card file of 40,000 Smith
supporters from which to build his own political base, and he had a
driver, a 24-year-old aide named Mauro.
</P>
<P>
   After winning election in 1974, Bullock knocked down the walls
of his new office building so that his staff could share ideas and
communicate more effectively. Not long after that, ``Bullock's
Raiders'' were knocking down the doors of businesses that were
delinquent in their sales tax payments. The raids, sometimes
conducted with armed men, helped the state's bottom line. And they
were priceless PR for Bullock, whom the press painted more as
latter-day G-man than tax collector. He also sent auditors out of
state to increase Texas' tax collections, and he appointed women
and minorities to important positions within the office.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1992, after a stint as press secretary to Gov. Bill
Clements _ himself a demanding boss _ Reggie Bashur took a similar
post with Bullock. He quit after one day.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be fired by Bullock at least once was seen as an insult.
And those who did their jobs to Bullock's satisfaction had a
lifelong ally and booster.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the Bob Bullock university of public service here in
Austin with hundreds of graduates all throughout state
government,'' Bush said. ``And he was their mentor and their
leader.''
</P>
<P>
   If Comptroller Bullock was gaining a reputation as an autocrat,
he was also growing restless, dismantling and rebuilding parts of
his own organization just to keep busy, and criticizing other state
departments for leaving their lights on. (Bullock, meanwhile, took
heat for staying in $180 a night hotel rooms.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, when he won the lieutenant governor's job _ regarded as
the most powerful elected position in Texas politics _ statehouse
types wondered if Bullock's management style would sit well with
the 31 senators over which he would preside.
</P>
<P>
   He hauled every one of them to the woodshed at one time or
another. The combination of velvet glove and iron fist became known
as The Bullock Treatment or, more famously, the ``drive-by ass
chewing.'' For a senator to get chewed out by Bullock became a rite
of passage, just as getting fired from the comptroller's office had
been. But when it was over, it was truly over _ no hard feelings.
The howling and cussing and threatening was invariably a means,
albeit it crude, to an end.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a management style,'' said Ralph Wayne, a friend for 35
years. ``It was a facade he put up about being mean and rough. He
could take the bark off a cinnamon tree, and at such times it was
best to take your whipping and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his bluster, Bullock knew he needed Republican support
to be an effective leader. And it was Republicans _ chewed behinds
or not _ who uttered some of the most unqualified praise of Bullock
as he prepared to retire in January after eight years in office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a public servant in the highest sense of the word,''
said Sen. David Sibley (R-Waco).
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Teel Bivins (R-Amarillo) went further, naming Bullock one
of the ``three giants of Texas politics in the 20th Century,''
along with icons Lyndon Johnson and U.S. House Speaker Sam Rayburn.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock is survived by his wife, Jan; a son, Robert D. ``Bobby''
Bullock Jr., of Austin; a daughter and her husband, Lindy and Phil
Ward, of Austin; a grandson, Grant Bullock Robinson, of Austin; a
stepdaughter and her husband, Kimberly and Jeff Ader of Houston; a
brother and his wife, Tom and Jane Bullock of Brenham; and several
nieces and nephews.

   WHITE RIVER JUNCTION, Vt. _ On the second floor of a century-old
brick theater building here, the staff at Chelsea Green Publishing
has been puzzling over the phenomenon of ``The Straw Bale House.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, when they first published the guide for building
a home out of straw bales, they expected to sell a few thousand
copies. Now, even though there are only 1,000 or 2,000 such houses
in the nation, sales are nearing 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Chelsea's handbooks for the environmentally concerned are not
just decorating bookshelves in communes. They also appeal to city
dwellers _ armchair farmers who dream of quitting the rat race and
living naturally.
</P>
<P>
   ``They like to dream about growing their own food, preserving
their own food, or they're curious about how to live off the energy
grid in a solar house,'' said Ian Baldwin, who founded the company
with his wife, Margo, in 1984. ``They are people who are inspired
by environmental tales that have a profoundly hopeful side to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Those environmental tales spell profit for Chelsea Green. Since
devoting itself to the art of ``sustainable living'' in 1992, it
has righted its wobbly finances, doubling its sales since 1996 to
more than $2 million. It has gone from publishing four books in
1994 to 26 this year, creating a back list of almost 100 titles
that range from tomes on organic gardening to ``Hemp Horizons,'' a
guide to marijuana's legal cousin by John W. Roulac.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Baldwin knows the city dreamer's mindset well, having lived
in New York for 25 years. While working as a fund-raiser for
nonprofit organizations like the National Audubon Society and the
Environmental Defense Fund, and as a publications director for the
Institute for World Policy, he fed his natural side by bird
watching in Central Park and tending a garden apartment in
Brooklyn. By 1982, his family decided it was time to get out.
</P>
<P>
   They moved to Vermont, and, drawing on Baldwin's experience
working for a large publishing company in the 1960s, scraped
together $115,000 to start their own imprint. The couple looked for
books that appealed to their diverse interests, including nature,
travel and art. Their first book was ``The Man Who Planted Trees,''
by Jean Giono, a fable about a shepherd who devotes his life to
reforesting Provence. Then followed ``Permanent Parisians,'' a
guide to Paris cemeteries by Judi Culbertson and Tom Randall, and a
book on the Norwegian painter Edvard Munch.
</P>
<P>
   While there were successes in the eclectic collection, there
were an equal number of failures. Substantial advances went to
authors for books that were never written. The staff was cut from
11 to 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1991, I came close to trying to sell the company; it was
very bad,'' Baldwin said. ``Those were more difficult years than
any I had in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the company found its niche. Baldwin had brought in Stephen
Morris, a business strategist and fellow Vermonter, as a
consultant. Morris had worked for other environment-friendly
companies, including a wood stove manufacturer, but the
unpredictable world of independent publishing made him scratch his
head.
</P>
<P>
   Morris recalls telling the Baldwins: ``Everything is geared
against the small publisher. I don't even know why you stay in this
business.'' He pointed to their haphazard publishing style and
urged them to focus on one topic. Taking a cue from their own
attempt to simplify their lives, the Baldwins settled on
``sustainable living'' _ existing in a way that does minimal harm
to the planet or other people. Titles would include ``Wind Power
for Home and Business,'' by Paul Gipe; ``Cooking with the Sun,'' by
Beth and Dan Halacy; ``The Soul of Soil,'' by Joe Smillie and Grace
Gershuny; and ``The Good Life,'' Helen and Scott Nearing's book on
self-sufficient living. It was a niche yet to be fully explored by
the book industry.
</P>
<P>
   The tiny publisher embarked on its own sort of sustainable
living, making the most of the resources at hand. In 1993, Morris
set up ``co-publishing'' partnerships with other earth-friendly
businesses. The Real Goods Trading Co., an environmental mail-order
house in California whose catalog reaches millions of people a
year, commissioned the publisher to create a book on wind power,
agreeing to buy a set number of copies. While bookstores are
allowed to return unsold books to publishers, such partnerships
create guaranteed sales for Chelsea Green.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sort of our insurance policy against the whims of the
book business,'' said Morris, who took over the day-to-day
operations as publisher in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In another symbiotic move, Chelsea Green made its authors'
advances more competitive by pursuing grants from foundations. The
Agriculture Department, for example, helped pay the writers' fees
for ``Sharing the Harvest,'' a book on community-supported
agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   It also experimented with all-natural marketing. For Book Expo
America, a conference that attracts thousands of booksellers, Alice
Blackmer, the national sales manager, had the seemingly clever idea
of constructing a display area of straw bales in honor of the new
book. She finally found enough straw in Chicago to build the
display, only to spend frantic hours before the conference dunking
the bales in fire retardant when the fire marshal threatened to
throw them out.
</P>
<P>
   At these conferences, instead of trying desperately to grab a
few minutes with bookstore representatives, Ms. Blackmer passes out
copies of a home-made video that highlights Chelsea Green's newest
releases. It opens with a guitar-playing country Western singer
(a.k.a. Ted Mortimer, the business manager) and his version of the
environmental blues: ``I fell through a hole in the ozone, when I
walked out on you ...''
</P>
<P>
   The increased sales are not just the result of a rush to
self-sufficiency driven by millennium paranoia, although Chelsea
Green does offer ``Y2K and Y-O-U: The Sane Person's
Home-Preparation Guide,'' by Dermot McGuigan and Beverly Jacobson.
Unlike some of the environmental literature of previous decades,
there is little ``doom and gloom'' in the Chelsea Green catalog.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a really good sense of humor here,'' said Jim Schley,
the editor in chief. ``There's a sense that there's some dire news
in the world and that the role that we have to play is in some
cases to be fun pokers and in some cases to be gentle reminders
that sanctimoniousness isn't going to save us either.''
</P>
<P>
   As a former editor of poetry and literature, and a poet himself,
he has a particular ear ``for authors who have an interesting story
to tell,'' he said, even if that story involves composting toilets
or masonry heaters. ``They have a philosophy and a personality that
comes through in the prose.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chelsea Green found four such personalities in David Bainbridge,
David Eisenberg, and Athena Swentzell Steen and her husband, Bill
Steen, all homeowners or builders who have made straw their
crusade. In the ``The Straw Bale House,'' they write that straw, a
popular building material in Nebraska in late-19th century, has
attracted attention in the 1990s because it is readily available,
inexpensive, saves trees, and is an excellent insulator. Color
photographs show a selection of completed homes, their tightly
packed straw walls smoothed over with stucco. These are not grass
huts, but stylish houses adorned with tile floors, French doors and
sun decks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet because of the time and techniques involved, it is not
necessarily less expensive than building a traditional house.
</P>
<P>
   Like any best seller, ``The Straw Bale House'' has its sequels:
``The Rammed Earth House,'' by David Easton, ``The Passive Solar
House,'' by James Kachadorian and, for the truly adventurous, ``The
Earth-Sheltered House,'' by Malcolm Wells, all by evangelists of
innovative shelter.
</P>
<P>
   Some book ideas come from comment cards sent in by readers. A
list on the office wall titled ``Other topics that interest our
readers'' now includes ethnobotany, peace, permafrost, methane
digesters, nomading and animal liberation.
</P>
<P>
   Sustainable living covers many topics, Morris said. ``We can
also publish things that are right out there on the lunatic
fringe.''
</P>
<P>
   But he bristles at the suggestion that the books are feel-good
fantasy. ``This is not Chicken Soup for the Sustainable Soul,'' he
said, alluding to the inspirational books that have made a fortune
for another small publisher, Health Communications. ``These are
mostly practical books that are firmly grounded in reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The hefty straw house book is packed with detailed diagrams of
roof styles and foundations, trenchant discussion of the perils of
humidity and advice on the placement of load-bearing bale walls.
Ms. Blackmer says there are now contractors in California who deal
exclusively in straw bale houses.
</P>
<P>
   The staff frequently turns for professional wisdom to the
company's directors, many of them publishers who look as fondly on
Chelsea Green as farmers over a prize crop of organic soybeans.
George Gibson of Walker &AMP; Company, a New York publisher, said
sticking to its specialty has made Chelsea Green successful. ``When
people look for books in this arena, they look for Chelsea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Entry into this business is very easy _ all you need is a
Xerox machine,'' Gibson said of small publishing. ``Succeeding at
it isn't easy.''
</P>
<P>
   It's too early to tell whether it will follow the path plowed by
62-year-old Rodale Press, whose founder, J.I. Rodale, made
``organic'' a household word with his books and magazines on
gardening. Today, Rodale is a multimedia empire, with books on
well-being accounting for about half of its annual $600 million
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   For now, Chelsea Green finds most of its competition in the
scattered ``sustainable'' books of large publishers and the more
academic offerings of nonprofits.
</P>
<P>
   While some small publishers pin their success on one or two best
sellers, ``with Chelsea Green, what you see is what you get,'' said
Bill Hammond, president of Publishing Strategies International in
Minneapolis, who has been on the board since 1986. ``A novel might
sell well for a month, three months. These books sell well year
after year. Sometimes they sell better in the third year than in
the first.''
</P>
<P>
   So what if all those people aren't building houses out of straw?
As Jim Schley, the editor (and solar-home owner), said, ``Even if
they don't do it, they're more likely to support the issues.'' &QL;

7 RUSSIANS KILLED AND 14 WOUNDED AS FIGHTING BREAKS OUT ALONG
CHECHEN BORDER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia closed all but 10 of its 60 checkpoints along
the Chechnya border Friday after nighttime firefights with Chechen
rebels killed seven Russian policemen and interior ministry troops
and wounded 14 others. The interior ministry said a helicopter
counterattack wiped out a 15-truck convoy carrying perhaps 200
rebels, but it was impossible to verify the report.
</P>
<P>
   The firefights, the worst in several months, occurred along the
borders separating Chechnya from the Dagestan republic on the east
and Stavropol region on the north. The three, all members of the
Russian Federation, have been riven by clan warfare, criminal gangs
and religious strife, much of it centered in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   According to officials in Dagestan, the latest fights began
about 9 p.m. &QL; 
Thursday when Chechen rebels fired shots and mortars at Russian
outposts and barracks near the border between the two regions.
Three interior ministry guards died in the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Mi-24 helicopter gunships joined the attack on the rebels and
the fighting spread along the border before it ended about 4 a.m.
Friday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Residents of a Chechen village near the border said 17 homes
were hit by Russian helicopter rockets and mortar fire, but the
Russian Interior Ministry claimed the fighting never spread across
the Dagestani border.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Chechen rebels attacked a Russian patrol vehicle
Thursday night along the northern border with Stavropol, killing
four Russian policeman. A fifth was still missing on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Chechnya has enjoyed broad autonomy since Russia quit a costly
civil war and withdrew its troops four years ago. But rebels there
still seek independence from Russia and Chechen militants and gangs
have frequently raided neighboring territories.
</P>
<P>
   Violence and crime is so widespread in Chechnya that most
foreigners regard the region as too dangerous to visit, and even
President Boris N. Yeltsin's personal envoy to the region was
kidnapped last year. Russian officials say Chechen gangs still hold
at least 500 Russians hostage, usually for ransom. Since the war
ended, Russia has tried, with mixed results, to keep Chechnya's
chaos from spreading. Some of the 60 border outposts have been
converted into small fortresses, holding as many as five dozen
policemen, armored vehicles and weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has begun a $900,000 project aimed at sealing much of the
border between Chechnya and Stavropol with two ditches, a rampart a
fence and 15 turrets for lookouts.

INTERNATIONAL SALES PUT A DAMPER ON GILLETTE PROFITS FOR 2ND
QUARTER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Germany, Japan, Russia)  By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Gillette Co. has hit a wall even as its core business is
growing.
</P>
<P>
   Reeling from several quarters of disappointing financial
results, it announced this week that more bad news is ahead. By all
appearances, its main business line of blades and razors is doing
well, adding to its leading worldwide market share. But the company
is being dragged down by the weak international performance of some
products, including Braun electric shavers, shaving cream and
stationery.
</P>
<P>
   While its poor foreign results might bode poorly for some other
marketers of consumer products, financial analysts said Gillette's
problems seemed to be more isolated and pointed out that many of
its peers had seen profits in overseas markets improve recently.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Gillette's management warned investors that
second-quarter profits would fall by 20 percent, to about 26 cents
a share, from a year earlier. Wall Street analysts had been
expecting 29 cents, after some previous downward revisions,
according to the First Call Corp., which tracks corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third such warning in four quarters. The latest
shortfall, 10 percent shy of Wall Street forecasts, stunned
investors and even seemed to take management off guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that surprised me more than anything else about this
announcement is that they were surprised,'' Sally Schaadt, an
analyst with Fourteen Research, said. ``I consider them pretty
savvy guys, and they were pretty insistent in April that the rest
of the year would be pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors hoping for a return to the type of earnings growth
that made the stock the bluest of blue chips were slammed.
Gillette's stock tumbled 10.8 percent to $42.187 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette's woes come at a time when it should be frisky. The
company controls 72 percent of the $7 billion worldwide razor and
blade business, which has grown 11 percent in the last 12 months.
Gillette's share has increased 3 percentage points, driven by the
strength of its new three-blade Mach 3 shaving system, which has
captured 13 percent of the total global market since its
introduction in April 1998. The company's Duracell battery unit is
also growing, and its Oral-B dental products remain strong.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's Braun products, which include electric razors
that have been big sellers in Japan, have suffered along with the
Japanese economy. The company's toiletries and stationery sales
have sagged in Germany and Russia where consumer spending is weak.
The strong dollar also has reduced the value of revenues abroad,
making foreign sales less profitable.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, many multinational companies have been hurt by the
collapse of global markets over the last year. Some, like Procter &AMP;
Gamble, continue to struggle, but many of Gillette's peers,
including the Colgate-Palmolive Co. and Avon Products, are growing
abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Gillette faced challenges that would linger well
into the year. For one, Braun's premium pricing makes its products
a tough sell in hard economic times. ``Braun is not an everyday
purchase, so you can certainly defer it,'' William Steele, a
managing director of Banc of America Securities, said.
</P>
<P>
   In the toiletries business, which includes Right Guard deodorant
and Gillette shaving cream, consumers in countries with sluggish
economies have probably been trading down to less expensive brands.
At the same time, the company's stationery business, which includes
Waterman pens, suffered from poor holiday sales as consumers abroad
tightened their budgets; they have not yet opened their purses.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the outside, investors are looking at the Braun,
toiletries and stationery businesses and scratching their heads
wondering how they can be so exasperatingly unprofitable and how
they can be so volatile,'' Constance Meneaty, an analyst with Bear,
Stearns, said.
</P>
<P>
   Some stock analysts are beginning to wonder if Gillette should
simply dump its poorly performing units. ``These are lower-margin,
less-profitable businesses that are not providing any cushion for
the company,'' said Mark Godfrey, an analyst at Invesco funds,
which owns 930,000 Gillette shares. He said he remained bullish on
the company because of the strength of its core franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Gillette this week has sought to reassure investors that its
fundamental business remains strong and that its performance abroad
should begin to improve in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the recovery isn't happening as quickly as we had
projected, I still believe that Gillette's business growth will
accelerate through the last half of 1999, with sales approaching
double-digit growth and earnings improving,'' Michael C. Hawley,
the company's chairman and chief executive, said. He said profits
should return to traditional growth rates of 15 percent to 20
percent, but analysts are left to wonder if once again the company
may be too optimistic.

 &HT;    Bush works to sign or veto bills
 &HT;    By Juan B. Elizondo Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Facing a Sunday deadline, Gov. George W. Bush
was expected to work through the weekend to finish reviewing,
signing and vetoing the more than 1,600 bills that lawmakers sent
to him this year.
</P>
<P>
   Bush held a public ceremony Friday to sign two bills he has
sought, one to restructure the state's electricity industry and the
other to put tighter clamps on air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   The electricity bill, Senate Bill 7, will restructure the entire
industry and, by 2002, deregulate the system by which most Texans
get power at their homes and businesses. Under the current system,
Texans buy their power from particular companies based on where
they live.
</P>
<P>
   Under Senate Bill 7, electricity companies will have to compete
to sell power to Texans regardless of where they live. The bill
also contains measures to reduce air pollution from power plants.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Bill 766 encourages owners of industrial plants that were
built before modern air pollution laws to bring those plants up to
snuff with current pollution standards. It contains hefty fines for
the largest polluters that don't go along with the voluntary plan.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who pushed for the voluntary program without the fines,
said he's happy with the final product and believes it will
``result in cleaner air in communities across the state.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased that the legislation contains additional
incentives for companies to clean up sooner,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday afternoon, Bush had signed more than 400 of the
bills lawmakers approved during this year's session. It ended May
31.
</P>
<P>
   By law, Bush has until Sunday to sign or veto the bills. Those
that don't get action from the governor become law without his
signature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't made up my mind,'' Bush said Friday. ``You can ask
me about bill number so-and-so and so-and-so, and I will give you
the same answer on each of them: I will not finish the process
until probably Sunday and I will put out the veto messages at that
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the bills that Bush already has signed are $506 million in
tax breaks for Texas corporations and consumers and $3.8 billion in
new education spending. Those bills include business breaks for
research and development spending, sales tax exemptions for all
over the counter medicines, about $1.3 billion in property tax
breaks and $1.7 billion for teacher salary increases.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday afternoon, Bush has vetoed only two bills.
</P>
<P>
   House Bill 64, sponsored by Rep. Sherri Greenberg (D-Austin),
would have provided grants to encourage business loans for small
businesses and those owned by minorities in poorer areas of Texas.
Bush said lawmakers didn't set aside money for the program.
</P>
<P>
   House Bill 2107, the other bill Bush vetoed, would have raised
sales taxes on fireworks in order to provide more money to
volunteer fire departments. Bush said the proposed tax hike would
push the rate above the constitutional limit of 8.25 percent and
would duplicate a separate fire prevention program that the
Commission on Fire Protection already runs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokeswoman Linda Edwards said while there's a crush of
bills awaiting the governor's signature, his staff has been working
on them all year and knows what needs to be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every bill is reviewed by general counsel, the budget office,
policy office, legislative office and executive office. There are
some people that have have several feet-high stacks of bills
covering desks and tables,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   She added, however, that many of the bills easily clear the
review process and take less time than those that face questions or
concerns. Edwards also said Bush staffers have been tracking
legislation all year and aren't completely overwhelmed by the
onslaught.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been looking at legislation as soon as legislation is
filed,'' Edwards said.
</P>
<P>
   But while the policy and legal decision-making isn't overly
taxing, Edwards said there is the physical aspect of signing bills.
</P>
<P>
   By law, there's one official copy of each bill lawmakers passed.
That's the bill that Bush must sign and must be tracked carefully
as it moves through the process. That bill is filed with the
Secretary of State's office after its signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a couple of people . . . simply involved in the
technical and physical aspects of the process who are working very
long hours,'' Edwards said. ``They know what to expect and are used
to it.''

   FRANCE: EX-OFFICIAL TIED TO AIDS SCANDAL
</P>
<P>
   Former Health Minister Claude Evin was put under investigation
for suspected manslaughter, the latest politician to be linked to a
scandal involving deaths due to AIDS-infected blood. Former Prime
Minister Laurent Fabius and one of his ministers were acquitted
this year of responsibility in allowing the use of unscreened blood
for hemophiliacs in the 1980s. A third official was convicted but
not jailed, a decision that angered many relatives of the 3,600
infected people, of whom close to 1,000 have died.

   NORTHERN IRELAND: SHOOTING INQUIRY URGED
</P>
<P>
   David Trimble, the Protestant first minister of the Northern
Ireland Assembly, called on the British government to investigate
the shooting of a former IRA official to determine if the attack
was made by the IRA. A finding involving the group would give
Protestant leaders grounds for excluding its political wing, Sinn
Fein, from the Assembly, causing a serious disruption of the peace
effort. Martin McGartland, who informed on the IRA, was shot and
wounded at his home in England.

   SWITZERLAND: BLOW TO HOLOCAUST FUND
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers dealt a blow to the government's plan to set up a fund
to help the needy, including Holocaust victims, by rejecting a

US AGREES TO GIVE RUSSIA PEACEKEEPING ROLE IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOGNE, Germany _ Removing a major obstacle to the
international peacekeeping force in Kosovo, the United States and
Russia agreed to give Russian peacekeepers a major role, but not
sole control over any single sector of the province.
</P>
<P>
   The pact ends a weeklong diplomatic standoff that began when 200
Russian troops surprised NATO by taking up positions at the airport
near the Kosovo capital of Pristina after Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic began withdrawing his forces from Kosovo as part
of a NATO peackeeping plan.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement followed a day in which NATO faced several
challenges from within the province, including:
</P>
<P>
   _The detention by NATO peacekeepers of 25 members of the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army after NATO's rescue of 15 battered Gypsies
and ethnic Albanians from what may have been a KLA torture chamber
for alleged collaborators.
</P>
<P>
   _The continued influx of ethnic Albanian refugees, despite the
threat of land mines. At least 50,000 refugees have already
returned to Kosovo, the UN refugee agency says.
</P>
<P>
   _The outflow of ethnic Serbs from the province, despite new
appeals to stay by the leader of the Serbian Orthodox Church. Up to
50,000 Serb civilians have already left and the rest are
increasingly fearful as Serb troops pulled out of central Kosovo
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Under the US-Russian peacekeeping plan, Russian troops will
serve within sections of Kosovo controlled by peacekeeping forces
from the United States, France and Germany. Their commanders will
report to officials from those three countries.
</P>
<P>
   NATO will maintain air-traffic control of the airport near
Pristina, which is in the British section, but the Russians will
have other responsiblities at the airport, such as space allocation
and public works, US officials here said. Russians will constitute
no more than 3,600 of the 50,000 troops that will control the
province under the NATO-led effort.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, who is here for an economic summit with heads
of leading industrial nations, applauded the agreement, saying it
provides ``a significant range of responsibilites for the Russians,
which I think are entirely appropriate and will enhance the
mission's effectiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I am fully supportive of this agreement and very
pleased by it. This has been a good day.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan was hashed out during three days of talks in Helsinki,
Finland between Defense Secretary William Cohen and Russian Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev. Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright
and Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov became involved in the
sessions Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations had encountered many twists and turns, and
although US officials had remained optimistic that an accord could
be reached, Clinton suggested at one point Friday that the issue
might not be settled before Sunday, when he is scheduled to meet
here with Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement recognizes the stakes that Russia and NATO
share in Europe's future,'' Cohen said. ``It also shows that the
United States and Russia can work together on important security
issues. As major powers, we share a responsibility to work together
for peace and stability, and we have shown that we can measure up
to and meet that responsibility,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev called the agreement ``an alternative solution'' that
will allow Russia to participate in Kosovo peacekeeping and
``ensure that cooperation with our neighbors is effective in the
interest in implementing the common task.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and Albright were to head for Brussels Saturday to brief
NATO allies on the details of the plan, which is expected to be
approved by its North Atlantic Council.
</P>
<P>
   A major stumbling block had been NATO's demand _ resisted by
Russia _ that all countries participating in peacekeeping in Kosovo
operate under a single NATO-led command. Russia also desired its
own geographic ``zone of responsibility'' within a section of
Kosovo. US officials opposed that, fearing it would amount to a
partitioning of Kosovo, because of the Russians' close ties to the
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We said in the beginning that we wanted the Russians to
participate'' in the peacekeeping effort, said a senior US
official. ``We think it will be stronger and better for it; but
this could only take place under an arrangement which provided for
the NATO-led operation with unity of command and did not in any way
undermine the effectiveness of the force.''
</P>
<P>
   The official added, ``We believe these requirements are met:
There is no Russian sector, there's no partition here.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said it was important that the Russians play an active
role in peacekeeping effort because of their links to the Serbs. He
has repeatedly said that NATO bore no grudges against the Serbian
people, and had not taken sides in their conflict with ethnic
Albanians in the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will help us to send the message, to model the message, to
both groups that we really do want all law-abiding people to be
able to live in peace in Kosovo, and we intend to honor our
commitments to that end,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Russian's unpredictability, Clinton suggested that
he trusted they would follow through on the agreement. ``All I can
tell you is, every time I've had an understanding with Boris
Yeltsin he's kept it.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, US officials said it was Yeltsin who suggested the two
defense secretaries get together in Helsinki for the talks after
the early Russian troop move into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Those negotiations had dominated the first day of the three-day
economic summit here, including a working dinner Friday night,
along with discussions on rebuilding Kosovo and its neighbors in
southeastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   US National Security Adviser Samuel R. ``Sandy'' Berger said the
leaders have agreed to hold a ``donor's conference'' possibly in
the next several weeks that would address Kosovo's short-term
needs. They have also begun discussing, at least conceptually, a
plan for rebuilding Kosovo and its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he believes Europe should carry the bulk of the
cost of rebuilding southeastern Europe, but that the International
Monetary Fund and the World Bank ``should do a lot of it'' and the
``United States should contribute.''
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair said he agreed entirely with
Clinton on the shouldering of the cost. ``We acknowledge our
responsibility in relation to reconstruction. There's a different
set of balances in relation to the cost of the troops that are
going in now, and you've got to look at everything in the round,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We can debate about the cost, and balance it out in
terms of the overall military campaign _ how we deliver the proper
administration in Kosovo, how we then reconstruct the Balkans. But
the key thing about this is our determination to make sure that
reconstruction actually happens.''

 &HT;    G-7 AGREES TO $90 BILLION DEBT RELIEF PACKAGE FOR POORER NATIONS
 &HT;    400&AMP;ADD.
 &HT;    With G8-KOSOVO-0619.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOGNE, Germany _ Tossing a lifeline to poor countries awash in
a sea of debt, leaders from seven of the world's wealthiest nations
called Friday for a program aimed at wiping out up to $90 billion
worth of unpaid loans.
</P>
<P>
   The money would be available only to those countries that pledge
to use the savings from reduced debt payments to improve the health
and education of their poorest inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be writing off literally billions of dollars worth of
debt,'' said British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who joined
President Clinton and five other world leaders here for the annual
summit of the heads of state of the so-called Group of Seven, or
G-7, industrial powers. ``I believe this summit will mark,
probably, the single biggest step forward in debt relief and help
for the poorest countries that we've seen in the international
community for many years.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the G-7 set up a pool, now worth $13 billion,
of money that would be available for debt reduction to poor
indebted countries meeting certain criteria.
</P>
<P>
   Under the existing program, 26 countries -- most of whose people
scrape by on the local equivalent of a dollar a day or less -- are
eligible for the relief.
</P>
<P>
   The G-7 leaders agreed Friday to expand that program to take in
a total of 33 needy countries that together owe wealthy nations a
staggering $127 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The G-7 plan also calls for member states to add up to $37
billion to the existing pool, making as much as $50 billion in
direct debt relief available to qualifying countries.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the G-7 leaders called on member states -- the
United States, Britain, Canada, France, Germany, Italy and Japan --
to collectively forgive up to $20 billion in debts owed through
concessionary foreign assistance loans.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the G-7 urged other industrial powers not belonging to
the prestigious club to chip in with another $20 billion worth of
debt relief.
</P>
<P>
   Indebtedness is a leading impediment to development among dozens
of the world's poorest countries, many of which are forced to pay
up to 30 cents on every dollar of government revenue simply to make
payments on debts owed to wealthy nations.
</P>
<P>
   Those commitments leave impoverished nations too strapped to
adequately address legitimate development needs ranging from
education to the prevention of AIDS, a chronic malady that
threatens tens of millions of people across the continent of Africa
alone.

GUN CONTROL BILL, SEEN AS BOTH TOO WEAK AND TOO TOUGH, DEFEATED IN
HOUSE

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House on Friday concluded a bitter,
wide-ranging debate over the seeds of violence among American
children by rejecting, 280 to 147, a package of new restrictions on
firearms that was significantly weaker than legislation approved by
the Senate last month.
</P>
<P>
   An odd coalition of liberal Democrats, moderate Republicans and
conservative opponents of gun control in both parties banded
together to defeat the House measures, which struck many lawmakers
as too little and many others as too much. In the end, 82
Republicans joined with 197 Democrats and one independent in
opposition to the legislation, while only 10 Democrats sided with
137 Republicans in favor of it.
</P>
<P>
   That outcome seriously clouded the prospects for the passage of
modest new gun-control measures in Congress this year and brought
to a close _ at least for now _ the long, intense weeks of
political wrangling and legislative soul-searching touched off by
the massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., on April
20.
</P>
<P>
   A House juvenile crime bill that was passed on Thursday, before
the companion legislation on gun control was considered, will
proceed to a conference committee to be reconciled with a Senate
juvenile crime bill that comprised an array of modest new
restrictions on firearms.
</P>
<P>
   But that could be many weeks away, and the absence of gun
control in the House version makes it unclear how much, if any, of
the Senate measures will survive. House Democrats vowed to push
their cause in other ways and perhaps use parliamentary maneuvers
to bring back to the House floor stronger gun-control provisions
than the ones they opposed today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll use every method we can,'' said Rep. Dick Gephardt of
Missouri, the Democratic minority leader.
</P>
<P>
   The House has traditionally proven more resistant to gun control
than the Senate, but Friday's defeat also reflected the
relentlessly building war between Republicans and Democrats as they
head into the 2000 elections, when control of the House as well as
the White House is up for grabs. The political calculations of each
party helped to doom any kind of consensus, and the finger pointing
began almost instantly after the final vote.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said that they had succeeded in blocking and exposing
a Republican deception of progress that, in fact, relaxed a number
of aspects of current gun-control law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House leadership gutted this bill in the dark of night,''
President Clinton said Friday, referring to a vote at midnight
Thursday for the most lenient of several proposals to regulate the
sale of firearms at gun shows. It was the passage of this measure,
supported by House Republican leaders and the National Rifle
Association, that stirred such solid Democratic opposition to the
final gun-control bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our nation is waiting for Washington to pass a real law that
keeps guns away from children and out of the hands of children,''
Clinton said. ``I call on Congress to stop playing politics and
start living up to its responsibility to save lives.''
</P>
<P>
   But House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, an Illinois Republican,
accused Democrats of the same games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let there be no mistake,'' said Hastert, who did not join
other Republican leaders at a news conference following the vote,
in a written statement. ``The vast majority of the Democratic
caucus walked away when they had the chance to walk forward for the
good of the country.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' opposition to the bill stemmed from the stinging
defeat, around 1 a.m. Friday, of a measure sponsored by Rep.
Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., to require mandatory background checks on
all buyers at gun shows. Mrs. McCarthy's measure, which largely
mirrored the Senate legislation, defined gun shows broadly and gave
vendors up to three business days to conduct those checks.
</P>
<P>
   But the House defeated it only an hour after narrowly approving
a rival gun-show measure that was sponsored by Rep. John D.
Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, that relaxed current law in some
ways. Dingell formerly served on the board of the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   His measure, like Mrs. McCarthy's, obliged the 40 percent of
vendors at gun shows who are hobbyists or collectors to conduct the
kinds of background checks that only the 60 percent of sellers who
are licensed dealers must now perform. But it gave both these
groups only 24 hours before the sale would be allowed to go
through. Licensed dealers currently have three business days.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   All the Republican leaders in the House voted with Dingell, and
in the minutes between his victory and Mrs. McCarthy's defeat,
which was all but certain at that point, she choked back tears as
she addressed her colleagues from the well of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McCarthy, whose husband was killed and her son critically
injured by a gunman on the Long Island Rail Road in 1993, said, ``I
made a promise to my son and to my husband.'' The nature of that
vow was implicit as she added, ``If there was anything that I could
do to prevent one family from going through what I have gone
through and every other victim that I know have gone through, then
I have done my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McCarthy drew a standing ovation, even from many of the
Republicans and conservative Democrats who then voted against her
proposal, which was defeated, 253 to 193. Dingell's measure had
passed by a vote of 218 to 211.

   DINGJIAERGOU, China _ In Ding Yaohong's tiny sitting room, mud
walls are etched with deep cracks and two tattered chairs vie for
space with roosting chickens, signs of this remote region's
desperate poverty. But the new centerpiece of the room, displacing
a small, rotting table, is the spine of an ancient spade-toothed
elephant _ recently unearthed evidence that Ding's hard homeland
may have some wealth to offer after all.

   For years, the farmers here struggled to coax wheat and corn to
grow on these arid, rocky hills, but the land gave little in
return. ``Plant a handful of seed and you get a handful of crops,''
a local saying goes.
</P>
<P>
   But recently this barren, brown wasteland has yielded a
lucrative new crop that stands to repay the generations of
suffering: a cache of nearly intact 15 million-year-old fossils,
which the villagers plan to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been digging for fossils for more than 10 years, but
this is the first time we've hit upon anything like this,'' Ding
said.
</P>
<P>
   His home is now littered with valuable specimens excavated in
the last two months, including prehistoric crocodiles, rhinos and
pigs. ``When the experts come to buy, I hope it will be a very good
harvest,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As China has moved toward a market economy, peasants all over
rural China have had to devise ways to buy goods and services that
were once provided for free by the state, like education and
medicine. Where land is good they farm. Near cities, they turn to
migrant labor.
</P>
<P>
   But the village of Dingjiaergou, whose residents belong to
China's Hui Muslim minority (and are mostly surnamed Ding), is 15
miles from the nearest paved road. It is six hours by car from
Yinchuan, the sleepy provincial capital of the Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region, one of the poorest in China, with a per capita
income of less than $100 a year. The village got electricity
several years ago, but houses still lack running water, phones or
heat, even though winter temperatures drop well below zero.
</P>
<P>
   So peasants here have turned to large-scale fossil excavation to
make ends meet _ a unique if dangerous (and illegal) sideline.
</P>
<P>
   When not tending their crops, the men of Dingjiaergou can often
be found tunneling like groundhogs 10 feet under the region's
hills, in the hopes of finding ancient bones.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago Ding and 17 other villagers hit gold. They
burrowed their way into the underground cache. Now, the three-room
mud-brick house he shares with his wife and three children
resembles a museum storeroom, with the spine in the sitting room,
piles of skulls in the bedroom, and the huge-tusked skull of a
spade-toothed elephant blocking access to the family kang, a
traditional brick bed built over an oven to provide winter warmth.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have long known that this arid land in Tongxin County
was once a richly forested terrain, filled with lakes and rivers,
said Ye Jie, deputy director of the Institute of Vertebrate
Paleontology at the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s and '70s some farmers picked up spare cash by
digging up and selling ``dragon bones'' _ fossil shards used to
make traditional medicines for treating stomach troubles and scars.
In the next two decades, Chinese scientists occasionally made
research expeditions to this remote region, cataloguing its past.
</P>
<P>
   But farmers here say they only recently realized that there was
big money in excavations, and began carving out their peculiar
niche in China's emerging market economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning, we didn't know how valuable this stuff
was,'' said Ding Yuzhu, a grizzled 50-year-old in a Mao jacket and
white skullcap.
</P>
<P>
   He said that in the last few years, Chinese scientists as well
as foreign experts had come to view _ and buy _ their wares. ``Now
we have discovered we could do this to make a living,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ding Yaohong, a burly man of 38, said that even before the major
discovery this spring, most of his income in recent years had come
from fossils. He makes about $35 a year from growing wheat and corn
_ and $125 a month selling the smaller fossils and bone shards he
unearthed in the past.
</P>
<P>
   With this year's jackpot, his second income stands to increase
many times. He and his partners say they will price the elephant
skull alone at $4,000 to $6,000. Ding says they plan to sell the
fossils to the Natural History Museum in Beijing, but experts
predict that many will end up on a lucrative black market.
</P>
<P>
   Neither farmers nor local officials seem terribly perturbed that
their digging is technically illegal. ``In fact we don't have much
choice,'' the older Ding said, ``since our land is so poor we would
starve otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   The officials have done little to intervene, noting that the
region's government does not have the money for proper excavation
anyhow.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many scientists are concerned that these amateur fossil
hunters may be destroying valuable scientific evidence with their
rudimentary picks and shovels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most scientists are opposed to this unscientific digging, even
though it has been a convenient way to get specimens,'' said Ye of
the Academy of Sciences. ``The peasants' goal is to sell fossils _
not to gather related scientific information _ so things are lost.
And because of their limited knowledge they often damage valuable
things which they think of as unimportant.''
</P>
<P>
   To get to the fossils, groups of villagers first dig a hole down
several yards into the earth, and then often tunnel laterally
hundreds of yards.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, the 18-man team from Dingjiaergou tunneled 500
yards before they found fossils, which Ding said could be
distinguished from the surrounding rocks by their color and also
their unique taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found so many things there,'' he said, ``but it was hard
since the tunnel was only 1.5 yards high _ you couldn't stand up
and only one person could go in at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Each fossil had to be dragged out of the narrow tunnel using
ropes. And scientists complain that the villagers inevitably chop
up large specimens to get them up through their maze, destroying
evidence in the process.
</P>
<P>
   It is a dangerous after-hours job that has killed two men from
Dingjiaergou in the last 10 years. Since there are no trees in this
desertlike region, tunnels are not reinforced by root networks and
are thus prone to collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is our first big find after years of looking,'' the elder
Ding said, ``and two people have died doing it. That's why the
bones are so expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   The villagers say that over the last few years, visiting experts
have taught them how to handle the fossils more carefully and
brought scientific charts that help them identify bones from
ancient mammals.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the fossils remain inscrutable to the peasants.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's that?'' a visitor asked, pointing to a pear-shaped
15-inch skull on the dirt floor, with dull yellow teeth protruding
at odd angles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh that, that's some kind of monster,'' the elder Ding said
with assurance.

DESPITE THE FEARS, INFLATION STILL REFUSES TO MATERIALIZE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 20) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y.)   (af)  
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is inflation rising in America? No, it is not. Just look at the
numbers. Is it about to start rising? That depends on whom you talk
to. Wall Street forecasters worry that it soon will, that America
is still inflation-prone. But talk to the people who compile the
monthly inflation numbers. They are singularly unconcerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the last couple of years, we have had the best inflation
picture _ the lowest inflation rate _ since the first half of the
1960s, and there is no evidence of any change coming in that
situation,'' said Patrick Jackman, chief of the division at the
Bureau of Labor Statistics that puts together the Consumer Price
Index.
</P>
<P>
   The index jumped 0.7 percent in April _ scaring Wall Street but
not the public, according to the University of Michigan's weekly
consumer surveys _ and then fell back to a zero increase in May.
All of the odd circumstances that pushed inflation up in April
disappeared in May. And the June data collected so far by Jackman's
people suggest that inflation this month will turn out to be
similarly mild.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only concern for June lies in higher fruit and vegetable
prices because of a drought in many parts of the country,'' Jackman
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, made a
similarly sanguine prediction last Thursday, the day after the May
CPI figure was released. ``For the period immediately ahead,''
Greenspan told Congress, ``inflationary pressures still seem well
contained.''
</P>
<P>
   So why all the hand-wringing? Why all the talk of raising
interest rates to head off inflation, when the inflation rate is
not rising and shows no sign of starting to do so?
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of reasons are offered, of course: tight labor markets,
strong economic growth, an overexuberant stock market, incipient
recoveries elsewhere in the world and that old standby, mothballed
for months: a need to strike pre-emptively to minimize a future
inflationary surge.
</P>
<P>
   ``A stitch in time saves nine,'' said William Dudley, director
of domestic economic research at Goldman Sachs, invoking a favorite
Wall Street metaphor to justify a pre-emptive rate increase by the
Federal Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely in recent years, however, has inflation seemed less
threatening. Consider the April surge. Gasoline prices accounted
for half the reported increase, and they rose mainly in response to
fears that the oil-producing countries would cut back production.
But the expected shortages have not materialized. Gasoline prices
rose only slightly in May, and initial surveys show that they have
fallen in June, Jackman said.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the April rise in the CPI _ the only significant
increase in months _ came mainly in prices of tobacco, apparel and
hotel lodging. Cigarette makers discounted prices in March and then
removed the discounts in April, a standard off-and-on marketing
practice.
</P>
<P>
   In apparel, an early Easter brought discounts in March and a
rebound to standard prices in April. Women's clothes were
discounted in May, Jackman said, and men's clothing prices are
usually cut after Father's Day. ``July, you are discounting
everything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Seasonal adjustments were largely responsible for the lodging
spike. Jackman's people generally expect hotel and resort rates to
fall in April, as the winter vacation season ends, and to rise
again in June for the summer season; these expectations are built
into the CPI pricing formula. But the industry is pushing on-season
and off-season prices closer together. Until the old formula can be
updated, it will produce artificial price ``changes'' in some
months.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes. Are there shortages of goods or services, given
the strong consumer demand? Not at all, the data indicate. Are
prices rising for imports, a big source of inexpensive goods? No.
Excluding oil, import prices fell significantly in the first five
months of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Take another tack. Argue that the CPI cannot continue to rise so
slowly _ at an annual rate of only 2.1 percent through May _ when
the economy is growing so strongly. But here, too, illusion plays a
role.
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau of Labor Statistics has been making its method of
calculating the index more accurate and applying it to figures
dating back to 1995. When and if the improvements are extended
further back, annual inflation in earlier years will be revised
downward by 0.4 percentage points, according to an article, soon to
be published, by two of Jackman's staff economists.
</P>
<P>
   So the fall in inflation since 1995 isn't as sharp as the
unadjusted figures now make it appear. If the inflation rate were
measured in the old pre-1995 way, it would be closer to 3 percent,
said Alan Blinder, a Princeton economist, and we would say
inflation has been stable since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Since the inflation rate is used to determine the nation's
economic growth rate, the perspective has to be fixed there, too.
When that happens, today's growth will not seem so strong relative
to the past.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a small rate increase when the Fed's policymakers meet on
June 29 and 30 may well be good strategy for other reasons, like
calming nerves, or taking some of the bubble out of stock prices,
or satisfying expectations on Wall Street. But invoking inflation _
even not-so-imminent inflation _ as justification for a rate
increase does not wash.

 &HT;    Restored Delta plane flies original route to celebrate 70 years
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSON, Miss. _ Big corporations often celebrate birthdays by
recalling their humble origins.
</P>
<P>
   At Delta Air Lines this week, a group of pilots and mechanics
went a step further, faithfully re-creating those origins for what
amounted to a barnstorming history tour across the South.
</P>
<P>
   They marked the 70th anniversary of Delta's first day of airline
service by flying a single-engine, five-passenger Travel Air along
the carrier's original route.
</P>
<P>
   Just after 8 a.m. on June 17, 1929, a Travel Air belonging to
what was then called Delta Air Service lifted off a dirt runway at
Dallas' Love Field on a hopscotch flight to Jackson, Miss., via
Shreveport and Monroe, La.
</P>
<P>
   Pilot Johnny Howe was alone at the controls. Delta's first three
passengers, their names lost to time, sat on wicker chairs behind
him in the Travel Air's boxy, cramped fuselage.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, 70 years later almost to the minute, a
restored Delta Travel Air taxied past huge modern jets to the end
of a vast cement runway at Love Field.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots Ted Abbott, retired from Delta, and Robin Maiden, who
usually flies 757s for a living, drew a verbal double-take from a
controller when they radioed for takeoff permission.
</P>
<P>
   ``What kind of aircraft are you again?'' the perplexed
controller asked before granting clearance.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Abbott applied full throttle, and the craft
eagerly bounded down the runway and into the air in less than 400
feet, a fraction of the space needed by a modern jet.
</P>
<P>
   Delta mechanics who helped restore the plane rode along on the
daylong sentimental journey, as did an Atlanta Journal-Constitution
reporter and a Delta public relations officer dispatched to handle
the small crowds that turned out at each stop.
</P>
<P>
   Other pilots and mechanics traveled in a vintage DC-3 that flew
along as a support plane. On Friday, the Travel Air flew back to
Atlanta, where it's kept and maintained as part of Delta's Air
Transport Heritage Museum project.
</P>
<P>
   The trip offered both a vivid glimpse into Delta's beginnings
and testimony to the astonishing progress made in commercial
aviation during this century.
</P>
<P>
   The first Dallas-Jackson flight took about five hours, and cost
$90 round-trip _ nearly $800 in today's dollars. Then as now,
passengers were buying time. The 1929 service shaved 12 hours off
the time required by ground transport, which a Delta marketing
pamphlet declared ``too slow to meet the needs of a new epoch in
human affairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, the 400-mile flight takes about an hour nonstop on a
Delta jet and costs between $170 and $310. Passengers are
transported in fast, quiet aluminum cocoons with scarcely any
awareness of the miracle of flight or their precarious position in
space. No such blissful ignorance was allowed in 1929.
</P>
<P>
   Powered by a nine-cylinder radial engine, the Travel Air was a
sturdy and well-built plane, heralded in its day as ``the last word
in airplane construction'' and the ``limousine of the skies.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, on Thursday's flight the little plane bobbed on
each fresh air current as Abbott and Maiden steered it eastward
beyond the Dallas sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers sat behind them in narrow seats _ mercifully padded
during Delta's restoration _ with an open view of the rudimentary
cockpit and the exposed cylinder heads beyond the front windshield.
</P>
<P>
   The Travel Air's wide, tall side windows afforded panoramic
views as the plane cruised at about 90 mph over the countryside
3,000 or so feet below.
</P>
<P>
   Delta's restored plane has earphones so that occupants can speak
to each other; without them, the din from the engine and the
airflow made shouting or hand gestures the only practical form of
communication. Early passengers stuffed cotton in their ears.
</P>
<P>
   After an initial indulgence in air traffic control guidance _
which didn't exist in 1929 _ Abbott and Maiden resorted to
old-fashioned navigation techniques as the plane churned just
beneath a low cloud layer toward Shreveport.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, we're looking for a big lake,'' said Maiden, consulting a
chart and peering out the windscreen at the ground 2,500 feet
below. Addison should be up here on the left.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times in the early days when the pilots did get
lost,'' Abbott noted cheerfully. ``They'd just land at a strip or
in a field and ask where they were.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Delta's early route maps advertised numerous ``emergency
landing strips'' along with the intended destinations, as if to
reassure customers there really was a plan B if the weather soured
or the engine conked out.
</P>
<P>
   No such excitement occurred on Thursday's flight, although
Abbott and Maiden once resorted to circling a small town water
tower _ ``Ringgold,'' (La.) it announced _ to get their bearings.
</P>
<P>
   At another point, Maiden decided it was time to clean a few oil
droplets off the front windshield _ a normal by-product of radial
engine operation, he assured. He grabbed a rag, rolled down his
window and reached around to wipe away the oil.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours into Thursday's trip, Shreveport's airport came into
view and Abbott brought the Travel Air down to a butter-smooth
landing using a fraction of the runway. On final approach, the
Travel Air passed a taxiing Delta MD-88, whose captain opened his
window to wave.
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, a few dozen Delta employees, local aviation buffs
and airport officials gaped at the antique plane as it taxied to
the ramp and the engine wheezed to a stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this anything like Lindbergh's plane?'' 78-year-old
Shreveport resident Will McNutt asked the pilots. He recalled his
own first ride on a similar-looking plane in 1928.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pilot gave me a little card saying I'd been on an
airplane,'' he said. ``It was a big thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gassed up and topped off with a couple of quarts of oil by Delta
mechanics Bill Tinsley and Jeff Hoole, the plane left Shreveport
about 12:30 p.m., the skies now clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a nice day for an inaugural flight,'' remarked Abbott,
now navigating while Maiden handled the controls. ``The Gods are
smiling on Delta Air Service today.''
</P>
<P>
   An hour and numerous lakes and small towns later, the plane
crossed the Ouchita River near Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Home office is dead ahead,'' said Abbott as Maiden zeroed in
on the Monroe airport. Delta was a Monroe-based crop dusting
service before becoming an airline, and it didn't move its
headquarters to Atlanta until 1941.
</P>
<P>
   Maiden brought the plane down to within a few feet of the runway
and then back up and around the airfield for the assembled crowd.
After he landed, a convoy of emergency trucks tailed the Travel Air
to the terminal and gave it another waterspray salute.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Monroe greeters was Henry Biedenharn III, who sits on
Delta's board of directors. His family helped bankroll Delta in the
early days and has had a seat on the board ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it just shows that as large and complex a company
Delta has become, it's not too big to return to its roots and
beginnings,'' Biedenharn said.
</P>
<P>
   Just after 2 p.m. the plane churned skyward once more for the
final leg to Jackson. Jake Boyd, another retired Delta pilot, now
took a turn at the controls with Maiden as co-pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Soon the Mississippi River came into view as a broad,
brown-green band on the hazy horizon. Its enormity was far more
impressive at 2,000 feet _ the Travel Air's altitude as it passed
near Vicksburg _ than from 30,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Travel Air touched down in Jackson about 3:15 p.m.,
passengers and pilots alike by now sweaty and tired from the
daylong noise, heat and vibration.
</P>
<P>
   Maiden managed a moment of reflection.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fun and we had a good time,'' he said. ``But I had a
few quiet moments up there, thinking, `Here are the same fields
(Howe) saw, here's the same river he saw, the same railroads.' It
does makes you appreciate what came before.''

LET'S HEAR IT FOR THE MR. MOMS OF THE ANIMAL KINGDOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By M.L. LYKE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Your Homo sapiens dad's a real stand-up guy.
</P>
<P>
   But would he roll you up in a dung ball for protection?
</P>
<P>
   Would he undergo wrenching contractions to give birth to you and
a couple hundred siblings?
</P>
<P>
   Would he sacrifice food for a significant chunk of his limited
life span to carry you through incubation _ then stifle a gnawing
urge to eat you?
</P>
<P>
   Raise those fins and claws and pointy little talons and give it
up for the Mr. Moms of the animal kingdom, those hard-working,
overlooked Superdads who do twice the work and get half the credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always hear about the mothers, not the fathers,'' says
Holly Reed, associate veterinarian at Point Defiance Zoo and
Aquarium in Tacoma. ``The male has a major role in a number of
obscure species.''
</P>
<P>
   This oversight is understandable. Earth moms are easy. Most coo
and cuddle, lick and suckle, nest and nurture.
</P>
<P>
   Their mates present a more complicated picture. There are
deadbeat dads who breed-and-run. And worse.
</P>
<P>
   Sea lion dads have a nasty tendency to roll over and squish
young pups. Roaringly hungry Daddie Dearest bears have been known
to make quick meals of small cubs. And alligators, although gentle
lovers and faithful mates, will _ given half a chance _ dine on the
tasty eggs containing their young.
</P>
<P>
   But animal dads can be endearingly tender.
</P>
<P>
   One beguiling papa is the pint-size Golden Lion tamarin, a
miniature Chewbacca with a coat the color of honey. Several weeks
after mom gives birth, the little fellow takes over, carrying his
gold children nestled in the silky fur of his back.
</P>
<P>
   Even when they're big kids, the tamarins rely on dad. ``When
they get scared, they will still jump back on him,'' says zookeeper
Diane Yoshimi of Seattle's Woodland Park Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Another conscientious caretaker is the pygmy marmoset. He's one
of the tiniest primates, at approximately 4 inches and 2 ounces.
But he is a towering father figure. While mom feeds the babes, dad
carries them, watches over them, plays with them, keeps them safe,
and eventually teaches them some of the nurturing skills learned
from his own father.
</P>
<P>
   Many big, oafy bovines are true Good-Time Charlies, running off
to bachelor herds after a one-night stand. A stalwart exception is
the musk ox. These long-haired, prehistoric-looking beasts stick
around mom and babes, acting as protectors, listening to the
pitter-patter of little hooves.
</P>
<P>
   When danger's near, they alert the herd, round up the children,
then ``circle the wagons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The adult males get in big circles, shoulder-to-shoulder,
their derrieres together, facing outward,'' says Reed. ``All the
youngsters are in the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene might have heartened Sigmund Freud, who once
commented: ``I cannot think of any need in childhood as strong as
the need for a father's protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Deserved or not, the Animal Dad of the Year award invariably
goes to the seahorse. His coy, colorful sweetheart injects his
pouch with up to 600 eggs, then scoots, leaving him holding the
bag. The eggs incubate in the nutritive-lined pouch until dad's
belly stretches and swells like a tiny water balloon.
</P>
<P>
   When B-Day arrives, his body begins contracting and contorting,
each spasm expelling tiny, perfectly shaped seahorses.
</P>
<P>
   It's a story with special appeal to female Homo sapiens who have
wished hellish labor pains on indifferent husbands. But it's a
story short on bonding. The seahorse's job is done as his brood
drifts away in a strong current.
</P>
<P>
   A more deserving underwater family man is the eel-like lungfish.
This Mr. Nice Guy broods fertilized eggs in his mouth and, once
they hatch, gingerly introduces his offspring to the big world.
``He guards them, keeps them in the area and, at the least sign of
danger, he opens his mouth and draws them back in,'' says exotics
biologist Bill Robertson at the Seattle Aquarium.
</P>
<P>
   Male mouth brooders are role-switchers from way back.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the tiny Andean Darwin frog, a dad with a communal love
family take on child-rearing. Dandy Andy fertilizes mom's eggs, she
hip-hops off into the sunset, and he and his pals hang out, posing
for Budweiser commercials and watching over the eggs until they're
about to hatch.
</P>
<P>
   When tadpoles look imminent, the Darwinian dad dudes each grab a
clump of eggs, and slide them down their throats into their vocal
pouches. Some days later, out hop their little darlings.
</P>
<P>
   Even bug dads can do right by their women. One pungent example
is the dung beetle, who helps his mate roll up a nice sphere of
ZooDoo for her eggs. The eggs inside the ball develop into larvae,
and the larvae eat up the inside of the poop scoop, emerging feisty
and funky.
</P>
<P>
   Martyrdom's a maternal specialty, but there's one father at
Woodland Park Zoo who could major in it. His name is Abedus herbeti
_ the water bug _ and his woman's a two-timing manipulator. She
glues eggs to his back then bolts, looking for another sexy sucker
doing push-ups on a log.
</P>
<P>
   Dad is stuck carrying the eggs, looking like a miniature
porcupine, unable to eat until the last little bugger breaks its
case and swims free.
</P>
<P>
   Survival of the babes depends on suppression of the appetite.
Explains Erin Sullivan, Woodland Park Zoo bugkeeper: ``If he still
had the eating instinct during this time, he would probably feed on
the young.''
</P>
<P>
   Birddom has its share of stellar dads, too. Particularly
accommodating is the emperor penguin, a tuxedoed, 4-foot gent with
the patience of Job. Shortly after his mate lays a single egg, she
heads out into the icy unknown in search of food. She may be gone
two months or more, leaving him to incubate the egg between feet
and belly in 70-degree-below-zero Antarctic weather.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't eat until mom returns, eager to regurgitate the
months-old, half-digested fish she has collected for her loved ones
to feast on. And it isn't even Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   The handsome, big-headed, red-knobbed hornbill is a regular
zippety-zoo-dad. He dotes on his woman. She seals her self away in
a nest cavity for months to incubate and hatch her three eggs. She
is totally dependent upon dad to provide meals through a tiny
opening in the cavity.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of the three chicks will survive in the nest. Two will
starve. Woodland Park Zoo birdkeeper Erick Kowalczyk, who has a
videocam trained inside a hornbill nest, describes watching a
father feeding a fresh-dead nestling to its two siblings.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly a Norman Rockwell moment.
</P>
<P>
   But it's nature's way _ Father Nature's way.

MEANING OF GAMBLING REPORT DEPENDS ON WHO'S INTERPRETING IT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Nev., Va., N.J.)  (mk) 
 By BRETT PULLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The enduring battle over legalized gambling in the
United States received a new blueprint Friday, as the National
Gambling Impact Study Commission released the results of a
two-year, $5 million study of the social and economic impact that
the gambling boom has had on the nation.
</P>
<P>
   As the report was handed over to President Clinton, members of
Congress, governors and Indian tribal leaders, gambling advocates
and foes alike wasted little time seizing upon the document and
selectively highlighting the aspects that seem to best suit their
positions. Rep. Jim Gibbons, R-Nev., issued a statement proclaiming
that ``as this commission properly reports, gaming enjoys a
positive image as part of the mainstream culture of American
society.'' At the same time, Tom Grey, executive director of the
National Coalition Against Legalized Gambling, called the report
``a wake-up call for America on the dangers of gambling.''
</P>
<P>
   With the work of the nine-member commission now complete, the
scene of the gambling debate will shift venues as state legislators
and Congress must now decide which, if any, of the report's 76
recommended changes for the casinos, state lotteries, pari-mutuel
games and video betting machines that now cover the country will
ever become a reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the great debate begins and we'll have to see where it all
falls out,'' said Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., who sponsored the
legislation that established the commission. Wolf, a staunch
opponent of gambling, said he planned to introduce legislation to
fulfill many of the commission's recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Among the recommendations in the report, which states that
gambling activities ``have become familiar backdrops to daily
life,'' is a call for states to impose a moratorium on gambling
expansion to allow time to assess the impact of any proposed
developments; a requirement that all gambling be limited to people
21 and over since some states allow 18-year-olds to purchase
lottery tickets and patronize casinos; bans on the Internet
gambling business that has mushroomed over the past few years; a
ban on all wagering on college and amateur sports, which currently
takes place only in Las Vegas; a ban on all political contributions
to state and local campaigns, and a curtailing of lottery
advertising as well as a decrease in the number of outlets selling
lottery products.
</P>
<P>
   But no issue seemed to receive more attention from the
commission than problem gambling. Over two thirds of the
recommendations in the report are aimed at research and treatment
for problem gamblers, who the commission found account for 15
percent of the industry's gross revenues. Among those
recommendations is a call for state and tribal governments to use a
``gambling privilege tax'' to create a dedicated fund to address
problem and pathological gambling. Most states with casinos already
collect such a tax but would still need to adopt legislation that
would dedicate some of the money to problem gambling. Another
recommendation calls for providing medical insurance coverage for
problem and pathological gamblers, who the commission said now
amount to 15.4 million adult and adolescent gamblers.
</P>
<P>
   ``That 15.4 million number sticks in my mind,'' said Leo
McCarthy, a member of the commission and a former lieutenant
governor of California. ``That's a fairly heavy price to pay unless
we go after that downside.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such alarming statistics, the very first sentence in the
first chapter of the report states that ``Today, the vast majority
of Americans either gamble recreationally and experience no
measurable side effects related to their gambling, or they choose
not to gamble at all.'' The report goes on to note that because of
legalized gambling, ``sleepy backwaters have become metropolises
almost overnight; skyscrapers rise on the beaches at once-fading
tourist areas; legions of employees testify to the hope and
opportunities that the casinos have brought them and their
families; some Indian nations have leapt from prolonged neglect and
deprivation to sudden abundance.''
</P>
<P>
   Such laudatory phrases were quickly treated like declarations of
emancipation by executives and leaders in the casino industry, who
had feared that the commission would result in a full-scale
indictment of their businesses. ``The verdict is in and the accused
has been exonerated,'' said Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., the president of
the American Gaming Association, the gambling industry's lobbying
arm. In a statement he handed out following Friday's press
conference, he added, ``The commission puts to rest claims of
organized crime involvement, of increased crime related to casinos,
of exaggerated numbers of pathological gamblers, of economic
benefits being outweighed by absurdly high social costs and a host
of other outrageous charges we've had to deal with for years.''
</P>
<P>
   But as was evident by the individual statements that each of the
commissioners made during the press conference, how the report is
interpreted all depends on who is doing the interpreting. James
Dobson, the commission's most strident gambling opponent and the
founder and president of Focus on the Family, a conservative
nonprofit organization, said that after two years of studying the
issue, ``I am even more convinced now that gambling is a
destroyer.''
</P>
<P>
   J. Terrence Lanni, the chairman and chief executive at MGM Grand
casinos and a commission member, lauded his fellow commissioners
for refusing to recommend that the federal government regulate or
tax casinos, as had been feared when the commission first convened.
``The states are best left to determine the regulation and taxation
of this industry,'' he said. He and other commissioners noted that
although they were deeply and emotionally divided on the issue of
gambling from the outset, they were able to compromise and complete
the report. The commission, Lani quipped, ``started with the notion
that we needed metal detectors coming into our meetings.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And for the first time since the commission began its work, Kay
James, the chairwoman, publicly stated her personal position on
gambling. ``Kay James, if it comes as a big surprise, is
anti-gaming,'' she said, referring to herself in the third person.
Ms. James, who recently resigned as dean of the school of
government at Regent University in Virginia, had routinely voted in
favor of anti-gaming measures. But her refusal to impose some tough
measures like federal taxes and regulations on the big casino
companies had led to some recent speculation in the press that she
had been controlled by the powerful gambling industries _ a charge
she denied in no uncertain terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a black, conservative Republican, pro-life, evangelical
Christian,'' Ms. James said. ``Do you think I can be influenced?''
</P>
<P>
   With all of the anxiety and speculation over the commission's
report now behind them, the legislators who can pass the laws that
will affect the gambling industry are girding for a battle. ``Our
goal now is to insure the report's recommendations on under-age and
problem gambling are adopted by policy-makers at the national,
state and local levels,'' said Keith Whyte, executive director of
The National Council on Problem Gambling, a nonprofit organization.
``It's only half time in the game,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With Rep. Wolf of Virginia promising to get legislation passed
in Congress and appeal to the nation's governors to do the same at
the state level, two of New Jersey's representatives in Congress,
who also happen to be two of Atlantic City's biggest champions,
were promising to fight some of the initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with reporters following Friday's press
conference, Rep. Frank LoBiondo, a Republican, and Sen. Robert
Torricelli, a Democrat, said they would oppose dedicating a portion
of the gaming taxes that the state already collects to finance
research and treatment for problem gambling.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be like having a tax on beer because there's a
problem with alcoholism,'' Torricelli said. ``In our society we
deal with funding for these problems on a voluntary basis.''

KAISER PERMANENTE TO CLOSE UNPROFITABLE NORTHEAST UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., N.C., Texas, Vt., Mass., N.J., Ga., Md., Ore., Mo.,
Kan., Wash., Hawaii)   (bl)  
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kaiser Permanente, one of the nation's largest health
maintenance organizations, said Friday that it was closing its
money-losing Northeast division, effective Jan. 1, 2000. The move
affects 575,000 members in four states, including 29,500 in the New
York City suburbs of Westchester County, N.Y., and Fairfield
County, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   The HMO said it lost almost $90 million on nearly $1 billion in
revenue in the Northeast last year. Dr. David Lawrence, the chief
executive of Kaiser Foundation Health Plans and Hospitals, said the
company decided against investing more money into the region.
</P>
<P>
   It was the fourth regional pullback by Kaiser, a nonprofit
company that has been losing money for two years. Kaiser sold its
Texas HMO, with 130,000 members in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, last
year. It also plans to close health plans with 107,000 members in
Charlotte and Raleigh-Durham in North Carolina this year.
</P>
<P>
   The latest shutdown also includes 28,000 Medicare members in
upstate New York, adding to a nationwide pullback by other managed
care companies, which has forced hundreds of thousands of elderly
Americans to switch health plans.
</P>
<P>
   The HMO was unable to attract enough customers in the Northeast,
which for Kaiser consists of New York, Connecticut, Vermont,
Massachusetts, to support its West Coast style of managed care,
which largely relies on large groups of 60 or more specialized
physicians, a Kaiser spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
   Similar problems have plagued HIP, the New York based-HMO. The
HIP unit in New Jersey was forced to file for bankruptcy protection
last year, and the company's growth has been relatively slow in New
York at a time when other managed care companies have expanded
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Patients in the Northeast have favored more loosely organized
types of managed care, including networks of doctors operating from
small separate offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kaiser has been successful in California, but this area of the
country is not ready for that model,'' said Jane Laffner, a senior
consultant in Stamford, Conn., with the Watson Wyatt consulting
firm. ``The Northeast is still a few years behind California, and
this is a Darwinian market,'' where only the strongest survive.
</P>
<P>
   In a region with such big metropolitan areas as New York and
Boston, Kaiser's enrollment was spread thinly across smaller cities
and rural areas, including 97,000 in western Massachusetts. ``We do
best in urban, densely populated areas,'' said Beverly Hayon, a
spokeswoman for Kaiser.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser said its doctors were trying to move to other health
plans in the hope that their patients would transfer with them
rather than switch to new physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of other plans quite eager to get this
enrollment,'' said Dave Rahill, a principal in New York at the
William M. Mercer benefits consulting firm. ``They include Aetna,
Empire Blue Cross, Cigna and Physicians Health Plan in
Connecticut.''
</P>
<P>
   Consultants and employers are already planning to advise Kaiser
customers of other choices when they decide on next year's health
plan, typically in October.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Simek, a spokesman for Xerox Corp., said ``most of our
employees will have a choice of half a dozen alternative plans,
from HMOs to traditional fee-for-service coverage.'' He said
perhaps 200 Xerox employees in the Northeast were enrolled in
Kaiser.
</P>
<P>
   Kaiser had total operating losses of $881 million for 1997 and
1998. It reported a profit of $56 million, or 1.3 percent, from
operations, on revenue of $4.2 billion in the first three months of
1999, its first quarterly profit since Sept. 30, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Subtracting the Northeastern members, Kaiser will have about 8
million members, of which 5.8 million are in California. It also
has HMOs in Washington, Atlanta, Baltimore, Cleveland and Akron,
Ohio, the Kansas City area, Washington state, Oregon and Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna U.S. Healthcare is larger, with about 11.3 million HMO
members. Cigna and United Healthcare Group each have 6.9 million,
according to estimates by Bernstein Research, a Wall Street firm.
</P>
<P>
   To stop its losses, Kaiser raised monthly premium charges ``9 to
10 percent across the country in 1999,'' Ms. Hayon, the Kaiser
spokeswoman, said. She said there were wide variations, up to an
11.7 percent increase at the California state employees pension
system.  &QL;

REPRISE? MEXICO STARTS NEW BILLION-DOLLAR BANK BAILOUTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ As a reminder that the banking system is still a
worrisome weak link in Mexico's robust economy, a newly created
federal bank insurance agency has initiated two huge bailouts
reminiscent of bank rescues of just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, the Bank Savings Protection Institute, decided
hursday to take over Grupo Financiero Serfin SA, Mexico's
third-largest bank. Vicente Corta Fernandez, director of the
agency, said it expected to have to put up at least $1.3 billion to
save the bank, which declared that in practice it was bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Corta said in a radio interview Friday morning that
the agency expected to begin the cleanup of another bank, Bancrecer
SA, in coming weeks. He said the government might have to spend as
much as $9 billion to make the bank sound in preparation for
selling it.
</P>
<P>
   The banking system is the spoiler in the parade of upbeat
economic news from Mexico. In the first quarter, industrial output
expanded at a 4.3 percent annual rate, and purchases by consumers,
which had long lagged behind other signs of growth, rose 1.8
percent. Mexico's government was so confident of a strong
performance this year that it pledged Thursday to reach 5 percent
growth in 2000 and, more significant, to reduce inflation to 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The rescue of Serfin had been expected, but the size of both
bailouts was a surprise.
</P>
<P>
   At an emergency meeting July 8, the Serfin shareholders will be
asked to provide more capital, said Serfin chairman Adolfo Lagos.
But they are expected to decline and swallow the loss of their
investment in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Armendariz, the vice president of the National Banking
and Stock Commission, the top federal regulatory agency, estimated
that Serfin needed a total of $2.1 billion, including capital to be
provided by investors, to return to health.
</P>
<P>
   The bank insurance agency, which went into operation last month,
will inject enough capital to make Serfin viable for sale, Corta
said, and will begin to take bids later in July. All bank deposits
are guaranteed by the government.
</P>
<P>
   All of Mexico's banks sold bad debt to a predecessor bailout
agency in 1995 and 1996, after a devaluation of the peso. But
Serfin's troubles date from before that crisis, starting with the
large concentration of home and commercial mortgages in its
portfolio. When interest rates soared to nearly 100 percent in
1995, thousands of these loans went bad. Analysts said Serfin
unloaded about $6 billion in bad debt on the government in the
first bailout, more than any other bank.
</P>
<P>
   It tried repeatedly to climb out of the hole but was hit last
year by the turmoil in Russia and Brazil and more recently by the
demise of its loans with Altos Hornos de Mexico SA, the country's
largest steelmaker, which recently sought bankruptcy protection.
</P>
<P>
   Corta said the 20 percent stake in Serfin held by HSBC Holdings
PLC, of London, would be preserved.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican banks have seen a wave of foreign takeovers since 1996
as local shareholders failed to find sufficient capital to keep
their banks. Citigroup Inc. and two Spanish banks, Santander and
BBV, are among the leading foreign acquirers.
</P>
<P>
   The reform of the $65 billion bank bailout program became the
stormiest political debate in Mexico in 1998, occupying the
Congress virtually full time for the entire year. Many Mexicans
believed there would be no more bailouts after the new insurance
agency was formed.

LITTON SAID TO PLAN GUILTY PLEA ON IMPROPER-PAYMENTS CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Litton Industries has agreed to plea guilty to
charges stemming from illegal payments it made to secure nearly
$200 million worth of defense business in Greece and Taiwan,
officials close to the case said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The company will plead guilty to three counts, including one of
conspiracy to defraud the government, and pay an $18.5 million
fine, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the negotiated plea agreement, the government will
drop the more serious charges that Litton violated the Foreign
Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits bribes to foreign officials.
If the company had been found guilty of violating that law, it
would have been barred from doing business with the federal
government, a serious blow for the shipbuilding and
defense-electronics giant.
</P>
<P>
   Litton said Friday that it was negotiating with the U.S.
attorney's office in Los Angeles, which is handling the case, but
declined to say anything else publicly. The plea agreement is
likely to be announced next week, a government official said.
</P>
<P>
   Within the government, there was some dissatisfaction that the
foreign bribery charges had been dropped. The law was passed in the
mid-1970s following disclosures that Lockheed had paid millions of
dollars to public officials to win defense contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign companies have long argued that U.S. companies routinely
use ``commissions'' to ``consultants'' to circumvent the law, and
American and foreign critics say that enforcement of the law has
been lax.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a mom and pop grocery store, $18 million would be the end
of the world,'' one official said. ``But for Litton, it's
nothing.'' Litton had earnings in 1998 of $181 million on sales of
$4.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the fine about equaled the company's improper
payments.
</P>
<P>
   Litton Applied Technology paid four Greek agents $12 million in
commissions in a successful effort to win a $150 million contract
to supply radar systems for Greece's F-16 fighter jets, according
to an official. Litton won the contract, in 1993, over stiff
competition from Marconi Defence Systems Ltd., a unit of General
Electric PLC of Britain, according to reports at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Litton first described the payments in the company's books as
``other direct costs,'' and later as ``outside computer services,''
according to an official who has been working on the case.
</P>
<P>
   In Taiwan, Litton Systems Ltd., Canada, paid $4.3 million in
commissions to Richard Hei, a former Taiwan air force officer who
set up a consulting firm when he left the military, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Litton exploited those contacts and illegally paid him
commissions,'' an official involved in the case said. The
commissions were 10 percent of the value of the contract, which is
a routine payment practice in foreign sales.
</P>
<P>
   After being prosecuted by the U.S. government on charges of
income tax evasion, Hei begun cooperating with the government in
its case against Litton, according to government officials.
</P>
<P>
   Hei's largest receipt was $3.2 million, for a $32 million
contract Litton won to upgrade Taiwan's anti-submarine aircraft,
the officials said.

   ATLANTA _ Carbon dioxide, a harmless gas we breathe every day,
is used in a number of ways _ from making the ``fizz'' in soft
drinks to extinguishing fires to cleaning electronic equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The gas is at the heart of the investigation into what caused
illnesses among Europeans who drank Coca-Cola Co. products over the
past week. The company cited defective carbon dioxide in bottles
from a plant in Antwerp, Belgium, for illnesses in that country.
</P>
<P>
   Colorless and odorless, the gas is usually sold as dry ice or in
liquid canisters. Generally, ``there's no concern about its use in
food products,'' said Dr. LarenTolbert, chair of Georgia Tech's
School of Chemistry and Biochemistry.
</P>
<P>
   In the soft drink industry, bottlers use pure carbon dioxide as
a compressed gas in high-pressure tanks. The gas is absorbed into
the flavored soft drink in a ``carbonator'' machine just before the
bottle or can is sealed, according to the National Soft Drink
Association Web site.
</P>
<P>
   When a product has a problem, it's typically not because the
carbon dioxide is defective, said Tolbert, but because canisters or
machinery have become contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   If dissolved in water, carbon dioxide gives the liquid the extra
kick, making natural sources of carbonated water prized for
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   By the early 1900s, companies were producing drinks comprised of
flavored water and carbon dioxide. The gas was created from sodium
salts _ thus the drinks were dubbed ``sodas'' or ``soda pops.''
</P>
<P>
   But carbon dioxide is useful for a number of other purposes. It
is used in some fire extinguishers because it is heavier than air
and does not burn. When sprayed over a fire, it blankets the blaze
and prevents any more oxygen from reaching and feeding the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have found that carbon dioxide in its
``supercritical'' form _ a stage when the gas is under extreme
pressure _ is useful as a cleaning solvent. Both the dry-cleaning
and electronics industries are looking into the gas as a
replacement for more dangerous chemicals, Tolbert said.
</P>
<P>
   Carbon dioxide is also necessary to regulate the Earth's
temperature. When sunlight reaches the Earth, some of the rays are
transferred into heat. Carbon dioxide absorbs some of that heat and
keeps it near the Earth's surface.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists, however, worry that too much heat is being
retained by carbon dioxide _ produced in part by burning fossil
fuels _ creating a greenhouse effect.

WHO OWNS THE BRIDGE? 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, June 20, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Microsoft case is rumbling toward a climax, if not a
conclusion. The trial is in its rebuttal phase. Bill Gates
testified before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress last
week, paying obeisance to what he called, hopefully, ``the light
hand of government.''
</P>
<P>
   Most persons think it is the break-em-up Section 2 of the
Sherman Antitrust Act that the government has in mind. But there is
another precedent, a good deal older than the 1890 statute, that is
as essential in its way to the deep architecture of the Republic as
such landmark decisions as Marbury v. Madison or McCullough v.
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   That is the matter of the Charles River Bridge.
</P>
<P>
   And while it hasn't come up in the formal proceedings, an
argument based on the 170-year-old case by a University of
California law school professor has been making the rounds,
attracting attention among those following the case.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Who Owns the Charles River Bridge? Intellectual Property
and Competition in the Software Industry,'' Ropert P. Merges argues
that if it can be shown that property rights are limiting
innovation, a strong case can be made for limiting them _ in favor
of open competition.
</P>
<P>
   For while the economy has mutated greatly, he says, the
parallels with the past are clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may be deprived of a single focal point such as the Charles
River Bridge case,'' he says, ``although US v. Microsoft is
certainly a candidate.'' But the underlying conflict is the same,
he says _ between private property and open competition. Either all
at once or piecemeal, it will have to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1785 that the Massachusetts legislature granted a
charter to a group of businessmen who promised to build a bridge
from Charlestown to Boston to relieve traffic of the necessity of
the slow and unreliable ferry. The legislature guaranteed the
bridgebuilders tolls for 40 years _ if they succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, the bridge was complete, connecting Charlestown
with Boston's North End -- a technological marvel at the time. The
money started flowing in. Curiously enough, the legislature
promptly extended the monopoly for another 30 years, or 70 years in
all. The original investors floated a public offering. The shares
soared 600 percent. (Historian Stanley Kutler has colorfully
described the saga.)
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1828 that the legislature again voted to charter a
north-south bridge _ to stand right next to the existing facility,
its Charlestown entry barely 90 yards away. Warren Bridge Corp.
would charge the same tolls as the Charles River Bridge, but only
for six years. After that the bridge would become free.
</P>
<P>
   Charles River Bridge investors _ they included Harvard College
and many other leading citizens _ immediately hired Daniel Webster
and Lemuel Shaw to sue the proprietors of the Warren Bridge. The
lawyers, among the most distinguished in the Commonwealth, argued
that creating a new bridge would destroy Charles River's ability to
collect its tolls.
</P>
<P>
   Such a ``taking'' would chill the climate for future investors
for years to come, they said. Economic progress might slow to a
crawl.
</P>
<P>
   The case rose to the US Supreme Court, where it was hampered by
dissension and delayed by the death of Chief Justice John Marshall.
Then in 1835 Marshall was succeeded by Roger Taney. The new chief
justice wore trousers instead of the traditional knee breaches, the
historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. has noted in his classic ``The Age
of Jackson.'' ``He showed in other ways he was prepared to ignore
the past.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1837, the Court finally found for the state against the
plaintiffs. The Warren Bridge would remain open. (It is long gone,
though a successor to the Charles River Bridge connects Boston and
Charlestown today.) ``While the rights of property are sacredly
guarded, we must not forget that the community also have rights,
and that the happiness and well being of every citizen depends on
their faithful preservation,'' Chief Justice Taney wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives, of course, were despondent. They were at odds
with the great public movement that came to be known as Jacksonian
democracy. With the Charles River Bridge decision, the Supreme
Court was seen to have gone over to the populist foe. Taney might
as well have pulverized Plymouyth Rock into gravel; the decision
``undermined the foundations of morality, confidence and truth,''
wrote one prominent jurist in New York.
</P>
<P>
   How exactly does the case reverberate today? In his paper,
Merges notes that today's property rights are much more variegated
and complicated than those of early industrial America, just like
the more complex assets they cover. Often they are held by more
than one firm.
</P>
<P>
   In one key way, however, the ``cornerstone pieces'' of
technological networks resemble the bridge. Their ownership and
control may be used to bar entry of new technologies. They may
stand in the way of competition.
</P>
<P>
   The key has to do with the principle of ``interoperability,'' he
says, as it usually applies in standards-intensive industries,
whose oversight has come to be a central problem of antitrust
policy. Microsoft has been accused of using its dominant position
in a variety of imaginative ways to absorb competitors _ or make it
difficult for them to connect up with its vast network.
</P>
<P>
   Merges surveys developments in intellectual property law,
searching for principles that may be helpful in understanding the
Microsoft debate. In copyright law, he identifies abuses he
describes as ``disproportionate leverage'' and ``user hold up'' _
tiny lock-out codes used to prevent the use of ``unauthorized''
computer game cartridges, for example; or the tendency of
standard-owners to seek to deprive those who have learned to use
their wares of the right to use their skills in other settings
(suppose you could use the standard QWERTY keyboard or a certain
structure of menu commands only on a Microsoft program?).
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Merges tentatively proposes a doctrine he labels
``technological genericide'' to deal with problems like the
ubiquity of the Microsoft Windows operating system. Stated as
bluntly as possible, such a principle borrowed from trademark law
could be interpreted to say: If you are successful enough _ if you
invent a technology that becomes a standard _ we will take your
propery right away.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened to product descriptors like ``cola'' and
``yo-yo'' and ``cellophane,'' after all; why not with a popular
computer operating system? But if the law of property needs
updating, the law of takings will require some re-thinking too,
says Merges. Maybe the solution to the Microsoft problem will turn
out to have to do with publishing or ``opening up'' the propriety
source codes of its Windows operating systems, as a way of putting
them in the public domain. But there would have to be some
compensation _ unless, of course, an antitrust violation is proven.
</P>
<P>
   Merges, 40, is one of the liveliest legal minds around. For a
time he practiced law for the firm of Fenwick &AMP; West in Palo Alto,
Calif. For the last dozen years he has taught, since 1995 at Boalt
Hall, the law school of the University of California at Berkeley;
before that he was at Boston University. His paper was presented at
at a recent conference on competition and innovation in the
computer industry sponsored by Microsoft and other firms. Since
then the paper has been circulating rapidly in

LITTLE LEADERSHIP, BUT PLENTY OF GAMESMANSHIP, BEHIND DEFEAT OF GUN
BILL 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For all the national horror at the carnage in
Littleton, Colo., the sentiment over the school shooting could not
keep gun control legislation from collapsing on the House floor.
All that was left Friday afternoon was a cloud of dust and a bitter
political debate over who killed gun control.
</P>
<P>
   The confounding outcome was the result of a number of factors,
including the narrow majority of House Republicans, the sway of
conservatives over the Republican caucus, the determination of
Democrats to win back the House in 2000 and the differing views in
both parties over how the gun issue will play on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Only an extremely strong leader might have been able to navigate
such cross-currents. But Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois was
little seen, having said he would let members do as they wished. He
even left it up to Rep. Tom DeLay, the majority whip, and Rep. J.C.
Watts, the fourth-ranking leader, to try to explain to reporters
what happened on Friday. (They blamed the Democrats.)
</P>
<P>
   In any event, the passage of something as emotional as gun
control would have taken some goodwill between the parties on
Capitol Hill. But that disappeared long ago, in the days of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   As charges and countercharges flew, Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, the
widow who came to Congress after her husband was killed by a gunman
on the Long Island Rail Road, said, ``This is not a game to me.''
Near tears on the House floor at 1 a.m., the New York Democrat
said, ``This is not a game to the American people.''
</P>
<P>
   But political games were indeed being played by all sides.
</P>
<P>
   The groundwork for Friday's outcome was laid when Hastert spoke
out for some small steps for gun control in the wake of the
Senate's surprise passage of its own modest gun control measures.
He described it only as his personal opinion. But his remarks left
it clear that House Republicans wanted to avoid looking as deaf and
defensive as Senate Republicans did when they considered gun
control last month.
</P>
<P>
   So House Republican leaders then tried to assemble a gun control
bill that conservatives could embrace.
</P>
<P>
   Working with Rep. John D. Dingell, a Democrat from Michigan who
is an avid supporter of gun rights, they crafted a proposal to
regulate gun shows that was blessed by the National Rifle
Association. It was not only the most lenient of several competing
gun show provisions to come to the House floor for consideration,
it arguably weakened current gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Dingell amendment passed with the support of most
Republicans, including some conservatives who normally vote against
gun control measures. And it drew the allegiance of 45 conservative
Democrats, primarily from southern and western districts who
reflect their constituents' embrace of gun rights.
</P>
<P>
   But the passage of Dingell's measure and the subsequent defeat
of a more stringent one sponsored by Mrs. McCarthy left many
Democrats determined to oppose the final bill, rather than allow
the Republicans to say they had made a modest step on gun control.
``Morally I cannot vote for it, because it does set us back,'' said
Mrs. McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans gave Democrats some reasons to vote for the
bill, and a few more reasons to oppose it.
</P>
<P>
   The House approved an amendment requiring safety locks to be
sold with handguns and another banning the import of high-capacity
ammunition clips. But it also weakened District of Columbia gun
laws by voting to allow residents with no criminal history to
possess loaded handguns in their homes. And at the very last moment
Republicans blocked any House vote at all on a measure that would
have raised the minimum age for all handgun purchases from 18 to
21.
</P>
<P>
   In response, all but 10 Democrats opposed the bill en masse _
choosing to have a campaign issue against the Republicans rather
than a very modest gun control measure. The package was defeated
280 to 147.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton himself immediately began the Democratic
campaign refrain saying, ``This week, instead of listening to the
American people and strengthening our gun laws, the House of
Representatives listened to the gun lobby and did nothing at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic rebellion meant that in order to pass the
legislation virtually all Republicans would have to vote for it.
Hastert had originally called gun control a ``vote of conscience''
and said Republicans would let members do as they wished. While he
stood back DeLay rallied conservatives to support Dingell's measure
but left it ambiguous whether he would vote for the final bill. (He
did.)
</P>
<P>
   Then just a few hours before the vote Friday, Republican leaders
met and Hastert called for an all-out effort to pass the bill,
Republicans said. Hastert even appeared personally Friday before
Republican moderates to seek their vote.
</P>
<P>
   But 82 Republicans broke with their party to vote against the
bill. Some were moderates like Rep. Marge Roukema of New Jersey,
who had co-sponsored Mrs. McCarthy's measure, and Rep. Tom Campbell
of California, who tried to help Democrats by bringing to the floor
speaker after speaker whom he introduced as a ``reasonable
Republican for reasonable gun control.''
</P>
<P>
   Also voting against the bill were a number of southern and
midwestern conservatives who are proud supporters of the Second
Amendment's right to bear arms and were opposed to any gun control
at all, despite the Republican effort to bring them onto the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we did was ultimately craft a bill that nobody was
pleased with,'' said Rep. Bob Riley, an Alabama Republican who
voted against the measure because he thought it contained too much
gun regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans, however, focused on the Democrats in
explaining the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is quite obvious to me that they are just interested in
politics,'' DeLay said, ``not interested in even getting what they
could get with the votes that were available to be had by the
House.''
</P>
<P>
   How gun control will ultimately affect the battle for the House
is uncertain. It was once thought that gun rights advocates are a
potent single-issue voting bloc while gun control supporters do not
turn out at the polls with the same intensity.
</P>
<P>
   And many Republicans _ who won the House majority in 1994 with
the help of the National Rifle Association _ believe that this
political maxim still holds true.
</P>
<P>
   Some gleeful Republican strategists said Friday that several
Democrats from conservative regions of the country had cast a vote
that would come back to haunt them when they stood with their party
on the Dingell amendment. They named Representatives Bart Stupak
and David Bonior of Michigan, Bob Etheridge of North Carolina and
Collin C. Peterson of Minnesota as Democrats who they will try to
tar as gun control zealots in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats argued that the school shootings have changed the
political equation since 1994 and that fearful suburban parents
will emerge as a political counterforce to the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be a one-sided issue,'' said Rep. Barney Frank, a
Massachusetts Democrat. ``Now it's a two-sided issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats noted that many of the most hotly contested House
seats are now suburban and that suburbanites turn out strongly in
presidential election years. But Frank admitted that it is hard to
judge now whether voters will be thinking about school shootings in
18 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody is running for office tomorrow or next week,'' he said.
``They are running for office in November of 2000. If it will still
have the immediacy, nobody knows.''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 20)  
 (af)  
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Everybody knows that the American consumer has been
the high-octane fuel behind the nation's decadelong economic boom.
Retail spending, after all, accounts for two-thirds of the output
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But it is becoming increasingly apparent that American shoppers
are also fueling the recoveries just starting to be charted in
depressed economies overseas. And this alarms James W. Paulsen,
chief investment officer of Wells Capital Management in
Minneapolis, who believes that a slowdown in consumption here could
stop the improving economies elsewhere dead in their tracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American consumer has taken the globe from deep
contraction back to flatness to recovery,'' Paulsen said. ``If he
slows down at all, we're going to feel the world weak again.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of just how dependent the world has become on the
American consumer shows up in this country's imports as a
percentage of the growth in world output. In 1995, such imports
were about 4 percent of the industrial world's gross domestic
product. Today the figure is 7.5 percent; fully 1.5 percentage
points of that gain has come since the Asian crisis began.
</P>
<P>
   So while the economic turmoil overseas was a nightmare for the
rest of the world, it meant a big windfall for Americans as prices
of goods and money dropped. And much of that windfall was spent at
the mall.
</P>
<P>
   People have been baffled, Paulsen said, about ``why auto sales
are off the chart, why housing sales are so strong.''
</P>
<P>
   His answer: ``We were dropping the monthly prices of those
things dramatically, because interest rates kept falling. Deflation
drove the unit growth of these things through the roof.'' The
accompanying chart shows the relationship between declining
inflation and surging retail sales, excluding autos.
</P>
<P>
   But almost all of this has reversed in recent months. And that,
Paulsen said, poses a threat to American stocks.
</P>
<P>
   While retail sales remain red-hot _ up an impressive 1 percent
in May _ they are sure to slow in coming months. That's because the
major factors stimulating consumer spending have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates, for example, are no longer falling, which means
American homeowners' harvests of cash from refinancing their
mortgages are history. Oil prices have risen as well, removing
another piece from the prosperity puzzle. Perhaps most important,
annual growth in real wages has fallen from about 3 percent early
last year to around 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, if the American consumer snaps his wallet shut,
there is nobody out there to take his place in fueling the world's
economic growth. Europe is showing only 2 percent growth in GDP,
and economies in most of Asia and Latin America are either flat or
contracting. Moreover, investment by corporations is expected to be
static this year.
</P>
<P>
   Add to this mix a move by the Federal Reserve Board at the end
of June to increase interest rates, and Paulsen thinks corporate
profits may be hurt and economies around the world strained. ``If
the world just moves to slower growth but doesn't crunch, it's a
huge bull run again,'' he said. ``If it really slows down and gets
into a more scary scenario, then the whole stock market gets into
trouble.'' &QL;

THE MODERN GETS TO KEEP MALEVICH WORKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An unusual legal settlement reached Friday will allow
the Museum of Modern Art to retain 15 works by the Russian
avant-garde artist Kazimir Malevich that it has held in safe
keeping since 1935, in exchange for a cash payment to Malevich's 31
descendants.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the payment, believed to be $5 million, the
descendants _ grandchildren, nieces and nephews in Russia and
Eastern Europe _ will receive one painting, ``Suprematist
Composition,'' which dates from 1923-1925 and which experts say is
worth about $10 million. The Modern will keep six paintings and
nine works on paper.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the parties said they believed the agreement
to be the first settlement between a major international museum and
citizens of the former Soviet Union. (A lawyer for the Malevich
heirs said they were also discussing ownership of works held by the
Busch-Reisinger Museum at Harvard University, and more than 30
paintings at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam.) The agreement with
the Modern concludes a saga that spans some of the greatest
upheavals of the 20th century, including the formation of the
Soviet Union and the rise of Nazism.
</P>
<P>
   How these paintings and drawings ultimately found their way from
1920s Leningrad to 1930s Berlin to New York's Museum of Modern Art
is a complex tale of politics, history and the daring of Alfred
Barr, the Modern's founding director. It was not until 1993, after
the breakup of the Soviet Union, that the heirs came forward with
their claims. Even though it took years to settle the two sides
said negotiations were amicable. Officials at the Modern expressed
relief that the dispute over ownership has been settled. ``It is
rare we can find an equitable solution to a complex problem,'' said
Glenn Lowry, director of the Museum of Modern Art.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, after holding the works for nearly three decades and no
heirs came forward to claim them, the museum made the borrowed
works part of its permanent collection. Many of the paintings have
been on view since 1935 and almost constantly since 1963.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never clear what Malevich's intentions were or who
actually owned the art. This is a case where we were all acting in
the best interest of the artist in trying to work out an
arrangement that benefits everybody, while ensuring the public
access to Malevich's greatest works.''
</P>
<P>
   Malevich, a major 20th-century painter who was the the founder
of Suprematism, Modernism's first completely abstract painting
style, was known for his austere, simplistic forms like the iconic
painting ``White Square on White'' from 1918. He was as much a
theoretician as a painter. His works often held an underlying
political message.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1935, Barr was traveling through Europe in
search of works to include in what would become the seminal 1936
exhibition ``Cubism and Abstract Art.'' While in Germany, Barr met
with Alexander Dorner, the director of the Provinzialmuseum (which
was later renamed the Landesmuseum) in Hannover. Dorner took Barr
to the basement of his museum and revealed a cache of paintings,
drawings and charts by the already renowned pioneer of the Abstract
movement which was shaking the foundations of the art world. Dorner
had stashed the works for safe keeping, since the Nazis had banned
such art as ``degenerate.''
</P>
<P>
   Barr, believing that Dorner was an agent for Malevich, bought
two paintings and two drawings for the Modern's permanent
collection. Fearing that the Nazi government might stop the export
of Malevich's works, Barr later told how he smuggled the paintings
across the German-Dutch border by rolling them up and wrapping them
in his umbrella. He put the drawings in his suitcase and described
them to authorities as ``study materials.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Provinzialmuseum, Barr borrowed 17 other works for the
exhibition he was organizing. Dorner shipped them to New York using
an assumed name, officials at the Modern said. Soon after, Dorner
returned the remaining Malevich works to Hugo Haring, an architect
and friend of whom the artist entrusted with many works during
World War II. Around 1937, Dorner resigned from the
Provinzialmuseum and emigrated to the United States. Reluctant to
return Malevich's works to Nazi Germany, which had officially
denounced modern art and sold or destroyed the work of many
artists, Barr decided it would be safer to keep them at the Modern.
</P>
<P>
   But by the mid-1920s, after Stalin's rise to power, Soviet
authorities viewed Malevich's art with increasing suspicion and he
was attacked in the Soviet press because his art was thought to be
too antiproletarian and counter-revolutionary.
</P>
<P>
   After years of trying to leave Russia, Malevich was granted his
first and only exit visa in 1927 to show his works in Berlin. He
took with him about 100 works for an exhibition at the Berliner
Ausstellung where an entire room was devoted to his paintings,
drawings, architectural models and theoretical writings. When the
artist was suddenly recalled to the Soviet Union in early June,
before his visa had expired, he left his art behind.
</P>
<P>
   Russian artist Naum Gabo, who knew Malevich in the 1920s, told
art historians that he believed the paintings Malevich brought to
Germany would have ``no future in the U.S.S.R. since abstract
painting was officially discouraged.''
</P>
<P>
   Until his death in Leningrad in 1935, Malevich tried to return
to the West without success. But he made no efforts to bring his
art back to the Soviet Union, where it continued to be attacked by
critics because of the unorthodox nature of his work. In 1930, a
retrospective of his work closed in Kiev shortly after it opened.
Around that time he was arrested in Leningrad, detained for two
months and questioned about his work. In 1933, the ailing artist's
requests to go abroad for medical treatment were denied by Soviet
authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Works that were in the custody of Haring and Dorner are still
the focus of ownership claims by the artist's relatives. Lawrence
Kaye, their lawyer, said that besides the painting and drawing that
Dorner had given to the Busch-Reisinger at Harvard, the heirs are
seeking works held by the Stedelijk Museum which had had been lent
in exchange for an annual fee payable to Haring, who had left
Berlin in 1943 and later lent and then sold the works to the
Stedlijk Museum.
</P>
<P>
   This leaves the question of what Malevich's many heirs plan to
do with their painting returned by the Modern. Will it eventually
find its way to auction? ``They haven't made a decision,'' said
Kaye. ``Right now they're just happy to have it.''

LET'S HEAR IT FOR THE MR. MOMS OF THE ANIMAL KINGDOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By M.L. LYKE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Your Homo sapiens dad's a real stand-up guy.
</P>
<P>
   But would he roll you up in a dung ball for protection?
</P>
<P>
   Would he undergo wrenching contractions to give birth to you and
a couple hundred siblings?
</P>
<P>
   Would he sacrifice food for a significant chunk of his limited
life span to carry you through incubation _ then stifle a gnawing
urge to eat you?
</P>
<P>
   Raise those fins and claws and pointy little talons and give it
up for the Mr. Moms of the animal kingdom, those hard-working,
overlooked Superdads who do twice the work and get half the credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always hear about the mothers, not the fathers,'' says
Holly Reed, associate veterinarian at Point Defiance Zoo and
Aquarium in Tacoma. ``The male has a major role in a number of
obscure species.''
</P>
<P>
   This oversight is understandable. Earth moms are easy. Most coo
and cuddle, lick and suckle, nest and nurture.
</P>
<P>
   Their mates present a more complicated picture. There are
deadbeat dads who breed-and-run. And worse.
</P>
<P>
   Sea lion dads have a nasty tendency to roll over and squish
young pups. Roaringly hungry Daddie Dearest bears have been known
to make quick meals of small cubs. And alligators, although gentle
lovers and faithful mates, will _ given half a chance _ dine on the
tasty eggs containing their young.
</P>
<P>
   But animal dads can be endearingly tender.
</P>
<P>
   One beguiling papa is the pint-size Golden Lion tamarin, a
miniature Chewbacca with a coat the color of honey. Several weeks
after mom gives birth, the little fellow takes over, carrying his
gold children nestled in the silky fur of his back.
</P>
<P>
   Even when they're big kids, the tamarins rely on dad. ``When
they get scared, they will still jump back on him,'' says zookeeper
Diane Yoshimi of Seattle's Woodland Park Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   Another conscientious caretaker is the pygmy marmoset. He's one
of the tiniest primates, at approximately 4 inches and 2 ounces.
But he is a towering father figure. While mom feeds the babes, dad
carries them, watches over them, plays with them, keeps them safe,
and eventually teaches them some of the nurturing skills learned
from his own father.
</P>
<P>
   Many big, oafy bovines are true Good-Time Charlies, running off
to bachelor herds after a one-night stand. A stalwart exception is
the musk ox. These long-haired, prehistoric-looking beasts stick
around mom and babes, acting as protectors, listening to the
pitter-patter of little hooves.
</P>
<P>
   When danger's near, they alert the herd, round up the children,
then ``circle the wagons.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The adult males get in big circles, shoulder-to-shoulder,
their derrieres together, facing outward,'' says Reed. ``All the
youngsters are in the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   The scene might have heartened Sigmund Freud, who once
commented: ``I cannot think of any need in childhood as strong as
the need for a father's protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Deserved or not, the Animal Dad of the Year award invariably
goes to the seahorse. His coy, colorful sweetheart injects his
pouch with up to 600 eggs, then scoots, leaving him holding the
bag. The eggs incubate in the nutritive-lined pouch until dad's
belly stretches and swells like a tiny water balloon.
</P>
<P>
   When B-Day arrives, his body begins contracting and contorting,
each spasm expelling tiny, perfectly shaped seahorses.
</P>
<P>
   It's a story with special appeal to female Homo sapiens who have
wished hellish labor pains on indifferent husbands. But it's a
story short on bonding. The seahorse's job is done as his brood
drifts away in a strong current.
</P>
<P>
   A more deserving underwater family man is the eel-like lungfish.
This Mr. Nice Guy broods fertilized eggs in his mouth and, once
they hatch, gingerly introduces his offspring to the big world.
``He guards them, keeps them in the area and, at the least sign of
danger, he opens his mouth and draws them back in,'' says exotics
biologist Bill Robertson at the Seattle Aquarium.
</P>
<P>
   Male mouth brooders are role-switchers from way back.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the tiny Andean Darwin frog, a dad with a communal love
family take on child-rearing. Dandy Andy fertilizes mom's eggs, she
hip-hops off into the sunset, and he and his pals hang out, posing
for Budweiser commercials and watching over the eggs until they're
about to hatch.
</P>
<P>
   When tadpoles look imminent, the Darwinian dad dudes each grab a
clump of eggs, and slide them down their throats into their vocal
pouches. Some days later, out hop their little darlings.
</P>
<P>
   Even bug dads can do right by their women. One pungent example
is the dung beetle, who helps his mate roll up a nice sphere of
ZooDoo for her eggs. The eggs inside the ball develop into larvae,
and the larvae eat up the inside of the poop scoop, emerging feisty
and funky.
</P>
<P>
   Martyrdom's a maternal specialty, but there's one father at
Woodland Park Zoo who could major in it. His name is Abedus herbeti
_ the water bug _ and his woman's a two-timing manipulator. She
glues eggs to his back then bolts, looking for another sexy sucker
doing push-ups on a log.
</P>
<P>
   Dad is stuck carrying the eggs, looking like a miniature
porcupine, unable to eat until the last little bugger breaks its
case and swims free.
</P>
<P>
   Survival of the babes depends on suppression of the appetite.
Explains Erin Sullivan, Woodland Park Zoo bugkeeper: ``If he still
had the eating instinct during this time, he would probably feed on
the young.''
</P>
<P>
   Birddom has its share of stellar dads, too. Particularly
accommodating is the emperor penguin, a tuxedoed, 4-foot gent with
the patience of Job. Shortly after his mate lays a single egg, she
heads out into the icy unknown in search of food. She may be gone
two months or more, leaving him to incubate the egg between feet
and belly in 70-degree-below-zero Antarctic weather.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't eat until mom returns, eager to regurgitate the
months-old, half-digested fish she has collected for her loved ones
to feast on. And it isn't even Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   The handsome, big-headed, red-knobbed hornbill is a regular
zippety-zoo-dad. He dotes on his woman. She seals her self away in
a nest cavity for months to incubate and hatch her three eggs. She
is totally dependent upon dad to provide meals through a tiny
opening in the cavity.
</P>
<P>
   Only one of the three chicks will survive in the nest. Two will
starve. Woodland Park Zoo birdkeeper Erick Kowalczyk, who has a
videocam trained inside a hornbill nest, describes watching a
father feeding a fresh-dead nestling to its two siblings.
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly a Norman Rockwell moment.
</P>
<P>
   But it's nature's way _ Father Nature's way.
</P>

Robert Wallace, ``The LaRousse Encyclopedia of Animal Life,'' and

FOR THESE 8TH GRADERS, SIGNIFICANCE OF GRADUATION IS GENUINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)   (bl)  
 By SARA RIMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Decked out in blue caps and gowns, the eighth
graders took the stage in a sweltering gym packed with family
members and local dignitaries. The guest speaker, Alice Turkel, a
school committee member, compared them to the residents of the
mythical Lake Wobegone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every graduate at Graham and Parks is above average,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Solo, the principal of Graham and Parks, a progressive
public elementary and middle school in Cambridge, sent his students
off into the world with advice from Bob Dylan: ``Now each of us has
his own special gift; you know that was meant to be true, and if
you don't underestimate me, I won't underestimate you.'' Then Solo
hugged each of them as they walked across the stage to claim their
diplomas.
</P>
<P>
   For the 47 eighth graders, most of whom had entered Graham and
Parks in kindergarten, Thursday's graduation had loomed every bit
as large as the other, more widely publicized commencement that was
held last week across town, at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so permanent, final and definite,'' said Rachel
Philbrick, 14. ``Nothing will ever be the same. I'll never be in
this school again.''
</P>
<P>
   With all the melodrama of youth, Henrietta Oakley, 14, added,
``It's the end _ the end of everything.''
</P>
<P>
   In many communities, graduations are so common at all grade
levels, starting with preschool, that they begin to lose their
significance as turning points in life. But at Graham and Parks,
leaving eighth grade is so momentous, and the school makes such a
fuss over graduation, that it becomes a time when 13- and
14-year-olds normally preoccupied with such things as, say, the
symbolism of sneaker laces and face glitter, are instead pondering
the meaning of transitions.
</P>
<P>
   It was the end of elementary school, the end of moving together
as a class through the day, the end of recess, the end of life in
the four-story red brick building where, with only 376 students, it
is possible to know just about everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, like so many other endings, graduation also marks the
beginning of other things, starting with high school. ``It's the
first step to the real world,'' said Stephane Gracia, 13.
</P>
<P>
   Isabel Yalouris, 14, said she was ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in second grade, I felt I could be in elementary
school for the rest of my life,'' she said. ``But now, whoa! I've
got to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Three nights before his graduation, Judd Bornheimer, 14, stayed
up an hour past his bedtime, reviewing his life at Graham and
Parks. ``I was just sitting in bed, in the dark, thinking about
what I've gone through,'' he said. ``My first day in kindergarten,
I cried, `Mom and Dad, don't leave me!' I was very shy, very
family-oriented.''
</P>
<P>
   These days no one would call Judd shy. With his teachers
commending his kindness to others, he shared the Graham and Parks
community service award today with a classmate, Daniel Mehr. Judd
has his own call-in show on a Cambridge cable television station.
He is a lineman on the Warriors, a Pop Warner football team. He has
overcome some major obstacles, including the breakup of his
parents' marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm becoming my own person,'' Judd said.
</P>
<P>
   This has naturally created conflicts with his mother, Carole
Bellew.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been disagreeing on a lot of things,'' Judd said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to tie my sneakers on the fourth lace,'' he said. ``She
wants me to tie them on the sixth lace. She doesn't understand what
I'm going through.''
</P>
<P>
   Ketna Julmeus, 13, who is the president of the eighth grade
class and who arrived from Haiti five years ago, feels the same way
about her father. ``He doesn't understand American culture,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   While many of Ketna's friends are exploring their newly found
interest in the opposite sex, Ketna says her father has decreed
that she may not have a boyfriend before she is 20. That does not
stop her from daydreaming. ``What would it be like if I had a
boyfriend?'' she said. ``Would it affect my schoolwork?''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-two percent of the students at Graham and Parks _ the
school is named for Rosa Parks and Saundra Graham, an
African-American Cambridge community organizer _ are white and 58
percent are African-American, Asian or Hispanic. They are the sons
and daughters of bookkeepers and cabdrivers as well as doctors and
college professors. They boast about the diversity of their class.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Graham and Parks, like childhood itself, is no utopia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was ridiculed from kindergarten to third grade,'' Daniel
Mehr said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was big,'' said Daniel who, at 6 feet 2 inches tall, towers
over his classmates. ``And I was always somewhat chubby. In the
beginning, I went to the teacher. But then I said, `What the heck,
they're going to keep doing it, I might as well get used to it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel has since found a circle of friends who share his
interest in math and science, sailing and laser tag. But he will be
leaving the group in September. His family is moving to the suburbs
so that Daniel can go to the nationally acclaimed Lexington High
School.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his classmates are going on to Cambridge Rindge and
Latin, the public high school here, with 2,500 students. ``We're
going to a huge high school where we're going to know nobody,''
Henrietta Oakley said.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Wisner, 14, said he wished he could join the handful of his
classmates who will be going to private schools. ``Rindge is too
big,'' he said. ``You could get lost. A private school is more of a
community.''
</P>
<P>
   And Ben said he worried that there could be gang members at the
high school. While gangs have not made inroads at Graham and Parks,
he said he had been fending off their approaches in the
neighborhood. Ben, who plays basketball, soccer and golf, said he
had no interest in joining a gang.
</P>
<P>
   Emma Alexander, 14, has other worries. ``The older kids are big,
and tall,'' said Emma, a star soccer player who is 5 feet 2 inches
tall.
</P>
<P>
   It is not only high school that Emma and her classmates are
worried about getting lost in. ``We're told we can be anything and
do anything,'' Isabel Yalouris said. But she already knows that
reality may be somewhat different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be an actress,'' Isabel said. ``But you can go to
Hollywood and be a nothing. You can fall through the cracks.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan McCray was listening to Isabel, Emma and Ben talk moments
before graduation. Ms. McCray had taught the eighth graders
humanities. She had been in the school, watching them emerge, since
they were in fourth grade. ``It's the end of childhood,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kids,'' Isabel said. ``We're older kids, but we're still
kids.''

BOB BULLOCK, A TITAN OF TEXAS POLITICS, DIES AT 69  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bob Bullock, among the last of the earthy, string-pulling,
hard-living political giants who used to sprout in Texas as thick
as bluebonnets, died early Friday at his home in Austin from what
aides said was congestive heart failure. He was 69.
</P>
<P>
   Blunt, mercurial and often fearsome, Bullock, a Democrat, was an
iron spine wrapped in a drawl. He had been at the center of Texas
politics for 40 years and dominated many of them, particularly in
his two terms as lieutenant governor beginning in 1990 and ending
in January.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Texas constitution, the lieutenant governor presides
over the State Senate, makes all committee appointments, sits on
every important state board and controls the flow of legislation,
making him in practice often more powerful than the governor.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock relished that power, and he used it.
</P>
<P>
   Coming from an era before sound bites and media events, Bullock
excelled at back-room arm-twisting and long, gaudy stories that
dragged through the afternoon and into the evening. In the 1970's
and 80's, when he held various state offices, Bullock was notorious
both for long workdays and for hard-drinking sessions with
co-workers and the capital press corps. Though calmer times and
failing health forced him to slow down in recent years, he
maintained his hard edge and spoke with fondness of the old, rowdy
days.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no words big enough to capture Bob Bullock,'' Gov.
George W. Bush said Friday in a statement. Bush had forged such a
close working relationship with him that Bullock endorsed Bush for
re-election last year, even though Bush is a Republican and Bullock
was godfather to a child of Bush's Democratic opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Bullock was the largest Texan of our time,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Alternately confiding and intimidating, Bullock relished a
profane punch line. Once, on a hunting trip, a gun accidentally
went off inside a car carrying him and his mentor, former Gov.
Preston Smith. ``I thought I'd shot the governor,'' Bullock
remarked. ``That would have been like shooting the only whore in
Waxahachie.''
</P>
<P>
   Another time, after he had had hemorrhoid surgery, Bullock sent
a jar of chopped oysters to an Austin reporter with whom he had
been feuding, claiming they were the results of his operation.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hobby, Bullock's chief of staff in the 1991 legislative
session, wrote in a tribute last year that after Bullock announced
his retirement, another state official turned and said, ``He's the
last of them, isn't he?''
</P>
<P>
   There was no need to explain what the remark meant, Hobby said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when giant political personalities roamed the
state capitol,'' Hobby said. ``In a white-male dominated,
trading-floor atmosphere, Jurassic behavior was widely accepted.
Money, bluff, intimidation and superior information were the trump
cards, and no one played them better than Bob Bullock.''
</P>
<P>
   Before becoming lieutenant governor, Bullock served 16 years as
state comptroller, taking what was considered a backwater in Austin
politics and transforming it into one of the most powerful
positions in state government. He did it by availing himself of
every ounce of power that the office possessed, including ones that
he had discovered. Shortly after taking office, he found that the
comptroller had the authority to close down businesses that failed
to pay their state taxes. So Bullock staged a series of raids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reporters were tipped off in advance and arrived at the same
time as the comptroller and his agents,'' remembered Bill Collier,
a former press spokesman for Bullock, in a 1980 Texas Monthly
article. ``Bullock would stroll into the targeted businesses,
followed by the media, and while cameras rolled and pencils
scribbled, he would demand payment. If it was not made, the place
closed down on the spot. It was the best show in town wherever it
went.''
</P>
<P>
   As lieutenant governor, colleagues remembered, Bullock played
the legislature like a steel guitar, threatening, cajoling, keeping
encyclopedic track of every important piece of legislation, handing
out favors, withholding others and generally presiding over the
whole messy affair like a circus ringmaster.
</P>
<P>
   Born in the small town of Hillsboro, about 60 miles south of
Dallas, Robert D. Bullock was elected to the state legislature in
1957 while still a law student at Baylor University. Later, he
practiced law, was an assistant state attorney general and an aide
to Gov. Smith who, in 1971, appointed him secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   But it was his terms as state comptroller that transformed
Bullock into a popular statewide figure. And for years he dreamed
of becoming governor.
</P>
<P>
   But in the late 1970s, complaints about his drinking and
accusations of misuse of state airplanes and public funds _ later
investigated by a grand jury that decided not to indict him _
tarnished Bullock's glow and resigned him to the fact that he would
never be governor.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the long hours and hard living were playing havoc
with his health.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, he lost about a third of a lung in surgery to remove a
tumor, yet continued to be a chain smoker. In 1977, depression led
him to the brink of shooting himself. ``The steel was ice-cold in
my mouth,'' he later recalled. He was treated and urged to quit
drinking, which he did, for a while.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, an Austin police officer arrested him for drunken
driving and he pleaded guilty. In 1979, he had a heart attack. In
1981, he underwent treatment for alcoholism and began to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   But his health was irrevocably affected.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock's political life also played havoc with his personal
life. He was divorced four times and is survived by his fifth wife,
Jan Bullock of Austin; a son, Robert D. Bullock Jr. of Austin; a
daughter, Lindy Ward of Austin; a step-daughter, Kimberly Ader of
Houston, and a brother, Tom Bullock of Brenham, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``On and off for 40 years, I have walked through the halls of
this magnificent Capitol building in partnership with the people of
Texas,'' Bullock said when announcing his retirement last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only death will end my love affair with Texas.''

   Is He Getting Ready To Return to Belgrade? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As NATO troops rolled into Kosovo last week and Serbian troops
rolled out, Milan Panic, who took time out from running ICN
Pharmaceuticals to serve briefly as Yugoslavia's prime minister in
1992, shuttled around European capitals and the United Nations. His
goal was to get rid of Slobodan Milosovic and rebuild Yugoslovia
under a democratic leader, perhaps by the name of Milan Panic.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview at the United Nations last week, Panic said
weighty things like, ``We have a very serious legal, political and
practical problem.'' He could have been referring to ICN as well as
the country. ICN, based in Costa Mesa, Calif., watched the Yugoslav
government confiscate its Belgrade plant in February.
</P>
<P>
   Panic evidently thinks that what's good for ICN is good for
Yugoslavia, leadership included. ``Officially, Milan would say he's
not interested in running the country,'' said Eugene Melnitchenko,
a health care analyst with Sutro &AMP; Co. in Los Angeles. But, he
added, ``If given the opportunity, he would do so.'' &QL;

   UBS Is for Art Lovers  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last week, many wealthy collectors thronged Art Basel, the
reknowned 20th-century art fair, which runs through Monday. Among
them were Charles Schwab; Arthur Fleischer, the New York takeover
lawyer; Mick Flick, a Daimler-Benz executive; Achille Maramotti,
the owner of Max Mara, the clothing company, and Jochen Holy, a
former owner of Hugo Boss.
</P>
<P>
   It's tough competing for attention with all the art. But UBS,
with three art advisory offices in Europe, sees the fair as a
chance to expand that business, which includes trading,
transporting and storing art for those who have at least $675,000
in assets with the bank.
</P>
<P>
   So under Karl Schweizer, the head of art banking at UBS, the
company built a lounge in the form of an Italian villa (with faux
marble walls, gilt borders and a fountain), where its private
banking clients could sip Moet and nibble on aged Parmesan and
Parma ham. Groups of 50 were treated to dinner and music in UBS's
own red-velvet restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Americans were especially welcome, since UBS plans to open an
art banking office in New York this year, competing with Citibank.
</P>
<P>
   Does the wooing work? ``Ask me after the fair, and I'll tell
you,'' Schweizer said. &QL;

   There Goes the Island? &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The battle among the millionaires who live on Fisher Island _
home to various retired chief executives, the financier Bennett S.
LeBow, Oprah Winfrey and Mel Brooks _ continues over condomium
development on this exclusive redoubt a short ferry ride from Miami
Beach.
</P>
<P>
   On June 10, John Melk, the Chicago investor who paid more than
$50 million last year for development rights, marshaled the votes
to suspend Isadore and Maxine Pines, his most ardent opponents,
from membership in the Fisher Island Club. Their offense: wearing
``Save Fisher Island'' T-shirts. The Pineses say that Melk's plan
to build 315 million-dollar-plus condominiums will cause
overcrowding, delays for golfers and long waits for the ferry.
</P>
<P>
   The presidents of the island's condominium associations struck
back by electing Pines, ex-chairman of Hebrew National, to the
board of the Fisher Island Community Association.
</P>
<P>
   That infuriated Melk, who says he is building only about half
the number of condominiums allowed. While Melk has started
construction, Pines has continued to put up ``Save Fisher Island''
billboards, pass out leaflets and hire people to picket the
island's sales office.

<P>
   Uwe E. Reinhardt, a leading health policy pundit, professor of
political economy at Princeton University and headliner on the
lecture circuit, is the latest academic luminary to be recruited as
a board member by an industry on his radar screen. He recently
joined the board at Triad Hospitals Inc., a group spun off last
month by Columbia-HCA Healthcare.
</P>
<P>
   Reinhardt, 60, hardly your corporate conformist, is quite the
zingermeister, having described managed-care moguls, for example,
as ``bounty hunters'' who live by squeezing money from doctors and
hospitals. After spurning several other offers, he signed up with
Triad, a 33-hospital group based in Dallas, much more for
experience and insight than for money, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reinhardt said he wanted to see how for-profit hospitals look at
ground level, rather than from the policy wonk perspective that he
compares to ``flying at 37,000 feet.'' He will get $18,000 a year
plus $1,500 a meeting _ no great sum, he said, after accounting for
board homework, travel to meetings and possibly missing lecture
gigs. Putting Princeton first, he skipped the first Triad board
meeting last month to supervise final exams.

AGREEMENT REACHED ON DEPLOYMENT OF RUSSIAN TROOPS IN KOSOVO 

</HEADLINE>

By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOGNE, Germany _ The United States and Russia finally reached
an agreement Friday on deployment of Kremlin troops as part of the
international force occupying Kosovo, almost completely on lines
long demanded by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   After three days of negotiations in Helsinki, Finland, Russia
abandoned its key plea for a separate zone for its troops. A
Russian force of 2,850 soldiers will be spread among three other
sectors of the war-torn province already assigned to troops from
the United States, Germany and France. The Russians will be part of
a total force of about 50,000.
</P>
<P>
   The chief concession to the Russians was that a contingent of an
additional 750 of its soldiers will be deployed at the airport in
Pristina, the provincial capital, where they will serve primarily
as maintenance and security personnel. Russia also will have a
representative at each NATO command center involved in the
peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, which is expected to be approved Saturday by
NATO's political arm, is the final step in implementing the peace
plan that ended the alliance's 78-day air attack on the forces of
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Fallout from the Balkan conflict was the focus of the opening
day of the annual economic summit here as leaders from the most
powerful democracies debated aid for southeastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The key U.S. objective in the Helsinki talks was not to give
Russian forces control over a section of the largely Muslim
province which it might use to lever advantage for the Serb
minority, who are fellow-Slavs and primarily Christian Orthodox.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no partition here,'' said a senior White House
official traveling with President Clinton in Europe. The
administration went out of its way not to gloat over its success in
the talks even while pointing out that the key NATO aim of unified
command under alliance control was maintained.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel quite good about this,'' Clinton said near midnight
outside the imposing Cologne cathedral. ``I think it will work.''
Clinton was told of the agreement as he attended a summit-opening
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was announced in the Finnish capital by Defense
Secretary William Cohen and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
and their Russian counterparts, Marshall Igor Sergeyev and Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
   Sergeyev refused to directly deal with questions from reporters
about why Russia had abandoned the demand of President Boris
Yeltsin for a zone of its own to police. Sergeyev said only that an
``alternative solution'' had been found.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he trusted the Russian leader to abide by the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can tell you is, every time I've had an understanding
with Boris Yeltsin he's kept it,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin is to attend the final day of the summit Sunday and then
hold a private meeting with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official said that one or two Russian battalions
will be stationed with a U.S. force at Kosovska Kamenica, one or
two Russian battalions with Germans at Malisevo and one Russian
battalion with French forces at Lausa.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. official said the White House hoped the presence of
Russian forces would convince Serbs left in Kosovo not to flee the
province.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said the Russian troops would be able to join the
peacekeeping force quickly, ``a matter of a day or two.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the Russian troops at Pristina airport, the U.S.
official said, NATO forces will oversee air traffic in and out of
the field. The surprise arrival of about 200 Russian soldiers at
the facility last weekend sparked a standoff, which led Clinton and
Yeltsin to send their military chiefs to Helsinki to negotiate the
overall Russian role in the NATO-led occupation force.
</P>
<P>
   Although NATO will lay out orders for all troops in KFOR (for
``Kosovo force``), they will be relayed to Russian forces by a
Russian commander _ a more direct NATO-to-Russia command
arrangement than is used in the Russian peacekeeping force in
Bosnia-Herzegovina, where the alliance also is in charge.
</P>
<P>
   At one point Friday, Cohen said he was prepared to leave the
talks without a final agreement. But late in the afternoon the U.S.
defense chief postponed a trip to NATO headquarters in Brussels,
Belgium, to remain in the Finnish capital and press the agreement
to completion.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Sergeyev at one point in the day said a final deal
might have to be put off until the meeting Sunday between Clinton
and Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day, Clinton and other leaders, gathered by the
Rhine for their annual session, awaited a breakthrough in the
Helsinki talks.
</P>
<P>
   Decrying the ``wholesale slaughter'' in Kosovo being revealed as
Serb troops withdraw and NATO forces move in, Clinton expressed
concern about any missteps in the days ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not make any decisions which will in any way, shape or
form undermine the ability of the Kosovars or the willingness of
the Kosovars to come home,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair said that only now was the
``full horror'' coming to light and further justifying NATO's
78-day bombardment.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the daunting task of rebuilding Kosovo that lies ahead,
Clinton expressed confidence that a multi-ethnic society could be
established in the heavily Muslim province of what remains of the
former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing,'' Clinton said, ``is to get the truth out
and make all the people safe.''
</P>
<P>
   As he arrived in Cologne for the summit session, Russian Prime
Minister Sergei Stepashin warned that his nation, which has
longstanding ties with Serbia, wanted an even-handed approach to
peacekeeping in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``There must be no double-standard approach toward the
settlement of the situation when some (ethnic Albanian) refugees
are coming back home while others have to flee their places,''
Stepashin said of the large number of ethnic Serbs who are leaving
Kosovo. ``If there is a peace, it should be a peace for all.'' The
White House would not comment on renewed reports that Clinton has
signed an order directing the CIA to attempt to destabilize
Milosevic's government. But Berger did little to discourage
speculation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been supporting the opposition of President Milosevic
quite openly for some time _ independent media, opposition
parties,'' Berger said. ``And I would expect that would only
intensify.''
</P>
<P>
   The summit leaders have reached basic agreement on the design,
but not the cost, of a post-war reconstruction package for Kosovo
and southeastern Europe. The key points are:
</P>
<P>
   _ A short-term aid package for Kosovo, to provide food and
housing for returning refugees and immediate repairs to roads and
other components of the infrastructure battered by Serb forces and
the NATO bombardment. A determination of the exact amount needed
was left until the growing scope of damage can be assessed. Berger
called for a conference of donor nations ``as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   _ A longer-term rebuilding program, including reconstruction of
a civil society, including the creation of a police force and
holding of local elections.
</P>
<P>
   _ An even more expansive, and possibly more expensive, program
to aid the poorer Balkan nations, especially those that cooperated
with NATO during the air strikes by accepting refugees and basing
of NATO forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frontline states'' such as Albania and Macedonia ``in many
ways carried the heaviest burdens of this war,'' in which their
economies and fragile democracies were strained, said Clinton's
national security adviser, Samuel Berger. ``We now have a very
serious obligation to try to help them build a broader future.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In other developments at the annual meeting, leaders:
</P>
<P>
   _ Approved a proposal that could dramatically reduce the
government debt strangling hope of economic growth in many of the
poorest nations. Funding would require the International Monetary
Fund to sell gold reserves, a move that could not go forward
without congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
   _ Backed a series of steps to require better government
financial reporting and regulation, in a bid to stave off future
fiscal crises such as the economic slide in eastern Asia three
years ago.

EXPERTS WAGE A WAR OF WORDS OVER THE ROLE OF DISSENT IN ROMAN
CATHOLIC THEOLOGY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Canada)   By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two years ago, Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston denounced the
Catholic Theological Society of America, the nation's leading
professional society of Roman Catholic theologians, as ``a
wasteland'' for its criticism of official church teaching.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Avery Dulles, an elder statesman of Catholic theology
and an outspoken supporter of the papacy and its policies, later
seconded the judgment, wondering in print whether church
authorities could even ``recognize the CTSA as Catholic.''
</P>
<P>
   Dulles' opinion, issued after he had read the proceedings of the
society's 1997 convention, was sharply challenged by officers of
the CTSA and other theologians. But no one disputed his conclusion
that the gap between the theological community and Catholic
authorities revealed ``severe fault lines in contemporary American
Catholicism.''
</P>
<P>
   Not just American Catholicism, one might add. Cardinal Joseph
Ratzinger, the Vatican's custodian of doctrinal orthodoxy, has
declared war on the church's theologians for some years now. Of
course, tension is inevitable between the religious authorities
responsible for preserving their faith's tenets and theologians
trained to probe life's knottiest questions, and there will always
be some theologians whose speculations cannot be reconciled with
the tradition.
</P>
<P>
   But what does it mean for a church when high officials perceive
those trained to explicate the faith as, in fact, prime threats to
it? It is rather like an airline that accuses its pilots of
deliberately trying to crash the planes.
</P>
<P>
   One sign that this dysfunctional state of affairs is not
immutable was the presence of Dulles himself at the podium of the
latest convention of the Catholic Theological Society of America,
held last weekend in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   He was there to engage in an extended public dialogue on ``The
Nature and Authority of Doctrine'' with the Rev. Richard A.
McCormick, a theologian of equal stature, who has repeatedly
contended that the Vatican has short-circuited theological
discussion in an effort to shore up an unpersuasive teaching on
contraception and related sexual issues.
</P>
<P>
   Their exchange was part of the meeting's general theme:
development of doctrine. For centuries, theories of doctrinal
development have been offered to explain how the church could come
to promulgate beliefs not explicitly stated in Scripture or taught
in apostolic times while still remaining faithful to what was
revealed in Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   But the subtext of the two theologians' exchange was the
legitimacy of dissent from official teaching as part of the process
of doctrinal development. The two men, both Jesuit priests, shared
considerable common ground, including knowledge of the traditional
set of categories used to analyze church pronouncements.
</P>
<P>
   Dulles, for instance, did not deny that dissent was sometimes
justified, but it should be ``rare, reluctant and respectful,'' he
said. His stance was clearly developed against the backdrop of
contemporary culture _ a post-Christian, secular culture, he called
it, that puts ``extreme pressure on the church'' and that will
wield an ``enormous influence'' over theologians unless it is
resisted.
</P>
<P>
   McCormick agreed that official teaching should enjoy the
presumption of truth and that dissenting views should not be
presented as though on an equal footing with the authorized ones.
</P>
<P>
   But dissent is nonetheless essential, he said, if the church is
to correct its errors and develop its doctrines, especially ``when
the church is irresponsible and authoritarian.'' McCormick's stance
was also developed against a particular backdrop _ what he
described as a Vatican pattern of composing official documents
behind closed doors and raising particular schools of thought into
the universal norm for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Are the unity of the church and the credibility of its teachings
imperiled by public theological dissent, as Dulles warned? Or are
they even more imperiled by a refusal to alter an untenable
teaching, as McCormick suggested?
</P>
<P>
   After a dozen or more other theologians added their own comments
and questions, Margaret O'Gara, a theologian from University of St.
Michael's College in Toronto, summed up much of the discussion:
Both speakers regarded authority as a gift, she said, but two areas
of difference kept coming up:
</P>
<P>
   One was how much significance ought to be given to the actual
faith and convictions of the whole church, and not just its
governing ranks. The other was how large a place should be given to
past errors or reversals, to changes over the centuries or even
official apologies for past evils, when theologians embark on
analyzing the development of doctrine and the role of dissent.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting did not dodge examples of past teachings that have
been reversed or disavowed, however difficult they make it to
portray doctrinal development as a relatively seamless process.
</P>
<P>
   The use of coercion to suppress heresy, the official defense of
slavery, widespread teachings about Jews and Judaism, the doctrine
of ``no salvation outside the church,'' the medieval prohibition of
lending money at interest, all these and more were the hard cases
that came up in the course of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Several speakers proposed new theories that might accommodate
even these dramatic changes without abandoning the church's claim
to be a trustworthy teacher of constant doctrine. Most of the
theories seemed to win a moderate interest, none of them a clear
acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   A consensus appeared stronger, however, when it came to
suggestions about the kind of virtues Catholic theologians needed
in addressing these issues: truthfulness, civility, courage,
prudence, humility before the tradition, willingness to correct
one's colleagues and a deep-down trust in the church's future.
</P>
<P>
   As the meeting wound down, Dulles himself seemed satisfied that
these virtues had been well represented.

CECIL MORGAN, LEADER OF LOUISIANA GROUP THAT IMPEACHED HUEY LONG,
DIES AT 100  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La., Ala. )   By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cecil Morgan, a leader of the group of Louisiana state
legislators that impeached but failed to convict the popular and
populist demagogue Gov. Huey P. Long in 1929, died last Monday at
his home in New Orleans. He was 100.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan and other state legislators who were alarmed by Long's
attacks against the Standard Oil Co. and other major corporations
first began to consider the possibility of impeachment after Long
tried to impose a tax of 5 cents a barrel on oil refined in
Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   The group, called The Dynamite Squad because it sought to
explode Long's legislative proposals, accused him of trying to
arrange the murder of a political opponent, bribing lawmakers,
carrying concealed weapons and demolishing the governor's mansion
without authorization.
</P>
<P>
   When the governor's defenders learned that his enemies were
about to bring a motion to impeach before the House, they prepared
to defeat it by calling for adjournment.
</P>
<P>
   Advised of this strategy, the pro-impeachment faction developed
a counterattack. Morgan would give the House an affidavit in which
one of Long's former bodyguards would swear that the governor had
asked him to kill J.Y. Sanders, a leader of the opposition. The
accusation would be so scandalous, they thought, that the House
could not simply sweep it under the rug and adjourn. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was a tense moment when the two sides came face to face in
the chamber. All but 3 of the 100 members were present.
</P>
<P>
   Just as a Long supporter rose to move for adjournment, Morgan
leaped to his feet and waved the affidavit. ``Gov. Long offered him
money and immunity if he would assassinate Rep. J.Y. Sanders!''
Morgan shouted.
</P>
<P>
   Almost simultaneously, a Long supporter moved to adjourn.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-Long speaker recognized only the member who moved to
adjourn, but Morgan kept demanding an investigation of the charges.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker ordered Morgan to be seated, but Morgan refused and
kept talking.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker then called to the sergeant at arms: ``Put Morgan in
his seat!'' But the sergeant's way was blocked by members of the
Dynamite Squad.
</P>
<P>
   organ, his face pale with emotion, started down the center aisle
toward the podium. The House was in an uproar.
</P>
<P>
   When Morgan reached the podium, supporters surrounded him and
locked arms to shield him from the sergeant.
</P>
<P>
   The speaker called for an immediate vote on the motion to
adjourn, and when the lights on the mechanical voting machine
indicated that it had passed, the speaker slammed down his gavel
and hurriedly left the chamber.
</P>
<P>
   This prompted outrage. Almost everyone was shouting, and several
members climbed on their desks. Others hurled insults and were soon
throwing punches.
</P>
<P>
   After a few minutes of brawling, order was restored and the
members agreed that since the voting machine was probably defective
they would reconvene the next morning. At that time, Morgan again
called for an investigation while others formally demanded
impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   A trial was held and eventually the House voted to impeach Long
on eight counts. The governor, however, persuaded the necessary
number of members of the state senate to vow that they would never
convict him. That ended the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan left the Legislature in 1934 after being elected a judge
in Shreveport. Two years later, he went to work for Standard Oil as
general counsel.
</P>
<P>
   He left Standard Oil in 1963 to become dean of the Tulane
University law school, a position he held for five years.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan is survived by a son, Cecil Jr., of Birmingham, Ala.; a
daughter, Margaret Morgan Harbison of New York City; six
grandchildren; five great-grandchildren, and one

 &HT;    'It seems like we've arrived'
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Women's soccer is a mere blip on the
radar screen of the world's biggest sport, which still struggles to
gain a mainstream footing in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But the voracious American appetite for big sporting events,
plus the emergence of women's team sports after the 1996 Olympics,
has dovetailed into optimism that the third Women's World Cup can
help scale both barriers.
</P>
<P>
   Today's opening matches will be played to full houses. But
realizing FIFA President Sepp Blatter's declaration that ``the
future of football is feminine'' figures to be a considerable
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this is happening in the right place and at the
right time,'' Denmark coach Jorgen Hvidemose said. ``We just really
believed in the tournament,'' said Marla Messing, a leading
executive of the men's World Cup '94 committee who is president and
chief executive officer of the Women's World Cup. ``In 1994, people
thought we were crazy, that we couldn't fill the stadiums or
interest the American public. But this country gets up for big
events.''
</P>
<P>
   And the American proclivity for loving winners doesn't hurt,
either. At a Wednesday news conference at a New York City hotel,
almost all the snippets in a promotional video were of the U.S.
team. Apparently, little footage exists of the others, including
defending champion Norway, one of the favorites with the U.S. and
China. ``The demands have been a burden for this team to a point,
but you can't do much about it,'' U.S. coach Tony DiCicco said.
``That's just where the sport is. We're trying to be a seed for the
other countries.''
</P>
<P>
   The present scenario is a far cry from the ``seven or so''
people U.S. midfielder Michelle Akers recalls greeting the U.S.
women at John F. Kennedy Airport in the fall of 1991 when they
brought back the first World Cup trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were excited about where the game was at that point,'' said
Akers, who had 10 goals in that tournament in China. ``Even now, it
seems like we've arrived, but there still remains so much to be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the success of this World Cup depends on the results of
the U.S. team. Months before the draw, the U.S. schedule was
already filled in, placing the Americans in six of the seven venues
_ if they reach the finals _ to maximize ticket sales and media
interest across the country.
</P>
<P>
   If they trip, no Plan B has been revealed for what would be a
severe drop in attendance and ratings. But an upset of America
might do wonders in the rest of the world, where soccer is
considered a macho sport.
</P>
<P>
   The respected ``Encyclopedia of Football,'' a hefty 648 pages
thick, contains just one page on the entire subject of women's
soccer, and that's limited to the two previous World Cup and the
1996 Olympic competitions.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil, Germany and Italy are the exceptions among the
powerhouse nations in men's soccer in developing women's teams.
Because of liberal social attitudes toward women in Scandinavia,
Norway, Sweden and Denmark have been established for at least two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Even in England, which lauds itself as the ``home of football,''
a full-time women's coach was appointed for the first time only
last year, right after the national team finished last in its World
Cup qualifying group.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, playing in its first World Cup, began its women's team
last year, and nearly half of its players were raised in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Defender Susy Mora, who grew up in Los Angeles and plays at
Southern Cal, said perceptions about women playing soccer are
unspoken in her parents' homeland, but she knows that the cultural
belief is that they don't fit in. Not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't hear them say that, but you can feel it,'' Mora said.
``It's starting to change, but we have to do well here and work
hard to keep this going.''

TEXAS POLITICAL GIANT LEFT LASTING MARK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Legendary, great and grand. Gritty and
iron-fisted.
</P>
<P>
   Visionary and courageous. Rowdy and raucous.
</P>
<P>
   Vesuvian.
</P>
<P>
   Stubbornly independent, sometimes loved and other times loathed.
</P>
<P>
   Giant among Texas leaders and passionate lover of all things
Texan.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians and state leaders all across Texas struggled Friday
to describe the essence of former Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, who died at
home Friday at the age of 69 just five months after retiring from
four decades of public service.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no words big enough to capture Bob Bullock,'' said
Gov. George W. Bush. ``Bob Bullock was the largest Texan of our
time, as great and grand as the state he loved. Almost everything
about modern Texas bears his imprint ... from the water we drink to
the schools and universities that educate our children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to put in words how I feel,'' Bush added. ``I'm sad
and I feel like I really lost a great friend.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the two ``wept together'' when they visited the night
before his death, tears that were shed, in part, over Bullock's
publicly expressed desire to see Bush elected president. ``He told
me to go win,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Former Houston Mayor Bob Lanier, who had been friends with
Bullock for more than a quarter of a century, described him this
way:
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anything else, he was just a man. He was kind of the
total man. The person that loved Texas, the guy who lived a rowdy
and raucous life and then straightened up, the guy who'd get
knocked down and then back up and come to the fray. A smart guy. A
guy who got things done. But then all but none of those. It's just
kind of the aggregate image of Bob Bullock as a bigger-than-life
leader.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, who succeeded Bullock at the
helm of the Texas Senate in January, said Bullock ``loved Texas
with every fiber of his iron fist and kind heart.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bob Bullock I knew was a kind-hearted, compassionate and
gentle man,'' Perry added. ``Texas is, and always will be, a better
and stronger place because of him. ... He truly broke the mold and
there will never be another Texas leader like him.''
</P>
<P>
   He was as infamous for his mercurial temper _ which often left
employees and other elected officials quaking _ as he was for his
heavy-handed, back-door deal-making in the Senate, a double-edged
sword that left some folks grumbling they'd been left out of the
process while also getting legislation passed.
</P>
<P>
   So forceful of a leader was Bullock, that his death had some
pondering whether the familiar ``God Bless Texas'' refrain that
punctuated the end of his speeches wasn't more of an order than a
personal prayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that when he said that he was not just suggesting that
God (should) bless Texas but that God already had,'' chuckled
fellow Democrat and former Attorney General Jim Mattox.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock's death undoubtedly will lead to embellishments of his
prowess and power, Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, countered Republican Sen. David Sibley of Waco, whose
grin and recollection of having been at the receiving end of
Bullock's temper a time or two suggested there would be no need to
embellish any tales.
</P>
<P>
   ``He never pretended to be anything he wasn't,'' Lanier said.
``If he had a wart he'd show it to you and then brag his was bigger
than yours.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Bullock became well known in his later years for
publicly acknowledging his personal foibles, from his struggle with
alcoholism to his multiple marriages.
</P>
<P>
   In 1979 he issued a press release about his pending hemorrhoid
surgery, stating that he would not display surgical scars, which he
was certain ``nosey'' members of the Capitol press corps would want
to see.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was smart, he was rowdy and you know he could be raucous,''
Lanier said. ``But he loved this state and the state loved him
back.''
</P>
<P>
   He was as effective a politician as Texas has even known, others
chimed in, and deft at maneuvering people into compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Bullock was one of the great characters in Texas
history,'' said Robert B. Sloan Jr., president of Baylor
University, where Bullock received his law degree in 1958. ``In
fact, he was a master at striking deals, finding common ground and
making coalitions with very different kinds of people. He was
powerful in the best sense of the word. He knew power and was not
afraid to wield it, yet he used it for the benefit of all Texans.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor Chancellor Herbert H. Reynolds, whose friendship with
Bullock dates back to their days in the Air Force, said Bullock
also made a lasting contribution to Baylor, the state ``and even
our nation as one of the most unique and strongest leaders of our
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Garza, chairman of the Railroad Commission, said Bullock
ranks with the greatest leaders in Texas history and called him
``the gold standard for public service.''
</P>
<P>
   ``(Sam) Houston, (Stephen F.) Austin, (President) Johnson and
(Sam) Rayburn better make room at the table for Bullock,'' Garza
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was Vesuvian and seemingly contradictory, but always
passionate about his love for Texas,'' Garza added.
</P>
<P>
   One of those seeming contradictions occurred in 1993. A
supporter of women's rights, Bullock angered some women when he
suggested that Sen. Judith Zaffirini, D-El Paso, could be more
effective in passing legislation if she ``cut her skirt off about
six inches and put on some high heels.''
</P>
<P>
   Zaffirrini said she wasn't bothered by his comment because she
took it for the teasing he intended it and that his actions _
appointing her to important committees _ spoke more.
</P>
<P>
   And he once told her, during some intense negotiations on a
higher education bill, that she was ``so mean (she) made his second
wife look good.''
</P>
<P>
   Zaffirini said she would much rather have been the object of
Bullock's teasing than his wrath, something with which she, too,
was familiar. Her strategy for dealing with those scoldings stemmed
from a survival tactic she had learned from admonishments of the
principal, Mother Andrew, at Ursala Academy, where she attended
high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd look him in the eye and just keep saying to myself, `Yes,
Mother Andrew. No, Mother Andrew. Whatever you say, Mother
Andrew,''' Zaffirini said.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock's death brought kind words from one of his most ardent
enemies during his early days in state government, former Lt. Gov.
Ben Barnes, who blocked Bullock's appointment to the then-Board of
Insurance and sparked intensely personal feuding between the two
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``For over 40 years, Bob gave himself, his energy and his soul
to the leadership of this state,'' Barnes said. ``I, as all Texans,
am grateful to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Charming, highly energetic, and sometimes volcanic in his
language, Bush said Bullock's success was based in large part on
his unpredictable personality.
</P>
<P>
   And he was vintage Bullock till the end. Describing the Democrat
as ``lucid and funny'' and aware of those around him when Bush
visited the Bullock home Thursday evening, Bush said: ``He was
Bullock. He was battling to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mattox and several other leaders said they have no doubt
that wherever Bullock is now he probably already is taking charge
and barking orders.
</P>
<P>
   Should weather turn foul during memorial services Sunday and a
crash of thunder punctuate graveside ceremonies, it most likely is
a sign, Mattox said, ``Bullock's probably already got his gavel
working there.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Billie Carr, a longtime Bullock friend and Democratic Party
stalwart in Houston: ``Wherever he is, he's probably saying, `This
place is in a helluva mess and it needs to be organized.' I suspect
wherever he is, it will have to be redone.''

URI BACKS AWAY FROM ODOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lamar Odom's basketball career has taken several dramatic twists
and turns since he enrolled at the University of Rhode Island two
years ago. Now it appears URI has brought its role in the sophomore
sensation's ever-changing story to a close.
</P>
<P>
   In a Friday, URI officials said they will not seek restoration
of Odom's eligibility, voided when the forward from Queens, N.Y.,
made himself eligible for the NBA draft a month ago and
subsequently signed with an agent.
</P>
<P>
   URI's move Friday reverses the school's announcement on Thursday
that it would petition the NCAA to have Odom's eligibility
restored. And that followed an announcement on Wednesday by URI
coach Jerry DeGregorio that Odom was staying in the draft pool but
had merely sought new representation.
</P>
<P>
   Under NCAA rules, underclassmen players who sign with agents
forfeit their eligibility. But Odom, after participating in a
workout with the Vancouver Grizzlies, began expressing interest in
returning to school and subsequently severed ties with agent Jeff
Klein on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In Friday's statement, URI officials said they agreed to help
Odom petition the NCAA prepare his petition and make the request
for eligibility ``if it is determined that the facts and
circumstances were sufficient to warrant taking such action.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The university conducted this review within this week and it
has determined that the facts did not justify going forward with
the request,'' the statement went on to say. ``As a result, the
university will not file a request for restoration of his
eligibility.''
</P>
<P>
   URI athletic director Ron Petro said in the statement, ``Due to
the high profile of this student athlete, we made every effort to
review this matter carefully. Lamar was a major reason for our
success last season and we wish him well as he moves to the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Odom was also quoted in the statement, saying, ``I have great
memories of my time at URI. I want to thank all the URI fans for
their support. In many ways, this has been the best year of my
life. Coach (Jerry) DeGregorio, the rest of the coaching staff, Ron
Petro and everyone at URI has made me feel at home. It has been
time that I'll never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the events surrounding Odom will affect his draft status
remains to be seen. He has been projected as a top-10 pick and
missed a scheduled workout with the Chicago Bulls, who have the
first overall pick in the draft.

WEALTHIEST NATIONS AGREE TO BILLIONS IN DEBT RELIEF FOR POOREST
NATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOGNE, Germany _ Leaders from the Group of Seven wealthiest
nations agreed Friday to cut the debt burden of the world's poorest
countries in what they described as a decisive push to alleviate
poverty.
</P>
<P>
   President Jacques Chirac of France said the relief for mainly
African countries could total about $65 billion. But Gene Sperling,
the national economic adviser to President Clinton, said the amount
could approach $90 billion if other creditors join the initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Some loans would be canceled outright, and mechanisms would be
put in place to evaluate other debt relief, tied to economic
reforms in the indebted countries in future years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If other countries were to share in this effort, then a full
70 percent of the $127 billion owed by qualifying states could be
relieved,'' Sperling said. He estimated that 33 countries could
benefit, including Ethiopia, Niger, Nicaragua, Tanzania, Uganda,
Ghana, Rwanda and Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
   Some charitable organizations have argued for more debt
forgiveness, but the lenders oppose setting a precedent of wiping
out all of a lender's debt.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the United States, Britain, France, Germany,
Italy, Canada and Japan said the resources made available by the
debt relief should be used for health and educational programs,
particularly AIDS programs in Africa. Congress would be asked to
approve some elements of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came on the first day of a three-day summit here
devoted largely to Kosovo and the troubled relations with Moscow
resulting from the Kosovo War. The Russian prime minister, Sergei
Stepashin, joined the seven leaders after their debt discussions,
and President Boris Yeltsin is expected Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, the U.S. national security adviser, said the debt
relief plan would have ``an enormous impact on poorer countries,
perhaps more than any other single action taken by the developed
countries at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   But the reality seemed rather more uncertain. Similar promises
in the past have proved agonizingly slow in application. Many of
the affected states are unable to meet their debts in any event, so
they will not abruptly find themselves with more money. And without
stable governance, the impact of debt relief on society may be
slight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are demonstrating we are active and concerned, but unless
we really invest in establishing civil society in these countries,
we may be pouring water into sand,'' Norbert Walter, the chief
economist at Deutsche Bank, said. ``Opening agricultural markets in
Europe and the United States might have provided more real help to
these states.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the decision clearly reflected a sense of urgency born of
the realization that a program of debt relief for the poorest
countries set in motion in 1996 had proved too limited, stringent
and slow-moving for the more than 400 million people potentially
affected.
</P>
<P>
   Under the extended plan announced Friday, the Group of Seven
countries will cancel between $15 billion and $20 billion of
official development assistance debt _ money lent on easy terms.
</P>
<P>
   Chirac said that members of the Group of 7 would bear the cost
of debt relief equitably among themselves; the International
Monetary Fund and World Bank, whose main shareholders are the
wealthy nations, made most of the lending, for development.
</P>
<P>
   Further relief will be provided by international financial
institutions like the IMF and by forgiving trade debts backed by
government guarantees. Businesses that have made loans to
qualifying states will also be asked to make similar concessions.
</P>
<P>
   In general, the criteria for qualifying for relief will be eased
and the procedure accelerated, allowing a current list of 26
countries that had secured debt cuts under the 1996 plan to be
expanded to 33 states. The newly qualified nations include Benin,
Ghana, Honduras, Laos and Senegal.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Sperling took the example of Mozambique, which is about to
qualify for relief under the plan, to illustrate its effectiveness,
suggesting that the 30 percent of the country's resources that is
currently used for debt service would be cut to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would free up $30 million of debt service per year,
allowing the health budget to be increased by 50 percent,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Oxfam, one of several charitable organizations that has been
lobbying for more sweeping debt relief, said in a statement that
even with the new measures, Mozambique would be paying twice as
much a year in debt as for primary education.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   What seems clear is that unless they are accompanied by
determined programs for the relief of poverty, the establishment of
the rule of law and sharply improved standards of government, the
measures are unlikely to have a significant impact in Africa, the
continent principally targeted.
</P>
<P>
   The plan would be financed to a small degree by the possible
sale of close to 10 perkent of the gold reserves of the IMF Earlier
discussions of such a move by finance ministers worried some
traders who believe the price of gold could be further depressed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The leaders said the IMF should finance the program partly
through ``use of interest on the proceeds of a limited and
cautiously phased sale of up to 10 million ounces of the IMF's gold
reserves.''
</P>
<P>
   Those sales have to be approved by Congress and the IMF itself.
At current prices, they would yield about $2.8 billion, providing a
portion of the whole program.
</P>
<P>
   Turning from the world's poorest regions to the general state of
the world economy, the leaders approved a six-point plan aimed at
stabilizing world financial markets in the wake of the contagious
crises that spread through Asia, Russia and Latin America in 1997
and last year.
</P>
<P>
   The measures fell short of many of the more radical proposals
made since the dangers of a fast-moving globalized economy became
evident. These had included regulating hedge funds, introducing
forms of capital control and vastly increasing the powers of the
IMF.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the leaders decided to create a so-called Financial
Stability Forum bringing together international regulators and
authorities from the Group of Seven; provide new IMF credit lines
to protect developing countries with sound policies; increase the
standards demanded of governments and financial institutions;
impose capital charges on banks that better reflect the risk of
lending, and prepare programs for rapid IMF and World Bank support
of the most needy in any future crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world has proved crazy of late,'' President Chirac said,
alluding to Kosovo and the financial crises in the same breath.
``We are taking measures to create a world that is more stable,
more generous and more courageous.''
</P>
<P>
   His words reflected a sort of millennium fever that seemed to
infect the leaders as they proclaimed the arrival of a braver, new
world. The relief at the end of the fighting in Kosovo and, late in
the day, at an accord on a Russian troop deployment with the NATO
forces in the province was palpable.
</P>
<P>
   But President Clinton was obliged to deal with a mundane and
contentious reality in a meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi. Although the president proclaimed himself ``thrilled'' with
Japan's surprisingly strong first-quarter economic performance, he
warned of sharp tensions over United States imports of Japanese
steel.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has threatened to impose quotas on the Japanese steel
industry, and Obuchi expressed concern at what he called the
``growing protectionist sentiment'' in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton told Obuchi that steel imports, which have recently
declined somewhat, would have to drop further and said that he
might not be able to prevent a congressional imposition of quotas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point that was made to the prime minister was that they
need to get their imports down to pre-crisis levels because this is
a bill that he may not be able to sustain a veto on,'' said Joe
Lockhart, the presidential spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   After the Asian financial crisis curtailed Japanese steel
exports to its neighbors, Japan's exports to the United States
soared to four million tonnes last year from 2.8 million tonnes in
1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
   GROUP A
</P>
<P>
   DENMARK, NIGERIA, N. KOREA, UNITED STATES
</P>
<P>
   The Americans have a relatively easy group. Their toughest match
should be today's opener against Denmark, a respectable club but
not in the same league with Scandinavian rival Norway. Mia Hamm,
Tiffeny Milbrett and Cindy Parlow are unparalleled up front, but
the U.S. team has been suspect to teams with equal skill and speed,
especially on the counterattack. Nigeria has great individual skill
and flair at some positions, especially from forward ``Marvelous''
Mercy Akide. Nigeria beat China in a closed-door match earlier this
week, but it does not have enough experience. North Korea is in the
World Cup for the first time and has given China a good challenge
occasionally.
</P>
<P>
   Pick: United States, Denmark advance.
</P>
<P>
   GROUP B
</P>
<P>
   BRAZIL, GERMANY, ITALY, MEXICO
</P>
<P>
   Easily the Group of Death, with Brazil and Germany possible
quarterfinal and semifinal opponents for the U.S. team. The
Brazilians never have finished better than ninth in the World Cup,
but their vast improvement started with a fourth-place finish at
the 1996 Olympics. Brazil's women are fast and skillful and should
advance easily despite a knee injury to star striker Roseli. Katia,
Sissi and Pretinha are a real treat to watch on the attack. Germany
has skill and fortitude and is led by Doris Fitschen and Steffi
Jones and midfielder Bettina Wiegmann. Italy is a team in
transition, although it still has some fine players. Mexico, with
its assortment of U.S.-raised players, many with college
experience, makes its World Cup debut.
</P>
<P>
   Pick: Brazil, Germany advance.
</P>
<P>
   GROUP C
</P>
<P>
   CANADA, JAPAN, NORWAY, RUSSIA
</P>
<P>
   Even softer than the U.S. group, this collection of teams should
be little more than tune-up fare for Norway, the defending World
Cup champion. Veteran striker Linda Medalen of Norway has been
moved into a defensive role, which is even more important because
of an injury to sweeper Gro Espeseth. The Norwegian midfielders,
led by Hege Riise, routinely dominate matches and a young infusion
of scoring talent has been added since Sweden '95. Canadian striker
Charmaine Hooper could be one of the best players in the
tournament, although the rest of her team is relatively average.
Japan is industrious and Russia is making strides, but neither has
enough to move beyond the pool stage.
</P>
<P>
   Pick: Norway, Canada advance.
</P>
<P>
   GROUP D
</P>
<P>
   AUSTRALIA, CHINA, GHANA, SWEDEN
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese should be able to run all over this group, with only
Sweden and top-flight goalkeeper Ulrika Karlsson making a nominal
challenge. With two wins against the U.S. team this year, China has
been in sensational form, and has all the tools to win the
championship. Only Hamm may be a better all-around offensive player
than Sun Wen, while veteran Liu Ailing patrols a versatile,
aggressive midfield. At 31, Gao Hong is reaching her peak in front
of the nets. Australia is trying to build a solid program as it
bids to host the 2003 World Cup. Ghana, which got in mainly because
Africa was allotted another spot when the tournament was expanded
to 16 teams, is soaking up the atmosphere for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Pick: China, Sweden advance.
</P>
<P>
   QUARTERFINAL PREDICTIONS
</P>
<P>
   United States over Germany; Brazil over Denmark; Norway over
Sweden; China over Canada.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hours after approving an amendment to loosen
restrictions on gun-show sales, the House reversed course Friday
and rejected the entire gun-control bill in an outburst of bitter
partisan sniping.
</P>
<P>
   The 280-147 vote scuttled legislation that would have required
background checks on all gun buyers at flea markets and gun shows.
In an unusual alliance, advocates on both sides of the gun control
debate teamed to keep the measure from being included in a juvenile
crime package.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control activists said the Republican-backed proposal did
not go far enough; gun rights advocates said it would place an
unnecessary burden on law-abiding gun owners.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joe Barton, R-Ennis, and Rep. Martin Frost, D-Dallas,
joined forces in opposing the gun control bill. House Majority
Leader Dick Armey of Irving and Rep. Kay Granger, R-Fort Worth,
voted for it.
</P>
<P>
   Gun-control supporters said the outcome is a tribute to the
power of the National Rifle Association, a lobbying organization
that donated $1.6 million to congressional candidates in the last
election. About 83 percent of the money went to Republicans,
according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan
group that tracks campaign spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope in my lifetime the marriage between the NRA and my
party ends in divorce,'' said Rep. Chris Shays, R-Conn., a party
maverick. ``It's a bad marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   The gun show restrictions could be revived in negotiations
between the House and Senate over the final version of the juvenile
justice bill. Because the Senate passed a youth crime bill that
includes comprehensive background checks for gun show buyers, the
House's version of juvenile-justice legislation will be sent to the
House-Senate conference committee to hammer out differences between
the measures.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, even though the House rejected its rendition of
gun control, the issue could be resurrected in the conference
committee. A compromise could conceivably be worked out, but strong
gun control legislation is unlikely because the House bill has no
such provision.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats blamed one another for not reaching a
compromise on an issue that moved to the top of the congressional
agenda after the April 20 massacre at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House leadership gutted this bill in the dead of night to
keep common-sense gun legislation from seeing the light of day,''
President Clinton said. ``The American people will not stand for
this. Our nation is waiting for Washington to pass real laws that
keep guns away from children and out of the hands of criminals.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., accused Democrats of derailing
the bill in an attempt to gain political advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let there be no mistake. The vast majority of the Democrat
caucus walked away when they had the chance to walk forward for the
good of the country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The outcome was a bitter disappointment for rank-and-file
lawmakers who had hoped that the House could put aside politics in
dealing with the recent wave of school violence.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after the vote, Granger burst through the swinging doors
from the House chamber sputtering with anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very frustrated, and I'll bet the American people are
frustrated,'' she said. ``It's who gets the vote or who doesn't get
the vote, not are we really dealing with the problem. I'm angry
about it, because it's not right. It deserves more than that.''
</P>
<P>
   The House vote capped three days of emotional debate over how to
deal with school violence and juvenile crime. In passing the
Juvenile Offenders Act late Thursday night, lawmakers endorsed a
wide range of possible solutions, including tougher penalties for
juvenile offenders, $1.5 billion in federal grants and a proposal
that would let teachers post the Ten Commandments in their
classrooms.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the sensitivity of the issue, House leaders put the
gun control proposals in a separate bill that would have been added
to the rest of the juvenile justice package if the gun bill had
passed.
</P>
<P>
   Working late into the night Thursday, lawmakers approved an
amendment backed by the NRA that would have put a 24-hour limit on
background checks at gun shows. The sale would be approved
automatically if the check had not been completed within the time
limit.
</P>
<P>
   Gun control advocates favored a 72-hour limit because most gun
shows occur on weekends, when court records are generally
unavailable. When the bill came to a final vote Friday,
background-check opponents joined gun-control advocates in
defeating it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill tried to be all things to all people and ended up
being nothing to anybody, especially our children,'' said Rep. Nick
Lampson, D-Beaumont, who opposes gun control. ``The final version
of the bill was so jelled up by numerous amendments that it would
have tied the hands of responsible gun owners.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 10 of the 207 Democrats endorsed the gun show proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world needs to know that the Democratic House minority is
not serious about protecting our nation's children. They turned
their backs on this nation's children,'' said Rep. Deborah Pryce,
R-Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats countered that 82 Republicans joined 197 Democrats in
opposing the gun control measure. Republican Whip Tom DeLay of
Sugar Land, an ardent gun control foe and arguably the most
powerful House leader, did not try to line up support for the bill
on his side of the aisle.

OVERSEAS GOVERNMENTS SAY THEY CAN HELP FILL SEATTLE'S HIGH-TECH
JOBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ARTHUR C. GORLICK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ They arrive in Seattle from places in the world as
diverse as The Netherlands, Barbados and India and they are seeking
the high-paying high-technology jobs that Seattle-area companies
can't fill.
</P>
<P>
   International trade delegations have paraded into Seattle in
recent weeks reassuring computer software developers with a common
message.
</P>
<P>
   They have skilled, trained people ready and eager to take on
work, often at low cost, that Seattle-area companies need to
complete before their customers switch to competitors, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Trade delegation leaders tell large Seattle audiences that their
government will help pave the way if only companies here set up
shop there and give jobs to their workers.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Gary Locke, in a speech to the Technology Alliance of
Washington this month, outlined much of Seattle's attraction to
these technology-savvy nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some 7,000 job openings right now in our state of
Washington in the high technology and information fields,'' Locke
told the organization whose membership includes companies forming
the economic power of the state _ Boeing, Microsoft, Immunex, Icos
and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``And yet our colleges and universities are only turning out
some 1,300 students a year with the appropriate degrees to fill
these jobs. So Washington state employers are hiring people from
out of state and out of country and (qualified Washington) students
can't get into these courses to get the degrees they need to fill
these jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Not to worry, said Deputy Mayor Pauline Krikke of Amsterdam, who
listed her city's high-tech attributes before a Seattle audience
that included representatives of several Seattle-area software
producers.
</P>
<P>
   For example: Amsterdam is considered the ``Cyber City of
Europe,'' Krikke said. Its Science Park houses 45 international
information technology companies, and a high proportion of the
Internet traffic between the United States and Europe is channeled
through Amsterdam. The government offers substantial tax breaks for
U.S. companies setting up operations there.
</P>
<P>
   Davrick Liles and Brent Willen, two of three partners who own
Bellevue's Ardent Consulting, a computer software development
company, were in the audience of almost 200 at a symposium this
week sponsored by the government of Barbados in a plush, paneled
hall at Seattle's Rainier Club.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of skilled people in the Seattle area to take on software
jobs has driven up the cost of hiring workers _ and the price
offered to clients, Liles said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us as software developers, the rate for people can be as
much as $150 an hour,'' Liles said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking for ways to lower our costs and this would
allow us to pay a lot lower and develop software in Barbados for
our clients that would be 25 percent to 30 percent lower.''
</P>
<P>
   The company will get its skilled workers and talent wherever it
can find it, Willen said.
</P>
<P>
   Reginald Farley, minister of industry and international business
for Barbados, and his staff passed out pamphlets from one company
in Barbados offering to solve the problems of the Bellevue software
developers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Are your labor costs too high? Are you looking to reduce
costs?'' the pamphlet entices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business process outsourcing can increase profitability and
productivity in your organization by strategic partnerships that
focus on core competencies.''
</P>
<P>
   The translation from cyberspeak is, ``Form a partnership with us
and send us the work you need to get done and we'll increase your
profits.''
</P>
<P>
   While Farley reminded those attending the symposium that
Barbados offers white sand beaches and comfortable living to those
moving there, it is not necessary to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of the information technology industry make distance
and international boundaries almost meaningless, he noted.
</P>
<P>
   That point was made, too, by Sergey Volkov of Seattle's
Russian-America Society, who attended a luncheon of the European
Chambers of Commerce in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia has many computer scientists and mathematicians who are
out of work because of the financial problems there,'' said Volkov,
a former Soviet Foreign Ministry official now living in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would be more than happy to do computer software work
that can be sent to them via the Internet. It could get done
without the cost of travel by some of the most capable people in
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Some local companies have already gone beyond simply setting up
sales offices abroad. Microsoft has production operations in
Ireland and India. A Bellevue company, Aditi, acts much like a
broker handling technical support for Seattle-area software
companies at its facilities in India.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, India's National Association of Software and Service
Companies and the Consulate General of India will hold business
seminars here next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``India, your software partner,'' is the headline on the
delegation's invitations and advance publicity.
</P>
<P>
   It touts India as having the second-largest number of
English-speaking scientific professionals in the world, behind only
the United states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here is a country that offers cost-effectiveness, great
quality, high reliability, rapid delivery and, above all,
state-of-the-art technologies in software development and Web-based
services,'' their literature says.
</P>
<P>
   While Washington's universities turn out 1,300 people a year to
fill computer company employee needs, India's institutions of
higher education overwhelm that.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are over 1,832 educational institutions and polytechnics
training more than 67,785 computer software professionals on an
annual basis,'' India's literature says.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage of trained people is so great here that even the
University of Washington has problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't afford them,'' said Bob Roseth, the university's
director of news and information.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to hire the computer science program's students. The
shortage affects recruitment for staff positions at the university.
You have trouble keeping people in high-tech jobs because of what's
going on in the private sector.''
</P>
<P>
   What's going on is that Washington's high-tech companies are
paying nearly $20,000 a year more than those in California to
attract employees, according to the American Electronics
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The trained employee shortage affects not only Microsoft, Locke
lamented, but banks, insurance, financial institutions and major
manufacturing in the state.

 &HT;    For us, it was a tumultuous relationship, to say the least
 &HT;    By Dave Mcneely
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ In 1974, when I was a reporter for The Dallas
Morning News, Bob Bullock and I and some of our mutual friends
killed a couple coolers of beer at Willie Nelson's Fourth of July
Picnic at Dripping Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock had just won the Democratic primary for comptroller,
after scaring the aging incumbent into retiring rather than seeking
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, I covered one of Bullock's first raids on a Dallas
restaurant that hadn't paid its sales taxes. He loved the
publicity. In later years, I had an occasional whiskey and
intriguing political talk with him at the comptroller's office,
while LBJ's bust looked on.
</P>
<P>
   He controlled a lot of people and events. State tax collector
for 16 years. Honcho of the Texas Senate for another eight. Many
folks kissed his ring.
</P>
<P>
   I called him ``Bob'' _ not ``Mr. Bullock,'' as his comptroller
employees did, and seldom ``governor'' after he became lieutenant
governor.
</P>
<P>
   Journalists shouldn't be awed of politicians. Another cog in the
apparatus of democracy, we report on them, ask tough questions. We
remind them they work for the people, put their pants on one leg at
a time like everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Bob was periodically in fights with other officials, always at
least on the edge of trouble, if not directly in it. And drunk a
lot.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, his friend Ann Richards and others helped persuade him
to go to Betty Ford's ``drunk school.'' He quit the sauce, but not
his classic alcoholic behavior _ slap and soothe, punish and
praise.
</P>
<P>
   I wrote a lot about the good things he did _ like bringing the
comptroller's office into the 20th century, instituting an
affirmative-action policy before there was even a name for it,
pushing the state to change its outmoded tax system.
</P>
<P>
   But I never admired the more-than-occasional abuses of power and
of people. I think he felt he was doing good; it didn't matter how
he got it done.
</P>
<P>
   In later years, he ended speeches with ``God Bless Texas'' _ and
he meant it. But even while I wrote of Bob's accomplishments, the
hypersensitive, perfectionist control freak didn't like attention
to his dark side.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1988, he was oiling up his political machine to run
for lieutenant governor in 1990. I warned Texans there were two Bob
Bullocks:
</P>
<P>
   ``The good Bob Bullock is a caring, decent, loyal human being,
with a strong sense of democracy. He thinks government should serve
the people and search for new and innovative ways to deliver the
most services to taxpayers for the least amount of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will be up at all hours of the night, dictating memos and
otherwise trying to figure out ways to make things run better. He
will be a stern taskmaster to make sure that government efficiently
helps those who can't help themselves and doesn't hurt those who
can.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad Bob Bullock is mean, arrogant, sometimes petty,
impetuous, mercurial, bullying. He sometimes carries loyalty to the
point of keeping people around who shouldn't be, while making life
so miserable for people who should be that they figure they'd
rather work somewhere else.'' In 1994, he had a heart attack a few
weeks before the election. Had surgery. I wrote a column about how
the lieutenant governor's job, and ballot slot, would be filled if
Bullock didn't survive the operation.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, 35 minutes into an interview about his extensive
network of former employees scattered throughout Texas government,
Bullock suddenly boiled over.
</P>
<P>
   The 1994 column, he said, was ``the most callous disregard . . .
the most irresponsible act, that I have ever known.'' Said I'd
scared his wife.
</P>
<P>
   After several minutes more of what others told me was the
classic Bullock butt-chewing, he said:
</P>
<P>
   ``You ain't up here to write a story. You're up here to gut my
ass. And that's the way I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that was clear.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this same man, when my late wife and fellow journalist
Carole Kneeland's breast cancer got worse, told me his plane was
available, any time, to fly her to M.D. Anderson Cancer Treatment
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in 1994, another column ended by asking what he'd like
carved on his tombstone.
</P>
<P>
   ``That `He did the best he could, and he loved his state' _
because I do,'' Bullock said. ``I love this state, and I love its
people _ almost an obsession with me. But I don't see anything
wrong with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Me, neither _ you crusty old hard-ass. Godspeed, Governor
Bullock.

<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ Competition? What competition?
</P>
<P>
   David Duval is in at 67-70-137. Phil Mickelson is in at
67-70-137. They share the U.S. Open second-round lead with Mr.
Knickers, Payne Stewart. They also shared a lot of time together,
having been playing partners for the first two days.
</P>
<P>
   But they weren't, you know, in ITALICS competition. END ITALICS.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' said Mickelson, ``it's the second round. I feel, and I
think David feels, that we all know even par tends to win the U.S.
Open. The idea is to get a few shots in hand before the weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' echoed Duval. ``Not at all. I felt if I could just keep
hanging out where I was, things would sort themselves out. This was
not a day to worry about one-on-one competition with anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   OK, guys, have it your way. Say the reasonable and intelligent
thing. Confirm the intellectually obvious. Sure, we know that a
little BEGIN ITALICS mano a mano END ITALICS thing on Friday won't
be remembered much by Sunday at around 7 o'clock (or perhaps even
Monday if we have a not exactly unprecedented playoff). But for the
people who watched these two under-30 contenders for the title of
Best Player Never To Have Won A Major (BPNTHWAM) wage concurrent
battles against Pinehurst Number 2 these past two days, it was
impossible not to frame their little confrontation in terms of
one-on-one.
</P>
<P>
   Can't help it, guys. That's just the way we are.
</P>
<P>
   Duval went out in a one-under 34 and came back in a one-over 36.
``I feel very positive,'' he said, considering that the course was
a lot more difficult (Friday), and I didn't play as well, but
somehow managed to shoot even par.'' His adventurous front nine
included four birdies, a bogey and a double bogey. That took place
on the 222-yard par 3 sixth hole, when his second shot flew out of
a bunker on the right side clear past the green.
</P>
<P>
   But he demonstrated a little bit of the reason why he has
already won $2,861,350 on the tour this year when he responded to
that double bogey with back-to-back birdies. On the 398-yard
seventh he nailed a 9-iron three feet from the pin. He likewise
birdied the 485-yard par 4 eighth by following up a nice 7-iron
with a 14-foor putt.
</P>
<P>
   Informed that he leads the tour in the ``bounce-back'' category,
he scratched his head. ``I don't know what the `bounce-back' stat
is,'' he shrugged. ``I think the reason I can do that, is that I
really don't care. I just keep going. If I have a bad six, I say,
`I've got to play seven now.' It's just one of the 18 scores you're
going to have for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson had a classically circuitous route to his 36-34-70. He
was Mr. Up and Down, continually salvaging pars with superb
artistry on the side of, below and in back of the treacherous
Number 2 greens. He also was called upon for three spectacular
recoveries after slightly errant tee shots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really pleased with the opportunity that this golf course
presents,'' pointed out the 29-year old King of Southpaws. ``If I
or another player misses a shot, we have an opportunity to hit a
great recovery and get up-and-down.''
</P>
<P>
   He was thinking more of his up-and-down work around the greeen,
which speaks to just how amazing these guys really are. Not to take
anything away from his short game, but anyone watching him play
might have been more taken with his dramatic rcoveries from
roadsides, or in front of TV trucks, or in close quarters with a
hundred people within a foot of his backswing. To him, that's like,
``What's the big deal?''
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson is not quite Duval in the golfing public's eye. He's
more than $2,200,000 behind him on this year's money list, for one
thing (not that you need plan running a benefit for any of the
marquess guys). But he is a star. He has won more career
tournaments (13-11), and he's been in the public consciousness
longer. Five years ago casual sports fans knew Phil Mickelson. Only
the hard core golfing afficionados knew David Duval.
</P>
<P>
   If he appears to be playing in a blissful state in this Open,
there are two reasons. The first is his confidence, especially in
his short game. In preparation for Pinehurst, he spent time with
noted guru Jackie Burke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have not worked on my short game for the past few years, and
it has deteriorated,'' he admitted. ``I've worked hard the past few
months, and I feel it's as good as it's been in years. I don't feel
I have to hit every shot perfect. I feel like there is enough
margin of error where my short game can make up for it.''
</P>
<P>
   The second reason is that wife Amy is back home awaiting the
birth of a baby. The due date is June 30, but, hey, you never know.
Mickelson says the decision has been made: If caddy Jim Mackey gets
a call on the beeper saying it's time for you-know-what, Mickelson
says he's outta here, even if he's putting for the championship on
number 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not something I worry about,'' he said. ``The decision
has been made.''
</P>
<P>
   Duval's got no sub-plot to match that. With him it's just a
matter of making those pars and allowing everyone else to
self-destruct. As for being the BPNTHWAM, the leading money winner
said that doesn't bother him. ``You only get four chances a year to
win one,'' he said, ``and you'd better hope you're playing well
when they come along.''
</P>
<P>
   It shouldn't be an issue. The guy is only 27.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, there wasn't any competition. They may have each pulled
out drivers for their second shots on the monstrous 610-yard tenth,
but let's not read anything into that.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever.

LEGENDARY FORMER LT. GOV. BULLOCK, 69, DIES IN TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
and R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Former Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock, who became a
dominant figure in modern Texas politics during four decades of
public service, died Friday at the age of 69.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock had a long history of health problems. Since leaving
office in January, he had been undergoing chemotherapy for lung
cancer, and recently developed pneumonia and congestive heart
failure. The cause of death was not immediately known.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is the last giant of a past era,'' said Gov. George
W. Bush, who will deliver the eulogy at Bullock's funeral services
on Sunday. ``I think people will talk about him for a long, long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullock's body will not lie in state at the Capitol at the
request of the family. Services will be at 2 p.m. at Austin's
Central Christian Church; former Texas House Speaker Byron Tunnell
also will deliver a eulogy. Graveside services, to which the public
is invited, will follow immediately at the Texas State Cemetery.
Pallbearers will be a detachment of Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; A colorful, crusty figure, Bullock's take-no-prisoners style
led him to be revered by many and feared by others. Though he never
made a race for Texas governor, the Hillsboro native served as
legislator, secretary of state and state comptroller before winning
election in 1990 as lieutenant governor, a position he held until
January.
</P>
<P>
   As lieutenant governor, the presiding officer of the Senate,
Bullock was a major political player this decade along with Govs.
Ann Richards and George W. Bush. A 1950s-style conservative
Democrat, Bullock helped shape state government to enter the 21st
century.
</P>
<P>
   He typically closed his speeches with the personal benediction,
``God bless Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   As his star in politics rose, his personal life was a roller
coaster, with five marriages, two to the same woman. He married his
current wife, Jan Felts Teague, in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   A tumultuous period of Bullock's life that would have finished
many political careers ended in 1981 when Bullock, then state
comptroller, entered treatment and became a recovering alcoholic.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, he shocked the Texas political community by announcing
he would not seek re-election as lieutenant governor the following
year.
</P>
<P>
   In January, when he left office, a bipartisan state Senate
passed a resolution honoring Bullock as ``a legendary figure ... a
uniquely talented individual of imposing political presence ... a
man of remarkable insight and vision.''
</P>
<P>
   The resolution didn't spare the superlatives. Few people would
deny that the plaudits were well-deserved tributes to the single
biggest presence in state government of most living Texans'
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   But the resolution didn't come close to capturing a public
career often &UR;  &LR; abrasive, sometimes pure political genius and
certainly never dull.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock made innumerable marks, not only on state policy but
also on the backsides of as many aides, lawmakers and lobbyists as
he deemed necessary to get those policies forged.
</P>
<P>
   He first earned statewide prominence during a 16-year reign as
state comptroller, in which he brought that office into the
computer age and became a key player in the state's budget-setting
process.
</P>
<P>
   His subsequent eight years as lieutenant governor, in which he
helped draft or negotiate virtually every major piece of
legislation to emerge from the Capitol, earned him a revered _ and
feared _ status achieved by few political figures.
</P>
<P>
   Austin political consultant George Christian, a Democrat who
worked with Bullock on civil justice changes, said Bullock's
eagerness to lead in offering solutions to controversial problems
set him apart from most state officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most public officials today are so cautious and so reticent to
get out in front on controversial issues,'' Christian said. ``He
was totally unafraid to move right into battle.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line for Bullock, according to former longtime aide
Glen Castlebury, was making government work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He really believed government could work, and for everything
under his jurisdiction, it did,'' Castlebury said.
</P>
<P>
   Some people compared Bullock's stature to that of President
Lyndon B. Johnson, for whom Christian worked as White House press
secretary. In some ways, Christian said, Bullock reminded him of
Johnson because both had ``so much drive behind them.''
</P>
<P>
   But there were significant differences. For one thing, Christian
said, even the hard-boiled LBJ was no match for Bullock in the art
of what Bullock-watchers came to call ``drive-by ass chewings.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Whitmire, D-Houston, a key Senate committee chairman
under Bullock, recalled that the tongue-lashings could get ``pretty
personal.''
</P>
<P>
   Castlebury said the dressings-down were ``commensurate with the
capability of the person being chewed out. He didn't chew out
janitors.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Castlebury added, ``The rewards were equally
commensurate.''
</P>
<P>
   Castlebury, now public information director for the Texas
Department of Criminal Justice, is one of many former Bullock
staffers still in state government or the Austin lobby. Their
training and work experience under the taskmaster made them
invaluable to their new employers.
</P>
<P>
   In a Houston Chronicle interview shortly before he left office,
Bullock said his alumni were the proudest accomplishment of his
political career: ``We attracted the brightest that there were in
state government,'' he said. ``I'm real proud of that. A person is
only as good as the staff he employs.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullock associates said he was a demanding workaholic.
</P>
<P>
   More than once, Whitmire recalled, he was awakened by a phone
call from Bullock in the middle of the night or interrupted while
mowing his lawn on a Saturday to learn Bullock's latest idea.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock also was unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   Several weeks after moving into the lieutenant governor's office
during a budget crunch in 1991, he shocked the statehouse and the
business community by advocating a personal income tax _ a major
political taboo in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know deep down in my heart, deep down in my heart, that it's
the right thing to do for Texas,'' Bullock said.
</P>
<P>
   But he lost that initiative _ one of the few losses of his
career _ after Gov. Richards, other state leaders and most lobby
groups remained adamantly opposed to it.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Bullock pulled another surprise by engineering
a constitutional amendment that most observers believe all but
guaranteed that Texas would never have a personal income tax in his
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   The amendment, overwhelmingly adopted by lawmakers and Texas
voters, bans a personal income tax unless the voters approve one.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock denied making an about-face on the tax issue and said
simply that the taxpayers are in partnership with the Legislature
and should decide about an income tax together.
</P>
<P>
   Liking nothing better than unanimous votes in the Senate on
major issues, Bullock pressed senators and lobbyists to negotiate
compromises in private. There were so many unanimous or
near-unanimous Senate votes in 1993 that some House members joked
that senators who wanted to express dissent voted ``aye'' with
their eyes closed.
</P>
<P>
   And the process, although effective, drew complaints from
consumer advocates who felt they were locked out of negotiations on
such key decisions as tort reform and utility regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock's early political career was nothing extraordinary, with
a few years spent in the Texas House, a few years practicing law
and a stint as an assistant attorney general, where he headed up
the first anti-trust and consumer protection division. In that
office he won several historic cases, including a multimillion
dollar recovery in a price-fixing lawsuit against five
pharmaceutical companies. He served as a counsel to Gov. Preston
Smith from 1969-71 and was then appointed secretary of state by
Smith. As secretary of state, Bullock pushed to give 18-year-olds
voting rights.
</P>
<P>
   Smith also appointed Bullock to the then-State Board of
Insurance. But Ben Barnes, a political enemy and lieutenant
governor at the time, arranged to have the Senate bust his
confirmation, an act that Bullock never forgot.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock earned a reputation as Smith's ``hatchet man,'' who took
delight in attacking the governor's political opponents. When
Barnes challenged Smith in the 1972 governor's race in the
Democratic primary, Bullock _ or so it has been told _ would
gleefully call the Barnes campaign almost daily to announce how he
was going to mess with his enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Smith and Barnes lost the race to an outsider, Uvalde rancher
Dolph Briscoe, and Bullock took another leave from state government
until he was elected comptroller in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   As comptroller, Bullock modernized the state's tax collection
procedures and conducted well-publicized raids of businesses owned
by delinquent taxpayers, spawning the term ``Bullock's Raiders'' in
government lexicon. But he was often controversial.
</P>
<P>
   A state grand jury, which investigated Bullock for political
misuse of office, issued a critical report, but cleared him of
criminal wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock openly feuded with some reporters and even sent two
newsmen gift boxes of cow chips (the real thing) for writing things
he particularly didn't like.
</P>
<P>
   Although he usually arrived at the office by 7 a.m., a former
assistant recalled, Bullock would frequently leave by midafternoon
and go to happy hour. Beer or Old Charter and 7-Up were his drinks
of choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alcohol was in control. The slave had become the master,''
Bullock told a 1981 Capitol news conference, after returning home
from alcoholism treatment in California.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock repeatedly tried to quit smoking, following a series of
serious health problems. He lost part of a lung years ago,
underwent heart bypass surgery in 1994 and last fall had surgery to
implant a pacemaker. He was suffering from pneumonia in January as
he presided over the Senate on the opening day of the session.
</P>
<P>
   If Bullock didn't completely mellow, he at least adjusted to the
state's changing political winds.
</P>
<P>
   During his first session as lieutenant governor in 1991, he
bumped two Republicans from committee chairs and appointed an
all-Democratic leadership lineup in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   But he became bipartisan as Republicans increased their Senate
membership. He named GOP senators to key committee posts and
developed a good working relationship with Republican Gov. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Bullock endorsed Bush for re-election over Democrat
Garry Mauro, his own protege, and even said Bush would make a great
president.
</P>
<P>
   After he turned over his job to Republican Rick Perry this year,
Bullock joined Public Strategies Inc., a public affairs and
management consulting firm headed by close friend Jack Martin.
</P>
<P>
   As he prepared to leave office, Bullock briefly reflected on his
political career for reporters:
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been the most fascinating life that I could imagine.''
</P>
<P>
   In lieu of flowers, the family prefers memorial donations be
made to the Bob Bullock Endowed Scholarship Fund, Baylor
University, P.O. Box 97026, Waco, Tx., 76798.
</P>
<P>
   Bullock is survived by his wife, Jan; son, Robert D. ``Bobby''
Bullock Jr. of Austin; daughter, Lindy Ward of Austin and her
husband, Phil; grandson, Grant Bullock Robinson of Austin; and
stepdaughter, Kimberly Ader of Houston and her husband, Jeff.
Bullock also is survived by his brother, Tom, of Brenham and his
wife, Jane. Bullock was preceded in death by two sisters, Sara Read
and Louisa Bond. &UR;

TRIO AT TOP OF OPEN AFTER TWO DAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ The almanac for North Carolina lists the
indisputable fact that the sun will rise here Saturday morning at
6:08 a.m. That fact is as relevant to what will happen today and
tomorrow in the 99th United States Open as the golf almanacs of the
future listing Payne Stewart, David Duval and Phil Mickelson as the
co-leaders after Friday's second round.
</P>
<P>
   That's because 156 of the best golfers of the world have been
baffled, befuddled and mesmerized by Pinehurst No. 2, so much so
that only three golfers managed to better par -- and that by only a
stroke -- and only four more equaled par on a day that one lifelong
Southener described ``as the best day I've ever seen here in late
June.'' Clear, crisp, cool and dry, no humidity. Perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the golfers could only fidget and fret as they neared
closer and closer to the greens and the starched, crisp collars
that surround these greens. Some lost their cool, such as Spain's
Jose Maria Olazabal, the Masters' champion, fashioning his personal
Grand Slam by pounding the wall of the locker room Thursday in
frustration after shooting an opening round 75 but breaking a bone
in his hand, causing him to withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was upset with myself to finish like I did,'' said Olazabal,
who is expected to be out three to four weeks and may also miss the
British Open. ``I did something I shouldn't have done; I wasn't
happy with the way I hit the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor were many others who teed it up at Pinehurst No 2. Others,
such as Greg Norman, Mark O'Meara, Fred Couples, Curtis Strange,
Jack Nicklaus and Lee Westwood saw their scores sky to the upper
ozone, all missing the cut. Two-time Open champion Ernie Els also
missed the cut and Lee Janzen, the defending champion, only made
the cut by chipping in from the fringe on the 18th hole.
</P>
<P>
   As much as the weather was perfect, the golf was far from it.
``It was like I was in the video store picking out all the bad
movies instead of the good ones,'' said Norman, who on Wednesday
had praised this ``as the best Open ever'' but whose 78-141 left
him four strokes from further competition. ``It was a horror show
out there; it was not enjoyable out there for me.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, 21 golfers had shot birdie rounds. But the mere
three who could manage it Friday -- Stewart, Jeff Maggert and John
Huston -- showed the mesmerizing effect of Donald Rosss' Pinehurst
No. 2 on the field. Usually at the Open, red (birdie) scores do not
begin dropping from the leaderboards until midway through the
Saturday round when pressure builds; at Pinehurst, it began a day
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``They need a little more turf around the greens,'' complained
Curtis Strange, who missed the cut on the last year of his 10-year
exemption for winning the Open at Brookline in 1988 and Oak Hill in
Rochester in 1989. ``They said they wanted more chipping from
around the greens here for this Open, but what they did was have a
lot more putting from off the green.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Nicklaus agreed (``I chipped the ball once in 36 holes
here'') but both Nicklaus and Strange, as well as Norman and many
other golfers who struggled here said Pinehurst, which is holding
its first Open, should be included in the usual rotation of Open
courses. ``The Open definitely should come back here,'' said
Norman.
</P>
<P>
   As for Olazabal's grand slam, Norman said he could understand
the Spaniard's frustration. ``But I would have kicked the wall,''
said the Australian. ``I wouldn't have punched it.'' And John Daly,
whose score ballooned Friday to 77 (145), commiserated, saying,
``We all do it. But he's got the Green Jacket and I'm playing like
crap.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, just as the 6:08 time for sunrise here must be
noted in almanacs, Stewart (69-137), Duval (70-137) and Mickelson
(70-137) are tied for the lead. Tiger Woods (71-139), Hal Sutton,
Vijay Singh and Billy Mayfair are all tied at 139, two strokes
behind the three leaders, with Maggert and Huston a stroke behind
them.
</P>
<P>
   The true Open won't begin until Sunday afternoon when the
converging pressures of winning the Open and dealing with Donald
Ross' golf architectural idiosyncracies will clash here at
Pinehurst. No prediction of any kind can be made by anyone since
this is the first Open in eons where it is the chipping areas
around the greens, and not ankle-high rough, that is trapping the
world's best golfers.
</P>
<P>
   The pre-Open prediction, for instance, that it would be the
Europeans whose finely-tuned short-game was most suited for Ross'
Pinehurst No. 2, proved to be a myth. Of the 10 leaders on the
board, all except Singh of Fiji, are Americans and the top European
scorer is Sweden's Jesper Parnevik, who is tied for 14th place.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, meanwhile, is in contention for a major for only the
second time since crushing the 1997 Masters field. ``I mean, I've
played two rounds in competition now here and I feel I've hit only
one or two putts for birdies where you can actually take a run
at,'' said Woods, hinting at the mysteries of No. 2. ``You don't
see that very often. You can say that about Augusta all the time;
... these greens are very severe.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, meanwhile, is a fixture at the Open. He won at
Hazeltine eight years ago and four times in the 1990s Stewart has
been the leader or co-leader after two rounds. Indeed, Stewart has
played 55 rounds at the Open and has been in the top 10 at the end
of an amazing 22 of those rounds; in 10 of those rounds he has been
the leader.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he has won only once. ``I think one of the reasons I do
well at US Opens is that I get a mindset that par is a good
score,'' said Stewart. ``You're never losing to anybody (with a
par).''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more important is that Stewart had spent extra time
working on his short game preparing for the Open at Pinehurst.
``But I don't know where there's a place that you can create the
chipping that you have to do around here,'' said Stewart. ``But
what I was doing was working on my feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson, meanwhile, still has not received the beeper from
wife Amy, due with child in 10 days, ``but when I hear it, I'm
making a bee-line to the airport and I'm out of here,'' Mickelson
said again. The lefty, another renowned chip-meister, said his
confidence in his short game gives him an extra cushion of
confidence here; ``I don't feel I have to hit every shot perfect
because I feel there's a margin of error where my short game can
make up for it.''

   WASHINGTON _ In a dramatic twist to the fractious debate over
firearms, the House of Representatives rejected a modest gun
control bill Friday, raising the possibility that Congress may not
be able to pass such legislation this year.
</P>
<P>
   As Republicans and Democrats traded blame, President Clinton
vowed to renew his campaign for tougher gun laws and fulfill his
pledge ``to the families of the children who died in Littleton.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just getting warmed up,'' said Clinton. ``I'm energized
for the fight.''
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats joined more than 80 Republicans to defeat the
package of gun control measures supported by the National Rifle
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would have required criminal background checks at gun
shows, but reduced by two-thirds the waiting period allowed under
current law for the checks to be completed. An amendment would have
overridden laws in the District of Columbia barring residents from
owning handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Other amendments adopted before the bill's defeat would have
imposed new controls, such as mandating the sale of trigger locks
with guns, banning high-capacity ammunition clips and prohibiting
violent juveniles from later possessing guns as adults.
</P>
<P>
   Some Democrats, rallied by House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt,
said they could not support the bill because it weakened existing
Brady laws, reducing to 24 hours the waiting period at gun shows
and allowing dealers to ship guns across state lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republicans and the NRA put this together to defeat
common-sense legislation,'' said Gephardt. ``This whole process has
been an abomination.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans accused Gephardt and the Democrats of rejecting
``sensible'' gun control and putting ``partisanship over
progress.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let there be no mistake,'' said House Speaker Dennis Hastert
(R-Ill.). ``The vast majority of the Democrat caucus walked away
when they had the chance to walk forward for the good of the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither side talked much about defections within their own
ranks. Forty-five Democrats voted for the weakened gun show
language before switching to vote against the final bill.
Eighty-two Republicans, both conservatives and moderates, voted
against the final bill, which failed 147-280.

   As Internet stocks hit new highs two months ago, a giddy fever
swept through the corridors of on-line companies nationwide. Young
entrepreneurs and their venture backers holed up in cramped
offices, hatching plans to go public.
</P>
<P>
   The market for Internet stocks was searing and, they believed
then, there was no better time to sell new shares to the
dot.com-hungry investors who craved them.
</P>
<P>
   And so May was the busiest month in the short history of public
ownership of Internet companies. But despite one-day gains that
doubled some offering prices, many of these issues subsequently
sank, a result of the recent disenchantment with Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 25 Internet concerns that went public in May, 14 are now
trading below their offering prices. The worst performer is
Comps.com Inc., the Internet real estate site brought public by th
underwriter Volpe Brown Whelan &AMP; Co. Comps.com closed on Friday at
$7.375, 51 percent below the price at hich it went public on May 5.
</P>
<P>
   The star, so far, is Redback Ndetworks Inc., which is up an
eye-popping 345 percent since Morgan Stahnley Dean Witter took it
public on May 17.
</P>
<P>
   But kudos for the time being, may belong to Goldman Sachs Group.
It brought five companies public in May, more than any other
investment bank. And investors who were lucky enough to get shares
early were generally rewarded.
</P>
<P>
   Of those five companies, four are trading above their offering
prices, with Portal Software the best of the bunch _ up 243
percent. &QL;

BOY CHOSEN BY CHINA AS PANCHEN LAMA APPEARS IN LHASA, TIBET'S
CAPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (pr)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The 9-year-old declared by China to be the Panchen
Lama, the second-ranking Tibetan Buddhist spiritual leader, has
appeared in the capital of Tibet, for the first time since his
appointment in 1995, the state press reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, Gyaincain Norbu, has received spiritual training under
Government protection in a secret location since his disputed
appointment four years ago. Another contender for his title, whom
the exiled Dalai Lama endorses, is believed to be under house
arrest with his parents somewhere in China.
</P>
<P>
   In his four years of seclusion, according to the report by the
New China News Agency, Norbu ``diligently studied Buddhist
sutras,'' and he ``can recite sutras for three successive days.''
</P>
<P>
   On his arrival in the capital, Lhasa, he was greeted by leading
political officials and lamas from major Tibetan temples, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1995, the Dalai Lama, who ranks first in Tibetan
Buddhism, angered the Chinese authorities by announcing his own
selection as the reincarnation of the previous Panchen Lama, who
died in 1989. The Dalai Lama fled Tibet in 1959, after an abortive
uprising against Communist rule, and now heads a government in
exile in the Indian hillside town of Dharamsala.
</P>
<P>
   The boy whom he named in 1995, Gedhun Choikyi Nyima, was already
on the short list of a government-approved selection committee. But
the Dalai Lama is seen by the government as an enemy, and Beijing
officials, angered by his effort to pre-empt their selection
process, declared his choice invalid.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, officials of the atheist Communist Party staged a
ceremony dating from imperial times, in which the reincarnated lama
is selected by lots drawn from a golden urn. The winning name was
then endorsed by the State Council, the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   The report Friday said that the Panchen Lama, the 11th in the
line, ``is now the esteemed and beloved religious leader of the
Tibetan people.'' But many Tibetans reportedly believe that the one
selected by the Dalai Lama and under house arrest is the true
reincarnation.
</P>
<P>
   The report did not say where the 9-year-old lama would live or
under how he would exercise his leadership.

CARROLL FACES FORMIDABLE TASK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   When the NFL preseason hype begins in the next few weeks, look
for Pete Carroll to win the honors as most likely coach to get
fired. Despite all the optimism after the Patriots' minicamp
workouts concluded, Carroll is a dead man walking. A couple of days
after the draft, a top Patriots executive asked me: What do you
think? I told him I thought Carroll just got fired; that nothing
happened in the draft that would help Carroll win this year.
</P>
<P>
   It says here that Carroll has the toughest job of any coach
heading into training camp next month. His team finished fourth in
the AFC East last year, and you can bet the preseason polls will
rank the Patriots fourth or worst. If the Colts hadn't traded
Marshall Faulk and his 2,300 yards of offense, I'd pick them for
fifth myself.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of last year, the Patriots have lost their top
running back, Robert Edwards, to a knee injury and have no one of
his caliber to replace him. The Patriots lost center Dave
Wohlabaugh, arguably their best offensive lineman, to free agency
and are supposed to replace him with top draft choice Damian Woody.
Woody will not be as good this year as Wohlabaugh.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots are also trying to force one or two second-year
players, Ed Ellis and Damon Denson, into the lineup at guard to
replace either Todd Rucci or Max Lane, who have been regulars the
last two years. Without playing a game since last year, how did
Ellis and Denson become better than Rucci and Lane? So, with no
big-time running back, and the possiblity of two or three rookie
offensive linemen, the Patriots are going to be worse off than last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, linebacker Todd Collins left for the Rams via free
agency. He was the team's best pass coverage man, and released
defensive end Ferric Collons, who was its best run stopper. The
Patriots also lost a terrific punter and backup quarterback, Tom
Tupa, to free agency and the Jets.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Jets have signed four other free agents whom they
are going to plug into the starting lineup. Miami coach Jimmy
Johnson says the Dolphins are much better than last year's playoff
team. Buffalo, with Doug Flutie having a full year running the
offense under his belt, is the AFC's real sleeper, in this humble
writer's opinion. The Bills could win it all. Indianapolis is going
to be better after signing a ton of free agents to help its
defense, the Colts' weak spot last year.
</P>
<P>
   Now take a Patriots team that doesn't look as good as last
year's, four immediate competitors who look better and mix in the
new stadium situation, and Pete Carroll has a load to try to carry.
</P>
<P>
   In trying to sell luxury boxes, premium seats, and tickets for a
new stadium in Foxborough, it is imperative for the Patriots to get
off to a fast start. Flutie proved it in Buffalo last year. The
Bills couldn't get the big-money seats sold, until Flutie came off
the bench to electrify the city with his play, and produce an
atmosphere of excitement that led to all of the seats being sold
before the December deadline, ensuring the Bills would remain in
Buffalo for the immediate future.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll is going to need every break he can get to survive. At
the end of last year, the Patriots ``reviewed'' his efforts as head
coach before saying he would be back for another year. Carroll is
on the third year of a five-year contract. There are 10 players,
five starters, who are heading to free agency at the end of the
season. That is about normal for an NFL team, but as Drew Bledsoe
said: ``This might be the last year a lot of us play together.'' It
is critical that the Patriots sign Lawyer Milloy and Ty Law, two of
the best players in the league, to long-term contracts. However,
there is only one ``franchise'' designation left, in case both want
to remain Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   So this is the most critical time since Bill Parcells arrived in
Foxborough in 1993 for the Patriots to start to turn the franchise
around. Carroll must try to keep it afloat under some very tough
circumstances. It's not going to be easy.

   Adam Harrington stopped by the Massachusetts-Amherst basketball
offices a couple of weeks back to say he didn't want to go to
school close to home. Harrington, the state's top prospect two
years ago, started at guard in his freshman year at North Carolina
State but decided to move on. The guessing is that he will end up
at Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Bradley, a Kentucky transfer, has announced for
Villanova, but Rick Pitino reportedly was working hard to keep him
at home in Worcester at Holy Cross, with old friend Ralph Willard.
</P>
<P>
   Did you know that Knicks coach Jeff Van Gundy began his college
and pro coaching career under Pitino. Pitino gave him his first
assistant's job at Providence and later brought him to New York and
the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Zero on Nit-Wit Radio likes to say that Pitino can't be
successful coaching the Celtics because he is a control freak,
calling all the offensive and defensive sets. Van Gundy does the
same thing with the Knicks, making all the calls when the ball
moves over halfcourt.

   Boston College athletic director Gene DeFilippo thinks the
proposal not to allow freshmen to play varsity sports is going
nowhere. ``I don't think it has a chance. It would be too costly
for the colleges to do something like that, although they (NCAA)
are looking hard to find some kind of reasonable solution to kids
just coming to college for a year or two and then jumping into pro
ball. But not letting them play as freshmen is not the way to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul McMahon would love to see the NCAA rule freshmen
ineligible. ``I think it would really help us,'' said McMahon, who
is trying to put together the Collegiate Professional League. ``We
still hope to open our league in November of 2000,'' says McMahon,
who wants to take high school basketball players and pay them to
play in his league rather than go to college.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the big-time high school players do not get an
education in college,'' said McMahon. ``You can see that by looking
at the graduation rates. If a player comes to our league, he would
get $17,000 the first year to play, all the way up to $25,000 in
his senior year, if he was still in the league. We would love to
see our players get drafted by the NBA. But until they do, we would
put them in a local college, to fit their level of education, in
whatever city they would play in.''
</P>
<P>
   McMahon envisions an eight-team league, set in big markets in
the Northeast and Midwest. ``We have three major sponsors committed
already,'' said McMahon, ``and we have sent letters to all NBA
owners offering an equity position in our league to join forces
with us.'' Simply put, in McMahon's plan, a top high school player
would go to high school, then play in his league, and then go on
the NBA, finishing his education when his playing days are all
over.

   Major League Baseball is going to have a press conference in
Boston the week before the All-Star game to announce the plan to
bust ticket scalpers and sellers of counterfeit merchandise.
``Because of the size of Fenway Park (smallest in the major
leagues) and a lot of people going to Boston to try to see the
park, this is going to be the most sought after All-Star ticket of
them all,'' says Kevin Hallinan, Major League Baseball's director
of security. ``We have already been in touch with the Boston Police
and all the major law enforcement agencies on this. They will be at
the press conference to emphasize how tough we are going to be
looking for scalpers and people selling counterfeit merchandise. We
can guarantee that there are people around this country who have
alrady made up All-Star Game T-shirts, hats, and other merchandise,
and have it loaded in tractor-trailer trucks ready to sell in
Boston. Then when the T-shirt falls apart after the first washing,
we are the first ones to get the complaints.''

   Here's a rags-to-riches story. Joe O'Donnell, the head of Boston
Concessions, was recently elected to Harvard's board of overseers,
one of only 30 such positions. O'Donnell, the son of an Everett
cop, came to Harvard hat in hand and holes in pants in 1963 and was
captain of its baseball team and started on the football team for
two years. Now he'll serve for six years on the board, which meets
five times a year and, among other functions, approves Harvard's
presidential appointment.

   Consider this. In this era of baseball, major league teams
usually have their top prospects at the Double-AA level. The cycle
works this way. Each year the teams sign a bunch of young players
out of high school and college after the draft. They send them to
four Class A, or entry-level, teams. With the Red Sox, that means
Fort Myers in the Gulf Coast League or Lowell in the New York-Penn
League. Most of the time, the young players on Lowell are the
drafted high school kids or youngsters out of the Caribbean
leagues. They play a ``short season,'' running from June to early
September. The other Red Sox Single-A teams are in Augusta, Ga.,
and Sarasota, Fla. These are where the college players are assigned
and play a longer season than the young signees. When the year is
over, the four teams are evaluated, and the best players are sent
to the Red Sox' Double-A team in Trenton, N.J. The Trenton Thunder
had the best record of any team in professional baseball starting
the week, 42-18. So this seems to indicate the Sox' talent at that
level, is as good, if not better, than any team in the majors. It
appears that, in the next three years, the Red Sox should be able
to bring up several players who are better than they now have to
start at some positions . . . Some NBA insiders are saying the
Celtics really are shopping Ron Mercer and Ken Anderson, but that
if any team wants Mercer, it has to take Anderson, too, because the
Celtics want to get rid of Anderson's money.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ed Anderson, one of the Providence Bruins' owners, said he and
his partners won't see any financial benefits from his team's
record-breaking season until next year. ``We didn't make a lot of
money,'' says Anderson, whose team won a record 71 games and the
American Hockey League championship. ``Our attendance went up about
1,200 more per game than the year before, but we spent more on
player payroll getting players in here that could turn this team
around. This town fell in love with our team, so we hope to see the
(financial) benefits next year when our fans start buying season
tickets.'' The old AHL record of wins in a season was 64, combining
regular-season and playoff wins. Providence passed that by seven
wins was an incredible 43-7 at home with a 15-game Civic Center
winning streak to end the season.

AGREEMENT REACHED ON DEPLOYMENT OF RUSSIAN TROOPS IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELSINKI, Finland _ Russia and the United States, ending three
days of grueling negotiations, Friday signed a military agreement
that integrates Russia into the Kosovo peacekeeping force, dividing
the bulk of 3,500 Russian troops among three of five sectors led by
NATO countries.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement broke a tense stalemate over Russia's role in
Kosovo, and opened the way for restoration of Russia's links to the
Western alliance, which Moscow froze last March when NATO launched
airstrikes against Yugoslavia, its historical ally in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our agreement recognizes the stakes that Russia and NATO share
in Europe's future,'' said Secretary of Defense William Cohen at
signing ceremonies held late Friday at Finland's presidential
palace. ``It also shows that the U.S. and Russia can work together
on important security issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The talks here began at a low point in U.S.-Russian relations,
which have been scarred by the conflict in Yugoslavia and again
last week by Moscow's sudden decision to preempt NATO by
dispatching 200 Russian paratroopers to the Kosovo capital of
Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   By agreeing to a distribution of Russian troops in sectors of
Kosovo controlled by France, Germany and the United States, Russian
negotiators stepped back from an initial demand for a separate
Russian sector in the Serbian province. That demand had been
reinforced by President Boris Yeltsin, who said in Moscow on
Thursday that he had instructed his top envoy to the talks, Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev, to stand fast on Russia's insistence for a
sector of its own.
</P>
<P>
   But at the signing ceremonies, Sergeyev and Russian foreign
minister Igor Ivanov said the compromise arrangement, thrashed out
during 33 hours of negotiation and laid out in exhaustive detail in
the final document, had met Yeltsin's requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found an alternative solution which will assure such kind
of deployment that will enable Russian troops to actively
participate in the peacekeeping operation,'' Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the agreement carried out Yeltsin's instructions,
Ivanov gave a curt reply. ``If it did not correspond to the
president's instructions, Sergeyev would not have signed,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   From the start of the talks American negotiators, acting on
behalf of their NATO allies, said they would not yield on certain
principles _ or ``red lines'' _ which included the preservation of
a unified command structure for the NATO-led force in Kosovo, and a
refusal to grant Russia a sector of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, for its part, had said it would not put its troops under
NATO command, or follow arrangements now in place for the shared
command of 1,300 Russian soldiers deployed as part of an
international peacekeeping force in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   According to a senior Defense Department official, the command
arrangement included in the agreement would give Russian commanders
a greater say in the Kosovo peacekeeping operations, at all levels.
``There is an important distinction from the Bosnia arrangement,''
he said. ``Under this arrangement, the Russian role is more
intensive, more integrated and the participation is greater.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the agreement calls for a 10-member Russian
military delegation to NATO's military headquarters, three Russian
officers posted at NATO's southern command headquarters in Naples,
Italy, and Russian commanders assigned to the NATO-led peacekeeping
forces in the three sectors where their troops will serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russian troops will be under the tactical command of KFOR,''
said Cohen Friday night, referring to the Kosovo peacekeeping
force. ``But in operational terms, political and military, they
will be answerable to the national command authority of Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the senior Defense Department official, the
agreement also gives Russian forces the right to refuse to
participate in certain operations as long as they recognize that
other forces may move in and carry out the disputed tasks. He said
the Russians were reassured that similar conditions have been
imposed on other national forces participating in the Kosovo
peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
   In NATO's view, a separate Russian sector would have resulted in
a de facto partition of Kosovo, with the Serbian population
withdrawing to the area under Russian protection, and Kosovo
Albanians dominant in the five NATO sectors, controlled by Italy,
Britain, France, Germany and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials are also concerned that the Russians, left in
control of a large patch of territory, would pull away from the
unified command structure that is considered essential to an
effective peacekeeping operation.

   GRYKA E NEKOVCIT, Yugoslavia _ For more than a mile, they line
the hillsides of this narrow gorge in the heart of Kosovo:
makeshift shelters put together from tree branches and plastic
sheeting that gave shelter to more than 5,000 Albanians fleeing
Yugoslav attacks during the last three months.
</P>
<P>
   Faik Thachi came here in late March with his wife and five
children thinking that his stay would last just a few weeks. It
would be uncomfortable and cold, but they would be safely out of
range of Yugoslav artillery.
</P>
<P>
   They ended up staying three months. As the conflict wore on,
life became a grinding waiting game in this crowded gorge clogged
with mud, smoke and squalor. Food occasionally ran out. The
children became ill with dehydration and diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   Thachi passed his days dreading long-range rocket attacks and
listening to the radio for the faintest sign of change. At one
point, a rocket landed 700 yards from him and his daughter. At
night, he and hundreds of other men searched desperately for food
in abandoned villages nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most difficult moment was when I knew I didn't have any
more food for my children,'' said Thachi, a bespectacled,
soft-spoken man who is 41. ``There wasn't anything left.''
</P>
<P>
   No one is certain how many Kosovo Albanians managed to hide
themselves in the woods. But Thachi and his family were among the
thousands who managed to stay out of harm's way in this gorge.
Their plight was the focus of intense concern among aid groups that
unsuccessfully proposed missions to air-drop food into the forests
to help them.
</P>
<P>
   Most of them, according to initial reports, appear to have
survived, though there are many cases of malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
   Some, like Lul Raka, a 30-year-old doctor from the town of
Kacanik, practiced medicine in the woods of southern Kosovo for
three months and grew to enjoy life in the wild. Others, like Asem
Hasan, a 50-year-old bus driver from the village of Dumsic in
northern Kosovo, lost their cat-and-mouse game and were driven from
the hills by Yugoslav soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   For Thachi, his time in hiding proved far more arduous than
expected. But he said he was always completely convinced that NATO
would prevail.
</P>
<P>
   ``When most wars begin, people aren't sure what will happen, who
will win,'' he said. ``But I knew from the first moment that the
Serbs could never win.''
</P>
<P>
   But early on, they did, sending Thachi and his family to the
hills six days after NATO airstrikes began.
</P>
<P>
   When Yugoslav soldiers rolled into his small hometown, Komarane
in central Kosovo, Thachi quickly loaded his wife, Sheherije, and
their children, ages 12, 10, 8, 7 and 17 months, onto a trailer,
hitched it to his farm tractor, threw in pre-packed bags, and
headed for the woods.
</P>
<P>
   He had done this before, living in the same narrow gorge, with
its fast-running stream and verdant hillsides, for a month in May
of last year after a Yugoslav offensive also drove him from home.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife packed plastic sheeting for a shelter, a small
wood stove, warm clothing and several mattresses, as well as flour
and other food.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day he carved out a spot of level ground from the
hillside and fashioned a shelter by nailing together tree branches,
bending them to form a smooth, curved roof, and lining them with
plastic. More plastic was placed on the ground to keep their
mattresses dry. Finally, dirt was piled along the sides of the
shelter to seal it. With the wood-burning stove, the shelter was
smoky but warm.
</P>
<P>
   Makeshift outhouses positioned over the stream running through
the center of the gorge made the water dangerous to drink. To
prevent the children, particularly their youngest, from getting
sick, Thachi and his wife drew water from a nearby spring. But even
that failed to keep the children from quickly contracting diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   To Thachi's dismay, the conflict did not end quickly. A
political moderate who worked with Serbs and had a Serb girlfriend
when he was younger, he was stunned by the intensity of the Serbian
attacks.
</P>
<P>
   After a few weeks in the woods, their initial supply of food
quickly dwindled as the family shivered in the late winter
temperatures. In the first of what would be a half dozen trips, his
foraging for food in abandoned Albanian homes and farms turned up
sacks of wheat or corn flower, which could be made into bread, as
well as dry beans or vegetables and potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Venturing as far as five miles from the gorge, he and other men
scavenged during nights when there was little or no moon. Unarmed,
they feared tripping a mine or encountering a Yugoslav patrol. ``We
had to get back before dawn,'' he said. ``Whoever was left would be
shot by soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the first month, his fears of starvation eased
with each successful foraging mission. As temperatures warmed, the
gorge evolved into a small makeshift city. Bread was baked on the
small wood stoves, cows brought into the hills by Albanians were
slaughtered, and women tried to keep a semblance of normality by
ceaselessly washing their children's clothes and brushing dirt from
their plastic shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Thachi's family gradually grew accustomed to living outdoors.
They ate bread and beans each day. They ate meat and drank cow's
milk once a week. His infant son was fed powdered milk, and the
diarrhea, which could have killed him if he had become too
dehydrated, eased.
</P>
<P>
   As the conflict moved through its second month, the only thing
separating Thachi from the Serbs was a stack of boulders manned by
Kosovo Liberation Army rebels with 100 rounds of ammunition. Other
nearby valleys in the area, the southern tip of the Drenica region,
the heartland of the rebels, were also packed with Albanians. He
feared that they might make a tempting target.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Thachi, who observed the Yugoslavs from the hills by
binoculars, said that on several occasions NATO air attacks
thwarted potential Yugoslav attacks. ``When a lot of tanks would go
down close to the hill, NATO would bomb them,'' he said. Kosovo
Liberation Army soldiers also managed to mine the roads below,
slowing Yugoslav operations.
</P>
<P>
   But as the third month began, two incidents alarmed Thachi. He
returned from two foraging trips empty-handed and realized that he
and other men were being gradually forced to venture farther and
farther away from the hills to get food.
</P>
<P>
   And in late May, 16 screeching Katyusha rockets fired miles away
by the Yugoslavs fell into nearby hills. One rocket struck a tent
in the gorge 700 yards from where he and his daughter were
gathering wood, and it killed four children and a mother. ``I was
very frightened my children would be hurt,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Thachi said that even at this point he did not consider
fleeing to Macedonia or Albania. He said he believed that it would
be safer to remain in the woods than pass through Serb lines.
Leaving, he also said, would only further President Slobodan
Milosevic's goal of emptying Kosovo of Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   But he also bluntly said he was willing to risk the lives of his
wife and children for Kosovo. ``I was willing to risk my life and
the lives of my family because I knew freedom was close,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Freedom came early this week with the arrival of British troops
in the area. Over the next several days, he and the other 5,000
people in the gorge packed up their tractors and drove home.
</P>
<P>
   But when he finally returned to Komorane on Wednesday, he found
his home gutted by fire.
</P>
<P>
   Thachi said the experience had changed him in many ways. A heavy
drinker and big spender before his time in the woods, he now
pledges to be a better provider for his family. He is clearly proud
of weathering the ordeal and of the toughness he showed. And in a
change that does not bode well for any semblance of a multi-ethnic
Kosovo, Thachi, once a moderate, now views Serbs through a
different prism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respected the Serbs very, very much before,'' he said.
``Now, I don't even want to look at them.''

BUSH SIGNS BILL BANNING ANTI-GUN LAWSUITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CONGRESS-GUNS and related stories.)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Gov. George W. Bush on Friday signed into law a bill
making it illegal for any of the state's cities or other local
governments to file suit against gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The move lands Bush, the Republican presidential front-runner,
in the middle of what is emerging as a hot-button debate in the
2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush does not believe the manufacturer of a legal product
should be held responsible for the criminal use of that product,''
said Linda Edwards, the governor's director of communications.
``This legislation seeks to curb frivolous lawsuits.''
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of gun control were quick to see Bush's action as
proof of a cozy relationship with the National Rifle Association,
which has championed similar bills in state capitals around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a question of priorities,'' said Joe Sudbay, director
of state legislation for Hand Gun Control in Washington. ``The NRA
said, We want this, and the governor showed that that's where his
loyalties lie.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill was one of more than a thousand awaiting the governor's
signature in the wake of the legislative session that adjourned on
May 31. The gun legislation had not emerged as a particularly
contentious issue in gun-friendly Texas, certainly not to the level
that Washington has become embroiled in the topic.
</P>
<P>
   Texas now becomes one of 14 states that have adopted such
legislation, passed in response to recent suits filed in New
Orleans, Atlanta and other cities.

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, June 18 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: Y2K
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday approved, 62-37, a bill that would
restrict punitive damages and class action suits against businesses
if problems arise with computers and other systems that are not
fully Year 2000 compliant. The bill would also require consumers to
wait 90 days before they could file lawsuits in such cases.
Supporters said high technology companies need protection from such
lawsuits. Opponents said the bill would leave consumers without any
recourse to recoup financial losses caused by the Y2K bug. A
``yes'' vote favors the bill.

   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: AIRPORTS
</P>
<P>
   The House on Tuesday approved, 316-110, legislation providing
$57 billion for aviation safety and improvements. The bill would
significantly increase spending for airport construction and air
traffic control facilities over the next five years. Supporters
said the funding will provide for much-needed improvements to
airport facilities. Opponents said the bill is too expensive and
endangers other spending programs and prospects for a tax cut. A
``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: PROSECUTE
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday passed, 249-181, an amendment to a larger
juvenile justice bill that imposes stricter penalties on juveniles
that commit violent crimes. Under the bill, juveniles as young as
14 could be tried as adults, and anyone caught with a gun with the
intent to bring it to school could face a maximum penalty of up to
five years incarceration. Supporters said the measures were
necessary to prevent violent crimes, such as the deadly school
shooting in Colorado. Opponents said the bill was too strict and
would undermine the possible rehabilitation of juvenile offenders.
A ``yes'' vote supports the measure.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: MEDIA
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday rejected, 146-282, an amendment to a
larger juvenile justice bill that would have made it illegal to
distribute or sell sexually explicit or violent materials to
juveniles. Supporters said the measure was necessary to restrict
juvenile access to materials that may contribute to increased
violent behavior. Opponents said the measure violated the free
speech clause of the Constitution. A ``yes'' vote supported the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: COMMAND
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 248-180, an amendment to a
larger juvenile justice bill that gives states the power to post
The Ten Commandments inside school and court buildings. Supporters
said the measure would help bring values back into both arenas and
hopefully would deter future killing sprees like the one in
Colorado. Opponents said the measure was a violation of the
separation of church and state. A ``yes'' vote supports the bill.
</P>
<P>
   5) BILL NUMBER: JUSTICE
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 287-139, a juvenile justice bill
that gives $1.5 billion to state and local governments to fight
juvenile crime and to establish prevention programs. Supporters
said that the measure was a tough, yet family-oriented, response to
the calls for stricter punishment for juvenile offenses in the wake
of the deadly school shooting in Colorado. Opponents said the bill
did not properly address the problems facing juveniles today. A
``yes'' vote supports the bill.
</P>
<P>
   6) BILL NUMBER: INSTANT
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 218-211, a measure that would
limit background checks at gun shows to 24 hours. The measure also
cuts back the number of gun shows that are subject to federal
investigation checks. Supporters said it was important to limit the
background checks because some gun shows only last a few days and
that the measure was sufficient in making sure that convicted
felons do not have access to guns. Opponents said the bill made
buying guns easier and would do nothing to prevent convicts from
getting guns. A ``yes'' vote supports the bill.
</P>
<P>
   7) BILL NUMBER: BACKGROUND
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday rejected, 193-235, a measure that would
have provided three business days for criminal background checks at
gun shows. Supporters said the bill was an effective way to keep
firearms away from criminals, people with mental illnesses and
children. Opponents said the bill was too broad and could
potentially put gun shows out of business. A ``yes'' vote supports
the measure.

INTERNET SLIDE DOESN'T FAZE FUND HOLDERS

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, JUNE 20)  
 (af)  
 By RICHARD A. APPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Managers of Internet mutual funds can thank people like Lynette
Kunz for making life a little easier.
</P>
<P>
   While Internet stocks, and the funds that invest in them, have
plunged in the last two months, fund investors have not fled _ as
so often happens when a sector is slammed so quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, like Ms. Kunz, who bought about $7,000 worth of the
Internet Fund near the sector's recent peak and is down about 10
percent, many Internet fund holders have ridden out the downdraft
so far.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kunz, of Shoreline, Wash., is not planning to bail out. ``I
thought I'd give them a good run and see what it was like after a
year,'' she said. She thinks the stocks will come back later this
year, when consumer technology spending picks up with
back-to-school and Christmas shopping. Most of her money is in
other funds and Microsoft stock, with some ``play money'' in penny
stocks, she added. ``I'm pretty diversified.''
</P>
<P>
   While Internet funds rebounded last week, rising more than 10
percent since Tuesday, they remain down sharply from highs in early
April. But more money is still flowing into Internet funds than has
been flowing out, according to the latest data.
</P>
<P>
   About $25 million of new money piled into Internet funds in the
week ended Wednesday, the lowest level this quarter, but still
surprisingly high, given that almost everyone who has put money
into an Internet fund since early April holds the position at a
loss.
</P>
<P>
   The resilience of such investors has made a tough spot tolerable
for managers of Internet funds, who have not had to sell into a
down market to meet redemptions. Until investors ``see a real
blowup in the economy, I think they're going to stay hard and
fast,'' said Lawrence York, lead portfolio manager of the WWW
Internet fund.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even managers of Internet funds caution that the recent
volatility shows why no one should put much money into their funds.
Maybe 10 percent to 15 percent for an aggressive investor, said
Paul Cook, manager of the Munder Netnet fund, the largest Internet
fund, with about $2 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kunz's manager, Ryan Jacob, stock-picker for the $654.2
million Internet Fund, added, ``We should be a small part of
someone's investment portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   The short-term outlook for the sector raises some concerns. A.
Michael Lipper, chairman of Lipper Inc., a Summit, N.J., research
firm, warns that with the scores of recent Internet initial public
offerings, Internet fund shareholders could face tough times _ a
situation reminiscent of when funds investing in real estate
investment trusts became popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially there was demand and very little supply,'' Lipper
said. ``Then the Street created a lot of supply that overwhelmed
demand, and this is what I think is happening here.''
</P>
<P>
   Managers of Internet funds are more optimistic. But they do have
decidedly different ideas about what stocks will do best.
</P>
<P>
   York splits his portfolio between mature companies, midsize
concerns and riskier, smaller ventures _ one reason that as of last
Thursday, he said, his fund was down only 16.2 percent from April
13.It also helps the portfolio's liquidity to have a lot invested
in larger companies, since trying to buy or sell even a few hundred
shares of some smaller Internet stocks can cause the brokerage
firms that make markets in such stocks to adjust their prices.
</P>
<P>
   He likes stocks like Verisign and Open Market, which sell
equipment to E-commerce concerns; companies that provide the pipe
through which Internet traffic flows, like the cable operator Time
Warner, and companies benefiting from use of the Internet for
financial transactions, like Checkfree Holdings and Security First
Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   To Cook of Munder, much of the Internet sector was due for a
correction. ``The pure plays had such a tremendous fourth quarter,
they had just gotten extended and were trading away from realistic
valuations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His favorites include E-commerce stocks like Beyond.com and
Iturf, which among other things sell software and apparel,
respectively; companies providing broadband Internet access, like
At Home, and those selling Internet equipment to businesses, like
Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
   The manager of the Monument Internet fund, Alexander Cheung,
attributes last week's spike in Internet stocks not only to the
low-inflation news on Wednesday but also to short-covering by
investors who had borrowed shares recently and sold them short,
hoping the down trend would go on.
</P>
<P>
   He is not too fond of E-commerce stocks, preferring the Internet
advertising firm Doubleclick, the audio-video software company
Realnetworks, the Internet access provider Psinet and Cisco.
E-commerce stocks may be grabbing headlines, Cheung said, but ``we
put a little bit more emphasis on infrastructure, access, service
providers and enabling technology companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacob, meanwhile, sees better value in beaten-down, less
established companies including About.com, which operates Web
sites, and Theglobe.com, which provides online services to develop
Internet content. Like the other Internet managers, he attributes a
large part of the recent slump _ and last week's bounce _ to the
interest rate outlook. But other factors have hurt, such as service
failures at Ebay, the online auctioneer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're used to volatility within this sector,'' Jacob said,
``but even a week like this can be tough to take.''

HOUSE'S GUN-CONTROL CHAMPION IS DETERMINED TO PRESS ON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Mo.)   (bl)  
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ ``Let me go home,'' came the weary plea to the
House from Rep. Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., as she watched her
gun-control measure go down to defeat in the middle of the night,
beyond the waking notice of most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me go home,'' she repeated, teary-eyed in early Friday
morning, transfixing the House in her moment of exasperation at the
bare-knuckled political machinations that befell her cause. Far
from quitting, the second-term congresswoman was vowing to work at
her new career until some progress was enacted on her signature
issue of gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McCarthy, who became a citizen-politician after she was
widowed by a gunman in a random shooting spree on New York's Long
island Rail Road in 1993, was free to go home at 2:40 p.m. Friday.
That was when the attempt by House Republican leaders to pass a
minimalist gun measure in place of her own amendment collapsed in a
furious round of Republican chagrin and cross-party recriminations.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republican moderates, crying sham, rose up to
defeat the Republican leadership's measure almost 2-to-1. The
thwack of the gavel left the House drifting off in an inconclusive
hubbub as members wondered how the nation would deal with their
inaction in the face of the schoolhouse shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm re-energized by this,'' Mrs. McCarthy said as she left the
Capitol, far from tears. She seemed every bit the resilient
professional politician as she vowed to go to the voters with a
message that the National Rifle Association had won, gutting the
issue of gun control to the point that not even a nominal measure
could pass the House as political cover for the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am Irish and I am not supposed to cry in front of anyone,''
Mrs. McCarthy had cautioned herself during Thursday's midnight
debate, when dozens of Democratic congresswomen rallied down the
aisle to her side, speaking up for slain schoolchildren and
shattered parents.
</P>
<P>
   The emotional scene was viewed by angry Republicans as political
stagecraft. ``Regular order!'' came the booming shouts of
Republican men demanding that the line of women be gaveled out of
order.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bullies!'' came the chorused response of the Democratic women.
</P>
<P>
   In this, Mrs. McCarthy was at the heart of far more than just
sisterly solidarity. With an eye for the national elections next
year, the Democrats carefully used every dominant tableau and
keynote speech this week to present gun control as a prime issue
among women alarmed for the safety of their families. In the duel
of sound bites and photo opportunities, Mrs. McCarthy led the
Democratic congresswomen in crowding maternally at the microphones,
in contrast to the Republicans' usually male-dominated offerings of
cultural jeremiads and celebrations of the rights of hunters.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Majority Whip Tom DeLay, who belittled the gun issue
and drove the culture-war argument for his party, went down
whipping. As he rallied his troops for late-night debate Thursday,
DeLay invoked the anti-Clintonism that underlies House Republican
passions. ``It does not take a village to raise a child,'' he
declared, sounding triumphalist in a rebuff to Hillary Rodham
Clinton. ``We have created a culture that raises children to kill
children.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay won his midnight skirmish as the McCarthy gun-control
measure was defeated. But he failed in the larger war Friday
afternoon as the House rejected his plea for a measure that the NRA
helped to write in the name of gun control as a device to counter a
stronger bill approved in May by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Premonitions of the outcome were in the air as lawmakers
gathered for the final vote. ``If we really want to do something,
this is our last chance!'' one member cried out. And another arose
to announce darkly, ``This House is in a state of denial.''
</P>
<P>
   In a measure of the Republican leaders' anxious state, Rep.
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the Judiciary Committee, which was
noticeably bypassed in composing the leadership bill, was
dispatched for the final rallying cry. Carefully praising Mrs.
McCarthy, Hyde pleaded the urgent case for the House to pass
something for their constituents, however imperfect.
</P>
<P>
   As the depth of the final Republican defeat mounted on the House
tally board, Rep. Jo Ann Emerson, R-Mo., the Republican woman who
carried much of the symbolic brunt in her party's floor arguments,
looked stunned in staring up mutely at the vote count. She stood
starkly alone. Across the aisle, the Democratic women huddled
together to stoke fresh resolve.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the acrid void of the final vote, with no new gun controls
passed by the House, Mrs. McCarthy indeed headed home _ as a
politician tempered in some fiery debate that seemed to suit her.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, you have a defeat, you feel tired, but the next day you go
back at it with fresh energy,'' she said, sounding eager for more
of the bittersweet lessons of her on-the-job training as a
politician.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House on Friday concluded a bitter,
wide-ranging debate over the seeds of violence among American
children by rejecting, 280 to 147, a package of new restrictions on
firearms that was significantly weaker than legislation approved by
the Senate last month.
</P>
<P>
   An odd coalition of liberal Democrats, moderate Republicans and
conservative opponents of gun control in both parties banded
together to defeat the House measures, which struck many lawmakers
as too little and many others as too much. In the end, 82
Republicans joined with 197 Democrats and one independent in
opposition to the legislation, while only 10 Democrats sided with
137 Republicans in favor of it.
</P>
<P>
   That outcome seriously clouded the prospects for the passage of
modest new gun-control measures in Congress this year and brought
to a close _ at least for now _ the long, intense weeks of
political wrangling and legislative soul-searching touched off by
the massacre at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., on April
20.
</P>
<P>
   A House juvenile crime bill that was passed on Thursday, before
the companion legislation on gun control was considered, will
proceed to a conference committee to be reconciled with a Senate
juvenile crime bill that comprised an array of modest new
restrictions on firearms.
</P>
<P>
   But that could be many weeks away, and the absence of gun
control in the House version makes it unclear how much, if any, of
the Senate measures will survive. House Democrats vowed to push
their cause in other ways and perhaps use parliamentary maneuvers
to bring back to the House floor stronger gun-control provisions
than the ones they opposed today.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll use every method we can,'' said Rep. Dick Gephardt of
Missouri, the Democratic minority leader.
</P>
<P>
   The House has traditionally proven more resistant to gun control
than the Senate, but Friday's defeat also reflected the
relentlessly building war between Republicans and Democrats as they
head into the 2000 elections, when control of the House as well as
the White House is up for grabs. The political calculations of each
party helped to doom any kind of consensus, and the finger pointing
began almost instantly after the final vote.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said that they had succeeded in blocking and exposing
a Republican deception of progress that, in fact, relaxed a number
of aspects of current gun-control law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House leadership gutted this bill in the dark of night,''
President Clinton said Friday, referring to a vote at midnight
Thursday for the most lenient of several proposals to regulate the
sale of firearms at gun shows. It was the passage of this measure,
supported by House Republican leaders and the National Rifle
Association, that stirred such solid Democratic opposition to the
final gun-control bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our nation is waiting for Washington to pass a real law that
keeps guns away from children and out of the hands of children,''
Clinton said. ``I call on Congress to stop playing politics and
start living up to its responsibility to save lives.''
</P>
<P>
   But House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, an Illinois Republican,
accused Democrats of the same games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let there be no mistake,'' said Hastert, who did not join
other Republican leaders at a news conference following the vote,
in a written statement. ``The vast majority of the Democratic
caucus walked away when they had the chance to walk forward for the
good of the country.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats' opposition to the bill stemmed from the stinging
defeat, around 1 a.m. Friday, of a measure sponsored by Rep.
Carolyn McCarthy, D-N.Y., to require mandatory background checks on
all buyers at gun shows. Mrs. McCarthy's measure, which largely
mirrored the Senate legislation, defined gun shows broadly and gave
vendors up to three business days to conduct those checks.
</P>
<P>
   But the House defeated it only an hour after narrowly approving
a rival gun-show measure that was sponsored by Rep. John D.
Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, that relaxed current law in some
ways. Dingell formerly served on the board of the NRA.
</P>
<P>
   His measure, like Mrs. McCarthy's, obliged the 40 percent of
vendors at gun shows who are hobbyists or collectors to conduct the
kinds of background checks that only the 60 percent of sellers who
are licensed dealers must now perform. But it gave both these
groups only 24 hours before the sale would be allowed to go
through. Licensed dealers currently have three business days.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   All the Republican leaders in the House voted with Dingell, and
in the minutes between his victory and Mrs. McCarthy's defeat,
which was all but certain at that point, she choked back tears as
she addressed her colleagues from the well of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McCarthy, whose husband was killed and her son critically
injured by a gunman on the Long Island Rail Road in 1993, said, ``I
made a promise to my son and to my husband.'' The nature of that
vow was implicit as she added, ``If there was anything that I could
do to prevent one family from going through what I have gone
through and every other victim that I know have gone through, then
I have done my job.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McCarthy drew a standing ovation, even from many of the
Republicans and conservative Democrats who then voted against her
proposal, which was defeated, 253 to 193. Dingell's measure had
passed by a vote of 218 to 211.

 &HT;    Ivester takes charge in Belgium
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Time may be money, but to Coca-Cola these days it
represents priceless image.
</P>
<P>
   The longer the European health scare involving Coca-Cola's soft
drinks drags on, the more damaging it can become for arguably the
best-known brand in the world.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason company Chairman M. Douglas Ivester is in
Europe this weekend to take personal command of the situation.
</P>
<P>
   And several industry observers predict Ivester will be able to
help end the company's crisis, possibly early next week. On Monday,
he is expected to meet with the Belgian government, according to
government and company officials.
</P>
<P>
   Belgian and French authorities have questioned Coca-Cola's
explanations of what caused scores of illnesses to consumers who
drank its products. Both countries, along with several other
European nations, have pulled Coke products or curtailed shipments
in recent days.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola blamed the sicknesses on two causes: defective carbon
dioxide injected into drinks at a plant in Antwerp, Belgium, and an
offensive odor on the outside bottom of cans produced at a plant in
Dunkirk, France. The company said the odor originated from a
fungicide sprayed on wooden pallets carrying cans that were sent to
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   But both governments said more testing and data are needed to
demonstrate that the company's explanations are accurate before the
partial ban on its products can be lifted. ``I think that's a PR
disaster,'' said Marc Cohen, a beverage analyst for Goldman Sachs.
``The Belgian Health Ministry is not accepting what their analysis
is yielding. ... It must be enormously frustrating for the
company.''
</P>
<P>
   But frustration is the least of the company's problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``In part of their business, they're out of business,'' Cohen
said. ``The longer this goes on, the more damage it does to their
reputation and their business.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said it's a challenge for the company to get government
officials to move quicker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure what's in their control,'' he said. But with
Ivester in Belgium now, events are likely to speed up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a positive thing that Doug is visibly involved. People
always take confidence in a CEO that's standing up and facing the
issue,'' Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   At a minimum, however, the crisis will go into a second week.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry analysts believe Coca-Cola needs to resolve the
issues by the end of next week or the road back to regaining public
confidence could get considerably rougher.
</P>
<P>
   Other analysts, however, believe the largest beverage company in
the world has the ability to steadily rebound _ even if it takes a
longer time to get its products back on the shelves.
</P>
<P>
   They said that's partially because Coca-Cola will have a number
of aggressive marketing and advertising initiatives when the
governments give the green light.
</P>
<P>
   ``The brand is very strong and has an enduring nature,'' said
John Sicher, editor and publisher of Beverage Digest. ``Long term,
I don't anticipate problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, Cohen agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The $64,000 question is the lasting impact with the customer
and the consumer,'' he said. ``I suspect there won't be.''

 WASHINGTON: 218 to 211.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The House went on Friday to consider, and approve, a host of
other gun-control measures, many of them identical to the Senate's.
They included a requirement that licensed dealers provide
child-safety devices with all the handguns they sold, new
restrictions on the possession of semi-automatic rifles by children
under 18, and a ban on the import of high-capacity ammunition
clips.
</P>
<P>
   But the House also approved a proposal to create an exemption
under the District of Columbia's ban on firearms possession that
would allow people without criminal histories to keep a gun at
home.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, most Democrats said that because the weakness of
Dingell's gun-show provision eclipsed the strengths in some of the
other measures they decided to vote against the bill that stitched
them all together.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many conservative of both parties who had
voted with Dingell so disliked the additional restrictions on
firearms that passed that they abandoned the bill for the opposite
reason.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle were Republican leaders who felt a need to show
that they could pass a bill and even many conservative Republicans
who wanted to pass legislation and ensure that they would not have
to return to the subject of guns anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   They also wanted to show that Hastert could marshal his unruly
caucus, with its narrow majority, toward the enactment of
legislation. Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the Republican majority whip,
lobbied conservatives in his party to accept the new firearms
restrictions and even voted for them himself, though he had made
clear all week long how odious he found them.
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, who also voted for the bill, sat down with moderate
Republicans just an hour before the vote, urging them to support
the legislation, according to Rep. Amo Houghton, a Republican from
New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that it was important that we got something done and
not let it go down and have wasted all this time posturing,'' said
Houghton, who voted for the bill. ``I'm sure he was very concerned
that here was another handful of sand in the gears, when we needed
some lubrication.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the NRA recommended the legislation's approval in a
last-minute letter to lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   James Jay Baker, the chief lobbyist for the organization, said
Friday that the NRA had cared most about defeating Mrs. McCarthy's
gun-show amendment and promoting Dingell's. Having accomplished
that, he said, the rifle association was willing to live with the
other restrictions that had been woven into the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought, on balance, it was better to get this issue over
and done with,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic leaders decided to oppose the bill, and the party
hung together more solidly in the final vote on the bill than they
had on the rival gun-show measures.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., conceded that some Democrats who had
broken party ranks on other votes simply decided that ``they wanted
to screw up the Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats also kept many Republican advocates of gun control,
like Rep. Christopher Shays of Connecticut, on their side. Shays,
in a floor speech just before his vote to kill the bill, explained
his decision in terms of the flaws in Dingell's measure and the gun
lobby's sway over that proposal and the Republican majority voting
for the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope, in my lifetime, the marriage between the NRA and my
party ends in divorce,'' Shays said. ``It's a bad marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference after the vote, DeLay said he was actually
pleased with the result.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guns have little or nothing to do with juvenile
violence,'' DeLay said, adding that he ``had a great time this
week'' getting to debate other causes, like children's estrangement
from religion and the violent wares peddled by the entertainment
industry.

NATO-MOSCOW TIES BEGAN WORSENING BEFORE BOMBING 
</HEADLINE>
   (Exclusive)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ A few hundred Russian soldiers in Kosovo,
commanded by a general who outranks the British lieutenant general
who will be in charge of the 50,000 NATO troops there, have had the
alliance trying to figure out since last weekend how Russians can
be included without being under NATO command, which they reject, or
weakening the mission.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, allied officials said Friday, NATO's military
relationship with Russia started going seriously wrong months ago,
when Moscow tried to assign a senior military intelligence officer
to the alliance's command headquarters in Mons, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Ostensibly, the officer, Maj. Gen. Roman Yepifanov, was to have
coordinated with NATO orders to the 1,300 Russian troops in Bosnia.
But more likely, the allies thought, he was sent to spy.
</P>
<P>
   The allied military commander, Gen. Wesley Clark of the United
States, objected to the appointment, diplomats here said, and tried
informally to persuade senior Russian military officials to send
somebody else. Alliance ambassadors backed Clark and formally
rejected Yepifanov's assignment in February, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Given the cold shoulder in Brussels, Yepifanov, considered by
his intelligence counterparts in NATO to have no evident
qualifications to command troops in the field in Bosnia, went there
anyway and is apparently still in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for NATO in Sarajevo, Col. Lee Hockman, said
Yepifanov was a special representative of the chief of staff of the
Russian airborne forces, the bulk of the Russian peacekeepers in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had absolutely no previous operational command experience
that would have qualified him to direct peacekeeping operations in
Bosnia,'' an allied diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after Yepifanov's rejection, Russia froze all military
relations with the alliance to protest the NATO bombing of
Yugoslavia that started on March 24. Consequently, the Russian
forces in Bosnia technically have no one to report to at Clark's
headquarters, which may explain why some of them simply pulled out
of Bosnia last week and headed for Kosovo, infuriating Clark.
</P>
<P>
   The man whom Yepifanov was nominated to replace, Maj. Gen.
Anatoly Krivolapov, was abruptly pulled back to Moscow at the turn
of the year, with no explanation to his NATO counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Krivolapov was effective, and Clark had a professional
association with him,'' one allied officer said. ``They met once
every week or two and discussed serious military matters. And we
saw him as a very successful appointment. All of a sudden he got
orders to leave, and ever since the post has been vacant.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not the only vacant post. The officer who was Russia's
military representative to the alliance until the NATO bombing
started, Lt. Gen. Viktor Zavarzin, turned up a week ago at the
airport near Pristina, Kosovo, in command of the Russian troops who
arrived in the dead of night determined to seize a role in the
security force.
</P>
<P>
   Not even Clark, with all the infrared sensors and spy satellites
his air forces had used to such great effect in the 78 days of the
bombing, was aware that the Russian soldiers moved into Pristina
early last Saturday until they arrived there, to a huge welcome
from the city's Serbs, allied officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Zavarzin, freshly promoted to four-star colonel general rank,
not only outran the British commander of the allied peacekeeping
force, Lt. Gen. Sir Michael Jackson, he even outranked him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hadn't seen him in Brussels since the bombing started,''
said a Russian journalist who covers NATO, hugely amused at the
whole show.
</P>
<P>
   Zavarzin had been sent to Brussels under the 1997 treaty that
established a formal relationship between the alliance and Russia
despite Moscow's vehement objections to Poland, Hungary and the
Czech Republic's joining NATO. The three former Warsaw Pact allies
of the Soviet Union became NATO members just before the Yugoslavia
bombardment started.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO and Russia do not consider each other as adversaries,''
the treaty, signed by President Boris Yeltsin in Paris, says. It
provides for a Russian mission to NATO and an ambassador, with a
senior military representative _ still Zavarzin _ as part of the
mission for what the treaty describes as ``military cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   With taut grins on their faces, allied diplomats have been
maintaining for a week that they were happy to see that Russia was
so eager for military cooperation with the alliance in Kosovo that
it had dispatched Zavarzin to Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   But American officials have been so infuriated that Foreign
Minister Hubert Vedrine of France told journalists in Paris this
week that he thought that the Americans should not exaggerate the
importance of the affair. The Russian military, humiliated and
broke since the end of the Cold War, was simply trying to show that
it was not a complete cipher. Give 'em a break, Vedrine said in
effect.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and Secretary of Defense
William Cohen were in Helsinki, Finland, for a second straight day
Friday trying to untangle the mess. Their talks produced agreement
on command arrangements for an estimated 3,600 Russian troops in
Kosovo to report technically to a Russian officer at Clark's
headquarters in Mons, allied diplomats said. A Russian military
representative would also be assigned to NATO's Southern Europe
Command in Naples.
</P>
<P>
   The setup in Kosovo would be similar to the one under which the
1,300 Russian troops in Bosnia serve with, but not technically for,
the NATO force there. The Russian commander in Bosnia, Col. Nikolai
Ignatov, coordinates day-to-day operations with the American
officer who heads the multinational NATO division headquartered in
Tuzla, Maj. Gen. Kevin Byrnes. But formally Ignatov had been taking
orders from Krivolapov as a special deputy to Clark.
</P>
<P>
   In Kosovo, allied diplomats said, the Russians will have a
high-ranking officer who will be a special deputy to Jackson in his
role as commander of the British contingent. That will allow the
Russians to maintain that they are technically not subordinating
their troops to NATO orders. At least, allied diplomats said, it
will mean that Moscow, after a two-month freeze, is finally willing
to resume relations, good or bad, with the alliance.

 _ SF CHRON  
 War Birds Without Talons  &HT;     By Rebecca Smith 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
To Randy Howell and Jerry Gallud, the MiG-17s that they will be
flying this weekend at the Moffett Air Show are the airborne
equivalents of 1950s muscle cars. Eye-catching, fire-spitting
aerobatic hot rods that climb like rockets and descend at speeds
that could rip a hole in the sound barrier (if the FAA would let
them).
<P>
   Two years ago, the United Airlines pilots who have been
waterskiing buddies for 20 years and have been flying stunt planes
for most of that time, heard that an aviator friend had run across
four snub-nosed MiG-17 fighters that had been decommissioned by the
Polish air force and were for sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want four MiG-17s,'' Howell says with a sigh. ``I
really only wanted one, but it was pretty much a package deal.''
</P>
<P>
   After thousands of hours of labor and an undisclosed investment,
the two pilots finally have the fighter jets on in &LR;   &LR; the air show
circuit. To help fund their passion, the fliers recently signed a
deal with Stolichnaya, a Russian vodka company. ``Stoli'' will
cover MiG costs in exchange for exclusive promotional rights.
</P>
<P>
   Repainted a flaming red last month to match the scarlet on
Stolichnaya labels, the jets were rechristened the ``Stoli MiGs''
early this month and made their debut at the Paso Robles Air Show
in San Louis Obispo County.
</P>
<P>
   For Howell and Gallud, the course they have traveled the past
two years could not have been summarized in a single flight plan.
It has involved lots of side trips and course corrections.
</P>
<P>
   It started when they first heard the MiGs were on the auction
block. They were among the thousands of Mikoyan-Gurevich (``MiG'')
war birds built by the Soviet Union after following &LR;   &LR; World War II
and dispatched to Soviet flying forces and allies in Eastern
Europe, North Korea, North Vietnam, Cuba and China.
</P>
<P>
   For two generations of American and NATO fliers, MiGs were the
nemesis, the shadowy, nimble fighters to be feared and outfoxed.
But, with the collapse of the Soviet Union, a small number of the
planes began showing up on the collectors' market. Howell bought a
MiG trainer jet, an L-29, six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  According to the Federal Aviation Administration, there are
20 MiGs in private hands in the United States. They are listed on
the FAA's civil aircraft registry.
</P>
<P>
   For a price they will not disclose, Howell and Gallud grabbed
all four Cold War relics, not really having any idea what it would
cost to get them flying again or how they would pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   They were disassembled and shipped in 40-foot containers to the
Port of Oakland, where federal agents for the Department &LR;   &LR; Bureau
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms disabled the planes' 23mm and 37mm
guns. From Oakland, the aeronautic oddities were transported to the
pilots' hangar at Byron Airport, nestled in a break in the Contra
Costa County hills. beyond Livermore. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Word spread quickly, from aviator to aviator, that four MiGs
were being refurbished in Byron. Steve Magnuson, a former jet
mechanic for United Airlines, came for a look and wound up spending
hundreds of hours helping rebuild the late '50s planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was remarkable to see a piece of history sitting in the
hangar. Real MiGs,'' says Magnuson who has since become Howell and
Gallud's crew chief, responsible for maintaining the jets and
prepping them for air shows. ``They were in such rough shape I
didn't think they'd ever fly again.''
</P>
<P>
   Getting MiGs certified to fly in U.S. airspace is not easy. It
took 4,000 four thousand  &LR; hours of labor to get the first two MiGs
in flying shape. In addition to big things like rebuilding the jet
engines, there were myriad small tasks like relabeling the Cyrillic
control panels in the single-seater jets.
</P>
<P>
   As the planes got close to being ready to fly, Howell and Gallud
began training on an older-generation MiG-15 two-seater they found
in Reno.
</P>
<P>
   The inaugural flights, though long anticipated, were not exactly
joyrides. After taking the jets up, the men went through a lengthy
checklist of maneuvers, each learning his plane's exact
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an awesome feeling,'' says Howell. ``To finally be in
the air.''
</P>
<P>
   On successive flights, Howell and Gallud practiced the aerobatic
maneuvers that now are part of the team's performance repertoire:
loops, vertical rolls, crossover passes and so forth.
</P>
<P>
   All technical systems were go, but there was a major financial
glitch at Red Star Airshows, the company they formed. MiGs, unlike
muscle cars, can't be topped off for $20.
</P>
<P>
   The pugnacious-looking jets, with 7,900 pounds of thrust, guzzle
1,000 gallons of jet fuel an hour compared with 12 to 15 gallons
for the small stunt planes the pilots had flown at other air shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would definitely go broke if we were trying to keep them
flying with the money we make at air shows,'' says Gallud, who,
like Howell, learned to fly by taking private flight lessons, not
by joining the Navy or Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   The motto of the flying community might as well be ``Will fly
for fuel,'' since many performers make appearances in exchange for
nothing more than a hotel room and jet fuel.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear that they needed a corporate sponsor to cover
hangar and crew team costs. They hired a New York promotions firm
and, this spring, Stolichnaya agreed to sponsor the flying team
under a one-year contract with an option to renew.
</P>
<P>
   For Stolichnaya, the fit seemed as natural as an olive in a
martini glass.
</P>
<P>
   The No.5 vodka in the United States, Stolichnaya is being
marketed to 21-to-34-year-old drinkers who gravitate toward premium
spirits like ``Stoli'' and Absolut, the No.2 brand, that sell for
twice as much as market-leading Smirnoff.
</P>
<P>
   United Distillers and Vintners, the British-owned company that
markets Stolichnaya in this country, is trying to develop a hip
image for Stolichnaya, using contemporary Russian art in its
advertisements that say the vodka is ``as authentic as the soul of
Russia herself.''
</P>
<P>
   When he heard the MiG pilots were looking for a corporate
sponsor, United Distillers executive Peter Heyworth was enormously
intrigued.
</P>
<P>
   ``The MiG is an icon of Russia and Stolichnaya is an authentic
Russian product with a lot of heritage,'' says Heyworth. ``It's not
often in marketing that you get such a close fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Though they were not feeling very picky about patrons, the
pilots nevertheless were relieved when Stoli came forward.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Heyworth was surprised to discover there are not
many corporate sponsorships of air shows or stunt teams. ``It's one
of the few uncluttered media left,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Moffett Field, the MiGs will do fly overs &LR; 
 &LR; flyovers next Sunday at the San Francisco gay pride parade, for
which Stolichnaya is major sponsor, and will perform a 10-minute
stunt routine at the Marysville Air Show in Yuba County, also next
weekend. Other appearances are listed on their site on the World
Wide Web at  &LR; redstarmigs.com &LR; .)
</P>
<P>
   Like championship wresting, air show promoters find it
irresistible to have Yankee fighters like the F-86cq  &LR;  fly with its
alter ego, the MiG-17. Hokey, perhaps, but Howell and Gallud aren't
complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get to go up and pull some G's,'' says Howell. ``We
couldn't be happier.''

CONCERN ABOUT COKE PRODUCTS SPREADS TO SPAIN AND GERMANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As health concerns about Coca-Cola products spread to Spain and
Germany, the company's top executive flew to Brussels on Friday to
try to solve the growing public-relations problem that began a week
ago when Belgians fell ill after drinking Coke.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Co. chairman and chief executive M. Douglas Ivester
arrived in the Belgian capital to assure the public and government
officials that Coke's products were safe to drink. But the company
is being criticized as slow to respond to a crisis, one that
increasingly appears to be born of panic rather than reports of
serious illness. At risk is the reputation of the world's
best-known brand.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like the worst of all worlds for them,'' said Emanuel
Goldman, a global consumer-products analyst for Merrill Lynch.
``Coke is associated with purity. You go to a Third World country
where you're not sure of the water, and you drink Coca-Cola.''
</P>
<P>
   Germany warned consumers Friday to avoid any Coke products not
manufactured in Germany in case some from bottling plants in
Belgium or France, where the problems began, had crossed the
border, Bloomberg Business News said.
</P>
<P>
   Spain took stronger action, as regional health officials removed
cans and bottles of imported Coca-Cola products from stores.
Coca-Cola Espana, the company's division in Spain, took out
full-page newspaper advertisements saying the products made in
Spain ``have a full health guarantee and pose no risk for
consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish Health Ministry insisted that Coke products
manufactured in Spain were safe to drink, but the regional actions
suggest that officials are not convinced that the problems in
Belgium have been eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bloomberg also cited reports that the original
illness among Belgian schoolchildren who drank Coke might have been
caused by some other food contamination or something other than the
defective carbon dioxide cited by Coke.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, the Belgian government, already skittish after a
dioxin scare on animal feed helped defeat the prime minister last
weekend, ordered Coca-Cola to recall all its products. More than 50
people, including 31 schoolchildren, had complained of headaches,
nausea and vomiting after drinking Coke the previous week. The
company said soon afterward that it had traced the problems to two
bottling plants, one in Antwerp and the other in Dunkirk, France.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the government of Luxembourg imposed its own ban,
and health officials in France told Coke to recall all canned soft
drinks produced in Dunkirk. The Netherlands also ordered a recall
of any Coke products that had been distributed through Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   Belgium and France have lifted the ban on most Coke products,
but one remains on Coca-Cola, Sprite and Fanta _ the company's
biggest sellers. France has also asked Coke to provide more data
that flawed carbon dioxide caused the problems at the Antwerp plant
and that a substance on wooden pallets used to transport cans of
Coke was at fault in the bottling plant in Dunkirk, whose products
show up across Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Baskin, a spokesman for Coca-Cola in Atlanta, its home base,
said research by the company ``indicates that consumers understand
the situation and are acting far less irrationally than some of the
press reports might seem to indicate.'' He added that products made
in Belgium were rarely shipped to Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman of Merrill Lynch said: ``You want things pan-European,
but clearly there's a downside. The good news is, the products go
all over. The bad news is, the products go all over.''
</P>
<P>
   Absent reports of serious illness, Coke's biggest problem
becomes isolating the public relations damage. ``Their worry is
image, and a spillover to other countries,'' Goldman said. ``More
than anything, the company needs to make sure people view this as
an aberration.''
</P>
<P>
   Baskin said some of the recalled cans and bottles were being
destroyed. ``There are some markets where we've been asked to take
product off the shelf and destroy it, and that's what we're
doing,'' he said. ``In other markets, we've been asked not to ship
product.'' He said he did not know which policy was in practice in
which markets. He added that the company would reimburse anyone
whose doctor indicated that an illness was caused by drinking
Coca-Cola. He said he did not know if anyone had been reimbursed.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Enterprises, the giant Coke bottler that controls
production in Belgium, Luxembourg and the Netherlands as well as
most of France, has been noticeably silent. Several telephone
messages left for a company spokeswoman at the Atlanta headquarters
were not returned this week, and statements have been almost
entirely limited to Coca-Cola employees.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps signaling a shift, Dominique Reineiche, the president of
the bottler's French unit, Coca-Cola France, held a news conference
Friday in Paris. ``We still haven't estimated the cost to us in
lost sales, but it will be considerable,'' said Ms. Reineiche, The
Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Enterprises, spun off as a public company in 1986, is
about 40 percent owned by Coca-Cola and has been acquiring bottlers
rapidly in recent years. Coca-Cola makes the concentrate that is
used to make soft drinks, but the drinks are produced and
distributed by Coca-Cola Enterprises and other bottlers.
</P>
<P>
   Baskin, the Coke spokesman, said he could not comment on what
Coca-Cola Enterprises was doing. But he noted that ``it's one
system, and the trademarks are the property of the Coca-Cola
Company.''
</P>
<P>
   Several analysts said it was appropriate for Coca-Cola to take
the lead in managing the crisis. ``You have to come out with one
voice for the Coke system,'' said Bill Pecoriello, of Sanford C.
Bernstein &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there may have been an early breakdown in communications
between the two companies that caused a delay in the corporate
response.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, shares of Coca-Cola fell $1.125, to $63.4375, and shares
of Coca-Cola Enterprises slipped $1.25, to $32.125.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola Enterprises will bear the brunt of expenses associated
with the recall. ``They have indicated there will be charges
against earnings,'' Goldman said, adding that he did not know the
amount. Coca-Cola's earnings are unlikely to be affected unless the
ban is prolonged.
</P>
<P>
   Pecoriello said Coca-Cola would have to move into high marketing
gear once its products are for sale everywhere again. ``The
business is still very seasonal in Europe, but this is the peak
season,'' he said. ``These are very important months for the
company.''

WOMEN ' S WORLD CUP IS A BIG-STADIUM SELLOUT 
</HEADLINE>
  (kd) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Women's World Cup of soccer, once planned for small stadiums
on the East Coast, will instead open Saturday before what is
expected to be the largest audience ever to attend a female
sporting event in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   All 77,716 seats at Giants Stadium have been sold for a
doubleheader featuring the United States versus Denmark and Brazil
versus Mexico, organizers said Friday. That total surpasses the
76,489 who attended the gold-medal game at the 1996 Summer
Olympics, where the American women prevailed over China in Athens,
Ga.
</P>
<P>
   That Olympic crowd, many have argued, was inflated by the
ravenous desire of spectators to attend any available event at the
Summer Games. But the World Cup is a stand-alone tournament, and
Saturday's sellout amounts to an affirmation of the insistent
belief of American players and organizers that women's sports can
attract a mass audience. A second doubleheader Saturday, China
versus Sweden and Japan versus Canada, is expected to fill 20,000
of the 26,000 seats at Spartan Stadium in San Jose, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally,'' said Julie Foudy, the American co-captain. ``We've
been predicting this all along. The biggest hindrance in promoting
the women's game is that they're afraid it won't draw. I hope this
encourages people to put on other events like this, not just for
soccer.''
</P>
<P>
   However, even Marla Messing, president of the Women's World Cup
organizing committee, admitted Friday that she stepped onto a risky
limb in the fall of 1997, when she announced that the 16-team
tournament would be moved from small stadiums to the same cavernous
football arenas used for the men's World Cup in 1994. Some senior
soccer officials in the United States thought the idea of filling
big stadiums was ludicrous and that organizers were setting
themselves up for a huge embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hanging out there,'' Messing said. ``I said we would
have sellouts or near-sellouts. I felt certain about the
near-sellouts. But actually selling out a big stadium, I don't
think I ever envisioned that.''
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago, Joseph (Sepp) Blatter, who has since become
president of FIFA, soccer's world governing body, declared that
``the future is feminine.'' But even Blatter could not have
realized that the possibilities would be so immediate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Organizers have sold more than 460,000 tickets so far to the
Women's World Cup, which eclipses the 300,527 tickets sold for the
1999 women's collegiate basketball tournament, the previous
standard for women's sporting events in the United States. A sale
of half a million tickets has been predicted, and there is a
confident feeling that the attendance of 510,000 at the inaugural
Women's World Cup in China in 1991 will be surpassed, making the
1999 World Cup the largest sporting event ever held for women. The
China figure is considered unreliable anyway, because workers were
given tickets and told to attend matches.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States reaches the final on July 10, as expected,
organizers believe they can sell out the Rose Bowl's 92,542 seats,
a number made more impressive by the fact that only 113,000 tickets
were sold to the entire 1995 Women's World Cup in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   While NBC showed only highlights of the American soccer team
winning the gold medal in 1996, all 32 matches of the 1999 Women's
World Cup will be telecast by ABC, ESPN and ESPN2. A cumulative
worldwide television audience of 1 billion is expected, organizers
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a look into the future,'' said Tony DiCicco, coach of
the women's national team. ``We are only scratching the surface
with women's athletics.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the buoyant expectations, however, the success of the
1999 Women's World Cup is pegged largely on the success of the
American women, who managed only a bronze medal in 1995 after
losing to Norway, the eventual champion, in the semifinals. In the
unlikely event of an early American exit, interest would likely
plummet and the event could become a financial and public relations
failure.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the U.S. is in the final, we think we can sell out the Rose
Bowl,'' said Alan I. Rothenberg, the chief organizer of the 1994
men's World Cup and chairman of the 1999 Women's World Cup. ``If
they don't, there will be fewer people because some of us will have
slit our throats.''
</P>
<P>
   An early failure by the Americans could also ruin the cautious
hopes for a women's professional league in the United States,
beginning in 2001. Even a victory by the United States, however,
won't guarantee the viability of a women's league. One of the
professional women's basketball leagues has gone under, and the
surviving Women's National Basketball Association exists with the
support of the strongly entrenched NBA Major League Soccer, the
nascent men's league, is still struggling to maintain itself and
may not be capable of starting a women's division.
</P>
<P>
   The American women feel a professional league is vital to their
continued success. The rest of the world is catching up in terms of
finances and participation; countries such as Germany, Japan and
Brazil have thriving women's soccer leagues. In the United States,
by contrast, there is nothing to sustain female players after
college if they do not make the national team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's imperative that a league happen for women's soccer to
continue to compete at this level,'' said defender Joy Fawcett.
</P>
<P>
   Other teams in the Women's World Cup are looking to increase the
visibility of the game in their countries and, in the case of some,
are looking to eradicate negative stereotypes about women playing
soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mexican women have always been behind soccer, mostly as
spectators, and they have taken a beating _ not physically, but
emotionally _ depending on how their men's favorite team did,''
said Leo Cuellar, coach of the Mexican women's team. ``I think
millions of Latin women are looking for ways to express themselves.
Soccer is a way to say: `I'm tired of being behind. I want to put
on the shorts and shoes and shirt and go out and kick the ball.'''
</P>
<P>
   Anticipating Saturday's sellout, the American women have
practiced recently with simulated crowd noise, getting accustomed
to signaling each other when it becomes impossible to hear the ball
being kicked or a teammate shouting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will be a huge advantage to play in front of a
crowd that's 99.9 percent American,'' said goalkeeper Briana
Scurry. ``Denmark could come out shellshocked to see the crowd. If
they aren't ready, it could be a long afternoon.'' &QL;

OSWALD TIPPO, A BOTANIST AND CHANCELLOR AT MASSACHUSETTS, DIES AT
87  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Calif., Maine, Ill., Colo., Conn.)   By NICK RAVO

<P>
   Oswald Tippo, a former provost and botany professor at the
University of Massachusetts at Amherst and the first chancellor
there, died on June 10 at a hospital in Santa Barbara, Calif. He
was 87 and lived in Amherst. He was in Santa Barbara for a
grandchild's wedding.
</P>
<P>
   He was provost from 1964 until becoming chancellor in 1970,
serving one year. He was later named commonwealth professor of
botany and taught until retiring in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Tippo, a native of Milo, Me., graduated in 1932 from
Massachusetts State College, which later became the University of
Massachusetts. He received a master's degree in 1933 and a
doctorate in 1937 from Harvard University. He joined the botany
department of the University of Illinois, where he later was
chairman of the department, chairman of the division of biological
sciences and dean of the graduate school.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, he was appointed Eaton professor of botany at Yale
University. Five years later, he became provost at the University
of Colorado. In 1963, he was named executive dean of arts and
sciences at New York University.
</P>
<P>
   Tippo was the author, with H.J. Fuller, of a widely used text,
``College Botany'' (Henry Holt and Co. 1949). He was a fellow of
the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and a member of the
American Association for the Advancement of Science and the
Botanical Society of America, serving as its president in 1955.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Emmie, a son, Denis, of Avon, Conn.,
a brother, Edward Tippo of Walpole, Mass., four grandchildren, and
four step-grandchildren.

LONG-TERM CAPITAL PLANS TO CASH OUT ORIGINAL INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Long-Term Capital Management, the giant celebrity-studded hedge
fund whose near-collapse last fall sparked concerns about an
impending global market failure, is preparing to redeem investments
made five years ago by its original outside partners, wealthy
individuals and institutions that will wind up getting, on average,
considerably less than they would have earned in a plain-vanilla
stock index mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter distributed on Wednesday, Long-Term Capital, based
in Greenwich, Conn., notified its original 1994 investors that it
would cash out their stake in the $4.7 billion fund ``in the near
future.''
</P>
<P>
   That redemption, combined with cash distributed to those
investors at the end of 1997, will produce a total average annual
return of roughly 18.7 percent. During the same five-year period,
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 stock index gained an average of 26.48
percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the fund's return does not include the debatable
value of a ringside seat at one of capitalism's most exciting
eleventh-hour rescues.
</P>
<P>
   And while the payment will close the books on the original
investors' experience, it is not clear how this drama will end for
the fund's rescuers, some of Wall Street's largest institutions,
and for its founding partners, who are already discussing forming a
new money-management venture.
</P>
<P>
   The hedge fund, founded in mid-1994 by a bond-market star, John
Meriwether of Salomon Brothers, seemed to be touched by magic in
its first three years of operation, enhancing Meriwether's already
formidable reputation and generating wealth for his partners, who
included two Nobel Prize-winning economists.
</P>
<P>
   Every dollar invested in the fund in 1994 was worth $2.82 by the
end of 1997, when $1.82 of those gains were distributed to outside
investors.
</P>
<P>
   As 1998 opened, the fund's managers had combined the $4.8
billion left in the fund with oceans of borrowed cash to accumulate
a staggeringly complex portfolio worth about $125 billion. The
portfolio was intended largely to exploit small deviations in the
historic relationships among various interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   But in August, a debt crisis in Russia set off a worldwide
scramble for the safety of U.S. Treasury securities, distorting
interest-rate patterns. The hedge fund's interest-rate bets
suddenly began to plunge in value, ultimately wiping out 91 cents
of every dollar that had been left in the fund at the beginning of
1998.
</P>
<P>
   By late September, regulators were confronted with the
possibility that the sudden liquidation of the hedge fund's huge
portfolio would touch off panic in an already fragile and
frightened global marketplace. Consequently, officials at the New
York Federal Reserve Bank helped 14 banks and brokerage houses form
a consortium to make an emergency $3.6 billion investment in the
fund.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan the rescuers got a 90 percent stake in the fund,
reducing the original outside investors' stake to just under 10
percent, with Meriwether and the other managing partners retaining
only a tiny sliver of equity.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, markets have stabilized, and the fund has steadily
reduced the riskiness of its holdings and improved its investment
results. It announced in March that it had gained roughly 20
percent since the bailout, and that it expected to be able to
return some of its rescuers' capital later this year.
</P>
<P>
   People briefed on the fund's plan said that Wednesday's letter
was an outgrowth of the plan to return capital to the consortium.
</P>
<P>
   But, in addition, the redemption moved Meriwether slightly
closer to the day when he could be free of the consortium's
involvement in the fund he founded. In addition to cashing out the
original investors, the fund will also be making a partial payment
to the consortium that bailed it out in September.
</P>
<P>
   One person familiar with the plan said that somewhere in the
neighborhood of $500 million would be distributed to the
consortium, which includes Bankers Trust Corp., Chase Manhattan
Corp., Goldman Sachs Group, Lehman Brothers Holdings, Merrill Lynch
&AMP; Co., J.P. Morgan &AMP; Co., Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co., and
Citigroup, along with six European banks.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone involved with hedge fund will fare as well as the
original investors, who included top Wall Street executives, as
well as a unit of the Bank of Italy. Various Merrill Lynch
executives in that company's deferred compensation plan began tying
their future earnings to the then-impressive hedge fund's results
in April 1998 _ rather like boarding the Titanic just in time for
the iceberg collision. They missed the handsome cash distributions,
and apparently will suffer the full damage of the subsequent
meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Meriwether and the other founding partners of
Long-Term Capital also saw their equity in the fund virtually
evaporate in the course of last fall's rescue.
</P>
<P>
   But the damage done to the bank accounts and professional
reputations of the founding partners does not seem to have
dissolved the glue that binds them to Meriwether.
</P>
<P>
   People who have been told the contents of e-mail that has
circulated at the fund's offices in Greenwich say that at least
five of Meriwether's original colleagues from the Salomon Brothers
bond desk _ Eric Rosenfeld, Lawrence Hilibrand, Richard Leahy,
Victor Hagani and Arjun Krishnamachar _ have agreed to join him in
exploring the possibility of forming some new investment venture
within the next six to 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   It is likely that this new venture will be approaching potential
sources of investment capital later this year, these people said.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who will not be joining Meriwether's faithful band
will be David Mullins Jr., who quit as vice chairman of the Federal
Reserve to become a partner in Long-Term Capital. Two other jewels
in Meriwether's crown, the Nobel laureate economists Myron Scholes
and Robert Merton, have already left the fund.

IN CHICAGO, BLACK POLICE AND VICTIMS, DEFY PATTERN OF RACISM
CHARGES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Chicago police superintendent, responding to
charges of racism in the department after the fatal shootings of
two unarmed blacks here during traffic stops, said that officers
had violated department policy and announced that video cameras
would be placed in patrol cars.
</P>
<P>
   The superintendent, Terry Hillard, spoke on Thursday when he was
summoned to appear before a committee of the City Council after
protests this week near police headquarters denouncing racism and
``police brutality.''
</P>
<P>
   But the cases do not fit a familiar racial pattern: the officers
who fired the shots were black.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings have caused an uproar on the City Council,
especially among black politicians who say a climate of racism can
even taint the judgment of black police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Hillard, who is black and has criticized how the police handled
the cases _ five officers have been notified that they will face
charges of violating police rules _ said the installation of video
cameras was ``not only for the safety of the citizens, but for the
police officers, to dispel some of the rumors that the entire
Chicago Police Department is corrupt, abusive and using excessive
force day in and day out.''
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing before a City Council committee, Hillard said
that a preliminary investigation showed that the death of LaTanya
Haggerty, 26, on June 4, happened after four officers ignored an
order to stop pursuing a car that had fled a traffic stop. Ms.
Haggerty was a passenger in the car and was shot after an officer
mistook her cellular phone for a gun, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   In the second incident, a Northwestern University football
player, Robert Russ, 22, was shot on June 5 after the police say he
grabbed an officer's gun, which had been pointed inside his car
after the police knocked the glass out of his car window following
a car chase. Hillard said the officer had acted improperly by using
a lug wrench to knock out a window in Russ' car.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours after the hearing, Hillard said he had asked
prosecutors to investigate a third case, the death of a man in a
struggle with police officers. The man, Gregory Ryan, 31, who was
suspected of drug dealing, died on Monday night after he fell to a
sidewalk on the city's West Side. The Cook County Coroner's Office
ruled the death a homicide Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Hillard has bristled at suggestions of racism in the cases,
noting that the Police Department has rules against stopping
drivers simply because they are black, a practice sometimes called
``racial profiling.'' But he has acknowledged that the department
has a credibility gap with many of the city's black residents.
</P>
<P>
   The city's police union has defended the officers in the cases,
saying it is unfair to second-guess the actions of officers who
know the dangers of the streets and realize that a delay of a
second can mean being killed.
</P>
<P>
   But Ronald Hampton, the executive director of the National Black
Police Association in Washington, said it was impossible to ignore
the harsher treatment meted out to blacks, even by black police
officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception that gets drummed into everybody's head is that
everyone in a black community is dangerous,'' said Hampton, a
retired Washington police officer. ``Even people of color start
believing the myths.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said it was naive for cities to believe that racial
diversity alone would bring fair treatment to blacks, especially
those in poorer neighborhoods. ``If you're a black police officer
who wants to be successful, who wants to get ahead,'' he said,
``you're going to take on the thinking of the institution'' and act
especially tough with people in black neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Hampton added, many blacks distrust black
police officers. ``To black people, policing in America goes back
to slavery,'' he said. ``And so people tend to be skeptical of a
young person who joins the police force. They'll say, `He's part of
the system now.'''
</P>
<P>
   Blacks account for about 25 percent of the officers on the
Chicago Police Department. Blacks make up nearly 40 percent of the
city's population.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard M. Daley, who in 1998 appointed Hillard to lead
the Police Department, has said the Russ and Haggerty cases have
``chipped'' the relationship between the police and people in the
neighborhoods. Daley said the families of the people killed by the
officers deserve ``a full explanation,'' and he said they would get
it ``very shortly.''

 &HT;    Thrashers net a goalie
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ Thrashers general manager Don Waddell has
secured one of the goalies most people thought he would take in
next week's expansion draft _ only he didn't wait for the expansion
draft.
</P>
<P>
   In the first of what figures to be a series of complex trades in
the next week, the Thrashers Friday acquired Ottawa goalie Damian
Rhodes for future considerations. Rhodes, who would have been a
free agent, immediately signed a four-year contract believed to be
worth approximately $9 million, although it has not yet been filed
with the NHL Players Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's one of the guys we've watched a lot,'' Waddell said. ``He
doesn't panic, and as an expansion team you can assume he'll see a
lot of shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Rhodes is the Thrashers' first player and probably will be their
starting goaltender next season, pending the outcome of the
expansion draft. He shared starting duties on the Senators last
season with Ron Tugnutt and posted a record of 22-13-7 with a 2.44
goals against average and a .905 saves percentage.
</P>
<P>
   But Rhodes said he grew weary of coach Jacques Martin's goalie
rotation, in which each started two games in a surprising
first-round playoff sweep by Buffalo. He allowed six goals on 65
shots (.908) in his two playoff losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't getting the amount of playing time I wanted in
Ottawa, but I didn't want to say anything and rock the boat,''
Rhodes said. ``This year neither one of us could get in a groove.''
</P>
<P>
   On going from a team that finished with the third-best record in
the regular season (44-23-15) to an expansion club, Rhodes said,
``That's the hardest part about it. But I'll get more work in. I
was only seeing about 15 or 20 shots a game in Ottawa.''
</P>
<P>
   By trading for Rhodes rather than drafting him next week, the
Thrashers still can select the maximum five goalies in the
expansion draft next Friday. In return, Atlanta agreed to select an
Ottawa player in the draft from a list provided by the Senators.
The Senators could not afford to re-sign Rhodes, who earned $1.6
million this season, but wanted something in return. They were
concerned that the Thrashers might not want to use an expansion
pick on Rhodes because he was unsigned.
</P>
<P>
   The Thrashers can draft as many as six free agents, but only one
can be a goalie. If they take a free agent but fail to sign him,
they receive a compensatory pick in next year's amateur draft.
</P>
<P>
   Trading for Rhodes leaves Waddell with more options. Waddell
first contacted then-Ottawa general manager Rick Dudley on June 2
about a possible deal. But talks were put on hold when Dudley left
for Tampa Bay. Waddell resumed conversations with new Senators
general manager Marshall Johnston earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a great opportunity for us,'' Waddell said. ``We've
talked all year about building around goaltending and we feel
comfortable that we'll go into our first season with one of the top
goaltenders in the league.''

SPORTS COLUMN: WOMEN'S SOCCER TRYING TO CRACK A GRANITE WALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The great Pele was surrounded by children and besieged by
adults. For a moment he was the acrobatic Cosmos' star at midfield,
surrounded, seemingly trapped. As a player he would simply spin.
Accelerate, explode and score. On this bright afternoon, there was
no escape _ everywhere Pele turned there were love and
reminiscences.
</P>
<P>
   This was Friday afternoon, on the lawn of the U.N. building, on
the eve of the Women's World Cup soccer tournament. U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and FIFA President Joseph (Sepp)
Blatter announced a partnership to promote world peace. After the
announcement, Pele was mobbed, by children not even born when he
had scored his final goal and by parents who have vivid memories of
each electric moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stopped playing soccer so many years ago, but the kids,
generation after generation, still love me,'' Pele said. ``It's a
privilege granted by the gods.''
</P>
<P>
   Soccer in the United States has made major strides between
Pele's last goal and his appearance Friday, when the United Nations
announced a partnership between the U.N. and FIFA. There is a
significant difference in the atmosphere surrounding soccer. During
the 1970s and '80s, Pele was the battering ram for men's soccer as
the sport tried to take a share of a market dominated by American
football, baseball and basketball. Soccer couldn't crack that
granite wall.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, women's soccer has achieved a level of success the men
never dreamed of. Behold the miracle: Giants Stadium sold out
Saturday as the women's tournament begins. The United States and
Denmark will play in the opening match, a game that is critical not
merely for want of a championship, but for the continued growth of
women's soccer in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The women desperately need a league, and they have earned that
right with their performance. Female basketball players have a
league of their own _ the Women's National Basketball Association _
which largely piggybacks off the NBA. The jury is still out,
however, on whether there is enough interest to sustain that league
_ the American Basketball League, another women's professional
league, folded in December. The level of athleticism in women's
basketball games has hit a striking new gear. But, whether it's
right or wrong, the women's game _ based largely on fundamentals
and finesse _ still suffers by comparison to the men's game, a more
explosive game played largely above the rim.
</P>
<P>
   Women's soccer in the United States can stand on its own. In
fact, the women have done far better in international competition
than the American men. This is in large part because of the battle
for men's bodies among football, baseball and basketball. Those
sports have an extensive conveyor-belt system that cultivates and
delivers athletes to major league sports through an intricate
network. Women are largely excluded from these football and
baseball tributaries. The chauvinism of football and baseball has
backed those sports into a corner. How much longer will women
support what they can't participate in?
</P>
<P>
   Increasing numbers of women are flowing into basketball and
soccer, creating an expanding talent base and a widening spectator
base as well. ``Four years ago I predicted that the future of
football will be women,'' Blatter said. ``I said that in 10 years
we will have as many girls playing the game as boys.''
</P>
<P>
   As Pele signed autographs in the middle of a throng of bodies,
Nene, the star of the women's Brazilian national team, waited on
the periphery of the crowd for her own autograph. Pele was her
hero, too. She was a little girl when he signed his first
professional contract at age 17. There were no female role models;
female participation was discouraged. ``He motivated me, at a young
age, to train,'' Nene said. ``I became one of the few players that
participated in my first World Cup at 17. Once I accomplished that
I kept going and going. Now I am on my third World Cup. ``
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Annan called soccer the only true global sport. In fact
basketball has become a global sport as well, and both sports are
beginning to draw talent from the same sources: suburban areas and
increasingly the inner cities. The subsequent battle for bodies
between women's basketball and women's soccer will be fascinating
to observe, with each sport becoming richer for the battle.
</P>
<P>
   There is mighty symbolism in Giants Stadium this evening,
American football being shoved aside for a day by real football.
``This is the reality,'' Pele said. ``This is not the future _ this
is reality today. In the United States, where people supposedly
don't play soccer but play football, you see Giants Stadium sold
out for a women's tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soccer in the United States, between the kids and the women,
is one more pastime. That's a reality.'' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: WINDOW FOR WOODS SEEMS WIDE ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ His tee shot, as he likes to say, had ``flamed
out'' to the right into the tall pines on the Pinehurst No. 2
course's 485-yard par-4 eighth hole, but when Tiger Woods got to
his ball, he knew he had a shot off the pine straw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a little window; I could fit a ball through there pretty
easily,'' he said. ``It was only about 3 feet, but it was plenty
wide from the distance I had to work with. I just tried to hit a
nice, drawing 8-iron. I had 146 yards to the right bowl in the
green. I hit it pin-high to the bowl, two-putted and walked out of
there very happy.''
</P>
<P>
   On the 610-yard 10th hole, Woods' 2-iron second shot stopped in
a swale short of the green, some 50 feet from the pin. His chip
with a 3-wood rolled up the slope and across the green to within 8
inches. Birdie.
</P>
<P>
   With those two shots helping to preserve his one-over-par 71
Friday, 23-year-old Tiger Woods was at 139 in this United States
Open _ his lowest 36-hole score in his five Open appearances. His
best previous score halfway through an Open was 141, at
Congressional two years ago, when he finished at 289 and tied for
19th. At Olympic last year, he shot 290, tied for 18th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased just to be under par,'' he said. ``In the
Open, you have to hang in there. You have to keep grinding it out
and making the pars, but the guys will come back.''
</P>
<P>
   The guys weren't that far away. David Duval, Phil Mickelson and
Payne Stewart shared the lead, only two strokes ahead of Woods. In
Saturday's third round, Woods will be playing with Mickelson in the
next-to-last twosome, ahead of Stewart and Duval.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Open and PGA Tour rules, Stewart, the first to
finish at 139, was paired with Duval instead of Mickelson, because
Duval was listed first in Group 33 in Friday's starting times,
ahead of Carlos Franco and Mickelson.
</P>
<P>
   Theatrically, a Duval-Woods pairing would have provided a rare
mano a mano between No. 1 (Duval) and No. 2 (Woods) in the world
ranking, with the third-round Open lead up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   But depending on their scores Saturday, a Woods-Duval pairing
could develop for Sunday's final round, as each player pursues his
first United States Open title.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the leaders, Woods has been the hottest golfer lately,
arriving here as a co-favorite with Duval after having won his
previous two tournaments _the Deutsche Bank SAP Open in Germany and
the Memorial at Muirfield Village outside Columbus, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ``My thought process is still the same as it's been in the Open,
trying to make pars, just that my execution is a lot better,'' he
said. ``I didn't have the shots that I did in my other Opens. Even
last year at Olympic, I did not have the shots I have now.''
</P>
<P>
   On the PGA Tour this year, he has already won nearly $1.9
million, winning the Buick Invitational and the Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a lot better than I was in other years,'' he said. ``My
game is better. My swing is better. I'm stronger than I've ever
been. Different things have contributed to my good play, but more
important, I think it's the revamping of my swing that really feels
good. I wasn't happy with '97 because I was so inconsistent.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Woods earned $1.8 million on the PGA Tour last year, he
won only once, at the Bell South Classic in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was frustrating,'' he said. ``I wasn't that far
away. I was finishing in top 10's, but I wasn't getting the W's
because my swing wasn't as good as it is now.''
</P>
<P>
   On the range before Friday's round, Woods hit balls as Butch
Harmon, his swing guru, watched.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got back in good position again, then went out there and hit
the same way as I did on the range,'' Woods said. ``To be able to
carry what you worked out on the range out on the golf course, that
definitely builds confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   And when Tiger Woods was asked if he were looking at the leader
boards, he smiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you,'' he said, ``I don't really care what
they're doing because I can't afford to. I need to play my own game
and get myself into contention and keep executing my shots. It's
not where it's a showdown between two or three players right now.
You can focus on that when you have two or three holes left on
Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   As if he had no doubt that he'll be there on Sunday.

06-18 -- The bell tower of the San Agustin Church was shredded
Tuesday during the 6.7 earthquake that struck the area. The church,
whose original structure dates back to the late 1500's, may fare
better than many Puebla residents initially thought. Rubble from a
collapsed bell tower is primarily material that was added as late
as the 19th century, and much of the original tower survived.

 &HT;    Sabres don't want view of Cup tonight
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ In the final minutes of a game in Dallas the
other night, a faux Stanley Cup constructed of cardboard and
aluminum foil was tossed from the stands into the Buffalo Sabres'
bench.
</P>
<P>
   If you thought the Sabres, given their dire situation, did not
find the faux Cup amusing, imagine what their reaction will be if
they see the real thing tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Buffalo nor Dallas has ever won a Stanley Cup. But the
Stars, who lead the series 3-2, can celebrate with a victory on the
Sabres' home ice tonight at Marine Midland Arena. It would be a
painful flashback for the Sabres, who in 1975 saw Philadelphia
close out its second Cup in the old Buffalo Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want that to happen in our building,'' said Sabres
coach Lindy Ruff. ``We'll do everything possible to force a Game 7
(in Dallas Tuesday). I truly believe you'll see our best game of
the series. We'll compete to the bitter end. It will be a game that
will sum up our community. We'll outwork them and outhit them and
do everything possible to win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Appropriate that Ruff should invoke the community in his
comments. If the Sabres lose, the only Buffalo residents who might
feel some relief are current and former Bills, who lost four Super
Bowls and at least would have some company. Two of those losses
came to Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what we've been waiting for all year,'' said Stars
center Mike Modano, an original draft pick of the Minnesota North
Stars, who moved to Dallas. ``We knew it would take 16 wins in the
playoffs and we've got 15. The anticipation of waiting for the game
is getting overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   Said veteran Guy Carbonneau, who played on two Stanley Cup teams
in Montreal, ``We played this year for the home ice advantage. But
we don't want to have to go to the seventh game to use it.''
</P>
<P>
   If they continue to get the kind of defense and goaltending from
Ed Belfour that they have, a win will come. The Sabres scored three
goals in their Game 1 victory but have only five in the four games
since. Buffalo also must play without defenseman Rhett Warrener,
who suffered a broken ankle in Game 5.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres, meanwhile, sparked another war or words by calling
the Stars a dirty team. Center Michael Peca said, ``They have the
dirtiest team we've ever faced. I guess part of the thing about
experience is they know how to hide all their two-handed slashes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruff said, ``They're a vicious team with their sticks. Like
(assistant coach) Mike Ramsey said, `On offense they use their soft
sticks and on defense they swing by the bench and pick up their
hatchets.'''
</P>
<P>
   Carbonneau's response: ``We expect to win. If they want to call
us cheap-shot players, let them. But we're going to do everything
we can to win games. We don't try to hurt anybody. But we have one
goal in mind: to win the Stanley Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock accused Ruff of intentionally sending Warrener
(6-foot-1) to go after Dallas' Derian Hatcher (6-3) in the final
seconds. The two wrestled to the ice, and Warrener broke his ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Said Ruff, ``Be honest. If we wanted to go after somebody, are
we gonna go after Hatcher? We'll go after Carbonneau or Modano or
(Joe) Nieuwendyk. We're not going to send David after Goliath.''

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, June 18 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: Y2K
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday approved, 62-37, a bill that would
restrict punitive damages and class action suits against businesses
if problems arise with computers and other systems that are not
fully Year 2000 compliant. The bill would also require consumers to
wait 90 days before they could file lawsuits in such cases.
Supporters said high technology companies need protection from such
lawsuits. Opponents said the bill would leave consumers without any
recourse to recoup financial losses caused by the Y2K bug. A
``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: AIRPORTS
</P>
<P>
   The House on Tuesday approved, 316-110, legislation providing
$57 billion for aviation safety and improvements. The bill would
significantly increase spending for airport construction and air
traffic control facilities over the next five years. Supporters
said the funding will provide for much-needed improvements to
airport facilities. Opponents said the bill is too expensive and
endangers other spending programs and prospects for a tax cut. A
``yes'' vote favors the bill.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: PROSECUTE
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday passed, 249-181, an amendment to a larger
juvenile justice bill that imposes stricter penalties on juveniles
that commit violent crimes. Under the bill, juveniles as young as
14 could be tried as adults, and anyone caught with a gun with the
intent to bring it to school could face a maximum penalty of up to
five years incarceration. Supporters said the measures were
necessary to prevent violent crimes, such as the deadly school
shooting in Colorado. Opponents said the bill was too strict and
would undermine the possible rehabilitation of juvenile offenders.
A ``yes'' vote supports the measure.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: MEDIA
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday rejected, 146-282, an amendment to a
larger juvenile justice bill that would have made it illegal to
distribute or sell sexually explicit or violent materials to
juveniles. Supporters said the measure was necessary to restrict
juvenile access to materials that may contribute to increased
violent behavior. Opponents said the measure violated the free
speech clause of the Constitution. A ``yes'' vote supported the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   4) BILL NUMBER: COMMAND
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 248-180, an amendment to a
larger juvenile justice bill that gives states the power to post
The Ten Commandments inside school and court buildings. Supporters
said the measure would help bring values back into both arenas and
hopefully would deter future killing sprees like the one in
Colorado. Opponents said the measure was a violation of the
separation of church and state. A ``yes'' vote supports the bill.
</P>
<P>
   5) BILL NUMBER: JUSTICE
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 287-139, a juvenile justice bill
that gives $1.5 billion to state and local governments to fight
juvenile crime and to establish prevention programs. Supporters
said that the measure was a tough, yet family-oriented, response to
the calls for stricter punishment for juvenile offenses in the wake
of the deadly school shooting in Colorado. Opponents said the bill
did not properly address the problems facing juveniles today. A
``yes'' vote supports the bill.

<P>
   6) BILL NUMBER: INSTANT
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday approved, 218-211, a measure that would
limit background checks at gun shows to 24 hours. The measure also
cuts back the number of gun shows that are subject to federal
investigation checks. Supporters said it was important to limit the
background checks because some gun shows only last a few days and
that the measure was sufficient in making sure that convicted
felons do not have access to guns. Opponents said the bill made
buying guns easier and would do nothing to prevent convicts from
getting guns. A ``yes'' vote supports the bill.
</P>
<P>
   7) BILL NUMBER: BACKGROUND
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday rejected, 193-235, a measure that would
have provided three business days for criminal background checks at
gun shows. Supporters said the bill was an effective way to keep
firearms away from criminals, people with mental illnesses and
children. Opponents said the bill was too broad and could
potentially put gun shows out of business. A ``yes'' vote supports
the measure.

 By RICHARD KORMAN    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAWRENCEVILLE, N.J. _ You might call it Russo's revenge.
</P>
<P>
   The Russo in question, Paul J., felt ignored by the $100 billion
bank where his family home-improvement business keeps its accounts.
Despite a hefty checking balance, he was often asked to produce two
forms of identification at the teller window. ``Not one person
knows my name,'' he complained.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last year, Russo was invited to help start a new bank in
this suburb near Princeton, a bank that would be based on friendly
service, not nationwide heft. Two local men _ a young banker and an
insurance executive _ were looking for investors, and Russo bought
in.
</P>
<P>
   There are hundreds of small-business people across the country
who are taking similar stands. Sweeping bank consolidation has left
many states, particularly New Jersey, California and Florida, with
a landscape of regional bank giants and tiny credit unions, and
little in between.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing opportunity in a long economic boom, organizers like
those who approached Russo have sought or won charters for 19 new
community banks in New Jersey since 1996. Nationally, there were
216 new bank charters granted in 1998, compared with 53 in 1994;
though no one keeps an exact count, bank experts presume that many
of these new institutions are community banks.
</P>
<P>
   The rallying cry for a lot of the new ventures is a Howard
Beale-like ``I'm not going to take this anymore,'' but banking is
no field for amateur enthusiasts with good Rotary Club connections.
Chartering a new bank is costly and time-consuming, requiring the
mobilization of market and technical expertise and the ability to
satisfy demanding regulators.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest part nowadays is raising capital. Small bank stocks
are out of favor, some of the last places many people would invest.
As a result, asking local merchants and neighbors to open their
wallets may not yield enough money, forcing organizers to turn to
wealthy, well-connected financial professionals who may be prone to
second-guessing a bank president at every bump in the road.
</P>
<P>
   Village Bank, the start-up that attracted Russo, is being
chartered in the name of customer service. But to reward its
investors and to survive, some analysts say, it will have to plunge
into the currents of deregulated financial services and swim
rapidly to assets of $75 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   Even experienced bankers can find the going tough.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth J. Stephon, 40, hatched the idea for Village Bank and
helped convince Russo and others to invest their reputations, as
board members, as well as their money. Now, as the bank rides the
uncertainties of an initial public stock offering, Stephon must
work against a loudly ticking clock.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way to know how close Village Bank's offering has
come to its goal so far _ Securities and Exchange Commission rules
prohibit the bank from saying. But after easily attracting $948,000
of seed capital, outfitting two small, well-situated offices and
hiring core staff, Village Bank failed to meet a self-imposed
eight-week deadline, on March 26, to raise the balance of the $5
million minimum capital required to open.
</P>
<P>
   As the bank's founders reach further into their webs of
neighbors, friends and relatives, the offering can seem more like a
charitable fund-raiser than a small-cap share placement.
</P>
<P>
   Rents, salaries and other costs, meanwhile, are eating through
the seed capital at a rate of more than $50,000 a month. According
to the bank's latest filing with the SEC, the initial $948,000 will
be exhausted by the end of July.
</P>
<P>
   (Dick Wines, a partner in Capital Consultants of Princeton, who
is following Village Bank, says that if the organizers run out of
cash, they can go to the individual investors for more money or ask
some of the people who have bought shares to designate their
investment as seed money.
</P>
<P>
   Legally, the bank has until Dec. 7 to complete its offering.
Only then, if the necessary $5 million has not been raised, would
Village Bank die aborning, with the subscribers to the stock
offering getting their money back and the original seed-capital
investors eating the losses.
</P>
<P>
   Village Bank plans to offer low-fee checking, at least at the
outset, and ready access to the bank president. Many community
banks that have been chartered in the last few years have thrived
in just that way, by beating the big banks on price and service.
</P>
<P>
   But according to some bankers, the giants are responding more
quickly to competitive pressure. In New Jersey, for example, Summit
Bank, one of the state's largest, recently rolled back its minimum
balance for free checking from $1,000 to $99. Summit said it simply
wanted to provide more competitive products and accelerate deposit
growth. ``We consider ourselves 73 community banks that form
Summit,'' said Robert G. Cox, the bank's president.
</P>
<P>
   Another giant, First Union of Charlotte, N.C., which acquired a
big branch network in New Jersey when it bought First Fidelity in
1996, says it has introduced several programs geared toward small
business _ and a menu of ways for customers to invest small
deposits or balances.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts say public disgust with poor service and high fees
alone are not enough to spur the creation of a new community bank.

   Steven A. Seelig, a researcher with the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp. who has studied bank start-ups, said: ``Our results
show it's not just because Nationsbank or another comes in. You
have to have enough of a customer base to really make money at
it.'' That, and not mergers, is spawning the new banks, he added.
</P>

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Many of New Jersey's new banks are being chartered in its most
affluent neighborhoods, like the areas of Mercer County around
Princeton where Village Bank hopes to do business.
</P>
<P>
   Stephon does not see doing well and doing good as mutually
exclusive. ``There are economic motives in everything, except maybe
the Red Cross,'' he said. ``But we're not a group of capitalists
who said, `Where can we best deploy our funds?' We said, `There's
an absolute need for community services.' Economic opportunity is a
marvelous byproduct, not the impetus.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephon and Village Bank's chairman, William C. Hart, 65, have
been friends for years. Hart, currently chief executive of Mercer
Mutual Insurance, once ran Centennial Savings and Loan in
Pennington, N.J., where Stephon was a part-time management trainee.
Stephon later became chief executive of Cloverbank, a small, old
savings and loan association in Pennsauken, 40 miles from
Lawrenceville, where Hart served on the board. Both men cut their
ties to Cloverbank last year.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, 1998 was one of the best years in memory for
savings banks, with profits spiking on a steady diet of fees and a
healthy 1.01 percent return on assets, according to the FDIC. But
Stephon hungered for a more entrepreneurial banking style than
Cloverbank's conservative culture would allow. So for months, he
and Hart chewed over the idea of a new bank.
</P>
<P>
   The first choice they faced was what kind of bank charter to
seek. Mercer County was not underserved _ there are 39 bank
branches within four miles of Village Bank's headquarters. But most
of those are commercial banks or credit unions; locally owned
savings and loans have become an endangered species. A savings and
loan charter held another attraction: Stephon knew the regulatory
personnel at the Office of Thrift Supervision and other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   So Village Bank is going the savings and loan route and will
focus its lending on mortgages and other real estate-backed loans.
</P>
<P>
   But don't be fooled by the apparent narrowness of the savings
and loan's mission. Village Bank's entrepreneurial intent is
embodied in its corporate form, a holding company called the
Village Financial Corp. with the bank as its only operating unit.
That structure allows the parent to offer a full range of financial
services, or to sell mutual funds and securities through
affiliates. The directors can sell Village Financial to a
nonbanking business, greatly widening the pool of possible
acquirers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To sign the needed investors and directors, Stephon and Hart got
busy networking in early 1998. They assembled a board, including a
local investment adviser, William V.R. Fogler; two of Fogler's
clients, Paul Russo and Jonathan R. Sachs, a gastroenterologist;
and George M. Taber, president of a regional magazine, Business
News New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   While that core group was forming, Hart got in touch with Fred
D. Price, a partner at a New York firm of banking industry
underwriters and consultants, Sandler, O'Neill &AMP; Partners. Price
lives in Cranbury, a 20-minute drive from Lawrenceville; Sandler,
O'Neill had done some consulting for Hart's firm, Mercer Mutual.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with Hart and Stephon, Price personally put in
$200,000, making him Village Bank's biggest investor.
</P>
<P>
   Price's involvement strikes some bank executives as a danger
signal. ``I wouldn't want to be CEO with him on board,'' said
Anthony S. Abbate, chief executive of Interchange Bank, a
successful community bank in Saddle Brook, N.J. ``People put money
up, but then they get antsy,'' he said, referring to investors like
Price. ``If you don't leverage up the capital, and guys are sitting
there who made investments and are not happy, you will see the CEO
turn over two or three times. It's not at all uncommon.''
</P>
<P>
   Other community bank executives said an investor like Price
might push Village Bank to engage in sophisticated financial
engineering that it may be ill-equipped to handle. Price has been
quoted in trade publications explaining the advantages of using
derivatives to limit banks' interest rate risk. Such instruments,
handled improperly, have been at the heart of some notable
financial disasters across the country.
</P>
<P>
   Price said any worries about his role at Village Bank stemmed
from misunderstandings. First, he said, derivatives have no
relevance for Village Bank because start-ups rarely have enough
assets with interest rate risk to justify hedging with derivatives.
(The Office of Thrift Supervision says that only a handful of
savings banks use derivatives, and they are all large banks.)
</P>
<P>
   Price also said he had invested in Village Bank because he
believes in community banking, not because he wants to be a
backseat driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no intention to be on the board, and did not make this
investment to have any controlling or undue influence,'' he said;
rather, he wanted an investment on which ``my kids someday down the
road enjoy the return.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephon said he doesn't know Price well, but is pleased that
``one of the best banking minds in the country'' has a large vested
interest in the success of Village Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel privileged that he is involved,'' Stephon added. &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   In the search for suitable premises, Village Bank got lucky.
Another bank was pulling out of a 3,952-square-foot branch on
Quakerbridge Road, convenient to the Quakerbridge Mall. Village
Bank took over the lease at an initial rent of $4,000 a month. A
counter with six teller stations was in place, and Village Bank
bought the furniture and vault from the departing tenant for
$35,000. Space for a second, limited-hours office was rented next
to a retirement housing complex in Pennington, near the homes of
several board members.
</P>
<P>
   The time had come to raise the rest of the $5 million minimum
capital. The board hired Ryan, Beck &AMP; Co. to administer the
offering, which started last Feb. 3. The bank priced the shares at
$10 each with a $1,000 minimum, intending to issue 425,000 to 1.2
million shares, depending on demand. As chief executive, Stephon
will be one of the bigger shareholders if he exercises all of the
10,000 stock options granted under his contract.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, other new community banks in New Jersey raised
capital with relative ease. After 14 organizers kicked in $1.8
million to seed Red Oak Bank in Morristown, new subscribers bought
shares worth $9.6 million within 10 weeks. Red Oak's chief
executive, Dale G. Potter, had piloted to success another community
bank in New Jersey, Growth Bank, in Harding Township; it has since
been absorbed by Hudson United Bank, a midsize bank in Union City.
</P>
<P>
   Hopewell Valley Community Bank, a close neighbor to Village
Bank, failed to meet the preliminary termination date for its
public share offering, Oct. 30, but only by a single day. Its total
equity capital has since risen to $7.8 million from $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   Village Bank's offering is moving much more slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of holding a large community meeting _ a common
shareholder recruiting tactic _ Village Bank chose smaller,
roadshow-style meetings and advertised aggressively. It even
splurged on an ad in The Wall Street Journal, on the theory that
sophisticated investors might not see ads in local papers.
</P>
<P>
   The sales drive drew some undesired attention. When the offering
remained incomplete after the self-imposed March 26 deadline
passed, local news accounts raised questions whether Stephon had a
high-enough local profile to make the bank fly. Federal regulations
have prevented Stephon from saying publicly exactly how well the
offering is going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Village Bank is getting a lot of press, and I think that's
good news and bad news,'' said Wines of Capital Consultants of
Princeton. The March deadline was too optimistic, but it ``got
blown out of proportion,'' he said. Even so, the bank's
preoccupation has remained raising capital, in small meetings like
one held on April 14. Such meetings, Stephon said, communicate the
intimacy the bank hopes to embody.
</P>
<P>
   As the sun set, about 15 people gathered in the
living-room-sized employee cafeteria of the Mercer Mutual Life
Insurance building in Pennington. Outside, commuters clogged the
two-lane roads that embroider fallow pastures and strip-mall
parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   Hart introduced Stephon, who made his presentation and
introduced each director. They stood like sentries around the
room's perimeter, jacket buttons resolutely fastened. During the
evening, each offered a personal horror story of what big bad banks
do.
</P>
<P>
   Sachs said his bank had done nothing to help his practice with
its annual year-end cash flow crunch. Fogler, the investment
adviser, was more scalding, saying he ``is totally disgusted'' with
the treatment from his bank _ including taking three months to fix
a minor problem with his checking account.
</P>
<P>
   Taber, the publisher, said the idea of getting personal service
from a bank based in Charlotte (a reference to First Union) was a
contradiction in terms.
</P>
<P>
   Village Bank, Stephon pledged, will never lose sight of its
customers. ``You will be able to reach me 24 hours a day, seven
days a week,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Though the attendance was light, spirits were high. Most of the
prospects, it turned out, knew someone connected to Village Bank.
One was the chairman's sister; another had a daughter about to
start work at the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Alfred Christie, a New Jersey doctor, said he had known Bill
Hart for more than 30 years. Christie remembered that his uncle had
opened a $100 account for him at the long-departed Trenton Banking
Co. on May 6, 1931, the day he was born, and he said he planned to
subscribe to some Village Bank shares.
</P>
<P>
   Two months after the meeting, though, Christie hadn't sent in
his check. The bank is a great idea, he said, but ``I'm worried
about whether they are going to get the money.'' His accountant, he
added, had discouraged the investment, saying it was imprudent for
a man his age.
</P>
<P>
   The longer the offering remains open, the harder it is to
sustain an appearance of momentum.
</P>
<P>
   Russo wonders at investors' reluctance. ``If people are willing
to put money in an Internet stock with no earnings, then they ought
to be willing to invest in Village Bank,'' he said. ``They'll be
able to sleep at night.''

PATAKI CLOSES LOOPHOLE ON PURCHASES OF FIREARMS AT GUN SHOWS ON
STATE PROPERTY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki said Friday that he would
require a background check for anyone who buys a firearm at a gun
show held on state property.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's comments came after the House of Representatives
narrowly passed a measure to regulate the sales of weapons at gun
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current federal laws, collectors and hobbyists who
sell firearms at gun shows are not required to conduct criminal
background checks on buyers, but licensed dealers who sell guns at
the shows are required to conduct the checks.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said his order ``closes the loophole that exists under
federal law.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's aides said he plans to submit a bill to the State
Legislature if the efforts to regulate the sale of weapons at gun
shows failed in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   His aides did not elaborate on those plans, and it was unclear
how such a move would be received in the Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's comments came in response to questions by reporters
over whether he would require background checks during a gun show
scheduled for this weekend at the Empire State Plaza, a state-owned
complex near the Capitol. The governor's aides said there are only
a handful of gun shows held on state property each year.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend's show, sponsored by a group called the New York
State Arms Collectors, is expected to draw several thousand people
over two days. Roughly 150 gun dealers have registered to attend
the event, according to state officials.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki has been under intense pressure by gun-control groups and
lobbyists to cancel the show. But he has refused to do so, saying
that the state had entered into a contract with the organizer.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, Pataki announced that he had used his executive
authority to require collectors and hobbyists selling weapons at
the show to conduct background checks of buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to direct that all state agencies be required, if
they are going to permit these kind of activities, that there are
full and complete background checks,'' he said in response to
questions from reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is something that I have the power to do on state
property,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the governor's order, all firearm buyers at gun shows on
state property must undergo a criminal background check through a
national registry known as the National Instant Criminal Background
System. The background checks are often instantaneous, meaning
people can buy the weapons immediately if they do not have a
criminal history that would prevent them from making such a
purchase.
</P>
<P>
   But Pataki's order would require a waiting period of up to three
days if, for whatever reason, a background check on a buyer could
not be completed immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said his order would not apply to police officers and
licensed gun dealers. He said State Police officers would be posted
at the gun show in Albany to insure his order is enforced.

 &HT;    All bets are on in interstate NBA rivalry
 &HT;    By Christian Davenport
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm fired the first salvo from
his Washington office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eat our dust, city boy,'' he said to his New York counterpart,
Sen. Charles Schumer. ``And, hey, what the heck is a Knick
anyhow?''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer fired back as quickly as a Texas outlaw: ``Even Davy
Crockett couldn't help the Spurs pull this one off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of the National Basketball Association
championship series, which pits the New York Knicks against the San
Antonio Spurs, harsh words and wagers have been flying between the
Empire State and the Lone Star State.
</P>
<P>
   If the Spurs win, Democrat Schumer has vowed to send Republican
Gramm smoked salmon, bagels and cannolis from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the heck is a cannoli?'' Gramm said. ``I guess I'll be
finding out soon.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Knicks win, Gramm has to send Schumer a case of wine from
Lubbock's Llano Estacado Winery and Mars candies from Waco.
</P>
<P>
   They are not the only state leaders laying it on the line.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio Mayor Howard Peak wagered a case of Lone Star beer,
tamales and chips and salsa against New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's Brooklyn Beer, Nathan's hot dogs and cheesecake from
Junior's restaurant in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   They added a touch of humiliation to whoever loses the bet: The
loser has to wear the opponent's baseball cap in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to seeing him wear that hat,'' Peak said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush is betting New York Gov. George Pataki
a pair of cowboy boots _ with spurs, of course. Pataki said he'll
send Bush sandwiches from Ben's Best Deli and a dozen bagels.

INTERNET MUSIC TAKES A FIRST STEP INTO THE MAINSTREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (kd) 
By LISA NAPOLI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Delivering music over the Internet, long depicted by record
labels as the illegal pastime of college students and pirates, won
an important measure of legitimacy this week when ASCAP, the
American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers, announced a
licensing agreement with MP3.com, one of the leading music Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, announced on Wednesday, songwriters whose
work is offered on MP3.com and who agree to pay ASCAP a $10
membership fee will receive royalty payments based on how often
their music is downloaded or purchased as a compact disk.
</P>
<P>
   The license will also allow MP3.com to offer downloads of music
from artists already represented by ASCAP online, though the
details of this arrangement have not been worked out, said Marc
Morgenstern, ASCAP's senior vice president for strategic planning
and new media.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement between ASCAP, the world's largest performing
rights organization, and MP3.com, a two-year-old online distributor
of digital music, represents a breakthrough truce between the
industry's old guard and the young turks of the Internet who want
to change the rules of music sales and distribution. Just as the
major record companies have viewed online music with alarm,
MP3.com's founder, Michael Robertson, has long distanced himself
from the traditional business.
</P>
<P>
   MP3, the popular, easy-to-copy computer file format for which
the site is named, has become a symbol of the turmoil that exists
within the music industry as it wrestles with alternative
distribution models.
</P>
<P>
   The MP3.com site is a sort of combination digital jukebox and
digital radio station. It allows unknown musicians from around the
world to circumvent traditional record companies and find an
audience for their work by making it available for listening or
purchase online. Music fans can download songs for no charge or, if
they choose, buy a compact disk.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for the exposure, artists split the revenue
generated by sales of their recordings with MP3.com. The site also
makes money by selling advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at MP3.com declined to comment on the licensing deal
on Thursday, citing the ``quiet period'' following the initial
public offering of its stock last month. ASCAP's Morgenstern called
the licensing deal ``a creative approach to something that ASCAP
and MP3.com have in common, which is, how do you find, promote and
develop musical talent?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It just goes to show that there is a major site that
recognizes the value of copyright,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   While promoters of the MP3 format have celebrated its outlaw
image, ASCAP has already sold about 1,000 performance rights
licenses to Web sites, most of which offer other formats. The
Digital Millennium Copyright Act, signed into law last year, makes
it illegal to offer copyrighted material online without such a
license.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fees for the online licenses range from $250 for home-grown,
low-traffic Web sites to $200,000 for commercial sites. The amount
MP3.com will pay was not disclosed. Fees for online licenses are
minuscule compared with those paid to ASCAP by television and radio
stations. But as the Web continues to grow, such payments could
come to represent substantial income for ASCAP and the composers it
represents.
</P>
<P>
   The MP3 format is the most popular way of distributing music
online. It is revered by denizens of the Web and reviled by the
music industry because MP3 files have no built-in copyright
protections and performers, songwriters, publishers and recording
companies receive no income when users copy and distribute
MP3-encoded music.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to MP3's growing popularity, the Record Industry
Association of America, which represents all the major labels, last
December formed the Secure Digital Music Initiative, a joint
attempt by record companies, the computer industry and
manufacturers of consumer electronics devices to create a standard
technology for selling and transmitting music over the Internet.
Though the group's leaders promised to release a standard by June
30, over the last few months the major record companies have struck
individual alliances, suggesting that the group is having
difficulty reaching a consensus.
</P>
<P>
   In the last four months, MP3.com has doubled the number of
artists it features, to 12,000. Last week, Cox Enterprises Inc.
announced that it was investing $45 million in MP3.com in return
for an undisclosed equity stake.
</P>
<P>
   The economic pressures of a growing business may compel MP3.com
to distance itself further from its underground roots, industry
analysts say. It is one thing to open up a Web site to all
performers who wish to make their music available, but it is
another matter to handle copyright and distribution issues for all
those artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're fast approaching the point where they may have
to abandon the ideals of a grass-roots music company,'' said Mark
Hardie, a senior analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass.
``Increasingly, MP3.com is looking more like a traditional record
company.''

INTEL SHARES DROP 5 PERCENT AS NEW PENTIUM PROCESSOR IS DELAYED  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE M. FISHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Shares of the Intel Corp. dropped by more than 5
percent Friday after the company informed personal computer
manufacturers that its faster Pentium III processor would be
delayed by two months.
</P>
<P>
   Intel shares closed at $54.9375, down $3.0625, in Nasdaq
trading. Two analysts lowered their earnings estimates, but the
consensus remained unchanged for the current quarter, at 54 cents a
diluted share, according to First Call.
</P>
<P>
   The delay will affect a version of the Pentium III that will
achieve increased speeds by using tinier circuits. This requires a
new manufacturing process that reduces the width of each wire
etched in silicon to 0.18 micron, from the current 0.25 micron.
Analysts said it could slow revenue growth in the second half of
the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first time I can remember that they had a problem
ramping up a process, and this is clearly being delayed because
they can't carry it off as rapidly as they thought,'' said Mark
Edelstone, an analyst with Morgan Stanley Dean Witter who cut his
earnings estimate for the year and lowered his recommendation on
Intel stock from strong buy to outperform. ``I don't think they
have a lot of downside risk, but this will diminish what would have
been growth catalysts for Intel over the next few months.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel had said it would deliver three versions of the Pentium
III on 0.18 technology, running at 600 megahertz, in the second
half of the year. ``That is still true,'' said Tom Waldrup, an
Intel spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   A mobile version will not be delayed, but will ship initially at
a 500-megahertz speed, and the server and work station versions
will not be affected, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that we've been able to deliver 600 megahertz
this summer with our 0.25 micron process, which we hadn't
anticipated,'' Waldrup said. ``The change in schedule will not
materially affect our financial results.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel will report earnings on July 13.
</P>
<P>
   Reducing the size of circuits offers several advantages
including higher speed, lower cost, less power consumption and less
heat. Intel's ability to move its chips to successively more
advanced process technology has been one key to its competitive
advantage over rivals like Advanced Micro Devices Inc., which has
struggled with such transitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing we have all learned about yield problems at
Intel is, unlike at amD, they don't last months, they last weeks if
not days,'' said Michael Murphy, editor of the California
Technology Stock Letter.
</P>
<P>
   He characterized the market reaction as ``just silly,'' adding
that he was buying Intel shares Friday.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew has decided to remove at
least five superintendents because he has lost confidence in their
ability to lead and to improve student achievement, a top aide said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The aide, Chiara Coletti, Crew's director of public affairs,
said the superintendents would be identified next week, and other
dismissals may follow.
</P>
<P>
   Other aides said the superintendents to be removed included two
of the five boroughwide superintendents who oversee high schools,
along with several of the 32 district superintendents, who
supervise elementary and middle schools. It was not clear Friday
night whether the superintendents had been notified.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the chancellor had said he planned to take action
against superintendents and principals in districts where large
numbers of students performed poorly on state and citywide tests.
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has also called for the removal of
principals in low-performing districts.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday, Ms. Coletti said the coming dismissals would not be
based solely on test scores and that Crew was not limiting his
actions to the school districts with the worst performance.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, she said, he is looking at factors like whether there
was an achievement gap between whites and Asian students, on one
hand, and black and Hispanic students, on the other; and how well
superintendents were meeting the needs of low-income students,
immigrants and special-education students. He was also looking at
their ability to supervise teachers and principals, divide their
budgets fairly among all schools in the district, and develop and
carry out new curriculums.
</P>
<P>
   Such a wholesale shake-up has ``never been done in the history
of the school system that we know of,'' Ms. Coletti said. But she
said the chancellor had the power to act under the school
governance law approved in Albany in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The removals will mark Crew's most aggressive use of his
expanded powers under the new law, which was prompted by
allegations of patronage and corruption among local school boards.
It shifted many powers to the chancellor and district
superintendents, and gave the chancellor broad powers over
superintendents, including hiring them from a list put together by
local school boards and dismissing them.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Coletti said some of the superintendents being removed from
their positions would be pushed into retirement, some would be
dismissed outright and others would be offered lower-ranking jobs
within the school system. Some superintendents, she said, might
have failed in their current jobs but would be assets to the system
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes after both city and state standardized tests have
shown a decline in achievement among city schoolchildren. One out
of five city students scored in the bottom level of a new state
fourth-grade reading test, meaning that they could barely read or
write.
</P>
<P>
   Crew has promised to move aggressively to hold administrators,
teachers and students accountable for results.

 &HT;    All bets are on in interstate NBA rivalry
 &HT;    By Christian Davenport
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ U.S. Sen. Phil Gramm fired the first salvo from
his Washington office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eat our dust, city boy,'' he said to his New York counterpart,
Sen. Charles Schumer. ``And, hey, what the heck is a Knick
anyhow?''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer fired back as quickly as a Texas outlaw: ``Even Davy
Crockett couldn't help the Spurs pull this one off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the beginning of the National Basketball Association
championship series, which pits the New York Knicks against the San
Antonio Spurs, harsh words and wagers have been flying between the
Empire State and the Lone Star State.
</P>
<P>
   If the Spurs win, Democrat Schumer has vowed to send Republican
Gramm smoked salmon, bagels and cannolis from New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the heck is a cannoli?'' Gramm said. ``I guess I'll be
finding out soon.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Knicks win, Gramm has to send Schumer a case of wine from
Lubbock's Llano Estacado Winery and Mars candies from Waco.
</P>
<P>
   They are not the only state leaders laying it on the line.
</P>
<P>
   San Antonio Mayor Howard Peak wagered a case of Lone Star beer,
tamales and chips and salsa against New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's Brooklyn Beer, Nathan's hot dogs and cheesecake from
Junior's restaurant in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   They added a touch of humiliation to whoever loses the bet: The
loser has to wear the opponent's baseball cap in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to seeing him wear that hat,'' Peak said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush is betting New York Gov. George Pataki
a pair of cowboy boots _ with spurs, of course. Pataki said he'll
send Bush sandwiches from Ben's Best Deli and a dozen bagels.

COMMENTARY: POST-LITTLETON LOONY TUNES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By FRANK RICH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Bill Clinton and Henry Hyde band together to protect the
morals of America's youth, it must be time to lock up our
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   What brought these two former antagonists together is the
tragedy of Littleton _ well, not so much the tragedy of Littleton,
but the chance to exploit the tragedy of Littleton for political
profit. Polls show that most Americans regard violent pop culture
as an unindicted co-conspirator in the massacre perpetrated by Eric
Harris and Dylan Klebold. So why not a quick fix, with or without a
toothless dash of gun control, that will accomplish nothing beyond
impressing the most harried or clueless suburban parents?
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, displaying the same linguistic flair that led him to
describe an adulterous affair in his 40s as a ``youthful
indiscretion,'' believes that the entertainment industry ``gets
away, literally, with murder.'' He promoted his scheme to stamp out
media homicide in a Washington Post op-ed essay this week that
approvingly quoted the recent moral pronouncements of the very
president he had vilified as the Antichrist. But congressman Hyde's
effort to rid books, movies, TV and even sculpture of ``toxic
waste'' fared no better than his impeachment crusade. His bill was
so broadly written that even Bob Barr voted against its vision of a
Soviet-scale bureaucracy with license to censor everything from
``Home Alone'' to TV news of atrocities in Kosovo to the Brothers
Grimm.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, Hyde, Barr and other culture warriors of the right
signed on to Plan B: an equally unconstitutional bill that aspires
to counter Hollywood values by permitting the display of the Ten
Commandments in public schools. Perhaps Congress should be the
guinea pig for this scheme: Let's post the tablets in the House
chamber for a year, then administer polygraph tests to see if it
has prevented each member from violating the Commandments _
especially numbers three, four, seven, nine and ten.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's phony two-pronged contribution to the war on Hollywood
is no less frivolous. His commission of a year-plus, $1 million
study to determine whether the entertainment industry deliberately
merchandises violence to kids seems mainly conceived to give Al
Gore a photo op at the height of election season. To find out that
yes, Hollywood does sell violence to teen-agers, its largest
audience, all you need is the price of a movie ticket and 15
minutes to spend watching previews.
</P>
<P>
   The other presidential gambit _ the carding of
under-17-year-olds trying to sneak into R-rated movies _ is pork
for the phony-I.D. market and unenforceable at any multiplex with
more screens than ticket-checking employees. Just watch what
happens once June 30 brings the first nationwide test: the opening
of ``South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut,'' the R-rated adaptation
of the satirical, violence-flecked animated TV series about
rebellious kids whose co-creator, Matt Stone, grew up, as it
happens, in Littleton. The entire market for ``South Park'' is
under-R-age teen-agers, and, as its producer Scott Rudin candidly
told Entertainment Weekly back in April, ``they'll figure out a way
to get in under the radar.'' Any parent knows that the only real
hope for keeping a determined teen-ager out of an R-rated movie may
be to change its rating to an uncool PG.
</P>
<P>
   Transparently cosmetic as the president's palliatives are, he is
being given credit for taking on his deep-pocketed Hollywood
friends. He doesn't deserve it, for, despite some knee-jerk howls
of McCarthyism from the vicinity of Morton's, he has done nothing
to seriously threaten the movie industry's status quo. He's as
disingenuous a guardian of family values as some of his Republican
counterparts, who have show-biz alliances as tight as the
president's to Dreamworks.

 UNDATED: to Dreamworks.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The GOP answer to Clinton in cynicism is, predictably, William
Bennett. The bodies had hardly been buried in Littleton when Mr.
Virtue took to the pulpit of ``Meet the Press'' to target ``the
Levins, the Bronfmans, the people who run Viacom'' for spewing
cultural rot; in testimony before Congress the following week he
singled out ``the Edgar Bronfmans, Howard Stringers, Michael
Eisners and Oliver Stones.'' Hmmm. Who's missing from this litany
of rogues? The Republican fat cat Rupert Murdoch, whose movie
studio, Fox, will bring out what may be the most violent (and
perhaps most entertaining) summer movie, ``Fight Club,'' which, in
the screenplay I've read, opens with a handgun barrel lodged in its
hero's mouth and ratchets up from there. Since ``Fight Club'' stars
Edward Norton and Brad Pitt and has been directed by the gifted
David Fincher (of the grisly ``Seven''), it is prime teen-age bait,
but I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for Bennett to campaign
against it or any other Murdoch product as he has against Eisner's
relatively tame ``Scream.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that just as the Democrats have their own
handmaidens for the National Rifle Association _ John Dingell of
Michigan, who collaborated with the GOP whip, Tom DeLay, to
sabotage already mild gun-control legislation this week _ so the
Republicans are increasingly in bed with show biz, and not just
with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Murdoch. In 1997-98, according to
the Center for Responsive Politics, more than half of the
entertainment industry's corporate contributions went to the GOP.
The party's presumed standard-bearer, George W. Bush, has served on
the board of Silver Screen, the company that helped finance the
first R-rated movies at Eisner's Disney _ though, to his credit,
Bush has so far spared us any hypocritical sermons about pop
culture.
</P>
<P>
   There's something almost cruel about those politicians who do
give us those sermons _ and empty promises of action _ in the
aftermath of Littleton. Instead of pandering to frightened parents
by prescribing placebos, they might tell voters the truth. For even
if Washington would or could ``clean up'' Hollywood without
violating the First Amendment, there's scant evidence to suggest
that doing so would prevent a single Columbine. (Nor, by the way,
would its symbolic, Band-Aid restrictions on gun shows.) In the
sensible formulation of Jonathan Kellerman, a best-selling novelist
and clinical child psychologist, ``Movies and videogames don't turn
good kids bad, and bad kids are dangerous long before they watch
their first gorefest.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Clinton talks of hundreds of studies demonstrating a
connection between simulated violence and the real thing, but he
overstates the data. As James Q. Wilson, the conservative expert on
crime, summed up in The Times, ``No doubt violence on television
and in the movies heightens aggression among some people some of
the time, but we have virtually no evidence that it affects the
serious crime rate.'' In fact school violence and juvenile arrests,
as well as murder rates, have declined as movies have become
bloodier. ``The Matrix'' _ an engaging, not desensitizing, movie
that gave me and my 15-year-old son much to talk about _ may well
defuse, not provoke, adolescent male anger.
</P>
<P>
   But let's say that the most egregious violent movies and games
should be toned down anyway _ not because doing so will stop one
twisted child from stealing a gun and going on a rampage but
because it will improve the overall cultural climate, especially
for children. How can we accomplish this? Sure, we can yell at
Hollywood potentates to exercise editorial restraint when making
and selling garbage, and maybe some of them will. But to get real
results in a society with free speech and a free market, we have to
vote not for pious politicians but vote with our pocketbooks for
the culture we say we want. No one is forcing American families to
subscribe to the pay-cable services that program violent movies; no
one requires adults to watch Jerry Springer in eye-popping numbers
(and then abandon him the moment his show is stripped of violence
by a circumspect TV mogul); no one has mandated that every
household purchase a bloody video or computer game (90 percent of
which are bought by adults).
</P>
<P>
   The only politician _ past or present _ who has had the guts to
say out loud that Americans bear some responsibility for the
culture they get is a Texan who isn't running for anything this
year. In the aftermath of Columbine, he told Larry King that if
``we weren't watching'' junk, Hollywood wouldn't shower us with it,
and that ``if we wanted great positive entertainment for our
children and we watched it, that's where the ads would be (and)
where the industry would be.''
</P>
<P>
   It shows just how nutty the post-Littleton cultural debate has
become when the only public figure making a sane contribution to it
is Ross Perot.  &QL;

AGREEMENT REACHED ON DEPLOYMENT OF RUSSIAN TROOPS IN KOSOVO

 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELSINKI, Finland _ Russia and the United States, ending three
days of grueling negotiations, Friday signed a military agreement
that integrates Russia into the Kosovo peacekeeping force, dividing
the bulk of 3,600 Russian troops among three of five sectors led by
NATO countries.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement broke a tense stalemate over Russia's role in
Kosovo, and opened the way for restoration of Russia's links to the
Western alliance, which Moscow froze last March when NATO launched
airstrikes against Yugoslavia, its historical ally in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our agreement recognizes the stakes that Russia and NATO share
in Europe's future,'' said Secretary of Defense William Cohen at
signing ceremonies held late Friday at Finland's presidential
palace. ``It also shows that the U.S. and Russia can work together
on important security issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The talks here began at a low point in U.S.-Russian relations,
which have been scarred by the conflict in Yugoslavia and again
last week by Moscow's sudden decision to preempt NATO by
dispatching 200 Russian paratroopers to the Kosovo capital of
Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Control over the airport is to be shared: Russian commanders
will be in charge of ground operations, while NATO will oversee air
traffic control. Under a tightly set schedule for reopening the
airfield, clearance for the arrival of six Russian planes is
expected to be given within the next week.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-won success was seen as an important sign that both
sides are eager to capitalize on Russia's critical role in the
Kosovo peace talks, and to resume a relationship that is seen as
key to Europe's security. ``The significance of this agreement goes
beyond Kosovo, as important as that is,'' Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright said Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   By agreeing to a distribution of Russian troops in sectors of
Kosovo controlled by France, Germany and the United States, Russian
negotiators stepped back from an initial demand for a separate
Russian sector in the Serbian province. That demand had been
reinforced by President Boris Yeltsin, who said in Moscow on
Thursday that he had instructed his top envoy to the talks, Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev, to stand fast on Russia's insistence for a
sector of its own.
</P>
<P>
   But at the signing ceremonies, Sergeyev and Russian foreign
minister Igor Ivanov said the compromise arrangement, thrashed out
during 33 hours of negotiation and laid out in exhaustive detail in
the final document, had met Yeltsin's requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found an alternative solution which will assure such kind
of deployment that will enable Russian troops to actively
participate in the peacekeeping operation,'' Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the agreement carried out Yeltsin's instructions,
Ivanov gave a curt reply. ``If it did not correspond to the
president's instructions, Sergeyev would not have signed,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   From the start of the talks American negotiators, acting on
behalf of their NATO allies, said they would not yield on certain
principles _ or ``red lines'' _ which included the preservation of
a unified command structure for the NATO-led force in Kosovo, and a
refusal to grant Russia a sector of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, for its part, had said it would not put its troops under
NATO command, or follow arrangements now in place for the shared
command of 1,300 Russian soldiers deployed as part of an
international peacekeeping force in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   According to a senior Defense Department official, the command
arrangement included in the agreement would give Russian commanders
a greater say in the Kosovo peacekeeping operations, at all levels.
``There is an important distinction from the Bosnia arrangement,''
he said. ``Under this arrangement, the Russian role is more
intensive, more integrated and the participation is greater.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the agreement calls for a 10-member Russian
military delegation to NATO's military headquarters, three Russian
officers posted at NATO's southern command headquarters in Naples,
Italy, and Russian commanders assigned to the NATO-led peacekeeping
forces in the three sectors where their troops will serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russian troops will be under the tactical command of KFOR,''
said Cohen Friday night, referring to the Kosovo peacekeeping
force. ``But in operational terms, political and military, they
will be answerable to the national command authority of Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the senior Defense Department official, the
agreement also gives Russian forces the right to refuse to
participate in certain operations as long as they recognize that
other forces may move in and carry out the disputed tasks. He said
the Russians were reassured that similar conditions have been
imposed on other national forces participating in the Kosovo
peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
   In NATO's view, a separate Russian sector would have resulted in
a de facto partition of Kosovo, with the Serbian population
withdrawing to the area under Russian protection, and Kosovo
Albanians dominant in the five NATO sectors, controlled by Italy,
Britain, France, Germany and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials are also concerned that the Russians, left in
control of a large patch of territory, would pull away from the
unified command structure that is considered essential to an
effective peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
   A Clinton administration official in Washington said of the
arrangement: ``It works the same way for American troops _ or those
of any other nationality _ operating under an overall NATO command.
All NATO troops are under national command, but NATO has overall
command of the mission and tactical control over those forces.''
</P>
<P>
   And President Clinton, who was in Cologne, said the arrangement
may help assure Serbs that they can stay in Kosovo. ``We think it
will give confidence to them if the Russians are in more than one
sector,'' he said.

 SIGNS GROW THAT SERBS REMOVED BODIES AT MASS GRAVES  (mk) 
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   IZBICA, Yugoslavia _ The blankets that villagers say they
wrapped the bodies in before burial lie on top of the earth, empty.
Alongside dozens of recently dug-up graves lie clusters of
discarded surgical gloves.
</P>
<P>
   Three months after American spy satellites identified this as
one of the largest sites of mass burials in Kosovo, the bodies of
the victims of a mass execution are gone, villagers said Friday.
They said Yugoslav forces fought their way into the village two
weeks ago, spent two days unearthing the bodies, said to number
119, and trucked them off.
</P>
<P>
   The tampering was on June 2 and 3, the villagers said, five days
after President Slobodan Milosevic had been indicted for war crimes
by the International War Crimes Tribunal. One of the seven mass
executions cited in the indictment is one that villagers say
occurred here on March 28, taking the lives of scores of civilians.
</P>
<P>
   A tribunal official said Friday night that the possible
disappearance of the bodies would not weaken the case against
Milosevic. ``It's extremely rare, if not impossible, to remove all
traces of a crime having been committed,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the Clinton administration released satellite photos
that showed rows of more than 100 freshly dug graves in Izbica that
they said corroborated refugees' accounts of a mass killing. Last
month, a videotape smuggled out by the Kosovo Liberation Army
showed the bodies of dozens of ethnic Albanians strewn across a
field here.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the administration has released spy photos that it
said showed tampering with the graves. On the ground Friday, there
was ample evidence to support that contention. What appeared to
have been two neat rows of graves now consists of mounds of freshly
turned earth, with clothes spread across them. The soil above the
individual graves had sunk several feet, suggesting that something
inside the graves may have been removed.
</P>
<P>
   The first members of a team of investigators sent here by the
war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, arrived Friday,
according to a spokesman for the tribunal, James Landale. The team,
he added, will begin mapping and photographing sites for
exhumations on Saturday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _
</P>
<P>
   `There are no words big enough to capture Bob Bullock. Unique
seems an understatement. Even legend or giant are not big enough.'
</P>
<P>
   _ Gov. George W. Bush
</P>
<P>
   `Bob Bullock was a man always in search of problems to be
solved. Through his creativity, he could always find a solution,
and through the force of his personality, he turned his ideas into
reality.'
</P>
<P>
   _ House Speaker Pete Laney
</P>
<P>
   `Whatever I have accomplished in the Texas Senate is owed to Bob
Bullock. When asked in the future about the great men in my life,
Bob Bullock is one of the ones who stands above the rest.'
</P>
<P>
   _ Sen. David Sibley, R-Waco
</P>
<P>
   `Bob Bullock loved Texas with every fiber of his iron fist and
kind heart. I'm glad I knew him. He truly broke the mold, and there
will never be another Texas leader like him.'
</P>
<P>
   _ Lt. Gov. Rick Perry
</P>
<P>
   `Bob Bullock loved state government _ first, last and always. He
literally gave everything he had to his public service, and no
person could be asked to do more.'
</P>
<P>
   _ Former Gov. Ann Richards
</P>
<P>
   `The story of Bob Bullock's career is the story of the
modernization of state government in Texas. But for all the
computers he bought and for all the efficiencies he achieved, Bob
Bullock never lost sight of old Texas values: independence,
dignity, loyalty, the search for truth and devotion to God and
country.'
</P>
<P>
   _ Joe Gunn, Texas AFL-CIO president
</P>
<P>
   `Among Texas Democrats, depending on the situation, Bob Bullock
was cussed or discussed, loved or loathed, but he was always
respected for his absolute dedication to our great state.'
</P>
<P>
   _ Molly Beth Malcolm, Texas Democratic Party chairwoman
</P>
<P>
   `Bob Bullock's love and passion for the state of Texas was
appreciated, admired and will be sorely missed.'
</P>
<P>
   _ Susan Weddington, Texas Republican Party chairwoman
</P>
<P>
   `(Sam) Houston, (Stephen F.) Austin, (Lyndon B.) Johnson and
(Sam) Rayburn better make room at the table for Bullock.'
</P>
<P>
   _ Railroad Commissioner Tony Garza
</P>
<P>
   `Bob Bullock doesn't remind you of anybody else.'

   BOND YIELD FALLS BELOW 6 PERCENT; STOCKS POST SMALL GAINS
</P>
<P>
   Treasury bonds turned in their best weekly performance in more
than eight months on expectations that the Federal Reserve will
raise interest rates by only a quarter percentage point later this
month. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond fell to 5.97 percent
from 6.16 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 13.93 points, to
10,855.56, while the broader Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index was
up 2.94 points, to 1,342.84. The NASDAQ composite index rose 19.29
points, to 2,563.44. The market outlook improved with comments on
Thursday by the chairman of the Fed, Alan Greenspan, who suggested
that a modest pre-emptive interest-rate increase would obviate the
need for more drastic action later.
</P>
<P>
   FOREIGN SALES ARE HURTING GILLETTE
</P>
<P>
   Gillette is being dragged down by the weak international
performance of some products, including Braun electric shavers,
shaving cream and stationery, while its main business line of
blades and razors is doing well. On Thursday, Gillette's management
warned investors that second-quarter profits would fall 20 percent,
to about 26 cents a share. Wall Street analysts had been expecting
29 cents, after some previous downward revisions.

   LICENSING DEAL FOR MUSIC WEB SITE
</P>
<P>
   Delivering music over the Internet won an important measure of
legitimacy this week when the American Society of Composers,
Authors and Publishers announced a licensing deal with the music
Web site MP3.com. Under the agreement, songwriters whose work is
offered on MP3.com and who agree to pay ASCAP a $10 membership fee
will receive royalty payments based on how often their music is
downloaded or purchased as a compact disk.
</P>
<P>
   SHARES OF INTEL FALL ON DELAY NEWS
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Intel dropped more than 5 percent, or $3.0625, to
$54.9375, after the company informed personal computer
manufacturers that a faster version of its Pentium III processor
would be delayed by two months. Two analysts lowered their earnings
estimates, but the consensus remained unchanged for the current
quarter, at 54 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   A SPOILER: MEXICO'S BANKING SYSTEM
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, a newly created federal bank insurance agency has
initiated a $1.3 billion bailout of the nation's third-largest
bank, Grupo Financiero Serfin, and is considering a $9 billion
cleanup of Bancrecer.
</P>
<P>
   LAWSUIT DRAWS ATTENTION TO NAFTA
</P>
<P>
   A $970 million lawsuit against the U.S. government by a Canadian
fuel additive manufacturer has focused attention on a clause in the
North American Free Trade Agreement that experts say may have to be
rewritten. It allows companies to sue the governments of the United
States, Canada or Mexico if export opportunities are lost for
reasons unrelated to normal commerce.
</P>
<P>
   COMMERCIAL BANKS ARE PROSPERING
</P>
<P>
   Improved international operations and strong trading revenue
helped commercial banks book record profits in the first quarter of
1999, Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said. Insured commercial
banks earned $18 billion in net income in the first three months of
this year.

   ADOBE SHARES UP ON EARNINGS NEWS
</P>

   Shares of Adobe Systems rose 12 percent after the company, a

YOUNG WIDOW INDICTED FOR KILLING OLD HUSBAND FOR HIS MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Nev.)   (bl)  
 By SELWYN RAAB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The marriage of Andrew Vlasto, 85, to a woman 57
years his junior lasted only three months before Vlasto, a member
of a prominent Greek-American family here, died.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, almost six years after the wedding, the widow, Sylvia
Mitchell, was indicted in Manhattan on charges that she had killed
her husband with lethal drug cocktails in a scheme to acquire more
than $500,000 from his bank accounts and his real estate holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mitchell, now 33, was extradited Friday from Las Vegas,
where she had been living, and charged with manslaughter in the
second degree and 11 counts of grand larceny, attempted grand
larceny and perjury.
</P>
<P>
   To obtain under state law a conviction of second-degree
manslaughter, the prosecution must prove that Ms. Mitchell caused
Vlasto's death through reckless actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our theory of the case is that she intended to steal his
property and that she drugged him, not meaning to kill him, but to
keep him in a drug-induced state so she could steal his assets,''
Daniel Castleman, the chief of the Investigation Division in the
Manhattan district attorney's office, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mitchell pleaded not guilty in Manhattan state Supreme Court
on Friday. She was ordered held without bail until a hearing July
28.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of manslaughter, she faces a maximum penalty of 15
years in prison. She faces an additional 15 years if found guilty
of stealing $95,000 from her husband in 1993, attempting to steal
more than $100,000 from a money market account and lying in court
depositions after his death in an attempt to obtain about $400,000
in real estate and bank accounts in Greece.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mitchell's lawyer, Barry Fallick, said in an interview that
he might move to have the indictment dismissed on the ground that
her due-process rights were violated.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could have indicted her six years ago,'' Fallick said.
``The delay makes it more difficult to find witnesses and evidence
that could exonerate her.''
</P>
<P>
   Vlasto was a lawyer and a banker in Greece before immigrating to
the United States in 1947 and working as an editor for Atlantis, a
Greek language newspaper owned by relatives. After Atlantis ceased
publication in 1974, he organized a company that sold church
supplies, and looked after his investments.
</P>
<P>
   A bachelor, Vlasto lived frugally in a one-room apartment in the
Chelsea section of Manhattan. His relatives said he became
reclusive in the early 1990s, and in August 1993, he married Ms.
Mitchell, who was then 28.
</P>
<P>
   At Ms. Mitchell's arraignment Friday, Youmin Kim, a prosecutor,
said Vlasto was so infirm on his wedding day that Ms. Mitchell had
to carry him into the chapel of a Pentecostal minister in Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Soon afterward, the prosecutors said, Ms. Mitchell obtained a
joint bank account giving her access to Vlasto's savings. In
September and October 1993, she withdrew $95,000, including the
wire transfer of $70,000 to the Taj Mahal Casino in Atlantic City,
N.J., in her name, according to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1993, Vlasto's relatives learned of the marriage
after his neighbors informed them that he had collapsed and was in
Bellevue Hospital. He died in the hospital on Nov. 10, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Over the objections of Ms. Mitchell, an autopsy was performed by
the City Medical Examiner's office. Vlasto's death was attributed
to pneumonia and sepsis, which is a toxic infection, ``complicated
by an overdose of benzodiazepines, barbiturates and opiates,''
drugs that had not been administered to him by the hospital's
staff.
</P>
<P>
   Vlasto did not leave a will, and Ms. Mitchell's attempt to
obtain his entire estate was blocked by Vlasto's relatives. In a
1994 settlement, she was allowed to keep what remained of the
$95,000 withdrawn from his bank accounts but waived all rights to
the rest of his estate.
</P>
<P>
   James Vlasto, a nephew of Andrew Vlasto, praised the district
attorney's office for pursuing charges against Ms. Mitchell.
``Other law enforcement agencies should follow New York's lead and
give a high priority to aggressively pursuing cases involving the
murders, abuses and exploitation of the elderly,'' Vlasto said.

 &HT;    Hamm breaks out of leg casts into soccer world
 &HT;    By John Maher
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Mia Hamm often is identified with the University
of North Carolina, the school where she and her
I-can-do-anything-better-than-you commercial co-star, Michael
Jordan, won national championships. Yet it was in Texas that Hamm,
international soccer's all-time leading scorer, first learned that
sport and many others, including tackle football.
</P>
<P>
   ``All our children have Texas roots,'' said Stephanie Hamm,
Mia's mother. Stephanie and Bill Hamm, a retired Air Force colonel,
settled in Austin three years ago and lived in Wichita Falls and
San Antonio when Mia was growing up.
</P>
<P>
   The Hamms recently returned from a trip to Oregon, where Nike
dedicated a building _ even bigger than Michael's _ to their
daughter. They will travel to some of the U.S. women's World Cup
matches.
</P>
<P>
   Mia Hamm and the U.S. national team open the World Cup
tournament at 2 p.m. today against Denmark in East Rutherford, N.J.
Mia &AMP; Co. are favored to win the tournament and garner millions of
new fans.
</P>
<P>
   Little girls already shriek Mia's name. A few years ago, People
magazine anointed her one of its 50 Most Beautiful People, and
she's on her way to becoming the most marketable female athlete on
the planet.
</P>
<P>
   Her success story seems so smooth, so well-orchestrated. It is
however, quite an improbable one, tinged with pain and tragedy as
well as serendipity and triumph. It reflects the journey of her
family around Texas and the world and through life.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer first entered the Hamms' life while Bill was at squadron
officer's school in Montgomery, Ala. It was no big deal at the
time. Just another mandatory activity he had at a Friday sports
day, like volleyball. When the military says have fun, you have
fun, sir!
</P>
<P>
   Mia was just a few months old then, and Fridays were anything
but fun for her. That was her day for orthopedic treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was born with some problems with her legs,'' Bill
explained. ``They diagnosed it as a partial club foot. So the first
few months, she was in casts. She grew up and had these little
backwards shoes. They're curved out instead of in. There were
braces in between to keep the proper distance, and there were
little screws in the bottom to keep them at the right angles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She had to sleep with them,'' Stephanie interjects.
``Instruments of torture. Our second daughter was born that way,
and they weren't nearly as aggressive, and her legs turned out
beautifully. And then Mia was born and had the same thing, and the
doctors just flipped out. They said, `She's going to have to be in
casts for the first four months of her life. Then you're going to
have to put her in these braces.'''
</P>
<P>
   More than a quarter of a century has passed, but Stephanie's
voice still cracks and shrinks as she recalls, ``She and I would
get in the bathtub at 4 o'clock in the morning every Friday to melt
those casts. You had to get them all wet and then pull them off.
She was so little, and she cried ... And then we'd drive to the
appointment. They'd rotate the legs a little more.''
</P>
<P>
   And put on more casts. The treatments stopped only by accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``We moved so far away that there was nothing we could do,''
Stephanie said. In Florence, Italy, where Bill landed on a
post-graduate scholarship, the Hamms made do with high-top shoes
for Mia.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie recalled, ``We were stuck in an apartment, and the
kids didn't get out much. But we had this huge hall that was at the
entrance of our apartment, and she'd just run up and down and up
and down and up and down like she was practicing getting her feet
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Little Mia was running. And speaking and gesturing in Italian.
That's all the family spoke at home, trying, as Bill's scholarship
charged, to immerse themselves in Italian culture. Florence is
famous for its art galleries, but Bill found that on Mondays, no
one in the coffee houses and restaurants talked about art or much
of anything else except soccer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no other sports over there,'' Bill said. ``If you
ever wanted to discuss something on Monday you had to go to the
soccer match on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   He bought season passes, and the family's Sunday began revolving
around soccer. If the team was out of town, they'd visit friends.
If it was at home, they were at the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   A brother to play with
</P>
<P>
   The Hamms moved to Wichita Falls in 1976, and Texas, like many
other states, was getting a big soccer push. The North American
Soccer League's New York Cosmos had signed Brazilian star Pele to a
three-year contract in 1975 in an attempt to bring the world's game
to the world's most lucrative market.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Mia might not have thrived in or even tried the game except
for a change in the family. The Hamms, a family with four girls,
decided to adopt a boy. They ended up adopting two. And in Garrett,
an 8-year-old Thai American orphan, Mia acquired an instant older
brother.
</P>
<P>
   While the girls in the family liked to read, Garrett loved to
run. He was soon playing Pop Warner football and then switched to
soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Bill said, ``I got involved first just going to the practices.
Then I got into helping the coach. Then I got into refereeing. It
was because he was involved that she got involved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She stuck to him like glue,'' Stephanie said. ``She realized
that it was OK to be competitive once Garrett came into our lives.
I think Mia had this desire to bust a gusset and go for broke, and
it wasn't until she got to play with Garrett and his friends that
she realized it was OK to just throw yourself into that. He loved
playing any kind of game, and she played any sport around.''
</P>
<P>
   Mia was small and shy, and sports were her way of making herself
known. ``You moved to a new base and made new friends as soon as
you joined a team,'' Mia has said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, when Mia was 8, the family moved to San Antonio. Bill
wound up coaching a kids' team a year later. By the fall of 1982,
it was a ``select'' team for only the best players. Back in Wichita
Falls in 1983, Mia still wasn't specializing. At a small school
that didn't have enough players for football, she suited up as a
cornerback-wide receiver. As a high school sophomore, she played on
the boys soccer team along with several other girls.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1986 she tried out for a regional soccer team.
</P>
<P>
   John Cossaboon, then coaching a North Texas regional team and
now women's soccer coach at San Diego State, recalled, ``We had
state teams in all different age groups, and I heard from different
people that there was this great player in Wichita Falls, so we got
her down for a tryout. She blew you away with her acceleration and
her natural athleticism. A few can accelerate like that, and some
people can sustain their speed for 60 yards, but to have both, I've
not seen it since.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mia was quiet. She let her game do her talking, and she was
always concerned with how the team did. She was ahead of the rest.
We learned more from her than we actually gave to her, and it goes
far beyond soccer,'' Cossaboon said.
</P>
<P>
   Shot out of a cannon
</P>
<P>
   Cossaboon shared his find with Anson Dorrance, who coached the
U.S. national team. Dorrance has said he's usually skeptical of
such tips. He came to Texas to see Mia play, but didn't want to
know who she was. He wanted to see if she could make herself known.
</P>
<P>
   That took all of a couple of seconds. Dorrance has described the
opening kick this way, ``I saw this kid accelerate like she was
shot out of a cannon. Without seeing her touch the ball, I ran
around saying, `Is that Mia Hamm?'''
</P>
<P>
   At 15, Hamm became the youngest-ever member on the U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   Dorrance was also the coach at North Carolina, and Mia enrolled
there. Jordan won one NCAA championship at that school. Hamm did
much better than that, capturing four. She also played on the U.S.
team that captured the inaugural women's World Cup in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 she married Christiaan Corry, a Marine helicopter pilot
she met while they were both students at North Carolina. In 1996
she starred for soccer's Dream Team, the U.S. squad that won a gold
medal in the Atlanta Olympics before a crowd of 76,489, the largest
ever to see a women's sporting event. After winning the gold, Mia
hugged Garrett.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, tragedy followed triumph. Years earlier, Garrett had been
diagnosed with a rare disease, aplastic anemia. Aplastic anemia
results from a failure of the bone marrow to produce adequate
quantities of the essential blood components. It worsened to the
point that he needed a bone marrow transplant, a difficult
procedure made even more risky by his distinct genetic background.
His natural father served as a donor, and the operation at first
appeared to be a success.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie and Bill Hamm moved to Austin in part to be near M.D.
Anderson, the hospital in Houston where Garrett would receive
treatment. But he developed a fungal infection that was too much
for his weakened immune system and died in April 1997 at 28.
</P>
<P>
   Mia missed the first two games for the U.S. squad after his
death. When she rejoined the team for a game against South Korea,
her teammates showed their support by donning black armbands. The
U.S. squad is a team in the true sense of the word, probably
because Mia so unselfishly shares the praise heaped on her.
</P>
<P>
   Although the U.S. players have tried to downplay it, the
pressure on them to win the World Cup will be enormous, and
millions around the world will be watching the every move of Mia,
who not all that long ago was a brown-eyed slip of a girl playing
on the Texas sandlots.

TOUGHER, HIGHER, STRONGER: PINEHURST IS THE DAZZLER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ The conditions got tougher, the scores got
higher and the leader board got even stronger. The first 36 holes
of the U.S. Open have been intriguing, but the final two days
should be memorable.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's second round ended with three of the world's top
players tied for first place: David Duval, Phil Mickelson and Payne
Stewart. Meanwhile, former major tournament winners like Tiger
Woods, Vijay Singh and Hal Sutton lurked close behind. All faced
the challenge of beating each other while trying to remain composed
on a difficult course that is expected to become even more
unyielding.
</P>
<P>
   With only seven players in the tournament under par through two
rounds, Stewart, Duval and Mickelson ended the day at
three-under-par 137, while Woods, Sutton, Singh and Billy Mayfair
were all two strokes behind at one under par. How difficult was it
to play 18 holes at Pinehurst Resort and Country Club's fabled No.
2 course on Friday? The best score was 69, accomplished by only
three players, Stewart, Jeff Maggert and John Huston. The bright
sunshine made the turtleback greens harder, faster and more
diabolical, and to make matters worse, unpredictable wind gusts
often made club selection a guessing game.
</P>
<P>
   It is anyone's guess who will win, but a leader board with an
abundance of star power should produce ample fireworks. Saturday's
final twosome will be Duval and Stewart, while the next-to-last
twosome will be Mickelson and Woods. And imagine a Sunday showdown
that could feature Duval, Woods and Mickelson, three under-30 stars
who have never battled during the final holes of a major. Duval
would welcome it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would love to be part of a battle,'' Duval said after his
even-par 70. ``It's kind of like they talk about different
rivalries. As long as I'm part of the rivalry, I'm all for them.
But I just hope I'm in that position.''
</P>
<P>
   To become part of the Sunday battle, however, all the contenders
will have to hold their own on Saturday. And that will be
difficult. Pinehurst played more like Pinehurst Friday than it did
on Thursday, when rain softened the greens and gave players more
margin for error on their approach shots. On Friday, the margin for
error was minuscule. Any shot that was not placed with pinpoint
accuracy on the green was in danger of rolling off, sometimes 35 or
40 feet from where it landed. Meanwhile, chipping up the slopes at
Pinehurst can be like chipping a golf ball up a slide. If you do
not hit it hard enough, it will come back to you.
</P>
<P>
   At Pinehurst, you cannot breathe easy when the ball lands on the
green. You can only exhale when the ball finally stops rolling, and
sometimes that takes a while. Duval, Mayfair and John Daly, who
stumbled to a second-round 77, each watched the ball roll down a
slope and off the green, leading to a double-bogey. Only the most
resilient players managed to cope. And Mickelson, who shot a 70,
was glad to be among that group.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have taken 70 at the start, and I'm very pleased with
70 at the end,'' said Mickelson, who started the day tied for first
place at three under par with Duval, Mayfair and Paul Goydos, who
fell to one over par after Friday's 74. ``The goal is to make pars
as you stand on each tee box. You just don't know when you're going
to make birdies. You want to give yourself a 30-footer, but it's
still not easy to make 30-footers here. Just keep making pars and
let things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who had a 7:50 a.m. tee time, shot a 69 and was in the
clubhouse relaxing before much of the field had reached the back
nine. For Stewart, who won the Open in 1991 and finished second in
1993 and '98, the weekend represents another chance to win the
major that best suits his game. And he left the course Friday
feeling confident about his chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm playing better at the U.S. Open than I played
last year,'' Stewart said. ``I feel I've got more control over my
golf game, and over my swing.''
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how much control you have, Pinehurst can make you
lose it. Even the normally steady Duval had an up-and-down round
that featured five birdies, three bogeys and a double-bogey. After
Duval birdied No. 2 and No. 5 to reach five under par, he made a
rare double-bogey at the par-3 No. 6. After hitting his tee shot
into a bunker, Duval blasted out fairly softly, but not softly
enough to stay on these greens. After landing about six feet from
the pin, the ball kept rolling and rolling as the gallery groaned,
never stopping until it was off the green. Then Duval chipped to
five feet, but he missed the putt.
</P>
<P>
   Unfazed, Duval birdied the next two holes to reach five under
again, but he bogeyed two of the next three holes. Afterward, he
was happy to have a share of the lead, and his sanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy what it does to you as a player, how it makes you a
little goofy at times,'' Duval said. ``I think that's the beauty of
this tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a tournament that remained far from decided. Mickelson,
who used his terrific short game to get up and down from several
precarious situations, said that his wife, Amy, was still not
expected to deliver their first child until June 30. Mickelson
expected to be around for the entire tournament, and he also hoped
to stay in contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spent the past month working on my short game, and I feel
it's as good as it has been in years,'' Mickelson said. Would it be
good enough to win the U.S. Open? The weekend would reveal the
answer. But all of the contenders agreed on one thing. If any
player finished the weekend under par, he would probably leave with
a trophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you're going to see players backing up,'' Duval said.
``The greens are going to get harder and faster. Even par is going
to be a real nice position come Sunday about 7 o'clock. And if
you're one or two over, you might not be too bad either.''

DANGER IS NOW MODANO'S MIDDLE NAME 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, N.Y.)  (mk) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE

<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ A few years ago, when Mark Messier was a Ranger,
he checked Mike Modano of the Dallas Stars so hard that Modano
sustained a concussion. When the medics tried to lift Modano into
an ambulance on a stretcher, they accidentally dropped him. So
Modano knows that a hockey rink can be a dangerous place.
</P>
<P>
   His current injury, a damaged left wrist, prevents him from
shooting pucks as well as he usually does. Modano has no goals in
the Stanley Cup finals, which his team leads by 3 games to 2 over
the Buffalo Sabres, with Game 6 on Saturday night in Marine Midland
Arena.
</P>
<P>
   But Modano's feet are fine. He skated well in a 2-0 victory in
Dallas' Reunion Arena on Thursday night, a mean-spirited affair
that left both teams talking tough Friday. Modano even kicked a
pass with his skate for his second of two assists, which left him
with five for the series, the most points of any player in this
round, and 21 points for the playoffs, tied for the team lead with
Joe Nieuwendyk.
</P>
<P>
   And there is nothing wrong with Modano's heart. Earlier in his
career, he was typecast as a skillful artiste who avoided the
dangerous places where good players go to get great. In his 10th
season, Modano now absorbs punishment to make important plays. When
he slips into his old ways, Stars coach Ken Hitchcock talks to him,
as he did by telephone before Game 5. Even opponents have noticed
the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed to be getting in traffic a little more,'' said Mike
Peca, the captain of the Sabres. ``He was working down low a lot
better. Obviously, he's very comfortable with the wrist injury. We
want to make sure we make him a target again, not to go after his
injury by any means, but just make sure we're finishing him like we
were earlier in the series.''
</P>
<P>
   This would be in the spirit of Thursday's conclusion, when Rhett
Warrener of Buffalo tried to attack Derian Hatcher of Dallas. When
the big defensemen grappled and fell, Warrener broke his leg,
ending his season. Sabres coach Lindy Ruff said Friday that his
players would target Modano and other Stars on Saturday. Peca said
the Stars were a dirty team. Hitchcock, who argued with Ruff at the
benches after the buzzer, said that Ruff wanted to start trouble by
sending out Warrener to get Hatcher.
</P>
<P>
   Modano's injury came during Game 2 on a legal check into the
boards by Jay McKee, a Sabres defenseman who said Friday that each
round gets ``a little more chippier, a little more dirtier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to keep your head up,'' McKee said.
</P>
<P>
   Modano has since played with pregame injections of pain-killing
medication and a soft cast on the forearm. There is nothing wrong
with his vision. Early in Game 5, he saw Peca barrelling toward him
for a high, hard hit that might have endangered a few more body
parts. Modano dodged it and Peca sprawled. Modano said he
understood the intent.
</P>
<P>
   ``You circle names at the start of the game, which guys you go
after,'' Modano said. ``I'm sure mine's circled. We have a few of
their guys circled. That's the kind of hockey I've learned to enjoy
the last couple years. They push me to the limits. That's what I
want.''
</P>
<P>
   When Modano returned from the injury, he said the Sabres hacked
his wrist with sticks. He responded with three consecutive
penalties, one of them a serious slash. His ordeal typifies that of
an older, experienced Dallas team that plays an exhausting style of
body contact and checking effort. Brett Hull returned to the Stars'
lineup Thursday after missing almost two games with a groin injury.
Benoit Hogue played despite a badly damaged knee that will require
off-season surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Steadily improving in the six seasons since they moved from
Minnesota, the Stars are one victory away from what Nieuwendyk
calls ``the light at the end of the tunnel.'' As for focus, Modano
said: ``It's easy, but it's hard. That light's still a long way
away, a glimmer in the distance. It's a great position. The deeper
you have to go, the more gratifying and satisfying it is when you
come out on top. Guys are very hungry and very excited about this.
It's a real weird feeling. You have butterflies.''

REGENTS EXAM TESTS NERVE, AS WELL AS ENGLISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In their first crack at one of the new and stiffer
high school exams that are meant to raise academic standards in New
York state, about 200,000 11th graders across the state took the
first part of the revised regents English exam Friday and many gave
it mixed reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Although the exam is crucial to graduation, it was not so bad,
said Joseph Bell, a 17-year-old at John Jay High School in the Park
Slope section of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this test was easier for everybody, even though we had
heard it was going to be harder, because we were all prepared,'' he
said after taking the three-hour exam in the morning. ``The
teachers really focused on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Angel Figueroa, another 11th grader at John Jay, said he had
prepared for the test with after-school courses and also felt
ready. ``My whole class was ready,'' he said, calling the exam
``straightforward.''
</P>
<P>
   But others admitted to having felt great trepidation.
</P>
<P>
   Kristal Ennist, a 17-year-old student at Poughkeepsie High
School, said she could not put aside thoughts of how critical the
test is for her future.
</P>
<P>
   ``You correct yourself too many times because you don't want to
get it wrong because you really, really want to pass school,'' she
said. The new exam is twice as long as any previous English regents
test, and it is meant to be more comprehensive. The first part,
given Friday, included a section in which teachers read passages
and students answered questions about them. The second three-hour
portion of the test, to be given Wednesday, will involve writing an
essay and interpreting an aspect of literature.
</P>
<P>
   The testing apparently went smoothly. State and city education
officials reported no problems.
</P>
<P>
   All of this year's 11th graders, except special education
students, will have to pass the test with a grade of 55 or better
in order to graduate in 2000. For the class of 2004, the passing
score is to be raised to 65.
</P>
<P>
   The exam is the first in a revised battery of regents tests to
be given to high school students as part of a broad drive to raise
academic standards in the state. Less demanding competency tests
are being phased out so most students will have no option other
than passing the regents exams if they want a diploma.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next three years, tougher and more comprehensive
regents exams in mathematics, social studies and science will be
introduced, and by the time this year's sixth graders graduate,
they will have been required to pass all of the new regents exams.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the self-assurance of some students, who said after the
exam that they felt fine, the pressures of the test did appear to
take a toll.
</P>
<P>
   In Poughkeepsie, English teacher Laura Ahlert said she thought
the exam was more rigorous than the model test that teachers had
used to drill students.
</P>
<P>
   ``The task they have to do is much more complicated than the
example we had,'' she said. ``It was an arduous task; you could see
it in their faces. We had one student who was physically ill during
it. She actually had to leave.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ahlert said the student returned and completed the exam.

 NYC COLUMN: COLLEGE CAST IN ODD ROLE _ LANDLORD 
</HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The hallways of Teachers College at Columbia
University in upper Manhattan form a maze so complicated that a
visitor is tempted to pull out a compass before finally finding the
two classrooms in Grace Dodge Hall that house the nonprofit
program, Brotherhood/Sister Sol.
</P>
<P>
   For the last three years, Brotherhood/Sister Sol has rented
space from Teachers College in what seemed like a perfect marriage
between a program for disadvantaged students from minority groups
and a school regarded as a national leader in training teachers.
Students at Teachers College volunteered as tutors for kids in the
program. The kids also got to use the school gym to play basketball
or kickball.
</P>
<P>
   But, now, the marriage is souring, not because of any
differences in mission or ideology, but because of the pressures of
the Manhattan real estate squeeze. Citing a space shortage for
classrooms, Teachers College has told the program's founders that
they need to be out by the end of August. It might just be another
story of an unhappy sublet except that the dispute has touched
issues as complicated as the school's labyrinthine hallways.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Brotherhood/Sister Sol began five years ago in
Providence, R.I., when two Brown University seniors, Khary
Lazarre-White, 25, and Jason Warwin, 26, created a support and
guidance program, called The Brotherhood, for 13 troubled boys from
minority groups. Then the two, childhood friends both born to
inter-racial couples in Manhattan, created The Brotherhood Inc. in
New York after their graduation with a $20,000 pledge from a
benefactor impressed by their work.
</P>
<P>
   The program grew from two chapters in 1995, at Central Park East
Secondary School in East Harlem and at East Side Community High
School on Manhattan's Lower East Side, to seven today (including
two girls' chapters), with an annual budget from private grants of
about $544,000. The 140 students attend five schools in Manhattan
and the South Bronx, and the after-school program tries to attract
teen-agers from single-parent homes who might otherwise fall
through the cracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to not only develop leadership but also critical
thinking,'' said Lazarre-White. He added, ``What is a success to
us? If a young person learns to be a good man, a good father,
responsible and caring, we consider it to be a success.''
</P>
<P>
   There are weekly chapter meetings, tutorials and required study
halls. There are summer retreats in the Berkshires, and more
ambitious trips (using grant money and proceeds of T-shirt sales)
to Morocco and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, East Side Community High School held its
commencement, and of the 15 male students who joined The
Brotherhood as sophomores, 14 graduated, with nine advancing to
college and the other six holding down full-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Lazarre-White and Warwin praise Teachers College, and its
Institute of Urban and Minority Education, for providing it with
space at below-market rents since 1996. But the pending eviction
has evolved into a bitter dispute. Dr. Sandra Wilcox, a director of
the Sister Sol program and formerly a Teachers College student and
adjunct professor, said the administration has confused its
priorities. ``I think there is the larger issue of the lack of
commitment by the school to urban education and youth,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of the school's diversity committee have protested
the eviction notice, while more than 100 Teachers College students
signed a petition opposing the move.
</P>
<P>
   Public officials, including U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel and state
Sen. David Paterson, both of Harlem, have written to school
administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Warwin said the program wants to stay for a year or two to plan
for a smooth exit and find an affordable and safe location. He said
moving now would mean a large rent spike at a time when the program
is $40,000 over its budget.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers College spokesman Barry Rosen said school
administrators gave the program more than a year's notice (a point
disputed by Lazarre-White and Warwin) and offered to help them
relocate. Rosen said rising enrollment and demand for more faculty
and research space has created a need for 10 to 15 extra rooms by
September and more by next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We value what they do tremendously,'' Rosen said. ``This has
nothing really to do with the diversity issue in any way, shape or
form. It has to do with space issues.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lazarre-White said administrators should look to the words
of the school's president, Arthur Levine, who wrote in 1997 that
the mission of Teachers College was ``educational opportunity to
all, particularly the most disadvantaged populations in our
society, and continually improving the quality of education at all
levels, especially in urban areas.''

HUDSON FESTIVAL RETURNS TO HUDSON SITE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CROTON-ON-HUDSON, N.Y. _ Starting in 1978, a music and
environmental festival called Clearwater's Great Hudson River
Revival was held every Father's Day weekend on Croton Point, a
tree-studded peninsula 20 miles up the Hudson from Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1987, the 60-year-old county dump on the same spit was
found be to leaking streams of contaminated runoff. ``The chemicals
were in puddles on the roadway,'' said Pete Seeger, the folk singer
and one of the founders of Clearwater, the private conservation
group that organizes the revival.
</P>
<P>
   So the event moved to a college campus in the middle of
Westchester County, where the only water in sight was in aquariums
full of fish and crabs in educational displays.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the revival has returned to the river for which it was
named.
</P>
<P>
   The landfill was sealed in 1995 with a watertight cap and seeded
with meadow grass. The river recovered enough for the park's beach
to be opened to swimmers two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   So the board members of Clearwater decided last year that it was
safe to return to Croton Point.
</P>
<P>
   Friday, dozens of volunteers checked in at a booth labeled
``Immaculate Reception,'' then scattered across the Westchester
park, erecting stages, painting signs and marveling at the view.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time,'' said Myrna Ross, a volunteer and
Clearwater board member who worked at the first festival on Croton
Point, a decade after it was first held as an informal fund-raising
picnic in Garrison, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day event, which includes performances by Seeger and
Arlo Guthrie, is expected to draw about 15,000 visitors.
</P>
<P>
   A truck topped with large sheets of solar panels _ providing two
kilowatts of electricity for sound and light equipment _ was next
to one stage. Seeger parked his electric-powered pickup truck
nearby, and where it was joined by a Mercedes diesel sedan rigged
to run on used cooking oil.
</P>
<P>
   In an area reserved for advocates of all stripes, John Mylod,
57, a former executive director of Clearwater and now a volunteer,
helped put up a display about sign language for the deaf.
</P>
<P>
   Mylod, a commercial shad netter from Poughkeepsie, said that
slowly, landfill by landfill, waste site by waste site, the Hudson
was getting better but still had a long way to go.
</P>
<P>
   The campground for the 800 volunteers began to fill up, and a
woman directed them to various sections: ``Noisy and campfires is
up here, quiet is down below.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Aja, the event's manager, dispatched volunteers to
prepare banners, erect fences and check cables. The festival had
been at two different locations the last two years, he said.
Surveying the point and the river, he smiled and said: ``This is
where we were meant to be. My sincere hope is that this is home.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Adrice McMichael, 10, is eager to learn this new game
about kicking a ball into a net. In jeans and a white ``Urban
Soccer Girl'' T-shirt that hangs to her knees like a dress, she
runs determinedly after the rolling sphere, the rainbow of beads in
her braids bopping behind.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard ``trying to kick the ball, trying to get it in the
goal or trying to pass it to the partners,'' Adrice says during a
brief break from the scrimmage at Lawrence C. Thompson Park on
Staten Island, in the shadow of the West Brighton housing project,
where some of the 100 girls scurrying around the field in red, blue
and yellow pinnies live. ``I try to hit it with my head,'' she
adds, ``but it hurts after awhile.''
</P>
<P>
   Six of the Staten Island girls, none of whom had ever played
soccer before this week, are scheduled to carry a flag during
Saturday's opening ceremonies of the 1999 Women's World Cup at
Giants Stadium, at once symbolizing a milestone in the struggle for
gender equity in athletics and the challenges yet to come for the
nation's fastest-growing sport.
</P>
<P>
   While soccer, and the national women's team's extraordinary
success, has sent millions of girls onto the playing fields of
America over the last decade, it has thus far been mainly a
suburban craze. Now World Cup corporate sponsors are hoping to use
the enthusiasm of the tournament to turn city girls into devotees
of the game.
</P>
<P>
   In New York and the other six cities playing host to the
tournament, there are ``Urban Soccer Girl'' programs for girls who
live in housing projects, as well as soccer skills clinics like the
one that drew some 5,000 schoolchildren to Bryant Park in Manhattan
on Thursday. At the clinics, girls and boys alike learn to shoot,
pass, trap and head the ball, and are sent home with souvenir
photos of themselves dressed up as World Cup stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of nice to have a suburban activity inside the
city,'' said Stacey Fenley, a teacher at Public School 33 in
Manhattan who brought her first and second graders to Bryant Park.
``I don't hear a lot of our kids playing on soccer teams.
Hopefully, this will give them a spark.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past decade, soccer leagues have sprouted in American
suburbs as fast as subdivisions, with parents signing children up
as early as preschool, and adults playing well into middle age. Of
18 million registered soccer players in the United States, 7.5
million are women and girls, according to the Soccer Industry
Council of America.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer looks to be the great gender equalizer among youth
sports: as membership in one national league, the American Youth
Soccer Organization, has more than doubled to 607,000 over the past
dozen years, the percentage of girls has jumped from 25 percent to
40 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's amazing that the women get to play,'' said Dawn
Perry, 10, who was wearing her green Nigeria soccer jersey with No.
13 on the back as she practiced trapping at the Bryant Park
workshop. ``For so long, all we see is men playing positions. We
never see a girl on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Dawn, who lives in East Harlem and is in the fifth grade, used
to play in a league and would like to once again. The clinic
coaches said she was one of the few girls there who had playing
experience, and one called her a natural, even as the ball slipped
through her legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a girl, and I just love soccer,'' Dawn said. ``Maybe now
when I grow up I could be a soccer player in a World Cup. A Women's
World Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the success of women's soccer can be attributed to the
implementation over the past decade of Title IX, a federal law
mandating equity in school sports programs, and the rise in
prominence of women's sports generally, including the Women's
National Basketball Association, but experts say soccer also has
particular appeal to young girls. Height is not essential, strength
not as important as skill. It's a social game with low scores, and
thus less focus on the stars. It's cheap, requiring little
equipment commitment, and can be played anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about running around, it's not too violent, it's team
oriented and it's something they can play with their friends,''
said Marla Messing, president of the Women's World Cup organizing
committee. ``I think it's something girls feel they can own; this
is my sport. The other sports are so dominated by men; in the
United States, this is something they can really own.''
</P>
<P>
   While the WNBA had to sell itself to basketball fans used to
watching men play, women have had a prominent role in soccer's rise
in the United States practically from the beginning. Among men, the
United States is a relative novice at the world's most popular
sport; in contrast, soccer became popular among women here earlier
than in most other countries.
</P>
<P>
   The women's national team, unlike its male counterpart, is
really good: the United States won the first Women's World Cup in
1991, took third place in 1995 and won the gold medal during
women's soccer's debut at the 1996 Olympics and is favored in this
year's tournament. Mia Hamm is not America's best female soccer
player, she's America's best soccer player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought the women played better than the guys,'' said
Cait Kilpatrick, 9, who has been kicking since she was 4 years old
and has a poster of Hamm, her favorite player, hanging in her
family's home in Forest Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Cait, wearing shiny blue game shorts and white soccer jersey,
was kicking goal after goal at the shooting station in Bryant Park
in Manhattan on Thursday. She had come with her mother, a soccer
coach, and two older brothers, to volunteer at the clinic. They
will do the same thing at Giants Stadium Saturday morning, and then
watch the games it seems they have been waiting years for.
</P>
<P>
   ``The women should just play,'' Cait says. ``It doesn't matter
what the guys do.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Bryant Park clinic and the Staten Island camp, young
girls and teen-agers alike clustered around the ball like the
newest soccer players, refusing to stay in position. They lifted
their feet in hopes of planting them on top of the ball only to
watch it roll underneath. They tried to trap the ball with their
chests, but ended up using their arms _ off limits in the no-hands
game _ instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's boring, all you do is kicking,'' complained Joyce Jian,
11, a fifth grader at Public School 20 on the Lower East Side of
Manhattan, after she dribbled through the obstacle course and
tested her power shot at Bryant Park. ``My favorite activity is
volleyball. You can do it with your hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Cassandra Pena, 10, said she likes football, baseball and
kickball better, but when she got the ball through one of the holes
in the ``accuracy shot'' workshop for the third time, soccer was
starting to look pretty good.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boys always say, `You can't kick, you're not good,'''
Cassandra explained, even as she showed a whole crowd of children
that she can, indeed, kick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only some boys,'' piped in Victor Figueroa, 11.
</P>
<P>
   And the girls agreed.

   Upset after shooting a 75 in the opening round, Olazabal vented
his frustration after returning to his hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a splint, Olazabal arrived at the Pinehurst No. 2 course
to try a few practice swings. But he soon determined he could not
play, and left the course.
</P>
<P>
   The injury will keep Olazabal from playing for several weeks and
puts his status for the British Open, scheduled for July 15-18, in
doubt.

   ``I have a broken bone,'' Olazabal said. ``I hit a wall. It was
my fault.''

`BLACK TAX CREDIT' LANDS MAN IN A HEAP OF TROUBLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LAURA VOZZELLA 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The long and largely luckless campaign to
secure reparations for descendants of American slaves has a few
radicals who vow to win redress ``by any means necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   Willie Foster took a more moderate approach. He simply filled
out an IRS form, requested a $43,209 ``black tax'' credit and got a
check from the U.S. Treasury in the mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time they gave us something for that lost time in
slavery,'' said Foster, 35, a part-time minister from Fort Worth
who said his great-grandparents were slaves.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, there is no ``black tax credit,'' despite persistent
rumors to the contrary. The government goofed in 1996 when it paid
Foster $30,085.89 _ the amount he requested, minus about $13,000
owed for child support and student loans.
</P>
<P>
   Foster still has the money, but now his freedom is at stake. He
faces up to 15 years in prison for helping three friends apply for
the same tax credit _ one of the three got it _ after the Internal
Revenue Service told him there was no such thing.
</P>
<P>
   Foster is scheduled to be tried in Dallas federal court this
month on three counts of filing false claims.
</P>
<P>
   Talk of reparations has circulated since just after the Civil
War, when Congress voted to give freed slaves 40 acres and a mule.
But President Johnson killed the plan with a veto.
</P>
<P>
   The debate has bubbled up on and off ever since. U.S. Rep. John
Conyers, D-Mich., has tried unsuccessfully to introduce legislation
on the matter. A group called the National Coalition of Blacks for
Reparations in America is holding its 10th annual convention this
weekend in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   The debate landed in the lap of the IRS after L.G. Sherrod, a
New York journalist and economics consultant, wrote an essay in
``Essence'' in April 1993. Noting that the government has paid
reparations to Native Americans cheated out of lands and
Japanese-Americans interned during World War II, Sherrod urged
readers to use their tax forms to claim the modern-day equivalent
of 40 acres and a mule _ as calculated by The People's Institute
for Economics in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply enter $43,209 in `black taxes' and compute
accordingly,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   There was a flurry of filings that year and occasional waves
after that as Sherrod's suggested act of defiance morphed into
urban legend and the occasional con game. In 1996, Ben Badio, a
Liberian citizen living in Dallas, was sentenced to three years in
prison for charging almost 200 people $750 to $1,000 to fill out
tax forms claiming the ``credit.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just one of those myths that continues to resurface
across the country,'' said Phil Beasley, spokesman for the IRS in
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   The rumor apparently popped up in Fort Worth around tax time in
1996. Foster, who is a minister at Mount Olive Baptist Church in
Arlington and an investigator for a local branch of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, said he heard
about the black tax credit while applying for public assistance. He
said he inquired at a now-defunct tax preparation office, which
referred him to a local businesswoman he knew only as ``Miss
Ruby.''
</P>
<P>
   She told him to get IRS form 2439 _ Notice to Shareholder of
Undistributed Long-Term Capital Gains. In a box marked ``Regulated
investment company's name, address and ZIP code,'' he wrote,
``Black Taxes.'' In a box below that he wrote, ``$43,209.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was upfront. He wasn't trying to hide anything,'' said Doug
Greene, an assistant federal public defender representing Foster.
</P>
<P>
   After filing the form with the rest of his tax return in April
1996, Foster received six or seven letters from the IRS, adjusting
the amount of the tax credit because of outstanding student loans
and child-support payments, Greene said. None of those letters
called the credit itself into question, Greene said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They scrutinized it,'' Greene said. ``That's the killer.''
</P>
<P>
   Beasley said that he could not discuss the particulars of
Foster's case but that the IRS has inadvertently granted some bogus
tax credits.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the desire to provide good customer service and processing
the tax refunds as quickly as possible, sometimes money goes out to
people who don't deserve it,'' he said. ``But we usually catch it
later.''
</P>
<P>
   The IRS caught the mistake before the check actually made it to
Foster. In August 1996, Foster said, he received a telephone call
from a man identifying himself as an IRS agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `You will be receiving a tax refund check, and the
amount is wrong,' '' Foster said. ```Tell me where you live and
I'll pick up your check, and we'll send you a new one.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Foster said he didn't know whether to believe the man, so he
headed for the post office, found that the check had just been
delivered to his box, and deposited it in the bank. Foster said he
did not hear from the IRS again for two months.
</P>
<P>
   Then came an October letter stating that there is no black tax
credit and asking for the money back. Two more letters followed,
but those said he owed less than $300, according to documents in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was getting mixed signals,'' Greene said.
</P>
<P>
   Foster didn't send the money back. When the next tax season
rolled around, he agreed to help three co-workers who knew about
his windfall apply for the credit. He filled out their tax forms in
February 1997, not charging for his services. One of the three
received $2,300. The others received nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Foster's tax-credit help _ not the money he owes _ is what got
him indicted. The three men he helped will testify against him.
</P>
<P>
   Greene faults the government for seeking criminal prosecution
instead of seeking to recover the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's willing to pay the money back and has made that offer to
the IRS,'' Greene said. ``The IRS messed up by sending him the
money and must have been too embarrassed to go through their
regular collection method, so they thought they'd prosecute him.''
</P>
<P>
   Terri Moore, the assistant U.S. attorney handling the case,
could not be reached for comment Friday.

ABC AND UNION REACH TENTATIVE AGREEMENT ON CONTRACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NEIL MacFARQUHAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A tentative contract agreement was announced Friday
between ABC and the union representing hundreds of its camera
operators, editors and other technical staff members nationwide,
who have been involved in a protracted labor dispute that included
an 11-week lockout.
</P>
<P>
   The contract, which faces a ratification vote by July 16, awards
ABC far greater latitude in using temporary workers who do not
receive pension or health benefits. The temporary workers would,
however, be covered by the contract terms negotiated by the
National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians.
</P>
<P>
   The initial contract offer in February was rejected by most of
the 2,400 off-camera employees it covered. It would have increased
the number of temporary workers, now at 14 percent, to 26 percent
this year and 45 percent by 2002. The new contract raises those
numbers of temporary workers, known as daily hires, even higher,
allowing for 40 percent right away and 50 percent starting in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important to use daily hires _ it gives us more
flexibility,'' said Julie Hoover, a spokeswoman for ABC, noting
that the network wanted to use freelance staff for sports events,
news programs and other broadcasts that have changing needs for
camera operators, video editors and other technicians.
</P>
<P>
   She said the new contract mirrored those at other networks, with
NBC able to hire 50 percent of its technical staff on a freelance
basis and CBS able to hire without limits.
</P>
<P>
   The greater number of temporary workers at ABC would not
threaten the job security of existing members, said Tom Donahue, a
spokesman for the union, known as NABET, which is part of the
Communications Workers of America. ``The whole industry is
changing,'' he said. ``At least there is a 50 percent cap.''
</P>
<P>
   Donahue said new provisions that benefit members included
loosening the rules for when technical workers are eligible for
buyouts at ABC, which has gone through repeated waves of
downsizing.
</P>
<P>
   The new contract also increases the allowance for working
through lunch and specifies that those involved in the strike can
reclaim some vacation time. In addition, anyone working as a daily
hire for more than 20 days per year would be required to join the
union.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the provisions remain unchanged from the February offer:
the contract still provides for raises of about 13 percent over
four years, alters the health care plan and lowers the amount the
company contributes to workers' pensions.
</P>
<P>
   NABET claimed that even getting a contract after two years of
fighting constituted success. ``There is job security associated
with having a contract,'' Donahue said. ``We see that as the
largest gain.''
</P>
<P>
   An initial contract was rejected by engineering units in five
cities, including about 1,800 members. If those units in New York,
Washington, Chicago, San Francisco and Washington ratify the new
agreement, the other 600 employees in seven units of traffic
coordinators, publicity agents, telephone operators and others who
accepted the February contract would be covered by the new
provisions.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders are recommending ratification of the new contract,
which would expire March 31, 2003. Ms. Hoover said employees
covered by the contract with NABET earn on average $80,000 per
year, including overtime but not benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The union, whose members had been working without a contract
since March 1997, staged a one-day strike last November over
changes in the health benefits. The network responded with a
lockout, hiring part-time workers to fill the technical slots and
winning a ruling from the National Labor Relations Board that the
lockout was legal.

 &HT;    Pars precious as Duval, 2 others lead
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PINEHURST, N.C. _ It should be a typical U.S. Open weekend at
Pinehurst No. 2. The course that was defenseless 48 hours ago has
returned to its more famously fierce self. The score of par is
still to be treasured. The leaderboard possesses enough talent and
name recognition to delight television executives.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hear it for fairways and greens. There's a three-way tie
for the lead at 3-under-par 137 featuring Payne Stewart, who has a
U.S. Open trophy in his home, and young guns David Duval and Phil
Mickelson, who realize their careers will not be complete without a
major championship.
</P>
<P>
   There's more to the equation after 36 holes in the Sandhills.
Two strokes off the lead are Tiger Woods, Hal Sutton, PGA champion
Vijay Singh and Billy Mayfair. That's quite a representation from
the world rankings.
</P>
<P>
   With Pinehurst No. 2 drying out and drawing respect on a mild,
breezy, low-humidity day, only three players broke par, compared to
23 Thursday, when rain had softened the greens. Stewart, the 1991
champion, shot one of three 1-under-par 69s. The others came from
Jeff Maggert and John Huston, who are three shots off the pace at
140. Duval and Mickelson posted 70s and were darn proud of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt starting the day that 70 was going to be an exceptional
score because the winds were stronger and the greens weren't nearly
as soft,'' said Mickelson. ``I would have taken 70 at the start and
I'm very pleased with 70 at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who has never finished better than 18th in a U.S. Open,
stayed close with a 71. Sea Island's Davis Love III is six shots
back at 143 after a 73. Larry Mize of Columbus is seven back,
adding a 75 to his opening 69.
</P>
<P>
   Although Duval and Mickelson played together for a second day,
they downplayed any match-play situation. Both, however, bogeyed
the par-3 16th to eventually remain tied at 3-under. If not for a
double-bogey 5 at the par-3 6th hole, where he blasted over the
green from a bunker and missed a five-footer for par, Duval would
have been all alone at the top. He birdied the 7th and 8th holes
following the error.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad I had gotten enough under par before the sixth
hole,'' Duval said. ``I just wasn't quite as sharp today. I just
seemed to hit the ball off the tee to yardage where I was in
between clubs all day.''
</P>
<P>
   The cut came at 7-over-par 147, taking two-time champion Ernie
Els, who missed a 10-footer for birdie at the 18th and finished
8-over; Greg Norman (73-78_151); and 1998 Masters and British Open
champion Mark O'Meara (71-79_150). Defending champion Lee Janzen
chipped in at the 18th to make it on the number, shooting a 73.
</P>
<P>
   If Stewart can stay out of sand divots and keep away from any
circuslike USGA pin placements, maybe he can hang in all the way
this year. He led for three rounds at Olympic in 1998, only to
finish behind Janzen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm playing better than at the U.S. Open last
year,'' Stewart said. ``I feel I've got more control over my golf
game, over my swing. ... I could have crawled away and hid after
what happened last year or I could have built on what happened to
use it to strengthen myself, and that's the avenue I chose to
take.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Goydos, who spent much of the day around the lead, fell
apart on the back nine for a 74 and fell to 1-over 141.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson, reaffirming his pledge to leave the tournament if his
wife, Amy, goes into labor, said she had another visit with her
physician Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like it's still going to be another week and a
half,'' he said. ``I'm really not overly concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech players Matt Kuchar and Bryce Molder both failed to
make the cut. Kuchar shot a 79 to finish at 155, never threatening
a year after tying for 14th at the Olympic Club. Molder slipped on
the back nine for a 40, shooting 78 for 11-over.
</P>
<P>
   Former Georgia Tech player Stewart Cink of Duluth fought off a
severe cramp in his right side for a 74 and made the cut at 146.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could hardly swing,'' he said. ``I couldn't hardly hit the
ball straight, that's for sure. Good timing, huh?

EDITORIAL: RUSSIA'S MILITARY ROLE IN KOSOVO  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, June 19:
</P>
<P>
   Provided no new hitches develop, the weeklong crisis over
Russian participation in the NATO-led peacekeeping operation in
Kosovo now appears satisfactorily resolved. Negotiations between
top U.S. officials and their Russian counterparts have produced an
agreement that defines the zones where Russian troops will operate,
the channels through which they will report to NATO's commander and
their role at Pristina's airport.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden arrival of 200 Russian troops at that airport last
Friday was unnerving. But the talks that followed have been useful
and gave both sides what they needed. NATO blocked creation of a
separate, Russian-controlled sector that could have split Kosovo
into Serbian and ethnic Albanian zones and preserved overall
command of peacekeeping operations. Russia secured the respectful
treatment for its forces it needs to maintain domestic support for
joining in the NATO-led mission.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement provides that the Russian troops will operate
within the U.S., French and German sectors of Kosovo, plus
Pristina's airport in the British sector. With no separate Russian
sector, there will be no obvious geographic basis for partition.
Russian troops will serve under Russian commanders, who will in
turn report to the top NATO officers of their sectors. This
parallel structure allows Moscow to say that Russian troops are not
under direct NATO command, but leaves NATO fully in charge of all
peacekeeping forces. At the Pristina airport, the Russians will
share responsibility but British forces will direct air traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Potential problems include the possibility that Russian
soldiers, many of whom sympathize with the Serbs, might intimidate
returning Kosovar Albanians or tolerate Serbian violence. There is
also a risk that Russian officers might try to bypass NATO command
structures. That is essentially what happened last week when some
Russian troops broke off cooperation with NATO peacekeepers in
Bosnia and rushed to Pristina. Military relations between NATO and
Russia have been troubled in recent months. The agreement will only
work as planned if the Russians carry it out in good faith and
maintain professional discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Russia remains an important European power, and its role in
Kosovo should reflect that status. Regrettably, during most of
NATO's 11-week air campaign against Yugoslavia, Moscow stood
sullenly on the sidelines. But in the last weeks, constructive
Russian diplomacy was crucial to avoiding a bloody ground war and
securing a just peace. The participation of Russian troops, on the
terms now agreed, can strengthen that peace. &QL;

 &HT;    Waste pumped underground nears likely water supply in Fla.
 &HT;    By Robert P. King
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A half-mile beneath the earth, amid
boulders and pockets of salty water, Florida utilities have found a
perfect dumping place for their treated sewage.
</P>
<P>
   Injection wells pump as much as 400 million gallons of the stuff
underground each day _ never to be seen again, or so the theory
goes.
</P>
<P>
   But federal regulators are acknowledging what environmentalists
have argued for years: The waste is bubbling up into shallower
underground layers reserved for potential drinking water. The
evidence, seen at one north Palm Beach County site and others
around the state, includes ammonia appearing in test wells.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators could respond by stopping the injections. The U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency is also considering another
strategy: relaxing its rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mind-boggling,'' said Suzi Ruhl of the Legal
Environmental Assistance Foundation in Tallahassee, which has
fought for years to curb the pumping. ``Their solution to a known
violation is to change the law.''
</P>
<P>
   David Guest, an attorney for the Earthjustice Legal Defense
Fund, said changing the rules would be ``idiocy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not be putting contaminated waste underground and
then rolling the dice over whether we'll be drinking it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   No evidence
</P>
<P>
   Utility managers dismiss the issue as a technicality, saying no
proof exists that even a drop of waste has reached anyone's tap,
let alone made anyone ill. And that's out of hundreds of billions
of gallons that utilities have pumped during the past two decades
into a porous pocket 3,000 feet below ground.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, they say, any waste seeping upward would have to filter
through thousands of feet of fine sand, clay and limestone _ making
it cleaner than the water that nature placed there.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County Utilities Director Gary Dernlan warned that
alternatives wouldn't be cheap. He said customers' water bills
could rise 35 percent if the county had to cleanse the waste to
drinking-water quality before injecting it.
</P>
<P>
   Underground pumping also has let utilities sharply reduce
dumping into the Atlantic Ocean and other waterways.
</P>
<P>
   Ruhl countered that the seemingly cheap price of underground
injection deters utilities from more responsible strategies, such
as increased recycling or conservation. She said it also masks the
high cost of letting developers attract even more sewage-producing
households.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means you can grow and grow and grow and grow regardless of
the consequences,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A similar controversy may be awaiting the federal government's
$7.8 billion plan to restore the Everglades, which partly relies on
pumping more than a billion gallons of excess water underground
each day from Lake Okeechobee and other waterways.
</P>
<P>
   The Everglades proposal calls for temporarily storing the water
and later reusing it _ not getting rid of it forever. The stored
water wouldn't include treated sewage, and it would be about 1,000
feet to 2,000 feet shallower than the injected waste.
</P>
<P>
   Still, a key legal question is the same: Should the EPA relax
its rules prohibiting any potential contamination of underground
drinking water?
</P>
<P>
   On the treated sewage injections, the EPA has scheduled a
meeting next month in West Palm Beach to listen to ideas.
</P>
<P>
   One option is to let the utilities keep injecting, but only if
engineers prove that the waste would be clean by the time it
reaches drinking water supplies, EPA scientist Howard Beard said.
Another is to order the utilities to stop injecting.
</P>
<P>
   No other state allows utilities to pump their treated waste deep
underground, EPA engineer Nancy Marsh said.
</P>
<P>
   The method is based on the existence of the boulder zone, a
layer of porous rock at the lower depths of the Floridan Aquifer.
Thick mud, limestone and dolomite are supposed to separate the zone
from the aquifer's shallower regions, which serve as the state's
major water source.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was that the two would never meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found it just doesn't work for these wells in Florida,''
Beard said. But so far, he said, no evidence exists that the leaks
create a health threat. Beard said the rules protect much of the
aquifer as a drinking water source, even though a big swath of that
water is so salty that nobody is using it. Ruhl said the rules
protect water for future generations, not just what we're using
today.
</P>
<P>
   Telltale signs
</P>
<P>
   Of nearly 120 utility injection wells statewide, the EPA has
reports of waste residues escaping to the edge of potential
drinking water layers from 20 wells.
</P>
<P>
   Chemicals linked to waste residues are also showing up near a
Palm Beach County Utilities injection well near Boynton Beach,
although they're still hundreds of feet beneath any possible
drinking water supplies, Dernlan said. The telltale signs are
ammonia, which contains nitrogen, and fresh water. Dernlan said no
tests of county wells have shown signs of viruses or pathogens, but
Ruhl argued that nobody is testing thoroughly enough.
</P>
<P>
   Ruhl said the regulators' track record doesn't persuade her to
accept their assurances that the injections can be made safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have confidence in any more projections from
engineering studies,'' she said. ``And I certainly wouldn't let

QUESTIONS WILL BE ANSWERED AFTER GRANT FIGHTS SAVARESE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Pa., Texas)   By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Michael Grant is being marketed as this generation's
next heavyweight champion, and he certainly looks the part. Grant
is big and strong with a stiff jab, when he is inclined to use it.
He is a young, clean-cut man who sings and plays the piano for his
church choir in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   But there are still questions about Grant's capabilities. He
lacks the extensive amateur background that most world-class boxers
have. Grant took up the sport only six years ago after brief stints
playing basketball and football at two junior colleges in
California.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those questions, however, may be answered Saturday night
at the Theater in Madison Square Garden, where Grant (29-0) will
take on Lou Savarese (39-2), a tough native of the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   The bout will be broadcast on HBO's ``Boxing After Dark,''
beginning at 11 p.m. with a 10-round heavyweight match between
Jeremy Williams (31-1) and Maurice Harris (14-9-2).
</P>
<P>
   Savarese took George Foreman the distance before losing on a
decision and he displayed awesome power by knocking out Buster
Douglas with a crushing right to the chin.
</P>
<P>
   Savarese said that when he was walking into the Garden on
Wednesday for a news conference, a boxing fan told him he had to
stay away from Grant in the bout. ``I said, `Buddy, you haven't
seen me fight, have you?''' Savarese said.
</P>
<P>
   Savarese and Grant used to work out at the same Houston gym that
Evander Holyfield uses, so both fighters are familiar with each
other.
</P>
<P>
   ``Savarese is a coming-at-you kind of guy,'' Grant said. ``He
takes a good shot. He's not the kind of person to back up. He makes
you earn his respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Savarese hears all the talk about Grant being the future of the
heavyweight division.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm fighting a god with everyone saying he's the
next great heavyweight,'' Savarese said. ``We need to see more of
Mike. He's going to have to come out there and prove it to me and
make me respect him as a fighter.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant said: ``Maybe I will. All of my fights I have to show
everybody something.''
</P>
<P>
   Lennox Lewis, the World Boxing Council heavyweight champion, is
expected to be sitting at ringside Saturday night scouting Grant as
a possible next opponent should Lewis' proposed November rematch
with Holyfield fall through. Grant said he was not holding his
breath waiting for a title shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a season for everything,'' Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   On the undercard, Williams was set to fight Hasim Rahman, but
Rahman pulled out with a backache. That brought an incredulous
response from Kathy Duva of Main Events, the promoter of the bout.
``Rahman said he had a bad back and that's not surprising for
people who are spineless,'' Duva said.

 PAK FIRES A RECORD 63   FOR A ONE-SHOT LEAD  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ALEX YANNIS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABSECON, N.J. _ After accelerating to stardom last year as a
rookie on the Ladies Professional Golf Association tour, Se Ri Pak
has succumbed to pressure and fatigue in the early part of this
season.
</P>
<P>
   All the attention from government officials in her native South
Korea and from friends and family, along with the demands from
sponsors and the news media in North America, seemed to be too much
for the 21-year-old golfer who last year won four tournaments,
including two majors.
</P>
<P>
   This season it took Pak 16 rounds before she broke 70. She has
missed the cut three times and has seldom been in contention.
</P>
<P>
   But a few weeks ago her game started to come together. After
tying for fourth place last weekend in the Rochester International
for her best finish of the season, Pak returned to top form this
afternoon with a sizzling eight-under-par 63 in the opening round
of the ShopRite LPGA Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Pak was a shot ahead of Trish Johnson, who shot 64 on the
strength of eight birdies and a bogey. That score tied Johnson's
career-low round in 12 years on the LPGA tour, where she has three
victories, the last one in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The 63 by Pak, accomplished on 10 birdies and two bogeys on the
6,051-yard par-71 Bay Course of the Seaview Marriott Resort, set a
course and tournament record. The previous record of 64 was shared
by four players, including Karrie Webb of Australia last year.
</P>
<P>
   Pak, who changed irons after an opening-round 77 last week in
Rochester, shot a 66 on her first day with the new irons.
</P>
<P>
   With her parents listening during a post-round meeting with the
news media, Pak kept repeating how the presence of her father, Joon
Chul, had helped during the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was busy and didn't come until last week,'' Pak said.
``He checks my game better than anyone and he knows me better than
anyone. I'm also a lot happier now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golf is important, but my life is important, too. Whether I
win or not, I'm happy. I won tournaments in 1998, but I'm more
confident now.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak said she had started to trust her swing the last two weeks,
but the main reason for Friday's exceptional round was her putting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured the speed and I made every putt,'' Pak said. ``My
putting has been bad, but not today. Shooting eight under makes me
comfortable to defend next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak was alluding to playing in the McDonald's Championship, the
major that set off her string of victories that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sixty-three is a phenomenal round,'' said Juli Inkster, who
shot five-under 66 and was alone in third, three shots behind Pak.
``But I'll tell you what: I'll take two more five-unders and walk
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Inkster, who has won this tournament twice, in 1986 and 1988,
accomplished her 66 on six birdies and a bogey.
</P>
<P>
   At 67 were Kim Saiki, Shani Waugh, Charlotta Sorenstam, Sherri
Steinhauer, Wendy Ward and Leta Lindley.
</P>
<P>
   Betsy King shot a record 29 on the back nine for a 68 Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Annika Sorenstam, last year's winner, struggled to a one-over 72
under virtually ideal conditions.

 &HT;    Fla. governor's wife fined for customs breach
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A $19,000 shopping spree in Paris turned
into an expensive embarrassment for Florida's first lady Columba
Bush when she was detained by U.S. Customs agents Thursday for
failing to declare her purchases and was forced to pay a $4,100
fine.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's luggage was searched when she arrived at Atlanta's
Hartsfield Airport after a five-day trip to France. Gov. Jeb Bush
did not accompany his wife on the trip. The search was part of a
routine, random check of luggage made by U.S. Customs agents who
said they treated the first lady like any other overseas passenger.
</P>
<P>
   Born and raised in the Central Mexico town of Leon where she met
her husband when they were both teen-agers, Bush, 46, is a seasoned
overseas traveler. On the campaign trail, she always wore
well-tailored clothes and modest jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   After opening her bags, Customs agents found clothing and
jewelry worth $19,000 that was bought during her trip. She
immediately wrote a personal check for the $4,100 fine. The fine
was three times what she would have paid if she had reported the
merchandise to customs.
</P>
<P>
   After paying the fine, Bush returned to Tallahassee on Thursday
night. When word of her troubles in Atlanta got out Friday, the
governor's office issued a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly regret this unfortunate mistake,'' she said. ``I am
sorry for exercising bad judgment and can assure everyone this will
never happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, Gov. Bush had just eight words to say about the
episode. ``Both Columba and I deeply regret this mistake.''

NETWORK MAKES TENTATIVE DEAL WITH TECHNICIANS IT LOCKED OUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The ABC network announced Friday it has reached a
tentative, four-year deal with negotiators for the 2,400 unionized
technicians it locked out for 11 weeks last fall and winter.
</P>
<P>
   The pact, which must be ratified by employees, ends more than
two years of working without a contract for camera operators,
producers and other behind-the-scenes workers represented by the
National Association of Broadcast Employees and Technicians. About
600 of the affected employees work in the Los Angeles area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're recommending ratification even though the tentative
contract falls short of our objectives, because we believe it's the
best agreement that can be achieved at this time,'' said NABET
negotiator John Krieger. Results of the vote are expected to be
released July 16.
</P>
<P>
   The pact provides for a 3.5 percent salary increase, retroactive
to June 26, 3 percent increases for each of the next two years and
a 3.5 percent increase in the final year through March 31, 2003.
The union said the agreement also improves contract provisions
covering vacation, discharges and the hiring of daily workers.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, owned by The Walt Disney Co., locked out NABET members in
November after the union staged a one-day strike to protest the
network's imposition of reduced health benefits. The walkout
disrupted live telecasts by ABC, which barred the employees from
returning to work unless it gave the network 72 hours' notice of
future job actions.
</P>
<P>
   During the lockout, ABC used temporary workers while NABET
members picketed network facilities, and prominent Democrats and
entertainers refused to be interviewed for shows like ``Good
Morning America,'' ``Nightline'' and ``This Week.''
</P>
<P>
   Five units turned down a network proposal in December, but the
union returned to work in January after agreeing to give advance
warning of future strikes in exchange for obtaining binding
arbitration on dismissals of several members.
</P>
<P>
   Tentative agreements will be submitted to the 1,400 members of
NABET units in Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and
Washington, D.C., that turned down ABC's December proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Upon ratification, the new contracts will become part of the
master agreement between ABC and NABET and cover seven smaller
units, which ratified the package in February.

CHASE CHASING VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH LAIR  
 c.1999 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRWINDALE, Calif. _ Mike Chase says that if he cannot win,
there's no sense racing. It's why the current NASCAR Winston West
series leader let others do the racing the past two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched the grass grow,'' the 47-year-old said of those
years. ``If I can't win, I don't want to drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very frustrating. I was trying everything I could do to
get into Winston Cup. I was looking at different deals. But if
you're not famous, the finger is always pointed at the driver if
you don't do well. I didn't want to go out and not be able to
qualify and have to hope to get a provisional (starting
position).''
</P>
<P>
   Chase hasn't won a race this season, but when the series moves
to Irwindale Speedway tonight for the Irwindale 250, the former
Northern Californian knows his team has at least a chance. He has a
second-place finish (Phoenix), two fifths and two sixths. His worst
finish was on Memorial Day, when he completed only 98 of 200 laps
at Mesa Marin Raceway in Bakersfield and finished 19th.
</P>
<P>
   He holds a six-point lead over Sean Woodside and Brandon Ash and
is nine points ahead of fourth-place Austin Cameron.
</P>
<P>
   Being up front is a feeling he hasn't had since he won the
series title in 1994. Chase won four NWWS events that year and
placed in the top 10 in 10 of 14 races. He also moved to Concord,
N.C., to be closer NASCAR action, a move he says was to further his
career.
</P>
<P>
   He returned to NWWS in '95 but ran only seven races, winning
two. Instead, he concentrated on the inaugural NASCAR Craftsman
Truck series. He placed 30th in that season and 35th the year
after, running half of each schedule. He was never among the top 10
in any of the races in the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went and drove for a team without the finances,'' Chase
admitted. ``It was probably a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase decided he wasn't going to let it happen again. Car owner
Gene Christensen offered him a chance to return to the NWWS this
season. His top-five finishes have convinced other series owners to
take a look at him again.
</P>
<P>
   ``They see you on TV and it definitely opens a lot of people's
eyes,'' he said. ``The phone has been ringing off the hook. People
are asking, `Where have you been?'''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had an offer to race in last Friday's Trucks race at
Texas Speedway in Fort Worth. He turned it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a position which I felt I could win and I didn't
feel comfortable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Chase thinks that another ride could be in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get into a situation where it's not the right
combination and you know you can't do your job. When that happens,
the first thing they do is replace the driver or the crew chief.''
</P>
<P>
   Chase says the position he's in now is perfect, at least for
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if Greg Christensen wanted for me to drive it the
first year to set it up for him for next year. All I know is that I
want to win and not ride.''

USC'S MUNSON SIGNS WITH TIGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ His first swings as a professional baseball player
were in the batting cage at Tiger Stadium, his first paycheck is
the amount of money normally won by a lottery winner, and he gets
to hang out this weekend with his best friend Eric Chavez, who
happens to be the third baseman for the Oakland A's.
</P>
<P>
   The spoils are going to Eric Munson.
</P>
<P>
   Munson, a junior catcher who led USC to a national championship
in 1998, signed with Detroit on Friday, two weeks after the Tigers
made him the No.3 pick in the major-league draft.
</P>
<P>
   Munson agreed to a four-year major-league contract worth $6.75
million. His signing bonus is $3.5 million and he will get $250,000
this season. He'll earn $750,000 next year, $1 million in 2001 and
$1.25 million in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't be more excited to be here,'' Munson, 21, told the
Detroit Free Press. ``It's a class organization.... I'm kind of in
awe seeing this old stadium. I'm looking forward to seeing Comerica
Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Moorad, Munson's Newport Beach-based adviser whose clients
include Pat Burrell, last year's No.1 overall pick, and Arizona
first baseman Travis Lee, negotiated the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Because his contract is with the Tigers, Munson's major-league
service time begins immediately and he will receive his paychecks
directly from the Tigers, even while he plays this season in the
minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Munson will stay in Detroit through Monday, working out with the
Tigers. By coincidence, Oakland's Chavez _ his best friend since
they were 4 years old _ also will be in town those four days with
the Athletics. The two planned to have dinner Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thrilled that it's worked out that way,'' Munson said.
``We've always dreamed to be on a big-league field, and doing it
together, it's a great time.''
</P>
<P>
   Munson will report to the Tigers' Single-A team in Lakeland,
Fla., next week, then will join West Michigan in the Single-A
Midwest League.
</P>
<P>
   Munson, 21, batted .346 with 15 home runs and 41 RBI this
season. He missed 21 games with a broken right hand.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: WHAT TO DO IF YOUR COMPANY IS OVERVALUED  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By FLOYD NORRIS  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Imagine yourself in the following position:
</P>
<P>
   You've started a company and begun to build it, with a story
that has captured the imagination of Wall Street. You've sold stock
to the public and seen it rise much further than seemed possible.
You suspect that one of these days investors will wise up and the
share price will plunge.
</P>
<P>
   What should you do?
</P>
<P>
   First, take profits by selling some of your shares at high
prices. Then use the company's overvalued stock to buy assets that
are relatively cheap. You do that by offering stock to acquire
companies that Wall Street does not love but that would raise the
value of your company.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good strategy, but it has one flaw. When Wall Street sees
what you are doing, it may not like it. After all, it doesn't agree
with the basic premise, that your stock is overvalued.
</P>
<P>
   That scenario, it appears to me, is now playing itself out as
two telecommunications wunderkinds bid against each other for the
same telephone companies. The targets have something the bidders
need _ real, live customers.
</P>
<P>
   Bidder No. 1 is Global Crossing. Founded only two years ago by
Gary Winnick, once a colleague of Michael Milken at Drexel Burnham
Lambert, it went public 10 months ago and by early May was trading
for almost seven times the offering price from last summer. It has
installed a new fiber-optic cable under the Atlantic and is
building cables in other parts of the world. It rents capacity on
its system to other phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   Bidder No. 2 is Qwest Communications, which has almost completed
an 18,500-mile fiber-optic network covering most of the United
States. It also rents out capacity to phone companies, but through
acquisitions it now has four million customers who deal directly
with it. It was started in 1994 by Philip Anschutz, an oil and
railroad magnate, and went public two years ago. At its peak this
spring, it was trading at nearly 10 times its original offering
price.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies are trying to buy U.S. West, the Baby Bell based
in Denver, and the Frontier Corporation of Rochester, N.Y., which
operates a local phone company and a long-distance system. Global
Crossing was there first, reaching deals with both companies, while
Qwest has entered with hostile bids.
</P>
<P>
   Both Winnick and Anschutz have arranged to take out big profits
by selling stock in their own companies at prices that prevailed
before they got into this bidding war. Now they are trying to merge
with U.S. West and Frontier to get 30 million customers.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street has been dubious about companies like U.S. West,
fearing that much of their capacity is outmoded and that they will
face increasing competition. That led to the shares of Global
Crossing and Qwest falling when they got into this battle. But this
is a case where the bidders know what they are doing. Eventually
there will be more than enough fiber-optic capacity, and prices for
it will fall. So long as they are selling capacity to other phone
companies, Global Crossing and Qwest face the possibility of seeing
their revenues slide when that happens.
</P>
<P>
   But the lesson of telecommunication wars to date has been that
retail customers are slow to move. All the long-distance companies
have customers who pay more than they would have to if they just
asked their current carrier for the best plan available. Both
Global Crossing and Qwest need customers, and they need to get them
before investors realize how great the need really is.
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy to determine which of the two bids is better, for
that calculation revolves around such issues as which one of the
companies would be better at managing the combined entity and which
of them is offering less-overvalued stock.
</P>
<P>
   But shareholders in U.S. West and Frontier don't have to decide
that. With the stock prices of both companies having risen because
of the bidding war, they should sell now and consider putting the
money into other companies with customers _ the commodity that is
on the way to becoming more valuable than fiber-optic cables.

 &HT;    Witches seek `tolerance and understanding' in ritual
 &HT;    By Kim Sue Lia Perkes
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KILLEEN, Texas _ Witches burning herbs in a black, cast-iron
cauldron may seem something out of folklore, but on Friday night a
group of Wiccans did just that in a ritual to promote tolerance for
their unconventional religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the magic for tonight?'' High Priestess Tama Oringderff
asked the 16 witches assembled on a farm near Fort Hood.
``Tolerance and understanding'' the Wiccans replied in unison.
</P>
<P>
   Oringderff, a leader of the Sacred Well Congregation of San
Antonio, said the smoke from parsley, for cleansing negative words
said about them, sage and rosemary to create ``insightful and
loving dialogue from the heart,'' and fennel to ``soothe the
stomach from the pain of destructive deeds'' held the energy of
tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope these herbs will carry our message to the world for
tolerance, understanding, peace and harmony,'' Oringderff said as
she bent over the burning herbs.
</P>
<P>
   The ritual, the witches said, was an effort to counter
intolerance from religious conservatives who are trying to ban
their faith from the military.
</P>
<P>
   The Sacred Well sponsors the Fort Hood Open Circle, a collection
of active and retired military personnel who practice their faith
on the Army post.
</P>
<P>
   Since an Austin American-Statesman article last month about Fort
Hood sanctioning Wicca by providing space for witchcraft rituals, a
Georgia congressman has demanded that the practice be halted and
has proposed legislation to forbid it. Also, several conservative
religious groups have called for a nationwide recruitment boycott
of the Army until Wiccan rituals are banned from military
installations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we needed to do something,'' said High Priest David
Oringderff, who founded the Sacred Well.
</P>
<P>
   During the ritual, the retired Army major told the witches, ``We
should be grateful for the Constitution and grateful for the
military that defends it. To the best of my knowledge, the U.S.
Army is the first army in history never to have bloodied its sword
in the cause of a sectarian religion.''
</P>
<P>
   The witches said they hope the ritual, the equivalent of a
prayer service, helps bring a change of heart to U.S. Rep. Bob Barr
(R-Ga.) and the Washington-based Free Congress Foundation that is
leading the charge for the Army boycott. Bill Murray of the
Religious Freedom Coalition in Washington, one of the groups
supporting the boycott, said limits must be placed on the conduct
of people in the military.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wicca, unlike Christianity and Judaism, prescribes no personal
limits of behavior ... it teaches that each individual must
determine his patterns of behavior and may use the gods of Wicca to
obtain any personal goal,'' Murray said. ``An Army based on Wicca
would be willing to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Fort Hood sanctioned Wicca _ a nature-based religion with roots
in pre-Christian Europe _ three years ago. Wiccan groups are now
springing up on military bases worldwide.

 &HT;    Fla. first lady detained at Atlanta airport
 &HT;    By Mike Williams
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Florida Gov. Jeb Bush's wife, Columba, was detained at
Atlanta's Hartsfield International Airport and ordered to pay
$4,100 in penalties for failing to declare items she had purchased
on an overseas trip, U.S. Customs Service officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was detained and treated just like anybody else,'' said
customs spokesman Bill Anthony in Washington. ``It was for not
declaring legal merchandise. It's not a unique situation with
people coming back from overseas.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida's first lady was not incarcerated, although the
incident, which happened Thursday, is considered a violation of
customs law, he said. Columba Bush spent about 3 1/2 hours at the
Atlanta airport and missed a connecting flight, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office issued a statement Friday evening
acknowledging the incident and saying Columba Bush paid a civil
penalty of $4,100 by personal check. The statement said the penalty
represented three times the duty that would have been assessed on
the merchandise purchased in France, mostly clothing and jewelry,
valued at $19,000.
</P>
<P>
   The governor's office quoted Columba Bush as saying, ``I truly
regret this unfortunate mistake. I am sorry for exercising bad
judgment and can assure everyone this will never happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeb Bush, elected in November, is the son of former President
George Bush and younger brother of Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the
current front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Bush met his wife in her native Mexico when he was an exchange
student from Phillips Academy at Andover, a prestigious New England
prep school. The couple courted by mail and on Bush's return visits
for several years before marrying in the early 1970s. They have
three children between the ages of 15 and 22. According to
published reports, Columba Bush is a stylish dresser who has
frequented expensive boutiques in Bal Harbour, an upscale Miami
suburb. She is a devout Catholic, is active in a Dade County drug
abuse education group and has raised money for the Ballet
Folklorico of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Customs officials in Atlanta said officers, during a routine
inspection of her luggage, found more items than she had reported
on her customs form.
</P>
<P>
   Customs allows people to bring $400 worth of merchandise into
the country, but anything over that amount must be reported for the
purpose of assessing duty on the merchandise, Anthony said.

EDITORIAL: HELPING THE DISABLED WORK  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, June 19:
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a piece of legislation makes such obvious good sense
that it commands support from all points on the political spectrum.
That happened on Wednesday when the Senate voted 99-0 to pass the
Work Incentives Improvement Act to allow disabled Americans to work
without fear of losing health coverage under Medicare and Medicaid.
The legislation would at last end the perverse financial
disincentives in disability law that prevent people from becoming
self-sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   More than 7.5 million disabled Americans receive federal
benefits through Social Security Disability Insurance and
Supplemental Security Income. Many may want to work, but less than
one-half of 1 percent receiving disability insurance do because
they would lose their cash benefits if they earned more than $500 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, they would lose their health coverage after three years.
The new act _ sponsored by James Jeffords and William Roth, both
Republicans, and the Democrats Edward Kennedy and Daniel Patrick
Moynihan _ would allow the disabled to keep their Medicare benefits
when they return to work, and also create a system under which cash
benefits would gradually diminish as earnings rose.
</P>
<P>
   The House should move on this legislation quickly. If only 1
percent of the disabled receiving federal benefits _ or 75,000
people _ were to work, the government would save an estimated $3.5
billion in disability payments over the lifetime of the
beneficiaries. That kind of return makes this program fiscally
smart as well as compassionate.

EDITORIAL: MS. BROWNER RESPONDS ON CLEAN AIR  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, June 19:
</P>
<P>
   Carol Browner, administrator of the Environmental Protection
Agency, has unveiled a rejiggered plan to improve air quality in
the Northeastern United States. This will benefit residents in
places like New York and New Jersey, which have long suffered from
dirty air blowing in from the South and Midwest. It also sends a
strong message that the administration is not yet prepared to let
two conservative federal judges rewrite its clean air strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The judges are Douglas Ginsburg and David Williams, Reagan
appointees who dominated two court rulings last month by separate
three-judge panels of the 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals. The first
ruling, on dubious constitutional grounds, overturned tough air
quality standards imposed in 1997 for air and soot _ the
cornerstone of the administration's clean air policies.
</P>
<P>
   The second suspended Ms. Browner's subsequent order requiring 22
states and the District of Columbia to submit detailed plans for
reducing emissions of nitrogen oxide, the main ingredient in smog,
that is blown eastward by prevailing winds from Midwestern power
plants and industrial boilers. The 22-state order had been based on
the new air quality standards that the court had just invalidated.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Browner had one weapon in reserve. Two years ago, before
the 22-state plan was devised, several Northeastern states filed
individual petitions based on older, less stringent air quality
standards than those rejected by the Second Circuit. The states had
said that no matter what they did within their own borders, they
could not meet the older smog standards because too much pollution
blew in from other states. In effect, what Ms. Browner has now
decided to do is resurrect those petitions and use them to impose
at least some controls on out-of-state polluters.
</P>
<P>
   This backup strategy will apply to only 12 polluting states
named in the petitions, and will therefore provide less relief to
Northeastern residents than the 22-state plan. To obtain broader
relief, Ms. Browner and the Justice Department must eventually
persuade the Supreme Court to overturn the Second Circuit's ruling
tossing out the new smog and soot standards.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is a modest first step that has a good chance of
surviving legal challenge, since it is based on old standards that
remain in force. It also reassures anyone interested in cleaner air
that Ginsburg and Williams are not the only people calling the
shots in Washington.

 &HT;    Ride recalls Mississippi slayings
 &HT;    By Erik Rodriguez
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A new generation of freedom riders rolled through
Atlanta on Friday night to commemorate three men who were murdered
working to challenge segregation laws in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Freedom Ride 1999, sponsored by the New York-based Chaney
Goodman Unity Coalition, seeks to honor the lives of freedom riders
James Earl Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner. The three
men were murdered in Mississippi while working to secure voting
rights for blacks in the South in 1964.
</P>
<P>
   The charter bus trip, which began in New York City, also aims to
bring people together to voice opinions on congressional issues,
such as nondiscriminatory employment practices and domestic and
workplace violence.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 participants stopped for dinner and services at
Temple Emanu-El of Greater Atlanta on Friday night as their buses
swept through Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was Allan Gould, a Toronto writer who said that 35
years ago, he was on the bus behind the one carrying Chaney as
their caravan headed south.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mississippi was in flames,'' recalled Gould, who is in his
50s. ``People were afraid to register to vote. It was horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Greer, a 25-year-old student from Philadelphia, said the
civil rights issues facing young people today differ from those
that cost the three civil rights workers their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't compare, because we're not risking anything,'' said
Greer. ``But everyone here is an activist and we're just trying to
get them to do more when they get home.''
</P>
<P>
   During Friday evening's observances, Antonio Pryce of Hyde
Point, N.C., began to sing an old spiritual that began with the
words: ''I woke up this morning with my mind stayed on freedom.''
One by one, people joined in, until the room was filled with
singing and clapping.
</P>
<P>
   The caravan, which also stopped in Washington, D.C. and
Greensboro, N.C., will leave Atlanta today. It will pass through
historic sites in Selma, Birmingham and Montgomery, Ala., before
ending the ride Monday with a dedication at Chaney's gravesite in
Meridian, Miss. It will mark the 35th anniversary of the murders.
</P>
<P>
   Chaney was 21 years old when he, Schwerner and Goodman were
killed by a mob after being detained by the Neshoba County
Sheriff's Department in Philadelphia, Miss. They were found six
weeks later, buried beneath a nearby dam, ending a nationwide
search.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 ride is important to help people remember the
sacrifices made by the three men, organizers of the event said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are beginning to have an actual sense of what it was
like to be in the actual freedom rides in the 1960s, when those
folks put their lives on the line,'' said Katwy Heru, director of
operations for the Unity Coalition, which is run by Chaney's
younger brother, Ben. ``They also (are getting) an understanding of
the history that they are participating in.

AGREEMENT REACHED ON DEPLOYMENT OF RUSSIAN TROOPS IN KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to add 8   grafs following optional-trim marker. No other

 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELSINKI, Finland _ Russia and the United States, ending three
days of grueling negotiations, Friday signed a military agreement
that integrates Russia into the Kosovo peacekeeping force, dividing
the bulk of 3,600 Russian troops among three of five sectors led by
NATO countries.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement broke a tense stalemate over Russia's role in
Kosovo, and opened the way for restoration of Russia's links to the
Western alliance, which Moscow froze last March when NATO launched
airstrikes against Yugoslavia, its historical ally in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our agreement recognizes the stakes that Russia and NATO share
in Europe's future,'' said Secretary of Defense William Cohen at
signing ceremonies held late Friday at Finland's presidential
palace. ``It also shows that the U.S. and Russia can work together
on important security issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The talks here began at a low point in U.S.-Russian relations,
which have been scarred by the conflict in Yugoslavia and again
last week by Moscow's sudden decision to preempt NATO by
dispatching 200 Russian paratroopers to the Kosovo capital of
Pristina.
</P>
<P>
   Control over the airport is to be shared: Russian commanders
will be in charge of ground operations, while NATO will oversee air
traffic control. Under a tightly set schedule for reopening the
airfield, clearance for the arrival of six Russian planes is
expected to be given within the next week.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-won success was seen as an important sign that both
sides are eager to capitalize on Russia's critical role in the
Kosovo peace talks, and to resume a relationship that is seen as
key to Europe's security. ``The significance of this agreement goes
beyond Kosovo, as important as that is,'' Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright said Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   By agreeing to a distribution of Russian troops in sectors of
Kosovo controlled by France, Germany and the United States, Russian
negotiators stepped back from an initial demand for a separate
Russian sector in the Serbian province. That demand had been
reinforced by President Boris Yeltsin, who said in Moscow on
Thursday that he had instructed his top envoy to the talks, Defense
Minister Igor Sergeyev, to stand fast on Russia's insistence for a
sector of its own.
</P>
<P>
   But at the signing ceremonies, Sergeyev and Russian foreign
minister Igor Ivanov said the compromise arrangement, thrashed out
during 33 hours of negotiation and laid out in exhaustive detail in
the final document, had met Yeltsin's requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found an alternative solution which will assure such kind
of deployment that will enable Russian troops to actively
participate in the peacekeeping operation,'' Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the agreement carried out Yeltsin's instructions,
Ivanov gave a curt reply. ``If it did not correspond to the
president's instructions, Sergeyev would not have signed,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   From the start of the talks American negotiators, acting on
behalf of their NATO allies, said they would not yield on certain
principles _ or ``red lines'' _ which included the preservation of
a unified command structure for the NATO-led force in Kosovo, and a
refusal to grant Russia a sector of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Russia, for its part, had said it would not put its troops under
NATO command, or follow arrangements now in place for the shared
command of 1,300 Russian soldiers deployed as part of an
international peacekeeping force in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   According to a senior Defense Department official, the command
arrangement included in the agreement would give Russian commanders
a greater say in the Kosovo peacekeeping operations, at all levels.
``There is an important distinction from the Bosnia arrangement,''
he said. ``Under this arrangement, the Russian role is more
intensive, more integrated and the participation is greater.''
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the agreement calls for a 10-member Russian
military delegation to NATO's military headquarters, three Russian
officers posted at NATO's southern command headquarters in Naples,
Italy, and Russian commanders assigned to the NATO-led peacekeeping
forces in the three sectors where their troops will serve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russian troops will be under the tactical command of KFOR,''
said Cohen Friday night, referring to the Kosovo peacekeeping
force. ``But in operational terms, political and military, they
will be answerable to the national command authority of Russia.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the senior Defense Department official, the
agreement also gives Russian forces the right to refuse to
participate in certain operations as long as they recognize that
other forces may move in and carry out the disputed tasks. He said
the Russians were reassured that similar conditions have been
imposed on other national forces participating in the Kosovo
peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
   In NATO's view, a separate Russian sector would have resulted in
a de facto partition of Kosovo, with the Serbian population
withdrawing to the area under Russian protection, and Kosovo
Albanians dominant in the five NATO sectors, controlled by Italy,
Britain, France, Germany and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials are also concerned that the Russians, left in
control of a large patch of territory, would pull away from the
unified command structure that is considered essential to an
effective peacekeeping operation.
</P>
<P>
   A Clinton administration official in Washington said of the
arrangement: ``It works the same way for American troops _ or those
of any other nationality _ operating under an overall NATO command.
All NATO troops are under national command, but NATO has overall
command of the mission and tactical control over those forces.''
</P>
<P>
   And President Clinton, who was in Cologne, said the arrangement
may help assure Serbs that they can stay in Kosovo. ``We think it
will give confidence to them if the Russians are in more than one
sector,'' he said.

 HELSINKI: sector,'' he said.

<P>
   NATO's reluctance to permit Russia a separate role has to do
with doubts about Moscow's reliability as a military partner. ``It
has to do with something that is not so pleasant to talk about,
which is trust,'' said one American at the talks.
</P>
<P>
   The deployment of Russian paratroopers at the Pristina airport
last week _ ordered as Russian diplomats were assuring the
Americans that no such order had been given _ damaged Russia's
credibility in the West. But in Moscow the move was seen as a
tactical triumph.
</P>
<P>
   Reinforcements for the 200 paratroopers never arrived because
countries neighboring Yugoslavia denied Russia permission to fly
over troop transport planes until there was an agreement with NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian soldiers, supplied with food brought on convoys from
Bosnia, have spent the last week in tenuous isolation, depending on
British troops for water.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement Friday allows for up to 750 Russian troops to be
stationed at the airport, with five battalions _ or 2,850 troops _
to be distributed among the French, German and American sectors.
According to a map distributed Friday night, the Russians will be
assigned zones within the sectors. The Russian zone within the
American sector will be located in Kosovo's northeastern corner.
</P>
<P>
   According to a senior State Department official, the Russian
zones were allocated in areas where both Serbs and Albanians live,
in order to dispel any notion of ethnic division. He said Russian
negotiators expressed concern about the reaction of the Albanians
to Russian troops, but were given assurances that NATO plans to
press ahead with the disarming of Albanian militants.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of the command structure was resolved on the first day
and by Thursday the work shifted to expert military groups,
interspersed with meetings between Cohen and Sergeyev, and Albright
and Ivanov.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement now goes to the North Atlantic Council, where NATO
allies are expected to approve it. Yeltsin, who was also consulted,
is expected to endorse the agreement when he meets Clinton in
Cologne.

BOEING STRIKES UNUSUAL DEAL TO BUY AIRBUS PLANES FROM CARRIER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The Boeing Co. has raised the level of competition in
its battle with archrival Airbus Industrie.
</P>
<P>
   In a bold move that industry analysts said aims to blunt the
momentum of Airbus with Asia's most profitable airline, the
Seattle-based aerospace giant said Friday it will buy 17 Airbus
widebody planes from Singapore Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual deal includes two planes that likely aren't built
yet; they haven't even been delivered by the European planemaker.
</P>
<P>
   In return, Singapore Airlines will convert options from a
previous order and buy 10 new 777s worth nearly $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal's significance is that it once again gives Boeing
the upper hand over Airbus with a crucial Asian airline _ one of
Boeing's best customers for the 777, according to Paul Nisbet,
aerospace analyst with JSA Research Inc.
</P>
<P>
   And if more Asian carriers opt for the 777 over Airbus' planes,
it could also have implications for a proposed new, longer-range
version of the big wide-body Boeing jet that had been postponed
when Singapore opted for big, new Airbus jets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This certainly raises the level of competition,'' Nisbet said.
``It swings the potential market share a little in Boeing's
direction.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not unprecedented for Boeing, as part of an order
transaction, to buy and remarket an Airbus plane acquired from an
airline. But a Boeing spokesman said this is far and away the most
Airbus planes the company has ever bought at one time.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came at the end of the Paris air show, and for
Boeing it capped what has been a good week with a parting shot at
its European rival.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesman Mark Hooper said Boeing will buy Singapore's existing
fleet of 15 Airbus A340-300 aircraft. In addition, he said, Boeing
will buy two A340-300s that are to be delivered to Singapore
Airlines in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Neither company would disclose what Boeing is paying for the
Airbus planes, but a new A340-300's list price is $140 million to
$145 million, depending on the configuration.
</P>
<P>
   The 10 options being exercised are part of a $12.7 billion order
placed by Singapore Airlines in 1995 for 77 of Boeing's 777s. Of
those, 34 were firm orders. The dollar value of the order,
including options, was Boeing's biggest ever.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the 1995 contract, Singapore Airlines had the option
to sell its fleet of A340-300s to Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   The latest 777s are scheduled for delivery between 2001 and
2004.
</P>
<P>
   Singapore Airlines said it expected to finance the latest
purchase largely through cash flow but it would resort to borrowing
or leasing if needed. The carrier, Asia's most profitable, has 89
aircraft in its fleet. It expects to have a fleet of 120 aircraft
by the end of the financial year 2004.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the airline may have decided to go with the 777 over
the Airbus planes is a recent proposal by the Federal Aviation
Administration to relax a rule known as ETOPS, (extended range
twin-engined operations). Under present ETOPS rules, a twin-engine
plane such as the 777 is limited on its route to 180 minutes from
an emergency airport. Because the A340-300 is a four-engine plane,
it is under no such restriction.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA recently proposed a 15 percent extension of ETOPS to 207
minutes. That extension would open more routes to the 777.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing, of course, is in favor of the extension, as are U.S.
airlines that fly the 777. Airbus has opposed the extension,
arguing a twin-engine plane is not as safe as a four-engine plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Singapore Airlines is obviously expecting ETOPS to be relaxed,
as well it should be,'' said Nisbet.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear what the development may ultimately mean for the
10 A340-500 planes ordered by Singapore Airlines last year. Hooper,
the Boeing spokesman, said the agreement by Boeing to buy the
A340-300s has nothing to do with the A340-500s.
</P>
<P>
   The A340-500 order last year was an important Airbus victory
over Boeing, which was counting on Singapore Airlines as a launch
customer for the 777X, a longer range version of the present 777.
</P>
<P>
   The A340-500 is a 313-seat plane that will be able to fly nearly
10,000 miles, further than any other plane now in production.
Singapore Airlines plans to use the plane to fly non-stop from
Singapore to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's 777X would have longer range than current 777 models.
</P>
<P>
   Because Singapore Airlines only ordered 10 of the A340-500s,
industry analysts speculated at the time that the Boeing's 777X
might still be in the running before the airline completes its
long-range fleet.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known when Boeing will launch the 777X. But engine
makers have already submitted bids to Boeing to supply the monster
engines that will be needed to power the huge new plane.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Boeing must now find buyers for 17 Airbus planes.
</P>
<P>
   Nisbet said Boeing should have no problem remarketing the
planes, since it likely got a steep discount from Singapore
Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will certainly be airlines out there figuring they can
get these planes on the cheap,'' he said. ``I expect Boeing to
dispose of them fairly rapidly.''

BUSH SIGNS BILL BANNING ANTI-GUN LAWSUITS

   HOUSTON _ Gov. George W. Bush on Friday signed into law a bill
making it illegal for any of the state's cities or other local
governments to file suit against gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   The move lands Bush, the Republican presidential front-runner,
in the middle of what is emerging as a hot-button debate in the
2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush does not believe the manufacturer of a legal product
should be held responsible for the criminal use of that product,''
said Linda Edwards, the governor's director of communications.
``This legislation seeks to curb frivolous lawsuits.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's signing of the bill prompted Vice President Al Gore to
take direct aim at his potential presidential opponent, accusing
the Texas governor of being soft on gun control.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes are too high for any presidential candidate to
stand on the sidelines'' of the gun-control debate, The Associated
Press quoted Gore as saying. The vice president provided the vote
to break a Senate deadlock and require background checks when guns
are sold a gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of gun control were quick to see Bush's action as
proof of a cozy relationship with the National Rifle Association,
which has championed similar bills in state capitals around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a question of priorities,'' said Joe Sudbay, director
of state legislation for Hand Gun Control in Washington. ``The NRA
said, We want this, and the governor showed that that's where his
loyalties lie.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill was one of more than a thousand awaiting the governor's
signature in the wake of the legislative session that adjourned on
May 31. The gun legislation had not emerged as a particularly
contentious issue in gun-friendly Texas, certainly not to the level
that Washington has become embroiled in the topic.
</P>
<P>
   Texas now becomes one of 14 states that have adopted such
legislation, passed in response to recent suits filed in New
Orleans, Atlanta and other cities.

MUNSON SIGNS WITH TIGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (CORRECTION: REMOVES PARAGRAPH ABOUT(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ His first swings as a professional baseball player
were in the batting cage at Tiger Stadium, his first paycheck is
the amount of money normally won by a lottery winner, and he gets
to hang out this weekend with his best friend Eric Chavez, who
happens to be the third baseman for the Oakland A's.
</P>
<P>
   The spoils are going to Eric Munson.
</P>
<P>
   Munson, a junior catcher who led USC to a national championship
in 1998, signed with Detroit on Friday, two weeks after the Tigers
made him the No. 3 pick in the major-league draft.
</P>
<P>
   Munson agreed to a four-year major-league contract worth $6.75
million. His signing bonus is $3.5 million and he will get $250,000
this season. He'll earn $750,000 next year, $1 million in 2001 and
$1.25 million in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't be more excited to be here,'' Munson, 21, told the
Detroit Free Press. ``It's a class organization. . . . I'm kind of
in awe seeing this old stadium. I'm looking forward to seeing
Comerica Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Moorad, Munson's Newport Beach-based adviser whose clients
include Pat Burrell, last year's No. 1 overall pick, and Arizona
first baseman Travis Lee, negotiated the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Munson will stay in Detroit through Monday, working out with the
Tigers. By coincidence, Oakland's Chavez _ his best friend since
they were 4 years old _ also will be in town those four days with
the Athletics. The two planned to have dinner Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thrilled that it's worked out that way,'' Munson said.
``We've always dreamed to be on a big-league field, and doing it
together, it's a great time.''
</P>
<P>
   Munson will report to the Tigers' Single-A team in Lakeland,
Fla., next week, then will join West Michigan in the Single-A
Midwest League.
</P>
<P>
   Munson, 21, batted .346 with 15 home runs and 41 RBI this
season. He missed 21 games with a broken right hand.
