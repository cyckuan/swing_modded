HAVE A KOBE _ AND A SMILE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif _ It's not his scar-less, tireless, tightly
coiled legs that will make Kobe Bryant the go-to shooter if the Los
Angeles Lakers' first must-win game of 1999 is close in the final
minute today.
</P>
<P>
   It's not his clear, sharp eyes. It's not his long fingers. It's
not his feet, though they're quick as a shell game.
</P>
<P>
   It's definitely not the shoes.
</P>
<P>
   It's his teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Did you see them, displayed in an oddly timed smile, as Bryant
walked to the Lakers' bench in San Antonio on Wednesday night after
he missed two free throws that could have clinched a game the Spurs
went on to win?
</P>
<P>
   A smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know exactly what he was saying,'' Spurs reserve guard Steve
Kerr said Friday. ``He was saying, `I don't believe I missed those
free throws.' You have to laugh it off _ and he did.''
</P>
<P>
   A smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It says, `(That's) life ... I know I'm going to get another
opportunity,''' Lakers guard Derek Fisher said. ```Probably in this
game.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant didn't get another opportunity in that game. After Tim
Duncan gave the Spurs a one-point lead with a jump hook, Bryant's
in-bounds pass to Fisher was stolen with six seconds left, and free
throws gave San Antonio a 79-76 victory and a 2-0 lead in the
best-of-seven playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   Now Bryant wants another chance this afternoon. He doesn't think
he'll miss again.
</P>
<P>
   And if he gets it, bet on smiles all over the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   With Shaquille O'Neal bottled up by San Antonio's three-headed
defensive monster and his own predictability, and with Glen Rice
still waiting for a screen or two or three, the Lakers might have
to rely again on Kobe to create points out of thin air.
</P>
<P>
   Fine with him.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, the 20-year-old charges into the most dangerous
moment of the season today, leading again with his incisors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fearless? That's probably an understatement,'' Fisher said,
adding with a needless-to-say expression, ``We aren't overly
concerned about his confidence being shaken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kobe's accepted that type of responsibility since he's been in
the league. I really can't think of a time where he didn't want to
be in a pressure situation, want to have the ball in his hands with
a game on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Lakers possessions before the missed free throws, Bryant
sank the 3-pointer that gave them their last lead with :46 on the
clock.
</P>
<P>
   The shot from deep in the right corner also gave Bryant his
playoff career-high 28th point of the night. All of his averages in
the playoffs this year (20.3 points, 7.2 rebounds, 5.5 assists, 1.8
steals, 1.5 blocks) are up from the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   If Kobe came to the NBA with an all-style-no-substance rap and
provided skeptics were early confirmation with his airballs in the
dying seconds of the '96 playoff series against the Utah Jazz, he
is acquitting himself this month, win or lose.
</P>
<P>
   He stole the ball from Scottie Pippen and made the deciding free
throws in Game 1 of the opening series against the Houston Rockets.
He dominated Pippen in Game 2. He scored 13 straight Lakers points
in the first half of Game 4 when Rice was injured and out. He's the
leading Lakers scorer in the two games against the Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   Start worrying now? Why?
</P>
<P>
   Because they're down 0-2? ``This is small potatoes,'' Bryant
said _ smiling _ ``compared to what we were going through during
the regular season.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the sloppy Lakers play at the start of Game 2? ``It's
good to get it out of your system,'' Bryant said _ smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Because of those lost free throws at the end of Game 2? ``I
slept well, actually,'' Bryant said _ smiling.
</P>
<P>
   Lakers veterans, impatient for a championship, might prefer to
see a little more anguish on his face, instead of that
live-and-learn grin.
</P>
<P>
   But who'd want to take away that youthful bravado?
</P>
<P>
   Would any Laker trade places with Sean Elliott, the Spur
assigned to guard Bryant?
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants (the ball). You have to admire that,'' said Elliott,
who's 10 years his senior. ``A lot of guys in this league will run
from the ball at the end of the game. He's one of the rare guys who
run to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``(He'll) take responsibility for being the hero or the goat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's impressive,'' Kerr said. ``For anybody, let alone a
20-year-old.''
</P>
<P>
   Somebody asked Bryant Friday how much he would have bet he'd
sink those free throws.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have lost the house,'' he said. ``It was ... strange.
I didn't expect to miss.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I would love to be in the same position (today).''
</P>
<P>
   Lucky for the Lakers if he is.

WRESTLING LET SMALL, POOR LORD LITTLEBROOK WIN FAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE POPPER  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. JOSEPH, Mo. _ Now that small-time professional wrestling is
making a comeback in such places as the Beaumont Club in Kansas
City, Mo., the phone in Lord Littlebrook's house rings more often.
</P>
<P>
   Littlebrook is a wrestling trainer and promoter who lives in a
hillside house up here. He has a large chow chained in the yard and
a sign nearby that states ``Beware of Dog.''
</P>
<P>
   The chow yawns when visitors enter.
</P>
<P>
   Littlebrook wears tortoiseshell glasses and has a thick and
whitening beard. He drinks beer in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   He is 70 now, and he's been around the world more often than he
can count. He's been married six times. He does what he pleases
with his time.
</P>
<P>
   His vocabulary is vivid and profane, and he tells wonderful
stories that a newspaper like this won't print for fear of what
people might think.
</P>
<P>
   Littlebrook doesn't care what people think. He has proved all he
has to prove in this life.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't care about being in a newspaper either. Not anymore.
</P>
<P>
   But he agreed to talk with a reporter, probably out of kindness.
Because there was a time when being in the paper, any paper, was
part of his job, and he remembers that.
</P>
<P>
   He was a professional wrestler starting in the 1950s and a
made-to-order dude, a literal dude, strutting around like a Punch
cartoon version of an English lord _ homburg on head, umbrella in
hand, wearing three-piece pinstriped suits like some Saville Row
swell.
</P>
<P>
   He wore tuxedo jackets into the ring.
</P>
<P>
   He's not a real lord, of course, but he is English, and he is
little. As he sat in his kitchen chair, his feet didn't touch the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm 4 feet 4 inches tall, and I call myself a midget,'' he
said the other morning as he sipped a can of Milwaukee's Best
Light. ``I don't care what you call me, and that's the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``But where are my manners?'' he asked with sudden and lordly
propriety. ``Here I'm sitting with a beer and ... Do you want a
beer, guy? It's cheap ... stuff, but that way I can buy a lot of
it.''
`Never run away'
</P>
<P>
   He was born Eric Tovey, and he grew up in one of London's
toughest neighborhoods, a patch just north of the famed East End.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not even a policeman would walk those streets alone,'' he
said. ``They walked them in threes.''
</P>
<P>
   He was granted no quarter on account of size, not even on his
own block. When a much larger boy challenged him to fight, he went
to his father for advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big-man's world,'' said his father, Harry, a floor
and wall tiler.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you're just passing through it, Son, so do it right. Don't
never cry, and don't never run away. If you do, you'll be running
your whole life long. And remember this: All men are the same size
once you knock them down.''
</P>
<P>
   The advice stuck.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad was a wise old fella,'' said Littlebrook. ``He didn't
care if I won or lost. He just wanted me to make a place for
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   But Littlebrook's size mattered. He couldn't follow his father's
trade because his hands were too small. He hated school, where he
was often made to stand in a corner wearing a dunce cap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went there maybe 10 months in my whole life,'' he said. ``So
I sure ain't no speller.''
</P>
<P>
   He remembers everything he hears and sees, but he can't write
the names of his seven children very well.
</P>
<P>
   When he was 14 in the mid-1940s, he joined a circus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Dad I couldn't find any other job. So he bought me a
cheap little suitcase and helped me pack the few raggy things I
had.''
</P>
<P>
   Littlebrook's first job was in the circus cook house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I peeled a hundred ... pounds of potatoes every day,'' he
said. ``I did heavy tent work also and slept on a trunk with the
horses.''
</P>
<P>
   He was rescued by a clown who taught him some tricks and got him
a performing job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you're a circus artist, you're a member of a big
family,'' Littlebrook said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a clown I made 15 pounds a week. That's more than my dad
made.''
Trying out wrestling
</P>
<P>
   By 1949 he was part of an acrobatic comedy act that caught the
eye of an American talent scout. He was signed for a U.S. circus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sailed aboard the old Aquitania and ate my first steak on
that voyage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the circus went broke, and Littlebrook's American work
permit was in danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't you try wrestling?'' someone suggested.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know a thing about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No one does until they start.''
</P>
<P>
   He signed with a Detroit promoter who had a monopoly on midget
wrestling acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The promoter said he'd give me three months to show him
something. If I didn't, I was out. He told me if I ever walked away
from him, he'd blackball me for life. It was a hard way to go in
those days.''
</P>
<P>
   He was paid $3 for his first match in a small Michigan town.
</P>
<P>
   ``Later, sometimes we'd make as much as $100 a night. Some of
the fights were fixed, sure, but most promoters just asked for a
certain amount of time in the ring. They didn't care who won.''
</P>
<P>
   He was given name Lord Littlebrook and hated it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a `Lord' in America meant playing a bad guy,'' he said.
``And dressing up in those fancy clothes made me feel like a ...
ham bone tied up with a ribbon.''
</P>
<P>
   He changed his stage name to Richard Littlebrook and played a
good guy. He settled in St. Joseph.
</P>
<P>
   For years, then, it was one-night stands in small arenas,
waiting in fetid dressing rooms for someone to call out, ``Midgets
on next!''
</P>
<P>
   He helped pioneer midget tag teams and mixed midget/woman
wrestler teams. Eventually he learned the business side of
wrestling and became a promoter himself.
</P>
<P>
   The high point of his life, or so he says, was a wondrous love
affair with a beautiful 6-foot-4-inch underwater stripper who used
to carry him out of the bars they frequented, coyly announcing that
she was going to tuck him in.
</P>
<P>
   ``And she did that,'' he said. ``Oh yes, I did all right with
wrestling.''
</P>
<P>
   He's retired now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't go out the door unless I have to,'' he said. ``I
answer the phone, and if some promoter wants midgets, I got them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Otherwise, I drink beer and talk to my friends. If I want
fresh air, I sit on the porch. What else do you want to know? Hey,
you want another beer?''

DISPUTED THIRD-STRIKE CALL SINKS RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Oriole Park at Camden Yards' most-productive hitter
would be the best card the Rangers could play.
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore's Charles Johnson and Sidney Ponson trumped it, and
so, too, did plate umpire Dale Scott, according to Rangers
designated hitter Rafael Palmeiro, the productive hitter in
question.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's three-run, seventh-inning home run and Ponson's
120-pitch complete game _ one that included a controversial called
third strike during Palmeiro's ninth-inning at-bat _ propelled the
Orioles to a 3-2 victory last night.
</P>
<P>
   That ruined what appeared would be Palmeiro's triumphant return
to Baltimore's Inner Harbor, which witnessed his exploits with the
bat while playing for the Orioles the previous five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro greeted the Orioles with memories from that past with
his second-inning solo home run on a first-pitch, 95-mph fastball
from Ponson. Camden Yards' 25-foot high scoreboard in right field
could not stop it.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Ponson, though, prevented it from becoming
memorable.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro, who received a mixed reaction from the 45,867 fans
upon being introduced before his second-inning at-bat, received a
standing ovation from some of the fans soon after rounding third
base.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-throwing Ponson drew the louder ovation with his
ninth-inning strikeout of Palmeiro with a fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was that far outside,'' said Palmeiro, who claimed the
pitch was at least a foot off the plate. ``\RThe umpire\S saw it as
a strike, period. He called a strike, and I just walked away. If
\RPonson\S throws it over the plate, I hit it. I was geared for his
fastball, but it was out of my reach.''
</P>
<P>
   Ponson, who surrendered only six hits, to emerge victorious in
his duel with Rangers right-hander Rick Helling, threw Palmeiro six
consecutive sliders before unleashing a 99-mph fastball on his
117th pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second inning, I made a bad pitch, and Palmeiro hit it
out,'' Ponson said. ``I have confidence in myself, though, and I
said to myself, `If he's going to beat me, he's going to beat me
with my best stuff.' So, I threw him a 3-2 fastball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers entered the ninth trailing, 3-1, before Mark
McLemore drew a leadoff walk and advanced to third on a double by
Rusty Greer.
</P>
<P>
   McLemore scored on a run-scoring ground ball from Juan Gonzalez,
but Ponson retired Palmeiro and induced a game-ending flyball from
catcher Ivan Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Helling (4-5), emerged as the evening's hard-luck case by being
saddled with a loss, despite delivering the Rangers' first complete
game since Sept. 7. Helling also pitched that game, and the
Rangers' complete game before that. This, though, would be the
Rangers' first defeat in 10 games this season when receiving a
quality start from their rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a game I didn't deserve to lose, but he didn't deserve
to lose, either,'' Helling said of Ponson (4-3). ``Somebody's got
to lose, and I came up on the short end.''
</P>
<P>
   Helling entered the seventh inning with a four-hit shutout, but
the Orioles' Cal Ripken led off with a single and advanced to
second on a single by Delino DeShields.
</P>
<P>
   Helling threw the first two pitches for strikes and then
followed the Rangers' scouting report on DeShields by throwing
three consecutive curveballs out of the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw him three breaking balls in the dirt, and he didn't
swing any of them,'' Helling said. ``I made a good pitch on that
3-2 fastball, and he hit a 47-hopper through the hole'' and into
right field.
</P>
<P>
   Orioles shortstop Mike Bordick advanced the runners with a
sacrifice bunt before Johnson belted an 0-1 belt-high curveball
into the left-field seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I overthrew it, and it spun out of my hand and stayed up,''
Helling said. ``I made one bad mistake to CJ, and it cost me the
game.''

10 ARRESTED IN PHOENIX-BASED IMMIGRANT SMUGGLING RING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Federal authorities on Friday claimed a major victory in the
battle against illegal immigration with the dismantling of a
Phoenix-based ring that smuggled immigrants into Arizona then sent
them on to destinations across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The officials also announced indictments against 17 people, 10
of whom have already been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   According to an official of the Immigration and Naturalization
Service, undercover investi gators infiltrated the ring's
operations in Honduras, Guatemala and and El Salvador, where local
brokers recruited a steady flow of illegals.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the trip ranged from $5,000 to $9,000 per person,
officials said. Half of the cost was normally paid in advance,
while the remainder was due once the illegals reached Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investigation provided us insight into the detailed
mechanics of the smuggling trade, which will be invaluable to us in
the future,'' said Johnny Williams, western regional director for
the INS.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Fickett, deputy director of the INS Phoenix office that
conducted the investigation, said its techniques would be taught to
investigators across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have learned that by following the movement of money, you
can get at the corporate structure of these operations and do an
awful lot of damage to them,'' Fickett said.
</P>
<P>
   The smuggling ring took in enormous sums of money, officials
said. They said the it often moved 200 Central Americans per week.
</P>
<P>
   The route typically took them by bus across Mexico to the U.S.
border at Douglas, then by vans to Phoenix. Many of the illegals
were driven to Los Angeles and then flown to their final
destinations.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing at a news conference with Williams, U.S. Attorney Jose
de Jesus Rivera said seven of the 10 people arrested so far were
part of the ring's operations in Phoenix. One of those arrested in
Phoenix, Ymer Adid Aguilar-Yoc, was identified by officials as a
leader.
</P>
<P>
   Others were arrested in Los Angeles and Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   Once the illegals had reached Phoenix, they were locked in
``safe houses'' until the smuggling fees were paid in full.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment charges the alleged ring members not only with
smuggling illegal immigrants, but also with holding them hostage
and laundering the proceeds.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the illegals were typically held in the safe
houses until relatives wired the final payment to the ring through
a Western Union office in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Some $200,000 has been seized from the operation, officials
said, along with several vehicles. The investigation is ongoing and
more arrests are expected.
</P>
<P>
   INS spokeswoman Virginia Kice said immigrant smuggling has
become a multibillion-dollar business.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's more money in it than ever before, and it has become a
lot more sophisticated in terms of organization,'' Kice said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we use the money laundering laws, that not only helps us
to get at the profit motive, but the penalties for money laundering
are stiffer than for some of the more traditional charges related
to smuggling itself.'' &QL;

KOSOVO REFUGEES SPEND DIZZYING DAY IN L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PHILLIP W. BROWNE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Two months ago, Nuhi Vlashi watched helplessly as
Serbian forces executed and ``chopped to pieces'' his neighbors in
a Kosovar village, then stole everything they had.
</P>
<P>
   He and his family of eight were among the last to escape the
town of Hani-Elezit before Serbs closed the Macedonian border and
planted land mines.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, they spent their first day as the Los Angeles area's
newest residents in a two-story house in Simi Valley. They ate beef
stew and soup, watched a little television and got some much-needed
sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even dream I would ever be in America. It's still a
dream,'' Vlashi, 55, said through an interpreter Friday, flanked by
his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is very kind and hospitable. I am very pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite America's glamorous lifestyle and its creature comforts,
he ultimately wishes to return to his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dream is for NATO to help us go back home,'' Vlashi said.
``We don't want them to stop the bombing, even if it kills
Albanians. If they kill all of us, it's OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death is better than oppression.''
</P>
<P>
   Vlashi was among the first 28 Albanian refugees from Kosovo to
settle in Los Angeles on Friday, spending the day reacquainting
themselves with a relative who hasn't seen them in eight years. The
refugees, all members of the Vlashi family, arrived in Los Angeles
just before midnight Thursday to stay with volunteer families who
have opened their homes to them.
</P>
<P>
   In Sherman Oaks, another relative, 17-year-old Nick Vlashi, said
he wished he could be back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to go home to my country,'' he said in broken English.
But before then, he will be going to a baseball game, to the beach
and to see the new ``Star Wars'' film, said Bobbie Black, who is
hosting his family.
</P>
<P>
   At the Simi Valley home of Lloyd and Joan Martin, Nuhi Vlashi's
sons Safete, 12, and Mirvete, 13, ran through the back yard and
played. His daughters helped sweep the white tile entryway.
Vlashi's wife, 48-year-old Muradja, rested for the first time in
months in a crisp, clean bed.
</P>
<P>
   They all prayed for their 25-year-old son and brother who
remains in Kosovo, fighting with the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pray every day and night, but we know he is fighting for
freedom,'' he said, his eyes welling up. ``We pray he will return
to us.''
</P>
<P>
   Joan Martin, who opened her home to the refugees, said her first
24 hours with the family has been awe-inspiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they came into the airport with tears in their eyes, my
heart just sank,'' Martin said. ``But I was encouraged and
inspired.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin said they looked ``very scared'' and wouldn't speak the
first night. But the next morning, Lloyd Martin put out boxes of
cereal, cartons of milk, and a battery of spoons and bowls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We showed them what cereal is,'' Lloyd Martin said. ``Cheerios
was the winner.''
</P>
<P>
   All of the refugees now in Los Angeles are extended relatives of
Hajrush Vlashi and his wife, Renee. On Friday, Renee stood outside
her West Hills home while her extended family members ate and
rested.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are much more high-spirited today,'' Renee Vlashi said.
``They were very quiet and scared last night.''
</P>
<P>
   Things started to lighten up when she took a few of the women
shopping at Ralphs supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were looking around at all of the food and smiling a bit,
but they were still worn down after what they've been through,''
Renee Vlashi said. ``It would be different if they were here on
vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Vlashis learned that they could sponsor family members
as immigrants, Renee Vlashi, a professional puppeteer, pulled some
strings.
</P>
<P>
   The couple, who live in the San Fernando Valley, enlisted the
Jewish Federation to help them bring family members to the United
States from Macedonia, where they had fled from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Four synagogues in the San Fernando Valley became involved in
the effort. Six families agreed to house Vlashi's relatives for
several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Four other family members remain in Macedonia and were expected
to arrive later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very proud that we were able to accomplish this,'' said
Sunny Caine, chairwoman of the federation's resettlement
subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Other families are being housed in Westlake Village, Agoura
Hills, Calabasas and West Hills. The federation provides signed
assurances to the federal government that the agency will resettle
the families, who are recognized as refugees by the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The refugees will receive one month of cash assistance, which
averages about $300 a person, and three months of services.
</P>
<P>
   The hosts have been asked to house families for as long as two
weeks. In the meantime, the federation will seek rental housing and
provide limited financial assistance.
</P>
<P>
   While the NATO goal is to return the refugees to their Kosovo
homes under the protection of an international security force, they
are eligible to remain here as refugees.

HOME RUN SINKS NORTHRIDGE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Tara Glaister watched the ball leave UCLA's Easton
Stadium, then got philosophical.
</P>
<P>
   She could do little else, especially after her 13-strikeout
performance turned into just another stellar effort in a losing
cause.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota edged the Matadors 2-1 Friday in an NCAA regional game
on a seventh-inning home run by Dana Ballard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happens,'' Glaister said. ``It's frustrating, but it's part
of the game. You make the pitch or you don't.''
</P>
<P>
   The Golden Gophers (48-18) advanced to today's 10 a.m. winners'
bracket game against UCLA. Northridge (30-23) drops to the
elimination bracket and plays Missouri at 12:30 p.m. The Matadors
beat the Tigers 7-3 in Thursday's opener. A victory sends CSUN into
a 3:30 p.m. game against the Minnesota-UCLA loser; a loss ends the
Matadors season.
</P>
<P>
   Glaister did just about everything right. She recorded the first
seven outs by strikeout (although Minnesota scored an unearned run
in between) and finished with a five-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Her only miscue was Ballard's homer to left, Ballard's first in
more than a year and the fourth of the junior's career. But Ballard
has been the clutch hitter of late, having driven in two
seventh-inning, game-winning runs in the Big Ten tournament against
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Glaister (21-14) wanted the pitch inside, but the ball went over
the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, I missed a spot at the wrong time,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge couldn't muster enough offense despite chasing
Minnesota starter Steph Klaviter in the third inning, when the
Matadors scored their run. Catcher Jamie Moore singled off the
fence to score Jill Passafiume.
</P>
<P>
   Northridge managed just two hits off reliever Michelle Harrison
(10-7) over the final 42/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA 14, Creighton 0: Julie Adams hit two home runs, including a
grand slam, and drove in six to lead a 21-hit attack, and the
Bruins (57-6) eliminated the Blue Jays (31-28).
</P>
<P>
   Adams continued her torrid hitting in the regional, following
Thursday's two-homer, five-RBI effort against Alabama with a slam
to right field off Shelli Mellegaard (13-14) in the fifth inning.
She added a solo shot off Mellegaard to lead off the seventh inning
and later in the inning singled in another.
</P>
<P>
   The grand slam gave UCLA needed cushion because before that,
Amanda Freed (25-4) clung to a 1-0 lead. She stranded three
Creighton runners in scoring position through four innings and
finished with a four-hitter with 11 strikeouts and two walks for
her 14th shutout.

NORTHRIDGE WOMEN GET JUMP ON FIELD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KIRBY LEE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ LaTanya Collier finally got a fair jump in the
long jump in the Big Sky Conference Championships on Friday at Cal
State Northridge.
</P>
<P>
   The Northridge junior, who has had a history of trouble on the
board and fouled out of the conference indoor championships the
last two seasons, hit her mark on Friday to sail to victory in a
career-best 19 feet, 11} inches.
</P>
<P>
   Collier's triumph added to LaShaunda Fowler's fourth at 19-1{
and Brandi Prieto and Anicia Rimm's fifth and sixth with wind-aided
18-9\ and 18-8{ marks gave the Matadors 22 points and a convincing
jump toward their second outdoor conference championship in three
years.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors are in first with 68 points after six events in the
four-day meet that concludes today. Northern Arizona is second with
43 and Idaho State is third with 34.
</P>
<P>
   The Weber State men lead after seven events with 61 points;
Northridge is fifth with 29.
</P>
<P>
   The Northridge women picked up 23 points in the pole vault,
placing four among the top five with Allyson Crosby, Monica Tobin,
Jennifer Capehart (each at 11-8) and Lisa Rugenstein (11-1{)
finishing second through fifth. Marisol Barajas added a fourth
place in the 10,000 in 36:01.84.
</P>
<P>
   Collier's performance in the long jump exceeded her
personal-best of 19-7{ set in April and was 11 inches farther than
her best in her freshman season when she finished fourth in the
outdoor conference finals. Collier, who competes in the triple jump
today, had four jumps of 19-2 or better and two fouls well over 20
feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get too emotional, too excited and too pumped up when I am
on the runway,'' Collier said. ``Everybody is crossing their
fingers and really tense because I can blow real good opportunities
by fouling. There are too many times I have walked away from a
competition knowing that I did not win because of some mistake that
I made.''
</P>
<P>
   With the loss of sprinter Genia Seymore to a stress fracture,
Collier's points in the long jump might be the boost the Matadors

<P>
   Alan Greenspan, chairman of America's Federal Reserve, is
sometimes credited with the power of an invincible Jedi knight who
can protect the economy from all evil forces: inflation, deflation,
recession or global financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this week, Greenspan's chosen weapon looked like a battered
tennis racket, not a mighty lightsabre.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the first signs that inflationary pressures could be on
the rise, the Fed left interest rates unchanged at 4.75 percent,
and chose merely to hint that it might tighten policy in future.
</P>
<P>
   This sounds prudent but is actually risky: if the beast of
inflation escapes, the increase in interest rates needed to
recapture it will then have to be bigger. And by holding rates
steady, the Fed continues to fuel a share-price bubble that if
(when?) it bursts will damage the whole economy.
</P>
<P>
   America's economic performance has been undeniably impressive
under Greenspan's care. The economy is enjoying its longest-ever
peacetime expansion and its lowest unemployment rate for almost 30
years; and, until now, inflation has remained remarkably subdued.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible that the jump in America's headline inflation
rate to 2.3 percent in April was a blip, caused by special factors.
After all, the rate of growth of wages has been declining.
</P>
<P>
   If so, it is argued, the Fed was wise to hold its fire. But
there were other reasons why the central bank should have been more
on its guard than usual.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of growth of real domestic demand _ 7 percent at an
annual rate in the first quarter _ was much too fast for comfort.
And the labor market seems dangerously tight. If unemployment
continues to fall, wages will certainly accelerate. The only
question is when.
</P>
<P>
   Despite talk of a ``new paradigm,'' a large part of the fall in
American inflation over the past two years has itself been caused
by one-off factors, notably lower oil and commodity prices, and a
strong dollar.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to deny that America has seen real economic
improvements. New technology and increased competition seem to have
boosted productivity growth, though this might not last.
</P>
<P>
   But the worry is that these gains have combined with a lax
monetary policy to encourage speculative excesses. Several signs of
frothiness have emerged. &QL;

   &UR; (600-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 375) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The level of share prices is hard to justify even on the most
optimistic assumptions about future profits. Despite the first
signs that inflationary pressures could be on the rise, the Fed
left interest rates unchanged at 4.75 percent, and chose merely to
hint that it might tighten policy in future.
</P>
<P>
   This sounds prudent but is actually risky: if the beast boom is
starting to spill over into other assets, such as prime city
property and fine art; there has been a surge in borrowing by firms
and households; and the current-account deficit has risen to record
levels.
</P>
<P>
   These look like the classic symptoms of an overheating economy.
Some economists argue that, because of uncertainties about whether
and how the relationship between growth and inflation has changed,
and because forecasters have consistently overestimated inflation
in recent years, the Fed is still right to play safe until more
data confirm that inflation is reviving.
</P>
<P>
   An unnecessary interest-rate rise, it is said, risks cutting the
expansion short too soon. But is this really the ``safe'' option?
</P>
<P>
   The Fed, remember, cut interest rates three times last autumn,
by a total of three-quarters of a percentage point, in response to
fears about a credit crunch in the wake of Russia's default.
</P>
<P>
   Since then fears of a crunch have faded, the Dow Jones
Industrial Average has gained 40 percent, and the American economy
has proved to be growing even more briskly than had been predicted.
</P>
<P>
   The Economist's poll of forecasters has lifted its average
forecast for growth in 1999 to 3.6 percent, up from less than 2
percent last October.
</P>
<P>
   Economic prospects in the emerging world also look brighter, so
several of the one-off factors holding down American inflation may
soon go into reverse. Oil prices have already bounced up and
commodity prices have stopped falling. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As growth abroad recovers, America will become more vulnerable
to inflation unless its domestic demand slows. There is therefore a
strong case for reversing some of last year's easing.
</P>
<P>
   To argue that it is safer for the Fed to wait until it sees
inflation actually rising before it acts is like saying that there
is no reason to brake a runaway car until it is a few feet from the
cliff's edge.
</P>
<P>
   It takes at least a year for interest-rate changes to have their
main impact on the economy, which is why policy must be
forward-looking. Indeed, with domestic demand rising so rapidly,
the safe policy would surely have been to nudge rates up by a
quarter-point.
</P>
<P>
   This would have acted as a backstop in case activity does not
slow of its own accord (as the Fed has repeatedly, and wrongly,
forecast). It would also be a timely reminder to financial markets
that there are still such things as risks and downsides.
</P>
<P>
   By cutting interest rates three times last year, Greenspan may
have inadvertently sent a message to the markets that he will do
all he can to prevent a financial crash.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the dangerous (and flawed) notion that the Fed has
abolished the business cycle and so ensured ever-rising share
prices may well have given investors, firms and consumers a
deceptive feeling of security, which has encouraged them to take on
excessively risky positions.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the hype surrounding Japan's economic strength in the
1980s eventually spun out of control, so America's genuine recent
economic gains have been overhyped.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Fed acted earlier to let some air out of Wall Street's
bubble, America's economy might not now be looking so dangerously
unbalanced.
</P>
<P>
   The central bankers should not bear all _ or even most _ of the
blame, for it is devilishly difficult to tell the difference
between a market that is rationally exuberant and one that is
affected by a speculative bubble.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates are a blunt weapon to wield in such
circumstances; it is impossible to predict how far share prices
could fall once they turn, or how severe the economic consequences
might be.
</P>
<P>
   These are understandable concerns. They are not, however, a
reason for Greenspan to go soft on the real menace: inflation. It
is past time for him to demonstrate that the force is still with
him. &QL;

 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Praise be, Israel has a new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, an unexpectedly high proportion of Israelis showed
that they wanted to see the back of Benjamin (Bibi) Netanyahu, who,
although skilled on television _ he conceded the election, and
resigned as the Likud's leader, with commendable grace _ was a
disastrous man to have in charge of a country.
</P>
<P>
   Ehud Barak, the Labor Party's leader, and now Israel's too, has
a head start simply by not being Bibi.
</P>
<P>
   The election results leave him with problems in building a
strong coalition. But if he is to bring Israel the peace he has
promised, he must move swiftly on the Arab front.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he will have to bargain hard and thoughtfully for the
best deal he can get that is compatible with an enduring peace.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no advantage for Israel in going slowly: every day
of unnecessary delay builds up resentment at the painful
compromises that are integral to such an agreement. Above all, any
delay gives opportunities for the anti-peace lobby, Israeli and
Palestinian, to organize disruptive dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has already promised to bring Israel's soldiers home from
Lebanon in a year's time. Since this can be done safely only in the
context of a peace deal with the Syrians, who pull the strings that
control Lebanon's Hezbollah guerrillas, talks with Syria need to be
restarted quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Their success will partly depend on the hidden agenda of Syria's
foxy president, Hafez Assad. But, given a degree of goodwill, a
land-for-peace deal, with security provisions, should be within
reasonably easy grasp: the Israelis cannot expect to continue their
occupation of Syria's Golan Heights, but nor can the Syrians expect
to regain unconditional control.
</P>
<P>
   Peace with the Palestinians is a far more complicated,
multifaceted and passionate affair. The general outlines of a
permanent Israeli-Palestinian settlement have already been worked
out, providing the basis for negotiation on the crucially important
detail.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, there is no reason why it should take more than a
year _ maybe much less _ to punch these fuzzy half-agreements into
a firm shape that a majority of Israelis would accept in exchange
for peace with their neighbors, and that a majority of West Bankers
and Gazans would accept in exchange for a viable state. But, once
again, this is dependent on a solid foundation of goodwill.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's shortcut to goodwill is, quite simply, to note what the
previous government did and do the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has already said that he will redirect money away from
settlement expansion to various good causes: he could underline his
commitment by suspending activity on that most controversial of all
Jewish settlements, Har Homa in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, he has to pick up the pieces of the Wye agreement
that Netanyahu left broken and scattered: Israel is committed to
withdrawing from another chunk of the West Bank, releasing
political prisoners and creating a passage between the West Bank
and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   These are promises to be swiftly fulfilled before moving on to
the next stage.
</P>
<P>
   A harder task faces the Palestinians, now that the Israelis have
chosen a leader not opposed to the Oslo peace process. For the past
three years, they have been the ``virtuous'' ones, required to do
little more than swallow their grievances as the world growled at
an Israel defaulting on its signed undertakings.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Palestinian frustration has been fermenting, and
the methods used by Yasser Arafat and his men to quell dissent have
been crude, and sometimes cruel.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however welcome the change, Yasser Arafat's job can only
become harder. For, whatever settlement he is able to wrestle out
of Israel, most Palestinians outside the West Bank and Gaza, and
many inside, will be opposed to it.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing should temper the world's relief at Barak's election.
But complacency would be folly: the closer Israel and the
Palestinians get to a permanent peace, the more dissenter s, on
both sides, will be determined to capsize it. &QL;

<P>
   Praise be, Israel has a new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, an unexpectedly high proportion of Israelis showed
that they wanted to see the back of Benjamin (Bibi) Netanyahu, who,
although skilled on television _ he conceded the election, and
resigned as the Likud's leader, with commendable grace _ was a
disastrous man to have in charge of a country.
</P>
<P>
   Ehud Barak, the Labor Party's leader, and now Israel's too, has
a head start simply by not being Bibi.
</P>
<P>
   The election results leave him with problems in building a
strong coalition. But if he is to bring Israel the peace he has
promised, he must move swiftly on the Arab front.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he will have to bargain hard and thoughtfully for the
best deal he can get that is compatible with an enduring peace.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no advantage for Israel in going slowly: every day
of unnecessary delay builds up resentment at the painful
compromises that are integral to such an agreement. Above all, any
delay gives opportunities for the anti-peace lobby, Israeli and
Palestinian, to organize disruptive dissent.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has already promised to bring Israel's soldiers home from
Lebanon in a year's time. Since this can be done safely only in the
context of a peace deal with the Syrians, who pull the strings that
control Lebanon's Hezbollah guerrillas, talks with Syria need to be
restarted quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Their success will partly depend on the hidden agenda of Syria's
foxy president, Hafez Assad. But, given a degree of goodwill, a
land-for-peace deal, with security provisions, should be within
reasonably easy grasp: the Israelis cannot expect to continue their
occupation of Syria's Golan Heights, but nor can the Syrians expect
to regain unconditional control.
</P>
<P>
   Peace with the Palestinians is a far more complicated,
multifaceted and passionate affair. The general outlines of a
permanent Israeli-Palestinian settlement have already been worked
out, providing the basis for negotiation on the crucially important
detail.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, there is no reason why it should take more than a
year _ maybe much less _ to punch these fuzzy half-agreements into
a firm shape that a majority of Israelis would accept in exchange
for peace with their neighbors, and that a majority of West Bankers
and Gazans would accept in exchange for a viable state. But, once
again, this is dependent on a solid foundation of goodwill.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's shortcut to goodwill is, quite simply, to note what the
previous government did and do the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has already said that he will redirect money away from
settlement expansion to various good causes: he could underline his
commitment by suspending activity on that most controversial of all
Jewish settlements, Har Homa in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, he has to pick up the pieces of the Wye agreement
that Netanyahu left broken and scattered: Israel is committed to
withdrawing from another chunk of the West Bank, releasing
political prisoners and creating a passage between the West Bank
and Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   These are promises to be swiftly fulfilled before moving on to
the next stage.
</P>
<P>
   A harder task faces the Palestinians, now that the Israelis have
chosen a leader not opposed to the Oslo peace process. For the past
three years, they have been the ``virtuous'' ones, required to do
little more than swallow their grievances as the world growled at
an Israel defaulting on its signed undertakings.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, Palestinian frustration has been fermenting, and
the methods used by Yasser Arafat and his men to quell dissent have
been crude, and sometimes cruel.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however welcome the change, Yasser Arafat's job can only
become harder. For, whatever settlement he is able to wrestle out
of Israel, most Palestinians outside the West Bank and Gaza, and
many inside, will be opposed to it.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing should temper the world's relief at Barak's election.
But complacency would be folly: the closer Israel and the
Palestinians get to a permanent peace, the more dissenter s, on
both sides, will be determined to capsize it. &QL;

NET'S GREAT RIDE AT AN END?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- What goes up, must come down.
</P>
<P>
   This time-worn adage has proved true for high-flying Internet
stocks, especially during the past month. After spectacular
run-ups, they've floated back down to earth.
</P>
<P>
   For proof, just look at the Hambrecht &AMP; Quist Internet Index,
one of the leading indicators of the online sector. In the past
month, it's down 19 percent. In the past (ITAL) month (END ITAL).
Over the same period, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 4.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say it's a combination of factors that have taken the
steam out of the sector: The threat of higher interest rates, a
shift among institutional investors to cyclical and industrial
stocks, profit-taking by Net investors and renewed concerns about
valuation.
</P>
<P>
   Already, some mutual funds have been unloading Internet stocks
-- and, to a lesser extent, their cousins, the technology stocks --
since the beginning of the year and contributing to the weakness,
said Patrick Dorsey, technology analyst at fund-rating firm
Morningstar in Chicago. Dorsey said Fidelity Magellan, the nation's
largest fund, and Legg Mason Value Trust were two of the most
well-known mutual funds selling off Net shares.
</P>
<P>
   Why? After two years of spectacular growth, investors apparently
finally think that Internet stocks are overvalued, analysts said.
And this week's announcement by a key Federal Reserve committee
that it's leaning toward raising interest rates because of signs of
inflation additionally spooked the markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus -- with the Fed's move -- will be on earnings now,''
said Chris Orndorff, head of equity investments at Payden &AMP; Rygel,
a $27 billion money management firm based in Los Angeles. ``That
will bring some sanity to Internet stocks'' since only a handful of
these companies have earnings.
</P>
<P>
   Why are interest rates so important to Internet stocks? The most
common gauge investors use to judge whether a stock is expensive --
and needs to be sold -- is the price-to-earnings ratio, or P/E. The
ratio compares the price of one share of the company to the amount
of money it earns for that one share.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks have high P/E ratios because, until recently,
there have been more people wanting to buy them than sell them.
Thus, the share prices have gone up.
</P>
<P>
   In a low-interest environment, investors are willing to pay more
for a stock because they believe economic factors will stimulate
business. The price they are paying now bets that future earnings
will be good enough to justify it. But if interest rates rise,
business will slow down because it will cost more to borrow.
Consumers will spend less as well. In addition, a rise in inflation
makes future earnings worth less.
</P>
<P>
   ``People fear a rise in interest rates,'' Dorsey said. ``High
interest rates are death to high price-to-earnings stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks are expected to weaken further in the near
future as the flight to other investments continues, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   But it doesn't mean that the bull market is ending. Despite its
volatility, the overall market isn't turning bearish, analysts
believe.
</P>
<P>
   One good sign is that breadth -- the number of stocks rising vs.
declining -- has broadened as more companies enjoy an increase in
their stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big positive. The bull will continue,'' Orndorff said.
``In the last 60 days, breadth has really increased. Mid- and
small-caps had gains.''
</P>
<P>
   How should Internet investors play this market?
</P>
<P>
   Look for bargains in solid companies that will survive the
coming shakeout, advised Dorsey, the Morningstar technology
analyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``AOL, Yahoo! and Amazon.com will probably be higher'' in the
long run, he said. ``They will probably be around.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, he has less confidence in stocks like theglobe.com,
which perhaps does not have the same staying power as an America
Online.
</P>
<P>
   Dorsey compared the current Internet marketplace to the
automobile industry of the early 20th century. Like the Internet,
the invention of cars changed people's lives. In the beginning,
there were dozens of American car companies. But only a handful
remain today. The same cycle will befall Internet companies, Dorsey
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's going to be a lot fewer Internet companies two years
from now,'' he predicted.

<P>
   NATO is not losing the war for Kosovo, but it is not winning it
quickly enough either.
</P>
<P>
   Its bombing has inflicted terrible damage on Serb military
targets, but not yet enough, it seems, to force Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic to yield.
</P>
<P>
   Its record has been exemplary compared with almost any previous
air campaign, yet the toll of mistakes and casualties _ some of
them civilians caught accidentally in the bombing, others
deliberately herded into harm's way by the Serbs _ is bound to
rise.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as NATO goes after every bridge, ammunition depot and
tank hideout that Milosevic might need to continue his ethnic
cleansing in Kosovo, Serb forces there continue to do horrific
things to those ethnic Albanians still inside the province and
beyond western reach.
</P>
<P>
   To oblige the Serbs to halt the violence, and to get the
refugees back home, NATO needs either a workable peace agreement
soon _ diplomatic efforts are once again under way _ or the resolve
to enforce a settlement using troops of its own.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the two requirements are closely linked. If the allies
had looked readier for a ground war earlier this year to back up
their threatened air strikes, Milosevic might have been slower to
pick a fight and keener to talk peace.
</P>
<P>
   Western governments had their reasons for caution. Building a
consensus among 19 nations even for an air war seemed hard enough
at the time, so any commitment to start a ground invasion to
liberate Kosovo would have been politically much more divisive.
</P>
<P>
   This is God's own partisan country, not the tank-friendly desert
of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Western public opinion, it was believed, had no stomach for the
sorts of casualties that a ground war would have entailed. But
public opinion in the West has proved stouter in support of the air
campaign than the politicians had expected. In most countries _
including the United States, Britain and France _ it remains firm.
</P>
<P>
   It is popular pressure, too, that has pushed governments to take
in more refugees, though temporary homes still need to be found for
many more. And it is revulsion at the refugees' reports of mass
murder and rape, and the wholesale clearing and burning of
villages, that has forged the cohesion in NATO to continue the air
strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the allies cannot afford to dawdle. For a start, unless
Milosevic is made to back down pretty soon, there will be no chance
of getting most of the refugees back to their homes _ those that
are still standing _ before winter sets in.
</P>
<P>
   Equally serious, the allies' cohesion, firm as it has been so
far, may not remain so. Milosevic has been careful to let the
world's television cameras film only the limited damage from NATO's
bombs and missiles, not the scorched earth and mass graves in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion in the West, especially in the wobblier countries
such as Italy and Germany, gets queasier at every incident
involving unintended civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
   Any small fissures in NATO's otherwise solid front encourage
Milosevic to sit tight, rather than sue for peace.
</P>
<P>
   The allies need to do two things. The first is to step up the
air war. Although wave after wave of aircraft has been thrown into
the fray, all along NATO has been fighting the war with one wing
clipped. Only now is it preparing to launch air-defense-stretching
bombing raids from around the compass.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks ago America sent (an unmilitarily modest) two dozen of its
supposedly fearsome Apache anti-tank helicopters to take the fight
closer to those doing the Kosovo cleansing, but they have yet to
see action.
</P>
<P>
   NATO needs lots more of them _ and the permission to use them _
if it is to knock the fight out of the Serb forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Second, NATO governments need to start a build-up of combat
troops in the region.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's spokesmen claim it is winning the air war, cutting Serb
supply lines and separating Milosevic's forces in Kosovo so that
they can no longer offer coordinated resistance.
</P>
<P>
   If this is indeed so, then NATO's commanders need to be ready to
take advantage of their success and, with or without a peace
agreement already in their pocket, be able to start clearing
territory to escort the refugees safely home.
</P>
<P>
   And if it is not so, and Milosevic has plenty of fight in him
yet, then NATO will need more military options anyway to pile on
the pressure. In either case, there could well be western
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   This week Germany's chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, said it would
be ``unthinkable'' for German troops to take part in a ground war
in Kosovo. Yet how much more unthinkable that NATO's desire for a
risk-free war should allow Milosevic to win this one. &QL;

STATE SUING TO RECLAIM ESCROW FEES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY GREGORY J. WILCOX  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In a historic move, California Attorney General
Bill Lockyer has sued the state's title insurance and escrow
industries, alleging that for nearly 30 years they misappropriated
hundreds of millions of dollars in fees from property buyers.
</P>
<P>
   The suit claims money that should have been returned to buyers
of residential and commercial property once sales were complete was
kept by the companies.
</P>
<P>
   Fines against insurance and escrow companies and restitution of
an undetermined amount of money to California residents involved in
real estate transactions since 1970 are being sought.
</P>
<P>
   Lockyer filed the suit Wednesday in Sacramento County Superior
Court and planned to announce it at a press conference Monday. The
Daily News obtained a copy of the suit Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the title and escrow businesses named in the
suit could not be reached for comment on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The filing, made on behalf of the office of the state
controller, insurance commissioner and people of California, asks
that the suit be given class-action status for the millions of real
estate transactions that could be involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think potentially every homeowner could be owed funds,''
said Byron Tucker, the controller's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The suit alleges that some title and escrow companies:
</P>
<P>
   --Hold or held unclaimed escrow funds rather than turning the
money over to the state.

   --Charged California home buyers and other escrow customers fees
for services that were not provided.
</P>
<P>
   --Earned interest from financial institutions on customer funds
held in escrow accounts but then failed to transfer the interest to
customer accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The action is being taken against an industry that has largely
been overlooked by regulators but is an essential part of all real
estate transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Escrow companies serve as repositories for money that changes
hands while a sale is being completed and title companies make sure
the property being sold is in fact owned by the seller and not
encumbered by any liens or judgments.
</P>
<P>
   Companies found to have violated state law could be fined up to
$5,000 for each real estate transaction, an amount that could total
in the hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at both the Attorney General's Office and the
Controller's Office said it is too soon to speculate on how much
money might be owed to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Barankin, a spokesman for Lockyer, said this is the first
time regulators have taken a close look at the title and escrow
industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``After you have done 99percent of the work, you walk into some
office and sign a bunch of papers, and you never see them again.
Maybe you will get a check back from them,'' he said. ``It's an
aspect of the finance experience that is often overlooked and
ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   The suit claims that consumers who bought real estate have been
dinged in a variety of ways. One example would be escrow and title
companies charging a $10 fee for delivering documents when the
actual cost was a lot less.
</P>
<P>
   The state Controller's Office is a plaintiff because it
administers the state's unclaimed property fund. The state
insurance office is named as a plaintiff because it regulates the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Barankin said the suit is historic because it is a ``reverse
class-action'' _ the defendants are considered the class.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of a real estate sale, the escrow account is supposed
to have a zero balance. But the suit claims that escrow companies
sometimes did not disburse all of the funds in the account and kept
the money instead, collecting interest.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if someone was issued a check drawn on the escrow
account but never cashed it, the money remained in the account, the
suit said.
</P>
<P>
   It should have been turned over to the state.
</P>
<P>
   Barankin has some advice for consumers now in the process of
buying real estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone purchasing or selling their house ought not to be
afraid to ask detailed questions of their title and escrow
companies assisting them,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   People in the rich world are eating better, smoking less,
exercising more and receiving better medical care than they did 30
or 40 years ago. But are all these healthy activities not just
boring but positively unhealthy?
</P>
<P>
   So it would seem: more and more people are also living on
welfare benefits intended for the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers in some countries are so dire that it is a wonder
they can hobble along at all. In the Netherlands, for instance, 13
percent of the working-age population claims to be disabled.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, almost half the people of working age who claim a
welfare benefit are receiving money for being disabled or sick; one
man in four aged between 60 and 65 is claiming incapacity benefit.
</P>
<P>
   In Norway, more than 57 percent of people aged between 55 and 64
are registered as disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Can the figures be reconciled? Or is disability simply the rich
world's biggest welfare scam?
</P>
<P>
   Incontrovertibly, the health of the old has been improving.
Being old has never been much fun.
</P>
<P>
   The joke used to be that, if you woke up in the morning and
nothing ached, you were probably dead. But life expectancy for
people aged 65 has continued to rise, and so have the number of
years that older folk can expect to live for without suffering
severe or even moderate disability.
</P>
<P>
   Most people can expect a couple of unpleasant years of
incapacity at the end of their lives, but that period now typically
arrives when they reach their mid-to-late 70s or even their 80s,
rather than their 60s.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, American research suggests that the decline in
disability among older people has accelerated: it was faster in the
first half of the 1990s than in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   So why the near-universal rise in the number of people of
working age who claim to be disabled? The truth is that most
claimants are merely suffering the pains of being past the prime of
life and unwanted by employers.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of rich countries have long used disability benefits as a
way to shovel out of sight the most intractable group of the
unemployed: people _ mainly men _ in their 50s and early 60s.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some governments have encouraged older workers to claim
to be disabled by obliging doctors to consider the state of the job
market when deciding whether a patient should be registered as
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   Germany, Italy and Finland all make access to disability
benefits easier when unemployment is high.
</P>
<P>
   Using disability benefits to ``solve'' labor market problems is
unwise and unkind. It inflates the cost of supporting older
unemployed people, and deflects governments from searching for
better solutions for their plight.
</P>
<P>
   But tightening the rules is politically fraught, as Britain's
prime minister, Tony Blair, has found: he has faced a furious
parliamentary revolt over a plan to make disability benefits harder
to claim.
</P>
<P>
   Even when governments try to tighten the rules, people may find
ingenious ways around them, if the incentive is great enough.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, a rise in the number of supposedly disabled
claimants seems to have coincided with tighter policing of access
to unemployment benefit.
</P>
<P>
   In the Netherlands, arguably the world leader in phoney
disability, a tougher government line on physical disability has
encouraged more folk to claim mental disability.
</P>
<P>
   Proving that somebody does not suffer from disabling stress is
even harder than proving that their backache is too bad for them to
work.
</P>
<P>
   One option is to tighten the rules on what counts as disability,
and to administer them vigorously. Another is to change the balance
of incentives.
</P>
<P>
   In many countries, benefits reward those who retire early,
especially if their incomes are already low. It would be better to
ensure that those who continue to work in late middle age also
continue to clock up extra pension entitlement.
</P>
<P>
   A third possibility is to alter expectations. Of course, some
disabled folk cannot work and will never work. But, for many, a job
would bring self-respect.
</P>
<P>
   If governments assumed that even the disabled should sometimes
work for their welfare, the truly disabled might be the most
grateful of all. &QL;

busy doing the math for his new client, the Newark Public Schools.
How much money could the district make if it signed an exclusive

more than it gets now. DeRose and his company, DD Marketing, are
storming a once-quiet backwater in the soft-drink business. Schools

ownership. Of the world's 85,500 self-propelled cargo vessels of
100 gross tons or greater, some 16,000 are registered in the 27
countries that the union lists as flags of convenience. The union
says such vessels have poor safety records, frequently do not pay

LAKERS LOOK LIKE YELLOWBRICK ROADKILL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's quiz: What do the Los Angeles Lakers have in common with
key characters in the film ``The Wizard of Oz?''
</P>
<P>
   Answer: No heart, no brains, no courage.
</P>
<P>
   This may be a rather harsh assessment of our dysfunctional NBA
team, but the time has definitely come to stop coddling these young
men. The free pass has expired. Excuses will no longer be accepted
for their collective youth and inexperience.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' last two efforts against the San Antonio Spurs,
leaving them down 0-2 in their second-round playoff series heading
into Game 3 today at the Forum, were identical to their playoff
efforts against Utah the last two seasons, absolutely lacking in
the essentials that separate teams that win from those who only
talk about winning.
</P>
<P>
   They blew leads. They bungled opportunities. They didn't listen
to their coaches. They changed plays on the fly. They preened with
time still left on the clock. They reverted to individual play when
team play was needed most. They waited for someone else to step up
while they stood in place.
</P>
<P>
   They made excuses. They blamed the officials. And they said the
next game would be different, words that have been used so often
that they've totally lost their meaning.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' biggest sin is that they have fulfilled the scouting
report every team has on them, the one that says The Lakers will
will find a way to screw up if you give them the chance.
</P>
<P>
   Pick a player, any player.
</P>
<P>
   Glen Rice, the shooter the Lakers felt they needed to offset
Shaquille O'Neal's inside game, has proven to be very streaky. That
in itself is not a problem. It becomes a problem, though, when Rice
continues to shoot when he's iced up. Plus, he's lousy defensively.
Getting Rice made sense, but not at the cost of the team's best
defender, Eddie Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant, the prodigy, is nearing the moment when his mind
gets in sync with his talent. But he is not ready to take on the
entire responsibility of winning like Michael Jordan did six times.
The more he finds himself cast in that role prematurely, the more
likely he is to become a scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Fisher, the Lakers' point guard, hustles like a maniac and
has nothing but good intentions. But the major prerequisites of a
point guard are to be smarter than everyone else, to know what play
to run or change, and have the respect of his teammates, so that
they'll look to him for guidance. Fisher doesn't have that.
</P>
<P>
   All of the forwards asked to fill the power spot have been
unsuitable and uninspired to the task. Be it against widebody
Charles Barkley or the thin Tim Duncan, they have yet to keep
anybody from their appointments in the post. Did you ever think the
day would come when the Lakers would miss Elden Campbell? Well,
it's here.
</P>
<P>
   The most dependable trait of Robert Horry and Rick Fox is that
they are undependable. They may have a popup sensational evening
from time to time, but they never have back-to-back good efforts.
That Fox has been filling the role of statesman on this team is
glaring insight into how little character fills the Lakers locker
room.
</P>
<P>
   That brings us to Shaquille O'Neal. In his three years as a
Laker, he has impressed everyone with a superb work ethic and a
real desire to be successful. He wants to be the man to carry the
team on his back.
</P>
<P>
   But desire doesn't make it so. Shaq occasionally gets exposed
defensively in one-on-one situations, and he could use a few weeks
of intense study on the value of the blocked shot. If he had as
much passion on the defensive end that he has on offense, we might
not be worrying about anyone else's liabilities.
</P>
<P>
   What he needs to do most is to stop trying to fill the role of
big brother or big daddy on this team, or some kind of general
manager in shorts suggesting help in the form of Dennis Rodman and
Glen Rice. If he wants to kick some ass, he might consider starting
in his own locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Comparisons are often odious, but they're also often
unavoidable. When you look at this Lakers team, you do not see the
passion to win that made Magic Johnson's Lakers special.
</P>
<P>
   You do not see anyone sublimating their game for the good of the
team as James Worthy and Byron Scott.
</P>
<P>
   You do not see players like Michael Cooper and Kurt Rambis
filling their roles to perfection.
</P>
<P>
   And while Kareem Abdul-Jabbar was never a personal favorite, I
never had to worry about his focus or his desire to win. Kareem
didn't need a Superman tattoo to announce his arrival, and he
understood the game had two baskets that needed attending, not just
one. And once Kareem got a taste of success, too, he wanted more.
</P>
<P>
   Could this all have been avoided? I'd like to think so. If the
Lakers had fired Del Harris in 1997, when the Del-Nick Van Exel war
escalated, maybe the team goes in another direction.
</P>
<P>
   With Nick, the Lakers have an on-court leader and an outside
shooter. Maybe Kobe doesn't have to become a go-to guy before he's
ready. Maybe the Lakers put their personnel emphasis on a true
power forward and forget about trading Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they have a coach in his second year with the team,
undoubtedly someone with more experience than Kurt Rambis.
</P>
<P>
   That's a lot of what-ifs. But clearly, any Laker fantasy is much
better than their current reality, which is on the yellow brick
road to another lousy postseason.

M'S WIN BIG WITH `LITTLE BALL' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Russ Davis was not surprised when he got the
sign, because he had the same idea himself.
</P>
<P>
   It was the top of the eighth inning at Kauffman Stadium, and the
Mariners had a three-run lead over the Kansas City Royals. John
Mabry led off with a single, and up came Davis _ nine homers on the
year, and fresh off a run-scoring double _ to bunt. Mabry went to
second on the sacrifice, and scored the Mariners' final run when
David Bell singled two batters later.
</P>
<P>
   It's standard baseball, if not standard M's baseball. The
Mariners had just four sacrifices coming into Friday night, one
fewer than the Royals' Carlos Febles. No team has more homers than
Seattle, but only three have fewer sacrifices.
</P>
<P>
   So when Davis got the bunt down, it made a fitting symbol for
the Mariners' 5-2 win, their first this year in a game in which
they did not homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's always good to get a win like that, because this is a big
power-hitting team, and we live and die by the long ball,'' Davis
said. ``But to be successful, you've got to do the little things,
too. We showed that we can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   A win tonight would put the Mariners at .500, where they haven't
been in 34 games. If they do so, the M's would be following the
lead of starter Jamie Moyer, who worked six strong innings to even
his record at 4-4.
</P>
<P>
   Moyer allowed seven hits and one run Friday night, mastering a
Royals team that hadn't lost since he blanked them for eight
innings last Sunday. He did it with exceptional command; for the
first time in his 10 starts, he issued no walks.
</P>
<P>
   That's crucial against the Royals, who can sustain rallies and
have scored 57 runs in their last five games _ excluding the two
started by Moyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``With these guys, you've got to be around the plate, but you
can't get too much of the plate, because they put the ball in play
and move the ball around,'' Moyer said. ``To make them score runs,
you've got to make them manufacture them. That's what we did
tonight. Fortunately, they only got two, but they're tough _ one
pitch, they get a single, the next pitch, they steal second. They
can put runs up like it's playground baseball _ running and running
and running.''
</P>
<P>
   Running and running for the Mariners was Ken Griffey, Jr., who
legged out a double and stole two bases. With nine steals, he
stands first on the team and is among the AL leaders.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh inning, Griffey slid hard into third for his
second steal, two innings after Alex Rodriguez had done the same
advancing from first on a Griffey single. The bag came loose, the
stake noticeably bent, and Griffey left the game in the ninth with
cramps.
</P>
<P>
   No big deal, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Alex slid, it bent, and when I slid, it just came out,''
Griffey said. ``Those were two rough slides going into third. But
it's just cramps, that's all. I was a little dehydrated, too. I'm
fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder John Mabry had the most eventful day. He made a
diving catch in the first inning, then battled the fading sun _
and, he said, the new see-through backstop behind home plate _ for
another catch.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, with a runner on third and the Mariners leading
4-1, he dove again to catch a sinking fly ball by Joe Randa, ending
the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Mabry was on base four times, each time figuring in a run. He
singled home the M's first run in the second, beat out an infield
hit to sustain a two-run rally in the fourth, walked and scored in
the sixth and finished with the leadoff single in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   The former Cardinal has hit safely in six of his last eight
games, raising his average 53 points, to .272. Asked afterward by a
St. Louis reporter if he still was a .300 hitter, Mabry had a quick
reply.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, certainly,'' he said. ``Definitely. Through the course of
500 at-bats, I think it'll work out that I can hit .300 again.
You've got to believe in yourself, that's the No. 1 thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mabry, who hit between .284 and .307 his first four years before
tailing off last year, said he's feeling more and more comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been working on it, trying to get the mechanics right and
putting myself in a better position to hit,'' he said. ``Transfer
the weight and get the timing down. It usually comes after that,
but you have to get the basics first.''
</P>
<P>
   The basics? Seemed to be the the theme of the evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hit the ball behind the runner a few times, which is good
to see,'' said manager Lou Piniella. ``Sacrificed a runner over,
got a two-out hit to give us that cushion. Those are things you'd
like to see us do with consistency, and let the home runs come when
they come.''

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexico this week launched a new game. It is one
the whole family, indeed the whole country, will enjoy, and may
even take a small part in. All the main players must follow the
rules; or if they do not, they must at least pretend to do so
convincingly.
</P>
<P>
   And the lucky winner will end up as president of Mexico _ maybe.
</P>
<P>
   The game is the presidential nomination of the Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI).
</P>
<P>
   For six of the PRI's seven decades in power that has been a
rather strange contest, since it has always involved only one
player _ the incumbent president _ and only one rule: the president
would choose the candidate, who would then duly succeed, either
because the people voted for him, or because the electoral
commission (which is to say the government) said they had.
</P>
<P>
   Now the electoral commission is independent, and the PRI can no
longer take victory for granted.
</P>
<P>
   In an election in 1997, it lost its majority in Congress for the
first time. Even so, the PRI may still win next year's presidential
race, but to do so it must avoid splits.
</P>
<P>
   Recent state elections have highlighted that risk. Where the
party has held primaries, and done so cleanly, it has gone on to
win the state governorship.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, it has sometimes had problems: on three occasions,
state elections have been won for the opposition by PRI renegades
denied their party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Such experiences seem to have persuaded President Ernesto
Zedillo and the PRI's bigwigs of the need for radical change in the
presidential-nomination game.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo hinted at this last year, famously promising to end the
traditional selection method known as the dedazo, or
finger-pointing, by saying ``I will cut off my finger.''
</P>
<P>
   But when in March he suggested a primary-election system similar
to that in the United States, with votes staggered over several
months, skeptics reckoned that would let him secure a commanding
lead for his favored candidate by choosing which states would hold
early ballots.
</P>
<P>
   ``One must not forget that hands have ten fingers,'' said Jesus
Silva-Herzog, himself passed over for the presidency in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The rules announced on May 17 amputate several more fingers, as
Silva-Herzog conceded. The whole country will vote in a single
primary on Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being restricted to party activists and sympathizers
_ dubious, since the PRI does not even have a complete list of
members _ the ballot will be open to all registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates must win as many as possible of 300 electoral
districts of roughly equal size, forcing them to spread their
efforts evenly around the country.
</P>
<P>
   There will be limits on campaign spending and on television and
radio time. Those hopefuls who are already littering the airwaves
must now desist until Aug. 1, when the 14-week campaign begins.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, few people doubt that Zedillo favors one man in
particular: Francisco Labastida, his 56-year-old interior minister,
who this week resigned his job and announced his candidacy. Like
the president, he is from the PRI's reformist, free-market wing.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, suggests Joy Langston, a political scientist at CIDE,
a Mexico City graduate school, as a protege of the president,
Labastida might be more likely to protect Zedillo from the
opprobrium that some recent Mexican presidents have faced after
their terms ended.
</P>
<P>
   But Labastida trails in most opinion polls, and faces a powerful
challenge from traditionalists, such as Roberto Madrazo, the
governor of Tabasco state, who has led two recent polls, and Manuel
Bartlett, until recently the governor of Puebla. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 600. OPTIONAL MATERIAL CONTINUES) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   How can Zedillo help his man? The rules are not perfect. The
primary will be supervised not by an independent body, but by a PRI
committee under Fernando Gutierrez Barrios, a former interior
minister and wily master of the old game.
</P>
<P>
   The spending limits, and how they will be enforced, are still
matters to be decided; at any rate, their details remain
unannounced.
</P>
<P>
   And for all of Mexico's undeniable moves towards full democracy,
claims of overspending, ballot-rigging and vote-buying still dog
almost every local election. Even the left-wing Party of the
Democratic Revolution, which makes most such claims, was last month
riven by charges of foul play in its internal leadership contest.
</P>
<P>
   But the PRI knows its election must be seen to be free of all
visible manipulation. Even so, Zedillo is not quite fingerless.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's long tradition of one-party rule has endowed the
central government with myriad ways of getting local politicians
and trade unions to mobilize their supporters. And Zedillo himself
has been working behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   He invited both Bartlett and Madrazo for coffee last week.
Earlier this month Miguel Aleman, governor of the state of
Veracruz, popped over for breakfast and stayed four hours.
</P>
<P>
   Aleman drew support from all wings of the party. And on May 19,
he announced that he would not be running (as did Esteban
Moctezuma, like Labastida a modernizer).
</P>
<P>
   What was agreed over breakfast is unclear. But one of Aleman's
advisers believes that he will use his influence both in public
(his father and namesake was a still-remembered president) and in
private (he is a hugely rich and well-connected businessman as well
as governor) in favor of Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   That would strengthen Zedillo's favorite enormously. And all
within the rules of the game. After all, they say nothing about
using your fingers at breakfast. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexico this week launched a new game. It is one
the whole family, indeed the whole country, will enjoy, and may
even take a small part in. All the main players must follow the
rules; or if they do not, they must at least pretend to do so
convincingly.
</P>
<P>
   And the lucky winner will end up as president of Mexico _ maybe.
</P>
<P>
   The game is the presidential nomination of the Institutional
Revolutionary Party (PRI).
</P>
<P>
   For six of the PRI's seven decades in power that has been a
rather strange contest, since it has always involved only one
player _ the incumbent president _ and only one rule: the president
would choose the candidate, who would then duly succeed, either
because the people voted for him, or because the electoral
commission (which is to say the government) said they had.
</P>
<P>
   Now the electoral commission is independent, and the PRI can no
longer take victory for granted.
</P>
<P>
   In an election in 1997, it lost its majority in Congress for the
first time. Even so, the PRI may still win next year's presidential
race, but to do so it must avoid splits.
</P>
<P>
   Recent state elections have highlighted that risk. Where the
party has held primaries, and done so cleanly, it has gone on to
win the state governorship.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, it has sometimes had problems: on three occasions,
state elections have been won for the opposition by PRI renegades
denied their party's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Such experiences seem to have persuaded President Ernesto
Zedillo and the PRI's bigwigs of the need for radical change in the
presidential-nomination game.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo hinted at this last year, famously promising to end the
traditional selection method known as the dedazo, or
finger-pointing, by saying ``I will cut off my finger.''
</P>
<P>
   But when in March he suggested a primary-election system similar
to that in the United States, with votes staggered over several
months, skeptics reckoned that would let him secure a commanding
lead for his favored candidate by choosing which states would hold
early ballots.
</P>
<P>
   ``One must not forget that hands have ten fingers,'' said Jesus
Silva-Herzog, himself passed over for the presidency in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The rules announced on May 17 amputate several more fingers, as
Silva-Herzog conceded. The whole country will vote in a single
primary on Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being restricted to party activists and sympathizers
_ dubious, since the PRI does not even have a complete list of
members _ the ballot will be open to all registered voters.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates must win as many as possible of 300 electoral
districts of roughly equal size, forcing them to spread their
efforts evenly around the country.
</P>
<P>
   There will be limits on campaign spending and on television and
radio time. Those hopefuls who are already littering the airwaves
must now desist until Aug. 1, when the 14-week campaign begins.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, few people doubt that Zedillo favors one man in
particular: Francisco Labastida, his 56-year-old interior minister,
who this week resigned his job and announced his candidacy. Like
the president, he is from the PRI's reformist, free-market wing.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, suggests Joy Langston, a political scientist at CIDE,
a Mexico City graduate school, as a protege of the president,
Labastida might be more likely to protect Zedillo from the
opprobrium that some recent Mexican presidents have faced after
their terms ended.
</P>
<P>
   But Labastida trails in most opinion polls, and faces a powerful
challenge from traditionalists, such as Roberto Madrazo, the
governor of Tabasco state, who has led two recent polls, and Manuel
Bartlett, until recently the governor of Puebla. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 600. OPTIONAL MATERIAL CONTINUES) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   How can Zedillo help his man? The rules are not perfect. The
primary will be supervised not by an independent body, but by a PRI
committee under Fernando Gutierrez Barrios, a former interior
minister and wily master of the old game.
</P>
<P>
   The spending limits, and how they will be enforced, are still
matters to be decided; at any rate, their details remain
unannounced.
</P>
<P>
   And for all of Mexico's undeniable moves towards full democracy,
claims of overspending, ballot-rigging and vote-buying still dog
almost every local election. Even the left-wing Party of the
Democratic Revolution, which makes most such claims, was last month
riven by charges of foul play in its internal leadership contest.
</P>
<P>
   But the PRI knows its election must be seen to be free of all
visible manipulation. Even so, Zedillo is not quite fingerless.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico's long tradition of one-party rule has endowed the
central government with myriad ways of getting local politicians
and trade unions to mobilize their supporters. And Zedillo himself
has been working behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   He invited both Bartlett and Madrazo for coffee last week.
Earlier this month Miguel Aleman, governor of the state of
Veracruz, popped over for breakfast and stayed four hours.
</P>
<P>
   Aleman drew support from all wings of the party. And on May 19,
he announced that he would not be running (as did Esteban
Moctezuma, like Labastida a modernizer).
</P>
<P>
   What was agreed over breakfast is unclear. But one of Aleman's
advisers believes that he will use his influence both in public
(his father and namesake was a still-remembered president) and in
private (he is a hugely rich and well-connected businessman as well
as governor) in favor of Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   That would strengthen Zedillo's favorite enormously. And all
within the rules of the game. After all, they say nothing about
using your fingers at breakfast. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the more odious things about modern presidential politics
is the attempt to create ``character'' by injecting what
screenwriters like to call ``backstory.''
</P>
<P>
   Already the Republican Party is rewriting the life of George W.
Bush into the Texan equivalent of ``Henry V,'' a responsible young
king emerging from a misspent youth.
</P>
<P>
   Now Al Gore, apparently panicking that his spinners have not
woven enough tales of their own, has recreated himself as the
father of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   No such antics for the man probably lying in third place, Bill
Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   After several days trailing after him in New Hampshire, a
frustrated group of reporters, desperate for even the smallest
personal detail, asked the former senator to name his favorite
book. ``I'd rather not go down that road,'' came the slightly
mumbled reply.
</P>
<P>
   This is odd because, with the possible exception of John McCain,
a Republican senator who was once a prisoner of war in Vietnam,
Bradley has more backstory than anybody else in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Born in a small Missouri town, the son of a banker, the lanky
young man with huge hands first achieved fame by leading the
American basketball team to victory over the Russians at the 1964
Olympics. Then he became a New York Knick.
</P>
<P>
   A Rhodes scholar and a Princeton graduate, he wrote an
intelligent book about being on the road with the Knicks and then,
as if to prove his seriousness, married a professor of comparative
literature (something it is hard to imagine Dennis Rodman doing).
</P>
<P>
   Turning to politics, he represented New Jersey in the Senate for
18 years, fending off several pleas to run for president.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 he resigned his seat, declaring politics to be
``broken,'' took up some teaching posts, earned several million
dollars from consulting and wrote more worthy books. Now he has
reappeared from this period of reflection, saying he is ready for
the main job.
</P>
<P>
   This is the sort of hinterland that Bush or Gore would love. Yet
Bradley refuses to discuss his private life.
</P>
<P>
   He occasionally mentions long-dead relations, such as a racist
aunt, and he often starts with a lame joke about basketball. But he
is reluctant to do ``hoops'' for the cameras, and his living family
is kept resolutely off-limits.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is this some act. His decades as a star seem to have left
him with a gentlemanly reserve that in other countries might be
described as aristocratic.
</P>
<P>
   There is no shortage of people in New Jersey who have known him
for a long time, trust him, but still do not understand him.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what sort of friends one might meet chez Bradley, one
close adviser immediately answers that he has never been to the
house _ ``except of course on business.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is equally unrevealing about his ideas. In terms of
voting records, there is not much to choose between him and Gore.
But, while the vice-president seems to have positions aplenty,
Bradley insists that he is still in the listening stage of his
campaign; the policies will come later.
</P>
<P>
   The media too are having to wait. The talk shows have been
turned down so often that they have given up calling.
</P>
<P>
   As for segments on the nightly news, he may not be a worse
public speaker than Gore, but his speeches remain idiosyncratically
empty of soundbites. One shudders to think what his television
commercials will be like.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bradley's own form of anti-politics seems to be doing pretty
well. Some polls show him catching up with Gore. The Republicans
have started running background checks on him.
</P>
<P>
   Despite limiting himself to individual contributions of no more
than $1,000, he is on course to raise around $20 million _ enough
to give Gore a fight. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (200-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 650) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this prominence owes quite a lot to luck: if any
other Democrat had chosen to challenge Gore, Bradley would not be
the sole repository of anti-Gore feeling. Purely by turning up, he
has put himself in the semifinals of the competition to be
president.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in New Hampshire at least, the evidence is slightly more
than just good fortune: in nursing homes, companies and schools,
Bradley seems to be clicking with his listeners, an alarming number
of whom, from Gore's point of view, have already met the
vice-president.
</P>
<P>
   One common theory has it that even if Bradley does well in
small, rich, well-educated New Hampshire, he will follow the path
of other ideas-politicians, such as Gary Hart and Paul Tsongas, and
be crucified once the race becomes more televisual.
</P>
<P>
   That may be likely, but it is not inevitable. Hart and Tsongas
were both knocked out of their primaries by Democrats with more of
a common touch than Gore.
</P>
<P>
   And this time New York and California, two huge states where
Bradley seems to be doing well, hold their primaries much earlier
than in previous years. Momentum could count for a lot. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But only if Bradley says a little bit more about where he
stands. There is a limit to how many times you can host debates
about Social Security or education without saying what you will do
about them; you also need some ideas of your own.
</P>
<P>
   Two of his pet issues may come in handy. Campaign-finance reform
is a sly way of embarrassing Gore. The quest for racial
understanding, a perennial Bradley theme, looks more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   In his favor, he has in his pocket a check for $1,000 from
Michael Jordan and a long record of standing up for blacks (a
constituency Clinton is supposed to deliver to Gore).
</P>
<P>
   Yet his focus often seems two-tone rather than multicolored.
During a keynote speech on race at Phillips Exeter Academy, one
young Asian listener went to sleep ``because he wasn't saying
anything about me.'' She still went to get his autograph at the
end.
</P>
<P>
   In states like California, non-black minorities may be less
forgiving.
</P>
<P>
   However, the real thing that Bradley will eventually have to
reveal is himself. That does not mean discussing on ``Oprah''
whether he wears boxers or briefs: after Bill Clinton, many
Americans will yearn for a president with some degree of reserve.
But it does mean saying, at least, what books you read.
</P>
<P>
   For all his decency and intelligence, there is a lurking
suspicion that Bradley is a bit of an odd fish. Some doubts seem
trivial. Why, for instance, did he seem to lose all interest in
basketball once he stopped playing? Others are immense.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, he still has not fully explained why exactly he
is running for president. &QL;

   However, the real thing that Bradley will eventually have to
reveal is himself. That does not mean discussing on ``Oprah''
whether he wears boxers or briefs: after Bill Clinton, many
Americans will yearn for a president with some degree of reserve.
But it does mean saying, at least, what books you read.
</P>
<P>
   For all his decency and intelligence, there is a lurking
suspicion that Bradley is a bit of an odd fish. Some doubts seem
trivial. Why, for instance, did he seem to lose all interest in
basketball once he stopped playing? Others are immense.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, he still has not fully explained why exactly he
is running for president. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT _ The day NATO started bombing Yugoslavia, Arab
newspapers, like European and American ones, carried banner
headlines about the raids.
</P>
<P>
   But on the editorial pages the view was generally very
different: whereas NATO's leaders seemed to expect praise from
Muslim Arabs for the defense of their co-religionists in Kosovo,
they earned mainly rebukes for sidestepping the United Nations and
``taking the law into their own hands.''
</P>
<P>
   One columnist in a London-based Arabic daily claimed that ``the
present offensive against Serbia shows that NATO is determined to
strip the international community of its power.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Muslims in the Middle East do, of course, sympathize with
the Kosovars. Any Egyptians, Syrians, Jordanians and Sudanese who
paid attention at school remember that it was Albanian converts to
Islam _ such as Muhammad Ali, a 19th-century pasha of Egypt _ who
once ruled their countries.
</P>
<P>
   On airliners, in schools, at mosques and on the street, many
Arabs have been digging deeply into their pockets for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The bejewelled ladies of a Kuwaiti women's group sent a
planeload of aid, and the poorer citizens of Sidon, in Lebanon,
have been throwing banknotes onto sheets carried through the
streets by a local Islamic group.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Crescent, the Muslim world's equivalent of the Red
Cross, has set up refugee camps in both Macedonia and Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Governments, especially in the rich Gulf Arab states, are also
doing their bit on the humanitarian front. The United Arab
Emirates, famously, has set up a ``five-star camp,'' complete with
satellite telephones, security guards and its own airstrip.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has
complained that the camp is so luxurious that its occupants are
reluctant to move on to longer-term accommodation, well-wishers in
the Emirates insist that three hot meals a day and spotless loos
are the least the Kosovars deserve after their ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to what NATO is doing, most Arab governments
sing a different tune.
</P>
<P>
   Unsurprisingly, countries like Libya and Iraq came out quickly
in support of Yugoslavia, no doubt seeing a prospective new member
of the rogue-states club. But among the West's allies in the region
only the Emirates has offered to send troops as peacekeepers _
though not, even then, as part of a NATO-led force.
</P>
<P>
   Others, such as Saudi Arabia and Egypt, have mumbled platitudes
about ending aggression, but little more.
</P>
<P>
   Why the reluctance to applaud action designed to get the
Kosovars back to their homes?
</P>
<P>
   In part, after the West's pretty ineffectual bombing of Iraq, a
lot of Arabs fear that NATO will just make a mess of it: many Arab
officials agree with Saddam Hussein that the weapons the western
powers ``use to scare the world are incapable of changing things.''
</P>
<P>
   In part, they fear setting a precedent that might come back to
haunt them. Four Arab countries _ Lebanon, Libya, Sudan and Iraq _
have been the targets of American bombs, shells or missiles in the
past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Even Israel's foreign minister, Ariel Sharon, has expressed some
misgivings, presumably hoping to be heard by the Palestinians of
the West Bank and Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In part, Middle Eastern governments simply do not want to stir
up those of their citizens who tend to get angrier about what NATO
does than about Serb atrocities.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there have been street protests against the
Serbs, notably in Lebanon and the Palestinian territories, two
parts of the Middle East where people know what it is like to be
ejected from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Editorials all across the region complain that Arab governments
are standing idly by. In the popular view, the Kosovars' plight
calls for intervention by the United Nations or by Muslim
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Few Arabs trust NATO's claim to be acting out of concern for the
Kosovars. Some say that NATO is flexing its muscles merely to let
the world know who is boss.
</P>
<P>
   Others suggest that it knew its bombing would speed up the
Serbs' ethnic-cleansing campaign, and so rid Europe of Muslims; and
that the attacks on Christian Serbia are just a way of softening up
Muslim opinion for the next blitz on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   Discussion of the issue is not exactly calm. The one Muslim
country in the region where reactions have been relatively
enthusiastic is non-Arab Turkey.
</P>
<P>
   The Turks, who conquered Kosovo in the 14th century and
abandoned the local converts to Islam when they retreated in the
19th century, feel strongly about their historical, religious and
cultural ties to the Kosovars.
</P>
<P>
   No fewer than 3 million Turks, including many influential
politicians and businessmen, are of Albanian descent.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Turkey _ a NATO member _ itself has a less
than spotless record with minorities: its Armenians suffered hugely
during the First World War, and the Kurdish part of the country has
been having a rough time for years past.
</P>
<P>
   So most of Turkey's generals and politicians are happy to stand
by NATO, especially when Greece is being less enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   The Turks have put their aircraft into the bombing campaign, and
their bases at NATO's disposal, no doubt hoping that in return
their NATO partners will now nag them a bit less about Turkey's own
current problems with its Kurds and its Islamists. &QL;

DODGERS FALL TO CARDINALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Inconsistent: not consistent; lacking agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Also see, Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   They will look like the $80 million ballclub of destruction on
one night. They will self-destruct and give the impression of being
one of the more thrifty ballclubs on another night.
</P>
<P>
   There is no rhyme. No reason. No explanation and no way to know
which is coming.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers suffered their fifth loss in six games, dropping a
10-6 decision to the St. Louis Cardinals before a sellout crowd of
53,683 Friday at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers left fielder Gary Sheffield had two homers and three
RBI. So did St. Louis' Ray Lankford.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers trailed 6-1 in the sixth inning before rallying to
pull within a run. The most significant thing the Dodgers offense
did was get St. Louis starter Juan Acevedo to his pitch count by
the end of the fifth inning. He left after throwing 78 pitches (48
strikes).
</P>
<P>
   In came Mike Mohler, though only for a brief, ineffective spell,
as the Dodgers tried to come back. Switch-hitting catcher Todd
Hundley got his first hit from the right side this season in 10
at-bats to score Eric Young and move Beltre to third. Eric Karros
singled in Beltre and Devon White looped a single to center to
score Hundley and make it 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Mohler gave way to Rick Croushore, who got Mark Grudzielanek to
line to center on his first pitch to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   But the momentum gained for the three-run inning was abruptly
lost in the seventh when Fernando Tatis hit Masaoka's 2-1 pitch
over the right field fence for his 12th homer of the season and a
7-4 St. Louis lead.
</P>
<P>
   Croushore allowed a one-out walk to Eric Young. Two batters
later Sheffield hit a two-run homer just inside the left field foul
pole to make it 7-6. It was the third time this season Sheffield
has hit two homers in a game.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cardinals' inability to hold a big lead also rubbed off
on the Dodgers' bullpen's inability to keep it close, or vice
versa.
</P>
<P>
   Newly acquired reliever Doug Bochtler gave the two runs back in
the eighth when Lankford hit a two-run homer to right-center to
push the Cardinals' lead to 9-6.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals added a run in the top of the ninth on Joe
McEwing's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals had beaten the Dodgers four times in the six
previous meetings this season, and did it without the aid of Mark
McGwire's long ball. McGwire still hadn't homered at Chavez Ravine,
but it matters not when the rest of the Cardinals are battering
Dodgers pitching.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the worst sign of the night, though, was when the crowd
vehemently booed the Dodgers. Not because they committed four
errors in the first seven innings _ three by third baseman Adrian
Beltre _ or because their play was lackluster once again.
</P>
<P>
   No, the jeers came when reliever Onan Masaoka intentionally
walked McGwire in the sixth with runners on second and third and
two outs.
</P>
<P>
   Lost in the glitz and glamour and anticipation of a McGwire home
run is that the Dodgers were shutdown by a stopgap starter who was
pummeled in two innings in his last start _ against the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Acevedo, who allowed four runs on five hits in two innings last
Sunday in St. Louis, allowed one hit in five innings. It was a
Sheffield home run to left that gave the Dodgers a glimmer of hope
in the fourth inning as they pulled to within 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   While Acevedo was dazzling, Dodgers right-hander Ismael Valdes
was dreadful in what turned out to be his shortest outing of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes allowed six runs on six hits in 41/3 innings. He also
walked two and was hurt by three errors that led to a pair of
unearned runs.
</P>
<P>
   But after Sheffield's homer, the Cardinals came right back with
two runs in the top of the fifth, knocking Valdes out in the
process. Darren Bragg and Edgar Renteria began the inning with
singles and McGwire scored Bragg with a sacrifice fly to center.
Valdes hit Lankford, who hit his first homer earlier, with a pitch
and walked Tatis to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers manager Davey Johnson saw enough and pulled Valdes for
Mike Maddux, who walked Eric Davis to force in a run and put the
Cardinals ahead 6-1. Maddux got out of the inning with a double
play.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' rally was necessitated by Valdes' ineffectiveness
early on. It began when Lankford, who homered off closer Jeff Shaw
in Sunday's win in the Midwest, led off the second with a solo
homer.
</P>
<P>
   Tatis singled, Beltre committed his first error on Davis'
grounder and Eli Marrero singled to load the bases. McEwing's
sacrifice fly gave the Cardinals a 2-0 lead and with two outs Bragg
singled to right to score two as St. Louis went ahead 4-0.

KRIEGER WINS GRAND AMERICAN RACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRWINDALE, Calif. _ Ron Nava's Chevrolet slammed into the first
turn coming off lap three in Friday's NASCAR Grand American
Modified's race at Irwindale Speedway, causing a 15-minute delay in
front of the brave 2,742 on a chilly night.
</P>
<P>
   It only got worse from there, Rip Michels' Chevrolet blew a tire
after the second turn of lap five. He turned onto the infield, but
hit a parked ambulance, causing a second caution and extra delay.
</P>
<P>
   After the ambulance was towed away, Larry Krieger assumed the
lead following lap six and pulled away in his Chevrolet to win the
Grand American race, well ahead of second place finisher Rod
Johnson in the delay-shortened 25-lap race on the 1/2 mile track.
</P>
<P>
   Krieger, who led Johnson in the NASCAR point standings heading
in, increased his lead to 284-258 over Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson looked like he would challenge Krieger in laps nine
through 12, trying each time to pass Krieger on the inside of turn
four, but Krieger held him off each time.
</P>
<P>
   TK Karvasek captured the Super Stock race, winning the other
delayed-shortened feature over second place finisher John Vitale in
the 25 lap race, originally scheduled for 40 laps.
</P>
<P>
   In the Legends division, Escondido's Seth Hicks tried to squeeze
by leader Mike Cass in the final lap (25), but Hicks knocked Cass
into John occasions's car, causing Cass and occasions to slam into
the wall coming off turn three.
</P>
<P>
   Hicks, who led most of the race before being passed by Cass in
lap 22, was moved to last for causing the accident, allowing
Riverside's Ron Anderson to capture the Legends race. Covina's
Jimmy White finished second, 1.682 behind Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   White, who started in fourth position, took a quick lead coming
off turn four of the opening lap, passing Cass. He held that lead
for the next couple laps, holding off Cass on two occassions, but
Cass finally reclaimed the lead in lap six as White dropped to
fourth. White maintained that position throughout before being
moved to second after the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Both Cass and occasions appeared to come out of the accident in
good shape.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-lap Mini Stock race around the 1/3 mile track was
captured by Thousand Oak's Lee Ladd, who started in fourth
position. Ladd trailed second place finisher Scott Porter heading
into lap seven -- but that's where the race changed for good.
</P>
<P>
   Bellflower's Terry Limberopoulous tried to pass both Ladd and
Porter in lap seven coming off the fourth turn and entering the
front straight, but Limberopoulous spun out, clearing the way for
Ladd to sneak pass Porter to take the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Ladd was never challenged since, finishing in a time of
6:06.064. Porter finished .872 behind Ladd.

DODGERS FALL TO CARDINALS

By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Inconsistent: not consistent; lacking agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Also see, Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   They will look like the $80 million ballclub of destruction on
one night. They will self-destruct and give the impression of being
one of the more thrifty ballclubs on another night.
</P>
<P>
   There is no rhyme. No reason. No explanation. No way to know
which is coming.
</P>
<P>
   The bad came Friday against St. Louis in a 10-6 loss to the
Cardinals before a sellout crowd of 53,683 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The fifth loss in six games for the stumbling Dodgers (21-20)
was a clinic in how not pitch, beginning with starter Ismael Valdes
and going through reliever Doug Bochtler.
</P>
<P>
   Every time the Dodgers scored to pull within striking distance
after falling behind 6-1 in the fifth inning, the Cardinals
answered in the next inning to provide a cushion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't win them all,'' Valdes said. ``Once in a while
you're going to have these kinds of games in the season. I'd rather
have them early than later on.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' bullpen was summoned early because Valdes (4-2)
lasted only 41/3 innings _ his shortest outing of the season and
the first time he failed to pitch into the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   But Onan Masaoka and Bochtler allowed four runs on four hits in
four innings. Mike Maddux walked in a run before getting out of a
bases-loaded jam with a double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to make bad pitches, but we're going to make more
good pitches than bad pitches in the end,'' said Masaoka, who
allowed a solo homer to Fernando Tatis in the seventh inning. ``We
put up six runs. Our team is going to hit for us. As a pitcher, and
I know everyone else will do the same, I'm going to try my best.
Once in a while we're going to make some bad pitches. We have to
come back from that.''
</P>
<P>
   Even what the Dodgers did offensively was matched or bettered by
St. Louis, which has won five of the seven games between the clubs
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers left fielder Gary Sheffield hit two homers and drove in
three runs, but Cardinals left fielder Ray Lankford also smacked
two homers and had three RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Darren Bragg paced a 10-hit St. Louis attack with four hits and
stole one of seven bases against Dodgers pitchers and catcher Todd
Hundley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many fastballs over the plate,'' Johnson said. ``I don't
want anybody getting down. It's discouraging when our pitching
isn't more consistent.''
</P>
<P>
   It was ugly all around as the Dodgers committed four errors _
three of which were by third baseman Adrian Beltre, though he was
only discredited with two. Inexplicably, first baseman Eric Karros
was given an error when he couldn't dig Beltre's throw out of the
dirt in the fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Beltre's other two errors led to a pair of unearned runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beltre had a rough night,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson
said. ``He had three errors. Brooks Robinson had three errors in
one night, too. It's just part of the learning experience. He was
aggressive after (the third) one.''
</P>
<P>
   After trailing 6-1 in the sixth inning the Dodgers got the tying
run to the plate, thanks partly to the still-developing role of St.
Louis' Juan Acevedo. Making his second start of the season, Acevedo
(3-1) was limited to 78 pitches (48 strikes) in five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Before giving way to an equally inept Cardinals bullpen, Acevedo
dominated. The only hit he allowed was Sheffield's solo homer in
the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   After that, everything seemed to be a gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Struggling for any kind of offense, the Dodgers got successive
RBI singles from Hundley, Karros and Devon White to pull within 6-4
in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   But the momentum gained was abruptly lost in the seventh when
Tatis hit his 12th homer of the season to stake St. Louis to a 7-4
lead.
</P>
<P>
   In the bottom of the inning Cardinals reliever Rick Croushore
allowed a one-out walk to Eric Young and two batters later
Sheffield hit a two-run homer just inside the left-field foul pole
to make it 7-6. It was the third time this season Sheffield has hit
two homers in a game.
</P>
<P>
   No matter, because the recently acquired Bochtler gave the two
runs back in the eighth when Lankford hit a two-run homer to push
the Cardinals' lead to 9-6.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals added a run in the top of the ninth on Joe
McEwing's sacrifice fly but Manny Aybar allowed a leadoff double to
Mark Grudzielanek and walked Dave Hansen to start the ninth before
pitching out of trouble for his first save.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept scoring but we couldn't stop them from scoring,''
Valdes said. ``It was one of those nights. I don't know what it
was. I was feeling good before the game.''

HEYDAY OF STOCK MUTUAL FUNDS MAY BE IN JEOPARDY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- For a decade, mutual funds have been the nation's
hottest investing trend. Invented in Boston more than 70 years ago
and enshrined in the 1990s as America's investment of choice, funds
have created wealth for everyone from ordinary citizens to
corporate money giants such as Fidelity Investments.
</P>
<P>
   But the product that brought investing to the masses and helped
Americans save for college and retirement faces new challenges. In
part beguiled by on-line trading and the fresh allure of individual
stocks, in part annoyed by a volatile Wall Street whose highs have
rewarded only the happy few, investors have been putting less money
into stock mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
   After years of unimpeded expansion, the fund industry is bracing
for a slower rate of growth and stiffer competition. In Boston,
where one-quarter of the country's $5.5 trillion fund business is
concentrated and money management is a bulwark of the Massachusetts
economy, the changes have special resonance.
</P>
<P>
   If recent slower sales trends persist, ``it's going to slow down
growth in a very fast-growing industry,'' said Kevin McIntyre, a
senior economist at RFA/Dismal Sciences, a market research firm in
West Chester, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   The recent shift in investor habits suggests at least in part a
rejection of the principle of professional money management, a
foundation of the traditional fund industry. The change also
recalls an era when stocks were America's favorite investment,
before mutual funds took off in the 1980s. And it underscores the
spread of a transaction mentality _ the hallmark of traditional and
cyber brokerages _ across a nation of investors formed under an
ethos of long-term investing.
</P>
<P>
   One might argue that the fund industry has become a victim of
its own success. Investors who made money off mutual funds in
recent years now have so much extra cash they are pursuing the next
hottest thing _ shares in Internet companies. Jeremiah Potts,
director of marketing and communications at MFS Investment
Management of Boston, called the straying from funds and fresh
focus on Web-related stocks ``the result of a market peaking and
simple greed kicking in.''
</P>
<P>
   Or one could argue that the industry has faltered amid more
enticing, if riskier, investments. Many funds have not kept pace
with the broader market's returns, mostly because only a handful of
stocks _ generally blue chips or high-flying technology shares _
have performed well. That gap has led some irritated investors to
refrain from putting new cash into stock funds and instead try
on-line stock trading.
</P>
<P>
   Investors put a net $48.8 billion into equity funds so far this
year through May 20, nearly 40 percent less than a year ago,
according to Robert Adler of AMG Data Services, a firm in Arcata,
Calif., that tracks fund flows.
</P>
<P>
   The figure, which represents the amount investors put into stock
funds of all types minus the sums they pulled out, is still large
by historic standards. And the industry's total assets under
management are still increasing.
</P>
<P>
   But that growth has been caused mainly because of a rising stock
market, not new sales. Against that backdrop, the recent sales
numbers tell a complex tale of shifts in investor habits.
</P>
<P>
   While concerned about a recent drop in new cash coming into
stock funds, the workhouse of the mutual fund industry, most fund
executives are not quaking in their wingtips. Money management
firms earn the most from collecting fees for assets they oversee,
not selling new funds. So even when sales or stock markets slow
down, they still make money.
</P>
<P>
   While investors have put less cash into stock funds as a whole,
they have lavished money on a few types of funds. This year through
May 20, investors put a net $56.8 billion into large-company stock
funds, more than twice as much as in the year-ago period, according
to AMG. They sent $24 billion to funds that mimic indexes, a rise
of 70 percent from a year ago. And they poured cash into technology
funds _ $6.8 billion compared with net withdrawals of $400 million
a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Those figures are larger than the net $48.8 billion that equity
funds of all types scored because investors also withdrew tens of
billions of dollars from small-company, international, and other
funds. In fact, 297 domestic stock funds suffered net redemptions,
or withdrawals, last quarter, an increase of nearly 30 percent on
1998, according to Financial Research Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts point to a plethora of factors _ many of them
contradictory _ behind the overall slowdown in stock fund sales.
</P>
<P>
   Some think the nation's 73 million fund investors are more
afraid of the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Others, pointing out the stampede to Internet issues, see
investors as less afraid of the stock market and more willing to
take risks _ especially with the Dow Jones industrial average up 18
percent so far this year and near the 11,000 range.
</P>
<P>
   Some view investors as irritated by the underperformance of
mutual funds, whose managers have found it increasingly tough to
beat the broad market.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another theory says fund investors have been seduced by
on-line brokerages, which now number 9 million accounts and are
home to more than one-third of all retail stock trades, or
transactions made by individual investors, according to Gomez
Advisers Inc., a consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Potts said up to 15 percent of all investors who use financial
planners now think they can beat professional portfolio managers
with a do-it-yourself strategy of picking stocks _ especially those
whose names end in ``dot com.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason behind the slowdown in fund sales growth,
funds ``have clearly become more of a mature business,'' Potts
said, citing the industry's success this decade in reaching more
than one in three American households.
</P>
<P>
   That natural slowdown in growth, coupled with changing investor
habits, could affect the asset management industry in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Volatile cash flows from sales make it tougher for fund firms to
plan their businesses. McIntyre of RFA/Dismal Sciences forecast
jobs growth in the securities industry, which is predominantly
composed of fund firms, slowing to 7 1/2 percent this year and just
2 percent in 2000, after expansion of 8 percent and 9 percent in
the previous two years. While securities industry employees total
1.5 percent of the Boston area's work force, they account for 4
percent of the earnings, and thus spend more dollars in the local
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Like many fund executives, AMG's Adler sees investors eventually
coming back en masse to mutual funds as a broad investment
category. Like stock markets, he said, fund sales are cyclical.
``When a correction comes _ and it will,'' Adler said, ``people
will return to mutual funds for the purpose for which they were
created _ to have a professional manage your money.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Poor Al Gore. As if President Clinton's keening
that his loyal No. 2 needs to unbend were not enough, now the
Republicans have made Gore a punch line.
</P>
<P>
   Even Steve Forbes, a Republican presidential candidate not known
for flair, gets big laughs cracking wise about Gore's lack of
flair. ``Concerning Gore, I won't be giving him any advice today,''
Forbes deadpanned last week. ``He seems to be getting enough from
the White House.'' He then referred to the vice president's ``rigor
mortis.'' Both lines drew more cheers than anything Forbes said
about his new Social Security proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Nixon used to advise his proteges not to worry if they
were loved or despised. ``The worst sin in politics,'' he once
said, ``is being boring.''
</P>
<P>
   From money to the entire White House infrastructure to
on-the-job experience, Gore has more advantages than any candidate
for president today. Yet polls show that his support in the
primaries is less than enthusiastic, and that he would get
clobbered in a general election by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas or
Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Why? The vice president is boring. The American people, in
polls, say so. Leno and Letterman say so. Even his mentor, Clinton,
says so. Gore tried to turn his weakness into a strength, by making
self-deprecating jokes, but the boring schtick was boring.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's fate will depend on a question that is as yet
unanswerable. After the vertiginous, long-running Clinton sitcom,
will Americans want more presidential high jinks? Or will they want
a respite from it all? Will voters want a leader focusing intensely
on them, or will they just want to be left alone to play the stock
market? No one, after all, is more gratifyingly boring than Alan
Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Podesta, a Democratic strategist, said that after sampling
years with Clinton, voters may want calm. ``People go to amusement
parks and like roller coasters,'' he said. ``At the same time, they
appreciate the straight and narrow.''
</P>
<P>
   If America wants bland, Al Gore is the man. Many of the hottest
politicians these days are the coldest. The appropriately named
Gray Davis chastised reporters last year for wanting a candidate
``who could be a replacement for Jay Leno.'' Three months later,
Davis, a Democrat, was elected governor of California. Now he calls
himself Gore's ``charisma adviser.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, of course, the determinedly dull governor of New York,
George Pataki, who invites critics to compare him with his
predecessor, Mario Cuomo, the compelling Democratic orator.
``There's a big difference between glitz and substance and rhetoric
and reality,'' Pataki said. ``If you look at my predecessor, there
was nobody who was better able to give a speech. But he was not as
able to change a government.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's friends still respond, perhaps reflexively, to queries
about the very vertical vice president with a query of their own:
``When were you last out with him? He's changed.'' They insist that
the dullness quotient is way overstated. They say Gore can be
surprisingly engaging, even robust, in small settings when the
cameras aren't around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't Al Gore's people understand?'' asked Mandy Grunwald,
a media consultant who is advising Hillary Rodham Clinton.
``Instead of bemoaning the fact that he's not Clinton, celebrate
it. People want the substance of the Clinton-Gore years without the
soap opera.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Gore's advisers are beginning to agree. ``Boring is good
because it means reliable,'' said Marla Romash, a Gore adviser who
for years has defended Gore's campaign skills. ``It means someone
who's going to get the job done. It means someone who's going to
stay focused.'' Gore's advisers argue that he has been so
overshadowed by the president that people have not had a chance to
get to know him.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, blandness comes in as many flavors as Ben &AMP; Jerry's.
In Gore's case, it means a candidate who is uninspiring and
sometimes awkward with voters (a telltale sign _ he doesn't know
quite what to do with a baby.) His lone rival, former Sen. Bill
Bradley, has some provocative ideas, but can be prone to deliver
them in a lifeless monotone. He almost seems to dislike
interruptions for applause.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the mix of fizz and bland policies is a winning
combination. One explanation for why Bush is the early favorite for
the Republican nomination may be that he knows how to charm voters.
(A recent Washington Post/ABC News Poll found 56 percent of voters
viewed Gore as somewhat or very boring; only 23 percent said that
of Bush.) But on policy matters, Bush has tried to sit on his lead
and appeal to the widest electorate possible by being
nonprovocative.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, despite Clinton's piquant reputation, some of his
best points came when he tried to make politics and ideology as
bland as possible, as when he pressed for school uniforms in the
1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``People used to say to me _ I'm not sure to my face _ that I
was kind of dull,'' said Michael Dukakis, the Democratic
presidential nominee in 1988 and three-term governor of
Massachusetts, who sympathizes with Gore. ``I would say, `You don't
get re-elected three times because you're dull.'''
</P>
<P>
   Noting the extraordinary oratorical skills of Presidents Reagan
and Clinton, he added, ``If you're going to judge the rest of us by
these two guys, then we'll all be in sad shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes blandness comes in cycles. In New York, voters picked
the peppery Ed Koch as mayor. Then they opted for David Dinkins
(bland) and then Rudolph Giuliani (highly spiced).
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rise of politicians like Pataki and Davis, there
still is some appetite for sizzle. In the contest for Minnesota
governor last year, the professional wrestler Jesse ``the Body''
Ventura defeated Hubert Humphrey III who, unlike his father, is
hardly a live wire.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over personality is important because voters often
look to politicians, specifically presidents, to inspire and to
lead. This is the television age, after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Straightforward is OK but boring is never in,'' said Patrick
Caddell, a pollster for President Jimmy Carter. ``We're talking
about the presidency. They don't want Bill Clinton back, this wild,
out-of-control thing. But to say if you're a wooden Indian that's
OK, that's overstating it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview in Austin, Texas, Bush, who has the
raffish charm of Bill Clinton, declined to discuss Gore's political
skills. Yet he made the case for a president who connects with
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to know you care,'' he said. ``People want to know
you relate. People want to see you in action. That's really
important, particularly in early states where retail politics can
affect the outcome of the election. People know if you're
uncomfortable around them. People know if you don't like them.
People are smart.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even if Gore buys the idea that bland is beautiful, he should
not expect it to carry him to the White House. Sen. Richard Lugar,
R-Ind., who was considered so bland that he was passed over for Dan
Quayle as George Bush's running mate in 1988, tried to turn his
seriousness into an asset in the 1996 presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his commercials, Lugar spoke earnestly as a photograph
of Clinton, Gore and Jim Belushi, in sunglasses and fedoras,
mugging as the Blues Brothers, flashed on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presidency is serious business,'' Lugar said, very
seriously. ``The president is not entertainment. The president is
commander in chief.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters, however, did not take Lugar seriously at all. He was
soon out of the race, saying he had no interest in ``competing
endlessly with no prospects.''

<P>
   Maybe Gore's advisers are beginning to agree. ``Boring is good
because it means reliable,'' said Marla Romash, a Gore adviser who
for years has defended Gore's campaign skills. ``It means someone
who's going to get the job done. It means someone who's going to
stay focused.'' Gore's advisers argue that he has been so
overshadowed by the president that people have not had a chance to
get to know him.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, blandness comes in as many flavors as Ben &AMP; Jerry's.
In Gore's case, it means a candidate who is uninspiring and
sometimes awkward with voters (a telltale sign _ he doesn't know
quite what to do with a baby.) His lone rival, former Sen. Bill
Bradley, has some provocative ideas, but can be prone to deliver
them in a lifeless monotone. He almost seems to dislike
interruptions for applause.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the mix of fizz and bland policies is a winning
combination. One explanation for why Bush is the early favorite for
the Republican nomination may be that he knows how to charm voters.
(A recent Washington Post/ABC News Poll found 56 percent of voters
viewed Gore as somewhat or very boring; only 23 percent said that
of Bush.) But on policy matters, Bush has tried to sit on his lead
and appeal to the widest electorate possible by being
nonprovocative.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, despite Clinton's piquant reputation, some of his
best points came when he tried to make politics and ideology as
bland as possible, as when he pressed for school uniforms in the
1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``People used to say to me _ I'm not sure to my face _ that I
was kind of dull,'' said Michael Dukakis, the Democratic
presidential nominee in 1988 and three-term governor of
Massachusetts, who sympathizes with Gore. ``I would say, `You don't
get re-elected three times because you're dull.'''
</P>
<P>
   Noting the extraordinary oratorical skills of Presidents Reagan
and Clinton, he added, ``If you're going to judge the rest of us by
these two guys, then we'll all be in sad shape.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes blandness comes in cycles. In New York, voters picked
the peppery Ed Koch as mayor. Then they opted for David Dinkins
(bland) and then Rudolph Giuliani (highly spiced).
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rise of politicians like Pataki and Davis, there
still is some appetite for sizzle. In the contest for Minnesota
governor last year, the professional wrestler Jesse ``the Body''
Ventura defeated Hubert Humphrey III who, unlike his father, is
hardly a live wire.
</P>
<P>
   The debate over personality is important because voters often
look to politicians, specifically presidents, to inspire and to
lead. This is the television age, after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Straightforward is OK but boring is never in,'' said Patrick
Caddell, a pollster for President Jimmy Carter. ``We're talking
about the presidency. They don't want Bill Clinton back, this wild,
out-of-control thing. But to say if you're a wooden Indian that's
OK, that's overstating it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview in Austin, Texas, Bush, who has the
raffish charm of Bill Clinton, declined to discuss Gore's political
skills. Yet he made the case for a president who connects with
voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to know you care,'' he said. ``People want to know
you relate. People want to see you in action. That's really
important, particularly in early states where retail politics can
affect the outcome of the election. People know if you're
uncomfortable around them. People know if you don't like them.
People are smart.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Even if Gore buys the idea that bland is beautiful, he should
not expect it to carry him to the White House. Sen. Richard Lugar,
R-Ind., who was considered so bland that he was passed over for Dan
Quayle as George Bush's running mate in 1988, tried to turn his
seriousness into an asset in the 1996 presidential primaries.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his commercials, Lugar spoke earnestly as a photograph
of Clinton, Gore and Jim Belushi, in sunglasses and fedoras,
mugging as the Blues Brothers, flashed on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The presidency is serious business,'' Lugar said, very
seriously. ``The president is not entertainment. The president is
commander in chief.''
</P>
<P>
   Voters, however, did not take Lugar seriously at all. He was
soon out of the race, saying he had no interest in ``competing
endlessly with no prospects.''

   LONDON _ What was a British prime minister doing dressed down in
an open-neck shirt and short sleeves and sitting cross-legged and
shoeless in a refugee tent in Albania? And why was this leader of a
spent imperial power passing as much time this month in places like
Aachen, Bonn, Brussels, Bucharest, Chicago, Mons, Sofia, Skopje,
Tirana and Washington as in London?
</P>
<P>
   Through a combination of passion, stamina and focus, Prime
Minister Tony Blair has turned his look of concern into NATO's most
familiar face, and his sermonizing speech into the alliance's most
insistent voice, articulating in emotive language a moral
justification for the conflict over Kosovo and a demand for an
uncompromising solution to it.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, he is projecting a belligerent British view
across the English Channel onto a continent that Britain has long
treated warily, and across the Atlantic to a continent that it is
used to addressing more modestly.
</P>
<P>
   So far Blair's aggressiveness enjoys considerable support in
Britain, but it has provoked some strong opinions abroad. Most
notably, his lobbying last week for an augmented ground force that
would be prepared to enter Kosovo before any peace settlement
brought annoyed retorts from two allied leaders.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton told the prime minister during a 90-minute
trans-Atlantic phone call that Britain was fostering a dangerous
appearance of disunity between London and Washington, and Gerhard
Schroeder, the German chancellor, said flatly that Germany was
against the introduction of ground forces and would veto it in
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder added a line that left no doubt who he thought was out
of line: he described the alliance's disagreement as ``this
specifically British debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Blair's combative campaign a case of the old British Lion
getting its lusty roar back? Or does it reflect a wholly new
British assertiveness, from a self-described young modernizer
interested now in remodeling Britain's global role in the
attention-getting way that he has been reshaping its politics at
home? Or is it a bit of both, the old noble beast turned out in
eye-catching trappings from New Labor stylists?
</P>
<P>
   To Kenneth Minogue, professor emeritus of government at the
London School of Economics, Blair's campaign represents ``a
remarkably high level of personal diplomacy for us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Diana syndrome,'' he continued, ``a policy made by
image, the image of miserable refugees, not one made in terms of
long years of development.'' He said the 46-year-old leader's
tactics had put the British into ``a position of having to put up
or shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And the problem is we can't put up, and we won't shut up,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   John Keegan, the military historian, said he thought Blair's
populist brand of politics was no way to fight a war. ``Master
politician that he is,'' he said, ``he has no experience of
conducting the diplomatic or military side of war. He is running
terrible risks. Polls show that he has a majority of public
support, but it is the support of tabloid readers. The
well-informed feel uninformed, are anxious and racked by doubt.
Those who cheer him on do so in the spirit of football
supporters.''
</P>
<P>
   But Anthony King, professor of government at the University of
Essex, sees Blair's current conduct as squarely in the British
tradition. ``Certainly Churchill during World War II made it a very
personal affair and went in for great personal symbolism,'' he
said. ``He was much given to posing with a tommy gun and a bowler
hat, he went to bomb sites, walked the decks of warships. I've no
idea whether Blair has that analogy in mind, but I think he's just
doing what comes naturally.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Blair trying to muscle his friend Bill Clinton, ``British
prime ministers have been in the business of trying to influence
American presidents for a large part of this century,'' King said.
``Churchill regarded wooing and winning over Franklin Roosevelt as
a prime mission of his life, Attlee was always busy with Truman,
and Thatcher made it her business to work on both Reagan and
Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair's repeated calls for total victory (``no compromise, no
fudge, no half-baked deals''), his reliance on graphic accounts of
refugee miseries and his description of the war as a ``just'' one
based on moral principles have resonances in British political
history for Vernon Bogdanor, professor of government at Oxford
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gladstone talked of Bulgarian horrors and Turkish atrocities
in the late 1870s, and it's in the British tradition of the liberal
left to believe that one intervenes to define certain values,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Its proven military capability and willingness to use it has
always given Britain international influence, and Blair has
exploited the current NATO mission to emphasize his desire to
repair relations with the continent after the years of
Conservative-sponsored estrangement. In Aachen, Germany, this
month, he said he insisted that Britain resolve ``once and for all
its ambivalence towards Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to end the uncertainty, the lack of confidence, the
Europhobia,'' he continued.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's present popularity at home remains the highest of any
prime minister in British history, and the Conservative opposition
is fractured and ineffectual. Debate on Britain's war policy filled
little more than half the seats in the House of Commons last
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the risk of sounding naive,'' said King, ``one thing to
bear in mind is that Blair is a creature of calculation, but also a
creature of instinct. His sense of outrage at what the Serbs are
doing is both profound and completely genuine. I don't think he's
grandstanding, and he's a proven risk taker, led to his convictions
by his gut and his passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the failure of his view to prevail may not pose that high a
risk for him. If NATO settles for less than its declared
objectives, Blair will not be the one faulted. Prompted by winks
and hints from 10 Downing St., British public opinion and the
British press have already laid the charge of going for an
indecisive conclusion at the door of Clinton, and that is where it
will continue to reside.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Marr, a columnist for The Observer, wrote last week that
Blair's role as the aggressive young war leader at first struck him
as ``a crazy gamble.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added that even as NATO bombing mistakes mount and the
war's aims seem more remote, he found himself moving toward a
different conclusion. ``Every political instinct I have,'' Marr
wrote, ``tells me that Blair is going to emerge from this war with
Kosovo back in NATO hands and a position of European leadership no
British leader has enjoyed since 1945.''

Service for AMs of Sunday, May 23:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; INTERNATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``i'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-NATO (Brussels, Belgium) _ Even with the Clinton
administration's decision to push for 50,000 NATO troops on
Kosovo's border, the alliance will still face a decision within the
few weeks about whether its wants to begin preparations for a
larger, more powerful force that could fight its way into Kosovo.
By Eric Schmitt and Michael R. Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-TROOPS (Undated) _ Military and Balkans experts say they
believe that ground troops are essential to resolving the conflict.
By Neil MacFarquhar.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-REFUGEES (Kukes, Albania) _ More than 300,000 refugees
have already trudged through Kukes on their way to more secure
shelter farther from the border with Yugoslavia. But about 100,000
remain here, and among them are a large number from Prizren, who
have stubbornly refused to be uprooted again. By Anthony DePalma.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-HUMAN-RIGHTS (Belgrade, Yugoslavia) _ Much of the time in
Belgrade, it feels as if nothing is happening in Kosovo. People
complain endlessly about the NATO bombing, but there is a large
hole in the conversation. Barely anyone mentions Kosovo, let alone
the horrors that are occurring there. Natasa Kandic is one rare
exception. By Carlotta Gall.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN-WELFARE-REFORM (London) _ Through a two-pronged program
that aims both to put the unemployed back to work and to rein in
the country's $158.9 billion dollar-a-year welfare bill, Prime
Minister Tony Blair has pledged nothing less than an end to what he
calls the ``something-for-nothing welfare state.'' It sounds
reasonable, but it is a tall order. Aspects of the welfare reform
program have infuriated legislators on Labor's left wing and
interest groups representing the sick and disabled, who say that
some of the proposed cuts will take benefits away from some of the
neediest people. By Sarah Lyall.
</P>
<P>
   GLACIER-WAR (Siachen Glacier, in the Western Himalayas) _ For 15
blustery, shivering years, the Indian and Pakistani armies have
been fighting a war along the frigid peaks of the western Himalayas
_ in an area named for the Siachen Glacier and known as the
battleground on the roof of the world. By Barry Bearak.
</P>
<P>
   JORDAN-ABDULLAH (Washington) _ Three months after he ascended
the throne, 37-year-old King Abdullah of Jordan came to Washington
for serious work and a bit of fun. On the weighty side, he paid the
kinds of visits expected of a head of state: to the White House and
Capitol Hill. On the business side, he was guest of honor at a
lunch at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. On the fun side, Abdullah
went to the movies. He chose ``The Matrix,'' a cyber-age action
film. By Jane Perlez.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-NUKE (Washington) _ Inside Room H407, a tightly guarded
chamber of the Capitol, Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., listened
last October as Donald Rumsfeld, a former Secretary of Defense,
talked about China's missiles. Then Cox asked a crucial question:
How had the Chinese managed to modernize their nuclear weapons
program? By Jeff Gerth and Tim Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-POLITICS-ASSESS (Mexico City) _ The politicians gathered
at the conference of the governing Institutional Revolutionary
Party have voted to switch to a primary election system. But
Mexicans are not sure whether the party was truly embracing
democracy or simply freshening up democratic appearances, which
have been crucial throughout its 70-year domination of Mexican
politics. A news analysis. By Sam Dillon.
</P>
<P>
   FRANCE-LABOR (Paris) _ French workers appear to be particularly
skilled in timing their strikes to cause the most irritation. Last
summer, just as France prepared to welcome tens of thousands of
foreign soccer fans here for the World Cup finals, Air France
pilots went on strike. This year, with warm weather announcing the
start of the tourist season, it is now the staff of
government-owned museums and historic chateaus that are out on
strike. By Marlise Simons.
</P>
<P>
   OLIVETTI (Rome) _ In seizing control of stumbling Telecom
Italia, Olivetti, the former typewriter manufacturer that has
become a powerful European phone company, has embarked on a risky
business gamble that will reshuffle the European phone landscape.
By John Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NATIONAL &LR;  (Moving in ``a'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   LANDMARK-FARMSTEAD (Monroe County, Ill.) _ In the week of her
95th birthday, Emma Buck weeded her century-old rosebushes with a
120-year-old German sickle and fetched water in the well house. To
historians, Emma Buck's farm, which has never seen a tractor, is
``a remarkable survival of pioneer days in Illinois.'' The
farmstead that Miss Buck still tends, knees willing, with equal
parts frugality, conservatism and gumption, is a rare remnant of
America's rural agricultural heritage. By Patricia Leigh Brown.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS-BUSH-AGENDA (Houston) _ The Texas legislative session is
entering its final full week, and the two centerpieces of Gov.
George W. Bush's legislative agenda, a major tax cut and additional
spending on education, are moving to the center of the debate.
Exactly how much money will go to tax cuts and how much to
education will be hammered out in the session's final days. And
that result will ride the legacy that Bush carries into next year's
presidential race. By Rick Lyman.
</P>
<P>
   JOBS-BLACK-MEN (Undated) _ For nearly three decades, in good
times and in bad, young black men with little education and few
skills lost ground. Facing high unemployment, falling pay and
persistent discrimination, a depressingly large number never really
joined the work force or drifted out of it, getting by on handouts,
hustling or crime. But now the nation's job boom is drawing many of
these young men _ perhaps the most economically disadvantaged,
socially alienated group in America _ back into the economic
mainstream. By Sylvia Nasar with Kirsten B. Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   MORMON-MISSIONARIES (Provo, Utah) _ Since 1989, Mormon
missionaries have converted about 300,000 people annually. This
year, the church expects to have 60,000 missionaries at work in 163
nations, up from fewer than 30,000 men and women in 95 countries in
1986. No other North American church has built so large a
missionary force, nor one so focused on proselytism. By Gustav
Niebuhr.
</P>
<P>
   CAMPUS-ARRESTS (Washington) _ Drug arrests rose by 7 percent and
alcohol arrests by more than 3 percent on college campuses in 1997,
according to a survey being released on Monday by The Chronicle of
Higher Education, a national newspaper that covers education and
academic life.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WASHINGTON &LR;  (Moving in ``w'' news file.)
</P>
<P>
   UNINSURED (Washington) _ Health insurance companies are
proposing new federal programs and tax breaks to subsidize
insurance for millions of people without coverage. By Robert Pear.
</P>
<P>
   SEATBELT-CRACKDOWN (Washington) _ Police agencies are planning
another highly publicized enforcement blitz to encourage people to
wear seat belts during the Memorial Day weekend, as safety experts
have concluded that the twice-yearly crackdowns are causing lasting
increases in the numbers of people who buckle up. By Matthew L.
Wald.

AVALANCHE COACH HARTLEY COOL UNDER FIRE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ When Jerry Jones hired Barry Switzer, the Cowboys owner
said the new coach's lack of NFL experience was not a problem. Any
of 500 coaches could take that talented team to the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   The same thing could apply to the Colorado Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   When Marc Crawford, who led the team to the Stanley Cup in
1995-96, abruptly resigned after last season, Avalanche president
and general manager Pierre Lacroix turned to someone without any
NHL experience.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Hartley, a 38-year-old native of Hawkesbury, Ontario, was a
successful minor-level coach when he was hired, but it's a long way
from the Hershey Bears of the American Hockey League to the
Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   But like the Cowboys, the Avalanche was considered a cinch to
coach. Send Joe Sakic, Peter Forsberg, Adam Deadmarsh, Claude
Lemieux, Valeri Kamensky and Sandis Ozolinsh out for regular
shifts, and keep Patrick Roy in goal. Easy.
</P>
<P>
   It would appear so. The Avalanche is in the Western Conference
finals against the Stars, with Game 1 scheduled for 6:30 tonight at
Reunion Arena. Win four more games, and the team can take its
rookie coach to the Stanley Cup Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Only, it's not that easy.
</P>
<P>
   The coach gives the credit to his talented team.
</P>
<P>
   ``We trusted our players all year,'' he said. ``I have
absolutely no doubts about my players. They'll be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   But without a coach who learned when to push and when to pull
back, and who learned the right things to say and when to say them,
the Avalanche probably wouldn't be here today.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche got off to a rough start in the regular season,
winning just once in the first seven games.
</P>
<P>
   There was discontent in the locker room. The players grumbled
about Hartley's changing line combinations. They thought there was
a double standard for left winger Eric Lacroix, the son of the GM.
</P>
<P>
   It was a time when a young, rookie coach could have lost control
of his team.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he toned down his inflexible style. He held a team
meeting to let the players air their feelings about Lacroix, and
then engineered a trade.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, he didn't panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just his patience,'' Sakic said. ``Obviously, we had
the tough start, but he had a lot of patience with us, and
everybody believed in the system and we just went with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartley showed patience when Roy trashed his office in Anaheim,
Calif., after being pulled from a game and not getting credit for
the victory. Hartley kept his cool, and earned more respect.
</P>
<P>
   The Avalanche improved, and had the third-best record in the
Western Conference in the regular season. They beat the San Jose
Sharks in the first round of the playoffs, but then had to play the
two-time defending Stanley Cup champion Detroit Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   The teams were similar in talent, but the Red Wings appeared to
have a big edge behind the bench. Hartley was matched with Scotty
Bowman, the winningest coach in NHL history.
</P>
<P>
   Bowman not only knows how to win on the ice, he knows how to do
it away from the rink. He's a master at gamesmanship, and tries to
draw the other coach into verbal skirmishes to take pressure off
his players.
</P>
<P>
   It worked in the past against Crawford, but Hartley refused to
be drawn in. He remained calm, even when his team lost the first
two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first two games, he stayed calm and relaxed, and so
were all the guys,'' Sakic said. ``Our one goal was just to try and
win one game and get some confidence, and that's what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartley told his team to stop taking stupid penalties, and
instituted a neutral-zone trap. That, and some well-chosen words by
defenseman Aaron Miller, did the trick. The Avalanche won the next
four.
</P>
<P>
   The players make it look easy. The coach wouldn't have it any
other way.

ALL-GOLF CHANNEL NOT SO CRAZY AFTER ALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As the story goes, Alabama entrepreneur and golf fan Joe Gibbs
(not the football Joe Gibbs) was having dinner with Arnold Palmer
one night during the week of the PGA Championship at Shoal Creek in
Birmingham in 1990 when he threw out an idea.
</P>
<P>
   What, Gibbs wanted to know, did Arnie think of the idea of a
24-hour a day all-golf channel? The new channel would feature live
television coverage of golf tournaments from around the world.
There would be action from the European Tour, the Nike Tour, the
LPGA and the PGA _ plus instructional programs and player
interviews to round out the programming day.
</P>
<P>
   A crazy idea, yes?
</P>
<P>
   Well, actually, it wasn't. Not even five years after its
broadcast launch in January 1995, The Golf Channel boasts more than
25 million subscribers around the world, with 30 million projected
by year's end. The figure is especially impressive considering that
the channel is still a premium pay service in many cable TV
systems, so only those viewers who really want The Golf Channel get
it. Obviously, a lot do want it.
</P>
<P>
   That comes as no surprise to Denny Schreiner, who, as anchor for
the channel's PGA Tour broadcasts, is the most visible presence on
The Golf Channel. He was in Fort Worth to call the action at the
MasterCard Colonial at Colonial Country Club. The Golf Channel
aired the first two rounds, as it is doing for 10 PGA Tour events
this year. CBS, with which it shared production facilities and some
on-air talent this week, is handling this weekend's coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're actually ahead of where ESPN was \Rin terms of
subscribers\S in their fifth year,'' Schreiner said. ``You have to
keep in mind that we're still a very young entity. To me, the
potential for the channel is unlimited. It's worldwide and it's on
24 hours a day.''
</P>
<P>
   At one time, The Golf Channel might have seemed an absurdly
specialized concept for television. But, as the number of available
channels has proliferated, broadcast channel content has become
more and more niche-oriented. Anyone with a remote and a dish can
see that. So, The Golf Channel is the right concept for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Another aid to the channel's growth is its viewer demographics.
Golf fans tend to have high education levels and plenty of
disposable income, exactly the kinds of things advertisers are
looking for when they are considering time buys on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects for The Golf Channel are solid enough that Fox bought
a one-third interest in the venture a few years back. That
ownership stake gives Fox a toe into golf television through its
Fox Sports Net stations while providing The Golf Channel with the
capital to grow.
</P>
<P>
   Schreiner says ``the number one reason people buy and watch The
Golf Channel is to see live tournament action.'' For that reason,
The Golf Channel is airing 10 LPGA tournaments this year, plus 10
Nike Tour events and the full slate of European Tour events in
addition to the PGA coverage.
</P>
<P>
   That's also why, someday in the future, The Golf Channel could
show even more live tournament action, perhaps full-day coverage of
events on every major tour. For now, the channel is limited in what
it can air because of the high cost of broadcast rights fees
commanded by the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Schreiner, a sports broadcasting veteran who played collegiate
golf at the University of Akron, has been with The Golf Channel
since the start. Even though he travels 33 or 34 weeks each year in
his job, it's something he loves doing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a lot of time on the road, but there are only five or
six jobs like mine in the world,'' he says. ``In our business,
you're very rarely able to be on board when \Ra TV channel\S is
born. Here, I got to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Born of a crazy idea hatched over dinner a decade ago, The Golf
Channel is growing into an attractive viewing option for golf fans
everywhere.

<P>
   If anything seems obvious today, it is that globalization is a
new and powerful force that is erasing national borders and linking
the world in an unprecedented web of trade and investments. As one
tycoon put it: ``The world is a city.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was Baron Carl Meyer von Rothschild, in 1875, reacting
as stock markets tumbled all around the world, in unison, feeding
off one another.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest myth about globalization is that it is new.
By some measures, its peak occurred a century ago, making the 20th
century memorable in economic history mostly for its retreat from
globalization. In some respects, only now is the world economy
becoming roughly as interlinked as it was more than a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still not back to where we were 100 years ago,'' said
Charles Calomiris, a professor of finance and economics at the
Columbia University's Graduate School of Business.
</P>
<P>
   Labor is less mobile than it was in the last century. In those
days, passports were unnecessary and people could travel freely
from one country to the next, to visit or to work.
</P>
<P>
   That mobility led 60 million Europeans to move to the Americas
or Australia or elsewhere, and it helped fill up the United States.
In 1900, according to the census, 14 percent of the American
population was foreign born, compared with 8 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just labor. The 1860s and 1870s were a golden era for
free trade, and goods moved easily across borders. As late as 1879
an astonishing 95 percent of Germany's imports were still free of
duty. Low trade barriers led to an explosion of trade, so that
American exports soared to 7 percent of the gross national product
in the late 1900s; it is 8 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   Even capital seems to be less mobile now than in the 19th
century. A ``capital mobility index'' prepared by the International
Monetary Fund for a report in 1997 suggests that capital movements
as a proportion of economic output are still well below the levels
of the 1880s.
</P>
<P>
   How can this be? A century ago, England and France invested
hugely in developing countries _ places like the United States,
Australia and Canada. England invested a larger share of its wealth
abroad at that time than it does now.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign capital financed one-third of domestic investment in New
Zealand and Canada in the late 19th century, and one-quarter in
Sweden. In contrast, foreign capital accounted for only about 10
percent of domestic investment in emerging markets in the 1990s,
according to the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me as an economic historian, it was really the 19th century
that represented the birth of the global economy,'' said Alan
Taylor, an economist at Northwestern University. ``These days, it's
just getting back to where it was 100 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor suggested that 19th-century investors might well have had
a larger share of their stock portfolios invested abroad than
investors do today. He noted that Americans often have living rooms
full of goods from all over the world, but their portfolios still
tend to be focused in the United States. That discrepancy, he said,
may be an anachronism related to financial markets' being less
globalized than markets for goods (at least until recently).
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, globalization predates the 19th century.
Chinese demand for silver in the 16th through 18th centuries played
a role in financing the Spanish empire and the slave trade. China
absorbed perhaps half of the global production of silver, and that
bolstered prices and created wealth for mining magnates in the
Americas _ who traded their silver for slaves. After passing
through several hands, the silver was used to purchase Chinese
porcelain and silk.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is often said today that globalization is
irreversible, it proved very reversible early in this century.
After economic integration reached a peak in the late 19th century,
there was an astonishing retreat after World War I and especially
after the Great Depression. Since World War II, trade and
international investment rose again, and they have soared in the
last couple of decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first world war, we had a massive interruption and
reversal of the long-term trend,'' said Jagdish Bhagwati, an
international economist at Columbia University. ``One
interpretation is that now we're just climbing back on that
trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, today's globalization is new in some important ways, and
arguably it touches many more people than the earlier kind.
</P>
<P>
   Bhagwati noted that trade in the 19th century consisted mostly
of commodities. Now it is mainly manufactured goods with parts from
so many countries that it is difficult to describe the finished
products as made in any one nation.
</P>
<P>
   Capital flows are also different, says David Hale, chief global
economist of the Zurich Group, a financial services company. In the
19th century, capital movements represented the savings of a
relatively small group of prosperous families in England and France
who were investing for the long term. Today investments are far
more broadly based, he said, and much more likely to be leveraged
and short term, more flighty and speculative.
</P>
<P>
   One result is that capital rushes around the globe much more
quickly than ever before, and is more prone to sweep into countries
and then out. Technology has created an electronic herd but as yet
no electronic cowboys to control the herd.
</P>
<P>
   For a world without telephones or computers, the 19th century
had its economic advantages. Output shot up and down like a roller
coaster, but mostly up. Calomiris has recorded 90 major banking
crises over the last 20 years, and he notes that they often led to
runs on national currencies. In contrast, in the period from 1870
to 1913, he can find only five major banking crises, and just one
of those led to an exchange-rate crisis. In many ways, he argues,
19th-century globalization worked better than today's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to recapture the successes of the earlier
period,'' Calomiris said, but he thinks it is worth a try. It may
seem heretical to tinker with the 21st-century process by looking
over one's shoulder for models a hundred years past, but it is a
reminder that globalization may well be older than nationalization.

   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ President Fernando Henrique Cardoso
traveled to the United States early this month, and everywhere he
went the same people who four months before were worrying about an
Asian-style meltdown of Brazil's economy praised him for his astute
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, President Clinton led the chorus, expressing
relief at ``the substantial progress'' Brazil had made in
recovering from the fiscal crisis, which led to a 40 percent
devaluation of its currency in January.
</P>
<P>
   During his tour Cardoso also stopped in New York, where he was
peppered with questions about Brazil's implementation of a $41.5
billion economic rescue package backed by the International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Left unaddressed, however, was a more fundamental issue: To what
extent did the crisis reflect genuine deficiencies in the Brazilian
economy and to what degree was it a self-fulfilling prophecy,
brought on by panic and myopia in the global capital market itself?
</P>
<P>
   At this juncture, no one denies that Brazil's currency, the
real, had become overvalued against the dollar and needed to be
adjusted. Throughout his first term, Cardoso's main policy goal had
been to bring inflation, traditionally the country's biggest
bugaboo, under control; that made him eager to avoid any sharp and
sudden devaluation and the surge of higher prices that would follow
it.
</P>
<P>
   But Brazilians, from officials to the average citizen, are
increasingly convinced that a series of ``simplistic comparisons''
and ``undue generalizations,'' as Minister of Finance Pedro Malan
put it in a recent interview, made the situation last January worse
than it might have been and overlooked the country's underlying
strengths.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the world's eighth-largest economy has begun to right
itself, for example, all the talk about ``global contagion'' seems
particularly exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
   Except in the estimation of some traders abroad, Brazil was
never really comparable to Indonesia, where a family dynasty
enriched itself at the country's expense. Nor was it equivalent to
Russia, where the collapse of a communist state has allowed a mafia
to seize control of the economy, or even Mexico, where one corrupt
and ossified political party has wielded power for 70 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wall Street needs a geography lesson,'' Marcus Vinicius
Pratini de Moraes, a former Cabinet minister who is now president
of the Brazilian Association of Exporters, said recently. ``A bank
goes bust in Moscow and they sell their Brazilian shares? They
should go back to school.''
</P>
<P>
   Too late for Brazil and its 165 million people, who have had to
endure lost jobs and recession since January, stock markets around
the world seemed to recognize that error this month.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, speculative pressure on Argentina and its currency last
week generated some turbulence here and in other Latin American
countries. But Boris Yeltsin's dismissal of Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov in Russia caused barely a ripple.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, as the announcement was being made in Moscow, the Sao
Paulo stock market rose to an 18-month high, fueled largely by the
return of foreign money, and the Brazilian government was able to
announce the sixth cut in interest rates in the past two months.
</P>
<P>
   Other measures of Brazil's strengths are, if anything, more
revealing. In contrast to the traumas that have wracked Russia and
the Asian tigers recently, Latin America's largest country has in
just 15 years successfully made the transition, without violence or
social trauma, from military dictatorship to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Its democracy is often raucous, as is demonstrated by a current
congressional investigation into insider trading that took place at
the time of January's devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   But even though Cardoso has to work within a system of checks
and balances more restrictive than the systems facing his Asian,
Russian and Mexican counterparts, he has time and again delivered
on promises to restructure the Brazilian state and economy.
</P>
<P>
   After the agreement with the IMF was signed last November,
investors and officials abroad immediately began to view a
reduction of Brazil's often-generous social security benefits as a
test of Cardoso's resolve. Though the Brazilian Congress dithered
for two months, it eventually passed the legislation, which
requires a constitutional amendment.
</P>
<P>
   As political leaders here have noted, none of the countries that
have been hectoring Brazil on this matter _ not Germany, not
France, not Italy, and certainly not the United States _ have
themselves begun to come to grips with the issue at home.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the steps Brazil had taken to modernize its economy
even before the January crisis were substantial, more than what
many other countries have done in decades. When he took office in
1995, Cardoso inherited a highly protectionist economy. But he
quickly lowered tariffs, allowing trade and competition to surge,
and sold off one inefficient state-run monopoly after another:
ports, electricity, mining, telecommunications, railways, banks and
more.
</P>
<P>
   Cardoso maintained that course, showing unusual political
courage, even when a harsh recession set in after the eruption of
the Asian crisis in 1997, threatening both his re-election and
efforts to stabilize both prices and the real. Brazilian voters
were mature enough to resist opposition blandishments of short-term
relief in favor of what they saw as the long-term payoff that would
make their country an economic power: stability and growth.
</P>
<P>
   The late Carroll Quigley, the Georgetown University professor
whom Clinton has cited as his most influential teacher, used to
define capitalism as ``a system of accounting that ignores social
costs.'' Judging from Brazil's recent experience, the converse is
also true: market-driven philosophies are unwilling to grant credit
for social gains that cannot immediately be measured.
</P>
<P>
   To Riordan Roett, an expert on the Western Hemisphere at Johns
Hopkins University, Cardoso's most significant achievement may be
that during his first term ``more Brazilians were lifted from
poverty than in the past 50 years.''
</P>
<P>
   That feat, a result of the same inflation control and currency
stabilization program that came under speculative pressure in
January, has turned millions of poor Brazilians into consumers and
makes the country more attractive to foreign investors hunting for
new markets.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the crisis, a new study appeared here showing
that between 1994 and 1998, high school enrollments in Brazil
increased 37 percent, as parents realized that they no longer
needed to yank their children out of classes and send them to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are extraordinary numbers for so short a period,'' a
``gigantic leap,'' Claudio de Moura Castro, an economist who is the
co-author of the study, wrote in the news magazine Veja.

<P>
   LONDON _ What was a British prime minister doing dressed down in
an open-neck shirt and short sleeves and sitting cross-legged and
shoeless in a refugee tent in Albania? And why was this leader of a
spent imperial power passing as much time this month in places like
Aachen, Bonn, Brussels, Bucharest, Chicago, Mons, Sofia, Skopje,
Tirana and Washington as in London?
</P>
<P>
   Through a combination of passion, stamina and focus, Prime
Minister Tony Blair has turned his look of concern into NATO's most
familiar face, and his sermonizing speech into the alliance's most
insistent voice, articulating in emotive language a moral
justification for the conflict over Kosovo and a demand for an
uncompromising solution to it.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, he is projecting a belligerent British view
across the English Channel onto a continent that Britain has long
treated warily, and across the Atlantic to a continent that it is
used to addressing more modestly.
</P>
<P>
   So far Blair's aggressiveness enjoys considerable support in
Britain, but it has provoked some strong opinions abroad. Most
notably, his lobbying last week for an augmented ground force that
would be prepared to enter Kosovo before any peace settlement
brought annoyed retorts from two allied leaders.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton told the prime minister during a 90-minute
trans-Atlantic phone call that Britain was fostering a dangerous
appearance of disunity between London and Washington, and Gerhard
Schroeder, the German chancellor, said flatly that Germany was
against the introduction of ground forces and would veto it in
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder added a line that left no doubt who he thought was out
of line: he described the alliance's disagreement as ``this
specifically British debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Blair's combative campaign a case of the old British Lion
getting its lusty roar back? Or does it reflect a wholly new
British assertiveness, from a self-described young modernizer
interested now in remodeling Britain's global role in the
attention-getting way that he has been reshaping its politics at
home? Or is it a bit of both, the old noble beast turned out in
eye-catching trappings from New Labor stylists?
</P>
<P>
   To Kenneth Minogue, professor emeritus of government at the
London School of Economics, Blair's campaign represents ``a
remarkably high level of personal diplomacy for us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Diana syndrome,'' he continued, ``a policy made by
image, the image of miserable refugees, not one made in terms of
long years of development.'' He said the 46-year-old leader's
tactics had put the British into ``a position of having to put up
or shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And the problem is we can't put up, and we won't shut up,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   John Keegan, the military historian, said he thought Blair's
populist brand of politics was no way to fight a war. ``Master
politician that he is,'' he said, ``he has no experience of
conducting the diplomatic or military side of war. He is running
terrible risks. Polls show that he has a majority of public
support, but it is the support of tabloid readers. The
well-informed feel uninformed, are anxious and racked by doubt.
Those who cheer him on do so in the spirit of football
supporters.''
</P>
<P>
   But Anthony King, professor of government at the University of
Essex, sees Blair's current conduct as squarely in the British
tradition. ``Certainly Churchill during World War II made it a very
personal affair and went in for great personal symbolism,'' he
said. ``He was much given to posing with a tommy gun and a bowler
hat, he went to bomb sites, walked the decks of warships. I've no
idea whether Blair has that analogy in mind, but I think he's just
doing what comes naturally.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Blair trying to muscle his friend Bill Clinton, ``British
prime ministers have been in the business of trying to influence
American presidents for a large part of this century,'' King said.
``Churchill regarded wooing and winning over Franklin Roosevelt as
a prime mission of his life, Attlee was always busy with Truman,
and Thatcher made it her business to work on both Reagan and
Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair's repeated calls for total victory (``no compromise, no
fudge, no half-baked deals''), his reliance on graphic accounts of
refugee miseries and his description of the war as a ``just'' one
based on moral principles have resonances in British political
history for Vernon Bogdanor, professor of government at Oxford
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gladstone talked of Bulgarian horrors and Turkish atrocities
in the late 1870s, and it's in the British tradition of the liberal
left to believe that one intervenes to define certain values,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Its proven military capability and willingness to use it has
always given Britain international influence, and Blair has
exploited the current NATO mission to emphasize his desire to
repair relations with the continent after the years of
Conservative-sponsored estrangement. In Aachen, Germany, this
month, he said he insisted that Britain resolve ``once and for all
its ambivalence towards Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to end the uncertainty, the lack of confidence, the
Europhobia,'' he continued.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's present popularity at home remains the highest of any
prime minister in British history, and the Conservative opposition
is fractured and ineffectual. Debate on Britain's war policy filled
little more than half the seats in the House of Commons last
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the risk of sounding naive,'' said King, ``one thing to
bear in mind is that Blair is a creature of calculation, but also a
creature of instinct. His sense of outrage at what the Serbs are
doing is both profound and completely genuine. I don't think he's
grandstanding, and he's a proven risk taker, led to his convictions
by his gut and his passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the failure of his view to prevail may not pose that high a
risk for him. If NATO settles for less than its declared
objectives, Blair will not be the one faulted. Prompted by winks
and hints from 10 Downing St., British public opinion and the
British press have already laid the charge of going for an
indecisive conclusion at the door of Clinton, and that is where it
will continue to reside.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Marr, a columnist for The Observer, wrote last week that
Blair's role as the aggressive young war leader at first struck him
as ``a crazy gamble.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added that even as NATO bombing mistakes mount and the
war's aims seem more remote, he found himself moving toward a
different conclusion. ``Every political instinct I have,'' Marr
wrote, ``tells me that Blair is going to emerge from this war with
Kosovo back in NATO hands and a position of European leadership no
British leader has enjoyed since 1945.''

   LONDON _ What was a British prime minister doing dressed down in
an open-neck shirt and short sleeves and sitting cross-legged and
shoeless in a refugee tent in Albania? And why was this leader of a
spent imperial power passing as much time this month in places like
Aachen, Bonn, Brussels, Bucharest, Chicago, Mons, Sofia, Skopje,
Tirana and Washington as in London?
</P>
<P>
   Through a combination of passion, stamina and focus, Prime
Minister Tony Blair has turned his look of concern into NATO's most
familiar face, and his sermonizing speech into the alliance's most
insistent voice, articulating in emotive language a moral
justification for the conflict over Kosovo and a demand for an
uncompromising solution to it.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, he is projecting a belligerent British view
across the English Channel onto a continent that Britain has long
treated warily, and across the Atlantic to a continent that it is
used to addressing more modestly.
</P>
<P>
   So far Blair's aggressiveness enjoys considerable support in
Britain, but it has provoked some strong opinions abroad. Most
notably, his lobbying last week for an augmented ground force that
would be prepared to enter Kosovo before any peace settlement
brought annoyed retorts from two allied leaders.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton told the prime minister during a 90-minute
trans-Atlantic phone call that Britain was fostering a dangerous
appearance of disunity between London and Washington, and Gerhard
Schroeder, the German chancellor, said flatly that Germany was
against the introduction of ground forces and would veto it in
NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder added a line that left no doubt who he thought was out
of line: he described the alliance's disagreement as ``this
specifically British debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Is Blair's combative campaign a case of the old British Lion
getting its lusty roar back? Or does it reflect a wholly new
British assertiveness, from a self-described young modernizer
interested now in remodeling Britain's global role in the
attention-getting way that he has been reshaping its politics at
home? Or is it a bit of both, the old noble beast turned out in
eye-catching trappings from New Labor stylists?
</P>
<P>
   To Kenneth Minogue, professor emeritus of government at the
London School of Economics, Blair's campaign represents ``a
remarkably high level of personal diplomacy for us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Diana syndrome,'' he continued, ``a policy made by
image, the image of miserable refugees, not one made in terms of
long years of development.'' He said the 46-year-old leader's
tactics had put the British into ``a position of having to put up
or shut up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And the problem is we can't put up, and we won't shut up,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   John Keegan, the military historian, said he thought Blair's
populist brand of politics was no way to fight a war. ``Master
politician that he is,'' he said, ``he has no experience of
conducting the diplomatic or military side of war. He is running
terrible risks. Polls show that he has a majority of public
support, but it is the support of tabloid readers. The
well-informed feel uninformed, are anxious and racked by doubt.
Those who cheer him on do so in the spirit of football
supporters.''
</P>
<P>
   But Anthony King, professor of government at the University of
Essex, sees Blair's current conduct as squarely in the British
tradition. ``Certainly Churchill during World War II made it a very
personal affair and went in for great personal symbolism,'' he
said. ``He was much given to posing with a tommy gun and a bowler
hat, he went to bomb sites, walked the decks of warships. I've no
idea whether Blair has that analogy in mind, but I think he's just
doing what comes naturally.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Blair trying to muscle his friend Bill Clinton, ``British
prime ministers have been in the business of trying to influence
American presidents for a large part of this century,'' King said.
``Churchill regarded wooing and winning over Franklin Roosevelt as
a prime mission of his life, Attlee was always busy with Truman,
and Thatcher made it her business to work on both Reagan and
Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair's repeated calls for total victory (``no compromise, no
fudge, no half-baked deals''), his reliance on graphic accounts of
refugee miseries and his description of the war as a ``just'' one
based on moral principles have resonances in British political
history for Vernon Bogdanor, professor of government at Oxford
University.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gladstone talked of Bulgarian horrors and Turkish atrocities
in the late 1870s, and it's in the British tradition of the liberal
left to believe that one intervenes to define certain values,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Its proven military capability and willingness to use it has
always given Britain international influence, and Blair has
exploited the current NATO mission to emphasize his desire to
repair relations with the continent after the years of
Conservative-sponsored estrangement. In Aachen, Germany, this
month, he said he insisted that Britain resolve ``once and for all
its ambivalence towards Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to end the uncertainty, the lack of confidence, the
Europhobia,'' he continued.
</P>
<P>
   Blair's present popularity at home remains the highest of any
prime minister in British history, and the Conservative opposition
is fractured and ineffectual. Debate on Britain's war policy filled
little more than half the seats in the House of Commons last
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the risk of sounding naive,'' said King, ``one thing to
bear in mind is that Blair is a creature of calculation, but also a
creature of instinct. His sense of outrage at what the Serbs are
doing is both profound and completely genuine. I don't think he's
grandstanding, and he's a proven risk taker, led to his convictions
by his gut and his passion.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the failure of his view to prevail may not pose that high a
risk for him. If NATO settles for less than its declared
objectives, Blair will not be the one faulted. Prompted by winks
and hints from 10 Downing St., British public opinion and the
British press have already laid the charge of going for an
indecisive conclusion at the door of Clinton, and that is where it
will continue to reside.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Marr, a columnist for The Observer, wrote last week that
Blair's role as the aggressive young war leader at first struck him
as ``a crazy gamble.''
</P>
<P>
   But he added that even as NATO bombing mistakes mount and the
war's aims seem more remote, he found himself moving toward a
different conclusion. ``Every political instinct I have,'' Marr
wrote, ``tells me that Blair is going to emerge from this war with
Kosovo back in NATO hands and a position of European leadership no
British leader has enjoyed since 1945.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate made a bit of history last week, passing
gun-control legislation that had been left for dead a week before.
</P>
<P>
   The measures are modest, which may suggest that anti-gun-control
forces remain powerful despite concern over shooting incidents at
schools. But the fact that they passed at all suggests that a
center may be forming in a debate that has been dominated by two
extremes.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus seems to be behind measures to keep guns out of
the hands of children and criminals without seriously restricting
the ability of law-abiding adults to own firearms.
</P>
<P>
   It could all fall apart when gun-control legislation goes before
the House of Representatives, probably next month. The war could
then begin anew between those who want to go so far as to ban the
sale of inexpensive handguns and require all guns to be registered
with the police and those who believe Americans have the right to
own and carry guns more or less at will.
</P>
<P>
   But the vote for gun control in the Senate on Thursday, a month
after the massacre in Littleton, Colo., and the day of a
frightening shooting in a high school in Conyers, Ga., could mark a
turning point _ a first small step toward a middle ground between
the extremes on an extraordinarily divisive political topic.
</P>
<P>
   Parallels can be found on other issues. Consider, for instance,
health care and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   For two decades after World War II, one of the fiercest battles
in American politics was fought between those who wanted a national
health insurance system and those who thought any government role
in health care would amount to socialized medicine. The result was
deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   Then in 1965, Medicare and Medicaid were established providing
government insurance for the elderly, the disabled and the poor.
Those programs became almost instantly popular. Health insurance
has remained an issue in American politics. But the question is no
longer one of extremes _ whether the government should be in
control or excluded _ but rather what the extent of the government
involvement should be.
</P>
<P>
   On abortion, politicians were caught for years between those who
wanted to outlaw the practice and those who believed that women
should have an unrestricted right to terminate their pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, the Supreme Court found a point in between. The court
reaffirmed Roe vs. Wade, its 1973 decision establishing a
constitutional right to abortion, but the new ruling enabled states
to impose restrictions like requiring minors to notify their
parents before they had an abortion and imposing a waiting period
between a pregnant woman's first visit to a doctor for an abortion
and the procedure itself.
</P>
<P>
   Most Americans seem comfortable with this compromise, which
appears to have taken the abortion debate out of the hands of the
interest groups that had set its terms. It defused abortion as a
defining political issue so thoroughly that even Pat Robertson, the
founder of the Christian Coalition, is now saying it is pointless
to fight for a constitutional ban on abortion because it would
never pass.
</P>
<P>
   From the perspective of gun-control advocates, the measures
approved last week by the Senate, with Vice President Al Gore
casting the tie-breaking vote, are distinctly tame. They would
require background checks before firearms could be purchased at gun
shows or reclaimed at pawn shops; they would require childproof
safety locks or storage boxes to be sold with all handguns, and
they would restrict the access of children under 18 to
semiautomatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic sponsors of the legislation were careful to frame
the issue as one of child safety. They did not even try to restore
a waiting period for handgun purchases, a provision of the 1994
Brady law that has since expired. ``This debate has really been
about common sense, moderate efforts to limit the accessibility and
availability of weapons to children,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy
of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Even many Republicans who opposed the bill _ as all but six of
the 55 Republican senators did _ endorsed the principle of keeping
guns from children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will do everything in our power to reduce the availability
of guns to young people,'' said Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who
voted against the bill but has made it clear in his campaign for
the Republican presidential nomination that he is not averse to all
restrictions on gun ownership. McCain's leading rivals for the
nomination, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Elizabeth Dole, have
also indicated they can support some kinds of gun control.
</P>
<P>
   Not all politicians and scholars on gun control agree that the
Senate vote was a turning point. That will not come until the
politicians require guns to be licensed and gun owners to be
trained, said James Q. Wilson, a retired professor of public policy
at the University of California, Los Angeles, and a prominent
expert on guns and crime. ``I didn't see much in the Senate debate
that would encourage me to think that's in the offing,'' Wilson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Leading politicians here are still at odds. After the vote, Sen.
Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, insisted that
guns should not be blamed for shootings in schools. ``Guns don't
cause people to do these things,'' Lott said. ``When do we put the
responsibility on the individuals? That's who causes the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to that argument, Gore steered the issue back to
keeping children out of trouble. ``We used to have a problem with
aspirin poisoning of children in our country,'' he said, ``and we
appealed for better parenting and better parental controls of
children, but not until there were childproof caps on the aspirins
did the problem get significantly solved.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside Washington, the consensus behind keeping guns away from
children may be even stronger than it is here. Gov. Frank Keating
of Oklahoma, a Republican who keeps a .38-caliber pistol in his
night stand and who is an ardent opponent of restrictive gun
control, said in a telephone interview, ``Even in a sportsman state
like Oklahoma, people believe there are few if any circumstances
when children should have unrestricted access to weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., who now views Washington
politics from a distance as the director of the Institute of
Politics at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard,
said the Senate's vote on gun control confirmed a favorite theory
of his.
</P>
<P>
   ``Extremists on both sides eventually become exposed,'' Simpson
said. ``People on the edges of the left and right then tumble down
toward the middle. This is what happened on abortion, on
immigration, on the environment, on nuclear power. And now it's
happening on guns.''

 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In constitutional law, as in geology, things can
look perfectly stable on the surface _ until the tectonic plates
shift underneath.
</P>
<P>
   As the Supreme Court term heads into its final weeks, the
question is whether such a shift may be under way. In its decision
last week striking down California's reduced welfare benefits for
newcomers to the state, the court relied on a portion of the 14th
Amendment that forbids states to restrict the ``privileges or
immunities'' of American citizens.
</P>
<P>
   This is the long-neglected privileges-or-immunities clause, the
sudden resurrection of which, by a broad 7-2 majority, was
certainly one of the most surprising and possibly one of the most
consequential constitutional developments in years.
</P>
<P>
   The 14th Amendment, adopted in 1868 to ratify the outcome of the
Civil War, says in its first paragraph, ``No state shall make or
enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of
citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any
person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law;
nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection
of the laws.''
</P>
<P>
   There is historical evidence that the amendment's drafters
regarded the privileges-or-immunities clause as more important than
the much-invoked guarantees of due process and equal protection
that it precedes in the text.
</P>
<P>
   But the clause was sent into early eclipse by an 1873 Supreme
Court decision known as the Slaughter-House cases, which held that
the clause protected only the rights of national citizenship and
placed no new obligations on the states.
</P>
<P>
   So by turning back to this long-buried language, the court was
taking at least a tentative step on a new path of constitutional
analysis. While the ultimate destination is uncertain, it appeals
to both conservatives, who see the clause as a new source for
protection for property and economic rights, and weary liberals,
who see it as a means for protecting individual rights without
having to fight endless battles over the meaning of due process.
</P>
<P>
   Justices across the ideological spectrum signed their names to
this opinion, from John Paul Stevens, its author and arguably the
court's most liberal member, to Antonin Scalia, one of the most
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   While Justice Clarence Thomas dissented, disagreeing that
welfare was one of the historically protected privileges, he made
clear his enthusiasm for reconsidering the privileges-or-immunities
clause in an ``appropriate case.'' That left Chief Justice William
Rehnquist oddly isolated in his complaint that ``the court today
breathes new life into the previously dormant privileges or
immunities clause,'' an observation that the majority did not
rebut.
</P>
<P>
   The justices who came together in the California welfare case,
Saenz vs. Roe, did not necessarily do so for the same reasons, or
with the same expectations of where this new opening might lead.
The privileges-or-immunities clause has been invisible for so long
that there are few recognizable signposts, and there were no
concurring opinions by which individual members of the majority
might have elaborated on the analysis.
</P>
<P>
   But at the least, to carry the geological analogy a step
further, the opinion undoubtedly achieved a release of doctrinal
tension much as an earthquake relieves pressure that builds up
under the Earth's crust.
</P>
<P>
   The two-tiered welfare program challenged in this case was quite
clearly unconstitutional under the court's most directly relevant
precedent, a 1969 decision called Shapiro vs. Thompson that invoked
a constitutional ``right to travel'' to bar states from denying
welfare benefits during a newcomer's first year of residency.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there was probably no member of the current court completely
at ease with the analytic method that produced Shapiro vs.
Thompson. That decision represented a kind of high-water mark of
the Warren court's open-ended approach to constitutional analysis _
so much so that Chief Justice Earl Warren himself dissented from
Justice William Brennan's majority opinion, which candidly conceded
that the right to travel was not anchored to any particular place
in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no occasion to ascribe the source of this right to
travel interstate to a particular constitutional provision,''
Brennan wrote. It goes without saying that there are no
Warren-court-style liberals on the court today. Briefs from a group
of states and other interested parties in the current case urged
the justices simply to overrule the 1969 precedent.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in Stevens' practiced hands, the right to travel did
not disappear but morphed into a right of national citizenship that
each state is obliged to honor and that, more to the point, has a
solid foundation in the Constitution's text. For the court's
moderate justices, the privileges-or-immunities clause offers a
comfort zone that permits them to defend individual rights while
shedding the baggage of liberal methodology.
</P>
<P>
   For conservatives, particularly those with libertarian leanings
like Thomas, the appeal of the clause is even clearer. There is no
dispute that, as a matter of history, the privileges the
amendment's drafters sought to protect included the right to earn a
living, enter into contracts and acquire and maintain property free
of government interference _ all aspects of the natural law
philosophy that inspired the signers of the Declaration of
Independence.
</P>
<P>
   The privileges-or-immunities clause should be used to restore
``the fundamental connection between the Constitution and its
natural law foundations,'' Roger Pilon, director of constitutional
studies for the Cato Institute, a libertarian policy group here,
wrote in a law review article several months ago.
</P>
<P>
   One result would be, Pilon argues, to raise the level of
protection for economic rights, like unrestricted land use, which
receive only minimal scrutiny under current constitutional
analysis, to the level of protection given to individual rights
that under the current approach are deemed ``fundamental.''
</P>
<P>
   In any event, it is clear that the justices in a sense are
simply catching up with a lively discussion that has been going on
for some time among legal academics and constitutional historians.
A broad, although by no means universal, consensus has emerged that
the Slaughter-House decision of 1873 was based on a mistaken
understanding of the intent of the drafters.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the court has spoken, however tentatively, that
conversation will expand to a wider audience. Arguments based on
privileges or immunities will be developed in law review articles
and presented to lower court judges, who in turn will write
opinions that will provide more raw material for the court, if the
justices want to use it to move further down the new path.
</P>
<P>
   Just as the court does not act in isolation from the rest of the
legal system, cases on its docket do not exist in isolation from
one another. Between now and the end of next month, the justices
will announce decisions in three cases that challenge the power of
the federal government with respect to the states.
</P>
<P>
   It would be surprising if the court did not continue on its
recent course of shifting power away from Congress, a result the
states are actively seeking. But new power may come with a price
if, as California learned on Monday, the court at the same time is
placing new obligations on the states to safeguard the rights of
all their citizens.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In constitutional law, as in geology, things can
look perfectly stable on the surface _ until the tectonic plates
shift underneath.
</P>
<P>
   As the Supreme Court term heads into its final weeks, the
question is whether such a shift may be under way. In its decision
last week striking down California's reduced welfare benefits for
newcomers to the state, the court relied on a portion of the 14th
Amendment that forbids states to restrict the ``privileges or
immunities'' of American citizens.
</P>
<P>
   This is the long-neglected privileges-or-immunities clause, the
sudden resurrection of which, by a broad 7-2 majority, was
certainly one of the most surprising and possibly one of the most
consequential constitutional developments in years.
</P>
<P>
   The 14th Amendment, adopted in 1868 to ratify the outcome of the
Civil War, says in its first paragraph, ``No state shall make or
enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of
citizens of the United States; nor shall any state deprive any
person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law;
nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection
of the laws.''
</P>
<P>
   There is historical evidence that the amendment's drafters
regarded the privileges-or-immunities clause as more important than
the much-invoked guarantees of due process and equal protection
that it precedes in the text.
</P>
<P>
   But the clause was sent into early eclipse by an 1873 Supreme
Court decision known as the Slaughter-House cases, which held that
the clause protected only the rights of national citizenship and
placed no new obligations on the states.
</P>
<P>
   So by turning back to this long-buried language, the court was
taking at least a tentative step on a new path of constitutional
analysis. While the ultimate destination is uncertain, it appeals
to both conservatives, who see the clause as a new source for
protection for property and economic rights, and weary liberals,
who see it as a means for protecting individual rights without
having to fight endless battles over the meaning of due process.
</P>
<P>
   Justices across the ideological spectrum signed their names to
this opinion, from John Paul Stevens, its author and arguably the
court's most liberal member, to Antonin Scalia, one of the most
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   While Justice Clarence Thomas dissented, disagreeing that
welfare was one of the historically protected privileges, he made
clear his enthusiasm for reconsidering the privileges-or-immunities
clause in an ``appropriate case.'' That left Chief Justice William
Rehnquist oddly isolated in his complaint that ``the court today
breathes new life into the previously dormant privileges or
immunities clause,'' an observation that the majority did not
rebut.
</P>
<P>
   The justices who came together in the California welfare case,
Saenz vs. Roe, did not necessarily do so for the same reasons, or
with the same expectations of where this new opening might lead.
The privileges-or-immunities clause has been invisible for so long
that there are few recognizable signposts, and there were no
concurring opinions by which individual members of the majority
might have elaborated on the analysis.
</P>
<P>
   But at the least, to carry the geological analogy a step
further, the opinion undoubtedly achieved a release of doctrinal
tension much as an earthquake relieves pressure that builds up
under the Earth's crust.
</P>
<P>
   The two-tiered welfare program challenged in this case was quite
clearly unconstitutional under the court's most directly relevant
precedent, a 1969 decision called Shapiro vs. Thompson that invoked
a constitutional ``right to travel'' to bar states from denying
welfare benefits during a newcomer's first year of residency.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there was probably no member of the current court completely
at ease with the analytic method that produced Shapiro vs.
Thompson. That decision represented a kind of high-water mark of
the Warren court's open-ended approach to constitutional analysis _
so much so that Chief Justice Earl Warren himself dissented from
Justice William Brennan's majority opinion, which candidly conceded
that the right to travel was not anchored to any particular place
in the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no occasion to ascribe the source of this right to
travel interstate to a particular constitutional provision,''
Brennan wrote. It goes without saying that there are no
Warren-court-style liberals on the court today. Briefs from a group
of states and other interested parties in the current case urged
the justices simply to overrule the 1969 precedent.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in Stevens' practiced hands, the right to travel did
not disappear but morphed into a right of national citizenship that
each state is obliged to honor and that, more to the point, has a
solid foundation in the Constitution's text. For the court's
moderate justices, the privileges-or-immunities clause offers a
comfort zone that permits them to defend individual rights while
shedding the baggage of liberal methodology.
</P>
<P>
   For conservatives, particularly those with libertarian leanings
like Thomas, the appeal of the clause is even clearer. There is no
dispute that, as a matter of history, the privileges the
amendment's drafters sought to protect included the right to earn a
living, enter into contracts and acquire and maintain property free
of government interference _ all aspects of the natural law
philosophy that inspired the signers of the Declaration of
Independence.
</P>
<P>
   The privileges-or-immunities clause should be used to restore
``the fundamental connection between the Constitution and its
natural law foundations,'' Roger Pilon, director of constitutional
studies for the Cato Institute, a libertarian policy group here,
wrote in a law review article several months ago.
</P>
<P>
   One result would be, Pilon argues, to raise the level of

<P>
   JERUSALEM _ A month before he was resoundingly defeated last
Monday by Ehud Barak, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu explained
in an interview that attacks on his personality reflected one key
thing: the Israeli left's continuing need to blame somebody for the
assassination of Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed at the time to be a curiously outmoded interpretation.
What? It had nothing to do with his galvanizing personality as
prime minister, the way he alienated and divided even his Cabinet?
Was everyone really harkening back to 1995, when Netanyahu, the
opposition leader, was accused of legitimizing an atmosphere of
incitement against the prime minister, Rabin?
</P>
<P>
   On the night of Barak's victory last week, when tens of
thousands of young Israelis burned memorial candles for Rabin in
the square where he was assassinated, it was clear that Netanyahu _
``Bibi,'' as Israel called him _ had a point.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear that the Rabin assassination was an undigested
trauma for many Israelis, and that Barak's victory allowed a kind
of public catharsis of repressed grief over a national martyr whose
death at the hands of an extremist Jew changed the way many
Israelis felt about being Israeli.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bibi is still being held responsible and he probably has to be
retired for the country to get beyond Rabin's murder,'' Yaron
Ezrahi, a political scientist, said several days before Netanyahu's
defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Barak understood this, too. He is skillfully navigating his way
through the lingering images of Rabin, his own military and
political mentor. On election night, to declare his victory, he
joined the huge crowd that had converged on Rabin Square in Tel
Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   It was his night, but he celebrated amid huge banner pictures of
the slain prime minister. He stood beside Rabin's widow, Leah. He
looked into the sky and he talked directly to Rabin. He effectively
dedicated to him his electoral triumph, a landslide by Israeli
standards.
</P>
<P>
   The next morning, Barak's first act as prime minister-elect was
to visit the Rabin grave, as if to lay to rest once and for all the
great sadness before taking his first steps into the future.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as prime minister, Barak's challenge will be to diverge
from the model of his mentor, to emulate Rabin and, having learned
from his political mistakes, to move beyond him. He quickly made
clear that he intends to do so. He moved instantly to start
negotiating a broad coalition government, rather than rely on a
razor-thin majority as Rabin did.
</P>
<P>
   If Rabin's life was ended by the blood passions in Israeli
society, then successfully following in his footsteps means healing
Israel. It means being slightly less of a commander, and more of a
consensus builder.
</P>
<P>
   Like Rabin, Barak, 57, represents the old Israel. He is the very
model of the Zionist pioneer man. His mother lost nearly her whole
family in Treblinka. His father grew up an orphan after his family
was killed in a pogrom in Lithuania. He was born on a kibbutz
before Israel was born as a state. He spent his life defending the
dream of Israel, rising steadily through the elite military ranks
to become army chief of staff. He is Ashkenazi, a descendant of
Europeans; he plays classical piano; he is resolutely secular.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a typical representative of the species of new man the
fathers of the Zionist movement tried to create in Israel,'' Tom
Segev, an author, said last week.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate insider, Barak is coming to power at a moment when
kibbutzim are aging, or turning into shopping centers, and when the
supposed outsiders _ the Sephardim, who came from Middle Eastern
countries; the Russian immigrants, the ultra-Orthodox _ are
redefining what it means to be Israeli.
</P>
<P>
   Many Israelis who voted for Barak said they would have much
preferred to see a new breed of political leader arise, to see
citizen-candidates rather than generals. After all, the era of the
great wars is fading. Barak's classic acts of heroism _ leading a
unit that liberated a Sabena airplane from hijackers at Tel Aviv in
1972, for instance _ happened a generation ago.
</P>
<P>
   But maybe, they said last week, Israel is not ready for
political normalization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week I wrote about Barak that he is a somewhat outdated
portrait of Israel,'' Ofer Shelah, a columnist for the newspaper
Maariv, said last week. ``But we are lucky that is the case: We
need someone who can take us back a little, to the days when being
Israeli was an aspiration and not something accursed.''
</P>
<P>
   As a peacemaker, Barak is no radical. He does not talk, as did
Shimon Peres, his predecessor at the helm of Labor, about forging a
new Middle East in which Israelis and Palestinians live in a
harmonious political and economic integration. He aspires to
separation from the Palestinians; they have their land, Israel has
its land, and everyone goes about their business.
</P>
<P>
   It is the ideology of the pre-state kibbutzniks.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians, in the wake of their gloating enthusiasm about
Netanyahu's loss, started listening more carefully to Barak's
oratory and getting depressed about the hard line he took. But
Barak is very different from his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   He does not consider himself to be the reluctant inheritor of
international peace agreements he'd just as soon renege on, as
Netanyahu did. Instead, he is determined to build on the existing
agreements, establish professional diplomatic relationships with
the Arab world and move expeditiously toward final settlement with
Israel's neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   In a documentary film by Claude Lanzmann, Barak, who is
interviewed, says he sees Jewish history as a struggle between
fanaticism or extremism and pragmatism.
</P>
<P>
   The purists, he says, have ended up dead, like the zealots who
killed themselves at Masada. Barak is not a zealot _ just as his
mentor Yitzhak Rabin wasn't. Unlike Rabin, though, he comes into
power at a time when the right wing has withered.
</P>
<P>
   Rabin trod a path for him, and Netanyahu, a reluctant
peacemaker, nonetheless continued down the same road.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is a time when pragmatism, at least on the issue of
peace, has a better chance.

   ``Last week I wrote about Barak that he is a somewhat outdated
portrait of Israel,'' Ofer Shelah, a columnist for the newspaper
Maariv, said last week. ``But we are lucky that is the case: We
need someone who can take us back a little, to the days when being
Israeli was an aspiration and not something accursed.''
</P>
<P>
   As a peacemaker, Barak is no radical. He does not talk, as did
Shimon Peres, his predecessor at the helm of Labor, about forging a
new Middle East in which Israelis and Palestinians live in a
harmonious political and economic integration. He aspires to
separation from the Palestinians; they have their land, Israel has
its land, and everyone goes about their business.
</P>
<P>
   It is the ideology of the pre-state kibbutzniks.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians, in the wake of their gloating enthusiasm about
Netanyahu's loss, started listening more carefully to Barak's
oratory and getting depressed about the hard line he took. But
Barak is very different from his predecessor.
</P>
<P>
   He does not consider himself to be the reluctant inheritor of
international peace agreements he'd just as soon renege on, as
Netanyahu did. Instead, he is determined to build on the existing
agreements, establish professional diplomatic relationships with
the Arab world and move expeditiously toward final settlement with
Israel's neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   In a documentary film by Claude Lanzmann, Barak, who is
interviewed, says he sees Jewish history as a struggle between
fanaticism or extremism and pragmatism.
</P>
<P>
   The purists, he says, have ended up dead, like the zealots who
killed themselves at Masada. Barak is not a zealot _ just as his
mentor Yitzhak Rabin wasn't. Unlike Rabin, though, he comes into
power at a time when the right wing has withered.
</P>
<P>
   Rabin trod a path for him, and Netanyahu, a reluctant
peacemaker, nonetheless continued down the same road.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is a time when pragmatism, at least on the issue of
peace, has a better chance.

   WASHINGTON _ Reports from an investigation by a House committee
last week seemed to leave little doubt: Beijing's theft of secrets
from American nuclear weapons laboratories led to spectacular gains
by China in creating a modern thermonuclear arsenal. The
penetration went deeper and was more devastating than anyone had
imagined.
</P>
<P>
   Turf-conscious national security officials, called to account at
acrimonious congressional hearings, have blamed one another, and
one scientist has been fired.
</P>
<P>
   But officials have not been able to explain exactly why no one
has been arrested for crimes that enabled China to leap from 1950s
technology to an atomic force built on the most advanced research
of American laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   After all, for years the FBI has, seemingly routinely, ferreted
out spies, and the Justice Department has brought them to trial.
Just last week, in a much less important case, a former Australian
military intelligence analyst, Jean Philippe Wispelaere, was
arrested and charged with trying to sell more than 700 highly
classified American defense documents to an undercover FBI agent
who had posed as a spy.
</P>
<P>
   But veterans of espionage investigations, including former and
current intelligence and law enforcement officials, say that
slam-dunk cases like Wispelaere's are the exception. They offered a
variety of explanations for the government's inability to proceed
against the most significant figure to emerge in the nuclear
secrets case, Wen Ho Lee, the scientist fired from his job at the
Los Alamos National Laboratory. In a long explanation of his
activities, Lee has denied ever spying for Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Given the government's faint trails of leads, some
law-enforcement officials say they are not convinced of his guilt.
</P>
<P>
   The federal espionage law, which dates back to World War I, is
deceptively simple. It requires that prosecutors prove that a
defendant delivered, transmitted or attempted to communicate
classified national security information to a foreign power. A
stream of post-Cold War spy cases, from Aldrich Ames, the mole at
the CIA who spied for Russia, to Earl Edwin Pitts, who spied for
Russia at the FBI, have created the impression that spy cases are
no harder to crack than a sophisticated burglary ring.
</P>
<P>
   But counterintelligence officials say that espionage cases have
been among the most difficult because of the highly covert nature
of the crime, said John L. Martin, a former chief of the Justice
Department's Internal Security Section who is a lawyer at OSO
Group, a private investigative firm.
</P>
<P>
   In a bank robbery, he said, money is missing; in a homicide,
there is a body; in a kidnapping, someone disappears. But espionage
is a phantom act: Usually, nothing is missing, nothing is left
behind, and the victims may not know that they were a target.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for prosecutors, even well-schooled spies make mistakes.
In the case of Ames, after eight years as a mole for Moscow, his
profligate spending and maroon Jaguar in the CIA parking lot in
Langley, Va., aroused the suspicions of authorities. When agents
searched his house, they found in his bedroom closet a damning
spy's library of secret communications with the Russians.
</P>
<P>
   The weapons case involved secrets of W-88 technology, developed
by American scientists to miniaturize nuclear warheads. The theft
was not clearly understood in the United States until 1995, years
after the Chinese are believed to have acquired the information.
But by then the trail of the mole inside the weapons laboratory _
if there was one _ had grown cold, potential leads had dried up and
records from the mid-1980s, when the theft probably occurred, were
missing or incomplete.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Energy officials did not begin to suspect Lee
until 1995, and the FBI's investigation didn't begin until
mid-1996. Officials did not even know the information had been
pilfered until after W-88 technology was used by the Chinese in a
1992 test.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the investigation of Lee got under way, officials
have said, the case rested on evidence far too shaky to take to
court: his access to the highly classified W-88 information, his
travels to China and meetings with scientists there, and small but
potentially revealing incidents, like the time he was hugged by a
Chinese official in what seemed to be a congratulatory way.
</P>
<P>
   For their part, Justice Department officials say the evidence
was so dated and tenuous that in 1997 they twice refused the FBI's
request to seek authorization for a warrant that would have
permitted agents to use wiretaps and other monitoring devices
against Lee. Agents posing as Chinese operatives even tried to lure
him into spying, but had no success.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials complained that aides to Attorney General Janet
Reno were wrong to deny their requests and failed to aggressively
back them. As a result they did not search his computer until
earlier this year. That's when they found that he had transferred a
huge cache of highly classified nuclear design codes into an
unclassified computer.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unclear what happened to the data. If the government
had evidence that the information went to a foreign power, Lee
would probably be under arrest. It is uncertain whether he violated
laws against mishandling classified material.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the specifics of Lee case, American officials said they
have had difficulty in thwarting Chinese intelligence efforts.
Beijing's operations are far less structured than the spying
activities of traditional adversaries. The Chinese rely heavily on
getting information from Chinese professionals and students in the
United States who travel between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, most American counterintelligence agents are
trained in the spy-vs.-spy craft of the old Soviet KGB and East
bloc intelligence agencies. Instead of relying on case officers who
recruit people to steal information, Chinese intelligence
operations focus on scientist-to-scientist technical meetings in
China.

<P>
   HONG KONG _ China's newest city is crowded, expensive, polluted
and mired in its worst recession since World War II. Yet to listen
to Hong Kong's leaders, every person in mainland China with the
slightest claim to live here would scramble across the border if
the gates were opened.
</P>
<P>
   Since January, Hong Kong has been in a lather over the prospect
that it is about to be inundated by Chinese immigrants. The fears,
which began after a court here granted residency to mainland
Chinese who have at least one parent in Hong Kong, escalated into
near-hysteria when the government estimated that more than 1.6
million people would be eligible for residency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear that Hong Kong cannot bear the burden of these
1.67 million people,'' said Tung Chee-hwa, the territory's chief
executive, in a typically charged response. ``The consequences are
unimaginable.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week Tung asked Beijing, in effect, to overrule the court
by reinterpreting a part of Hong Kong's constitution that deals
with residency rights. Pro-democracy leaders accuse Tung of
flouting the rule of law, which has been the cornerstone of Hong
Kong's economic success and was supposed to survive the transition
from British to Chinese rule.
</P>
<P>
   That Hong Kong would put its legal system at risk to keep out an
influx from the mainland shows how vulnerable this enclave still
feels. Nearly two years after Hong Kong reverted to Chinese
sovereignty _ in a grand experiment known as ``one country, two
systems'' _ people here regard Hong Kong as a Xanadu that could be
spoiled by the masses from the vast Chinese hinterland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a typical immigrant mentality that says `I got in, now
close the door behind me,''' said Martin Lee, the leader of Hong
Kong's Democratic Party. ``This whole debate has brought out the
worst in people.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Hong Kong's woes, there is no disputing its allure. It
generates a gross domestic product of $25,200 per person, 33 times
that of the rest of China. It has more Rolls-Royces per square mile
than any city in the world. In a country of 1.2 billion people,
half of whom have not made their first phone call, Hong Kong has so
many cellular phones that movie theaters ask patrons not to talk on
them during love scenes.
</P>
<P>
   It may be one country, but measured by almost any economic
yardstick, it remains resolutely two systems.
</P>
<P>
   David Tang, founder of the Shanghai Tang boutiques in Hong Kong
and New York, speaks for many here when he asks: ``Do we want
millions of immigrants coming into a stable and bourgeois society?
Our starting point is different than 150 years ago, when this place
was a barren rock.''
</P>
<P>
   The debate has put Hong Kong's residents in an awkward spot.
Most are the children or grandchildren of Chinese refugees who came
in waves after the communist takeover in 1949 or during the
Cultural Revolution. While many still distrust the regime, the
motherland evokes genuine patriotism. Protesters mobbed the U.S.
Consulate here to denounce the errant bombing of the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, pelting it with tomatoes rather
than rocks, as protesters did in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to sharing their schools or neighborhoods with
mainland Chinese, Hong Kong's citizens wrinkle their noses. In a
survey of residents conducted shortly after the hand-over in July
1997, the words they most used to describe mainlanders were
``ignorant,'' ``impolite,'' ``dirty'' and ``greedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of this has to do with changing demographics. Many of the
mainland Chinese who poured into Hong Kong after 1949 were members
of the commercial elite. Those who came during the Cultural
Revolution tended to be scholars and intellectuals. The latest
batch, from neighboring Guangdong province, are mostly young, male
and uneducated.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a form of class discrimination,'' said a 40-year-old
woman from Guangdong province whose husband lives in Hong Kong.
``Many people in China have not had the chance to receive an
education.''
</P>
<P>
   The woman, who identified herself as Mrs. Siu, is trying to gain
residency for her 16-year-old daughter. Mrs. Siu's husband migrated
to Hong Kong in the 1970s, returning to China in 1981 to find a
wife. After the couple had their daughter, they discovered that
Hong Kong's immigration laws barred her from moving here. So Mrs.
Siu stayed with the daughter in China, while her husband moved
back.
</P>
<P>
   Attitudes toward mainland Chinese have also hardened in the wake
of the Asian economic crisis. With Hong Kong limping through its
second year of recession, blue-collar workers here worry that more
newcomers could crowd them out of the job market. Policy-makers
fear that an influx of unskilled people would make Hong Kong less
competitive than Taiwan and Singapore, both of which have
immigration policies that favor highly skilled applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say Hong Kong has exaggerated the projected number of
immigrants to scare the public and win support for reversing the
court ruling. ``It's probably the grossest misuse of numbers I've
ever seen by a government,'' said Michael DeGolyer, the director of
an academic project that conducts surveys on public attitudes about
Hong Kong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
   DeGolyer said some realities of Hong Kong life _ like its
stratospheric real estate prices _ would keep mainlanders away. In
fact, he said, some locals stay only because of its hospitals and
schools. ``If Hong Kong opened its border 24 hours a day,'' he
said, ``and if it built schools and medical facilities near the
border, at least 200,000 people would move out immediately.''

of the Asian economic crisis. With Hong Kong limping through its
second year of recession, blue-collar workers here worry that more
newcomers could crowd them out of the job market. Policy-makers
fear that an influx of unskilled people would make Hong Kong less
competitive than Taiwan and Singapore, both of which have
immigration policies that favor highly skilled applicants.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say Hong Kong has exaggerated the projected number of
immigrants to scare the public and win support for reversing the
court ruling. ``It's probably the grossest misuse of numbers I've
ever seen by a government,'' said Michael DeGolyer, the director of
an academic project that conducts surveys on public attitudes about
Hong Kong's return to China.
</P>
<P>
   DeGolyer said some realities of Hong Kong life _ like its
stratospheric real estate prices _ would keep mainlanders away. In
fact, he said, some locals stay only because of its hospitals and
schools. ``If Hong Kong opened its border 24 hours a day,'' he
said, ``and if it built schools and medical facilities near the
border, at least 200,000 people would move out immediately.''

   NEW YORK _ Help! Is there anyone at the television networks
interested in shows for viewers over 35? Is there a world beyond
20-something angst in which roommates in improbably fancy
apartments are obsessed with two quite boring issues, the boys
worried about commitment, the girls looking for Mr. Perfect? Do
viewers really crave more than one show with a happy gay roommate
(a trend since the success of ``Will and Grace,'' a series about a
woman and her gay roommate)?
</P>
<P>
   Are viewers eager to rush to the television this fall and turn
to new sitcoms involving a 34-year-old woman who falls for a
24-year-old room-service waiter or a rich woman who falls for her
super or a 14-year-old boy who is surrounded by his mom, aunt and
three sisters?
</P>
<P>
   Within the last few days in New York City the television
networks have shown snippets of prime-time shows to advertisers and
unveiled their fall schedules. For an outsider wandering in, the
message was unmistakable: Anyone over 35 should forget network
television (with some exceptions, including several new edgy shows
on Fox) and switch to old movies. Or beg HBO to rerun ``The
Sopranos,'' its hit drama about a Mafia don on Prozac, five nights
a week.
</P>
<P>
   What made the annual rite of spring so bleak was the degree of
cynicism and self-satisfaction among television executives and
writer-producers who proudly showed off their newest sitcoms and
seemed in denial over just how terrible they were.
</P>
<P>
   The faint scent of doom in the air _ that of the major networks
watching their audiences erode with the growth of the Internet and
cable _ failed to dampen the strange euphoria among executives at
the fancy parties following each screening.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more bizarre moments in the process of selling
prime-time programming was the odd juxtaposition of news and sitcom
stars. At the ABC event at the New Amsterdam Theater, the
Disney-owned home of ``The Lion King'' (Disney owns ABC), Barbara
Walters, Diane Sawyer and other news personalities were trotted out
and asked about the highlights of their careers. They could have
been the cast of the network's ``Two Guys, a Girl and a Pizza
Place.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly enjoying center stage, Donaldson intoned, ``I was
tear-gassed in the best places.'' He spoke about John Hinckley's
assassination attempt against President Reagan. ``I hoped he wasn't
shooting at me,'' he said with a shrug. The audience didn't know
whether to laugh or applaud in a Felliniesque moment that fused
journalism with show biz.
</P>
<P>
   No network executives or writer-directors quite matched those at
the WB Network, which prides itself as the only one set up to
appeal entirely to ``12- to 34-year-olds and that's it,'' according
to Jamie Kellner, the WB president. But because the network has
been successful with ``Seventh Heaven'' (which appeals to
families), ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and ``Dawson's Creek,''
there was a heavy dose of preening. One network executive described
WB as ``hip, exciting, cool and fresh,'' adding: ``We know who we
are. We think we know what you need.''
</P>
<P>
   Another WB network executive actually told the crowd of
advertisers and executives of local affiliates to watch WB to find
out how to deal with their children. ``Look at it this way,'' he
said, ``For those of you who can't talk to your kids, at least you
can watch TV'' to find out how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   A writer, Joss Whedon, who created ``Buffy the Vampire Slayer,''
which chronicles the adventures of student vampires, was in dead
earnest when he said, ``Buffy is a symbol of empowerment around the
country and beyond.'' How was left unsaid. But Whedon said he
realized ``that there was another story that needed telling.''
</P>
<P>
   That story is ``Angel,'' a new show about a vampire with a
conscience who comes to Los Angeles. `` `Angel' is about
redemption,'' said David Greenwald, the show's executive producer,
using the most popular word in Hollywood among writers and
producers to give meaning to a work that is quite often
meaningless.
</P>
<P>
   Also about redemption is yet another WB show, ``Popular,'' which
brings together a popular high school cheerleader (blonde, like all
her friends) and an unpopular girl (dark-haired, like all of her
friends) when their single parents become engaged. The show could
have been made by MGM in the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
   WB seems to be succeeding on this kind of fare. The other
networks are struggling. What was surprising about the sitcoms of
the other networks was not only the tepid quality of so many of
them, but their derivative nature. The success of ``Friends'' (see
above about 20-somethings obsessed with boring issues), has touched
off a tidal wave of other shows about more or less the same people.
</P>
<P>
   There's WB's ``D.C.,'' about five 22-year-olds in Washington
(``In this town no dream comes without a price''); there's ABC's
``Wasteland'' (six friends in the New York dating scene); there's
NBC's ``Cold Feet'' (three young couples) and there's WB's ``Jack &AMP;
Jill'' (``quirky and amusing look at six 20-somethings living in
New York'').
</P>
<P>
   Isn't there a world beyond fake 20-something angst?
</P>
<P>
   Help.

   This is the time of year when high school graduates scrawl happy
and tender sentiments in each other's yearbooks. But nothing so
innocent and uncomplicated could suffice at Columbine High School
in Littleton, Colo., scene of the United States' worst student
shooting rampage a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   With four Columbine seniors, including the two killers, among
those lost to the violence, the school's Class of '99 prepared for
a bittersweet graduation Saturday _ capping a week in which a new
school shooting in Georgia added further urgency to efforts to
control firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, some Columbine seniors had marked their difficult
passage in another way: A teacher, Thomas E. Johnson, had his
senior psychology students write essays on how they had been
affected by the April 20 massacre _ in which two alienated seniors,
Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, killed 12 students and a teacher
before committing suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who submitted essays had survived the rampage by
hiding in the library or an office. Others knew the killers as
classmates in one of Johnson's psychology classes. Others had been
close to one or another victim. Many wrote that their lives had
been profoundly changed. Excerpts follow.
</P>
<P>
   _ TOM KUNTZ
</P>
<P>
   From Aaron Welsh:
</P>
<P>
   Before I can go through what I learned from the tragedy at
Columbine High School on April 20, I would like to retrace the
incident. When it started, I was in the library doing homework for
history class. I was at a desk in the middle section when a teacher
came running into the library. She ran behind the main desk and
told us to get under our desks.
</P>
<P>
   While under the desk, I could hear gunshots and explosions in
the commons below the library. ... Very soon after, Eric and Dylan
entered the library. Dylan stopped by the main desk and shot behind
it. I don't know if he was shooting at the phone or the teacher. He
then joined Eric by the computer desks. They started systematically
shooting under desks and laughing about what they had done.
</P>
<P>
   They walked across the section I was in and into the reference
section, where they shot more people under the desks. Eric moved
back to the computer desks to reload his shotgun while Dylan came
up the middle section and walked by the desk I was under. He never
saw me. ...
</P>
<P>
   After the incident, I had time to reflect on what happened. I
realized that I could have been one of the students who didn't make
it out alive. When I realized this, I started to wonder about how I
would be remembered; how friends and family would see my life.
Would they say I lived my life to the fullest ...?
</P>
<P>
   From Janelle Behan:
</P>
<P>
   At first when this happened, people kept telling me that
``Everything happens for a reason.'' That line made me so angry.
How could there ever be a reason for something like this to happen,
and what good could ever come from it? Well, as each day goes by
now, I am seeing more and more good that is coming from it. ...
</P>
<P>
   Some of the good began even before everything was over, while I
still was in the choir office with 60 other students. There were
people I hardly knew who were comforting me, hugging me and telling
me that everything was going to be OK. There was a group of about
six boys who literally saved all of our lives. If it hadn't been
for all of them, none of us would have known what to do. It was
kind of funny, because many of these boys are thought of as goofy
kids in everyday life. But they had taken the panels out of the
ceiling to lift girls through who couldn't breathe, and they kept
all of us quiet so that we couldn't be heard outside. I learned
that many people at school who I thought I really didn't like, I
love them all! ...
</P>
<P>
   From Janna Buchl:
</P>
<P>
   My life style will forever be changed. I am jumpy at certain
things. For instance, I went to Elitch's ((an amusement park)) a
few days ago, and a balloon popped while I was standing in line to
get on the Mind Eraser. I immediately ducked into a fetal position,
covering the back of my neck with my hands. Everyone started to
laugh at me, until I told them that I was a Columbine student. I
felt so stupid.
</P>
<P>
   Other things, even very small things, alarm me more than they
used to. I walk very cautiously down the sidewalks now for no
apparent reason. And I shudder at the sight of guns my father keeps
locked up (for hunting purposes only). ...
</P>
<P>
   The biggest changes come from my family. My birthday was on
April 25, and the day after, I was planning on moving out of my
house and moving in with my friend. I had everything planned out: I
would get a tattoo and my parents would kick me out. I started to
pack my things on the 19th. When the tragedy happened, I started to
unpack my things. I had decided to stay with the ones who cared
about me the most _ my parents and my sister. They have been with
me every single step of the way _ through the tears and the anger,
and of not knowing if all the people I knew were OK. Now, after
everything that has happened, I do not want to leave, even for
college. I am afraid of what might happen out in the world by
myself.
</P>
<P>
   From Denise Barrett:
</P>
<P>
   A bunch of friends and I got tattoos recently. All of the girls
except for one got a Columbine flower. Many of them had the words
``CHS 4/20/99'' put on the tattoo. I didn't want that. ... To put
those words on something that symbolized Columbine was to say I
will only remember this day, and I didn't want to be bound only to
something that horrid. I want to see the Columbine flower and
remember all the happy times in high school.
</P>
<P>
   From Patrice Doyle:
</P>
<P>
   I do not believe I will ever understand what those horrible boys
were thinking. That is what bugs me the most, what were they
thinking? This tragedy, though, has taught me many things.
</P>
<P>
   The way I live my life has come into my head many times. Am I
doing the right thing always? Am I making people feel bad by the
way I am treating them? I know joking is a part of life, but I will
never make fun of someone unjokingly again. I hope many kids see,
instead of just hearing about it, how much teasing can hurt a
person.
</P>
<P>
   From Kendra Curry:
</P>
<P>
   I don't care what people think about Eric and Dylan. I forgave
them a long time ago! It's not my place to judge them, only God's
place. ... God does everything for a reason and I know why He did
this. God did this because He wanted us all to wake up and realize
not to judge or hurt other people.

house and moving in with my friend. I had everything planned out: I
would get a tattoo and my parents would kick me out. I started to
pack my things on the 19th. When the tragedy happened, I started to
unpack my things. I had decided to stay with the ones who cared
about me the most _ my parents and my sister. They have been with
me every single step of the way _ through the tears and the anger,
and of not knowing if all the people I knew were OK. Now, after
everything that has happened, I do not want to leave, even for
college. I am afraid of what might happen out in the world by
myself.
</P>
<P>
   From Denise Barrett:
</P>
<P>
   A bunch of friends and I got tattoos recently. All of the girls
except for one got a Columbine flower. Many of them had the words
``CHS 4/20/99'' put on the tattoo. I didn't want that. ... To put
those words on something that symbolized Columbine was to say I
will only remember this day, and I didn't want to be bound only to
something that horrid. I want to see the Columbine flower and
remember all the happy times in high school.
</P>
<P>
   From Patrice Doyle:
</P>
<P>
   I do not believe I will ever understand what those horrible boys
were thinking. That is what bugs me the most, what were they
thinking? This tragedy, though, has taught me many things.
</P>
<P>
   The way I live my life has come into my head many times. Am I
doing the right thing always? Am I making people feel bad by the
way I am treating them? I know joking is a part of life, but I will
never make fun of someone unjokingly again. I hope many kids see,
instead of just hearing about it, how much teasing can hurt a
person.
</P>
<P>
   From Kendra Curry:
</P>
<P>
   I don't care what people think about Eric and Dylan. I forgave
them a long time ago! It's not my place to judge them, only God's
place. ... God does everything for a reason and I know why He did
this. God did this because He wanted us all to wake up and realize
not to judge or hurt other people.
</P>

   From Pam Glazner:
</P>
<P>
   In my experience coping with this event thus far, I have
reflected upon my own way of life and decided a few changes are
necessary. I, as a rule, am tense and I tend to forget to enjoy
simple pleasures because I am so busy. I also tend to stress out
and get upset over relatively minute details. Lauren Townsend, my
friend who died in the library at CHS, was a very studious and
hard-working girl, yet she also found time to fit in pleasure,
without stressing herself too much. I hope to learn from her
example, now knowing all too well how quickly life can escape us.
</P>
<P>
   From Rachel Goodwin:
</P>
<P>
   Why Lauren? What did she ever do in her life to deserve such a
fate? Why did this have to happen? Why not me? I remember feeling
pain and sorrow, but not as much as the guilt.
</P>
<P>
   I should have been in the library with them. I should have gone
looking for her to go out to lunch with me. I should have ... What
if ... All the while blaming myself for her death.
</P>
<P>
   Then the funeral. I think that this event was the hardest thing
that I have ever had to do; to bury a best friend, a teammate, a
future roommate, a child cut down before she could even experience
life. Seeing her parents there broke my heart completely in two.
They were so strong, so caring about us and how we were doing. Why
couldn't that strength find me?
</P>
<P>
   I remember our last goodbye to her; our volleyball team had worn
our ribbons to her funeral. Lauren's favorite _ our neon
green-and-blue polka dot ribbons that never gave us the luck we
wished for, but nonetheless were our favorites. During the service,
we all took them out of our hair, went up to her coffin and placed
them on the flowers that adorned the coffin. She was buried with
them. ...
</P>
<P>
   I will forever miss the good times we shared; the fun we had
going to volleyball games in the bus, singing until our faces were
blue, going out to eat at a restaurant and getting in a food fight,
the private and personal inside jokes that we shared, that we would
laugh hysterically at while others looked on, probably thinking,
``What weirdos.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   These memories of Lauren will never leave me. ... I look forward
to the day when I can see her smiling face again, reminisce on old
times, share our inside jokes again, laugh until tears run down our
faces and our cheeks and stomachs hurt, and finally tell her how
much I really love her, now and forever.

<P>
   If anything seems obvious today, it is that globalization is a
new and powerful force that is erasing national borders and linking
the world in an unprecedented web of trade and investments. As one
tycoon put it: ``The world is a city.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was Baron Carl Meyer von Rothschild, in 1875, reacting
as stock markets tumbled all around the world, in unison, feeding
off one another.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest myth about globalization is that it is new.
By some measures, its peak occurred a century ago, making the 20th
century memorable in economic history mostly for its retreat from
globalization. In some respects, only now is the world economy
becoming roughly as interlinked as it was more than a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still not back to where we were 100 years ago,'' said
Charles Calomiris, a professor of finance and economics at the
Columbia University's Graduate School of Business.
</P>
<P>
   Labor is less mobile than it was in the last century. In those
days, passports were unnecessary and people could travel freely
from one country to the next, to visit or to work.
</P>
<P>
   That mobility led 60 million Europeans to move to the Americas
or Australia or elsewhere, and it helped fill up the United States.
In 1900, according to the census, 14 percent of the American
population was foreign born, compared with 8 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just labor. The 1860s and 1870s were a golden era for
free trade, and goods moved easily across borders. As late as 1879
an astonishing 95 percent of Germany's imports were still free of
duty. Low trade barriers led to an explosion of trade, so that
American exports soared to 7 percent of the gross national product
in the late 1900s; it is 8 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   Even capital seems to be less mobile now than in the 19th
century. A ``capital mobility index'' prepared by the International
Monetary Fund for a report in 1997 suggests that capital movements
as a proportion of economic output are still well below the levels
of the 1880s.
</P>
<P>
   How can this be? A century ago, England and France invested
hugely in developing countries _ places like the United States,
Australia and Canada. England invested a larger share of its wealth
abroad at that time than it does now.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign capital financed one-third of domestic investment in New
Zealand and Canada in the late 19th century, and one-quarter in
Sweden. In contrast, foreign capital accounted for only about 10
percent of domestic investment in emerging markets in the 1990s,
according to the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me as an economic historian, it was really the 19th century
that represented the birth of the global economy,'' said Alan
Taylor, an economist at Northwestern University. ``These days, it's
just getting back to where it was 100 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor suggested that 19th-century investors might well have had
a larger share of their stock portfolios invested abroad than
investors do today. He noted that Americans often have living rooms
full of goods from all over the world, but their portfolios still
tend to be focused in the United States. That discrepancy, he said,
may be an anachronism related to financial markets' being less
globalized than markets for goods (at least until recently).
</P>
<P>
   In some respects, globalization predates the 19th century.
Chinese demand for silver in the 16th through 18th centuries played
a role in financing the Spanish empire and the slave trade. China
absorbed perhaps half of the global production of silver, and that
bolstered prices and created wealth for mining magnates in the
Americas _ who traded their silver for slaves. After passing
through several hands, the silver was used to purchase Chinese
porcelain and silk.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is often said today that globalization is
irreversible, it proved very reversible early in this century.
After economic integration reached a peak in the late 19th century,
there was an astonishing retreat after World War I and especially
after the Great Depression. Since World War II, trade and
international investment rose again, and they have soared in the
last couple of decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first world war, we had a massive interruption and
reversal of the long-term trend,'' said Jagdish Bhagwati, an
international economist at Columbia University. ``One
interpretation is that now we're just climbing back on that
trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, today's globalization is new in some important ways, and
arguably it touches many more people than the earlier kind.
</P>
<P>
   Bhagwati noted that trade in the 19th century consisted mostly
of commodities. Now it is mainly manufactured goods with parts from
so many countries that it is difficult to describe the finished
products as made in any one nation.
</P>
<P>
   Capital flows are also different, says David Hale, chief global
economist of the Zurich Group, a financial services company. In the
19th century, capital movements represented the savings of a
relatively small group of prosperous families in England and France
who were investing for the long term. Today investments are far
more broadly based, he said, and much more likely to be leveraged
and short term, more flighty and speculative.
</P>
<P>
   One result is that capital rushes around the globe much more
quickly than ever before, and is more prone to sweep into countries
and then out. Technology has created an electronic herd but as yet
no electronic cowboys to control the herd.
</P>
<P>
   For a world without telephones or computers, the 19th century
had its economic advantages. Output shot up and down like a roller
coaster, but mostly up. Calomiris has recorded 90 major banking
crises over the last 20 years, and he notes that they often led to
runs on national currencies. In contrast, in the period from 1870
to 1913, he can find only five major banking crises, and just one
of those led to an exchange-rate crisis. In many ways, he argues,
19th-century globalization worked better than today's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hard to recapture the successes of the earlier
period,'' Calomiris said, but he thinks it is worth a try. It may
seem heretical to tinker with the 21st-century process by looking
over one's shoulder for models a hundred years past, but it is a
reminder that globalization may well be older than nationalization.

   TOAD-TRANSMITTER (Angeles National Forest, Calif.) _ Trying to
get a better idea of the habits and habitats of a rare species of
toad, U.S. Forest Service biologists have strapped tiny radio
transmitters on belts to seven toads. The transmitters, the size of
a dime and costing about $30 each, let biologists track their
movements. So far, the toads seem to be moving farther up
Littlerock Creek canyon _ good news for off-roaders who have been
closed out of their usual driving areas downstream.

TOAD TRANSMITTERS TO AID PARK IN SCHEDULING

<P>
   ANGELES NATIONAL FOREST, Calif. _ After months of debate about
the closure of 3,000 acres of the Angeles National Forest because
of an endangered toad, U.S. Forest Service biologists have taken a
new step to better understand the creature's habits and habitat.
</P>
<P>
   Six southwestern arroyo toads were captured May 14 and fitted
with dime-size radio transmitters weighing about two grams each,
and 10 more toads will be fitted within the next several days.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best way we know of to study them,'' said Bill
Brown, a U.S. Forest Service biologist. ``The more we know about
the critters, the greater opportunity we have to make informed
opinions.''
</P>
<P>
   The transmitters will let biologists track the Little Rock Creek
Canyon toad population and gather data about the toads' habits,
including how far they roam from streams, which are breeding
grounds in spring and summer, and what time of the year they move
into the adjoining mountain terraces.
</P>
<P>
   Such information will let forest officials decide whether to
open parts of the closed area, which runs from Littlerock Reservoir
back into the San Gabriel Mountains almost to Angeles Crest
Highway. The closure has particularly angered off-road vehicle
enthusiasts, because it forced them out of a popular off-roading
area near the reservoir and closed two vehicle trails.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we figure out their habits, we can then do seasonal
closures in the areas they inhabit,'' Brown said. ``If they move up
to the terraces in the winter then we know we can open the rest of
the area during that period.''
</P>
<P>
   The transmitter packs, which are strapped onto the two- to
three-inch long toads with a tiny belt, cost about $30 each.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists track them using hand-held receivers, hooked to
antennas like a rooftop television aerial. The receiver beeps when
it detects a transmitter: the closer the transmitter, the quicker
the beeps.
</P>
<P>
   The biologists return periodically to check where the toads are
living, carrying the receivers along Little Rock Creek but
otherwise leaving the toads alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to hike through all the inhabited areas, but just
tracking them,'' Brown said. ``The less we handle them the better.
Our job is to aid and protect the endangered species but we also
want the OHVers (off-highway vehicle users) to be able to use the
area.''
</P>
<P>
   The arroyo toad, Bufo microscaphus californicus, was declared
endangered in 1994. Experts say the toad is near extinction because
Southern California has dammed or paved nearly all the streams
where it lived, except for far upstream stretches like Little Rock
Creek in the San Gabriel Mountains or Piru Creek in Ventura County.
</P>
<P>
   Before getting the transmitters onto the toads, biologists tried
to locate the creatures by going out at night with a flashlight and
listening for toad calls.
</P>
<P>
   If a biologist heard a toad, he'd shine a flashlight in the
direction of the call. That makes the toad's eyes shine.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists will track the transmitter-wearing toads for at least
three years. They have to catch them every six weeks to replace the
batteries.
</P>
<P>
   Although the transmitters have been used in field studies
before, Brown says it is hard to know how they will affect the
toads wearing them. The tiny device was designed to allow the
creature as much freedom as possible, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing a thin antenna longer than the toad who wears it, the
device itself is covered in a pliable tubing that protects it from
water and from the sand into which the toad burrows.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things were designed to hold up in the toad's natural
environment,'' said district ranger Mike Wickman. ``They're a great
help in our studies.''

   A New Furor Over an Old Whaling Tradition
</P>
<P>
   The gray whales that migrate from Mexico to the Bering Sea were
driven to the edge of extinction by commercial whaling by the
1920s. That is when the Makah Indians, who live at the very
northwestern tip of the lower 48 states and had relied on the
whales for a large part of their diet for centuries, stopped
hunting the grays.
</P>
<P>
   But the whale population recovered and now numbers at least
25,000, so the Makah decided to revive their tribal tradition of
whaling, around which many ceremonies, legends and songs were
built. Last week the Pacific Ocean near Father and Son Rocks, just
off Olympic National Park in Washington, turned red when tribal
hunters harpooned and then shot a 30-ton female whale with a
.50-caliber assault rifle.
</P>
<P>
   The Makah are likely to conduct more hunts: Under an
international pact, they can kill up to 20 whales over the next
four years for ``subsistence or ceremonial purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Some environmental groups, torn between a desire to protect the
whales and respect for the ancient Indian traditions invoked by the
Makah, took no position on the hunt, while others said the whales'
real enemy was not the Makah but commercial whalers in other parts
of the world.
</P>
<P>
   But other groups expressed outrage. ``We're obviously very upset
that the Makah went ahead with killing an innocent sentient
creature in such a bloody and untraditional way,'' the Sea Defense
Alliance said.
</P>
<P>
   Makah leaders were jubilant about what they called a cultural
revival but also angered by the criticism. ``Why don't people
question other cultures?'' asked the tribal chairman, Ben Johnson
Jr., who said the rifle was used only to hasten the whale's death.
``They're going over us with a fine-tooth comb.''

   Yeltsin Gambles and Comes Out Ahead
</P>
<P>
   President Boris Yeltsin won impressive tactical victories on two
fronts _ not bad for an unpopular leader who just a few months ago
was being written off as an ailing and erratic figurehead. First
came the fizzling of a long-threatened impeachment drive headed by
his Communist-led opposition, followed a few days later by the easy
approval of his new prime minister, Sergei Stepashin, in the
Communist-dominated Duma.
</P>
<P>
   Having regained the initiative, Yeltsin now has to get back to
governing. His first move was to pointedly remind Stepashin that
all Cabinet appointments must be cleared with the Kremlin. His
second was to head south to the Black Sea for a two-week vacation.

   Guilty Plea by Fund-Raiser
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department got a lift in its campaign finance
inquiry when a Democratic fund-raiser and Arkansas friend of
President Clinton pleaded guilty in federal court to two political
fund-raising charges. Yah Lin Trie, a Taiwan-born naturalized
American citizen known as Charlie, also agreed to cooperate with
the department in its investigation into the financing of Clinton's
1996 campaign.

</P>
<P>
   For the seventh consecutive year, crime in the United States

Violent crimes and property crimes each fell 7 percent, declines
criminologists attributed to several factors, including an
expanding economy, a larger prison population and a lower demand
for crack cocaine.

   Gandhi Roils Indian Politics
</P>
<P>
   The Congress Party, once India's dominant political force,
appeared to be poised to make electoral gains in general elections
this September, but the abrupt resignation of the party's
president, Sonia Gandhi, has thrown all political calculations into
disarray.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Gandhi, who married into an Indian political dynasty, quit
after three rebellious leaders in the party openly opposed her
candidacy for prime minister because she was born in Italy. The
leaders were expelled from the party later in the week.

   New Deal on Korea Sanctions
</P>
<P>
   Since the Korean War ended in stalemate in 1953, Washington's
approach to North Korea has been pretty straightforward: Isolate
the place, and hope it will collapse in Stalinist rubble. But
somehow it has held together, starving but building missiles and
aspiring to build nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes former Defense Secretary William Perry, who arrives in
Pyongyang this week with a new deal as the first-ever presidential
envoy: Give up your long-range missile program, stop exporting arms
and forget about the nukes. In return, Washington would start
lifting its economic embargo.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal would require the world's most isolated country to
open up, a move it has always resisted.

more than ``The Lost World: Jurassic Park'' took in two years ago.
Armed with galactic hype, ``The Phantom Menace'' didn't need any

   Asked if Mrs. Dole would hold steady in polls as the No. 2

   Asked whether he or Mrs. Dole was more popular on the trail,
Dole passed up an opportunity to make a pitch for the candidate.
``We haven't had one of those tests yet,'' he said. ``There hasn't
been a place where they introduced me and introduced her and had
the applause meter on.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked to rate the chances that Mrs. Dole would capture the
nomination, he said: ``I don't know. It's too early. Ask me that in

   Dole said he missed the thrill of the campaign that his wife is
now enjoying. ``It's like the old mailman who goes for a walk every
day when he retires,'' he said. ``Once it's in your blood, you want
to go out there.''
</P>

   Dole was only half joking when he said he regretted turning over
his political action committee in 1996 to one of his wife's future
rivals, former Vice President Dan Quayle. ``I probably should have
put it in a trust,'' he said. Dole also mocked President Clinton
for giving an interview recently about Vice President Al Gore's
political weaknesses. ``Letterman and Leno are going to have a

population, the cluster of low-rise buildings in the shadow of the
Wasatch Mountains here resembles a small state college. But its
hallways are decorated with religious art, the campus bookstore
does a brisk business in language textbooks and white button-down
shirts, and the student body is turning over all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Every Wednesday, more than 200 young people arrive, bid goodbye
to their parents, and settle in for four to 11 weeks. They are
taught how to speak to a stranger about faith and salvation and to
do it in any of 47 languages ranging from Albanian to Vietnamese,
before they are dispatched for two years to locations far from
their homes.
</P>
<P>
   This is the Missionary Training Center of the Mormon church, an
efficient religious engine that has helped propel the Church of
Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints beyond its historic Rocky
Mountain base into a global faith, 10.4 million strong.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989, Mormon missionaries have converted about 300,000
people annually. This year, the church expects to have 60,000
missionaries at work in 163 nations, up from fewer than 30,000 men
and women in 95 countries in 1986. No other North American church
has built so large a missionary force, nor one so focused on
proselytism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The single biggest factor in the Mormon Church's conversion
rate is the size of the missionary force,'' said Gary Shepherd, a
professor of sociology at Oakland University in Rochester, Mich.,
and the co-author of a book on Mormon missionary activity. Shepherd
estimated that, based on church records, a missionary converts an
average of four to seven people a year.
</P>
<P>
   As Mormons have increased their missionary ranks, larger shifts
have been taking place in the broader picture of missionary work.
The number of paid career missionaries sent out by mainline
Protestant churches in North America has declined since the late
1960s to fewer than 4,000, from more than 10,000, according to a
study by Robert T. Coote, assistant to the director at the Overseas
Ministries Study Center in New Haven, Conn. Many of those people
serve as teachers, medical workers or other specialists, as do many
of the 4,200 Roman Catholic missionaries from the United States who
work overseas, according to the U.S. Catholic Mission Association.
</P>
<P>
   But foreign mission activity remains highly competitive. Coote
found that the number of missionaries fielded by conservative,
evangelical churches had grown substantially since World War II. So
too have the number of short-term volunteers like the Mormons.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there has been an increase in the number of
missionaries sent by emerging churches outside the United States,
in such nations as India and Nigeria. Protestant churches in South
Korea have 5,000 missionaries working worldwide, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Here at the training center, the hallways are decorated with
photos of missionaries at work and reproductions of paintings like
one of Joseph Smith, Mormonism's first prophet, kneeling in a grove
of trees in Palmyra, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   The male missionaries-in-training wear newly purchased white
button-downs, the customary dress. The women have more range in
terms of color, but must wear modest dresses with a hemline at
midcalf.
</P>
<P>
   In conversations, they speak with a friendly intensity. In the
center's cafeteria, Michael Nelson, 19, a Texan headed for Brazil,
said that while he was nervous about using his newly acquired
Portuguese, ``I'm not nervous about the faith; I know the Lord will
help me.''
</P>
<P>
   Reviewing her Spanish skills on a computer upstairs, Maryella
Wolford, 21, from Ogden, Utah, said that among the first things
missionaries discussed with serious inquirers into Mormon beliefs
was how to pray. ``We first tell them to address Heavenly Father,
and to give thanks for what they have, to ask for the things they
need and to close in the name of Jesus Christ,'' said Miss Wolford,
who will serve in Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   Among those studying here, men outnumber women about 4-to-1, a
proportion similar to missionaries in the field. Elder Earl C.
Tingey, a member of the Presidency of the Seventy, one of the
highest levels of church leadership, said, ``We teach that every
young man should prepare himself to be worthy to be called as a
missionary.''
</P>
<P>
   The response, while proportionally high, seems to depend on the
historical depth of Mormon culture in an area. Tingey, who is also
executive director of the church's missionary department, said
about one of every two young Mormon men in Utah volunteered for
missionary work. In other parts of the United States, he said, it
is about one in three, while overseas, where a majority of the
church's membership now lives, it is close to one in six. Church
officials say the lower ratio outside the United States may stem
from financial factors; in some nations relatively few young men
have money to contribute to their mission.
</P>
<P>
   Men must be at least 19 to go on a mission; women must be 21.
They are asked to be financially self-sufficient, and either they
or their families must pay $375 a month into a church fund that
supports the missionary work. In a church that vests authority in
men, missionary service is regarded as purely optional for women.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the girls, it's a choice,'' said Eve Speer, 21, of
Tremonton, Utah, bound for mission work in Dallas. ``You do a lot
of prayer and a lot of talking to sister missionaries.''
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After they arrive at the center, the missionaries are assigned
to a district, a group of eight to 12 young people who take classes
together and lend one another emotional support and religious
encouragement.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Speer's district was studying ``The Doctrine and
Covenants,'' divine revelations Smith said he received about the
church's structure and theology.
</P>
<P>
   Within her group was Lincoln Young, 25, bound for Halifax, Nova
Scotia, who had been converted eight years ago by missionaries who
went to his family's home in Guyana.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the image of Mormon missionaries as door-knockers,
conversions like Young's are not typical. Sitting in the center's
cafeteria, half a dozen young men said their teachers had told them
that cold calls on strangers' doors were the least effective way to
make converts. It works far better, they said, to have a church
member invite friends or relatives over to meet and talk to
missionaries.
</P>
<P>
   The men in the cafeteria were scheduled to leave soon for
Brazil, for a month of training at a newly opened center in Sao
Paulo, one of 16 smaller training centers that the church has
recently opened around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials say Brazil and other parts of Latin America are
hot growth areas for Mormonism, in contrast to Europe, where
conversions come slowly. The situation has historical antecedents
in the 1830s and 1840s, when the Mormons, then based in the
Midwest, ran their first international missions to the industrial
cities of western England. Then and now, Mormon missionaries have
done best in growing urban areas (like Latin America's cities), to
which people have moved from rural settings, leaving behind
traditional social and religious ties, while still seeking
structure and community.
</P>
<P>
   Missionaries are advised to avoid the hostile and those who
simply want to engage in theological debate. A few missionaries
drop out, and when they do, it is often because of physical or
emotional problems, or family emergencies, Tingey said. He said he
did not know how many such cases occurred, but thought them to be a
small number.
</P>
<P>
   The eight young men who gathered for instruction in Tagalog, the
main Filipino language, were all upbeat. They listened and watched
as the instructor, Daniel Nabrotzky, 26, once a missionary in the
Philippines, ran a hand through his hair as he recited the verb for
comb, then touched his chin as he gave the word for shave.
</P>
<P>
   During a pause, Chad Schiess, 19, said he had grown up in
Victor, Idaho, near the Wyoming border, and had never been farther
away from home than northern Utah. He will soon be living in Quezon
City, a suburb of Metropolitan Manila.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to learn a language,'' he said. ``I'd never heard of
Tagalog until now, but it's pretty awesome.''

<P>
   SIACHEN GLACIER, in the western Himalayas _ For 15 blustery,
shivering years, the Indian and Pakistani armies have been fighting
a war along the frigid peaks of the western Himalayas _ in an area
named for the Siachen Glacier and known as the battleground on the
roof of the world.
</P>
<P>
   For a soldier, this is where hell freezes over, a 46-mile river
of slow-moving ice surrounded by stupendous towers of snow.
Temperatures swoon to 50 below, and sudden blizzards can bury field
artillery in minutes. Men sleep in ice caves or igloos and breathe
air so spare of oxygen that it sends their hearts into a mad
gallop. Fainting spells and pounding headaches are frequent.
Frostbite chews its way through digits and limbs.
</P>
<P>
   The enemy is hard to see in the crags and craters in the vast
whiteness _ and harder to hit. Rifles must be thawed repeatedly
over kerosene stoves, and machine guns need to be primed with
boiling water. At altitudes of 18,000 feet, mortar shells fly
unpredictable and extraordinary distances, swerving erratically
when met by sledgehammer gusts.
</P>
<P>
   While some troops fall to hostile fire, far more perish from
avalanches and missteps into crevasses that nature has camouflaged
with snow. This is especially the case in springtime, as the sun
licks away several feet of ice and opens new underground cracks and
seams.
</P>
<P>
   But for all these logistical peculiarities, the Siachen conflict
might be thought of as just another low-intensity border war _ were
it not being fought between the world's two newest nuclear powers.
Their combat over a barren, uninhabited nether world of
questionable strategic value is a forbidding symbol of their
lingering irreconcilability.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a struggle of two bald men over a comb,'' said
Stephen P. Cohen, an authority on the Indian subcontinent at the
Brookings Institution. ``Siachen is the epitome of the worst
aspects of the relationship. These are two countries that are
paired on a road to Oslo or Hiroshima, and at this point they could
go either way.''
</P>
<P>
   Since gaining independence in 1947, Pakistan, which is
overwhelmingly Muslim, and India, which is predominantly Hindu,
have been enemies with a bent toward military confrontation. In
1949, after the first of three wars, the nations agreed to a
cease-fire line that unfortunately stopped short of the remote
massifs of north-central Kashmir _ a disputed area on the map where
India, Pakistan and China rub shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   The wording in the agreement merely said the line was to
continue ``north to the glaciers.'' For two decades, this vague
phrasing was of more concern to mapmakers than soldiers, but in the
1970s several groups of mountaineers in down outerwear began
trekking through the region. If they could survive the cold and
elevation, so might an army. Siachen became another reason for two
nervous neighbors to be reflexively suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   On April 13, 1984, the Indian army made a ``pre-emptive'' move
into the glacier and the peaks and passes around it. Within weeks,
Pakistani forces swept in to oppose them, but the Indians have been
able to hold on to the tactical advantage of the high ground.
</P>
<P>
   Most of India's many outposts are west of the glacier along the
Saltoro Range of the Karakoram Mountains. These pickets are
reachable to an enemy only after a strenuous climb and then a
frontal assault, a near-hopeless task in such thin air. After 50
strides, even a well-conditioned man is gasping for breath with his
muscles in a tremble.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years of refrigerated combat have brought only 15 years
of hardened stalemate. The Pakistanis cannot get up to the glacier;
the Indians cannot come down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can win, no matter how long we fight,'' said Maj. Gen.
V.S. Budhwar, the Indian commander in Leh, whose region includes
Siachen. ``But this is our land. It is a portion of our
nation-state, and we will not cede it.''
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, some vital strategic importance is assigned to the
Siachen area, with hypothetical aggressors flooding across mountain
highways. More often, the conflict is described as a simple matter
of principle. Imagine, people say, how America would respond if the
Russians overran even a small, barren chunk of Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   ``Siachen is an awful place where you can step on a thin layer
of snow and, poof, down you go 200 feet,'' said Gen. Khalid Mehmood
Arif, the retired former vice chief of Pakistan's military. ``But
no nation ever wants to lose a single inch of territory, so Siachen
has psychological and political importance. It's value is in ego
and prestige.''  &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Arduous to live in, the Siachen area is beautiful to look at.
Some of the world's tallest mountains fill the landscape, their
snowy tops giving way to streams of white that glitter against the
black and purple rock. It is a moonscape of mesmerizing pinnacles
and ridges and drops. Ice formations rise a mile high. Clouds seem
at arm's reach.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian base camp is at the very start of the glacier, which
gently curves upward like a giant white tongue. Barracks, helipads,
supply sheds, satellite dishes, a hospital and Hindu shrines are
spread across several acres. It is clear the Indians have been here
awhile and are ready to stay. The command post is carpeted.
Curtains hang along the windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the heights,'' said Brig. P.C. Katoch, who runs the
operation. In contrast with the superior vista those heights
afford, he said, the Pakistani soldier sees nothing: ``He hears a
helicopter and shoots. He hears artillery and shoots. It's stupid.
He doesn't know where he's shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   But being king of the hill is costly. The Pakistanis can
resupply most of their posts by road and pack mule. At their
forward positions, some as high as 21,000 feet, the Indians must
rely on helicopters. The whirlybirds strain against the altitude
like oversized bumble bees. Many an air drop is swallowed by the
snow.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides deploy about 3,000 soldiers. The Pakistanis refuse to
divulge how much they spend in Siachen; the Indians estimate the
cost at $350,000 to $500,000 a day, said Lt. Gen. R.K. Sawhney, the
army's director general of military intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Transporting kerosene is one major expense. Some Indian soldiers
live in igloos made of fiberglass panels. Six soldiers can sleep in
jigsaw configurations, crowded into a room the size of a king-sized
bed. Others live in ice tunnels gouged out with a pickax.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, small kerosene stoves are the hearths they huddle
around. The hissing competes with the howling of the wind. Black
smoke seems to color everything, including a man's spit.
</P>
<P>
   The highest perches are occupied by only a handful of soldiers,
and sleeping is rarely done at night, for this is the most likely
time for the enemy to sneak up. Sentry duty is bleak work. Hot
water bottles do not stay hot for long. A relay must be set up to
exchange frozen rifles for defrosted ones.
</P>
<P>
   During storms, the heavy snowfall seems as thick as long, white
drapery. The wind does pinwheels, and the basics of a hard life
gets that much harder. ``At my post, you have to use a crawl trench
to get to the toilet,'' said Cpl. Joginder Singh. ``When it snows,
the trench fills up and you have to stand. The enemy can see you
and that's how you die.''
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to know how many men have been killed. Some
local news reports put casualty totals for both sides in the
thousands, but this seems based on conjecture. The Pakistanis do
not release such details, and the Indians say they have lost only
the 616 soldiers whose names appear on a stone memorial at the base
camp.
</P>
<P>
   The inscription reads: ``Quartered in snow, silent to remain.
When the bugle calls, they shall rise and march again.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since they were separated at birth, India and Pakistan have
fought over the territory of Jammu and Kashmir, a stunningly lush
area that touches both of their borders.
</P>
<P>
   In the complicated and emotional give-and-take that accompanied
partition in 1947, Kashmir, a state with a large Muslim majority,
ended up within India. To Pakistan, this seemed unreasonable. The
infant nations were drawn into combat.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Kashmir is the issue that most heats the blood. The
Indians claim the area while the Pakistanis argue that the
Kashmiris must decide their own future through a plebiscite. Both
countries maintain formidable armies near the cease-fire line that
splits the territory in two. The killing may slow but it never
stops.
</P>
<P>
   Ownership of the mountainous and sparsely-populated northeast is
a particular conundrum. From the Indian point of view, the language
of the 1949 agreement is eminently clear: ``north to the glaciers''
means a line going slightly northwest along the natural watershed
of the Saltoro peaks. The Pakistanis are equally sure: the phrasing
intends for the line to continue northeasterly as it does through
the rest of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   ``The roots of the Kashmir problem are very tangled, but as far
as the glacier goes, this is simply a matter of Pakistanis sneaking
their way into a place that doesn't belong to them,'' said India's
Lt. Gen. M.L. Chibber, retired, who is central to the Siachen saga.
</P>
<P>
   An amiable man who left the army in 1985, Chibber now follows
guru Sai Baba and speaks easily about the futility of war. In 1978,
however, he was a commander with responsibility for Siachen. He was
alarmed to learn that the Pakistanis were accompanying mountaineers
to the glacier. Just as troubling were maps printed in the West.
They showed Siachen as part of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   By the early '80s, both armies were sending expeditions into the
area, and suspicions accumulated like fresh snow. In late 1983, the
Indians became convinced the Pakistanis were about to seize the
glacier, Chibber said. This was inferred from intercepted
communiques.
</P>
<P>
   If further evidence was needed, he said, it came when India sent
procurers to Europe to buy cold weather gear. They ran into
Pakistanis doing the same shopping.
</P>
<P>
   India's ``pre-emptive'' takeover of Siachen was called Operation
Meghdoot after the divine cloud messenger in a Sanskrit play. It
soon came to seem a burdensome success. Like overeager chess
players, the Indians had failed to plan several moves ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one had ever carried out military operations at these
altitudes and temperatures, so we figured after the summer ended,
we'd have to pull out,'' Chibber said. ``But with the first snows,
we realized it was possible to stay up there all winter. If we
left, the Pakistanis would take the glacier, and then we'd never
get it back.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the conflict's first years, with the armies inexperienced at
such a cold war, the number of casualties mounted quickly. Valiant,
if foolhardy, assaults were attempted. Frostbite, snow blindness
and pulmonary and cerebral edema took a huge toll.
</P>
<P>
   Daring raids are now rare, the Pakistanis say, though the
Indians often boast of victorious defensive skirmishes, killing
three here and a dozen there. Each side makes claims the other
vigorously denies.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the blasts of artillery and mortar shells are the
war's steady cadence. ``We fire at them and they fire at us, but
this is not a place where the usual calculations of trajectory and
distance apply,'' said Capt. Hamid Mukhtar, a Pakistani artillery
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Mukhtar was serving at a forward post at 18,000 feet, near a
ridge line known as the Conway Saddle. ``There are crevasses on
either side of these paths,'' he cautioned as he walked. ``Step
into the wrong place and you will go to meet God beneath the
snow.''
</P>
<P>
   Daily patrolling is necessary, if for no other reason than to
tread on a marked trail so it will not disappear. In February, in a
typical catastrophe, an avalanche crushed 13 Pakistani soldiers
tethered together with rope. A single survivor led the search that
later recovered the pristine dead, their bodies preserved as if
locked in cold storage.
</P>
<P>
   Melting leads to snow slides. The noontime temperature in early
spring was 10 below, but the sun was bright enough to rapidly turn
an exposed nose the color of a radish. Sweat is a problem because
it becomes ice in a soldier's gloves and socks. Frostbite is then
quick with its work.
</P>
<P>
   Even after a day's exertion, most soldiers have little appetite
at these heights. Rations come out of tin cans. Fresh produce is
rare. An orange freezes to the hardness of a baseball; a potato
cannot be dented with a hammer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hardships, both sides report an oversupply of
volunteers. Stints in Siachen usually last three months or less.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my country's soil, and whether something grows here or
not, I would gladly die to protect it,'' said Cpl. Mohammad
Shafique, a Pakistani.
</P>
<P>
   Few soldiers know much about the other side's territorial
claims, but they seem untroubled by doubt of the enemy's murderous
skulduggery. While many people in India and Pakistan hope for
rapprochement, others merely heap fresh animosity upon the old.
Evil is presumed.
</P>
<P>
   Budhwar, the Indian regional commander, said Pakistanis suffer
from a ``deformed growth,'' becoming brainwashed in school ``with
all the dos and don'ts'' of Islamic fundamentalism. ``Their very
existence depends on being inimical to India,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of his counterparts is Brig. Nusrat Khan Sial, who commands
Pakistan's Siachen operation from the city of Skardu. He called the
Indians ``cowards'' whose Hindu beliefs lack reverence for human
life. He said he suspects they have used chemical weapons in
Siachen, which the Indians vehemently deny.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be the Indians, not us, who will trigger this
situation up to the level where both sides resort to nuclear
weapons,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, both nations tested ballistic missiles as they
develop enough tit-for-tat firepower to give an adversary pause.
Following the example of superpowers, they are pursuing peace
through nuclear deterrence, their leaders say: Smaller disputes are
less likely to provoke all-out wars when the possible outcome
includes annihilation.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a less costly path toward peace is being
undertaken. Earlier this year, with brass bands and polite
embraces, India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, made a
heralded bus trip to Pakistan and met with Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   More talks are in the offing, but optimism is in irregular
supply.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Siachen itself has been the subject of seven
``major rounds of talks,'' said Robert G. Wirsing, a scholar at the
University of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Under various governments ruled by various parties, negotiators
have agreed that the conflict is futile _ and some have even called
it lunatic. But one side or the other always has been too afraid of
a double cross to complete a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic politics are also a hitch. Any compromise involving
Kashmir looms like a lit fuse, especially to unstable governments.
</P>
<P>
   So the two armies fight on, proud of conquering the elements if
not each other. Their doctors have become experts at high-altitude
medicine, their helicopter pilots adroit at skirting the cliffs.
Solar panels are affixed to some igloos.
</P>
<P>
   On the Indian side, a kerosene pipeline is being completed. A
ski lift will ferry soldiers across the canyons. A pulley system
has begun to hoist supplies up the mountainsides. Bacteria are
eating human waste in machines called biodigesters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have become specialists at high-altitude fighting _
probably the best in the world,'' boasted Sawhney, sounding as
self-congratulatory as his Pakistani counterparts. ``We can
tolerate the harsh elements. We have made livable conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   We are prepared, both sides say, to battle on the roof of the
world forever.

<TEXT>
<P>
   For nearly three decades, in good times and in bad, young black
men with little education and few skills lost ground. Facing high
unemployment, falling pay and persistent discrimination, a
depressingly large number never really joined the work force or
drifted out of it, getting by on handouts, hustling or crime.
</P>
<P>
   But now the nation's job boom is drawing many of these young men
_ perhaps the most economically disadvantaged, socially alienated
group in America _ back into the economic mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   Low unemployment and tight labor markets have always encouraged
upward mobility. The surprise, researchers say, is how dramatic the
gains have been.
</P>
<P>
   A new study of low-wage men in 322 metropolitan areas by Richard
Freeman at Harvard University and William Rodgers III at the
College of William and Mary shows that black men aged 16 to 24 with
a high school education or less _ many saddled with prison records
_ are working in greater numbers, earning bigger paychecks and
committing fewer crimes than in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Poor blacks never lost faith in work, education and individual
effort,'' said Jennifer Hochschild, a political scientist at
Princeton University and author of ``Facing Up to the American
Dream: Race, Class and the Soul of the Nation.'' ``What's different
now is that they can do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Far too many young black men are still idle or in prison. But
the surge in legitimate employment has gone hand in hand with a
drop in criminal activity, which has long clouded the job prospects
of young black men. Indeed, crime has fallen rapidly in regions
where joblessness has fallen most.
</P>
<P>
   In the 14 areas where unemployment has been below 4 percent in
every year since 1992 _ places like the Raleigh-Durham area in
North Carolina; Rochester, Minn., and Des Moines, Iowa _ the
percentage of young, less-educated black men who are working has
jumped from 52 percent to 64 percent. The figures exclude young men
who are still in school and those who are in prison, who represent
7 percent of those between the ages of 20 and 24. But the
improvement does not simply reflect the fact that many of those
with the worst job prospects are now behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used the variation across cities to see what might happen
at a national level if we were able to get national unemployment
below 4 percent for a long time,'' said Rodgers, who pointed out
that by 1998, 146 of the nation's 322 metropolitan areas had
unemployment rates below 4 percent. In 1992, only 19 areas had
jobless rates that low. ``It allows us to see what kind of
employment and wage gains these men might experience.''
</P>
<P>
   In 15 other metropolitan areas where unemployment fell by five
percentage points or more _ places like Pittsfield, Mass., Flint,
Mich., and Naples, Fla. _the corresponding improvement was from 42
percent to 51 percent. Uniformly, the gains for young black men
outstripped the much more modest gains for all young men, including
whites, and for black men in their prime working years.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Burnett, 19, is typical of many young blacks who have
benefited from the extended period of low unemployment in
fast-growing parts of the United States. He graduated from an
inner-city high school in Raleigh, N.C., in June 1997, when the
local unemployment rate was 2.2 percent. After working at a series
of temporary jobs for about a year and completing a federally
financed job readiness program, he landed a $7-an-hour, full-time
position as a front-desk clerk at an Embassy Suites hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Now Burnett is planning to study hotel management part time with
tuition help from his employer. ``The sky's the limit,'' he said.
``No one can hold me back but me.''
</P>
<P>
   Freeman, one of the nation's top experts on black youth
unemployment, said: ``This shows how critical it is not to give up
on these guys. If you give these kids a break, they come back.''
</P>
<P>
   The gains are coming at a time when affirmative action,
preferential contracting for minorities and most job training
programs are no longer expanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is more powerful than any government program,''
Freeman said. ``The question is: `Can we keep it up?' ''
</P>
<P>
   In the sharply segregated 1950s _ hardly the best of times for
young blacks _there were more opportunities at the bottom of the
economic ladder. Young blacks and young whites were equally likely
to hold jobs, although young blacks' hourly pay was roughly
one-third lower than that of whites. By the late 1960s, the
earnings gap between young blacks and whites had narrowed to less
than 10 percentage points, but the fraction of black youths with
jobs had fallen sharply. At that point, the collapse in work among
young black men in inner cities accelerated, the pay gap widened
again, and neither the civil rights movement nor major federal job
training programs did much to reverse the devastation. The pay gap
peaked in the early 1990s at more than 20 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, businesses drifted even farther away from
cities, the computer revolution increased skill requirements,
growing numbers of women and immigrants competed for entry-level
jobs, and the ranks of young black prison inmates continued to
swell. To many people, the outlook for a turnaround in the job
prospects of young black men seemed remote.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have so many strikes against them,'' said Hazel Logan, a
grandmother of five who runs a jobs program in Raleigh. ``Whatever
the totem pole is, they are at the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, one of the most visible signs of change is on one
basketball court at the Durham YMCA. Around 400 black men between
ages 19 and 25 from the inner cities of Raleigh, Durham and Chapel
Hill used to take part in a midnight basketball league where
networking and interviewing tips were as much on the agenda as foul
shots. Now, says James Johnson, director of the Urban Investment
Strategies Center at the University of North Carolina, ``We've had
difficulty getting enough people to play because they are in the
job market.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Michael Tavernise, manager of the Employment Security Commission
office in Raleigh, said, ``Employers are hiring people that two,
three, five years ago they weren't hiring.'' The overall
unemployment rate in the Raleigh-Durham region recently dipped to
1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As businesses struggle to fill jobs, other groups of poorly
educated workers are reaping even bigger gains. Half of all single
mothers, including many young black women, are working now compared
with fewer than one-third at the start of the decade, according to
David Ellwood, an economist at the John F. Kennedy School of
government at Harvard University and a former adviser to President
Clinton on welfare issues. He attributes the surge in work to new
policies like limits on welfare and pay subsidies for working
parents, as well as the vibrant job market. ``It's unprecedented,''
he said. ``Nothing like it has ever happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Few expect a revival of the naive optimism of the early 1960s,
when some liberal policy-makers predicted that just a few more
years of strong economic growth would erase the problems of young
black men. Those problems are still daunting. Although unemployment
among young black men of all education levels is lower now than at
the peak of the 1980s expansion _ 17 percent compared with 20
percent _ it is more than twice that for young white men.
</P>
<P>
   And even though more young black men are staying in school
longer and entering the work force later _ just like their white
counterparts _ some 19 percent of all black men between ages 16 and
24 are not in school or working. That is a smaller proportion than
in 1992, but still slightly higher than at the peak of the last
expansion and also twice the comparable figures for young white
men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see people I went to school with and I see them talking
outside, hanging around, not doing anything,'' said Burnett, the
hotel clerk in Durham.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Murray, the conservative social analyst at the American
Enterprise Institute and author of ``Losing Ground: American Social
Policy, 1950-1980'' and, with Richard Herrnstein, ``The Bell Curve:
Intelligence and Class Structure in American Life,'' views the
persistence of idleness during boom times as a sign that ``the
underclass is as big as it's ever been and may still be growing.''
</P>
<P>
   But these days few experts are as pessimistic as Murray.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for cautious optimism is that overall unemployment
has fallen further and stayed down longer than in the 1980s. The
longer the labor markets stay tight, the more time the young have
to acquire contacts, work experience and marketable skills with
which to weather the next downturn. ``The current job market is
giving young men an opportunity to build up some confidence,''
Rodgers said.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason to expect some of the gains to last is that
entry-level work has become more rewarding financially. Prior to
the 1990s, pay for less educated men had been declining in real
terms for more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   At the peak of the 1980s economic expansion, according to a
now-classic survey conducted by Freeman and Lawrence Katz, also at
Harvard, more than half of young black men in hot job markets like
Boston judged their prospects in the underground economy superior
to any legitimate employment. Since 1992, by contrast, the hourly
pay of young, less educated black men has climbed as much as 15
percent in the metropolitan areas with the tightest labor markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still big racial differences in employment outcomes,
but the improvements are encouraging because they show that these
young men aren't totally isolated from the world of work,'' Ronald
Ferguson, an economist at the Kennedy School of government, said.
``When the economy is hot enough, employers hire these folks.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONROE COUNTY, Ill. _ In the week of her 95th birthday, Emma
Buck weeded her century-old rosebushes with a 120-year-old German
sickle and fetched water from a wood bucket in the well house _
cool, clean spring water bearing the slight taste of oak.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a skirt, always a skirt, and two coarse woolen coats
stitched together, she sharpened scythes on a foot-operated
grinding wheel, her life's patterns and surroundings little changed
from the 1840s, when her great-grandfather came from Germany to
this fertile land along the Mississippi River and, unaccustomed to
the midday heat, cradled wheat in the moonlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ja, well,'' Miss Buck, slight as a hummingbird, likes to say
in heavily accented English, leaning on canes or a tilling shovel
as she slowly walks around her family farm, past the blacksmith's
shop, the smokehouse, the butchering shed, the threshing barn and
the outdoor bake oven, thought to be the only surviving one in the
state. ``I've seen it all before. It's nothing new to me.''
</P>
<P>
   But to historians, Emma Buck's farm, which has never seen a
tractor, is ``a remarkable survival of pioneer days in Illinois,''
in the words of the Landmarks Preservation Council of Illinois,
which declared it one of the state's 10 most endangered sites last
year. The farmstead that Miss Buck _ who never married _ still
tends, knees willing, with equal parts frugality, conservatism and
gumption, is a rare remnant of America's rural agricultural
heritage.
</P>
<P>
   As farmland and buildings disappear, so do their mute
testimonies of the times, still vivid in Ms. Buck's sickle-sharp
memory, when horses threshed wheat around a stone pivot and soap
was made at home from suet, ashes and lye.
</P>
<P>
   Hers is one of those places where one can still encounter wood
butter churns, a horse-drawn surrey, a rope bed with a corn shuck
mattress, hobnail boots and hoops for a Conestoga wagon in the
rafters.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been little written on the ordinary lives of
ordinary farm people, who knew a world completely different than
our own,'' said Lowell Soike, a historian with the State Historical
Society of Iowa. He points out that the preservation movement has
largely focused on cities and towns, not rural landmarks. Family
farmsteads as intact as Emma Buck's ``are rare windows onto those
earlier lives and the way farms are changing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What the Buck farm represents to Annie Rieken, director of the
Heritage Foundation of Monroe County, ``is the history of what's
lost,'' Ms. Rieken said. ``She's the last of the last of the
last.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no official mechanism for historic preservation of
privately-owned farms, and the Buck farm's fate is unknown. Miss
Buck has lived alone on the farm, about 35 miles south of St.
Louis, since her sister Anna died seven years ago. Its future is in
the hands of Miss Buck's 93-year-old brother, Albert, who inherited
it as the only son. He now lives in a Chicago retirement home and
is ill.
</P>
<P>
   The farm is threatened by suburban sprawl, including a new
17-hole golf course that opened less than a mile away. The
population of Monroe County is expected to double in 20 years.
There were 804 farms in 1982; by 1997, the number had dropped to
556, according to census data.
</P>
<P>
   To spend some time with Miss Buck, who still lacks indoor
plumbing (though neighbors gave her a freezer and an electric stove
a few years ago), is to feel the evocative power of a place whose
doors have closed in on history.
</P>
<P>
   In the cellar, redware and salt-glazed crocks line the shelves,
as if waiting to be replenished with pickles and sauerkraut. In the
smokehouse, a heavy trough, to scald the fur off carcasses, still
hangs from a pulley, and the rafters are filled with copper kettles
for making sausages and apple butter.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was German business,'' she said. ``What would you do with
all these things? Throw them out?''
</P>
<P>
   The horse-drawn sleigh is there. So is the Civil War coat with
silver buttons, the one children wrapped around their feet to keep
warm. ``We didn't go away very much, except to church,'' she
recalled. ``If there was a heavy coat of snow, you just glided
along. We didn't follow the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Her maternal great-grandparents, Christian and Christina Henke,
farmers from East Friesland, came by boat from New Orleans and
settled on 80 acres in 1841. They were among the many Germans who
flocked to this corner of Illinois, where restaurants still serve
pickled beets and dumplings and the landscape is dotted with
European-style stone bridges and churches.
</P>
<P>
   Her grandparents built the log cabin that Miss Buck lives in.
Her grandmother described how German settlers, hearing there was
sickness aboard her immigrant ship from Germany, rowed into the
harbor and tossed oranges onto the deck. ``Life is like that
ship,'' Miss Buck said now. ``Sometimes it blows forward, sometimes
back. And just when you think all is lost, someone throws an orange
on your deck.''
</P>
<P>
   As was the custom among German immigrants in this area, Emma and
Anna Buck worked side-by-side with their father, Fred, an ingenious
toolmaker who died in 1963 after a long illness. (Her mother died
much earlier.) As a girl Emma walked three miles across the fields
to sell eggs at the general store, where double-wide trailers now
stand. An ``outdoors person,'' she often shot groundhogs with a
shotgun.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Amish, also of German origin, who shun modern
technology for religious reasons, the Buck family stuck to the old
ways, from horse-drawn harvesters to butter churns, out of
conservatism and stubborn resolve. Her father's token effort at
modernization was ``the light factory,'' as Miss Buck called it, an
acetylene plant that generated gas for lighting and tended to blow
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did it the way we wanted to _ Father's way _ that was
all,'' said Miss Buck. . ``I never wanted new things. If I had
them, they probably wouldn't serve me the way the old things did.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But she remains clear-eyed about the past, even the dismal job
of raking soot from the cast-iron stove with a corncob. Her
brother, Albert, in contrast, was a scholarly man who left the farm
to become a minister and who played the mandolin. Her girlhood
dreams reveal themselves more privately in scores of gentle,
colored-pencil drawings of bluebirds fishing in dewdrops, based on
1920s magazine advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   She says she never regretted not marrying or having children.
``I had what I wanted here,'' said Miss Buck, for whom
introspection is a luxury. ``We were never the patting kind.''
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, after reading about Annie Rieken's local
preservation efforts, she wrote her a letter. ``You are probably
surprised to get this little note,'' the letter read. ``My
great-grandfather came from Germany and settled here ... when John
Tyler was president. There are many antiques here that were used
then. Sincerely, Emma Buck.''
</P>
<P>
   As the farm's lone curator, Miss Buck does what she can,
weeding, pruning trees, fixing the split-rail fences with her
father's hand tools and, until recently, repairing roofs and
greasing the hubs of the old McCormick sidebinder. She tends to the
garden but doesn't farm herself, renting the fields to a neighbor.
Beneath her knee socks and bloomers, her left leg is still swollen
where she accidentally cut herself two years ago with the sickle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen old places where the doors flop open,'' she said of
the nearby farms going to seed. ``The places look deserted. I just
stayed here and did the work that had to be done. What else would I
do?''
</P>
<P>
   But with each season, more knots fall out of planks in the barn
and cellar shelves collapse from rot.
</P>
<P>
   Money must be raised ``to stabilize and restore the buildings,''
Ms. Rieken said, and she estimated the cost at about $300,000. A
more immediate concern, she said, is ``recording the stories Emma
has on the tip of her tongue.''
</P>
<P>
   Soike says some family farms have been saved when county
historical societies took them under their wing, with the owners'
or heirs' blessing. State and local preservationists would like to
avoid the now-common spectacle of antique dealers with bulging
wallets swooping in for the butter churns and blacksmithing
bellows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some things deserve to be preserved the way they are,'' said
Otto Faulbaum, a local lawyer and preservationist. ``Not everything
needs to be sanitized.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking for Buck, who was too ill to be interviewed, the Rev.
Robert L. Randall, a minister in Elmhurst, Ill., and trustee for
Albert Buck's estate, said that the Buck farm ``is not going to be
sold off to developers or realtors.''
</P>
<P>
   One idea is to turn it into a museum that would tell the story
of Emma Buck's family and the German farming heritage of the
region. Such ``living history farms,'' which now number over 500
across the country, are growing, as are antique farm-implement
shows and threshing bees.
</P>
<P>
   As farms are sold off or consolidated, nostalgia for the rural
past grows, whether for country landmarks or old-time equipment,
said John Walter, senior editor of Successful Farming Magazine,
which sponsors a barn preservation program with the National Trust
for Historic Preservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more financial stress among farmers,'' he said, ``the more
there seems to be a need to hold on to the things that have made
rural life what it's been.''
</P>
<P>
   For Miss Buck, though, holding on to the old ways is
increasingly difficult. Age can be unkind both to people and
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   She is reminded of this whenever her knees stiffen up in the
rain, or whenever she eats store-bought bread. ``It all tastes like
dough to me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In her outdoor bake oven, its bricks collapsed from weather and
time, she used to bake the dark, crusty bread according to her
great-grandmother's recipe. Its decrepit condition has sorely
tested her patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 100 years,'' she said, ``things just don't work
anymore.''

TIME RUNNING OUT FOR NATO TO PLAN A KOSOVO INVASION
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT and MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Even with the Clinton administration's
decision to push for 50,000 NATO troops on Kosovo's border, the
alliance will still face a choice within three weeks about whether
to begin preparations for a larger and more powerful force that
could fight its way into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The 50,000 troops that the United States wants NATO to send
would be used as peacekeepers in the event of a settlement with
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   They would include thousands of combat engineers, military
police and civil affairs troops that would be used to help rebuild
the shattered province of Kosovo and maintain order there.
</P>
<P>
   The troops would not have the armored punch of an invasion
force, which NATO officials said could number over 150,000 if the
initial contingent of peacekeepers and support troops are included.
</P>
<P>
   Marshaling such a potent force would be a mammoth undertaking,
which would include identifying the units that would be sent,
mobilizing reserves and shipping tons of armor and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the alliance has much to do and very little time to do
it if it wants to keep open the option of deploying an invasion
force to bring the war to an end before winter sets in. Further,
there is still intense opposition from Germany and some other NATO
members to using ground troops in a combat role.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the next two to three weeks, we need a political
breakthrough on a peace resolution,'' said a veteran NATO diplomat.
``If not, some tough choices on ground forces will have to be
made.''
</P>
<P>
   The urgency over making a decision on ground troops is being
driven now mainly by NATO's goal to return 850,000 refugees outside
the country and 580,000 displaced persons inside Kosovo to their
homes before subfreezing temperatures return to the Balkans in
October.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with a dozen senior diplomats and other top officials
at NATO headquarters here suggest that the facade of public
optimism among the allies is tempered by private fears. With each
passing day, they say, concern grows that public opinion, the
ability to hold the alliance together, and the dispersal of Kosovar
Albanian refugees are working against them.
</P>
<P>
   Even deploying the more modest 50,000-troop peacekeeping force
may not be easy. The alliance's political body, the North Atlantic
Council, will meet as early as Tuesday to consider the plan.
</P>
<P>
   But there are plenty of thorny issues. Allied ambassadors have
to identify which nations would contribute the troops and
equipment. Since combat engineers and military police are generally
in the military reserves, NATO nations would have to make the
politically difficult decision about whether to mobilize them.
</P>
<P>
   Further, some NATO nations may be nervous about authorizing the
deployment of ground troops _ even peacekeeping ones _ at a time
when diplomats are trying to explore a solution.
</P>
<P>
   NATO nations would have to make a separate decision to actually
send the force. Milosevic will be closely monitoring the alliance's
moves to see if NATO has the determination to end the war on its
terms.
</P>
<P>
   It was Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's military commander, who pressed
the allies to deploy the 50,000-soldier peacekeeping force to the
borders of Kosovo as quickly as possible. He wanted the force to be
ready in case of a peace settlement, but also to place added
pressure on Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington last week, Clark gave Defense Secretary William
Cohen and Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff, the same warning he has already delivered to NATO
ambassadors: Time is running to plan a ground campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration approved the proposal, seeking in
part to deflect the political pressure it has been under to declare
its hand on the use of combat troops.
</P>
<P>
   To achieve NATO's goal, Britain last week revived the idea of
sending combat troops but not until the Yugoslav troops had been
weakened by months more or air attacks. If the air war and
diplomacy fail to end the crisis soon, a ground war would be the
only way to guarantee the return of most of the refugees before
winter sets in, they say.
</P>
<P>
   But Germany, among other allies, vowed to block a land campaign,
calling it ``unthinkable.''
</P>
<P>
   The administration has been wary of suggestions involving ground
troops in a combat role, and American officials have tried to avoid
public discussion of the sensitive subject.
</P>
<P>
   Some allied officials have seized on reports of Yugoslav army
deserters and new signs of Yugoslavia's willingness to cut a peace
deal as indications that the air war is finally having an impact on
Milosevic. But many seasoned diplomats here concede that this may
be the wishful thinking of an alliance fighting its first war, and
learning on a steep curve at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a half-war, fought for half a result, and that's where
we're heading,'' said one senior NATO diplomat. ``Milosevic is
still sitting there.''
</P>
<P>
   The calendar isn't the only pressure on NATO diplomats and
generals. Deadly mistakes like the bombings of a hospital, a prison
and the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade are chipping away at public
support for the war in many countries.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should be great care taken to avoid tragic errors that
would increase the sense of uneasiness and impossibility to
understand among our public opinion,'' Prime Minister Massimo
D'Alema of Italy said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The logistics of returning refugees to their homes are also
daunting. ``The longer the refugees are gone from their homes, and
the more they're spread out, the harder it will be to get them back
in,'' said one senior NATO diplomat. ``In the long run, Milosevic
may win.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Several diplomatic initiatives that could defuse the crisis are
lagging. President Clinton and NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana
expressed pessimism last week about a swift agreement on a U.N.
Security Council resolution that encompasses the allies' demands to
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of work has to be done both militarily and politically
in order to have that possibility of a debate,'' Solana said.
</P>
<P>
   But negotiators from the so-called G-8 countries met in Bonn,
Germany, last week in an effort to write a draft resolution that
would win the support of China and Russia, both of which hold
Security Council vetoes.
</P>
<P>
   The parties are still far apart on key issues like whether all
Yugoslav military and security forces would withdraw from Kosovo,
and the composition of an international peacekeeping force that
would escort the refugees home.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, talks between a Russian envoy, Viktor Chernomyrdin,
and Milosevic have yielded few concrete results, largely because
NATO has so far been unwilling to compromise on what amount to
terms of unconditional surrender.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weakness of all this is that Milosevic sits there with the
key to a diplomatic solution,'' said one senior NATO diplomat.
``And he has shown an unexpected capacity to absorb our attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   A special group of military analysts in Clark's headquarters and
in Washington are poring over reconnaissance photos and
handicapping the strength of the Yugoslav forces in Kosovo down to
individual battalions.
</P>
<P>
   This analysis, called battle damage assessment, is an art, not a
science. The intelligence experts must also incorporate Yugoslav
forces' skill at camouflaging their weaponry, dispersing into small
groups that are harder to identify, and, according to Western
accounts, using refugees as human shields.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement last week by Maj. Gen. Walter Jertz, a NATO
military spokesman, that allied bombing had destroyed 31 percent of
Yugoslavia's tanks, artillery and other heavy weaponry in Kosovo,
served two purposes.
</P>
<P>
   It sought to support NATO's claim that the air campaign is
having success against Milosevic's heavy forces in Kosovo. It also
set a benchmark to follow as the debate over ground forces
intensifies. Military theory holds that combat units lose their
ability to fight after suffering losses of 50 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, if you lose a third of your capability,
how effective are you?'' said one senior NATO official. ``From a
military perspective, as you watch the cumulative damage to their
forces, they obviously have to be losing effectiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   At what point that level is low enough for NATO forces to enter
Kosovo is a question diplomats and commanders here will likely
struggle with over the next few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats say NATO commanders could declare Kosovo a
``permissive environment,'' in military terms, if the allied
bombing pounded Yugoslav forces to the point where they threatened
only scattered resistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sensitive issue,'' a senior diplomat said. ``But we
can't be here come winter. We don't want that.''

BEHIND THE SECRET INQUIRY INTO CHINA'S ESPIONAGE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JEFF GERTH and TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Inside Room H407, a tightly guarded chamber of the
Capitol, Rep. Christopher Cox, a R-Calif., listened last October as
Donald Rumsfeld, a former secretary of defense, talked about
China's missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Cox asked a crucial question: How had the Chinese managed to
modernize their nuclear weapons program? The special House
committee he led was investigating China's access to American
technology. It needed an answer.
</P>
<P>
   The answer was a secret, replied Rumsfeld, author of a highly
classified report on missile threats commissioned by Congress. The
committee could not be told. But Cox would not be denied. He went
to the CIA, asking for inside information on China's espionage. And
he got it.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, his committee will report that China has
systematically stolen design information on U.S. nuclear warheads
and missiles from the nation's weapons laboratories since the
1970s, said officials familiar with its conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was what Chris Cox stumbled onto as he started peeling
the onion layers back,'' said William Schneider Jr., a Rumsfeld
commission member, who witnessed the meeting in H407. ``The
chairman had his eyes opened.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., a Cox committee member, said the secret
files ``opened not only Chris' eyes, but all our eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Cox committee found over the next few months was that
relentless espionage, assiduous research and open exchanges with
American scientists had saved China incalculable time and money in
its drive to build a modern nuclear arsenal, said officials who
have been told the contents of the committee's report.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also learned of thefts of nuclear weapons
information in the mid-1990s _ yet another espionage case still
under investigation, whose details the report cannot publicly
disclose. The committee believes that Chinese spying continues at
the nation's weapons laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   And it concluded that China will field a new generation of
nuclear weapons in coming years, based at least in part on stolen
information, that could alter the balance of power in Asia,
especially regarding Taiwan, which China views as a breakaway
province.
</P>
<P>
   But the committee's members do not necessarily believe that the
United States is directly threatened by China's nuclear advances.
The U.S. nuclear arsenal overwhelmingly outmatches China's. And
while its espionage may have propelled a great leap toward modern
nuclear forces, China has not yet deployed a weapon based on the
stolen data.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it make them less dangerous? More dangerous? I don't
know,'' said Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., chairman of the House
Intelligence Committee and Cox committee member.
</P>
<P>
   Cox said the report ``ought not to chill relations'' between
Beijing and Washington, ``for the simple reason that the underlying
facts were known to both governments beforehand.'' But he said ``it
should provide the basis for a reassessment of U.S. policy'' toward
China.
</P>
<P>
   The report will give the nation the deepest look ever into a
realm of cloaks and daggers that lives on long after the Cold War.
It already has ignited a debate on the balance between science and
security at the national laboratories, not to mention spawning 10
more congressional investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Its publication, after a five-month struggle over its
declassification, will cap an unusual effort to pierce the shield
of secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   The Cox committee was created in late May 1998 by Newt Gingrich,
then the speaker of the House, who saw it as a political tool to
attack Clinton's commercial diplomacy with China, which he called
``a threat to the survival of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Given those beginnings, ``Democrats were suspicious because the
Republicans had made it clear there were going to be impeachable
offenses here,'' said Rep. Norm Dicks of Washington, the
committee's ranking Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   But the committee held together. It stayed away from explosive
but unproven charges that Chinese military and intelligence
officials tried to sway the 1996 elections for the Democrats by
buying access to politicians.
</P>
<P>
   While Congress fought furiously over impeachment, the four
Republicans and four Democrats under Cox achieved quiet consensus
and delivered a unanimous report.
</P>
<P>
   The committee began work in July with a seemingly narrow focus:
how American commercial satellite technology leaked to China under
export licenses approved by President Clinton and President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider, a State Department official in the Reagan
administration, said: ``Cox was seen by the Democrats as a fair guy
who was undertaking a narrow investigation into satellite launches.
The committee had a fixed life of six months, and Congress would be
out of session over much of that time, so they would not be around
to do the heavy lifting of reading documents.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee's staff included some who had served on the
Rumsfeld commission, which had uncovered at least one crucial file
pointing to Chinese nuclear espionage. They went to work in a
windowless bunker with 36 cubicles, ``burn bags'' for classified
litter and alarm systems to ward off visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy lifting began in October, after Cox gained access to
the secret intelligence files. Goss, chairman of the House
Intelligence Committee, said he told the CIA, where he once worked,
that ``Cox was an honorable man.'' He helped win the necessary
security clearances for the committee and its chairman.
</P>
<P>
   The access transformed the committee's investigation. From
security problems involving commercial satellites, the committee
was soon examining far more disturbing breaches involving nuclear
weapons designs stolen from government laboratories. ``The
committee started out going through a door, and we came into a
room, and there was more in that room than we thought there would
be,'' Goss said. ``We could have gone on for another six months.''
</P>
<P>
   The director of Central Intelligence, George J. Tenet, ``was
willing to give us access and to open the doors of the CIA,'' said
Weldon. ``That was a sea change, when George offered that
openness.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee was less successful on another front. Cox
repeatedly asked the Justice Department for information from
federal grand jury investigations of American companies' exports of
satellites, computers and machine tools to China. He was rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But in late October, days before the 1998 elections, the
committee made its most important discovery.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1995, scientists at the Los Alamos nuclear laboratory
told Notra Trulock, then intelligence director at the Energy
Department, which oversees the national labs, of their fears that
China had achieved a remarkable breakthrough in its nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time that those fears were raised, the
intelligence files showed, a Chinese agent had handed over a secret
document to American officials. The document contained evidence
that China had stolen design data on American nuclear warheads and
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the CIA decided that the agent had been planted by the
Chinese intelligence service, to send a message whose meaning is
debated to this day. But the agency determined that the document he
had delivered contained at least a measure of truth _ that American
secrets had been stolen.
</P>
<P>
   This should have set off alarm bells at the national weapons
laboratories. But the alarms were broken, said Trulock, who became
the Cox committee's star witness in the fall of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He secretly testified that he had tried to raise warnings about
espionage at the labs, but had been thwarted by his superiors at
the Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
   In late October, at a White House meeting, Bill Richardson, the
new energy secretary, pulled aside Sandy Berger, the national
security adviser, said a senior administration official. Richardson
said, in so many words: We're starting to get requests for
information from the Cox committee, and this China stuff is a
problem, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House knew what the committee wanted to know. Clinton
had been told about the problems at the weapons laboratories, but
no earlier than July 1997 and possibly as late as February 1998,
according to the varied recollections of Berger.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats said they feared the information about the Chinese
espionage would leak and damage them politically on the eve of the
November 1998 elections.
</P>
<P>
   It did not. ``We had a sworn pact among the nine of us that we
would not divulge information, and for the first time in my career
in Congress, that worked,'' Weldon said.
</P>
<P>
   After the elections, as the storm of impeachment hearings
gathered over the Capitol, the committee's deadline loomed. The
committee would cease to exist when the newly elected Congress
convened in January. It wanted to complete its research by Dec. 1
and finish its report by Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   It considered subpoenaing Richardson and the Energy Department
for crucial documents, including some that sat on Richardson's desk
for a week before he read them, a senior administration official
said. Dicks prodded Richardson to produce the information. He
finally did, briefing the committee on Dec. 7.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 12 days, the nine members of the committee tried to
finish their report, which was approaching the length of a Russian
novel, while weighing the impeachment of the president. On the
16th, they took their last testimony from Trulock, a self-described
whistle-blower who, more than anyone, saw the security breaches at
the weapons laboratories as the gravest of threats. On the 19th,
the House impeached the president.
</P>
<P>
   The Cox committee report was completed on Dec. 30, after less
than six months of intense work. It would take nearly five months
more to declassify it.
</P>
<P>
   Without consulting the committee, the White House summarily
declassified the panel's 32 recommendations, including tightening
security at the labs, toughening export controls and sharing
intelligence information between government agencies. The White
House released the Cox recommendations, along with its own
responses, to selected reporters on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were hoping to spin the report,'' Weldon said.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later Cox and Dicks asked to meet with Clinton to
discuss their findings. The White House did not respond for weeks.
For more than a month, Clinton did not have much to say in public
about the report's findings; some had already appeared in The New
York Times, The Wall Street Journal and other publications.
</P>
<P>
   On March 19, at a press conference, Clinton assured the public
that ``there has been no espionage at the labs since I have been
president'' and ``no one has reported to me that they suspect such
a thing has occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout March and April, the White House and the committee
fought over how to declassify the report. Nearly a third of its
findings will remain secret at the behest of American intelligence
and law-enforcement agencies, Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   As the fight dragged on, the CIA, at the committee's
recommendation, pulled together an analysis of the impact of the
spying, reflecting the consensus of American intelligence
officials.
</P>
<P>
   On April 21, the CIA published its findings. It did not
highlight espionage as a critical element of China's effort to
improve its nuclear capabilities. It could not determine the
relative importance of espionage, openly available information and
home-grown Chinese know-how.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line,'' said a senior intelligence official, ``is
we don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did they know ``whether any weapon design documentation
or blueprints were stolen.'' The Cox committee said China may have
obtained such documents, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the CIA report agreed with the Cox committee's
central conclusion: Stolen American nuclear secrets had accelerated
the Chinese drive toward a modern arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   On April 22, the day after the CIA report was published, Cox and
Dicks got their meeting with the president and discussed the
findings of their report.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, Clinton has not repeated his earlier statements that
he was unaware of suspicions of Chinese espionage on his watch.

   KUKES, Albania _ They left behind almost everything they loved
and now, day after long, empty day, the refugees from Kosovo's
second-largest city ache with the memories of home.
</P>
<P>
   They grasp for hope of returning, remembering the place they
were forced to flee so suddenly. As their despair grows, they can
only search the tractors and dusty wagons of new refugees for
familiar faces or news of their home, the Bajram Curri neighborhood
of Prizren, the lovely old Turkish town nestled against the wall of
soaring mountains that separates Kosovo from Albania.
</P>
<P>
   More than 300,000 refugees have trudged through Kukes on their
way to more secure shelter farther from the border with Yugoslavia,
just 10 miles away. But about 100,000 remain here, and among them
are a large number from Prizren, who have stubbornly refused to be
uprooted again.
</P>
<P>
   Here, they stroll arm in arm along the dust-choked main street
or in the refugee camps, in a sad imitation of the gracious walks
they used to take along the cobblestoned streets of their beloved
Prizren, a cultured hillside city of ancient mosques and
well-cared-for churches that is one of Kosovo's oldest and largest
cities.
</P>
<P>
   They abandoned their quiet Prizren neighborhood at different
times, and for different reasons. Some left with the angry shouts
of Serbian police officers ringing in their ears. Some fled after a
brother, or a son, was grabbed out of bed and taken away. Some went
not because they were ordered to, but because it was clear that if
they remained, they too would become victims of Serbian aggression.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly everyone from the neighborhood left. With each day,
they wonder when, and if, they can go home. In the meantime, they
work to reassemble parts of the life they led in Bajram Curri, on
the city's outskirts.
</P>
<P>
   While it in no way relieves the horror of what they have been
through, they have found, in the common act of their survival, some
degree of satisfaction and even a measure of triumph over the
forces that intended to tear them apart.
</P>
<P>
   Bajram Curri was the kind of place people moved to when they
were confident about the future. There it was possible to take
hard-earned savings and build a fine, strong house, with enough
land to grow leeks and onions and have room for children and dogs
to run.
</P>
<P>
   Ismet Hoti loved Bajram Curri, which was named after an Albanian
nationalist hero. Several years ago Serbian authorities changed the
name to 27th of March, to commemorate the day in 1989 when Slobodan
Milosevic stripped Kosovo of the broad autonomy it had enjoyed
since 1974. But to ethnic Albanians who lived there, it remained
Bajram Curri.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately after the NATO bombing campaign began March
24, Hoti said, Serbian forces moved tanks and antiaircraft guns
into the big Farmakos pharmaceutical factory about 500 feet away
from his house.
</P>
<P>
   The following morning, Hoti _ a music teacher who plays the
clarinet _ took his wife and three children in his red Yugo car to
the house of a relative in the center of Prizren, where he thought
they would be safer. But it was just as bad, and after the police
showed up and warned him not to get comfortable, Hoti left Kosovo
on April 30.
</P>
<P>
   He and his family now live with an Albanian family, squeezed
into a two-room apartment. He arrived without his passport, his
identification papers and his clarinet.
</P>
<P>
   Now he can often be found wandering the main street of Kukes,
holding the arm of his son Lulezim, 20, and looking for family and
friends from Bajram Curri. He wonders what will be left of his
home, his school and the cultured life he built for his family in
Prizren.
</P>
<P>
   ``But at least,'' he says, shrugging, ``I am alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoti occasionally runs into Masar Shala, who is renting the
apartment of an Albanian family for about $420 a month _ a small
fortune in poor, rugged northern Albania. Of all the people in
Bajram Curri, Shala, 35, may have had the most to fear from the
police. For nine years he headed the Council in Defense of Human
Rights in Prizren, investigating dozens of acts of violence in the
region. In just the previous 10 months, he had recorded 178
killings and the burning of 518 houses.
</P>
<P>
   Shala's work angered Serbian authorities. They arrested him
twice, and four times the police searched the house where he lived
with his parents, two brothers and their families.
</P>
<P>
   In the rush following the Shalas' decision to leave on March 28,
Shala's father, who is blind, left behind the dominoes he enjoyed
playing. He now often sits in the apartment all day doing nothing
but smoking hand-rolled cigarettes. Shala could not take his
younger son's tiny bicycle, and now the boy, Butrint, cries for it
every day.
</P>
<P>
   The family did bring a few photos, and when they flip through
the scenes of happier days _ one showing Butrint atop a big red
tractor, the kind of image that has come to convey the Kosovo
Albanians' exile _ they all fall silent.
</P>
<P>
   Because of his work with the human rights group, Shala was the
person to whom many neighbors looked for guidance. More than a
dozen families left when he did. Shala's uncle, Mustafe Hoti, took
nothing, thinking he would only be gone a few days. In Kukes he
wears the same jacket every day.
</P>
<P>
   One neighbor, Amrush Zogaj, a retired textile worker, said he
was so upset at fleeing that he forgot to change his old shoes for
the new ones he had put next to his door. The broken-down shoes now
sit at the entrance to the tent at the Irish camp in Kukes where
Zogaj lives.
</P>
<P>
   There he eats canned meat and bean soup whose only saving grace,
he says, is that they are always in short supply. But his wife
still prepares for him the sweet Turkish coffee he had in Bajram
Curri, and, after eating, when he lights a cigarette and sips his
coffee, he sometimes thinks about the antique two-string lyre he
used to play when he sang at weddings.
</P>
<P>
   He will not sing now, not without the lyre. But he says he can
hear the music in his head. ``Let NATO hit the Serbs hard,'' he
says, ``again and again.'' He counts the days until he can return
to Prizren.
</P>
<P>
   As for Hajrush Xhema, on his right forearm he has a tattoo with
the letters JNA, which stood for the Yugoslav army that was the
precursor to the forces now clearing Kosovo. He was proud to have
served in that army, he said, and to have lived in Belgrade during
the time that Tito, the Communist strongman, held Yugoslavia
together.
</P>
<P>
   But after Milosevic took power in Serbia in 1987, Xhema returned
to Kosovo. He bought land adjacent to Shala's and built a large
house of concrete blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Xhema, 39, worked in the Bajram Curri market selling fruit and
vegetables. After Serbian troops shot up the market on March 28, he
and his family took a bus to the village of Plava, where he was
born, feeling it might be safer there because many of the people,
though Muslim, spoke Serbian, as he does.
</P>
<P>
   But two days after he arrived in Plava, paramilitary forces
began shelling a nearby village. On April 1, he loaded a tractor
with blankets and headed for Albania. He abandoned almost
everything he owned, but he only regrets having left behind a
framed photograph of himself as a teen-age wrestler.
</P>
<P>
   ``The washing machine and the television I can buy again,''
Xhema said. ``If the house is burned, I can build it again. But the
photograph I can't replace. Many times I've thought of going back
to Kosovo just to get this picture.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   He often prowls the streets of Kukes now, distraught that he has
lost his home and ashamed that he, a man who has worked hard since
boyhood, now has no work. He often walks with another neighbor, a
former professor, and they tell each other tales of life in Kosovo.
But they never forget they are in Kukes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is nothing like Prizren,'' Xhema said one morning. ``I'm
hoping every day that we can go back. Even if it means living in a
tent because the house is destroyed, we want to be able to go
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Agim Krasniqi, 29, also lived near the pharmaceutical plant in
Bajram Curri. On March 27 _ the same day commemorated in the
neighborhood's hated Serbian name _ Krasniqi packed one bag of
extra clothing and, with his wife, walked away from his house. He
went to stay with an uncle in the center of Prizren. There he lived
as though in prison, eating watery soup, hiding in the attic,
sleeping in his clothes, going out only for a half-hour a day.
</P>
<P>
   The fear of being taken off by the army was always present. One
day it was Krasniqi's cousin, Fadil, who was grabbed, at 7 in the
morning, in his pajamas. He has not been seen since.
</P>
<P>
   On May 1, Krasniqi and his wife boarded a bus for Albania. For
now they are staying in a large beige tent in a refugee camp here
run by the government of the United Arab Emirates, which provides
plenty of food but expects the children to attend classes in the
mosque every day.
</P>
<P>
   The tent is too hot, and the smell of overtaxed outhouses nearby
too offensive. But he is happy here because he lives with his uncle
and his uncle's family, and occasionally goes to visit his brother,
who has a tent down the dusty road at the Irish camp.
</P>
<P>
   Some days Krasniqi walks several rows over to the tent of a past
and present neighbor, Ali Krasniqi (no relation), a jovial
29-year-old who was a pizza maker in Prizren. He remained in an
increasingly desperate Bajram Curri longer than almost anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were tanks in between all the houses and police living
inside many of the places where people had already left,'' Ali
Krasniqi said. ``I passed by Masar Shala's house one day and saw
soldiers digging defensive trenches in the front yard.''
</P>
<P>
   When he left Bajram Curri on April 30, only a handful of old
people _ including his own mother and father, who refused to leave
_ still lived in the 300 houses there.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest of the houses were empty,'' he said. ``All that was
left was dogs, cows, and Serbs.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Arab camp, he regularly runs into people from Bajram
Curri who pine for the past. He left behind everything, but when
Krasniqi or any other neighbor from Prizren comes to his tent, he
insists on showing Prizren hospitality.
</P>
<P>
   They sit on thin cushions on the floor, the way they would have
in Bajram Curri. They have Turkish coffee with enough sugar to make
the spoon stand straight up. They toss each other cigarettes and
hold a lighter for each other. Then, for a while more, they
remember.

   KOSOVO-KLA _ KOSARE, Kosovo _ The hard-faced soldiers lining the
perimeter of this guerrilla army base stood at the ready, fingers
on the triggers of their AK-47 assault rifles, prepared to mow down
an attacking Serb force. But the immediate purpose of the Kovoso
Liberation Army troops was to serve as targets for us, a dozen
visiting foreign correspondents and cameramen, the first group of
its kind escorted by the KLA from Albania into the southern
highlands of Kosovo. The KLA wanted us to see their base at Kosare,
and talk to their soldiers, to demonstrate their existence in the
face of claims from Belgrade that the armed resistance movement has
been eliminated, along with the 800,000 refugees who have fled
Kosovo.The evidence was plain to see: The rebels exist.They also
bleed. The sudden artillery duel with Serb forces that left three
KLA soldiers seriously wounded wasn't necessarily what the KLA
wanted us to see. But it was all too genuine. The KLA has
discovered, as has NATO, that conquering Serb forces is not an easy
task. (Holmes, Cox News Service). WITH PHOTOS.

pain - which many adults may underestimate. The demise of a love
affair is particularly hard on teenagers, whose raging hormones can
make a breakup a prescription for depression or destruction. Such a
loss seems to have played a role in several recent school
shootings, including Heritage High. In fact, federal teen violence
stats say such rampages are preceded by a breakup more than 50
percent of the time. We talk to specialists and teens about the
intensity of such relationships and how to help kids cope. (Lore,

although Havana Cola's can is red _ like Coca-Cola's _ its shade is
a candy-apple one. ``It has a different taste, and I think a better
one,'' boasts Vaughan, a 48-year-old mother of four. ``I believe
once people try it they'll pull a switcheroo.'' If sheer exuberance
were an asset, Vaughan _ who's never run a business before _ would
already be a millionaire. But exuberance alone may not be enough.

   UNEXPLORED _ MIAMI _ The explorers battled fat leeches and

river. They even heard rumors of the Dugmas, a cult of females who
attack outsiders with snake venom concealed beneath their
fingernails. It sounds like an Indiana Jones-style adventure, but
it was real. The expedition, sponsored by the National Geographic
Society last November, took four Americans into the inner gorge of
the Tsangpo River, the world's deepest canyon, in a remote part of
Tibet. The 17-day undertaking was a lesson in endurance, but the
reward was extraordinary: the sight of a thundering, 100-foot-high
cascade, dubbed ``Hidden Falls.'' But what's equally extraordinary
is that a giant waterfall on a major river had yet to be recorded.

COMMENTARY: WHAT MAKES THE POLS RUN? 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the Rolling Stones famously warbled, you can't
always get what you want. So New York's top politicians are doing
the next best thing _ scrambling to take what they can get.
</P>
<P>
   Start with Rudolph Giuliani, the mayor with the totalitarian
inclinations. He'd like to be president but that's not happening.
His next choice probably would be governor but fellow Republican
George Pataki holds a lease on that office through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's third choice might be to stay on as mayor (he likes
to run things and torment people) but mischief-makers imposed term
limits a few years ago. So he's apparently piecing together a
campaign for a seat in the U.S. Senate, a job for which he is
wildly unsuited and which he is almost guaranteed to hate.
</P>
<P>
   (Imagine Rudolph Giuliani, just one of 100 senators, listening
to the likes of Phil Gramm or John D. Rockefeller IV, both with
greater seniority, droning on about agricultural production or some
problem related to the inland waterways. You could start a
countdown to the meltdown.)
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Pataki is pretty restless himself. He, too, would
like to be president but that's not happening. As he traveled the
country _ Illinois, Missouri, New Hampshire _ trying to gauge his
chances of capturing the Republican nomination, the question most
people asked was, ``Who's that?''
</P>
<P>
   He'd settle, of course, for the second spot on a national ticket
but that's looking unlikely as well. What to do? The governor plans
a big announcement Monday. The word is that he is going to endorse
George W. Bush, which is pretty anticlimactic given the big,
mysterious buildup orchestrated by the governor's office last week.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever happens, a safe bet is that Pataki and his good
buddy, former Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, will do all in their
considerable power to keep Giuliani from going to the Senate. When
Pataki, a D'Amato protege, first ran for governor, Giuliani was not
satisfied to simply endorse his Democratic opponent, Mario Cuomo.
The mayor went on to rub salt in the wound he inflicted on Pataki
by publicly declaring that ``if the D'Amato-Pataki crew ever get
control, ethics will be trashed.''
</P>
<P>
   Politicians know better than anyone that revenge is a dish best
served cold. D'Amato wept when he lost his seat in the Senate,
which he loved. Watching Giuliani set up shop on the Senate floor
won't make him feel any better. The D'Amato-Pataki crew is now,
five years later, doing its best to trash any advance by the
ambitious mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The man who wanted to go to the Senate as much as anyone was
Mark Green, now the city's public advocate. Green is
temperamentally well suited to be a senator and would give almost
anything for a crack at the seat being vacated by Daniel Patrick
Moynihan. But that's not happening. Green has fully absorbed the
lesson of the Rolling Stones, having already run twice for the
Senate and lost. So he plans to run for mayor in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The political scene in New York is starting to resemble a dinner
party at which the place cards have been shuffled and some
invitations withdrawn. The weirdest situation involves Rep. Nita
Lowey, a Westchester County Democrat who really, really wants to
run for Moynihan's seat. She's all set. Ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a small problem called Hillary Rodham Clinton. Mrs.
Clinton, whose last known addresses were in Illinois, Arkansas and
Washington, is thinking about running for the Senate from New York.
As a potential candidate, she is a tsunami to Nita Lowey's ripple.
Therefore, if Mrs. Clinton were to run, and it looks more and more
as if that will happen, Ms. Lowey would surrender her Senate
fantasies and run for another term in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The really weird part? Mrs. Clinton will be the big draw at a
gala fund-raiser for Ms. Lowey at the Grand Hyatt Hotel in
Manhattan on Monday night. Awards will be handed out for the most
convincing smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Mrs. Clinton knows something. By all accounts she hadn't
taken a Senate run seriously until a few months ago. The whole
thing started as a lark, wishful thinking on the part of a few New
York Democrats. Maybe that's the key to coming out on top. Not
wanting it too badly.

   WASHINGTON _ For many years, the favorite rite of spring in
Washington was awaiting the mating of the pandas at the National
Zoo.
</P>
<P>
   The late Henry Mitchell of The Washington Post put it best:
</P>
<P>
   ``Spring is here. The sap is ris.
</P>
<P>
   I wonder how the pandas is?''
</P>
<P>
   There is only one panda left, so this spring the capital is
fascinated with the conjugal arrangements of a higher order.
</P>
<P>
   The town is abuzz with rumors that Elizabeth, who admitted that
her husband was in ``the family woodshed,'' locked Bob out of their
apartment after he gave The New York Times an interview belittling
her presidential chances.
</P>
<P>
   The town is febrile with speculation about whether Hillary, who
never lets her husband out of the woodshed, might drag Bill on
holiday to the Adirondacks _ to help her Senate chances, but also
to aggravate his allergy to trees.
</P>
<P>
   The sap is ris and so is tempers. Suddenly, everyone is mad at
everyone else. You really need a diagram, with arrows pointing, to
keep track of all the spats and snits.
</P>
<P>
   The Doles, who have spent decades promoting themselves as close
partners, are, for the moment, beyond the inspiration of Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   Sugar Lips is mad at Bob for his loose lips. As Dick Armey puts
it, ``He is going to be singing `Strangers in the Night' for a long
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Liddy's strategists are mad at Bob for knocking the campaign off
track just as it was getting on track and launching a big
fund-raising drive.
</P>
<P>
   Bob is mad at Liddy for being the center of attention. (Now
Liddy, who hates to be called Liddy, will be mad at me.)
</P>
<P>
   Bob's campaign aides from his '96 presidential run are mad that
people didn't realize sooner how hard they had it with Grumpy.
</P>
<P>
   John McCain is mad because now Bob will have to stop supporting
him and start supporting his own wife.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons and Gores, whose '92 campaign was like a yuppie
double date on a cross-country bus, are not so cozy now. That New
Age communitarian spirit has been replaced with old-fashioned
crankiness.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary is mad at Bill. Duh.
</P>
<P>
   Al is mad at Hillary and Bill. Al is ticked that Hillary is
steaming toward the Senate race. Not only would her star turn
overshadow his plodding quest for the White House, diverting
attention and donations. It also would inevitably dredge up those
Clinton skeletons. Al must have gotten even madder at word last
week from Hillary pals that the Senate run is merely a prelude to a
White House run in 2004 _ a feminist dream predicated on the
assumption that Al won't make it.
</P>
<P>
   Al is mad at Bill for not warning him before he called The
Times' Richard Berke to chew over Al's limitations.
</P>
<P>
   Bill is mad at Al back, because he feels Vice President Lame-o
should be grateful that he also told The Times so many nice things
that it was practically a paid ad. Bill feels he should be able to
speak his mind sometimes without filters.
</P>
<P>
   Bill is also mad at Al because there is one word Al never utters
on the campaign trail: Bill.
</P>
<P>
   (Bill is not mad at himself, of course. He never is.)
</P>
<P>
   Top Gore strategists are mad at Bill and at each other. Tony
Coelho, the new campaign chairman, is mad at Ron Klain, Gore's
chief of staff, for going along with Bill's call. Ron is mad at
Tony for publicly blaming him for going along with the call. Craig
Smith, the unwitting campaign manager, is mad at both those guys.
</P>
<P>
   Tipper is mad at Bill for continuing to make messes just as Al
is trying to shake off Bill's dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Hillary is mad at Tipper for abruptly distancing herself, saying
she'd be a very different kind of first lady.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are mad at Trent for bungling the Senate guns fight
and letting Al become the hero of gun control with a tie-breaking
vote just hours after another school shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Bill is mad at Hillary and Al for being able to run in 2000, as
he contemplates his phantom legacy and the dread thought that he'd
have to give the Oval Office over to George Bush after getting it
from George Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bill is mad at Hillary for planning a future in which she is the
center of attention.
</P>
<P>
   Bill is mad at Tony and Gerhard is mad at Tony _ oh, let's not
get into global bickering or we'll never get out of here. (BOX)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ When he gave his opening address to the 76th session
of the Texas Legislature in January, Gov. George W. Bush, widely
touted as the Republican front-runner for president in 2000, told
the legislators that as a result, like it or not, the eyes of the
nation were on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can either view it as a distraction or seize it as an
opportunity to show the world what limited and constructive
government looks like,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, four months later, the legislative session is entering its
final full week with some of Bush's initiatives _ a crackdown on
social promotions in elementary schools, mandated parental
notification for almost all abortions by teen-agers _ not finalized
but expected to pass. At least one, a pilot program for school
vouchers, is apparently dead for this session.
</P>
<P>
   The two centerpieces of his legislative agenda, a major tax cut
and additional spending on education, are only now moving to the
center of the debate after a last-minute infusion of cash from
higher-than-expected state budget surplus estimates seems to have
brought both goals within reach.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how much will go to tax cuts and how much to education
will be hammered out in the session's final days, as will all the
ancillary issues still hanging in the wind. On the strength of that
result will ride the legacy that Bush carries into next year's
presidential race, as well as the clearest indication that voters
nationwide may have of his policy priorities and his vision of
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tax cut is the centerpiece, the most important thing to
his presidential race,'' said Bruce Buchanan, a government
professor at the University of Texas who is an authority on
presidential politics. ``And it looks like he'll get it.''
</P>
<P>
   What is less clear is whether Bush's bipartisan image or his
stature as a leader will have been enhanced by an agenda that
opponents call timid and by a session that was, in the words of
Richard Murray, a government professor at the University of
Houston, ``one of the very boring sessions in modern Texas
history.''
</P>
<P>
   In Murray's view, the governor ``avoided major damage, but did
not enhance his image as a leader that has a sense of where he
wants to take the state or the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan attributed this in part to a lack of boldness in the
agenda put forward by Bush, who preferred to go for a small number
of achievable goals rather than risking political capital on
grander gambles.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not one to take impassioned stands on controversial
issues,'' Buchanan said. ``And he's very sensitive to the situation
that he's in, as the front-runner, so he's playing defense a little
more. He sets things up in such a way that he can't fail, pushing
for items for which a sizable constituency already exists.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's staff members shrug off criticism and insist that
when the final gavel falls on May 31, the session will be seen as a
success for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside of, perhaps, a pilot program for school vouchers, the
governor looks like he is going to achieve just about everything he
wanted this session,'' said Karen Hughes, Bush's communications
director.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan maintained that if anything could be gleaned about
governor Bush's theory of government by studying this session, it
is that ``he has an almost Whiggish attitude regarding the
Legislature, by which I mean that he puts his ideas forward and
then lets the Legislature hash them out, almost a policy of
legislative deference.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   In his state-of-the-state address in January, Bush told the
legislators how he wanted to divide up the state's budget surplus,
then estimated to be $5.6 billion. Some $2 billion of it, he said,
should go for property tax relief, with $600 million split among
small-business tax cuts, incentives for research and development
and targeted sales tax relief.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as two weeks ago, there was doubt about whether the
governor would get his tax-cutting wishes. Fighting over how much
of the surplus to spend on education and how much to spend on tax
relief failed to produce a bill in either the Republican-controlled
Senate or the Democratic-controlled House that came close to the $2
billion in property tax cuts that Bush had outlined in January.
</P>
<P>
   But then, about a week ago, the state comptroller, Carole Keeton
Rylander, said that price increases in oil and gas, as well as
other factors, had flushed out $800 million more in surplus money _
enough to provide the tax relief that Bush wants and the
across-the-board teachers raises that the Democrats want. All over
Austin, champagne was put on ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the governor will get fairly close to what he asked
for,'' said Rep. Paul Sadler, a Democrat who shepherded the House
education bill, which called for a $3,000 pay increase for the
state's public school teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the $2 billion property tax cut that Bush seeks,
Sadler said: ``There's not anything magic about the number `2.'
Even if he comes out with $1.5 billion in cuts, he'll still be able
to say it's the biggest tax cut in Texas history.''
</P>
<P>
   After the comptroller had made public the new surplus estimate,
even the governor said it opened the way to ``meaningful tax
cuts,'' and did not mention the $2 billion figure.
</P>
<P>
   The state's teachers are happy that the comptroller's new budget
estimate appears to make possible the across-the-board raise rather
than one that was proposed in the state Senate, which would have
guaranteed $4,000 raises only to those teachers who earn the
minimum salary and left any other pay increases largely to the
discretion of school districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would agree that it looks promising, but we are still very
vigilant,'' said Jay Levin, director of government relations for
the Texas State Teachers Association. ``We won't know until a few
minutes before the final gavel goes down as the legislators make up
their mind how they are going to distribute that money, whether
it's going to be into education or tax cuts or a combination of
both.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor had said when announcing the formation of his
presidential exploratory committee in February that he would do no
campaigning or traveling until the legislative session ended.
Democratic officials said that regardless, he was noticeably more
distant this session than in past ones.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, said Ms. Hughes, the Bush communications director, at
least where it counts. The governor may not have had as many
late-night meetings with legislators as he had in his previous two
sessions, she said, but he was available when needed.
</P>
<P>
   At least a couple of Democratic legislators agreed with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has not once failed to be there when I needed him,'' Sadler
said. ``He has either gotten right on the phone or responded within
a number of minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Sen. Rodney Ellis, the Houston Democrat whose hate-crimes
bill became the focus of partisan bickering and who accused
Republicans of killing it so that Bush would not be forced to take
a public position on it, said the governor had been more than
accessible during the session.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always got a meeting or a call back from him, every time,''
Ellis said. ``Look, I'm as proud of a Republican governor from this
state being a national figure as I was when Democratic governors
became national figures in the past.''

BLAIR'S COUNTERCULTURAL PLAN FOR WELFARE IN BRITAIN: GET WORK
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ There were dozens of job opportunities listed at the
shiny new Palmers Green job center in the far north of the city,
but they were not of immediate concern to James Baxter, who has
been unemployed for several months and gets about 50 pounds a week,
or $80, in dole money.
</P>
<P>
   What was he doing there, then? ``I'm waiting to go see that
lady, sign a piece of paper and disappear,'' explained Baxter, 23.
``The primary reason I'm here is because they pay out benefits.
That's the main reason anyone comes to a job center.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so, but it is an attitude that Prime Minister Tony Blair
says he is determined to change. Through a two-pronged program that
aims both to put the unemployed back to work and to rein in the
country's $158.9 billion dollar-a-year welfare bill, Blair has
pledged nothing less than an end to what he calls the
``something-for-nothing welfare state.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The days of an automatic right to benefit will go,'' Blair
said in February. ``If you can work, you should work.''
</P>
<P>
   It sounds reasonable, but it is a tall order. Aspects of the
welfare reform program have infuriated legislators on Labor's left
wing and interest groups representing the sick and disabled, who
say that some of the proposed cuts will take benefits away from
some of the neediest people.
</P>
<P>
   The welfare culture is so entrenched in Britain that some 30
million of its 59 million residents currently receive some kind of
state assistance, in the form of pensions, housing benefits,
disability benefits, unemployment benefits, child benefits and the
like. And to most people, such support is seen as a right, not a
privilege.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always been quite a profound difference in philosophy
between here and America when it comes to welfare,'' said Maeve
Sherlock, director of the National Council of One-Parent Families,
an interest group.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here, if my husband walked out and I lost my job,'' she added,
``I wouldn't for one minute feel guilty about claiming benefits.
The danger of Tony Blair's rhetoric is that he seems to be saying
there is something intrinsically wrong with your going out and
getting your benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many critics of the government's program argue
that it reflects what they say is Blair's Achilles' Heel: the
desire to be all things to all people, to appeal to the
conservative-leaning middle class that helped propel him into
office in 1997 while not abandoning the poor and working classes,
Labor's traditional base. The tough talk, they say, is one thing;
the reality may fall short of the promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony Blair is like someone who has inherited a bar from an
elderly widow who's spent nothing on it for years, and he's trying
to tell his mum that everything's going to be the same _ nothing's
going to change _ and at the same time he's trying to tell his
friends that everything's going to change,'' said Martin Evans, a
research fellow at the Center for Analysis of Public Exclusion at
the London School of Economics.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as the director of one poverty interest group put it, ``The
rhetoric is much worse than the action.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair's program, which freely borrows much of its stern
philosophical message from the United States, is re-examining many
segments of the welfare state. Conceived during the second World
War by economist William Beveridge as a way to provide Britons with
social security ``from the cradle to the grave,'' the system has
grown wildly, now representing about a third of the government's
total annual spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was designed to pay out stopgap insurance between periods
of unemployment,'' Alistair Darling, the British Social Security
secretary, said in a recent interview. ``It was designed to be
progressive, as a force for good and achievement. The reason we
have to reform the system is because it is no longer in tune with
modern needs and modern times.''
</P>
<P>
   To that end, the government has begun a program in which people
ages 18 to 24 who have been unemployed for at least six months face
losing their dole money unless they get a job or enter a training
program, although the jobless rate among the group is 13.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   It has also proposed legislation under which recipients of most
state benefits, including single mothers, the long-term unemployed
and the disabled, would be required to attend regular interviews
with job counselors or risk losing the payments.
</P>
<P>
   Blair has pledged to cut $1.6 billion a year from the nation's
welfare bill by eradicating waste and fraud, and to cut $1.2
billion a year from the disability benefits programs by tightening
up eligibility requirements and cutting benefits to higher-income
recipients. And he has made it clear that the old system, under
which people could sometimes receive benefits without even having
to provide proof of identification, is no longer acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed to find that many people receive benefits for
years at a time without anyone returning to see if they are still
entitled to them,'' Blair said in February.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most notorious programs in the system, at least from
the government's point of view, is the incapacity, or disability,
benefits program, which pays up to $106.80 a week to people who,
through illness or accident, are physically unable to work.
</P>
<P>
   During the Thatcher years, when whole industries collapsed, many
people who lost their jobs found that their doctors were willing to
declare them incapable of working. This enabled them to sign up for
incapacity benefits _ which pay more than unemployment benefits _
and allowed the government to claim that fewer people were actually
unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Darling said, a quarter of men over the age of 60
are claiming the incapacity benefit. ``There was an acceptance that
people would write themselves off, or be written off,'' he said.
The general unemployment rate _ 6.2 percent _ remains artificially
low because of the strict definition of unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   But even as it cracks down on some benefits programs, the
government has poured money into others by, for instance,
increasing child benefits by nearly $4.80, to $23 a week for the
eldest child (subsequent children generate $15.35 a week). It has
also increased the state pension to $106.80 a week for single
people, and $170.70 for couples, and vowed to increase the amount
it spends on disabled and incapacitated people by $1.6 billion in
the next several years.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, Labor's program has drawn fire from both the right and
the left.
</P>
<P>
   The most stringent cuts have outraged Labor politicians on the
party's left wing, as well as interest groups representing the poor
and disabled. Frank Field, who resigned as the government's
minister for Welfare Reform over policy and personality
disagreements last summer, has repeatedly accused Labor of backing
down on its promises and of abandoning the disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I had hoped was that the government had moved away from
this kind of blanket, machine-gun attack, thinking that savings can
be made by firing at all claimants in the hope of catching some of
those who should not be claiming,'' Field said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a spokesman for the Tory Party said: ``It's
all talk and no action. In very broad terms, the government came
into office saying that they would cut welfare bills. But the bills
have gone up.''
</P>
<P>
   It is far too soon, of course, to assess the full impact of the
government's program, particularly because its centerpiece, the
Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill, has yet to be enacted by
Parliament. The bill passed the House of Commons by a vote of
360-142 this week, after a raucous debate in which 67 Labor members
defied Blair by voting against the amendment to cut the incapacity
benefits program. It now goes to the House of Lords.
</P>
<P>
   The program the government points to as being the most
successful is its $4.16 billion scheme to get young people back to
work. Under the program, Labor says, 61,380 young people have found
jobs lasting longer than six months, and 58,000 others have
received training and work experience. About 515,000 youths remain
without jobs.
</P>
<P>
   It is just this program that Baxter, who has been happily
picking up his dole checks for several months, will be forced to
enter if he does not find work soon. The $80 he collects each week
is about average here. Hoping to increase the incentive to work,
this year the government enacted a minimum wage for people 18 and
over _ $4.80 an hour for 18- to 20-year-olds, and $5.75 for people
21 and over.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, however, Baxter's prospects are better than most:
He is a recent college graduate who sees his unemployment benefit
as a stopgap measure between jobs, not a long-term way of life.
</P>
<P>
   But even he wonders how useful the New Deal program will be.
``It's supposed to be a shock, so it gets you hunting for a job,''
he said. ``But we have such an entrenched benefit culture here.
People don't want to be seen loafing around and not doing work. But
it's so easy to get benefits. And people expect that those who need
help will get it from the government.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A small, but intense disturbance will migrate into southern New
England on Sunday causing showers and thunderstorms from eastern
New York to southern Maine. The most concentrated area of showers
will be near New York City, where over an inch of rain may fall. A
weak cold front extending south from low pressure in the Poconos
will trigger a few thunderstorms Sunday afternoon near the Atlantic
Seaboard as far south as Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Very cool air will arrive in the northern Plains as a strong
jet-stream disturbance induces low pressure in Wisconsin.
Thunderstorms will develop in the upper Great Lakes and some may
contain damaging winds and hail. The leading edge of cooler, drier
air will push southeastward. More thunderstorms will erupt over
Missouri, Arkansas and the lower Ohio Valley. A few of these storms
may spawn tornadoes.
</P>
<P>
   Partly sunny skies and seasonably warm weather are likely in the
wedge between the New England and Midwest disturbances. A large
area of high pressure will stretch from the plains of southern
Canada to near Vancouver. A clockwise air flow will direct dry and
rather hot air into the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   A large but weak disturbance over the Southwest will keep a deep
layer of marine air in place over southern California. Ribbons of
moist air circulating around low pressure will promote a few
afternoon thundershowers in the southern Sierra. Winds ascending
the southern Rockies will produce clouds and thunderstorms.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Warm First Third
</P>
<P>
   Despite regular surges of very cool air into the Pacific states
this spring, the first third of 1999 still ranks in seventh place
as the warmest since records began in 1895. In fact, during the
first 120 days of this year, no part of the nation averaged well
below normal readings, while nearly 40 percent of the country did
average much above seasonal readings. There have been two centers
of warmth, the upper plains and the Southeast. Recently the mild
weather in the upper plains has been tempered by record rainfall
and its attendant cloud cover. The Southeast stays generally warm
and quite dry.

FRENCH STRIKES AT MUSEUMS TIMED TO ANGER TOURISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MARLISE SIMONS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ French workers appear to be particularly skilled in
timing their strikes to cause the most irritation. Last summer,
just as France prepared to welcome tens of thousands of foreign
soccer fans here for the World Cup finals, Air France pilots went
on strike. This year, with warm weather finally announcing the
start of the tourist season, it is now the staff of
government-owned museums and historic chateaus that are out on
strike.
</P>
<P>
   Just as in the Britain of the 1970s and the Italy of the 1980s,
strikes have become a virtually permanent feature of daily life in
the France of the 1990s. Stoppages of metro and railroad workers
have become routine; strikes at a plant of the French oil giant,
Elf-Aquitaine, are in their 40th day. But if the French are getting
used to work stoppages, foreign visitors are not.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the tourists crowding Paris found the city's main
museums shut. The strike, which began on Wednesday, shut the doors
of the mighty Louvre, but also the Musee d'Orsay and the Picasso
Museum. On the Left Bank, the Cluny Museum of Medieval Art was
closed, as was The Pantheon. Outside Paris, staff members were on
strike at a number of castles, including the handsome castle of
Fontainebleau, but Versailles so far has remained open.
</P>
<P>
   Strikes at museums have happened before, but this was the first
time in recent years that so many of France's most renowned
historical treasures were inaccessible.
</P>
<P>
   The main demand of the strikers, all employees of the Culture
Ministry, is for the government to hire more people and create at
least 1,000 new jobs. They particularly want more security guards,
whose numbers, the strikers contend, have not swelled to match the
ever-growing stream of visitors. Strikers also demand that the
government end the system of hiring people on temporary contracts
and instead offer permanent jobs.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, hundreds of frustrated tourists milled around near
I.M. Pei's glass pyramid that gives access to the Louvre. Instead
of a ticket to the museum, visitors got pamphlets from striking
workers, explaining their grievances. They did not get much
sympathy. A family from Sydney, Australia, said that seeing the
Louvre's great collections from ancient Egypt and Greece would have
been the highlight of their trip to Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Caja, who had come with three friends from Madrid, Spain,
said they were all disappointed that they could not visit the
renovated halls of the Spanish masters, which had just opened last
week. ``We heard so much about the new halls,'' said Caja. ``And
now we run into a wall.''
</P>
<P>
   For many visitors to France, the Louvre clearly is a must; it
receives between 15,000 and 20,000 visitors per day. The Louvre
said it was losing close to $66,000 for every day it was closed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Across the Seine, at the Musee d'Orsay, which houses many of the
best impressionist works, strikers had put up a banner saying
``Real jobs for culture,'' a point that was lost on many visitors.
Groups of Germans and Portuguese sat on the museum steps in spring
sun, straining to understand picketing employees who explained
their cause in rapid French. The Musee d'Orsay normally gets 2.8
million visitors per year.
</P>
<P>
   The few museums that have stayed open have received an extra
crush of visitors. That includes the Orangerie in the Jardin des
Tuileries, which currently shows Nympheas, a large exhibition of
Monet's waterlily series. The Rodin Museum said it has also been
extra busy.

JORDAN'S KING MAKES MOST OF HIS VISIT TO THE STATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Call him the unorthodox royal.
</P>
<P>
   Three months after he ascended the throne, 37-year-old King
Abdullah of Jordan came to Washington for serious work and a bit of
fun.
</P>
<P>
   On the weighty side, he paid the kinds of visits expected of a
head of state: to the White House and Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   On the business side, he did something unusual for a king. He
was guest of honor at a lunch at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and
asked chief executives to please invest in his needy country.
</P>
<P>
   On the fun side, Abdullah, a bearded ``Star Trek'' buff, went to
the movies. He chose ``The Matrix,'' a cyber-age action film.
</P>
<P>
   Getting to the movie was not so amusing, however.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty shocked,'' the king said, describing his regal
transition in a talk with scholars, diplomats and journalists at
the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ``I was so used
to just jump in a taxi and go to a movie theater. I had to go in a
six-car motorcade with sirens blaring. When I got out I felt like
putting a jacket over my head, I was so embarrassed.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah became king in February after the death of his father,
Hussein, one of the best-known foreign visitors to a succession of
American presidents.
</P>
<P>
   The new king came to introduce himself, to stress what he called
the ``continuity'' of his father's foreign policy and to emphasize
Jordan's need for economic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats and Middle East experts here greeted him with
particular interest, not only out of respect for his father but
also because he represents the first in what is likely to be a new
guard of Arab leadership.
</P>
<P>
   In coming years, the aging leaders of Syria, Morocco and the
Palestinians will pass on, leaving Abdullah in the next decade or
so as probably the most experienced of a new generation of Arab
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Wherever he spoke during his weeklong stay, Abdullah stressed
that for Jordan to play a role as mediator in the Middle East and
be a confident friend to Israel as well as Arab countries, its
stagnant economy had to improve.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, he is asking Western governments _ chiefly Japan,
France and Germany _ to forgive $3.5 billion of Jordan's
obligations, half the country's crushing debt burden. The United
States forgave $700 million in Jordanian debt last year.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the king said, Jordan is reforming its largely
state-run economy. ``We're streamlining the government, privatizing
the economy,'' he told the executives at the Chamber of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence of his intentions in pushing economic reform, he
pointed to his new prime minister, Abdel Rauf Rawabdeh, whom he
introduced to the business people by his nickname, ``the
Bulldozer.''
</P>
<P>
   He promised potential investors that if they came to Jordan they
would find a reduced bureaucracy and almost instant connections.
``We're doing the best we can so that anyone coming to Jordan meets
the right people right away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the third day of the king's visit, Ehud Barak was elected
prime minister of Israel, a victory that Abdullah made no secret of
welcoming. His father made peace with Israel in 1994, but the
decision remains deeply unpopular among Jordanians. The new king
has vowed to remain ``absolutely committed'' to the peace made by
his father.
</P>
<P>
   Trained at Sandhurst, the British military academy, Abdullah
commanded Jordan's special forces until his elevation to the
throne. He said he got along well with Barak, Israel's most
decorated general.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a good working relationship with this government,'' he
said at the Strategic Studies forum. ``They are a government of
soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
   But he warned that Palestinians may be unrealistic to hope for
better ties with Israel now that Benjamin Netanyahu is no longer
prime minister. ``The fear is obviously with such a high comes high
expectations,'' he said. ``If you have an increase in aspirations
and nothing happens in four to five months down the line, there
could be a worse backlash.''

INSURERS ASK GOVERNMENT TO EXTEND HEALTH PLANS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Health insurance companies are proposing new
federal programs and tax breaks to subsidize insurance for millions
of people without coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance industry, which helped kill President Clinton's
plan to guarantee coverage for all Americans in 1994, said it had
become alarmed at the growing number of uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every American ought to be concerned that more than 43 million
people lack health insurance,'' said Leonard D. Schaeffer, chairman
of the Health Insurance Association of America, which mocked the
president's plan with its ``Harry and Louise'' commercials five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton plan would have tightly regulated the operations,
and squeezed the profits, of health insurance companies. The
association's proposals, announced on Friday and intended to cover
up to 28 million of the uninsured, would amount to a huge new
federal subsidy to the industry. But Schaeffer said most of the
money would be passed on to doctors, hospitals and others who
provide health care.
</P>
<P>
   The insurers proposed expansion of the new Children's Health
Insurance Program to cover uninsured people of all ages under the
official poverty level (an annual income of $13,880 for a family of
three). States would have a large role in arranging this coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The insurance companies also proposed a new government subsidy,
in the form of vouchers, for uninsured people between 100 percent
and 200 percent of the poverty level. The vouchers, about $2,000 a
year for each person, could be used to buy private health insurance
of the type sold by members of the association.
</P>
<P>
   The industry also said the federal government should subsidize
existing state insurance pools, for people in poor health who
cannot get insurance in the private market.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the insurers asked Congress to create new tax
deductions and tax credits to help small employers, self-employed
people and uninsured individuals buy coverage. Congress is
considering such tax breaks.
</P>
<P>
   The association said these initiatives, taken together, could
cost as much as $60 billion a year. But, it added, Congress could
start with parts of the plan costing much less.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Feder, a health policy expert who worked in the Clinton
administration from 1993 to 1995 and is now dean of policy studies
at Georgetown University, said: ``I commend the insurance industry
for supporting the expansion of public health insurance programs
for low-income people. At present, there's no medical safety net
for millions of childless adults with low incomes. But it makes me
nervous to depend on an undependable private insurance market for
people above the poverty level.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Congress and Clinton have focused on ways to
assist people who already have health insurance, by defining the
rights of patients in health maintenance organizations and by
expanding Medicare to cover prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But Charles N. Kahn III, president of the Health Insurance
Association of America, said it was more urgent to provide at least
basic coverage to people who did not have it.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress uses some of the federal budget surplus for health
care, Kahn said, it should ``spend the surplus first on basic
health coverage for all Americans before it's spent on prescription
drugs for seniors.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be easy to dismiss the association's proposals as
self-interested. But the proposals reflect the anxiety of many
business, labor and consumer groups over the erosion of health
insurance coverage in the United States. The erosion is remarkable
because it coincides with an economic boom in which the
unemployment rate is at the lowest level in 29 years.
</P>
<P>
   Health insurance executives say they fear that if the erosion of
private insurance coverage continues, people will demand new
government programs to guarantee health benefits. Such programs
could marginalize private insurance companies or force them to
operate like a heavily regulated public utility.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn said he saw no inconsistency between the industry's
positions in 1993-94 and in 1999. Back then, he said, the
association supported Clinton's goal of universal health insurance
coverage and even the means to that end favored by the president, a
mandate for all employers to subsidize coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our problem with Clinton care was the overall superstructure,
the bureaucratic and regulatory apparatus, not universal coverage
or the employer mandate,'' Kahn said.

POLITICAL NOTES: FLORIDA SENATE RACE; HAYDEN ON KOSOVO; THIRD-PARTY
MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., Calif., N.H.)   (bl)  
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Florida Democrats Feeling a Thorn  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Sen. Connie Mack of Florida announced that he would
not seek re-election this fall, the political scene in the Sunshine
State has resembled a free-for-all. No fewer than 12 people have
expressed interest in replacing Mack, a two-term Republican,
proving yet again that an open seat in politics is like honey to
the bee.
</P>
<P>
   For a brief moment last week it seemed the situation might be
clearing up a bit on the Democratic side, when Rep. Robert Wexler
withdrew as a possible contender. Coming on the heels of an earlier
pullout by Rep. Peter Deutsch, Wexler's withdrawal pretty well
guaranteed that state Insurance Commissioner Bill Nelson would
become the Democratic nominee, given the weakness of the rest of
the party's hopefuls.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden narrowing of the Democratic field greatly relieved
party leaders. They had been concerned that a crowded, divisive
Democratic primary might leave the eventual winner too broke and
beaten up to take on the winner of the Republican primary, expected
to be either state Education Commissioner Tom Gallagher or Rep.
Bill McCollum.
</P>
<P>
   But with Nelson seemingly assured a peaceful nomination, the
Democratic leaders figured to slow the Republican juggernaut that
has been rolling through Florida for the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Enter state Rep. Willie Logan of Opa-Locka. Again.
</P>
<P>
   Logan is a Democrat by registration. But in practice he is a
political free agent, going back to that time almost two years ago
when white legislators connived to keep him from becoming the first
black speaker of the Florida House.
</P>
<P>
   Logan got his revenge in the 1998 gubernatorial race, siding
with Republican candidate Jeb Bush and helping him win by urging
black voters, a significant part of the Democratic base, to either
vote Republican or stay home.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Logan had an announcement. He said he was
exploring the possibility of jumping in.
</P>
<P>
   As a Democrat, Republican or independent?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Democrat, but more importantly, I'm a Floridian,'' Logan
replied enigmatically.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, his chances of winning would be slim to nil. In
fact, running as a Democrat or a Republican, he probably would not
even get past the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Should he run as an independent, he would face no primary, yet
would still have almost no chance of winning. But in losing he
likely would siphon off a big chunk of the state's black vote, a
vote that any victorious Florida Democrat needs _ and a vote that
Logan boldly pilfered once before with notable success.
</P>
<P>
   For Tom Hayden, Almost Old Times  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He's back!
</P>
<P>
   Tom Hayden, one of the leaders of the anti-war movement in the
Vietnam era _ he organized some of the most disruptive
demonstrations and made a pilgrimage to Hanoi _ has begun writing
and speaking out against U.S. involvement in the war in the
Balkans. The way he sees it, another Vietnam quagmire is in the
making, and President Clinton and the nation are once again mired
``knee-deep in the Big Muddy.''
</P>
<P>
   But this time around, Hayden is not out in the streets,
bellowing distrust of the Establishment. Today he is part of the
Establishment, a 59-year-old graying California state senator from
the very wealthy west side of Los Angeles. His worries now are
mostly about things like schools and roads and whether he can
capture a seat in the state Assembly next year when the state's
term-limits law forces him out of the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there smolders in him some of the old liberal,
Democratic, anti-war fervor. And so the other day when he could
stand no longer to watch the wrenching television images coming at
him from the Balkans, he fired off an ``open letter'' to the White
House that had some of that old fervor, telling the president:
</P>
<P>
   ``When I watch the bombs over Serbia, I smell the stench of
hypocrisy. Why the Kosovars and not the Mayans or Rwandans? It can
only be a geopolitical abstraction like restoring U.S. dominance of
a new NATO. As you recall from Vietnam, Americans deeply resent
credibility gaps and official lies. Don't allow the Balkans to
become a Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, he told Los Angeles Times political columnist
George Skelton: ``I feel from my past that if we don't stop this
now, it's going to take us over.''
</P>
<P>
   Most recently in The Nation magazine, he wrote that the damage
caused by the bombing in the Balkans threatened to become
``collateral damage'' for the Democratic Party's hopes in Election
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Does he plan to take to the streets again?
</P>
<P>
   No, he says. But he acknowledges keeping in touch by computer
and telephone with some fellow agitators from the old anti-war
days.
</P>
<P>
   Is Someone Calling for a Third Party?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of all the candidates, announced and unannounced, in next year's
presidential race, the most improbable is probably Sen. Robert
Smith, a granite-hard Republican conservative from New Hampshire.
He has little money, little organization and almost no standing in
the polls, even in his home state, which, of course, holds the
first primary.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent poll of Republicans in Iowa, which holds the
first caucuses, he did not register at all. Zero. Zip. Zilch.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Smith plods on toward Election 2000, holding high the
banner of hard-right conservatism _ no surrender on keeping gun
rights, banning abortion, legalizing school prayer, strengthening
national defense and cutting taxes. Somebody has to do it, he says,
because other Republicans are caving in all around.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he began warning last week, if party leaders do not
stiffen and stop the backsliding, there is a danger that hard-core
conservatives would rebel and form a third party.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot more people talking about it than you think,''
Smith told The Washington Times on Monday. ``I'm worried for the
sake of my party. If you take the pro-life, pro-gun and Christian
conservative people out of the Republican Party, well, you don't
have a Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, campaigning in New Hampshire, he told reporters he
was not advocating formation of a third party. But he refused to
rule out joining one should it be formed, nor would he rule out
leading it if chosen.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't a third party formed by breakaway Republicans assure
election of another Democratic president?
</P>
<P>
   A third party led by the right candidate, he replied, would be a
formidable competitor in its own right.

DRUG AND ALCOHOL-RELATED ARRESTS INCREASE AT COLLEGES 
</HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Drug arrests rose by 7 percent and alcohol-related
arrests by more than 3 percent on college campuses in 1997, the
sixth consecutive year of increases, according to a survey being
released Monday by The Chronicle of Higher Education, a national
newspaper that covers education and academic life.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, alcohol-related arrests increased by 10 percent and
drug arrests by 5 percent. As in past years, college law
enforcement officials and administrators attributed the rise to
aggressive enforcement policies rather than to more use of drugs
and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is greater attention to security concerns at colleges
because the consumers _ parents _ forced schools to make campuses
safer,'' said S. Daniel Carter, the vice president of Security on
Campus Inc., a nonprofit organization based in King of Prussia,
Pa., that works with colleges and universities to prevent campus
crime and to deal with violators and victims. ``With the statistics
available now, you must face the issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter said that schools are reacting to campus violence and
other criminal behavior more thoroughly now than a decade ago,
focusing on the community's specific needs with better resources.
</P>
<P>
   According to the annual study, which tracked crime reports at
the nation's major colleges and universities, there were 7,897 drug
arrests in 1997, up from 7,370 in 1996, and 17,624 alcohol-related
arrests, up from 17,019 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Colleges are required by federal law to compile the number of
crimes reported on campus each year. The Chronicle's survey,
covering 483 four-year colleges and universities with more than
5,000 students each, is scheduled to appear on its Web site and in
the May 28 issue.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping pace with national trends, the number of robberies and
burglaries fell 9 percent in 1996 and 8 percent in 1997, for a
total of 14,837 in 1997. Motor vehicle thefts were down by 9
percent. Reports of aggravated assaults were down, and the number
of murders on campus fell after increases the previous two years,
from 15 in 1995 and 19 in 1996 to 13 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The number of reported sex assaults grew from 1,049 to 1,053.
Other sex offenses _ including statutory rape, incest, indecent
exposure and lewd behavior _ were down 29.5 percent to 93. But
safety experts noted that sex offenses are the crimes least likely
to be reported by victims.
</P>
<P>
   About 40 percent of the schools surveyed indicated that hate
crimes had occurred on their campuses in 1997; only about a third
reported this in the previous survey.
</P>
<P>
   The University of California at Berkeley (with an enrollment of
29,797), the top institution in drug arrests in 1996, topped the
list in 1997 with 179. It was followed again by San Jose State
University, with 162. There were 142 arrests at the University of
Arizona, 127 at Arizona State University and 126 at the University
of Utah.
</P>
<P>
   For the second year in a row, Michigan State University (with an
enrollment of 41,545) reported the highest number of
alcohol-related arrests, 633. Next came the University of
Minnesota-Twin Cities, with 555. They were followed by the
University of California at Berkeley, with 460; Western Michigan
University, with 401, and the University of Wisconsin at Madison,
with 342.

A SERB IN BELGRADE WHO DOCUMENTS KOSOVO'S HORROR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By CARLOTTA GALL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ Much of the time in Belgrade, it feels as
if nothing is happening in Kosovo. People complain endlessly about
the NATO bombing, and they talk politics all day, but there is a
large hole in the conversation. Barely anyone mentions Kosovo, let
alone the horrors that are occurring there.
</P>
<P>
   Natasa Kandic is one rare exception. She is a slight woman, with
dark circles etched under her eyes behind glasses. A sociologist by
profession, she heads the Humanitarian Law Center, a
nongovernmental group that has been documenting human rights
violations in Yugoslavia since 1992, and supplies material to the
international war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   As the political climate and restrictions on news media here
have made it impossible to publish material about human rights
violations, Ms. Kandic has resorted to writing and e-mailing a
newsletter to friends and to news and human rights organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intellectual society has changed here,'' she said, sitting
calmly in her modern offices in Belgrade drinking a mug of coffee.
``People saw only the bombs here, without thinking what is
happening in Kosovo and who is the person organizing it.''
</P>
<P>
   She is one of the few Serbian intellectuals to have maintained
close collaboration with ethnic Albanians on human rights issues,
and last year she won a prize for her work on democracy and civil
society, awarded jointly by the United States and the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
   She attributes the fact that she is practically alone in her
research on Kosovo to the climate of fear that has paralyzed the
intellectual community in Serbia, and the success of the state
propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights and civic groups have always been allowed to
operate in Serbia, tolerated by the government while they have
remained small. ``But for the first time people feel fear,'' Ms.
Kandic said.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, she said, several hundred people in Serbia,
including a number of her own employees, have been invited by the
police for an ``informal talk.'' They were questioned about their
work for the tribunal at The Hague, and about other organizations
and intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
   Several people have received anonymous letters full of abuse and
threats. A swastika, along with graffiti calling staff members
``NATO's spies,'' was daubed on the walls of the Fund for an Open
Society, which receives funding from the Soros Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   In everyone's mind, Ms. Kandic said, is the fatal shooting of a
well-known editor, Slavko Curuvija, after he received threats and
was denounced on state television. With representatives of the
international community largely gone from Belgrade, Curuvija's
death cowed everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two days was enough to establish silence,'' Ms. Kandic said.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has also been skillful at turning the NATO bombing
campaign to his advantage, exploiting the genuine outrage people
feel to block out all memory of why the bombing started. ``Official
propaganda succeeded in convincing people that it is aggression,
and that the national task is to defend the country,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sonja Licht, head of the Fund for an Open Society Yugoslavia,
said a great majority of people ``refuse to talk about'' Kosovo.
She gathered 27 democracy and human rights activists in Serbia to
sign a statement condemning both the NATO bombing and the ``ethnic
cleansing'' of Albanians from Kosovo, but even that was difficult.
</P>
<P>
   One journalist who is close to some of those who signed said,
``They fought over every word.'' In the end at least two people
refused to sign the statement, because they objected to the
inference that ``ethnic cleansing'' was perpetrated by ``Yugoslav
forces'' rather than only ``paramilitaries.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kandic refused to sign, because it did not go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those working for nongovernmental organizations accuse
the West of betraying them and destroying the burgeoning civil
society they were trying to create. The few organizations that do
function concentrate on the humanitarian needs of Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kandic, virtually alone, is pressing for international
support for the people left in Kosovo, and she has won respect
among Serbs and Albanians alike. Recently she sat reading a letter
sent by an Albanian friend in the southern Kosovo town of Prizren.
It was printed to disguise the writing and signed with just two
initials.
</P>
<P>
   The author described the hunger, fear and isolation of the
people left in the town and begged for international aid
organizations to come. ``If they do not come we shall die,'' the
letter said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Kandic said then that she had already decided on her next
trip, but some in Belgrade say Ms. Kandic is too reckless for her
own good.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after NATO began its bombing campaign, when foreign
journalists were expelled and Albanians were fleeing Kosovo, Ms.
Kandic got into a taxi and persuaded the driver to take her to
Pristina, the capital of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a human and professional obligation to go,'' she
explained. She had an office in Pristina, with six local staff
members, as well as many friends and colleagues in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Her first aim was to help them escape, but she was also
determined to document what had happened since March 24, not least
because a colleague and close friend, the human rights lawyer
Bajram Kelmendi, had been arrested by the police and was later
found dead along with his two sons.
</P>
<P>
   In one recent newsletter, she described the fear that gripped
members of her staff as she helped them escape Kosovo. She wrote
how she found her office ransacked, the computers gone and one of
her lawyers ``at his wit's end from terror.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had known he lived in fear that someone might come, knock on
his door and kill him,'' she said, ``but the terror I saw in his
eyes made up my mind then and there to depart immediately.''

OLIVETTI TAKES GAMBLE IN SEIZING TELECOM ITALIA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Germany, Italy)  (mk) 
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ In seizing control of stumbling Telecom Italia, Olivetti,
the former typewriter manufacturer that has become a powerful
European phone company, has embarked on a risky business gamble
that will reshuffle the European phone landscape.
</P>
<P>
   The deal attempts to restore direction and purpose to Telecom
Italia, Europe's fourth-largest phone company, which has gone
through three management shifts in the last two years, and now
faces a fourth. Olivetti, for its part, emerged only three years
ago from a major management reshuffling and redesigning of its
businesses, shedding interests in computers and office machinery in
favor of more profitable phone services.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Olivetti's management appears well aware that its
victory raises as many fresh challenges as it has resolved. Last
week, investors tendered Olivetti 51.02 percent of Telecom Italia
shares in the bid, which expired Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now comes the good part,'' Olivetti's chief executive, Roberto
Colaninno, the architect of the takeover, told associates.
</P>
<P>
   The 51 percent result, which will cost Olivetti almost $33
billion, will be financed in part by issuing bonds worth $7.9
billion, meaning that the debt burden ultimately falling on Telecom
Italia will be lighter than if Olivetti had won a higher stake. Yet
at the same time, the slim result means uncertain control. That
could become even more fragile if, as Olivetti plans, it dilutes
its share further by proceeding with a merger of Telecom Italia and
Tecnost, the Olivetti unit that is the financial vehicle for the
takeover.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Telecom Italia has had little luck in breaking
out of international isolation. Efforts to forge alliances with
Britain's Cable &AMP; Wireless and with AT&AMP;T in the United States
failed.
</P>
<P>
   Franco Bernabe, Telecom Italia's present chief executive, had
sought to deflect the Olivetti bid by arranging a merger with the
German phone giant, Deutsche Telekom, but an adviser to Colaninno
said Saturday that it was ``pretty unlikely'' that deal would now
proceed.
</P>
<P>
   The most far-reaching consequence of Olivetti's win may be the
agreement by Olivetti to cede its present telephone activities to
Mannesmann AG of Germany, its present phone partner, after the
Telecom Italia takeover becomes effective. Mannesmann, once best
known for steel pipes and heavy machinery, will pay $8 billion for
Olivetti's Italian phone businesses, thereby pushing forward its
strategy across Europe of lining up with the challengers to the old
national phone companies rather than with the less nimble former
national monopolies themselves. On Saturday, Mannesmann said it
will offer an option to Bell Atlantic, another partner, to acquire
an additional 2 percent of the Italian operation.

INTERNATIONAL RATES FOR PARCEL POST RISE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. Postal Service is raising rates for international
parcel post and for letters and cards to Canada and Mexico,
effective May 30.
</P>
<P>
   The sharpest rises come for parcel post, with the rate for a
two-pound surface parcel to Canada, for example, up 68 percent, to
$11.33. For a 2-pound surface parcel going outside North America,
the increase is 74 percent, to $15.70. But the increases are much
less for larger packages, and for Canada the surface rates for
parcels over 9 pounds actually decline.
</P>
<P>
   Air mail parcel post rates are also rising, with a 2-pound
package to Western Europe now costing $13.71, up 39 percent. Here
too, the increases are less for larger parcels.
</P>
<P>
   The basic rate for a half-ounce letter to Canada rises to 48
cents, from 46 cents, and a 1-ounce letter rises to 55 cents, from
52 cents.
</P>
<P>
   All international postcard rates rise 5 cents. The new rate to
Canada is 45 cents, to Mexico 40 cents and to all other countries
55 cents.

   LITTLETON, Colo. _ As Columbine High School seniors and their
relatives gathered in an open-air amphitheater for graduation
exercises Saturday morning, four seniors were missing from the 440
faces that appeared smiling only days ago in the pages of the new
class yearbook.
</P>
<P>
   Lauren Townsend, a straight-A student and captain of the girls'
varsity volleyball team, was to have been a valedictorian Saturday,
standing before her classmates spread over the green lawn of
Fiddler's Green Amphitheater.
</P>
<P>
   But Miss Townsend, who wanted to be a wildlife biologist, was
one of two seniors killed in the shooting that left 15 people dead
and 23 wounded at the school on April 20. Sunday, her older sister
and two older brothers, all Columbine graduates, went to the
ceremony to receive her diploma.
</P>
<P>
   Isaiah Shoels, who impatiently charted the dwindling days to
graduation by crossing dates off a calendar, also was killed. His
parents, who have already received his diploma, said they could not
bear to attend Saturday's ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Graduation day ``is going to be a very bad and sad day for me
and my family,'' Michael Shoels, Isaiah's father, said in an
interview Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The other two missing faces from the senior class Saturday were
Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, who committed suicide in the
school's library after carrying out the massacre.
</P>
<P>
   Their faces smile from the pages of the yearbook, which went to
press two months before the shooting. But Harris and Klebold were
left out of two memorial supplements, one for the yearbook and one
for the year-end issue of the school newspaper, The Courier. Their
names were not to be read at Saturday's ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Another missing face was that of William David Sanders, a
business teacher and coach, who was shot after directing dozens of
students to safety. A familiar presence at Columbine graduations,
Sanders joined the staff 25 years ago, a year after the school
opened.
</P>
<P>
   Three seniors who were injured in the shooting were to receive
their diplomas. Jeanna Park, Lisa Kreutz and Valeen Schnurr were
shot as they huddled under a table in the school library.
</P>
<P>
   The theme of Saturday's ceremony was triumph over adversity. On
a day devoted to students, Frank DeAngelis was one of two adults
scheduled to speak.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, at a memorial ceremony attended by President
Clinton that took on the air of a pep rally, DeAngelis, the
principal, said to the cheers of students: ``I look forward to the
day when we once again walk down the halls of Columbine High
School, holding our heads high. We want our school back.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton offered words of encouragement to the students, who for
the last three weeks have attended classes at Chatfield High
School, their longtime rival in athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two days from now you are going to have your commencement,''
the president said. ``It will be bittersweet. It will certainly be
different for those of you who are graduating than you thought it
was going to be when you were freshmen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But, as I understand it, there will be some compensations,''
he continued. ``Even your archrivals at Chatfield will be cheering
you on. When you hear those people cheer for you, I want you to
hear the voice of America, because America will be cheering on.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton joined her husband on Thursday in
congratulating the graduates and the entire student body.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened here at Columbine a month ago has had an impact
unlike any that I have ever seen or felt, _ it has pierced the
heart of America,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``But I hope you know that
the way you've conducted yourselves, and your story, and the
stories of those killed and injured have been an inspiration and a
motivation for many people whom you'll never meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're inspired by the strength of the students and the
teachers, by your determination to return to school to finish out
your year with your friends and your classmates,'' she added.
``We're inspired by your refusal to let violence and hatred win.''
</P>
<P>
   Heather Dinkel, the Columbine student body president, sounded
the same theme in a letter published Friday in USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we take those last steps of high school across the stage,
we will not be alone,'' Miss Dinkel, a senior, wrote. ``Everyone
who has sent us a letter or card, left flowers or wept by
themselves for the loss of precious lives, will be with us.''
</P>
<P>
   At other graduation ceremonies across the greater Denver area
Saturday, seniors pinned to their clothes or to their black gowns
ribbons of blue and silver, the colors of Columbine.

ANALYSIS: MEXICAN PARTY FLIRTS WITH DEMOCRATIC WAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Long before governing party politicians were
finished casting ballots last week on how to change the way their
presidential nominee is chosen, party leaders were busy handing out
advance copies of a speech thanking them for selecting the method
preferred by President Ernesto Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   The politicians were selecting among four new ways of choosing
the nominee, including Zedillo's proposal to use a primary
election, which the party calls ``direct consultation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much for your vote in
favor of direct consultation,'' the speech began. ``This is the
option that will democratize the party.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether that is indeed the case, however, has fast become a
national riddle, and Mexicans are obsessed with it.
</P>
<P>
   The politicians gathered at the conference of the governing
Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, voted as
Zedillo wanted. And the incident was one of several last week that
left Mexicans uncertain whether the party was truly embracing
democracy or simply freshening up democratic appearances, which
have been crucial throughout its 70-year domination of Mexican
politics.
</P>
<P>
   In a long, unbroken tradition, Mexican presidents from the
governing party have chosen their own successors, and the party has
never lost a presidential vote.
</P>
<P>
   A new book, ``The Inheritance,'' which describes in play-by-play
detail how the last five Mexican presidents named their successors,
is a huge best seller; it has sold 115,000 copies in the month
since its publication. In it, its author, political scientist Jorge
Castaneda, offers numerous examples of how democratic appearances
have masked authoritarian traditions within the party.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, for example, President Gustavo Diaz Ordaz had decided
to name Interior Minister Luis Echeverria Alvarez as the candidate,
Castaneda says. But then in a meeting with nine top party leaders,
the president attributed the decision to labor union chiefs,
peasant leaders and the party rank-and-file.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a distinguished member of our party, I've been commissioned
to tell you,'' Diaz said, according to Castaneda. ``I understand
that all of you have arrived at the same conclusion. I congratulate
you on your decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The new rules that the party adopted last week abolished this
tradition, known as the ``dedazo,'' literally the tapping of the
candidate. Instead, the party voted Monday to schedule a nationwide
primary for Nov. 7 to elect its presidential nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a revolution in the PRI's rules,'' said Luis Rubio, a
political analyst with a Mexico City research institute. ``The
president just can't decide who the candidate will be anymore.
That's an enormous change.''
</P>
<P>
   Other recent electoral reforms have allowed opposition parties
to win control of Mexico's congress and a third of the
governorships, and have given them a credible chance at winning the
presidency next year; the governing party candidate can no longer
count on coasting to victory in the general elections.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo referred to this rising opposition challenge when he
first outlined his plan for a primary election to party leaders in
March, arguing that heightened democracy within the party would
foster the unity that has become crucial to its continued electoral
success. Yet in the days after the party adopted his proposals
Monday, traditions associated with the dedazo re-emerged, raising
questions about just how much the party is actually changing.
</P>
<P>
   Since February, analysts have been saying that Zedillo's
preferred choice was Interior Minister Francisco Labastida Ochoa.
And one day after the party changed its rules, Labastida announced
his presidential candidacy. Hundreds of government officials,
leaders of party-affiliated labor and peasant organizations and at
least one mariachi band packed into a convention center, whooping
in delirium as Labastida made his announcement.
</P>
<P>
   One party labor leader shrieked with joy into television cameras
broadcasting the spectacle live, nationwide: ``We have a candidate!
We have a candidate!''
</P>
<P>
   Several prominent millionaires and a string of governing party
governors spoke out to glorify Labastida as a brilliant leader, and
two party politicians who had been seen as potential rivals to
Labastida quickly bowed out of the race, one of them praising
Labastida as he did so.
</P>
<P>
   After their withdrawals, Labastida's only remaining rivals for
the party nomination were Roberto Madrazo Pintado, the governor of
Tabasco, Manuel Bartlett Diaz, the former governor of Puebla, and
Humberto Roque Villanueva, a former congressman. And there were
doubts about how seriously they could compete with Labastida.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the opposition parties lampooned the week's theatrics
as a traditional governing party ritual, known as the ``la
cargada,'' the charge, or ``la bufalada,'' the buffalo stampede, in
which party leaders rush to proclaim publicly their loyalty to the
official candidate once the President has made his choice known.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not even their grandmother believes it when they say this is
the end of the dedazo,'' said Vicente Fox Quezada, the likely
presidential candidate of the pro-business National Action Party.
</P>
<P>
   Porfirio Munoz Ledo, who is seeking the presidential nomination
from the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution, called the
outpouring of praise for Labastida ``the consecration of the
president's candidate in the oldest style of Mexican
authoritarianism.''
</P>
<P>
   Numerous newspaper columnists and political cartoonists agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's clear is that Labastida is now alone as the President's
candidate,'' the newspaper Reforma said in its main editorial
column on Thursday. ``The PRI still doesn't understand the word
democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sergio Sarmiento, a prominent columnist, wrote Labastida ``is
now seen as the beneficiary of a new type of presidential dedazo.''
</P>
<P>
   John Bailey, a Mexico specialist at Georgetown University, said
Zedillo wants to reduce his own influence in selecting the
candidate and give the party a larger role, but that 70 years of
party traditions will die hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``A vote will be taking place, that's new,'' Bailey said. ``But
there's a culture within the PRI in which everybody waits around
trying to figure out the party line, so they can position
themselves around it. There's an almost military discipline to obey
the president.''

CLINTON DECISION ON TROOPS IS CONSISTENT WITH SOME EXPERT VIEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By NEIL MacFARQUHAR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's decision to press for quick
deployment of 50,000 NATO troops on Kosovo's border is in tune with
the views of military and Balkans experts who in recent weeks have
said that ground troops are essential to resolving the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The troops will be needed even in the case of a negotiated
settlement, they said, and the faster they get to the region, the
faster such a resolution may emerge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation right now in Kosovo calls for ground troops,''
said Gen. John Galvin, who retired as head of NATO forces in Europe
in 1992, and is now dean of the Fletcher School of Law and
Diplomacy at Tufts University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you have to be a military person to see that you
need military forces on the ground there to reestablish security
and stability, so people can get back to living their lives,'' he
said. ``Hopefully it can be done through a peacetime environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, after eight weeks of aerial bombing, they still see few
signals that President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia is disposed
to accept NATO's demand for an international force entering Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Balkans experts point out that the early deployment of
NATO forces in the region, whether or not the troops eventually
enter Kosovo, could help shape a settlement in NATO's favor. But
they caution that troops should not be deployed unless political
leaders are prepared to use them if a settlement does not
materialize or if one collapses.
</P>
<P>
   At best, if Milosevic yields to a negotiated compromise, ground
troops will deploy in Kosovo to keep the peace. At worst, if no
settlement emerges, these experts say, ground troops may have to
fight their way into the southern Serbian province in an attempt to
stave off an embarrassing defeat.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, troops are crucial, especially if NATO is to
insure the return of the hundreds of thousands of Albanians who
have been forced out of Kosovo by Serb forces, a goal that many
experts say they fear NATO has lost sight of.
</P>
<P>
   The air campaign, they say, has done little toward attaining
that end so far. The experts are divided, however, on how far the
alliance should go in using ground troops to get the refugees home,
and they are somewhat reluctant to second-guess military commanders
on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bombing has not been sufficient to cause a genuine change
in the Serbian position, so we should not move into the negotiating
phase until there is clear evidence that the bombing has taken its
toll on Milosevic,'' said Warren Zimmerman, the last U.S.
ambassador to Yugoslavia, who served from 1989 to 1992 and is
currently a professor at Columbia University.
</P>
<P>
   ``The further we go in destroying the Serbs' military power,''
he said, ``the more chance that Milosevic will not last in
office.''
</P>
<P>
   If a negotiated settlement falls short of NATO's goal, Zimmerman
believes that the Serbian leadership could still threaten Kosovo's
Albanian population. Such an end would let stand the injustice of
``ethnic cleansing,'' he said, would destabilize the surrounding
states and ``would continue in power the most repressive
dictatorship in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   Western powers were similarly divided about using military power
to force an end to the three-year war in Bosnia that started in
1992. Eventually air power, combined with local Croatian and
Bosnian Muslim ground troops, pushed the Serbs to settle _ after
some 250,000 people had been killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``One should have learned from Bosnia that delaying means
accepting many more casualties in advance,'' said Hans van den
Broek, the Dutch foreign minister from 1982 to 1993 and now the
European commissioner responsible for East European affairs.
</P>
<P>
   More than 850,000 Albanian refugees from Kosovo have flooded
into Macedonia, Albania and Montenegro, the other republic inside
Yugoslavia, and threaten to overwhelm those areas by altering their
own fragile ethnic mixes and taxing their limited resources.
</P>
<P>
   The key question in any settlement, said Barnett Rubin, a Kosovo
specialist at the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations, is
whether enough Serbian forces will withdraw from Kosovo to convince
the refugees that it is safe to go home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't reverse the deaths or the rapes,'' Rubin said, ``but
we can reverse the ethnic cleansing.'' Otherwise, he added, ``It
will be a Palestinian problem in Europe _ a permanent refugee
underclass in Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has been criticized repeatedly since the
bombing started for precluding the use of ground forces,
advertising to the Serbs in advance that the campaign would be
limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were Milosevic, I would be more encouraged than I was at
the beginning,'' said retired Gen. Brent Scowcroft, who was
President George Bush's national security adviser during the
Persian Gulf war. ``Milosevic thinks he doesn't have to worry about
anything further. All the signals we're sending to him are the
wrong signals, other than saying we are going to go on bombing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the event of a land war, the most frequently repeated
estimate is that 100,000 NATO troops would be needed to push about
40,000 Serbian soldiers and military police out of Kosovo, an area
about half the size of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   But experts disagree on what such a force's mandate might be.
Some say it might include a far wider war with an invasion of
Serbia beyond Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has two forces _ the Allied Command Europe Mobile Force and
the Rapid Reaction Corps _ both of which were assembled after the
Cold War to make NATO troops more flexible in a crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Both are drawn from the armies of at least 10 members, the first
consisting of about 7,000 advance troops and the second made up of
a full division of about 15,000 troops from each country. Both
consistently train together. Military experts said the forces would
not be troubled by the mountainous terrain that runs along Kosovo's
borders with Albania and Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Milosevic still has the initiative and until we get
the initiative away from him he will dictate the pace of
settlement,'' said Gen. George Joulwan, who preceded Gen. Wesley
Clark as supreme allied commander in Europe, serving from 1993 to
1997. ``Bombing alone won't take the initiative away.''

 &HT;    Strike zone adjustment goes slowly
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a tirade better directed at his own stratospheric ERA than at
the men in blue, the Chicago White Sox's Jaime Navarro finally had
had enough last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The umpires are supposed to be working on a new strike zone,''
Navarro said after Cleveland mauled him for nine runs, ``and they
aren't working on anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Navarro spoke, if somewhat loudly, for nearly everyone in the
majors. The predicament is wonderfully baseball, a game where the
foul poles are fair. The new, improved strike zone, which has been
used as a scapegoat for virtually every woe, including Greg
Maddux's mysterious vulnerability, hasn't really expanded at all.
Umpires were instructed to tighten the strike zone on the corners
and increase the height of the zone, creating the high strike
possibility for pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   But it's become a matter of interpretation.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the exception of a couple guys, there's not much
difference,'' said Atlanta shortstop Walt Weiss, a connoisseur of
the strike zone. ``I thought there was in spring training, maybe
the first week or two. But I think, gradually, it's gotten back to
what it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball, which touched the match to the issue on
Feb. 19 with the infamous ``high strike'' directive to its umpires,
naturally thinks otherwise. With a fourth of the season gone, clubs
are hitting .272, a six-point increase from a year ago, and bases
on balls have increased nearly one-half walk per nine innings. Only
two clubs entered the weekend with ERAs under 4.00, as opposed to
eight in 1993, all of which suggests that pitchers have been forced
to work the true outside corner and are paying the price.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on our observational and empirical data, the strike zone
is being called in and out more consistently on the plate,'' said
Sandy Alderson, baseball's vice president for operations and the
author of the ``high strike'' document. ``In the lower end of the
strike zone, the pitch at the knee is also being called more
consistently right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's the upper end of the strike zone, the high strike,
that is still causing some trouble for some umpires,'' Alderson
said, ``and we thought going in that would be the hardest pitch for
some umpires to adjust to.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet other evidence suggests that little has changed. The average
major-league at-bat, according to STATS Inc., is right at 3.72
pitches, consistent with the rest of the decade. Hitters were
striking out just as frequently on the older strike zone three
years ago, 6.5 per nine innings.
</P>
<P>
   And if baseball's hope was to give pitchers a new area to
exploit with the high strike, it has not happened. Only a handful
of hard throwers, including Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling, can
get away with the overpowering high fastball at the navel, and like
the umpires, they aren't comfortable throwing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't do me good,'' Philadelphia's Schilling said. ``I
don't want to throw pitches up for strikes, anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   All that has really changed is the interpretation of the new
strike zone, not the zone itself, a troubling state for those who
make their living around its edges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It fluctuates. I thought it was pretty consistent before,''
Atlanta pitching coach Leo Mazzone said. ``I knew what the strike
zone was last year, and then I saw it change. As far as calling the
high strike, you can forget about that. So if you don't call the
high strike and you narrow the corners, it's smaller.''
</P>
<P>
   That result hardly was the original intent. Bud Selig made
umpiring one of his first issues after becoming full-time
commissioner last year. Baseball was mortified by umpire Eric
Gregg's coast-to-coast strike zone in Livan Hernandez's
15-strikeout performance in Game 5 of the 1997 NLCS against the
Braves. Further concern followed from the twin first-inning
ejections of Cleveland's Doc Gooden and Mike Hargrove in Game 2 of
last year's American League Division Series.
</P>
<P>
   Conforming the strike zone to the written rule _ ``midpoint
between the top of the shoulders and the top of the uniform pants''
to ``the hollow beneath the kneecap'' _ was made clear in
Alderson's Feb. 19 memo. The Umpires Association called the
initiative ``deplorable.'' The Players Association, in a rare move,
lauded baseball's move. The players remained privately suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weren't they supposed to start calling the high strike eight
years ago?'' asked Atlanta's Maddux, who has been unwilling to
blame his implausible 5.02 ERA on the strike zone. ``I just think
it's tough to change. You've been calling balls and strikes for 15
years, and then they ask you to change the way you see a strike. I
think that's asking a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw in spring training there was a conscious effort being
made,'' Braves second baseman Bret Boone said. ``I don't think
there is now. I think the whole thing is being blown a little bit
out of proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell that to Tom Glavine, who concedes that his early
problems this season were caused by trying to break his change-up
closer to the outside corner. That effort caused mechanical
problems with his delivery that only now, after three victories in
four decisions, seem corrected.
</P>
<P>
   And if Maddux, whose 88 hits are the most allowed in the majors,
won't blame the strike zone, others will for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he wants to say that's his biggest problem right
now,'' catcher Eddie Perez said. ``But I think it is. Maybe he
won't agree with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the majors, managers have worked to reduce the anxiety of
their clubs, who perceive a new strike zone as making an already
difficult game unfair. Navarro's tirade this week verbalized much
of the early off-the-record clubhouse sentiment. After the Phillies
beat Cincinnati 1-0 in extra innings earlier this year while
Schilling struck out nine, Reds manager Jack McKeon sent this
message to his players griping about the strike zone: ``My father
always told me it is better to be thought a fool than to open your
mouth and remove all doubt. Some of our players need to hear
that.''
</P>
<P>
   None of it has been easy on umpires. To make the corners easier
to monitor, some umpires dictate strict observance of the catcher's
box. With catchers unable to move more than a few inches outside to
frame the plate, the hope was that the umpires would get an
unobstructed view of the two inches on either side of the
17-inch-wide plate.
</P>
<P>
   But the obscure rule has not been enforced consistently. For
example, Bruce Froemming, the NL's senior ump, repeatedly allowed
Javy Lopez to set up Wednesday with a foot outside the box.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the umpires really need to do is stay behind the middle
of the plate, instead of chasing the catchers,'' said Astros
manager Larry Dierker, who pitched 14 big-league seasons. ``If they
stay in the middle and call the corners, I think both the hitters
and the pitchers will be satisfied with the results.''
</P>
<P>
   As the zone reconformed slowly to its old dimensions, many in
the game _ and most of the umpires _ view the issue as having less
to do with ball and strikes and more to do with umpire control.
Selig has made it clear he intends to take charge of the current
system, with the eventual goal of eliminating exclusivity between
leagues in favor of one umpire pool.
</P>
<P>
   As the umpire's union has gained strength since two work
stoppages last decade, baseball has become frustrated in monitoring
ump performance and almost powerless in disciplining umpires or
removing inept ones. The umpires' current work agreement expires
after this season, and umpires see Selig's intentions as a clear
threat to their power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commissioner has made it clear that starting next season,
he intends for the umpires to fall under the authority of the
commissioner's office,'' Alderson said. ``He just felt the strike
zone was something that couldn't wait until next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, some umpires have viewed that with more draconian intent
than the facts support,'' he said. ``But the fact remains, the
commissioner will take over supervision of the umpires next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: The 1999 interpretation of the strike zone will be
nothing compared with 2000's labor interpretation. Until then, the
game only seeks order at the plate. And slowly, it is emerging.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when this all blows over,'' Boone said, ``it will all
go back to where it was.''

 &HT;    Bucs tailor offense to Dilfer
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has become chic to blame quarterback Trent Dilfer for the
failures of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' offense, and general manager
Rich McKay and coach Tony Dungy unwittingly added to the pressure
in the past month by trading for Eric Zeier and using a
second-round pick on prospect Shaun King of Tulane.
</P>
<P>
   Dilfer's shaky play aside, there's still a lot of culpability to
go around in an ill-designed attack that rated 27th in passing in
1998 and 22nd overall. Dungy steadfastly defended coordinator Mike
Shula, youngest son of Hall of Fame coach Don Shula, a year ago but
has decided he might need some assistance. So Dungy reassigned
tight ends coach Clyde Christensen to coach the quarterbacks. Early
results have been promising.
</P>
<P>
   At the behest of Dilfer, a five-year veteran who has slimmed to
232 pounds, Christensen and Shula quietly are revamping the Tampa
Bay passing game. Stealing a page from Dan Reeves' design, they
will add more seven-step drops that will permit Dilfer to throw the
deep ball off play-action, a strength he shares with Atlanta's
Chris Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches cleared up the misconception that Dilfer didn't like the
offensive plan, which featured running backs Mike Alstott and
Warrick Dunn, and that he preferred to throw the ball more than the
26.8 times per game he averaged in 1998. And in taking Darnell
McDonald of Kansas State in the seventh round, the Bucs not only
got one of the best bargains in the draft, but added a bigger wide
receiver to a group of small players _ Reidel Anthony, Bert Emanuel
and Jacquez Green.
</P>
<P>
   If the offseason moves succeed, Tampa Bay, a disappointing 8-8
last year, could be one of the top bounce-back teams of 1999. If
they fail, Dilfer could be bounced, period.
</P>
<P>
   Tip sheet
</P>
<P>
   Brett Favre credits the fact that he will turn 30 in four months
for his new sobriety and more family-oriented lifestyle. Green Bay
insiders, however, credit his wife, Deanna, who is pregnant and due
to deliver the couple's second daughter on Aug. 17. ... John Elway,
who will meet in coming days with Eli Broad, one of the men
attempting to bring an expansion franchise to Los Angeles, has
decided he probably won't attempt a TV career in 1999. Elway would
prefer to work in a front office with the kind of
general-manager-in-training role Dwight Clark once had with the
49ers. ... For the second time in six months, local agent Hadley
Engelhard is forced to negotiate an injury settlement for a client
whose NFL career was cut short by back problems. The Carolina
Panthers used a third-round pick in '98 on Penn defensive lineman
Mitch Marrow, who sat out his entire rookie season. Now Marrow has
been advised to retire because of a back injury similar to the one
that forced another Engelhard client, former Georgia Tech center
Michael Cheever, out of the game.... Add wide receiver Johnnie
Morton to a lengthening list of Detroit Lions veterans growing
weary of coach Bobby Ross. ... Florida State wide receiver Peter
Warrick continues to insist he will not leave the Seminoles and
petition the league for a special supplemental draft this summer.
One receiver who is making some noise about a supplemental draft,
however, is R. Jay Soward of USC. ... With youngsters Shaun
Williams and Percy Ellworth pushing for playing time, the New York
Giants will consider releasing troubled free safety Tito Wooten
after June 1. ... In what might be the latest indication that Gene
Williams isn't part of the team's plans for '99, the Falcons
recently moved second-year guard Bob Hallen from the left side to
the right side. ... New England is seeking a veteran tailback, but
don't believe the rumors that the Patriots will take a chance on
Lawrence Phillips, who is leading the NFL Europe League in rushing.

 &HT;    Contract consensus: Saints rooked Williams
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Heisman running back Ricky Williams signed a deal with the New
Orleans Saints that requires him to reach extraordinary performance
levels or settle for the NFL equivalent of chump change. By doing
so, Williams could further polarize league owners and player agents
and significantly slow the pace of first-round agreements.
</P>
<P>
   In signing the seven-year contract, Williams became a hero to
owners and a bona fide member of the proletariat. And he and
representative Leland Hardy became easy targets for agents
accustomed to negotiating contracts based more on potential than
production.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Brown, owner of the Cincinnati Bengals, views the Williams
deal as a landmark case, a play-for-pay agreement that forces a
prospect to fulfill his potential. But agents have vowed that the
contract will not start a trend.
</P>
<P>
   Agents insist that paying players according to their draft
status will remain the norm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans think it's great, I'm sure, because it's all based on
incentives,'' Atlanta area agent Hadley Engelhard said. ``The truth
is, it's a terrible deal. As the fifth player taken in the draft,
(Williams) is entitled to the fifth-best contract. For him to
collect all this money he's talked about, though, is unrealistic.
The odds are stacked against him.''
</P>
<P>
   Even league salary-cap experts concede that the Saints snookered
Hardy.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a contract that gives Williams, who played at the
University of Texas, the maximum signing bonus under the league's
rookie salary pool, $8.84 million. But $5 million will be deferred
until next year. Williams will receive the minimum salaries of
$175,000, $250,000 and $325,000 for his first three seasons. But
unless he averages 1,600 yards during his first four NFL seasons, a
feat accomplished by only Terrell Davis and Eric Dickerson, he will
continue to earn minimum base salaries throughout his career.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that triggers higher salaries during the second
half of Williams' deal is the 1,600-yard average, a number probably
unattainable if he is injured. In four college seasons, Williams
averaged 1,570 yards per year.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy, an honors graduate of the renowned Wharton School of
Business at the University of Pennsylvania, is an inexperienced
player agent who had never done an NFL deal. He declined counsel
from the NFL Players Association while working the contract, and he
often was distracted by telephone calls from tennis star Venus
Williams, who was in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Now Brown must hammer out a contract with quarterback Akili
Smith, the Bengals' first-round pick, and for the fifth time in 12
years he will face off against agent Leigh Steinberg in
negotiations. Steinberg created the concepts of ``voidable years''
and ``buybacks,'' two formulas most used to circumvent salary-cap
restraints for rookies. The thrifty Brown, who can't even get
Steinberg to return calls, likes the Williams deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the kind of concept we have in mind,'' Brown said. ``If
Akili plays well and we win, he'll be paid well. If not ...''
</P>
<P>
   Other owners have thought about using the concept but say they
have little shot of gaining concessions from players and agents.
Several said that Hardy set the bar too high for his client and
erred in not including ``rollovers'' _ incentives that would become
base salary in subsequent seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The Williams contract includes 26 benchmarks that could earn
annual incentives of $50,000 each. But the contract shows that
those bonuses can't exceed $500,000 in a given year and that some
of them _ such as getting 12 touchdown catches in a season _ are
unrealistic. In addition, Williams faces four weigh-ins annually
and must repay the Saints $25,000 anytime he weighs more than 240
pounds. Staying svelte might be difficult for a player who ate 11
doughnuts after his April 6 workout for NFL scouts, then had four
desserts at an April 7 dinner with New Orleans club executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clear from what I've seen that the contract is a
gamble,'' agent Kenny Zuckerman said. ``It's well below the market
value. If he explodes in the first couple years, he will be
dramatically underpaid.

PUEBLO INDIANS RECEIVE REMAINS OF ANCESTORS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Spain, Great Britain)   By CATHERINE C. ROBBINS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PECOS, N.M. _ Pecos and Jemez Pueblo Indians welcomed home the
remains of nearly 2,000 of their ancestors early Saturday morning,
with about 1,000 Pueblos and well-wishers walking with a semi-truck
carrying the remains and hundreds of artifacts for the final mile
of the truck's 2,200-mile journey.
</P>
<P>
   The truck had left Cambridge, Mass., on Wednesday with its cargo
from museums at Harvard University and Phillips Academy at Andover,
headed to the Pueblos' ancestral village in Pecos, N.M., escorted
by National Park Service rangers and leaders from the Pueblo of
Jemez.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting for the procession to begin, Juan Ray Tafoya, 87, wept
quietly, dabbing at his eyes. His grandson Bryan wrapped an arm
around the old man's shoulders and spoke to him gently in Towa, the
native language of the Jemez Indians. ``He wants to walk the last
mile,'' explained the younger man. ``It's spiritual for him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Anita Armijo, Tafoya's daughter, prevailed and put him on a
van that was shuttling the elderly to the site of the reburial.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal leaders led the procession, including the Pecos governor,
Ruben Sando, who carried the ceremonial cane of authority given to
the Pecos Tribe by King Philip III of Spain in 1620. Joshua
Madalena, the tribe's cultural officer, described the mood of the
people as one of ``spiritual excitement.'' Madalena spent last week
in Cambridge, helping with the reparations of the remains and
artifacts according to the 1990 Native American Graves Protection
and Repatriation Act.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard returned the skeletal remains, which were excavated by
the archeologist Alfred Kidder in the early part of this century,
in what experts call the largest repatriation in the nation's
history.
</P>
<P>
   The remains were reburied Saturday with sacred items in a
private ceremony in the 7,000-acre Pecos National Historical Park,
about 30 miles southeast of Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Jemez Indians at Saturday's ceremony had walked for
three days, crossing mesas, mountains and the Rio Grande, in a
reverse re-creation of a similar walk in the 19th century. Pecos
was a thriving pueblo and trading center with about 3,000
inhabitants when Spaniards found it in 1540, but by 1838, the
population had been reduced by warfare and disease to about two
dozen. The remaining Pecos residents abandoned their pueblo and
walked to the Pueblo of Jemez, joining with kin to whom they are
related by language, culture and religion.
</P>
<P>
   The remains, which date from the 12th century to the 19th, were
reburied at the park because the Indians consider it a sacred
ancestral site, despite its being owned and managed by the National
Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   The Pueblo of Pecos was designated as a national monument in
1965, through the efforts of the actress Greer Garson and her
husband, E.E. Fogelson, who lived in Santa Fe. Some of the ruins of
the pueblo and the church built by the Spaniards have been
restored.
</P>
<P>
   The return of the remains has been accompanied by mixed
feelings, said Randolph Padilla, a former governor of the Pueblo of
Jemez. Padilla said that when he first saw the stacks of boxes
holding the bodies at Harvard, he was overwhelmed with sadness. But
with the reburial, he said, the Jemez people felt ``jubilation that
our ancestors are coming home.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's reburial was followed by a celebration picnic. ``It's
like the whole family getting together at Christmas, a reunion,''
said Raymond Gachupin, governor of the Pueblo of Jemez. ``You feel
fulfilled.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Jurisdiction over the remains is split, said Duane Alire, the
superintendent of the historical park. The Jemez Indians own the
remains from Harvard and those of seven individuals that the
National Park Service has also returned. The park service prepared
the burial area, which has no markers to identify its location.
</P>
<P>
   The return of the remains has raised some unexpected questions
for the Jemez people. For instance, although Pueblos have a burial
ceremony for returning the dead to Mother Earth, the idea of
reburial was foreign to the Pueblos, said Padilla, who is also a
coordinator for the repatriation activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a reburial ceremony,'' he said. ``We've never
had to do that. We went back and forth with religious leaders to
decide what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The tribe decided on a basic service based on the original
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   At Jemez Day School, a Bureau of Indian Affairs elementary
school, Paul Tosa had another task added to his usual year-end job
of readying his sixth-grade students for graduation to middle
school: He also explained the repatriation, which he said was an
event as momentous for the Jemez as the Civil War was for the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   The students were full of questions about the repatriation
process and the remains themselves. ``The big issue is why so
many,'' Tosa said. Other questions followed, he said: ``Why from
Pecos so far over there? Who gave them permission? Why has it taken
so long to get them back?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For answers, Tosa, a Pecos descendant and former governor of the
Pueblo of Jemez, relied on the history he has been teaching them
all year. The history curriculum begins with the stories of the
Jemez and Pecos people that Tosa has heard since childhood from his
father and grandfather, who heard them from their own grandfathers.
</P>
<P>
   Tosa integrates the Pueblo stories into Greek mythology and
European and American history. On the walls of his classroom, he
has hung pictures of the Hubble telescope and fossils alongside
hand-lettered posters of native stories and newspaper clippings
about contemporary American Indian issues.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Tosa said he had difficulty explaining to an outsider the
balancing act he performs in answering the children's questions.
Part of the problem is that his stories compete with modern life.
Another barrier is the complexity of the Towa language spoken by
most of the pueblo's residents. The children might learn that
``scientist'' means someone who is here just to study. In the
context of archeological activities, Tosa said, that word acquires
another connotation in the Towa language, namely, a scientist is
someone who creates ``a disturbance.''
</P>
<P>
   Tosa's ancestors have been laid to rest in what is an
archeological treasure house.
</P>
<P>
   The national park is on a rocky promontory surrounded by the
broad, lush valley of the Upper Pecos River. It tells centuries of
stories. The most visible ruins are tall, stark adobe walls of the
Spanish mission church. But to the west of the church is the
ancestral Pecos village, built by Rio Grande Pueblo Indians _
perhaps even by some of those reburied there Saturday _ beginning
in the 12th century.
</P>
<P>
   A series of mounds covered with grasses, shrubs, wildflowers and
dirt are the telltale signs of unexcavated archeological sites.
Their stone outcroppings mark the remnants of the four- or
five-story buildings with nearly 700 rooms _ the homes of the
Pueblo people who came home today.

SEAT-BELT CAMPAIGN SET FOR HOLIDAY WEEKEND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Calif., Kan., N.H., Ore., Pa., S.D., Wis., Wyo.)  (rk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Police agencies are planning another highly
publicized enforcement blitz to encourage people to wear seat belts
during the Memorial Day weekend, as safety experts have concluded
that the twice-yearly crackdowns are causing lasting increases in
the numbers of people who buckle up.
</P>
<P>
   With the support of 42 governors, more than 5,000 police
agencies will join the effort, according to the Air Bag and Seat
Belt Safety Campaign, an advertising and advocacy program whose
sponsors include government agencies, insurance companies, auto
companies and auto parts suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years they sponsored similar events around
Thanksgiving and Memorial Day, two of the busiest driving holidays
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The governors signed a statement calling for ``highly visible
enforcement and the adoption of a policy of zero tolerance for
unbuckled kids.'' By emphasizing protection of children, the
crackdown seeks to avoid a backlash from adult drivers who feel the
police should not interfere with their own seat-belt decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drivers who allow children to ride unrestrained should be
stopped and enforcement action taken,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   All 50 states have laws allowing police officers to stop cars
and ticket drivers if children are not in a child seat or in a belt
appropriate for their size. Only 19 states have a similar law for
adults; most states allow the police to write tickets for not
wearing a belt only if the car was pulled over for some other
reason. The one holdout, New Hampshire, does not require belt use
by adults.
</P>
<P>
   At the National Safety Council, a nonprofit organization
supported by the insurance industry that is helping organize the
blitz, Chuck Hurley, a spokesman, said, ``Nobody in this country
has a right to put a child at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurley and others credit previous coordinated enforcement
campaigns with increasing belt use. The rate of seat-belt
compliance for all people in vehicles, as measured by observers
standing by the roadside, improved after the first blitz, during
Thanksgiving 1997, and jumped to 70 percent from 62 percent after
the enforcement blitz over Memorial Day weekend in 1998, according
to Department of Transportation statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Experts believe it rose again after last Thanksgiving. The
Transportation Department said in February that the increase in
belt use in 1998, if it is permanent, would cut the number of
deaths by 1,500 annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suppose you were running a medical trial with a vaccine, and
you saved 1,500 lives; would you do it again?'' Hurley asked.
</P>
<P>
   Experts would like to raise the U.S. average in seat-belt use to
levels already achieved in California and Canada, both over 90
percent. The Department of Transportation last year estimated that
raising the level to 90 percent from 68 percent would save 5,500
lives a year, and cut the number of serious injuries by 133,000.
</P>
<P>
   States will conduct their efforts in different ways. Many will
set up roadblocks and checkpoints. That is uncommon in New York
City, but the police will set up such a checkpoint on Thursday, in
front of the Javits Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   The governors who had not signed on, as of Friday, were those of
Wisconsin, South Dakota, Alabama, Wyoming, Texas, Pennsylvania,
Oregon and Kansas.

HOW REPUBLICANS MISSED THE MARK ON GUN CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Idaho, R.I., Va.)  (lb) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL and FRANK BRUNI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Across the chaotic Senate struggle over gun
control, Sen. Larry Craig of Idaho, a champion of gun rights,
played scrambling quarterback for his fellow Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Craig, a board member of the National Rifle Association, turned
his hideaway Capitol office into a place for huddles with the
group's lobbyists. Yet no matter how they tried to turn back the
Democrats on gun control, they failed.
</P>
<P>
   As disgruntled Republicans tried this weekend to sort out how
they had allowed the Democrats to gain control of the Senate's
agenda, they pointed to miscalculations by Sen. Trent Lott, their
majority leader, and by Craig and other Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say the party was drawn into a fight before it was
ready, hastily put together flawed answers to Democratic proposals
and had little sense of where its caucus actually stood.
</P>
<P>
   They failed to recognize the image that would be created by
allowing Craig to act as their most visible figure, some
Republicans said.
</P>
<P>
   And most startling of all, they created for Vice President Al
Gore a heady turn in the spotlight on Thursday as he cast a rare
tie-breaking vote to pass a Democratic measure to require
background checks at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all hurrying,'' Craig said. ``I like time to shape an
issue, to know where my membership is, so that I have no surprises.
We were simply not afforded that luxury.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican, who did not want to be named, said, ``They
were not clearly thinking through where the Republicans were going
to be, post-Littleton, that we need to adapt to the world of today,
not the world of five years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   By not making that readjustment, the Republicans allowed Senate
passage of the first significant gun-control legislation in five
years and gave momentum to the Democrats. President Clinton on
Saturday challenged the House to vote on gun control before the
school year ends in June.
</P>
<P>
   ``No parent should have to fear sending a child to school,''
Clinton said in his weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
   From the first, Republicans tried to cast gun violence in
schools as primarily a cultural issue. ``When we stopped having
prayer in schools, things started to going to pot,'' Lott said
recently.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate Republicans were drawn into the gun debate
prematurely by their effort to stop Democratic attempts to stall a
bill protecting computer companies from lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   So when Democrats tried to graft gun control onto the computer
bill, Lott dusted off a juvenile-crime bill and presented it as a
vehicle for firearms restrictions instead.
</P>
<P>
   The leading role in countering the Democrats went to Craig. He
is chairman of the Senate Republican Policy Committee, which makes
him third in the Senate leadership, often playing point man.
</P>
<P>
   But symbolism is important _ particularly with the Democrats
casting the NRA as a villain. Sen. John Chafee, R-R.I., who is
aligned with the Democrats on this issue, said, ``I don't think it
was the best PR to have someone on the board of the NRA seen to be
leading the charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his consultations with the NRA, Craig said, ``This is not
something unique. Lobbyists are all over the Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with his expertise, Craig was caught off guard by the
Democrats. He said he was unaware, until days beforehand, that the
first measure Democrats would introduce was an amendment to mandate
checks on all buyers at gun shows.
</P>
<P>
   Craig said he had little time to formulate his alternative,
which created incentives _ but not requirements _ for voluntary
background checks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not much time to clarify and shape an issue and really
feel out your colleagues,'' Craig said. It would have helped, he
said, to have had ``another week of time to shape the issues and do
some effective polling of my own Senate membership.''
</P>
<P>
   As it was, the Democrats' initial requirement for background
checks was defeated, and Craig's initial amendment passed. But six
Republicans voted with the Democrats. And the next morning, after
Democrats pointedly noted that Craig's amendment also relaxed some
current gun laws and as headlines blared that Republicans had
defeated gun control, at least four Republican moderates panicked
over their vote with Craig.
</P>
<P>
   Craig was forced to introduce a new, stricter gun-show proposal,
and that retreat gave Democrats a potent oratorical wedge that
ultimately led, one week later on Thursday, to the passage of the
Democratic gun-show amendment, which had previously been defeated.
</P>
<P>
   James Jay Baker, the chief lobbyist for the rifle association,
said the Democratic proposal might not have succeeded if
Republicans had introduced Craig's second measure first.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly had to regroup,'' Baker said. ``The benefit of
hindsight is 20-20.''
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday, the day before a second vote on the Democratic
gun-show amendment, Republicans knew the tally was close.
</P>
<P>
   Of the six Republicans who had voted a week earlier for the
first Democratic amendment, which failed narrowly, Sen. John Warner
of Virginia was thought to be the most likely Republican to be
brought back into the fold.
</P>
<P>
   Both Craig and Lott talked with Warner on Wednesday evening.
Late Thursday morning, before the vote, Warner alone among the six
renegade Republicans was corralled again on the Senate floor by
Lott.
</P>
<P>
   But Warner again sided with Democrats. Several Republicans said
that was because Warner was still nursing a grudge against the
rifle association, which backed a Republican primary opponent
against him in his last Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Warner, however, said he was moved by his conscience and his
constituents. ``Women, primarily, are tugging at my sleeve in a
courteous way and saying, `Senator, I'm so worried about this,
isn't there something we can do?''' Warner said. ``And these are
not people who ordinarily tug at my sleeve.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Republican aide said that Republicans realized, hours
before the vote on Thursday on the resurrected Democratic gun-show
proposal, that it could end in a tie, handing Gore his moment. And
Republicans discussed throwing an extra vote to the Democrats, to
deny Gore that opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   But, the aide said, they felt the maneuver would be transparent
and would come back to haunt them.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after the vote, Lott tried to act unconcerned. ``So on
that issue I would call on the Democrats _ you've had your fun and
you've made your points,'' he said. ``We've made our points with
regard to violence in school. Now it's time to move on.''

THE KNICKS AND PHIL JACKSON HELD A SECRET MEETING NEARLY A MONTH
AGO  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ill.)   By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nearly a month ago, with the Knicks in disarray and
in danger of missing the playoffs for the first time in 12 years,
Dave Checketts, the president of Madison Square Garden, sensed
disastrous regression for the franchise. In secret, he met with
Phil Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Checketts and Jackson convened at an undisclosed location in the
New York metropolitan area and informally discussed team personnel
and the future of the Knicks, according to an official with a
National Basketball Association team and a second person with
knowledge of the meeting. Checketts made no offer to Jackson, but
the meeting represented the first inquiry into whether the coach of
the six-time champion Chicago Bulls would be interested in taking
over the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the informal get-together, Checketts dismissed Ernie
Grunfeld as team president and general manager, took over the
operation of the team and announced that Coach Jeff Van Gundy's
status would be reviewed at the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   However, the unexpected resurgence of the team _ making the
playoffs, defeating the reviled Miami Heat and Pat Riley in the
first round and winning the first two games of its Eastern
Conference semifinal series against Atlanta _ has put Checketts in
a perplexing situation.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks will seek their third straight victory against the
Hawks today at Madison Square Garden. A victory would catapult them
to a 3-0 lead in the four-of-seven-game series and put New York on
the verge of its first appearance in the Eastern Conference finals
since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Only a week ago, Van Gundy was in danger of losing his job;
seven days later there is speculation that he will end up with a
contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   Checketts denied through a Knicks spokesman that he has had
discussions with Jackson or any of his representatives. Jackson
could not be reached. His agent, Todd Musburger, also denied that a
discussion with Checketts had taken place, and refused to discuss
any and all teams that might be interested in Jackson, citing
strict confidentiality agreements between the respective parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are actively involved in sifting through some very
interesting situations,'' said Musburger. ``Phil has yet to make a
definite decision. But the process is moving forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, 53, who was part of two Knicks championship teams in
the 1970s and has recently had a home built in Woodstock, N.Y., has
kept a low profile while on sabbatical this season and has not said
for sure that he will return to coaching next season. According to
the NBA team official, Jackson has narrowed his consideration to
six teams. The two most serious contenders are the Los Angeles
Lakers and the Knicks, but no decision is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Other possibilities include the Nets. They, according to an
Eastern Conference team official who spoke on condition of
anonymity, met with Jackson on a flight in the past week. Though
Nets players have endorsed hiring Don Casey, who served as the
interim coach after John Calipari was fired on March 15, the owner
Lewis Katz is said to be interested in Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   According to the NBA team official, the meeting between
Checketts and Jackson lasted approximately 90 minutes and was also
attended by Musburger.
</P>
<P>
   One of the subjects that Jackson and Checketts discussed was
Patrick Ewing, the 14-year cornerstone of the franchise who is a
Van Gundy loyalist and has stated that he will not play for
Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shocks me,'' Ewing said last week after being asked what he
thought of the meeting between the two parties. ``I've said it, I'm
not playing for Phil Jackson. There's no way. They can trade me if
they get Phil.''
</P>
<P>
   Checketts and Jackson did not discuss the possibility of trading
Ewing if Jackson became the Knicks coach. He is owed $30 million
over the next two seasons and the possibility of acquiring a
marquee player in exchange for the 36-year-old, injury-plagued
center is slim; Checketts has said that he wants Ewing to finish
his career in New York, but he has also said that no player is
untradeable.
</P>
<P>
   The team official familiar with Jackson's meeting with Checketts
said Jackson emerged from it with the perception that the Knicks'
style of play would gradually shift its focus away from Ewing in
what many believe will be his final two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   That information would address Jackson's worst fears about
taking over the Knicks: that the team would continue to be
hamstrung by a predictable halfcourt offense with Ewing as its
focal point. Jackson favors the motion-oriented triangle offense he
employed in Chicago, where Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen and
another player were used interchangeably to create mismatches and
scoring opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy has one more year guaranteed on a three-year, $6
million contract. However, the contract gives the Knicks the option
of renewing Van Gundy for a fourth season at more than $3 million.
The contract also includes an incentive clause guaranteeing that
Van Gundy will be paid for a fourth season if the Knicks reach the
NBA finals either this season or next.
</P>
<P>
   Given the recent history of Garden management paying off former
coaches and overpaying less-than-star players, the money owed to
Van Gundy would not be an impediment to dismissing him. Now,
though, the team's postseason success may not only have saved Van
Gundy's job, it has also raised the possibility that the Knicks
could reward him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think, with the way they're going now, they would tear
up the old deal and give him a guaranteed two-year extension with a
third-year option with undisclosed terms,'' said an NBA agent who
requested anonymity. ``That way, all the speculation goes away and
everybody is happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy would not discuss his contract situation nor the
meeting between Jackson and Checketts and how that would affect his
future.
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy's agent, Rob Ades, said: ``I don't believe that the
Knicks would be interviewing another coach in light of the
performance of the team over the last several weeks. I just do not
believe they would do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ades added, ``Here is a guy who was in his office every single
day during the lockout, preparing for the season. He's loyal,
committed and he's done a great job for them. If he keeps it up,
you got the next Red Holzman.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy was in charge of a maddeningly inconsistent team that
had a 21-21 record with eight games left in the regular season. At
the same time he was trying to guide his team into the playoffs, he
was engaged in a bitter power struggle with Grunfeld.
</P>
<P>
   Grunfeld wanted Marcus Camby, for whom he had traded Charles
Oakley to Toronto and signed to a nearly $50 million contract, to
see more playing time and not languish on the bench. Van Gundy
opposed the unpopular trade, and was determined to make Camby _ who
had earned a reputation as a soft, unfocused player _ earn his
minutes in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Twice during the regular season, after blowout losses to Chicago
on March 12 and Charlotte on April 7, Grunfeld was apparently on
the verge of dismissing Van Gundy. Adding to their split, Van Gundy
began politicking as if he were a Garden executive instead of a
coaching lifer, intent on preserving his reputation instead of
merely coaching his team.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Checketts determined that the off-the-court
distraction was detrimental to the team's fortunes. He decided to
make a bold move, firing Grunfeld and assuming the team president
role for the first time in five years _ traveling with the team on
the road and being involved in its day-to-day operations.
</P>
<P>
   On April 26, Checketts watched the lightning rod for the Knicks'
resurrection _ an implausible second-half comeback from a 20-point
deficit against Miami. In the same arena three weeks later,
Checketts watched an even more improbable Knick victory.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Houston's running jump shot in the lane bounced off the
front of the rim, off the backboard and through the net with 0.8
seconds remaining to win a decisive Game 5 inside a stunned and
subdued Miami Arena _ the third job-saving victory in three months.
</P>
<P>
   In that game, Ewing _ playing on a throbbing Achilles' tendon,
two sore knees and a strained rib cage suffered in the third
quarter _ silenced his critics by playing one of the his most
courageous games. Scoring 22 points and hauling down 11 rebounds,
he outplayed Alonzo Mourning, who is a candidate for the league's
most valuable player award.
</P>
<P>
   If Van Gundy and Ewing were going out, they would go out
together.
</P>
<P>
   Since their meeting, Checketts has never got back to Jackson.

<P>
   SIACHEN GLACIER, in the western Himalayas _ For 15 blustery,
shivering years, the Indian and Pakistani armies have been fighting
a war along the frigid peaks of the western Himalayas _ in an area
named for the Siachen Glacier and known as the battleground on the
roof of the world.
</P>
<P>
   For a soldier, this is where hell freezes over, a 46-mile river
of slow-moving ice surrounded by stupendous towers of snow.
Temperatures swoon to 50 below, and sudden blizzards can bury field
artillery in minutes. Men sleep in ice caves or igloos and breathe
air so spare of oxygen that it sends their hearts into a mad
gallop. Fainting spells and pounding headaches are frequent.
Frostbite chews its way through digits and limbs.
</P>
<P>
   The enemy is hard to see in the crags and craters in the vast
whiteness _ and harder to hit. Rifles must be thawed repeatedly
over kerosene stoves, and machine guns need to be primed with
boiling water. At altitudes of 18,000 feet, mortar shells fly
unpredictable and extraordinary distances, swerving erratically
when met by sledgehammer gusts.
</P>
<P>
   While some troops fall to hostile fire, far more perish from
avalanches and missteps into crevasses that nature has camouflaged
with snow. This is especially the case in springtime, as the sun
licks away several feet of ice and opens new underground cracks and
seams.
</P>
<P>
   But for all these logistical peculiarities, the Siachen conflict
might be thought of as just another low-intensity border war _ were
it not being fought between the world's two newest nuclear powers.
Their combat over a barren, uninhabited nether world of
questionable strategic value is a forbidding symbol of their
lingering irreconcilability.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like a struggle of two bald men over a comb,'' said
Stephen P. Cohen, an authority on the Indian subcontinent at the
Brookings Institution. ``Siachen is the epitome of the worst
aspects of the relationship. These are two countries that are
paired on a road to Oslo or Hiroshima, and at this point they could
go either way.''
</P>
<P>
   Since gaining independence in 1947, Pakistan, which is
overwhelmingly Muslim, and India, which is predominantly Hindu,
have been enemies with a bent toward military confrontation. In
1949, after the first of three wars, the nations agreed to a
cease-fire line that unfortunately stopped short of the remote
massifs of north-central Kashmir _ a disputed area on the map where
India, Pakistan and China rub shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   The wording in the agreement merely said the line was to
continue ``north to the glaciers.'' For two decades, this vague
phrasing was of more concern to mapmakers than soldiers, but in the
1970s several groups of mountaineers in down outerwear began
trekking through the region. If they could survive the cold and
elevation, so might an army. Siachen became another reason for two
nervous neighbors to be reflexively suspicious.
</P>
<P>
   On April 13, 1984, the Indian army made a ``pre-emptive'' move
into the glacier and the peaks and passes around it. Within weeks,
Pakistani forces swept in to oppose them, but the Indians have been
able to hold on to the tactical advantage of the high ground.
</P>
<P>
   Most of India's many outposts are west of the glacier along the
Saltoro Range of the Karakoram Mountains. These pickets are
reachable to an enemy only after a strenuous climb and then a
frontal assault, a near-hopeless task in such thin air. After 50
strides, even a well-conditioned man is gasping for breath with his
muscles in a tremble.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years of refrigerated combat have brought only 15 years
of hardened stalemate. The Pakistanis cannot get up to the glacier;
the Indians cannot come down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody can win, no matter how long we fight,'' said Maj. Gen.
V.S. Budhwar, the Indian commander in Leh, whose region includes
Siachen. ``But this is our land. It is a portion of our
nation-state, and we will not cede it.''
</P>
<P>
   Occasionally, some vital strategic importance is assigned to the
Siachen area, with hypothetical aggressors flooding across mountain
highways. More often, the conflict is described as a simple matter
of principle. Imagine, people say, how America would respond if the
Russians overran even a small, barren chunk of Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   ``Siachen is an awful place where you can step on a thin layer
of snow and, poof, down you go 200 feet,'' said Gen. Khalid Mehmood
Arif, the retired former vice chief of Pakistan's military. ``But
no nation ever wants to lose a single inch of territory, so Siachen
has psychological and political importance. It's value is in ego
and prestige.''  &QL;

 SIACHEN GLACIER: and prestige.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arduous to live in, the Siachen area is beautiful to look at.
Some of the world's tallest mountains fill the landscape, their
snowy tops giving way to streams of white that glitter against the
black and purple rock. It is a moonscape of mesmerizing pinnacles
and ridges and drops. Ice formations rise a mile high. Clouds seem
at arm's reach.
</P>
<P>
   The Indian base camp is at the very start of the glacier, which
gently curves upward like a giant white tongue. Barracks, helipads,
supply sheds, satellite dishes, a hospital and Hindu shrines are
spread across several acres. It is clear the Indians have been here
awhile and are ready to stay. The command post is carpeted.
Curtains hang along the windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the heights,'' said Brig. P.C. Katoch, who runs the
operation. In contrast with the superior vista those heights
afford, he said, the Pakistani soldier sees nothing: ``He hears a
helicopter and shoots. He hears artillery and shoots. It's stupid.
He doesn't know where he's shooting.''
</P>
<P>
   But being king of the hill is costly. The Pakistanis can
resupply most of their posts by road and pack mule. At their
forward positions, some as high as 21,000 feet, the Indians must
rely on helicopters. The whirlybirds strain against the altitude
like oversized bumble bees. Many an air drop is swallowed by the
snow.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides deploy about 3,000 soldiers. The Pakistanis refuse to
divulge how much they spend in Siachen; the Indians estimate the
cost at $350,000 to $500,000 a day, said Lt. Gen. R.K. Sawhney, the
army's director general of military intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   Transporting kerosene is one major expense. Some Indian soldiers
live in igloos made of fiberglass panels. Six soldiers can sleep in
jigsaw configurations, crowded into a room the size of a king-sized
bed. Others live in ice tunnels gouged out with a pickax.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, small kerosene stoves are the hearths they huddle
around. The hissing competes with the howling of the wind. Black
smoke seems to color everything, including a man's spit.
</P>
<P>
   The highest perches are occupied by only a handful of soldiers,
and sleeping is rarely done at night, for this is the most likely
time for the enemy to sneak up. Sentry duty is bleak work. Hot
water bottles do not stay hot for long. A relay must be set up to
exchange frozen rifles for defrosted ones.
</P>
<P>
   During storms, the heavy snowfall seems as thick as long, white
drapery. The wind does pinwheels, and the basics of a hard life
gets that much harder. ``At my post, you have to use a crawl trench
to get to the toilet,'' said Cpl. Joginder Singh. ``When it snows,
the trench fills up and you have to stand. The enemy can see you
and that's how you die.''
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult to know how many men have been killed. Some
local news reports put casualty totals for both sides in the
thousands, but this seems based on conjecture. The Pakistanis do
not release such details, and the Indians say they have lost only
the 616 soldiers whose names appear on a stone memorial at the base
camp.
</P>
<P>
   The inscription reads: ``Quartered in snow, silent to remain.
When the bugle calls, they shall rise and march again.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since they were separated at birth, India and Pakistan have
fought over the territory of Jammu and Kashmir, a stunningly lush
area that touches both of their borders.
</P>
<P>
   In the complicated and emotional give-and-take that accompanied
partition in 1947, Kashmir, a state with a large Muslim majority,
ended up within India. To Pakistan, this seemed unreasonable. The
infant nations were drawn into combat.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Kashmir is the issue that most heats the blood. The
Indians claim the area while the Pakistanis argue that the
Kashmiris must decide their own future through a plebiscite. Both
countries maintain formidable armies near the cease-fire line that
splits the territory in two. The killing may slow but it never
stops.
</P>
<P>
   Ownership of the mountainous and sparsely-populated northeast is
a particular conundrum. From the Indian point of view, the language
of the 1949 agreement is eminently clear: ``north to the glaciers''
means a line going slightly northwest along the natural watershed
of the Saltoro peaks. The Pakistanis are equally sure: the phrasing
intends for the line to continue northeasterly as it does through
the rest of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
   ``The roots of the Kashmir problem are very tangled, but as far
as the glacier goes, this is simply a matter of Pakistanis sneaking
their way into a place that doesn't belong to them,'' said India's
Lt. Gen. M.L. Chibber, retired, who is central to the Siachen saga.
</P>
<P>
   An amiable man who left the army in 1985, Chibber now follows
guru Sai Baba and speaks easily about the futility of war. In 1978,
however, he was a commander with responsibility for Siachen. He was
alarmed to learn that the Pakistanis were accompanying mountaineers
to the glacier. Just as troubling were maps printed in the West.
They showed Siachen as part of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   By the early '80s, both armies were sending expeditions into the
area, and suspicions accumulated like fresh snow. In late 1983, the
Indians became convinced the Pakistanis were about to seize the
glacier, Chibber said. This was inferred from intercepted
communiques.
</P>
<P>
   If further evidence was needed, he said, it came when India sent
procurers to Europe to buy cold weather gear. They ran into
Pakistanis doing the same shopping.
</P>
<P>
   India's ``pre-emptive'' takeover of Siachen was called Operation
Meghdoot after the divine cloud messenger in a Sanskrit play. It
soon came to seem a burdensome success. Like overeager chess
players, the Indians had failed to plan several moves ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one had ever carried out military operations at these
altitudes and temperatures, so we figured after the summer ended,
we'd have to pull out,'' Chibber said. ``But with the first snows,
we realized it was possible to stay up there all winter. If we
left, the Pakistanis would take the glacier, and then we'd never
get it back.''

 SIACHEN GLACIER: it back.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the conflict's first years, with the armies inexperienced at
such a cold war, the number of casualties mounted quickly. Valiant,
if foolhardy, assaults were attempted. Frostbite, snow blindness
and pulmonary and cerebral edema took a huge toll.
</P>
<P>
   Daring raids are now rare, the Pakistanis say, though the
Indians often boast of victorious defensive skirmishes, killing
three here and a dozen there. Each side makes claims the other
vigorously denies.
</P>
<P>
   These days, the blasts of artillery and mortar shells are the
war's steady cadence. ``We fire at them and they fire at us, but
this is not a place where the usual calculations of trajectory and
distance apply,'' said Capt. Hamid Mukhtar, a Pakistani artillery
officer.
</P>
<P>
   Mukhtar was serving at a forward post at 18,000 feet, near a
ridge line known as the Conway Saddle. ``There are crevasses on
either side of these paths,'' he cautioned as he walked. ``Step
into the wrong place and you will go to meet God beneath the
snow.''
</P>
<P>
   Daily patrolling is necessary, if for no other reason than to
tread on a marked trail so it will not disappear. In February, in a
typical catastrophe, an avalanche crushed 13 Pakistani soldiers
tethered together with rope. A single survivor led the search that
later recovered the pristine dead, their bodies preserved as if
locked in cold storage.
</P>
<P>
   Melting leads to snow slides. The noontime temperature in early
spring was 10 below, but the sun was bright enough to rapidly turn
an exposed nose the color of a radish. Sweat is a problem because
it becomes ice in a soldier's gloves and socks. Frostbite is then
quick with its work.
</P>
<P>
   Even after a day's exertion, most soldiers have little appetite
at these heights. Rations come out of tin cans. Fresh produce is
rare. An orange freezes to the hardness of a baseball; a potato
cannot be dented with a hammer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the hardships, both sides report an oversupply of
volunteers. Stints in Siachen usually last three months or less.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my country's soil, and whether something grows here or
not, I would gladly die to protect it,'' said Cpl. Mohammad
Shafique, a Pakistani.
</P>
<P>
   Few soldiers know much about the other side's territorial
claims, but they seem untroubled by doubt of the enemy's murderous
skulduggery. While many people in India and Pakistan hope for
rapprochement, others merely heap fresh animosity upon the old.
Evil is presumed.
</P>
<P>
   Budhwar, the Indian regional commander, said Pakistanis suffer
from a ``deformed growth,'' becoming brainwashed in school ``with
all the dos and don'ts'' of Islamic fundamentalism. ``Their very
existence depends on being inimical to India,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of his counterparts is Brig. Nusrat Khan Sial, who commands
Pakistan's Siachen operation from the city of Skardu. He called the
Indians ``cowards'' whose Hindu beliefs lack reverence for human
life. He said he suspects they have used chemical weapons in
Siachen, which the Indians vehemently deny.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be the Indians, not us, who will trigger this
situation up to the level where both sides resort to nuclear
weapons,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, both nations tested ballistic missiles as they
develop enough tit-for-tat firepower to give an adversary pause.
Following the example of superpowers, they are pursuing peace
through nuclear deterrence, their leaders say: Smaller disputes are
less likely to provoke all-out wars when the possible outcome
includes annihilation.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a less costly path toward peace is being
undertaken. Earlier this year, with brass bands and polite
embraces, India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, made a
heralded bus trip to Pakistan and met with Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif.
</P>
<P>
   More talks are in the offing, but optimism is in irregular
supply.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Siachen itself has been the subject of seven
``major rounds of talks,'' said Robert G. Wirsing, a scholar at the
University of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Under various governments ruled by various parties, negotiators
have agreed that the conflict is futile _ and some have even called
it lunatic. But one side or the other always has been too afraid of
a double cross to complete a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic politics are also a hitch. Any compromise involving
Kashmir looms like a lit fuse, especially to unstable governments.
</P>
<P>
   So the two armies fight on, proud of conquering the elements if
not each other. Their doctors have become experts at high-altitude
medicine, their helicopter pilots adroit at skirting the cliffs.
Solar panels are affixed to some igloos.
</P>
<P>
   On the Indian side, a kerosene pipeline is being completed. A
ski lift will ferry soldiers across the canyons. A pulley system
has begun to hoist supplies up the mountainsides. Bacteria are
eating human waste in machines called biodigesters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have become specialists at high-altitude fighting _
probably the best in the world,'' boasted Sawhney, sounding as
self-congratulatory as his Pakistani counterparts. ``We can
tolerate the harsh elements. We have made livable conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   We are prepared, both sides say, to battle on the roof of the
world forever.

SPORTS COLUMN: YOGI JOINS FAMOUS FOES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE FALLS, N.J. _ Up on the screen in grainy black-and-white
film, the New York Yankees were playing the Brooklyn Dodgers in
their six World Series from 1947 to 1956 and every so often Yogi
Berra would appear, swinging a bat or in his catcher's mask. And
now, in the Yogi Berra Museum's theater, Lawrence Peter Berra
himself stood up Friday for his induction into, of all things, the
Brooklyn Dodger Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``They weren't easy,'' he was saying, alluding to those Dodger
teams. ``They were a real good ball club.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind him, Joe Pignatano, a former Mets coach and once a Dodger
catcher, interrupted, saying with a smile, ``You still know how to
lie.'' Yogi never blinked.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had a real good ball club,'' Yogi said firmly. ``We just
beat 'em, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   Beat 'em in five of those six World Series, and more often than
not, Yogi Berra was in the middle of what was going on. He caught
Don Larsen's perfect game in 1956 and over those six Series, he hit
eight homers and knocked in 21 runs with a .298 average, including
three homers and 10 runs batted in in 1956, the last series in
Ebbets Field.
</P>
<P>
   Along with dozens of familiar Brooklyn Dodgers, this Yankee folk
hero is now in perhaps the only pantheon to also honor famous foes.
Bobby Thomson is in it. So is Stan Musial, Ralph Kiner, Johnny
Vander Meer, Warren Spahn, Johnny Sain, Robin Roberts, Curt Simmons
and two other Yankees _ Tommy Henrich and Johnny Kucks.
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody remembers Johnny Kucks, but anybody who was in
Brooklyn in 1956 remembers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The seventh game, we didn't know who was going to pitch,''
Berra said. ``Kucks didn't know. I didn't know. But Frank Crossetti
put a ball on the chair at his locker in Ebbets Field. That's how
how Casey Stengel told a pitcher he was pitching. He had his third
base coach put a ball on his chair.''
</P>
<P>
   Kucks, a sinkerball right-hander with an 18-9 record who had
worked twice in relief in that Series, pitched a 9-0 six-hitter
supported by Berra's pair of two-run homers off Don Newcombe, the
Dodger ace with a 27-7 record that season. Berra also hit a grand
slam off Newcombe in the second game of that series.
</P>
<P>
   ``On those two homers in the seventh game, Newk threw two good
pitches _ one away, one in,'' Berra recalled. ``I just saw the ball
good. Before one of 'em, Roy Campanella didn't hold a foul tip that
would have been a third strike.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, when the Dodgers won their only World Series
representing Brooklyn, Jackie Robinson stole home in the opener at
Yankee Stadium with Whitey Ford pitching and Frank Kellert at bat.
When American League umpire Bill Summers ruled Robinson safe, Berra
hopped around in protest.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was out,'' Berra was saying now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Out by how much?'' a listener asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was out,'' Berra repeated. ``Out.''
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth inning of that Series' seventh game, with the
Dodgers leading, 2-0, Billy Martin on second and Gil McDougald on
first, left-hander Johnny Podres threw a high outside pitch. Berra
swung and lifted a short fly ball down the left-field line. ``If
Amoros wasn't there, it's a hit'' Berra said. ``Amoros was fast. He
ran a long ways.''
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Amoros was also left-handed. He stuck out his glove,
caught the ball on the run, then threw to shortstop Pee Wee Reese,
who threw to first baseman Gil Hodges to double up McDougald.``Pee
Wee had looked back,'' Podres said, ``and knew where everybody
was.''
</P>
<P>
   Podres was there Friday along with fellow Hall of Fame members
Ralph Branca, Clem Labine, Roger Craig and Pignatano, as well as
this year's other inductees _ right-hander Jim Hughes, outfielders
Don Thompson and Don Demeter and bat boy Angelo Ambrosio. Of that
group the noisiest applause from about 200 spectators was for
Podres, whose eight-hit shutout in 1955 set off a celebration in
Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``We let 'em win that year,'' Berra said with a smile. This was
baseball's version of the Mountain coming to Mohammed. For the
occasion, the Brooklyn Dodger Hall of Fame, housed in the Brooklyn
Historical Society building in Brooklyn Heights, came to Yogi's
museum here on the Montclair State College campus not far from his
Montclair home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't know,'' Yogi said, ``that the Dodgers wanted
to sign me.''
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in St. Louis as an outfielder and third baseman,
Berra was scouted by the Cardinals, but their general manager,
Branch Rickey, downplayed Berra's potential. ``Rickey told me I'd
never be a big league ballplayer,'' Berra recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Rickey, however, was about to desert the Cardinals to become the
Brooklyn Dodgers president. He was hoping to sign Berra as a Dodger
farmhand. But in 1943 the Yankees signed Berra.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I signed with the Yankees,'' Berra said, ``I got a
telegram from Rickey to join the Dodgers in spring training.'' By
the 1947 Series, Berra was the Yankees rookie catcher as
right-hander Floyd ``Bill'' Bevens, leading 2-1, went into the
ninth inning of the fourth game with a no-hitter. With two out, Al
Gionfriddo, running or Carl Furillo, tried to steal second.
</P>
<P>
   ``I threw high,'' Berra remembered. ``With a good throw, maybe
Bevens gets his no-hitter, but I was a terrible catcher then.''
</P>
<P>
   Gionfriddo was safe. Pete Reiser walked; Eddie Miksis ran for
him. Harry ``Cookie'' Lavagetto broke up the no-hitter with a
double off the right-field wall as Gionfriddo and Miksis scored.
The Dodgers won, 3-2, but the Yankees won that Series in seven
games.
</P>
<P>
   But what if the Dodgers had signed Lawrence Peter Berra?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Dodgers instead of the Yankees would have won five of
those six World Series from 1947 to 1956. And When Roy Campanella
arrived in 1948 as the Dodgers catcher, who would have been moved
to another position, probably left field?
</P>
<P>
   ``Me,'' Yogi Berra said. ``I was a terrible catcher then.''

SELES TRIES TO RECAPTURE MAGIC AT FRENCH OPEN 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A survivalist in sneakers, Monica Seles has come full
circle after five years lost to calamities beyond her control. She
has arrived at the French Open, which she monopolized from 1990 to
1992 and where she improbably resurfaced as last year's runner-up
three weeks after her father's death.
</P>
<P>
   She is determined to use the next few years to retool herself
and her game _ before the game, with its streamlined teen-age
contingent, passes her by.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to have five years where no outside things come in
and take over, and where I can see my full potential,'' Seles said
recently, undeterred that her training for the French, which begins
Monday, was interrupted by bronchitis. After all, her 1998
preparation was nonexistent, and look what transpired.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I want to win at any cost, and I don't want that
kind of people around me,'' said Seles, coachless since dismissing
Gavin Hopper last November. ``But there are a few more things I
want to achieve before I'm done, and one of them is going back to
playing the fearless tennis I used to play.''
</P>
<P>
   In a fearful world, one where she has had her confidence eroded
by every reality check from an on-court stabbing to the loss of her
father, to the current NATO bombings of Novi Sad, Yugoslavia, her
Balkan birthplace, Seles has decided to overcome instead of buckle
under. When she was the fiercest and youngest No. 1 to raise a
racquet, Seles wore rarefied success like a coat-of-arms.
</P>
<P>
   Now her daily demons include melancholy and binge-eating and a
homesickness all the more acute because it hurts to go home. But
she means to conquer them before they spoil what's left of her
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are major issues I've been dealing with for the past
five years; we're not talking about crying over lost luggage at the
airport,'' Seles, 25, said. ``They're not my fault, and I'm not
causing them, but they're hard to get over. I'd have to be a robot
to lose someone as key as my dad and go on like nothing has
happened. I really miss his advice. On the road, I feel pretty
alone without him.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now there's this thing in Yugoslavia,'' she said. ``I see
images from my childhood, bridges where I used to run as a kid
being blown up. You're hoping that it isn't your generation that
starts World War III. You're hoping somebody learns from what's
gone wrong in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Seles has.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, when she took a miserable bow to Arantxa Sanchez
Vicario in the final at Roland Garros, Seles couldn't help
believing she was destined to be a perennial victim of
circumstance, of adversity that started with the stab in the back
that cost her the top ranking in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that was the first time she was forced to look outside
her life, which was kind of storybook, and notice that there was a
whole other world out there and some of it was bad,'' said Betsy
Nagelsen, a former player who, with her husband, Mark McCormack,
founder of the International Management Group, is a Seles mentor.
``Then just when she was getting back on track, she lost her dad. I
don't think she felt she could go on with her tennis when she
wasn't sure who or what she was playing for.''
</P>
<P>
   Seles was summoned home from the 1998 Italian Open when Karolj
Seles lapsed into what turned out to be a final coma. After his
death, she retreated to her bedroom and refused to venture out
until her mother, Ester, hoping tennis would be a tonic, persuaded
her to return to Europe and play the 1998 French Open as Seles and
her father planned.
</P>
<P>
   Seles' sentimental odyssey lasted all the way to the final, but
instead of looking back on her run as a sort of miracle, she
berates herself for taking an unprofessional attitude into the
match. Had she won it, she would have earned her 10th Grand Slam
title.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it didn't matter to me whether I won or lost, and you
can't not care in a Grand Slam final,'' she said. ``I was just
playing to play. I wasn't ready to fight. That chapter is closed.''
</P>
<P>
   Seles played through the rest of 1998 but didn't like what she
saw when she looked in the mirror at the start of 1999. ``In the
top 50 on the women's tour, you don't see anybody else in the shape
I'm in,'' she said. ``I'm not embarrassed to admit that.''
Especially not now that she has decided to shed the weight that has
crept onto her 5-foot-10-inch frame since 1993, when she quit
tennis for 27 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it emotional eating,'' she said of her tendency to
nibble the nearest edible in stressful moments. ``Some people
drink, some smoke, some take pills, and I eat; it calms me down.
For the past seven years, you could tell by my weight how I was
doing emotionally.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides providing a glimpse of her disheveled emotional state,
the extra pounds acted like unwanted ballast on the tennis court.
``Back when I was No. 1 I was moving so quick, getting to every
ball,'' she said. ``And catching the ball early is really the basis
of my game. If you hit me 30 balls, I'd hit you 31. But lately I'd
be out there thinking, `I've got to finish this point in three
balls or I'm gonna be dead.'''
</P>
<P>
   It was fearful tennis, and she was tired of playing that way.
</P>
<P>
   This spring Seles hired Markus Kittler, a trainer and bodyguard,
to whittle her into shape with a steady diet of weight-training,
cardiovascular work, mealtime moderation and hectic sessions on the
Stairmaster.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Seles captured her first title in seven months, and
her first on clay since the 1992 French Open, at the Bausch and
Lomb Championships, and a week later she improved her Fed Cup
singles record to 10-0 while helping the United States sweep
Croatia. Her progress, and new platform on fitness, were not lost
on Billie Jean King, the Fed Cup captain.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's still got what she always had, her trademark, being
great off both wings with incredible accuracy, but if she will just
get in the best shape of her life physically, I think she can win
anything this year,'' King predicted. ``She can be No. 1 in the
world again whenever she wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Iva Majoli, the 1997 French Open champion, counts Seles as a
favorite in 1999. ``Actually, I thought last year Monica was going
to win it for sure,'' Majoli said. ``She can still hurt everybody
when she's playing good, and she's still at the top of the women's
game.''
</P>
<P>
   After watching Lindsay Davenport make a fitness commitment that
paid off last year in a U.S. Open title and the top ranking, Seles
is intrigued by the possibility she can do it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for her right now, getting back to her best tennis is
a case of `I've got to lose 30 pounds and hit a thousand balls,'''
Nagelsen said. ``She's not interested in listening to a sports
psychologist, not interested in trying to replace her father. But
here she is, No. 3 in the world and not even close to peaking:
that's the most incredible part.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bounding down Upper New York Bay under a soft May sun
on Friday, New York Harbor alive with pleasure boats, ferries and
tankers, it seemed a far better day for sightseeing than
competitively chasing stripers. But at 3 p.m., Manhattan's first
major striped bass fishing tournament had officially begun with a
horn blast at Chelsea Piers. The first annual Manhattan Cup, a
two-day event designed to focus attention on the wealth of stripers
that exists today in the Hudson River and New York Harbor, was
under way.
</P>
<P>
   At that moment, 22 boats, mostly run by charter captains,
dispersed all over New York Harbor to play their hunches as to
where they might find stripers under classic wrong conditions: It
was too pleasant for a fish notorious for cooperating best when the
weather is worst.
</P>
<P>
   The Manhattan Cup, a fund-raiser, was sponsored by the city's
chapter of the Coastal Conservation Association, a national
environmental group dedicated to preserving marine resources. By
7:30 p.m. Saturday, prizes were awarded for the largest striped
bass taken by fly fishing, lure fishing and bait fishing.
</P>
<P>
   The first Manhattan Cup didn't have the trappings of
commercialism associated with the freshwater black bass tournament
circuit, with its decal-laden, jumpsuited pros and large cash
prizes. This event was sweeter _ more a collection of city types
smitten by striper fishing.
</P>
<P>
   I was on board with an old friend, Captain Joe Shastay, and his
anglers, three stock traders: Brad Berk, Mike Cannizaro and Joe
Seminara. More than a decade ago, Captain Joe, as he is often
called, sensed the unrealized potential of guided sport fishing in
New York Harbor for stripers, bluefish and weakfish.
</P>
<P>
   Now in his ninth professional year, Shastay has seen bluefish
catches in the harbor go down, as they have along the rest of the
coast, but increased numbers of striped bass and weakfish have more
than compensated.
</P>
<P>
   Shastay stopped the boat near Bay Ridge in Brooklyn and anchored
over a small ledge. Brad and Mike wanted to compete in the
fly-fishing category, but fishing a wispy bundle of hair and
feathers is not easily done in a deep and murky harbor. Shastay has
developed an unnamed fly meant to resemble a diamond jig, perhaps
the premier deep-water lure. Ten inches long, sparkly, and with
large lead eyes, it is impossible to cast, but twitched deep in a
current, it is a fine, if not a definition-broadening solution to
harbor fly fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Although a nearby troller landed a husky striper, we went
fishless there and so Shastay headed up the East River. The first
stop was against the sea wall along the FDR Drive, where he
instructed the group to cast under a moored barge where ``last year
one of my fly fishermen hooked a striper so large it emptied his
reel.'' The fish ignored us here, too, but not the passersby _ it
was entertaining to watch the pedestrians and rollerbladers do
double takes when they looked down and saw us. A small gallery
formed. One woman with a baby stroller couldn't believe we were
simply fishing and asked if we were scientists searching for life
in the East River.
</P>
<P>
   Next, we tried an attractively fishy-looking field of rotting
pilings on the Brooklyn side of the river. Shastay relayed precise
instructions based on his years of experience: ``Cast five feet to
the left of the two shortest timbers and let the lure sink for 17
to 20 seconds.'' But no fish struck in the still sunny shallows.
</P>
<P>
   With time getting short before the first day's 7:30 p.m. finish,
we motored to some deep reefs in the East River near the Water Club
at 30th Street.
</P>
<P>
   We cruised around trying to located stripers with the electronic
fish finder while watching seaplanes take off and land around us,
busy on this Friday evening taking passengers to vacation homes
along far more pristine shores. Shastay marked a few fish on his
machine and our hopes were raised.
</P>
<P>
   Brad and Mike continued to ``fly fish,'' but Joe Seminara, the
realist of our group, put on a live eel. Quickly, he hooked a large
fish, but it soon came off. The tooth marks on the eel bait
indicated bluefish. This happened several more times _ a hard hit _
a 10- or 20-second fight before the blue sensed something was not
right _ and then he would reel up a wounded eel.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, though, Seminara had a strike and the fish stayed on.
Obviously large, it waged a strong battle complicated by an urban
touch, a plastic bag that became entangled in the line. Eventually
the bag fell off, the fish came to starboard, and Shastay leaned
over the gunwale, net in hand. After much splashing and grunting,
he hoisted a 17-pound blue _ admired, photographed and released to
fight again. Not a striper, and so, not a legitimate cup entry, but
a fine example of the riches of a healthy harbor and in keeping
with the spirit of the first Manhattan Cup.

NATO MISTAKENLY HITS REBEL BASE, KILLING SEVEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ NATO aircraft mistakenly bombed a key base
that had been seized by the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army six weeks
ago, allied spokesman said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel fighters use the base to funnel supplies and troops deep
inside Kosovo. It is situated at Kosare, a mountain town in Kosovo
about six miles from the Albanian border.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO did not know that the base was under the control of the
Kosovo Liberation Army, even though it has often been featured in
reports by the international press, including television broadcasts
and still photographs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The target which was struck by NATO was done so on the
assumption that it was still in the hands of the Yugoslav army,''
said Jamie Shea, the NATO spokesman. ``And subsequently it appears
to have been taken over by the KLA.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Liberation Army said seven fighters had been killed
and 25 wounded in the attack, which took place on Friday morning.
The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has
monitors in the region, said at least one rebel fighter had been
killed and 15 wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The bombing of Kosare was the latest in a series of intelligence
errors that have embarrassed allied war planners. The mistaken
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade, Yugoslavia, on May 7,
the result of bad intelligence work by the CIA, sparked angry
protests in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   More controversy over NATO's targeting flared on Friday when
Belgrade charged that NATO had bombed a prison near Istok. Serbian
officials said 19 inmates and guards, including Kosovo Albanians,
had been killed in the raid.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesmen said Saturday that 20 allied planes had targeted
a major military command post and staging area near the prison.
They said the alliance had not intended to hit the prison and was
still not certain that it had done so. Allied officers are still
examining videotapes from the strike planes.
</P>
<P>
   The prison has been cited in international reports on human
rights abuses as a Serbian police center for the torture and
interrogation of rebels and other Kosovo Albanians deemed
dissidents by the authorities. NATO spokesmen acknowledged that
allied planners had assumed that the prison was empty at the time
it was struck.
</P>
<P>
   The errors have occurred as NATO has stepped up its aircraft
raids and reported notable success. On Friday the alliance flew 648
missions, of which 245 were bombing attacks.
</P>
<P>
   NATO said it had struck at least 12 tanks, 11 armored vehicles,
nine artillery positions and at least seven other vehicles. It also
hit electrical transformers, among other targets.
</P>
<P>
   The Friday attack on Kosare threw a spotlight on the
relationship between NATO and the Kosovo Liberation Army.
Officially, they do not fight together. But military officials say
rebel troops in Kosovo often provide information on Serbian
positions, which enables NATO to bomb them.
</P>
<P>
   Allied spokesmen have also cited the rebels' persistence in the
field, as an indication that the Yugoslav military is weakening.
Allied intelligence officials estimate that there are between 6,000
and 10,000 rebel fighters in Kosovo and approximately an equal
number in camps in Albania.
</P>
<P>
   They are lightly armed with rifles and anti-tank weapons, but
still have the ability to harass Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   Because the rebels want NATO to keep bombing, they have not
complained publicly about the attack at the Kosare base. NATO did
not volunteer any information on the strike either, until
questioned about the incident at its press briefing Saturday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even so, NATO's information was sketchy. Shea did not explain
how the Kosare base, which has been in rebel hands for more than a
month, became a NATO target.
</P>
<P>
   He described it as a ``a border command post that was until very
recently in the hands of the Yugoslav army.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had known, in a very dynamic situation _ particularly
where the KLA is extremely active in that part _ that it had been
captured by the KLA, then it would have been taken off the target
list,'' Shea said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO warplanes have often bombed Serbian border posts, which the
alliance says the Serbs have sometimes used to hide ammunition and
fuel.
</P>
<P>
   The border posts are relatively easy to attack, particularly
when bad weather or target identification problems have prevented
allied planes from hitting more difficult targets, like Serbian
troops and armor.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the Kosovo-Albania border has been the scene of
intense fighting. The rebels have been infiltrating men and
materiel through seven mountain bases and the Serbs have been
trying to seal the border.

SPORTS COLUMN: THE ENTANGLED WEB AROUND YOUTH SPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT LIPSYTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Jocks are here to stay,'' wrote a retired English teacher
whose cyberspace handle is Tonya177. ``Kids need the instant
feedback of win-lose. Academics' promise is far in the future,
contingent on luck and developing talent. A game is won or lost _
now.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bascinet1 disagreed: ``The jock culture is bad enough, but
to have it perpetuated in the halls of educational institutions is
completely obscene. To those who say, `There are winners and
losers; that's the way it is'; were you raised by wolves?''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two weeks, in a thoughtful and spirited debate on
The New York Times on the Web Forums, fans and nonfans have been
wrestling with the values _ positive and negative _ of American
sports.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Jock culture is all about instilling overly competitive,
glory-seeking values,'' wrote Mordox. ``A lot of former jocks will
tell you that participating in team sports teaches instead the
values of teamwork, dedication, and so on, which is true to the
extent that jocks will back each other up when one of them is
picking on an unpopular kid. But what about `teamwork' when the
`opponent' is not on the same `team'? Or if some kid doesn't have
the `skills,' or doesn't want to wear the `uniform' to join the
`team'?''
</P>
<P>
   But we need jocks, maintained another poster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Desmosthenes and the Gipper both emphasized tenacity of
purpose, dedication and selflessness for the common good,'' wrote
Jamesrice9. ``Students learn as much on the football field as in a
seminar on the classics. The resistance of all civilized nations to
the aggressors in World War II came partly from the cricket fields
in England and the gridirons in the States.''
</P>
<P>
   Jock culture flared as a hot topic a few weeks ago, in the wake
of the shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. The
teen-aged killers were quoted as shouting: ``All jocks stand up.
We're going to kill every one of you.'' Some commentators
interpreted this as the ultimate pathological response of outsiders
to a world from which they had been excluded by swaggering,
privileged athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, this was just before the showing of an ABC
television movie, ``Our Guys,'' about the 1989 sexual assault on a
mildly retarded teen-ager by members of the Glen Ridge, N.J.,
football team. In the book on which the movie was based, Bernard
Lefkowitz described the smug community that doted on its golden
boys, lived through them, protected them and ultimately placed too
great a burden on them.
</P>
<P>
   Blaming sports for violence _ even post-game fan violence _
seems as shallow as pulling one thread out of the American tapestry
and declaring it the signifier. But there is no question that jock
culture haunts our national daydreams; while sports is no longer
our default moral crucible and definer of manhood, it is still a
powerful force in adolescence and a spreading influence in popular
entertainment. A previous column calling for comments, perhaps even
answers to questions about sports' role was reprinted on the Web
(www.nytimes.com/forums), and continues to draw a large and
energetic response.
</P>
<P>
   Posters on the website have raised issues of race, class and
gender. Chrismctae wrote: ``Jock is the male backlash against
feminism. The media backlash against thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   But the dominant theme has been the significance of high school
sports on the psyches of adolescents, jocks and nonjocks alike.
</P>
<P>
   One of the earliest postings was from Vhart3, a former high
school athletic trainer who wrote: ``Bad behavior with jocks
usually begins the first time an adult makes an exception to the
rule because of a student's athletic ability. I observed things
such as grades being changed, school disciplinary policy waived and
teachers virtually run out of their jobs because they would not
coddle a star athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   Barney8bc, a teacher for more than 20 years, mostly in
``self-satisfied suburbs,'' quickly added: ``Much of the problem
lies in the hypocritical disconnect that students perceive between
the stated goals of secondary schools and the subtext. The subtext,
of course, is that sports are all important. The travel budget for
extracurricular activities was greater than the instructional
budget for the district. The kids knew it, and saw adults `buying
in' to the hokum.''
</P>
<P>
   While agreeing with those posters who maintained that ``sports
can and do have a positive role in the lives of young people,''
Jtomon could not justify linking sports and schools. ``The ethics
of sports and the ethics of education directly contradict one
another and as much as anything that conflict is the cause of the
Littleton tragedy. You cannot have a high-school administration
that openly condones an ethic of competitive glory-seeking
conquerors without also creating an underclass of noncompetitive
`Losers.'''
</P>
<P>
   As a self-described skinny, 6-foot-4-inch bespectacled
eighth-grader, Sigep-al ``felt a real sense of helplessness and
worthlessness.'' But by lifting weights and wearing contact lenses,
he made his high school football team and turned his social life
around. He wrote: ``I liked it, but I did not like the denigration
of `nerds' and `dorks' by those with whom I was now friendly to
which I had previously been subjected. There will always be the
haves and the have-nots, it is simply a phenomenon of human
culture.`
</P>
<P>
   Ethan Mark, who described himself as an American male in his 30s
who grew up in Princeton, N.J., and has been living in the
Netherlands for the past few years, sees his native country as
lacking social structure and identity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faced with this fundamental insecurity about who they are,''
wrote Mark, ``Americans, and youth in particular, grab hold of
gender roles as one answer, with sports as an essential defining
element of what it is to be ``male.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports and one's ability to participate in them become an
essential determinant of one's social place and identity. Seen in
this way, sports becomes a very serious business indeed _ and it is
not necessarily surprising, if no less alarming, that one's failure
to live up to the sports ideal can generate tremendous frustration
and insecurity.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Mark's hypothesis, Anaximander2 took issue with
``its implication that the troublemakers in schools will tend to be
those who fail to live up to the jock ideal. Most of us have
probably experienced the opposite: there often seems to be a
mysterious connection between booze, rampant sex, petty crime and
the ability to throw a ball. For every Ted Kaczynski in the world
there is a Darryl Strawberry, a Dennis Rodman, an O.J. Simpson, and
many others.''
</P>
<P>
   There were those who took issue with the very existence of the
forum. Rsawyer3 posted this: ```Jock Culture' this week, the
`Opportunism of Journalists' next week.'' Utokia wrote: ``Whoever
came up with `jock culture haunts our national daydreams' must have
been a pencil-necked, sand-eating loser! Get real!''
</P>
<P>
   But Mckman1 rallied the pencil-necks, writing: ``Take heart, all
you others who are nonjocks or affiliated in their false and
temporal society. The whole school may call you nerds and freaks
now, but it is people like you who will eat at diners manned and
staffed by these buffoons one fine day.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will one day make decisions, invent things and come up
with ideas the likes of which not even a jock on steroids can dream
of in his Gatorade-filled sleep.''

HIRING WANNSTEDT LIFTS JOHNSON'S SPIRITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the tumult of January, when Jimmy Johnson's mother died and
he quit as head coach of the Miami Dolphins and then, in a flash,
returned, Johnson called a friend: Dave Wannstedt.
</P>
<P>
   Wannstedt was there to listen to Johnson the way Johnson had
been there to listen to Wannstedt during his six years of angst as
the Chicago Bears' head coach. The two have been doing this for the
last 23 years, since they met as assistant coaches at the
University of Pittsburgh. It was two years together there, four at
Oklahoma State, three at the University of Miami and then four more
with the Dallas Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   A few months ago, Johnson felt frazzled and disillusioned and
ready to leave behind an unfinished work in Miami. But then the two
friends brainstormed and stroked each other, and in a blink,
Wannstedt, dismissed in Chicago, was on his way to Miami as the
Dolphins' assistant head coach. Johnson and Wannstedt, reunited one
more time.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was asked at the National Football League's annual
meeting recently about his relationship with Wannstedt and what his
addition meant to Johnson and to the Dolphins. Speaking softly and
emotionally, he talked about friendship and comfort levels and how
he had his ``guy'' back. He said Wannstedt would tell him when he
was wrong more readily than his other coaches would. He had back
his jogging partner, and someone to whom, on occasion, he could
comfortably entrust the entire Dolphins organization.
</P>
<P>
   This is Johnson's fourth season in Miami, and this one is
different. Wannstedt is there. And Johnson believes this is his
most talented team in Miami, one ready to make a serious Super Bowl
run. Miami, which finished 10-6 last season and reached the second
round of the playoffs, did not lose any prime free agents during
the off season. It gained a few sparkling ones in defensive end
Rich Owens, tackle Kevin Gogan, wide receiver Tony Martin and
running back Tyrone Wheatley, and drafted impact players including
running backs J.J. Johnson, Cecil Collins and Rob Konrad. A defense
that allowed the fewest points in the league last year (265) still
has as its complement Dan Marino, a quarterback yearning to win at
least one Super Bowl late in his career.
</P>
<P>
   And no NFL team has a coaching setup quite like Miami's with
Wannstedt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sit in on free-agency meetings, salary cap meetings, in
discussions with agents with Jimmy, on draft decisions, on
offensive meetings, defensive meetings, special teams _ I try to
cover all bases and walk in and not assume anything, offer a fresh
perspective and help to create a sense of urgency,'' Wannstedt
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jimmy is head coach and general manager and everything that
goes on here goes across his desk. This is a team like some of the
others Jimmy has had, with youth and speed. It's going to be a
team, if it stays healthy, that can beat anybody. Sure, there is
Super Bowl talk. Every team believes it has that chance or it has
no chance. There is some reason here, though, to believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   There was not, however, in Chicago, where Wannstedt's record was
41-57, including 4-12 the last two seasons. Poor free-agent
acquisitions, poor free-agent retention and poor drafts _ in all of
which Wannstedt was involved _ helped doom him. .
</P>
<P>
   In Miami's voluntary practices this month, Wannsetdt has seen
good players. He will see more in Miami's minicamp beginning June
1. The Dolphins are especially strong on the defensive line, where
the starters Tim Bowens, Daryl Gardener, Jason Taylor and Kenny
Mixon are good. Wannstedt's specialty is defense. Maybe he can help
them become great linemen. Dominant ones.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is to win the American Conference East, where the Jets,
Buffalo and New England reside, strong teams all. Wannstedt will
most likely work from the press box during games with both
offensive coordinator Kippy Brown and defensive coordinator George
Hill, piping information to Johnson on the sideline. He will be the
ears and eyes for Johnson while creating new opportunities for
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to try and help these young players mature into
dominant players and help this good team become a dominant team,''
Wannstedt said. ``I'm going to coach 'em and work 'em along with
the entire staff here and see if we can reach that next level.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's plenty of time for Jimmy and me to talk now. We jog
every day and some of our best work and ideas come then. How far do
we run? Depends on how many Heinekens and nachos went down from the
night before. I've been involved in four championship teams with
Jimmy, two at the University of Miami and two in Dallas. We
click.''
</P>
<P>
   Might the Dolphins now, too? &QL;

NFL NOTEBOOK: FAST STARTS FOR TWO ROOKIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Among the draft picks already wooing their teammates and coaches
are Antoine Winfield at Buffalo and Daunte Culpepper at Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Winfield, a cornerback, has impressed the Bills with his tough
style and big plays. At Ohio State, Winfield, who is 5 feet 9
inches, was known for playing in a fashion bigger than his size
indicated. But Buffalo has found that his quickness and speed are
even better than perceived. There is every indication, already,
that he will be a Bills starter.
</P>
<P>
   Culpepper is soaring with the Vikings, where for now he is an
understudy to the starter, Randall Cunningham, and Cunningham's
backup, Jeff George.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had him rated as the highest player in the draft,'' said
Dennis Green, the Vikings head coach. ``Anytime you take a
first-year quarterback and put him in the sophisticated offense
we've had in place for eight years, you expect a rookie to look out
of place. But this looks second-nature to him. He's got it all _
size, speed, competitiveness and character, and he's making the
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   When Minnesota drafted Culpepper, there was instant murmuring of
``Culpepper to Moss.'' The quarterback to the rookie receiver from
a year ago, Randy Moss, could become an NFL staple of the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy is a guy who splashed on the scene a year ago and is
barely 22 years old,'' Green said. ``Daunte and him have a chance
to do some great things for a while. Both of them have amazing
stories. They make you open-minded. They take you outside of the
box.''
</P>
<P>
   A Steward for Stewart
</P>
<P>
   It got ugly for Steelers quarterback Kordell Stewart last year:
five consecutive losses to end the season, a 7-9 record, only 11
passing touchdowns (10 fewer than the year before) and a sulky,
somber presence.
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh head coach Bill Cowher did something about it. First,
he told Stewart and the world that this was still the Pittsburgh
quarterback. And then Cowher hired Kevin Gilbride, one of the most
organized, productive and efficient offensive minds in football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year Kordell fell on his face and we all did,'' Cowher
said. ``It wasn't easy. But especially for Kordell, it was
humbling. I think he might have needed that. Now he knows how hard
it is to win and keep winning and stay there as a quarterback and
he appreciates the good times because of that down time. I have
every faith in him and that the new coaching from Kevin Gilbride
will make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   The Steelers made a tangible show of their faith, signing
Stewart to a three-year contract extension that means he will earn
$27 million over the next five years, including an $8.1 million
signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe in Kordell,'' Cowher said. ``You watch, this
year is going to be something, because Kordell is going to come
back awfully strong. I really believe it. I'm counting on it.''

CURT SCHILLING'S APPROACH: COMPLETE AND CANDID 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Whether he is fairly paid or underpaid, Curt Schilling earns his
money. No, he more than earns it. He works overtime, both on days
when he is supposed to work and on days when he is supposed to be
off. In an era of pitch counts and pitcher pampering, Schilling is
the square peg in the round hole. He just doesn't fit.
</P>
<P>
   The dean of the Philadelphia Phillies' attractive young team,
Schilling is the reincarnation of Robin Roberts, the team's Hall of
Fame pitching star of the first half of the 1950s, a player who
more often than not completed what he started.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, Schilling led the major leagues in pitchers'
blue-collar statistics, working 268 2/3 innings and throwing 4,213
pitches, according to Stats Inc. Half of that work was the result
of a major league-leading 15 complete games, which matched the most
anyone has achieved since Roger Clemens completed 18 starts in
1987.
</P>
<P>
   Earning about one-third of Kevin Brown's average salary of $15
million, Schilling again leads in complete games with four, double
anyone else's total, and is near the top in innings pitched and
pitches thrown.
</P>
<P>
   He also apparently leads the league in outspokenness, which
resulted, he told some Mets players, in screaming matches with
Phillies managing partner David Montgomery and general manager Ed
Wade last Thursday. The confrontations stemmed from his comments in
interviews that ownership wasn't committed to winning.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies' officials took exception to his stinging remarks,
but they have never had a problem with his work ethic, which sets
Schilling apart from most starting pitchers working today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I approach the game as mine,'' Schilling said. ``With pitch
counts and all the junk that comes with being a young pitcher in
the '90s, it's not something a lot of teams are interested in
pushing their kids to do. They don't care to have them learn what
it's like to get a guy out for a fourth time without your good
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The questionable lesson, he said, is not lost on pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've run into a lot more guys who get pulled out after six
with a lead and have a smile on their face than guys who are angry
being pulled after six,'' Schilling said.
</P>
<P>
   This 32-year-old right-hander becomes angry with anyone who is
responsible for his premature departure, especially himself. He
puts in too much effort, he feels, not to be in a game in the ninth
inning. He is scheduled to start against the New York Mets at Shea
Stadium on Sunday, and he has been preparing for this start since
his last one on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm putting my Mets game plan together now,'' Schilling said
last week. ``I envision a way to get a hitter out, and there will
be variables to that. I'll get so and so out this way; he's the
kind of hitter who won't adjust, so I'll keep pitching him that way
unless he adjusts. This guy I have to change. The first at-bat,
I'll do this, the next time this. These are things I write down in
my notes and have on the bench with me.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole mind-set in devising my game plan is to get ready to
get each hitter out three or four times a night. So I prepare to be
the guy getting hitters out in the ninth inning in their fourth
at-bat. I don't know any other way to get ready to pitch other than
going nine. I've never approached it any other way.''
</P>
<P>
   The tools of Schilling's preparation are as important to his
success as his fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have notes on hitters, notes on umpires; everything I need
to be ready to pitch on the day I pitch,'' he said. ``I've been
keeping notes since 1992. I have every at-bat on my laptop. There's
no reason why I shouldn't be able to go out and win if I throw
strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   When Schilling had been in the major leagues for only a week, in
September 1989, after being called up by Baltimore, the Orioles
were playing in Texas, and he and his fellow rookie Ben McDonald
mustered the nerve to talk to Nolan Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said there are things I can and can't do on days I pitch,''
Schilling related, recalling the conversation vividly. ``He said I
can't control the weather, the umpires or the emotional state of
the other team. But I can control one thing. I can be better
prepared than the hitters I face that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``If preparation was that important to him, everybody else
should be playing catch up. It took me a while to figure out how to
do that. I've done it. I believe I'm better prepared than any
hitter I face.''
</P>
<P>
   But even the best laid plans go awry once in a while, no?
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to prepare so thoroughly that there's never a situation
that arises in a game that surprises me,'' Schilling said. ``I
might be not sure of myself because I have more than one idea, but
I'm never surprised because surprise is not a good thing. I've made
200 starts and never been shocked on the mound by something.''
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, who has never won more than 17 games in a season, is
off to his best start, with a 7-1 record, since the Phillies'
pennant-winning season of 1993. With Randy Johnson in the National
League, Schilling is unlikely to lead the league in strikeouts for
the third successive season, but he could still join Ryan as the
only pitchers in history to strike out 300 or more batters in three
successive seasons. He has 58 strikeouts and a 2.58 earned run
average.
</P>
<P>
   The garrulous Schilling did not reach this juncture as an
overnight sensation. He was traded three times in less than four
years before he established himself as a major league starter.
</P>
<P>
   Boston traded him and Brady Anderson to the Orioles in 1988 for
Mike Boddicker. The Orioles sent him to Houston with Pete Harnisch
and Steve Finley in a 1991 trade for Glenn Davis. And then the
Astros traded him to the Phillies in 1992 for Jason Grimsley, who
seven seasons later has revived his pitching career with the New
York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Now Schilling is the most sought-after pitcher in the majors.
Just about every contending team that does not have a platoon of
good starters is eager to acquire him by the July 31 nonwaiver
trading deadline, if not before. The hitch is that the Phillies do
not have to trade him; they have Schilling under contract through
the 2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Phillies could add to their nucleus of good young
players by trading Schilling, who has a no-trade provision, meaning
he has to approve the team he would be traded to.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first choice is where I'm at,'' the pitcher said. ``I want
to be here if something positive is going to happen with this club.
That's really up to the ownership of this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing the Phillies' low, $30 million payroll, Schilling said he
has seen no signs in the last couple of years that the owners are
serious about contending.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ownership has to step up and help, come the trading deadline,
and make a financial commitment to this team,'' he said. ``If they
don't want to do that, I don't want to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that Schilling doesn't like what he sees in the surprising
Phillies, who are 21-19 after Friday night's 7-5 loss to the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a different environment to pitch in from what I've
been accustomed to here the last four, five years,'' he said. ``It
changes your mentality as a pitcher. Going through what we've gone
through, with nobody to blame but ourselves, for the last five
years, it's nice to see a big league club take the field every day
and not a patchwork collection of guys. We have an incredibly
talented nucleus of young players.''
</P>
<P>
   As complimentary as Schilling was about the team, he incurred
the wrath of Phillies owners and executives when he repeated his
comments about lack of commitment on Major League Baseball's weekly
national telephone conference call last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Ed Wade, whom Schilling praised in the interview
for doing the best he could under the economic circumstances
imposed upon him, criticized his star pitcher for being anything
but positive about the Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to Schilling's charge that the team hadn't tried to
upgrade its pitching staff with an established starter, Wade said
in a statement, ``There is not a club in baseball that has been
more active than the Phillies in its pursuit of starting
pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Schilling passed up the chance to play out his contract
and leave the Phillies as a free agent. He opted to stay, signing a
contract that will pay him an average of not quite $5.5 million a
year for four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I chose to stay with the team that was loyal to me for two
years when I was hurt,'' Schilling said. ``Would I like to be
making twice as much as I am? Sure, who wouldn't? But I'm being
paid an obscene amount of money, even though it's half of what the
market value says I'm worth. I'm still making more money than 99.9
percent of the people walking the earth. And I get it for doing
something I've been doing since I was 4 years old.''

 &HT;    APACHE ROLE QUESTIONED BY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS
 &HT;    Moving in (i) international and (w) Washington categories
 &HT;    By Joseph Albright
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rinas Air Base, Albania -- Frustration over the fact Apache
helicopters have not been used in the war in Kosovo surfaced
Saturday among members of Congress on a two-day tour of NATO
military installations and refugee camps in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did they bring them (the Apaches) in here?'' asked Rep.
David L.
</P>
<P>
   Hobson, R-Ohio, who led the 11-member delegation. ``I would have
preferred that he (President Clinton) didn't take any option off
the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are engaged in a war, you need to use all the
components available to you,'' said House minority whip David E.
Bonior (D-Mich.), the ranking Democrat in the delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week ago, Clinton said the Apache's mission of
attacking Serbian positions in Kosovo was being reassigned to the
Air Force's A-10 attack planes. The president said the low-flying
Apaches would be too vulnerable to shoulder-carried missiles fired
by Serbian gunners.
</P>
<P>
   Hobson's delegation met with a half-dozen Apache pilots from a
squadron that lost two comrades in a training crash two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, Hobson said: ``I've talked to them, and they are
prepared to do the mission. And I think they should do it if the
time and mission is appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonior said he would not ``second guess'' Clinton. But he added:
``I clearly think it is important to have all the components
available to you as a threat to an enemy. The fact that they are
here, ready and trained, is something that Milosevic ought to
understand and consider. More important, it is something that his
troops
</P>
<P>
   that are dug in ought to consider.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Apache was designed to fight, essentially, World War III
in Europe, versus the finest anti-aircraft systems the Soviets can
manufacture,'' said Capt. Mark Arden, a pilot and the adjutant of
the Apache unit. ``So for us to act as if the Apache is not able to
deal with threats out here I think is to discount the abilities of
the Apache.''
</P>
<P>
   Hobson, who is chairman of the House military construction
</P>
<P>
   subcommittee, said he has been told it has cost roughly $700
million to deploy and train the Apache task force of roughly 5,000
</P>
<P>
   troops.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim follows)
</P>
<P>
   The congressional delegation spent an hour at the Army camp next
to the air strip at Rinas Air Base, and the rest of the day with
U.S. Air Force and NATO officers assigned to cope with the more
than 400,000 Kosovar refugees in
</P>
<P>
   Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very serious water problem in all these refugee
camps,''
</P>
<P>
   Hobson said after a briefing by refugee aid officials. ``In this
country
</P>
<P>
   there is a lot of water, but it is not in the right places.''

SPORTS COLUMN: KNICKS DOMINATE THEIR FOES, AND OUR MINDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   All hands on deck. All shore leaves canceled. Nobody is going
anywhere while the Knicks are on a rampage.
</P>
<P>
   There are all kinds of sports going on this spring. College
lacrosse at Hofstra on Saturday. The Indy 500 next weekend. But I
know, I know, everybody wants to talk about the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   The basketball playoffs are like the old Sergeant Pepper movie,
with the Knicks flitting through the East, turning people into
stone in their wake. Tim Hardaway, as inert as an Easter Island
statue. Pat Riley, his features as frozen as a Mayan sculpture.
Steve Smith, the balls of his feet stuck to the floor like those of
a Degas dancer.
</P>
<P>
   My theory about the playoffs is that the Heat and the Hawks have
hit the wall, right on schedule, 50-plus games into the season.
That usually happens in February, with guys plodding through weeks
at a time and nobody noticing or caring. But in this season,
shortened by the lockout, the wall has arrived at the start of the
playoffs. Since the Knicks frittered away part of the season tuning
out Van Gundy and each other, they have energy to burn.
</P>
<P>
   Could be the Knicks will never reach the wall. It's quite likely
that the Indiana Pacers will devour the Knicks in the next round.
Jalen Rose will be to the Knicks what Latrell Sprewell is to the
Hawks. Mark Jackson will post up the Knicks' point guards, just as
a way of saying hi to his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball is not the only winter sport lingering into spring.
The Stanley Cup playoffs have an intriguing pairing between Buffalo
and Toronto, those two neighbors linked by Queen Elizabeth Way, the
highway where Americans try to puzzle out how many liters fill a
gas tank.
</P>
<P>
   Wouldn't it be nice to be near Lake Ontario in late May? Aw, but
you want to talk about the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   People want to talk about Marcus Camby, he of the tomahawk dunk
right over that international benefactor, Dikembe Mutombo.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago Camby was Exhibit A for the young and the clueless,
out of shape, out of synch, the kind of wastrel who could get a
general manager fired in an organization looking for a scapegoat.
</P>
<P>
   Now Camby is fresh and rested, sullen but somewhat short of
mutinous. The playoffs are all about matchups, and Atlanta has
nobody who can match his leaps. Camby is Jeff Van Gundy's secret
weapon. Say, do you think the sly coach kept him in wraps all
season just for this element of surprise?
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there are so many other issues to discuss. Gen. Barry
McCaffrey, the White House director of national drug control
policy, still wants to investigate the impact of androstenedione,
the legal body-building supplement used last year by Mark McGwire
when he hit 70 homers. Most sports authorities have banned it as a
dangerous steroid, but baseball is banking on our soppy instant
nostalgia for that wonderful year of 1998, and we'll forget about
andro.
</P>
<P>
   Andro. Andro. Andro. Right, but you want to talk about the
Knicks. You want to talk about Chris Dudley, the hulk from Yale,
who sat for two straight games against Miami and did not let the
layoff ruin his attitude, and bellied up to Mutombo two games in a
row in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Subs are important. Back when the Knicks were really the Knicks,
people used to spend hours discussing the fine points of subs like
Nate Bowman, Iron Mike Riordan, Dave the Rave Stallworth and Phil
Jackson. What ever became of Phil Jackson?
</P>
<P>
   What with the Knicks and all, have you noticed that racing has
another chance for its first Triple Crown winner since 1978?
Charismatic has dashed through the Kentucky Derby and the
Preakness, en route to the Belmont, 13 days from today. Will it be
the cavern of the Garden in early June, or the fragrant barns of
Belmont? Maybe Rik Smits will get us outdoors in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   We really shouldn't be talking basketball. The weather's too
nice. Time to get out to the ball park and boo the third-base coach
for not flipping the ball into the stands. It seems that baseball _
this sounds like lawyer stuff to me _ is afraid of lawsuits
resulting from brawny louts (undoubtedly on andro) stomping
children in their zeal for balls tossed into the stands. The
post-strike goodwill era is over.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball had its own labor troubles. We all vowed we would not
recognize basketball this season, but here we are, talking about
the Spurs, talking about Iverson, talking about the Blazers,
talking about Bird's coaching, talking about Spree.
</P>

   I could tell you all about the FA Cup final Saturday, Manchester
United against Newcastle United, at Wembley. What's that? You want
to talk about the Knicks? The game is listed for 3 p.m. in New York
today, followed by Sprewell a few minutes later. Catch the sour
look on his face when Van Gundy calls his name. We are into the
subtleties of facial expressions. It's all about the Knicks.

 &HT;    APACHE ROLE QUESTIONED BY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS
 &HT;    Moving in (i) international and (w) Washington categories

   Rinas Air Base, Albania -- Frustration over the fact Apache
helicopters have not been used in the war in Kosovo surfaced
Saturday among members of Congress on a two-day tour of NATO
military installations and refugee camps in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did they bring them (the Apaches) in here?'' asked Rep.
David L.
</P>
<P>
   Hobson, R-Ohio, who led the 11-member delegation. ``I would have
preferred that he (President Clinton) didn't take any option off
the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are engaged in a war, you need to use all the
components available to you,'' said House minority whip David E.
Bonior (D-Mich.), the ranking Democrat in the delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Less than a week ago, Clinton said the Apache's mission of
attacking Serbian positions in Kosovo was being reassigned to the
Air Force's A-10 attack planes. The president said the low-flying
Apaches would be too vulnerable to shoulder-carried missiles fired
by Serbian gunners.
</P>
<P>
   Hobson's delegation met with a half-dozen Apache pilots from a
squadron that lost two comrades in a training crash two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Afterwards, Hobson said: ``I've talked to them, and they are
prepared to do the mission. And I think they should do it if the
time and mission is appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonior said he would not ``second guess'' Clinton. But he added:
``I clearly think it is important to have all the components
available to you as a threat to an enemy. The fact that they are
here, ready and trained, is something that Milosevic ought to
understand and consider. More important, it is something that his
troops
</P>
<P>
   that are dug in ought to consider.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Apache was designed to fight, essentially, World War III
in Europe, versus the finest anti-aircraft systems the Soviets can
manufacture,'' said Capt. Mark Arden, a pilot and the adjutant of
the Apache unit. ``So for us to act as if the Apache is not able to
deal with threats out here I think is to discount the abilities of
the Apache.''
</P>
<P>
   Hobson, who is chairman of the House military construction
</P>
<P>
   subcommittee, said he has been told it has cost roughly $700
million to deploy and train the Apache task force of roughly 5,000
</P>
<P>
   troops.
</P>
<P>
   (optional trim follows)
</P>
<P>
   The congressional delegation spent an hour at the Army camp next
to the air strip at Rinas Air Base, and the rest of the day with
U.S. Air Force and NATO officers assigned to cope with the more
than 400,000 Kosovar refugees in
</P>
<P>
   Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a very serious water problem in all these refugee
camps,''
</P>
<P>
   Hobson said after a briefing by refugee aid officials. ``In this
country
</P>
<P>
   there is a lot of water, but it is not in the right places.''

SPORTS COLUMN: THE TAMING OF THE SHREWD IVERSON

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ When we made a run, they were chillin','' said
Tyrone Hill, assessing the damage after his Philadelphia 76ers got
whipped again by Indiana, 97-86, Friday night here in First Union
Center. ``They're a veteran team. We're a young team. But we're
learning.''
</P>
<P>
   They'd better cram quick, call in a battalion of hoop tutors,
have their noses in their playbooks till game time, because they
play again this afternoon at home and face being swept in this
second-round playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   It's a tribute, however, to the team, and particularly the
coach, the peregrination expert Larry Brown _ this is the sixth
team he has coached in the National Basketball Association, and the
sixth different team he has taken to the playoffs _ that they are
here at all. Few expected a virtually new dramatis personae to
perform at this level, making the playoffs and then knocking off
the favored Orlando Magic in the first round. And as late as eight
weeks ago, it seemed highly unlikely, at best.
</P>
<P>
   The Sixers had played the Cavaliers and Philadelphia's youthful,
exciting, gifted, high-scoring, resplendently coifed second-year
guard, Allen Iverson, had, as Brown recalls, ``run his mouth'' when
Brown had removed him from the game _ after 12 minutes and an
0-for-7 shooting night _ and sulked at the end of the bench.
</P>
<P>
   When Brown called to return him to action, Iverson repeated his
profane lecture to the coach. Brown stopped Iverson in his tracks
and sat him for the rest of the game, which the 76ers lost. Brown
told the news media afterward that Iverson did not play again
because he was ``hurt.'' The implication was not necessarily to the
ego.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, the Sixers, who had added by trade, draft and
acquisition such significant new players this season as Matt
Geiger, Theo Ratliff, Eric Snow, Aaron McKie, Larry Hughes, George
Lynch and Hill, were contending to make the playoffs for the first
time since 1991. At practice the next day, Iverson showed up late.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't let this continue,'' Brown said. ``He's a young kid
and this is what young kids do. And maybe he was embarrassed by my
taking him out of the game, and it had become a public issue. But
still, I was going to confront Allen. I had to.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when Aaron McKie, a fifth-year veteran, stepped in.
``Coach,'' he told Brown, ``let us handle it.'' Meaning, the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``But by me not doing anything, I don't want you guys to lose
respect for me,'' Brown replied. ``And I know Allen growing up had
it hard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hold it, Coach,'' interrupted McKie. ``Everyone in that locker
room has had it hard. Allen's important to us. We've got a good
shot at the playoffs. We don't want to blow it now. Let us talk to
him.''
</P>
<P>
   And they did. They told the 23-year-old Iverson that it's ``a
mental thing'' for everybody to follow rules, to get the maximum
effort by being on time, practicing hard _ something he hasn't
always done _ and listening to the coach who all, including the
sometimes recalcitrant Iverson, seem to esteem.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're competitive,'' McKie said to Iverson, ``the coach is
competitive. But you don't need to go overboard.''
</P>
<P>
   Iverson listened. ``I gotta stop messin' up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the next game, when Iverson was given a rest, he came off the
floor and sat down next to Brown, to discuss strategy, of all
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allen,'' Brown said with a straight face, ``you're ruining my
image. Maybe you should get back to where you normally sit.''
</P>
<P>
   Iverson laughed. And every time he comes out of a game now, he
sits beside the coach, including Friday night, when assistant
coaches and players all moved down a seat to give Iverson room
beside Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allen knows when he's done wrong,'' Brown said. ``Some kids,
you can't reason with. Allen, you can. And I know where his heart
is. I know he's a good kid. And he's maturing.''
</P>
<P>
   On the court, Iverson often appears an unfettered athletic
genius, swift as an arrow, daring as a trapeze artist,
unpredictable as a kaleidoscope. But he does not always look as if
he is familiar with the depth and the nuances of the game of
basketball. He shot 13-for-33 Friday night, and seemed unable to
pace himself after having scored 20 points in the first half. True,
he understood that his team was involved in a critical game and he
must do all he can as soon as he can _ but still, the game is four
quarters long. And it appears he is reluctant to pass the ball
unless he is flying through the air and unable to get off a shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows that a great player helps make his teammates
better,'' Brown said. ``And he is making progress.''
</P>
<P>
   Not enough for Julius Erving, however. It was Erving, the former
Sixers great, who said there are ``a hundred guys playing street
ball who can play like Iverson.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown said he took offense at the remark. ``Julius is one of the
classiest guys in the world,'' Brown said, ``and he is idolized in
this town. But for him to say that about Allen was terrible. Allen
and this team are underdogs. And he's a young kid trying to do the
right things. And he's doing exactly what the coach has told him to
do _ well, not a hundred percent, but he's getting there.''
</P>
<P>
   He's not there yet, and it seems unlikely that he will be there
this afternoon. But it's not impossible. There is, after all, no
accounting for genius.

DRYDEN'S DRIVE FOR SUCCESS IN TORONTO 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ Ken Dryden is a tall man accustomed to high
achievement. After entering the hockey Hall of Fame as a goalie,
earning a law degree and prospering as an author and television
documentarian, Dryden became president and general manager of the
Toronto Maple Leafs, who are to hockey in English-speaking Canada
what Notre Dame is to college football in the United States, only
more so.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his second season as a novice executive, Dryden's
rebuilt team has soared from playoff absenteeism to the final four
of the Stanley Cup playoffs. The Maple Leafs will open the Eastern
Conference finals Sunday afternoon in Air Canada Center against the
Buffalo Sabres.
</P>
<P>
   Friday represented a new height, even for Dryden, now 51,
slightly gray at the temples, hair a little thin on top. On the
Peace Bridge, well above the Niagara River, which separates Buffalo
and New York and the United States from Fort Erie and Ontario and
Canada, Dryden and John Rigas, the owner of the Buffalo Sabres,
climbed into the bucket of a cherry picker on a crane that lifted
them even higher.
</P>
<P>
   Outlined against a blue, May, transborder sky, they pulled ropes
to hoist the flags of their two teams. The banners temporarily
replaced those of the states and provinces and will remain there
until either the Maple Leafs or the Sabres win the right to face
either Dallas or Colorado in the Stanley Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   Dryden's brief speech, at the base of the flag poles, was more
down to earth. In discussing hockey, which he calls Canada's
national theater, Dryden often alludes to other sports or to
literature and film, and this was no exception. This series between
neighboring cities, he said, would produce scenes like one in the
basketball film ``Hoosiers,'' which showed the headlights of cars
filled with fans traveling between Indiana towns to watch ``their
team on the road'' in high school competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, there will be a lot of that, going in both directions,''
Dryden said. ``So, let's let the games begin.''
</P>
<P>
   During the ceremony, as motorists lined up for customs and
immigration inspection, they honked their horns, called out to
Dryden and waved. A man from Welland, Ontario, who said he had
worked all night in an auto plant and had not yet been to bed,
approached Dryden in the midday sun and handed him a hand-lettered
sweatshirt that proclaimed Dryden ``Most Valuable President.''
After meeting Dryden, the man stood to the side with his wife,
hugging and kissing her, with tears in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   As Dryden walked to his car after the ceremony, a woman in an
official uniform, who had escorted him to the podium before the
ceremony, stood watching Dryden, her eyes wide, her gaze rapt.
Against the border guard's chest, protected by her crossed arms,
was the folded fabric of the American flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you, nice to meet you,'' Dryden said to her, extending
his hand to shake hers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' she said, smiling and nodding in a way that bordered on
a bow.
</P>
<P>
   Back in his black Saab, Dryden steered toward Toronto, which is
about a two-hour drive from Buffalo on a road called Queen
Elizabeth Way. Next was a board meeting at Air Canada Center, the
Leafs' new arena. Like many athletes and former athletes, Dryden
drove faster than most motorists, shifting lanes and accelerating
with calculated confidence. As he drove, he talked, some of his
answers lasting 10 kilometers, which is 6.2 miles by American
measure. He spoke of his job, his sport, his life and how sport is
life and life is sport and work is sometimes fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Toronto Maple Leafs already were special,'' he said.
``What they needed to become is a successful team. They are an
important team, by definition, by being in Toronto, by the history
they bring to the game and to the league. But what the Toronto
Maple Leafs had not been, for a long time, in any consistent way,
was a successful team. And that was wrong. There wasn't a good
reason why they couldn't be. And the league was weaker for it and
hockey in this country was weaker for it and the fans were unhappy
for it and that's too bad. What you first need to do is sort of
break the back of 30 years of disappointment, resentment,
frustration, bitterness.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, the Leafs have done this, becoming not only winners
but also entertaining and high-scoring. In a decade of mechanical
defensive systems and dwindling scores, the Leafs blew like a
crisp, cool breeze out of Canada, a brisk wind of change. In the
councils of hockey bosses, Dryden's voice was heard and heeded. It
probably did not hurt that he attended Cornell, the same school as
Commissioner Gary Bettman, although Dryden graduated before Bettman
arrived. Dryden got the league to move the Leafs from the Western
Conference back to the East. Although he was a great goalie, Dryden
argued against large goalie equipment and the unfair advantages it
gave netminders and helped write new rules to restrict it. And he
argued forcefully against the hooking, holding and interference
that negates skilled players.
</P>
<P>
   ``The challenge is for offense to overcome defense,'' Dryden
said, saying the balance had become ``out of whack.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``We're doing somewhat better that way but we need to
still do better.''
</P>
<P>
   His car sped along, around big trucks, slowing down as it went
past a police car, then gradually picking up the pace. Dryden
laughed as he spotted a sign above the one welcoming drivers to
Stoney Creek, Ontario. The sign said, ``Go, Sabres, Go,'' and
Dryden said, ``I wonder how long that sign will last.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In response to questions, he changed topics as smoothly as he
changed lanes. He talked of how he micromanaged much of the decor
of the new arena, insisting that photographs that hung in the
corridors of old Maple Leaf Gardens be enlarged and placed in the
halls of the new building. That, he said, is the way to make a new
arena feel like home. Some scenes from ancient games can be viewed
from the sidewalks outside the new building, even when it is dark
and locked.
</P>
<P>
   And he insisted that black-and-white photographs of fans from
the 1940s and 1950s be displayed around the rim of the seating
areas, between the high and low bowls, so that modern fans would
have a connection with the past. High above them, on big, blue
banners that hang from the rafters, Dryden designed and displayed
photographs of past Leaf greats, some of them deceased, their
motionless eyes gazing down over current players and fans.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on the bigger picture of sport and life, Dryden said,
``In the last generation, sports has become mainstream in terms of
life,'' no longer just ``this separate, idealized world.'' He seems
to see himself as a producer, director and guardian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure there are many experiences through which people
learn more than they do through sport, and watching that drama
night after night, year after year, on the television screens and
through the newspaper,'' Dryden said. ``Kids are learning lessons,
parents are learning lessons. That's what you are picking up: `Be
like so-and-do. Don't be like somebody else.' In what other area
are more people experiencing the same things as vividly? It's
there, uncontrollable, right there in front of you. For good and
bad, sport has immense influence.''
</P>
<P>
   He paused, perhaps aware that his voice had become louder, with
emotion, his hands briefly leaving the steering wheel as he
gestured. Dryden remains in touch with his childhood self as a
sports fan. He talked of how his father took him on a tour of major
league baseball parks one summer and of how he did the same thing a
few years ago with his son, now in college. He still has, Dryden
said, a letter from Elston Howard, the late Yankee catcher, which
Howard wrote to him in the 1950s, when Dryden was a boy and Howard
was a young prospect playing for a minor league team then called
the Toronto Maple Leafs. Dryden recalled getting Frank Mahovlich's
autograph four times as a schoolboy when the Big M was a Leafs
hockey star.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's supposed to stand for a moment of connection,'' he said
of autographs. ``Don't you remember when you were a kid and you
asked for autographs? Have you forgotten? For a moment, I felt like
I was in the same world as Frank.''
</P>
<P>
   He said a child's relationship with an athlete, even if they
never meet, is an early chapter in a book of that child's life
story.
</P>
<P>
   So many subjects, so little time. The car purred through
Hamilton and Burlington and Oakville and Mississauga. By now, the
city skyline loomed, the soaring CN Tower, the retractable white
roof of the Skydome, the steel and glass skyscrapers among the
low-rise piles of Victorian bricks that make Toronto seem to some
like the emerald city of Oz. When the conversation veered somehow
into mountain climbing, Dryden told of meeting a man who climbed a
peak called K2 in the Himalayas and how, on the way down, the man's
companion slipped and fell and died. When he was 20, Dryden said,
he might have tried something like that. But in his middle age, he
said, such things aren't worth the risk. His climbs and journeys
now are more metaphorical.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come some distance,'' he said of his team's progress.
``It's a fragile distance. And it can be reversed. The distance
from the bottom to the top is just not as far as you think it is or
as far as it used to be. The bad news is the reverse is also true.
It doesn't take much to fall very far, very fast.''

SPORTS COLUMN: SOCCER MOMS WHO PLAY ARE AN EXAMPLE FOR CHILDREN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The biggest sports trophy in my house does not belong to me or
either of my young sons. My wife carried it home several weeks ago
after her soccer team won its league's inaugural championship. The
boys were more startled by the size of the trophythan the fact that
their mother had won it, or that she even plays a game that most
suburban children believe to be their precious and exclusive
domain.
</P>
<P>
   And this, I believe, has not only been a triumph for her but for
them.
</P>
<P>
   At 40, my wife, Beth Albert, took up soccer this year, and her
team immediately claimed its place in the boys' coterie of teams to
root for. For children 9 and 5, granted, there is a capricious
nature to these things, but last week, given a choice between the
Knicks' playoff game on television and the Bluestone Belles against
the Pokemoms over at our town's indoor soccer facility, they left
their father home alone on the couch with his clicker and the
chips.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't help smiling as they trudged out the door, promising
to behave. I recalled the questions raised by my colleague Robert
Lipsyte about a runaway jock culture that continues to produce
raging specimens who can't distinguish between an opponent standing
in their way and a woman getting on their nerves. On the subject of
the potential remedies, Lipsyte requested of readers, if we may
assume society isn't about to wake up one morning in a less
fanatical sports mood, it is logical to hope that more of the same
for women and girls is one path toward heightened mutual respect,
if not a solution unto itself.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Junior may not be as likely to bask in his
athletic and physical superiority if he is told enough times that
he can't have the field this afternoon, because his sister's
playing at 2, and then, if he's really lucky, his mother's on at 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``Treat your daughters as you would your sons, and be conscious
of the fact that you may not be,'' writes the soccer coach and
trainer Ashley Hammond in a new book, ``Goal! The Ultimate Guide
for Soccer Moms and Dads'' (Rodale Press), co-authored with the
writer Gloria Averbuch.
</P>
<P>
   More than two-and-one-half decades after Title IX, this may
sound like obvious advice but the truth is that it may not feel
entirely legitimate in a sports universe so conditioned to ascribe
greater significance to what boys and men produce on the field. As
a father who has been involved in sports his entire life and has
even coached his beginner kids in an unfamiliar game, I'll be
honest: it feels very strange to have been so abruptly displaced as
the hip sports parent, the one who leads by example and whose
tactical advice has greater weight. Strange, but equally thrilling
to know that my sons now recognize their soccer mom as someone who
packs serious clout, along with game-day snacks.
</P>
<P>
   Opportunity doesn't necessarily beget equality. It wasn't until
last year that Hammond, who came to the Essex County area of New
Jersey area about a decade ago from England, decided to
``experiment,'' to train an under-8 girls' team as seriously as he
trained the boys. That meant more practices, harder practices, in
bad weather. Many parents were skeptical, and even Hammond had
preconceived notions, but his conclusion after one season of
perfect attendance and convincing achievement was this: ``Don't set
limits. If you treat them as soccer players, they will go out and
work as hard, if not harder, than any of the boys' teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Averbuch, the mother of two soccer-playing daughters, has stood
on the sideline this year and watched her 12-year-old, Yael,
compete on an elite boys' 13-and-under team. For a mother, the
athletic achievement in itself has been inspirational but nothing
compared to the moment when an opposing coach could be overheard
lecturing his players: ``I don't want to hear one remark. I've seen
her play and if you underestimate her, she'll leave you flat on
your behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Many advanced young girls compete with boys but the overwhelming
majority are separated before they can read. Then their games are
often treated as lesser events, friendly mornings outside, gender
equity exercise. Turn on the sports talk radio shows and there are
nothing but snickers if a caller dares broach the subject of
women's basketball or the coming Women's World Cup. Getting the
chance to play sports is one thing. Getting men to recognize that a
women's game is just as meaningful is another.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that 42 percent of the kids playing soccer nationally
are girls is an extraordinary statistic,'' Averbuch said. Her point
was that this grass-roots game, probably more than others, presents
an important opportunity for parents to help re-pattern the way
boys view girls and, by extension, the way boys view boys.
</P>
<P>
   In the endgame, a more important trophy is the son who grows up
not thinking he's the sun and that women are in orbit around him.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The congressional investigation into China's
suspected theft of American technology began as a gleam in Newt
Gingrich's eye. Today, a year later, it has become the decade's
deepest look into a realm of cloaks and daggers that lives on after
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting report, due to be published on Tuesday after a
bitter struggle with the White House over its release, is likely to
alter American national security and foreign policy, slow the
export of technology and thus reshape the Clinton administration's
commercial diplomacy toward China.
</P>
<P>
   While the House was torn asunder over impeachment, the five
Republicans and four Democrats on the investigating panel, led by
Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., secretly and unanimously achieved
consensus. They concluded that China has been systematically
stealing information on American nuclear warheads and missiles from
the 1970s until today, according to officials familiar with their
report. Most unusually, they agreed not to divulge their explosive
findings _ and kept their word, even as Democrats and Republicans
fiercely contested the 1998 election.
</P>
<P>
   The Cox committee was never expected to delve so deeply into
secrets of state. The panel was created by Gingrich, then the
speaker of the House, to look, among other things, for possible
impeachable offenses in the Clinton administration's policy of
encouraging commercial exports to China, which Gingrich called ``a
threat to the survival of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   But last Oct. 15, the investigation took a new turn. The
committee was questioning Donald Rumsfeld, a former secretary of
defense and author of a highly classified report on missile threats
commissioned by Congress, on the subject of China's missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Cox asked a crucial question: How had the Chinese managed to
modernize their nuclear weapons program?
</P>
<P>
   The answer was a secret, replied Rumsfeld, so highly classified
that the committee could not be told. So Cox went to the CIA,
asking for inside information on China's espionage. And he got it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The committee started out going through a door, and we came
into a room, and there was more in that room than we thought there
would be,'' said Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., chairman of the House
Intelligence Committee and Cox committee member.
</P>
<P>
   In that room, the committee found evidence that relentless
espionage, assiduous research and open exchanges with American
scientists had saved China incalculable time and money in its drive
to build a modern nuclear arsenal, said officials who have been
told the contents of the committee's report.
</P>
<P>
   It learned of thefts of nuclear weapons information in the
mid-1990s _ yet another espionage case still under investigation,
whose details the report cannot publicly disclose. It believes that
Chinese spying continues at the nation's weapons laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   And it concluded that China will field a new generation of
nuclear weapons in coming years, based at least in part on stolen
information, that could alter the balance of power in Asia,
especially regarding Taiwan, which China views as a breakaway
province.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was what Chris Cox stumbled onto as he started peeling
the onion layers back,'' said William Schneider Jr., a Rumsfeld
commission member. ``The chairman had his eyes opened.''
</P>
<P>
   The secret files ``opened not only Chris' eyes, but all our
eyes,'' said Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., and Cox committee member.
</P>
<P>
   The committee's members do not necessarily believe that the
United States is directly threatened by China's nuclear advances.
The U.S. nuclear arsenal overwhelmingly outmatches China's. And
while espionage may have propelled a great leap toward modern
nuclear forces, China has not yet deployed a weapon based on the
stolen data.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it make them less dangerous? More dangerous? I don't
know,'' Goss said.
</P>
<P>
   Cox said the report ``ought not to chill relations'' between
Beijing and Washington, ``for the simple reason that the underlying
facts were known to both governments beforehand.'' But he said ``it
should provide the basis for a reassessment of U.S. policy'' toward
China.
</P>
<P>
   The report already has ignited a debate on the balance between
science and security at the national laboratories, not to mention
spawning 10 more congressional investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Its publication, after a five-month struggle over its
declassification, will cap an unusual effort to pierce the shield
of secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   In a city where secrets are hard to keep, the committee kept
them. They did not leak until after its report was completed and
the committee began battling the Clinton administration over its
declassification and release.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a sworn pact among the nine of us that we would not
divulge information, and for the first time in my career in
Congress, that worked,'' Weldon said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee began work in July with a seemingly narrow focus:
how American commercial satellite technology leaked to China under
export licenses approved by President Clinton and President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   It weighed, then dropped, explosive but unproven charges that
Chinese military and intelligence officials tried to sway the 1996
elections for the Democrats by buying access to politicians.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, ``Democrats were suspicious because the
Republicans had made it clear there were going to be impeachable
offenses here,'' said Rep. Norm Dicks of Washington, the
committee's ranking Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   But those suspicions subsided.
</P>
<P>
   Schneider, a State Department official in the Reagan
administration, said: ``Cox was seen by the Democrats as a fair guy
who was undertaking a narrow investigation into satellite launches.
The committee had a fixed life of six months, and Congress would be
out of session over much of that time, so they would not be around
to do the heavy lifting of reading documents.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox's staff included some who had served on the Rumsfeld
commission, which had uncovered at least one crucial file pointing
to Chinese nuclear espionage. They went to work in a windowless
bunker with 36 cubicles, ``burn bags'' for classified litter and
alarm systems to ward off visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy lifting began in October, after Cox gained access to
the secret intelligence files.
</P>
<P>
   The director of Central Intelligence, George Tenet, ``was
willing to give us access and to open the doors of the CIA,'' said
Weldon. ``That was a sea change, when George offered that
openness.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee was less successful on another front. Cox
repeatedly asked the Justice Department for information from
federal grand jury investigations of American companies' exports of
satellites, computers and machine tools to China. He was rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In late October, days before the 1998 elections, the committee
made its most important discovery.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1995, scientists at the Los Alamos nuclear laboratory
told Notra Trulock, then intelligence director at the Energy
Department, which oversees the national labs, of their fears that
China had achieved a remarkable breakthrough in its nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
   At about the same time that those fears were raised, the
intelligence files showed, a Chinese agent had handed over a secret
document to American officials. The document contained evidence
that China had stolen design data on American nuclear warheads and
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the CIA decided that the agent had been planted by the
Chinese intelligence service, to send a message whose meaning is
debated to this day. But the agency determined that the document he
had delivered contained at least a measure of truth _ that American
secrets had been stolen.
</P>
<P>
   This should have set off alarm bells at the national weapons
laboratories. But the alarms were broken, said Trulock, who became
the Cox committee's star witness in the fall of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   He secretly testified that he had tried to raise warnings about
espionage at the labs, but had been thwarted by his superiors at
the Energy Department.
</P>
<P>
   In late October, at a White House meeting, Bill Richardson, the
new energy secretary, pulled aside Sandy Berger, the national
security adviser, said a senior administration official. Richardson
said, in so many words: We're starting to get requests for
information from the Cox committee, and this China stuff is a
problem, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The White House knew what the committee wanted to know. Clinton
had been told about the problems at the weapons laboratories, but
no earlier than July 1997 and possibly as late as February 1998,
according to the varied recollections of Berger.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats said they feared the information about the Chinese
espionage would leak and damage them politically on the eve of the
November 1998 elections.
</P>
<P>
   It did not.
</P>
<P>
   As the storm of impeachment gathered over the Capitol, the nine
members of the committee struggled to finish their report, which
was approaching the length of a Russian novel. On Dec. 16, they
took their last testimony from Trulock, a self-described
whistle-blower. On Dec. 19, the House impeached the president.
</P>
<P>
   The Cox committee report was completed on Dec. 30, after less
than six months of intense work. It would take nearly five months
more to declassify it.
</P>
<P>
   In consultation with the committee, the White House declassified
the panel's 32 recommendations, including tightening security at
the labs, toughening export controls and sharing intelligence
information between government agencies. The White House, without
consulting the committee, released the Cox recommendations, along
with its own responses, to selected reporters on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were hoping to spin the report,'' Weldon said.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later Cox and Dicks asked to meet with Clinton to
discuss their findings. The White House did not respond for weeks.
For more than a month, Clinton did not have much to say in public
about the report's findings; some had already appeared in The New
York Times, The Wall Street Journal and other publications.
</P>
<P>
   On March 19, at a press conference, Clinton assured the public
that ``there has been no espionage at the labs since I have been
president'' and ``no one has reported to me that they suspect such
a thing has occurred.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout March and April, the White House and the committee
fought over how to declassify the report. Nearly a third of its
findings will remain secret at the behest of American intelligence
and law-enforcement agencies, Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   As the fight dragged on, the CIA, at the committee's
recommendation, pulled together an analysis of the impact of the
spying, reflecting the consensus of American intelligence
officials.
</P>
<P>
   On April 21, the CIA published its findings. It did not
highlight espionage as a critical element of China's effort to
improve its nuclear capabilities. It could not determine the
relative importance of espionage, openly available information and
home-grown Chinese know-how.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line,'' said a senior intelligence official, ``is
we don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did they know ``whether any weapon design documentation
or blueprints were stolen.'' The Cox committee said China may have
obtained such documents, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the CIA report agreed with the Cox committee's
central conclusion: Stolen American nuclear secrets had accelerated
the Chinese drive toward a modern arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   On April 22, the day after the CIA report was published, Cox and
Dicks got their meeting with the president and discussed the
findings of their report.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, Clinton has not repeated his earlier statements that
he was unaware of suspicions of Chinese espionage on his watch.

 &HT;    Teen breakups can be a prescription for depression and
destruction
 &HT;    EDs: For use with follow-ups on school shooting stories
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Diane Lore
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jay Bakker, a youth minister, was enjoying a midnight dinner
last week at an Atlanta restaurant when his beeper went off. It was
a teen upset about breaking up with her boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   Through her tears, she apologized for intruding so late. But
Bakker, director of Revolution - a ministry for adolescents - was
thrilled he could be there for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm only 23, so I'm not so far away from the pain these kids
feel,'' said Bakker, whose youth group is run out of Mt. Paran
SafeHouse Ministries of Atlanta. ``I remember what it was like. I
remember the stress and the agony. And I remember what it's like
not to have anyone to talk to.''
</P>
<P>
   The demise of a love affair is tough on anyone, but it can be
particularly hard on teenagers, who don't have the coping skills,
social network or the ability to control their emotions that most
adults do, child psychologists say. That volatile adolescent mix
can make a breakup a prescription for depression and destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Failed romances are believed to have played contributing roles
in several recent school shootings, including Thursday's rampage at
Heritage High School in Rockdale County in suburban Atlanta. As
investigators seek motives, it's not uncommon to find that romantic
breakups preceded these frightening blowups. For instance: _ A
Fayetteville, Tenn., honor student opened fire on his classmates
last May, killing a student who was dating his ex-girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   _ Two Jonesboro, Ark., boys, ages 11 and 13, killed four girls
and a teacher in March 1998 after they pulled a fire alarm and shot
people as they fled the building. One of the boys said he was angry
in part because he had been dumped by his girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   _ A Pearl, Miss., 16-year-old killed his mother and then shot
nine students at his high school in 1997. Two died, including his
ex-girlfriend _ who apparently was a primary target of the shooter.
</P>
<P>
   The pattern was repeated again this past week in suburban
Atlanta, where a disgruntled 15-year-old opened fire into a crowd
of students at Heritage High. Friends of the sophomore, a former
Boy Scout, said he had broken up with his girlfriend of two years
just two days before the shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically, these sorts of things happen when you have someone
who doesn't have a very strong sense of self,'' said Dr. Ken
Fleishman, a psychiatrist and medical director of Laurel Heights
Hospital, an Atlanta mental-health facility for children. ``The
person gets a lot of self esteem from the relationship. But when it
breaks up, they experience a complete loss _ not only do they lose
the relationship, but their own self-worth. And in some cases, this
causes them to get very angry and strike out.''
</P>
<P>
   But break-ups are never the sole reason for violence in the
classroom, experts say: A tapestry of factors are involved. But the
loss could either mark a teen's final severing of ties with loved
ones or be the killing blow to a child's fragile ego. More than
half of teen suicides, for example, are preceded by a troubled or
broken relationship, psychologists say. Almost 2,000 teens
committed suicide in 1996, according to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some people, break-ups make them feel all alone and
unloved,'' said Dr. Nadine Kaslow, chief psychologist at Atlanta's
Grady Health System and an Emory University professor.
</P>
<P>
   ``But adults know that won't always be the case, they have
enough experience to know they can survive this. Teens, on the
other hand, sometimes don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Teenage love affairs are nothing new, but experts say today's
lifestyles have intensified what already were a strong brew of
emotions in young people.
</P>
<P>
   A key difference: Families are more fractured than in past
generations, with some teen couples depending more on each other
than on their parents, who may be separated, divorced or simply too
busy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a big void nowadays in some family situations, '' said
Steve Richardson, a language arts teacher and basketball coach at
Parkview High School in Lilburn, noting that he knows nothing about
the Rockdale suspect's family. ``Kids are just human beings, they
want to be loved, they want to be cared for, and if they don't get
that at home, they put all their emotional eggs in one basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when it fails, it's a lot harder on them.''
</P>
<P>
   David Issa, a junior at Dunwoody High School, said some
teenagers start to depend on each other too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``It becomes a sickness,'' Issa said. ``They start isolating
themselves and only want to be with each other. And finally, they
end up warping what was a healthy relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   And teenagers are more sexually active today, which means they
may be getting in too deep too fast. There's a higher probability
that things will go awry for any number of reasons, including
unplanned pregnancy, sexually transmitted disease or simply because
one partner is less committed than the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen situations where the girl might feel obligated to
have sex, and eventually she does,'' said Tani Gaan, a senior at
McIntosh High School in Peachtree City. ``But then things break up,
and they're angry and hurt. They'll say, `Here, I gave all this up,
and now it's just over.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gaan said some teen couples magnify the problem because they
drop their friends in order to spend all their time together. ``In
those cases, they look around and find they're lost'' after a
breakup, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Almost half of high school students have had sex, according to
studies by the CDC. And that figure has risen steadily for two
decades to a record 54 percent in 1991 _ although it dropped to 48
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sexual activity at such a young age has been detrimental for
teens,'' said Lisa Terry, a Roswell counselor. ``Oftentimes, they
don't know what they're doing; they don't have the life skills to
manage it. Simply put, they're playing with toys they shouldn't be
playing with.''
</P>
<P>
   If teens are having sex, they run the risk of not only having to
deal with emotional rejection, but sexual rejection too _ and being
embarrassed about the whole thing. Unlike adults, who may keep
details of their personal lives limited to a handful of family and
friends, teens must face the scrutiny of high school, which means a
jury of hundreds. And those who fail to pass muster must find their
way at a time when they are most concerned about their image.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one, whether they're a teen or an adult, likes being made
the fool,'' said Dr. Lyndon Waugh, an Atlanta child psychiatrist
and author of ``Tired of Yelling: Teaching Our Children to Resolve
Conflict'' ($22.95, Longstreet).
</P>
<P>
   Children, meanwhile, are bombarded with images of violence _ and
not only in the media. Many learn the lessons of violence in their
own homes. In 1997, close to 1,000 women were killed by their
husbands or boyfriends, according to the Federal Bureau of
Investigation. And the FBI reports that a man beats a woman every
12 seconds in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an increasing awareness that (violence) is an action
you could potentially do,'' Waugh said. ``It's not abstract
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   What's needed, experts say, is for more adults to pay attention
to teens with broken hearts, and to respond to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teen romances really do feel like real love to the kids,''
Waugh said. ``But teens feel the adult world at times discounts the
relationships and the very real nature of their pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Too often, Bakker said, a teen's deep sadness goes undetected or
is written off as a harmless mood swing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Teens may not want to talk to their parents; after all, this
is a time they're hesitant to talk to them about anything,'' said
Dr. Tom Cummins, a pediatric psychiatrist at Emory University
School of Medicine. ``But a parent (needs to) say, `Hey are you
okay? I know you just broke up and that's got to be tough.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Parents also should point out that a shattered relationship is a
normal experience, without belittling it, experts say. And parents
can offer to let their children talk to someone else _ a counselor,
minister or family member who might give them a broader perspective
on love.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think it's the end of the world, no matter what anyone
tells you,'' Kaslow said.
</P>
<P>
   If they see certain warning signs, however, adults need to take
action beyond words. If a child's grades drop, his eating or
sleeping patterns change, and he's no longer taking calls or
hanging out with his friends, it's a warning flag. And if a teen is
talking about killing himself or others, or shows a newfound
interest in weapons, it's time for friends and family to step in
and get help.
</P>
<P>
   The Heritage High sophomore, for example, talked about killing
himself and bringing a gun to school almost a week before he shot
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a good side to all of this,'' Kaslow said of the
recent incidents, ``it's that this has been a wake-up call to many
parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Terry agrees. In her practice of two psychiatrists and three
counselors, ``things have never been busier.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that parents are far more attuned now,'' she said.
``They're finally paying attention.

NO ONE CRIES `RAT' AS OFFICERS TAKE STAND IN LOUIMA TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KEVIN FLYNN and KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Listen hard for the slurs like ``rat'' or ``cheese
eater.'' Listen again for the hissing anger that New York City
police officers often show toward colleagues who tell on their
brethren.
</P>
<P>
   It is curiously missing from the case of Abner Louima, a trial
in which four officers have come forward to testify against Officer
Justin Volpe, who is charged with torturing Louima in a Brooklyn
station house.
</P>
<P>
   There has been some muttering, for sure, about the officers who
took the stand. Detective Eric Turetzky even got a few disturbing
phone calls at night with no one on the other end. But there has
been no great chorus of disapproval directed at them, just as there
has been no great demonstration of support by fellow officers for
Officer Volpe or the four other officers indicted in the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody has a problem with them testifying,''
said a detective from Manhattan with 14 years on the job. ``In a
situation like this, these guys coming forward and stating what
they saw, and being honest, can only help the department.''
</P>
<P>
   To some, such statements suggest that the unwritten rule of
reticence so ingrained in police culture, the so-called blue wall
of silence, is beginning to fade, just as the Mafia oath of
silence, omerta, dissolved as informer after informer came forward
to break the bond.
</P>
<P>
   But in interviews in four boroughs with two dozen officers of
different ranks, many said the Louima case was so aberrant that
they did not believe the muted response to these station house
witnesses reflected any historic shift in police attitudes toward
officers who break the code of silence.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, they said the alleged assault, in which Louima says he
was sodomized with a stick, was so savage that it was difficult for
most officers to identify with those who were indicted or to summon
outrage against those who have helped prosecute them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never inform about anything petty,'' said a patrolman
in his 40s, who has spent two decades on the force and now works in
a plainclothes detail in the Bronx. ``Most cops would turn their
back on it because they don't think cops get a fair break and they
believe cops get punished more than they should. But this is such a
reprehensible, sadistic thing. This is not about protecting another
cop.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, veteran officers say they sense a change in officers'
attitudes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it different than it was 20 years ago?'' said Lt. Anthony
Garvey, president of the Lieutenants Benevolent Association. ``It
is. There seems to be more of a willingness to testify.''
</P>
<P>
   A homicide and narcotics detective, with more than 20 years on
the force, agreed as he sat on a stool inside O'Hanlon's Bar on
East 14th Street. ``Twenty years ago, maybe some of these cops
would have just walked away. But 20 years ago, this might not have
happened. Another cop would have stopped them. Somebody would have
said, `What are you, out of your mind?'''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the officers interviewed, most of whom refused to speak
without a promise of anonymity, said they were still withholding
judgment on whether the attack in the bathroom of the 70th Precinct
station house had actually happened as Louima described. ``They're
being tried in the media, and it isn't fair,'' said Officer Jesus
Aponte, outside the 76th Precinct station house in the Carroll
Gardens section of Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   But as the layers of testimony from fellow officers built upon
one another over the last two weeks, several said they were
beginning to believe that a crime had occurred.
</P>
<P>
   None of those interviewed expressed hostility toward the
officers who had testified, although few were inclined to call them
heroes. Several questioned whether the officers had come forward
because they feared that to do otherwise would have hurt their
careers or led them to be accused of withholding evidence.
</P>
<P>
   It was more than a week after Louima was hospitalized in August
1997 before some of the officers came forward under pressure from
investigators to tell what they knew. One of them, Mark Schofield,
has admitted holding back for eight days because he was too scared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fear motivated their testimony more than honesty or some
higher calling,'' said a captain assigned to an investigative job
in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   A 43-year-old lieutenant from the Bronx said: ``I don't know if
they are modern-day Frank Serpicos. They might be just guys with
promotions hanging over their heads.'' Serpico was an officer who
exposed police corruption in the late 1960s and early '70s, at the
expense of his police career.
</P>
<P>
   Turetzky, a patrolman at the time the attack is alleged to have
occurred, was transferred to the Internal Affairs Bureau after the
incident and later promoted to detective. The Police Department has
disputed any suggestion that his promotion was related to his
testimony. A third officer to testify, Kenneth Wernick, was
promoted to sergeant, based on his score on a civil service exam,
sometime after he came forward to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be very careful before we attach hero status to
them,'' said Lt. Eric Adams, co-founder of 100 Blacks in Law
Enforcement Who Care. ``For the first time in history we saw an
aggressive, strong-arm police investigation where they compelled
officers to come forward. These officers did not come forward out
of the goodness of their heart.''
</P>
<P>
   The commander of a precinct in Manhattan said he was,
nonetheless, impressed with the courage they demonstrated. ``I
don't know if it is something I could do or something that guys
with my time on the job could do,'' he said. ``You are taking a
chance of being ostracized for the rest of your career.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department insists that retaliation has decreased
significantly since the days when whistle-blowers lost friends,
received dead rats in the mail and suffered mysterious acts of
vandalism. ``This is so beyond belief that I don't perceive there
should be hard feelings against these guys,'' said a supervisor for
a squad in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   If that sentiment proves true, then the department has come a
long way in the three years since Officer Daisy Boria took the
stand and contradicted the account of her partner, Francis Livoti,
who was ultimately convicted of federal civil rights violations in
the choke-hold death of Anthony Baez in the Bronx. Officer Boria
was shunned immediately, and concerns for her well-being grew so
great, she said, that her superior officer in the 46th Precinct
checked her locker hourly for tampering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Daisy was completely ostracized,'' said Susan Karten, a lawyer
for the Baez family. ``She had to wear a bulletproof vest to come
to court. She was a completely demoralized women then and she still
is now.''
</P>
<P>
   Officer Boria's brother, Jeffrey Ramirez, said: ``Whenever you
are going against so many of your colleagues and tell the truth,
that's how it is, a lot of looking over your back and a lot of
threats. But I am very proud of her, and I think she is very proud
of these four cops who are now following in her footsteps in the
Louima case.''
</P>
<P>
   Officer Boria, a 17-year veteran of the force, is in the process
of leaving the department, according to one of her lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Baez case was a patrol incident, the type in
which officers often find a way to extend the benefit of the doubt
to their peers because they identify so closely with the pressures
of working the streets, criminal justice experts said. For similar
reasons, officers have stood squarely behind the four Bronx
officers charged in the killing of an unarmed man, Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of officers have attended rallies organized by the
Patrolmen's Benevolent Association for the officers accused in that
case. No rallies have been held for the officers accused in the
Louima case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cops want to believe that their fellow cops could not be
capable of doing such a horrible thing,'' said Lt. Donald Jirak,
president of the Gay Officers Action League. ``But with the Diallo
case, the reaction was different. Everyone was, ``Oh, that could
have been me.'''

SCHOOL VOUCHER FOES UNITE IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Wis.)   (bl)  
 By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A broad-based group of religious, civic and political
leaders has organized to fight Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's push for
publicly financed school vouchers in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The group, called the Emergency Campaign Against Vouchers,
attracted about 200 people to a conference at New York University
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Noreen Connell, an organizer of the group and executive director
of the Educational Priorities Panel, a nonprofit organization that
monitors school spending, said the campaign was trying to provide a
counterweight to the well-organized foundations supporting
vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, she said, the group hardly compares in clout and
financial resources to the forces supporting vouchers. She said the
campaign's operating money has come from small contributions,
ranging from $50 from the United Parents Association, an
organization of parents with children in public schools, to $300
from the Citizens' Committee for Children, an advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   The city teachers' union, the United Federation of Teachers, has
provided copying services and materials while spending tens of
thousands of dollars on newspaper advertising in the campaign's
name, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very sad how well coordinated, how well monied, the other
side is,'' Ms. Connell said. ``On our side, there's no
coordination. Foundations are not forthcoming, and they're not
providing money or really attempting to prevent this sort of
right-wing assault on the schools.'' The group hopes to mobilize
public opinion against vouchers through rallies and teach-ins.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of vouchers include the Bradley Foundation in
Milwaukee and the Institute for Justice in Washington, which
mounted a legal defense for Milwaukee's voucher program in state
courts.
</P>
<P>
   Several speakers at the conference contended that Giuliani had
misrepresented Milwaukee's voucher program, which he has held up as
a model for New York. The Mayor contends that Milwaukee's program
provides low-income students with an escape from failing urban
public schools without compromising the constitutionally mandated
separation of church and state or hurting the students left behind.
</P>
<P>
   One speaker, Elliot Mincberg, legal director of People for the
American Way, a Washington-based group that opposes vouchers, said
60 percent of the 6,000 students in the Milwaukee program this year
were not even from the public schools, but had gone to private
schools last year.
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, the program has drained nearly $25 million in
state aid from Milwaukee's public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overall view is that the program has, number one, hurt the
public schools, and number two, has not provided meaningful choice
for the poorest of public school students,'' Mincberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Coles, a senior adviser to Giuliani, questioned
Mincberg's analysis of the Milwaukee program, and emphasized that
under Giuliani's proposal, vouchers would be available to children
in public schools only and would go to the poorest 15 percent or 20
percent. Asked if the program would be made available to
prekindergarten pupils, who have not yet enrolled in either public
or private school, he said the grades to be included would have to
be negotiated with the City Council. But the goal, he said, was to
serve only public school students.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Fruchter, of the Institute for Education and Social
Policy at NYU, warned that the only effective way of stopping the
voucher movement was to improve the public schools. He noted that
the greatest support for vouchers had come from the parents of
inner-city schoolchildren attending failing public schools,
particularly black and Hispanic families. Support for vouchers
tends to diminish, according to polls, among suburban residents and
people with higher incomes who have access to better schools.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's proposal has drawn stiff opposition from Schools
Chancellor Rudy Crew, who has threatened to resign if it is
approved by the Board of Education. In his latest version, Giuliani
proposes to administer the program through City Hall, though it
remains unclear whether it would be financed by deducting the cost
of the vouchers from the public school budget or through a separate
revenue stream. To be enacted, the program requires City Council
approval.
</P>
<P>
   At the NYU event, state Assemblyman Steven Sanders, D-Manhattan,
and Arthur Eisenberg, legal director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, said state law prohibits city government from
making substantial decisions about the use of state education money
without the participation of the Board of Education. They also said
vouchers violate an amendment to the State Constitution that
prohibits direct or indirect public financing of schools controlled
by any religious denomination.
</P>
<P>
   Coles said the Wisconsin courts had found that vouchers could be
used for religious schools as long as parents _ not government _
chose where to use them.

REAL ESTATE: FITNESS CENTERS FOR PATIENTS AND PUBLIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By VERNE G. KOPYTOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINGMAN, Ariz. _ In an effort to make money and encourage people
to live healthier lives, the Kingman Regional Medical Center _ the
only hospital in this dusty desert town 180 miles northwest of
Phoenix _ opened a fitness center in February that follows a model
already established in hundreds of other communities in recent
years. It serves the dues-paying public as well as patients who
require physical therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the air smells of health,'' said Linda VanKirk, a
schoolteacher, who was sitting on a rowing machine in the Del E.
Webb Wellness and Rehabilitation Center, trying to catch her breath
after a workout.
</P>
<P>
   While the hospital's fitness club offers activities found in
traditional gyms, like weight lifting, there are some differences.
The clientele is, on average, older and has less athletic
experience; patients work out with therapists alongside healthy
members of the public and there are support groups for arthritics,
diabetics and alcoholics.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at the Kingman Regional Medical Center first
considered opening a so-called wellness center in 1995. At first,
they only wanted to build a cardiac rehabilitation unit. In the
end, however, they expanded the size of their plans many times
over.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons was to provide more physical therapy
equipment than was otherwise possible. Allowing the public to use
that equipment would allow the hospital to maximize its return.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor was to try to offset the low rate of
reimbursement from Medicare. It was also thought that making people
healthier would reduce the 124-bed hospital's high occupancy rate
so that seriously ill patients would be sure to have a bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of becoming defensive and building more beds, we took
the offensive and said, `Why don't we make the people healthier so
they don't need help?''' said Carla Malvick, the hospital's
spokeswoman. ``We want to target the 45-year-old who is in danger
of a heart attack so they don't come in the hospital with chest
pain.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospital executives hired a consulting company that advised them
about the complexities of opening a fitness center. Construction
proceeded after a survey showed that there was a large enough
client base to make the project successful.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the gym cost $3.5 million, of which $1 million came
from the Del E. Webb Foundation, a charitable organization that
finances health-care projects. The 35,000-square-foot facility was
built on land that the hospital already owned.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from exercise machines, the fitness center features an
indoor pool, a therapeutic pool, two racquetball courts, an indoor
basketball court, a walking track, an aerobics room, locker rooms,
steam rooms, Jacuzzi, conference room and library. The interior is
spacious and painted in the colors of a Southwest sunset.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its nonprofit mission, the gym offers reduced
membership rates for low-income people. It also plans to open the
facility to some charitable organizations free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the fitness center, which charges $41 in monthly dues
and a $100 initiation fee (including blood test, physical and
exercise prescription) for a single adult, has nearly 1,300
members. A few dozen physical therapy patients use the gym each
day.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, hospital-owned fitness centers appear to be a growing
phenomenon, with their numbers increasing from 150 in 1991 to
nearly 600 today, according to the Medical Fitness Association, the
industry's trade group.
</P>
<P>
   As is the case with Kingman, most wellness centers are situated
on the campus of their parent hospital and are built specifically
to be gyms. Some hospitals share the same building with their
wellness center.
</P>
<P>
   Robin Schuette, executive director of the Medical Fitness
Association, said that hospital-owned gyms are generally found in
small towns and suburbs, possibly because of the lower cost of real
estate than in major cities. Most are built by local hospitals or
small hospital chains.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are the hospitals that are more attuned to the needs of
the community,'' Ms. Schuette said. ``They probably don't have the
bureaucratic layers of larger hospitals, which are more concerned
with things like acquiring physician groups.''
</P>
<P>
   Though there are companies that can be hired to manage fitness
centers, most hospitals choose to do the job on their own. If a gym
is managed properly, a hospital can expect a 15 percent to 20
percent annual return on its investment, Ms. Schuette said.
</P>
<P>
   The physical therapy performed in hospital-owned fitness centers
gives the facilities a natural base from which to draw members.
Many physical therapy patients sign up as gym members after their
rehabilitation is over.
</P>
<P>
   Among them are people recovering from heart attacks, injuries
from work and arthritis. Some of the patients in Kingman, typically
elderly people who are going to a fitness center for the first time
in their lives, said they would probably not continue to exercise
if they had to switch gyms after their therapy ended.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   These patients do not appear to mind being rehabilitated with
the help of a therapist alongside regular gym members. Marilyn
Stoneberger, a sheriff's dispatcher who was getting therapy for an
injured shoulder from heavy lifting at work, said that the mix of
healthy exercisers and patients like herself ``seems to chime in
together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of gives you a little inspiration when you look at
some of these girls exercising,'' she said after working out her
arm and getting a massage from one of the therapists.
</P>
<P>
   If Kingman's wellness center is any indication, such facilities
are well received by their members. But traditional gym owners
criticize the nearly 80 percent of the wellness centers that do not
pay taxes because of their nonprofit status.
</P>
<P>
   Abraham Dehaybib, who owns the Kingman Fitness and Racquet Club
in this town of 16,000, complained that such exemptions were
unfair. He said that because of its tax advantage, Kingman's
wellness center can charge lower fees than otherwise possible and
provide more services.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the upper hand,'' Dehaybib said. ``I'm struggling to
keep my nose above water. In November and July we have to come up
with big bucks to pay taxes while they don't. I can't compete
against that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Ablondi, assistant director of government relations for the
International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub Association, which
represents for-profit health clubs, is trying to level the playing
field by encouraging legislators to change laws concerning
nonprofit organizations. He said that the Wisconsin Legislature,
for example, passed a bill in 1998 that obligated nonprofit
wellness centers to pay property taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they have rehab programs, then those types of revenues can
be tax-exempt,'' Ablondi said. ``Where the issues gets a little
heated is when they begin aggressively marketing to the healthy
part of the community. We encourage them to do that, but they
should pay taxes. That goes beyond their mission of helping the
sick.''

MANY IMMIGRANTS FIND AMERICA'S PROMISE IN THE ARMY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Okla., Texas, )   (bl)  
 By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was only four years ago that Fernando De Souza and
his family arrived here from Lima, Peru. De Souza, the eldest of
four children, scrambled to learn English at John Bowne High School
in Flushing, Queens, kept his grades in the high 80s, and dreamed
of studying medicine in college.
</P>
<P>
   But disappointments quickly tumbled in: A guidance counselor
questioned whether he could succeed in a pre-med program. And De
Souza's father, a condominium maintenance worker, could hardly
afford college tuition in any case. De Souza never bothered to
apply. Instead, he enlisted in the Army.
</P>
<P>
   De Souza, 17, plans to head off to basic training in Oklahoma by
summer's end, and after training hopes to join an artillery unit.
It was not the lure of being a soldier that changed his mind _ it
was the regular paycheck and the Army's promise of $19,000 for
college. De Souza plans to send his first few paychecks _ $800 a
month _ back home to help his family with the rent. He hopes to
take college courses near the Army base and eventually graduate
from the Brooklyn campus of Long Island University.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like shooting people and stuff like that,'' De Souza
said. ``I thought I had to work for college, pay for my education.
I didn't think I was going to be able to take that. That's why I
thought the Army was the best decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Because many more high school graduates have been heading
directly to college or landing jobs in New York City's booming
economy in recent years, military recruiters say that persuading
young men and women to enlist is harder than ever. But for more and
more immigrants, even legal residents who are not yet citizens, the
military has come to represent a step up the American social
ladder, much as it has long been for working-class youths born
here.
</P>
<P>
   At the Army station in Flushing, where De Souza signed up,
officials estimate that half the recruits today are immigrants _
youngsters from India and Korea, Jamaica and Guyana. About a third
of the recruits from New York City, where 13 percent of the
children under 18 were born outside the United States, hold green
cards.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, the percentage of immigrants in the Army is still
small: about 5 percent last year, up from 2 percent a decade ago.
But Army officials say they believe that the children of
immigrants, too, are enlisting in greater numbers. Since they do
not keep statistics on immigrants who are naturalized citizens,
that belief is supported not by hard numbers but by anecdotal
evidence and by inference based on such signs as the growth in the
percentage of Hispanic soldiers. More than 10 percent of the
roughly 70,000 recruits in fiscal year 1998, for instance, were
Hispanic, up from 4 percent in 1987. Army Secretary Louis Caldera
is himself the Texas-born son of Mexican immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   At the Flushing station, Hojin Pak, 17, a Korean-American who
immigrated at age 4, said he signed up for the Army because his
parents could not afford to send him to the State University of New
York at Buffalo, where he had been accepted. In the fall, he will
be stationed in Virginia and work as a logistics specialist. He
said he hoped that his stint would help pay for college and earn
him a measure of self-confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Amos Dobrowski, who was born in Poland before the fall of
communism, said he enlisted because he did not want to subject his
parents to financial hardship. In exchange for $50,000 for college,
Dobrowski, 17, who once dreamed of going to culinary school, has
agreed to a four-year assignment in Fort Hood, Texas, where he will
be a tank gunner.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Rodriguez, a Dominican immigrant at John Bowne High
School who wanted to study law at George Washington University,
said she signed up because no one else was offering what Sgt. Marc
Ross, a recruiter in the Flushing station, did: $50,000 for
college.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   So Ms. Rodriguez, a strong-willed, serious 17-year-old with a
delicate coif of curls, will spend the next four years as an Army
chemical operations specialist, testing for toxic chemicals on the
battlefield and, she hopes, attending evening classes at a college
near her base.
</P>
<P>
   Talking to Ross one afternoon earlier this year ``opened a whole
new world,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It is that glimpse of opportunity, Ross said, that explains the
Army's appeal to young people _ not only to native New Yorkers like
him, but also to the immigrants of Queens. As he trolls for
potential recruits, he peppers them with questions: Do you have any
major health problems? Are you a high school graduate?
</P>
<P>
   And then he adds: Were you born in this country? If not, do you
have a green card?
</P>
<P>
   The sergeant, a jovial, fast-talking man with a close military
haircut and a pencil-thin mustache, grew up in Bushwick, Brooklyn,
and now lives with his wife and their three sons on the Army base
in Fort Hamilton, Brooklyn. When he was the age of his young
immigrant recruits, Ross, 30, said, his world was actually not all
that different from theirs. He was not exactly brimming with
patriotic fervor as a teen-ager. All he wanted after high school
was a good job and a way to provide for his girlfriend, now his
wife. When a recruiter told him that the Army could help him do
just that, he signed up.
</P>
<P>
   He said he often wondered how many of his old friends were in
jail, or dead. He still sees some of them hanging out on street
corners, he said, and his conversations with them usually go like
this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Why don't you join the Army?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, man, I don't want to join the Army,'' they reply. ``You
got $20?''
</P>
<P>
   Today, even though the Army is smaller than it was a decade ago,
finding soldiers has never been harder, recruiters said. In New
York City, they said, it has become harder to attract young people
with a high school diploma (the Army can take a few with only
equivalency degrees) and without a criminal record. Even among high
school graduates, finding applicants who can pass the military
entrance exam is a formidable challenge, recruiters said.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the challenge of competing with the lure of a
college education. Compared with previous generations, many more
high school graduates are going to college. One recent morning Ross
went recruiting at La Guardia Community College. On campus, Ross
passed a young man dressed in camouflage pants. ``You want the
whole suit?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nah,'' came the nonchalant reply.
</P>
<P>
   Ross pointed to a table where young men were playing cards.
``That's what college is all about _ playing,'' he said, barely
hiding his contempt.
</P>
<P>
   Down the hall, he ran into Brandon Baxter, a student he has been
trying to recruit for months, and resumed the hard sell.
</P>
<P>
   Deeply ambivalent about joining the Army, Baxter, 20, is
ambitious and thoughtful. He said he wanted to be like billionaire
investor Warren Buffett. ``Rich people inspire me,'' he said.
``Maybe 'cause I'm broke.''
</P>
<P>
   Ross reminded Baxter that the Army was a $64 billion business,
and that jobs in finance were available to candidates like him.
</P>
<P>
   Baxter told Ross that he wanted to move out of his mother's
apartment and was thinking about taking the Army test soon. Ross
pressed him to act before it was too late _ before he ended up with
a criminal record. Baxter insisted that he was not involved in
criminal activity. Ross simply shrugged and reminded him of Amadou
Diallo. ``He probably wasn't into anything, either,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ross is much like his recruits in focusing on the security of
Army life, rather than its rigors. Many of the young men and women
who have signed up at the Flushing recruiting station say they give
little thought to the dangers they may face in the Army or the
violence of combat.
</P>
<P>
   De Souza, for instance, said that even though his mother cried
for him every time she saw television reports about the war in
Yugoslavia, he was confident that he would not be in danger. ``I'm
not scared about that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Assembled at the recruiting station one afternoon last week, the
newest recruits from Flushing reflected on the lives they will be
starting soon.
</P>
<P>
   Lnu Geevarghese, 18, an Indian immigrant, said he knew that
combat could be part of the bargain. ``It's your job to defend,''
he said. ``Obviously, you have to be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   That evening, Dobrowski said the war in Yugoslavia had prompted
him to think long and hard about serving the U.S. government. He
became a U.S. citizen two years ago. ``I'm seeing it as another
Holocaust,'' he said. ``It's good they're helping the people.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was also a bit cynical about the U.S. military action.
``From history,'' said Dobrowski, who plans to major in the
subject, ``I see they get interested where they have an interest.''

IF YOU'RE TALKING SWEEP, THE KNICKS AREN'T LISTENING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Chris Childs stormed out of the New York Knicks'
practice facility at SUNY-Purchase on Friday, flying past reporters
as if they were the Atlanta Hawks in transition defense. Asked to
give enlightenment on the Knicks' playoff performance, and perhaps
speak a word or two about the probability of advancing to the
Eastern Conference finals, the second-unit point guard kept quiet
and kept walking.
</P>
<P>
   You would have thought his Knicks were the ones trailing, two
games to none, in their conference semifinal series with the Hawks.
Had Childs been reminded that these are actually good times for the
Knicks, he might have put his hands over his ears and sped along
even faster.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into Sunday's Game 3 at Madison Square Garden, Childs
and his teammates are trying to forget about the 2-0 lead that
leaves them only two straight games worth of ball movement away
from an impressive sweep of Atlanta. The Knicks want the mind-set
of a desperate team fighting for a final playoff spot, of one
striving for redemption from a tumultuous regular season. After
all, that is the kind of thinking that has led to their vast
improvement and put them on a collision course with the Indiana
Pacers in what teases to be a suspenseful conference championship
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't think about the fact that we're up, 2-0,'' said
Knicks starting forward Kurt Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to be up two-zip,'' said Knicks assistant coach Don
Chaney. ``It puts an unbelievable amount of pressure on Atlanta.
But I don't even want to think sweep right now.''
</P>
<P>
   While fans and analysts are preparing for yet another momentous
matchup between the Knicks and the Pacers, who hold a 3-0 lead in
their semifinal series with the Philadelphia 76ers, the Knicks are
studying their history and hoping not to repeat it. Just moments
after the Knicks all but buried the Hawks by winning their second
game in Atlanta, Coach Jeff Van Gundy brought up the 1993 playoffs,
when the Knicks won the first two games over the Chicago Bulls only
to lose the next four.
</P>
<P>
   There was also the infamous series with Miami two years ago,
when the Knicks wasted a 3-1 lead and fell in seven games to the
Heat. But those were special circumstances. Patrick Ewing's career
nemesis, Michael Jordan, was playing for Chicago when the Bulls
aborted the Knicks' seemingly certain trip to the NBA finals. And
against Miami, Ewing, Allan Houston, Larry Johnson, John Starks and
Charlie Ward were suspended for one or both of the final two games
for their part in the Game 5 brouhaha between Ward and Miami's P.J.
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more appropriate admonitions would be the 1994 series
with Chicago and Indiana, when the Knicks grabbed 2-0 leads over
both clubs before staggering to victory in seven games. And the
Bulls were without Jordan at the time. That was the last time the
Knicks advanced past the second round of the playoffs, something
they seem to be on the verge of doing for only the third time this
decade. But they don't want to hear that.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't feel too confident right now,'' Houston said. ``You
still have to take it one game at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   While the caution is appreciated, Atlanta does not appear
capable of endangering the Knicks in this series. The Hawks' status
as one of the best road teams in the league was clouded by their
two convincing first-round losses in Detroit. Moreover, the Knicks
played poorly in dispatching of Hawks by 77-70 in Game 2. It is as
true as it is discouraging that the Knicks are inconsistent, apt to
be brilliant one night and inept the next. But if their irritating
pattern continues, they will play well Sunday. In Game 2, the
Knicks' starters brought little, shooting 32 percent from the floor
and being outrebounded by 46-24. Houston, who blitzed the Hawks for
34 points in Game 1, scored only 2 points. And Ewing, clearly
slowed by his aching left Achilles' in Game 2, should be stronger
Sunday after getting two days of rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we didn't play the way we really wanted to play but we
have confidence,'' said Thomas, who managed only 1 point and 3
rebounds in Game 2. ``We're coming home and we want to have a good
outcome back in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks, owners of the second-best home record in the Eastern
Conference, have a 32-13 record in playoff games at Madison Square
Garden in the 1990's.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to take care of business and win your home games, in
which case we would sweep,'' center Chris Dudley said. ``But you
have to be real careful and not have a letdown.''
</P>
<P>
   REBOUNDS
</P>
<P>
   If LATRELL SPREWELL and MARCUS CAMBY, the stars of the Knicks'
Game 2 victory, are feeling a sense of vindication for their
post-season play, they are keeping it to themselves. Sprewell, who
has scored 62 points in the two victories over Atlanta, was said to
be able to put up such numbers only on a losing team. ``I don't
really care what people say,'' Sprewell said. ``I'm just playing my
game.''
</P>
<P>
   While it is now doubtful that anyone would trade CHARLES
OAKLEY's rugged hustle for Camby's high-flying athleticism, the
young forward was castigated earlier in the season for not being
Oakley. ``Some people are going to rip me no matter what, so it
really doesn't matter,'' Camby said. ``I just go out there and try
to be myself.'' &QL;

BASKETBALL NOTEBOOK: THE TRAVAILS OF PENNY HARDAWAY; OAKLEY LOOKS
AHEAD; EVALUATING GRUNFELD 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anfernee Hardaway decided he was being disrespected by the
Orlando Magic again last week, treated badly by a franchise that
has merely acquiesced to his every demand since 1995. The fussy
Hardaway, grumpy and fed up, said he would exercise an option in
his contract to move to another team in the off-season.
</P>
<P>
   Poor Penny. It was not enough that he engineered the firing of
the former coach Brian Hill in 1997, and that he did not have the
conviction to admit it afterward. Or that he felt so disconnected
from the current Magic coach, Chuck Daly, this past season that he
needed assurances from Daly that he was still a special player.
</P>
<P>
   You could look at this development as the final blow to the
Magic, an organization unable to capture its form from the NBA
finals four years ago. But that may be shortsighted, given that
Orlando has stocked its cupboard with capable young players and
appears to be on the verge of getting better.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, Hardaway's declaration may just be the latest example of
pro basketball's losing another bright, young star to petulance. He
is in a sense the first casualty of the post-Michael Jordan era, a
player with all the tools and talent to carry the torch, but unable
to do so because of his insecurities.
</P>
<P>
   If the star point guard's stance is another power play to make
Daly step down and force the Magic to give him what he wants, you
only hope management lets him go this time. Since his defining
moment in Game 7 of the 1995 Eastern Conference finals _ the day
Hardaway and Shaquille O'Neal stood atop the basketball world after
knocking off the Indiana Pacers _ he has led the Magic to a 3-14
record in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Included in that mark is a first-round loss in four games to
Philadelphia this month, a series dominated by a more resilient and
talented point guard, Allen Iverson.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando should have seen this coming. It's not the first time
that Hardaway has wanted out or shown that he does not particularly
care for his teammates. This is the former franchise player who
rehabilitated an injury specifically to play in the All-Star Game
last season at Madison Square Garden, then deserted the Magic for
the rest of the season and flew to Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond firing Hill, the Magic has made numerous concessions to
keep Hardaway happy.
</P>
<P>
   One day last season, the former Magic reserve Derek Harper got
into a profane, trash-talking duel with Hardaway after dominating
him on the floor during and after practice. Hardaway became so
enraged and upset that he told a Magic public-relations employee to
go to his office for statistics showing how Hardaway had outscored
and outplayed Harper when the latter was with the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway later complained to management that players were
guarding him too tightly in practice. Harper was summoned by
general manager John Gabriel and was chastised for being too hard
on Hardaway. Take it easy on Penny, he's fragile, Harper was
essentially told.
</P>
<P>
   Grant Hill last season compared living up to Michael Jordan's
legacy with living up to Muhammad Ali's legacy. He called it ``The
Larry Holmes Syndrome.'' Hill drew parallels between himself,
O'Neal and Hardaway and the former heavyweight boxing champion who
just happened to succeed the Greatest.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all suffer from it,'' Hill said. ``We can't be Mike, so
many of us will never be appreciated for the players we were _ just
as people never truly appreciated Larry Holmes for his dominance.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardaway never had to be the next Jordan. He could have merely
been an all-star who eventually matured into a great player. With
each new petty grievance he airs, he gives new meaning to Little
Penny, his diminutive alter-ego on TV commercials. Little Penny, it
appears, has a long way to go before he grows up.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley Mulls His Future
</P>
<P>
   Charles Oakley is not saying whether he will re-sign with the
Toronto Raptors, but the chances are beginning to look slim. With
Gary Payton's agent imploring the Seattle SuperSonics to acquire
Oakley and Bill Walton singing his praises on NBC, suitors are
already lining up for him.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley, 34, was offered a $12 million, three-year deal by the
Raptors earlier this season, but he considered the opening bid
insulting enough to make it public.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for Oakley is, Toronto can pay him more to play
power forward than any other team.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news is, the clubs with enough salary cap room to pay
him handsomely include the Los Angeles Clippers and the Chicago
Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charles may really surprise people where he ends up because of
having different priorities in his life and career,'' Billy
Diamond, Oakley's business manager, said. ``He's financially
secure. He doesn't need to make money. People tell me, `You mean,
he would turn down $8 million from Toronto to get a ring?' Look,
money plays a small factor in Charles' decision-making.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many veterans, Oakley will probably not sign with another
team until late this summer. Though teams can begin negotiating
with free agents on July 1, contracts cannot be signed until after
Aug. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to explore situations, find out who's drafted, who's
coaching and what free agents they're going to sign before
committing,'' Diamond said. ``Charles wants to be a part of a good
situation. He's not ruling out Toronto, but he is keeping his
options open.''
</P>
<P>
   Bottom Line on Grunfeld
</P>
<P>
   The temptation is to paint Ernie Grunfeld as a martyr, a deposed
general manager who was wronged after putting together the key
components of a Knick team headed full-steam toward the Eastern
Conference finals for the first time in five years.
</P>
<P>
   Relieved of his duties as team president with eight games left
in the regular season, Grunfeld is watching his vision of an
open-court, uptempo team come to life in the playoffs. His recent
acquisitions _ Latrell Sprewell and Marcus Camby _ are sparkling
against Atlanta, and his roster additions from three years ago _
Allan Houston, Larry Johnson and Chris Childs _ all played huge
roles in knocking off the Miami Heat in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   Grunfeld should be accorded approval for assembling the parts of
a team that finally rejuvenated itself, even though the Knicks may
not advance to the NBA finals this season, their stated goal.
</P>
<P>
   But to canonize his efforts now would be to overlook his obvious
shortcomings _ and to dismiss the actual reason Dave Checketts, the
Madison Square Garden president and a longtime friend of
Grunfeld's, made the decision to replace him last month.
</P>
<P>
   By failing to upgrade the point-guard position and weakening the
team at power forward in the off-season, Grunfeld set the team up
for imminent destruction against physical and poised Indiana in the
next round.
</P>
<P>
   And, other than a congenial ``How's everything?'' Grunfeld had
no relationship to speak of with many of the players. That made it
impossible for him to recognize and remedy the controversies that
gradually engulfed the team this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people criticize what I did, but I did what was in
the best interests of the organization,'' Grunfeld said last week.
``I still feel very good about it. And now it's starting to come
around. And people are starting to see why I made the decisions I
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Relieving Grunfeld of his duties may have been premature. But
whether the move was made during the season or afterward, he was
not going to make another key personnel move, however necessary,
for the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   That fact had little do with how he evaluated talent and
everything to do with his inability to comprehend his own
shortcomings.

NYC COUNCIL SAYS IT MUST CURB TAX CUT PLANS DUE TO END OF COMMUTER
LEVY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ City Council leaders announced Saturday that the
state Legislature's repeal of the commuter tax had forced them to
abandon proposals for at least $443 million in tax cuts for city
residents, including $173 million worth of cuts proposed by Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders said they had withdrawn plans to reduce the
commercial rent tax and several other business taxes, as well as
proposals to cut taxes paid by first-time home buyers. They also
said the Council had rejected Giuliani's proposals to eliminate the
sales tax on books, construction materials and clothing that costs
more than $110, which would have saved taxpayers about $113 million
a year.
</P>
<P>
   Council Speaker Peter Vallone said he and Giuliani had no choice
but to sharply curtail their tax cut plans, because the commuter
tax repeal would cost the city $360 million in revenue next year
and $400 million in 2001. The speaker and the mayor are negotiating
a budget agreement, and say they hope to adopt a plan by early
June.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had worked for close to six months on coming together on a
tax reduction package which would spur the economy,'' Vallone said
Saturday in a news conference at City Hall, where Council members
met to discuss the impact of the commuter tax repeal on Giuliani's
$35.3 billion spending plan. ``Now we have to, in 15 days, figure
out how to readjust the entire budget.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Vallone and Giuliani said that despite the repeal, they
still hoped to eliminate the sales tax on clothing that costs less
than $110 and to provide a tax credit worth $48 million for the
working poor. Other tax cut proposals that are still under
consideration include a property tax reduction for owners of
condominiums and co-ops, worth $166 million, and a tax credit for
families who pay for child care, worth $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   While the mayor and the Council usually negotiate a budget
agreement together, the Council has the power to adopt a budget
without the mayor's consent. But Joseph Lhota, the deputy mayor for
operations, indicated Saturday that the Giuliani administration
would probably not fight the Council's plan to abandon nearly half
of Giuliani's $405 million tax cut package.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their proposals are not inconsistent with what we are
discussing during our negotiations,'' Lhota said. ``We believe that
we will have a successful conclusion to our budget discussions and
move forward with adopting a budget in June.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Vallone also said Saturday that they hoped to restore
the $165 million in cuts in city programs and services that
Giuliani had proposed. But they said such restorations would be
more difficult than usual because of the unexpected loss of the
commuter tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Vallone said that with a record $2.1 billion
city surplus, he and the mayor would almost certainly not resort to
layoffs or further cuts in programs and services this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's highly unlikely that we are going to do anything that is
going to inflict unnecessary damage on the people of New York
City,'' he said.

N.Y. COLUMN: CITY'S ARTISTS ARE ITS PRIDE, AND A PAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By IVER PETERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEEKSKILL, N.Y. _ This old river city made a pretty good living
in the last century as a factory and shipping town, but by the
start of this decade the factories and the ships were long gone,
and all that remained was a dying downtown and a declining
population.
</P>
<P>
   Then somebody had an idea: artists!
</P>
<P>
   Artists are a kind of pilot fish for gentrification, the City
Council reasoned. They like cheap lodging, they aren't fussy about
their surroundings, and yet they attract flocks of big spenders. No
pushy billionaire ever bothered the fishermen and potato farmers of
the East End of Long Island until artists started moving there at
the turn of the century. Soho did not even have a name, let alone
languid connoisseurs in expensive black clothes, until artists
discovered its industrial lofts.
</P>
<P>
   But artists also bring their prickly politics, as Peekskill's
City Council has learned in the 10 years of success in luring
dozens of painters and sculptors to the city's specially zoned Arts
District.
</P>
<P>
   It was a group of artists who tried last fall to change the name
of North Division Street to Paul Robeson Street, to honor the
singer whose concerts 50 years ago in nearby Cortlandt were
famously disrupted by racist rioters. Artists, too, are at the core
of a group that has protested loudly at recent Council meetings to
keep the city from installing police surveillance cameras at
downtown intersections. The city says there has been drug dealing
there, but Georgia Svolos, a sculptor who moved here from
Manhattan's Lower East Side five years ago, says she smells racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The town council wants to gentrify Peekskill, and they want to
do it by pandering to the fears of the white people they are trying
to attract,'' said Ms. Svolos, who is white and a grandmother.
``They feel that fear of violence, a k a fear of blacks, is keeping
people away, so they want to put cameras on Main Street to make the
blacks make themselves invisible.''
</P>
<P>
   Peekskill Mayor Frances Gibbs said the anticamera insurgents are
a minority, and if she has any regrets about inviting them to
Peekskill, she isn't saying.
</P>
<P>
   Peekskill has about 60 artists at work now _ there will be an
``open studios'' day for visitors on Saturday _ and its reviving
downtown is ``like a cross between Mayberry and the Bronx,'' as
Lynne Nayman, a real estate agent, puts it. But unlike the Bronx,
Peekskill has not elected a Democratic mayor or Council member
since before a young Republican comer named George Pataki became
mayor in 1981, and this may have widened the gap between city
officials and protesters, who use ``Republican'' as a
self-explanatory slur.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Svolos was recently arrested, with Valerie Courreges, a
multimedia artist, and Nick Mottern, a carpenter and member of a
vegetarian restaurant collective, for violating the city's new
rules on addressing the council. A ``Cookies for Court Costs'' bake
sale last weekend raised $148.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Courreges, who came from Brooklyn, sees Peekskill's plan for
public cameras in the light of 19th-century prison design and
20th-century deconstructionist philosophy. ``Foucault wrote about
how architecture and design are made to surveil and control
people,'' she said. ``To me, the cameras are the technological
equivalent of Jeremy Bentham's panopticon _ it is like bringing the
prisons to the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Svolos said her group had collected 150 signatures opposing
the cameras, but on the streets there was considerable support for
them. ``I've seen things get worse since I got here,'' said Anthony
Soto, who works for the Veterans Administration and moved to
Peekskill from Manhattan's 110th Street and Lexington Avenue two
years ago. ``I think the cameras are a good idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Mucci, who recently opened Vintage Hudson Realty at Main
and North Division Streets, where one camera would go, is also in
favor. ``We're working very hard to create a historic district and
to promote business, and to attract people we need to get some of
those people off the streets,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters do not represent all of the arts community, said
Larry D'Amico, a painter. ``There are plenty of artists who are
opposed to the cameras,'' he said, ``but they are also opposed to
the tactics of this radical clique.''

GOP GOES ALL OUT IN SPECIAL RACE FOR KEY STATE SENATE SEAT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki has never publicly supported a
mandate that insurers cover infertility treatments, and his aides
say they do not even know his position on the idea. But several
Orthodox Jewish leaders in Rockland County say the governor spoke
favorably about it when he met privately with them to seek their
backing for the Republican in Tuesday's special election for the
state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brought it up and said he would be supportive of it,'' said
Rabbi Moshe David Tendler, who heads the Community Synagogue in
Monsey, the largest Orthodox congregation in the county. ``It's a
real issue in our community, because children are so important.
Having 10 children does not raise an eyebrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the governor could not confirm that he had endorsed the
mandate, which is contained in several bills before the
Legislature, but such a declaration would be notable, particularly
because Senate Republican Majority Leader Joseph Bruno has
expressed serious reservations about mandating coverage for costly
treatments like in vitro fertilization.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting between the governor and Orthodox Jewish leaders
last Sunday exemplified how, factions in the 38th state Senate
District say, powerful Republicans have romanced, cajoled, tempted
and even threatened them to win support for their candidate, Thomas
Morahan over Democrat Kenneth Zebrowski. As Bruno, said recently,
``We're pulling out all the stops.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for the parties to go all out in a race in a
swing district, particularly since the Republican edge in the
Senate is less than overwhelming at 35 to 25. Bruno and Morahan
have been blunt about their main pitch to voters: that as the
majority party in the Senate, they can deliver more pork-barrel
spending to the district, which encompasses all of Rockland and
part of Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the Senate has approved a school transportation bill
that would channel about $4 million to the East Ramapo schools, a
measure cited by Bruno as an example of the Republicans' ability to
provide for the district.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats and others say the brand of hardball being played
in this race is tougher than usual. Leaders of labor unions in
particular, all of them speaking on condition of anonymity, charge
that prominent Republicans _ especially Bruno, his colleagues and
his aides _ have implied or made outright threats that if the
unions endorse or work for Zebrowski, the bills they want to see
passed in Albany will die.
</P>
<P>
   Bruno declined to be interviewed about such claims. A spokesman
for the Senate Republicans, John McArdle, said: ``That is total
nonsense being pitched by Democrats. It sounds like the Democrats
already conceding defeat. No one is making any threats.''
</P>
<P>
   Unions are among the biggest lobbying groups and campaign
contributors in the state. They frequently seek bills for things
like increased pensions and union wage requirements on certain
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Several building trades unions have been lobbying the Pataki
administration, so far without success, to require that union labor
be used on projects at Stewart Airport in Newburgh.
</P>
<P>
   A leader of one union said: ``What we're being told is, `You
support Zebrowski, and the lines of communication will be cut, to
the Senate, to the governor's office.'''
</P>
<P>
   An official of another union said that people close to Bruno and
Pataki ``let us know that backing Zebrowski, we weren't likely to
see our bills get through.'' A union lobbyist said such threats are
not even necessary. ``It's understood, you want help that might be
a heavy lift, you don't work against them.''
</P>
<P>
   Laborers' Union Local 754 endorsed Zebrowski, but the statewide
union remained neutral and made a contribution to Morahan. The
union has been seeking to close loopholes in state laws requiring
that prevailing union wages be paid on state projects.
</P>
<P>
   The Civil Service Employees Association local representing
Rockland County employees endorsed Zebrowski. But then the union's
Region 3 council, representing 55 locals in the Hudson Valley,
voted to rescind that endorsement and back Morahan. The statewide
union, now in talks with the Pataki administration on a new
contract, supported that decision.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Harnett, a lobbyist in Albany for the Laborers' Union,
and Carmine DiBattista, Region 3 president of the CSEA, insisted
that Republicans did not apply any pressure to reverse those
endorsements, but other union officials dispute that account.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate seat was left vacant by Joseph Holland, a Republican
who earlier this year became Rockland County's social services
commissioner. Each side says it will spend at least $400,000, a
high figure for a legislative contest, though the race began in
earnest just four weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent full campaign finance statements filed with the
state Board of Elections show that Morahan's campaign had collected
$39,000 as of May 10. Of that, $30,000 came from the Senate
Republican Campaign Committee, which also spent $94,000 on his
campaign indirectly. The Republican State Committee spent $50,000
on the race, records show. Supplementary filings show that the
Senate Republican Campaign Committee raised almost $100,000 on May
18 and May 20, much of which, officials said, would go to Morahan's
effort.
</P>
<P>
   Zebrowski's filings show he had raised just $39,000 by May 10.
The Senate Democratic Campaign Committee reported spending $94,000
on his behalf, but did not report any significant fund-raising in
the last week. The Democratic State Committee reported no spending
on the race.

BRAZIL'S FEMALE SOCCER PLAYERS GAIN RESPECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ Luis Miguel Estevao had what seemed an
impossible mission. Even in Brazil, where soccer is a secular
religion, women who wanted to play were often met with closed minds
instead of open arms.
</P>
<P>
   It was Estevao's job to build the Brazilian women into a power
rivaling the Brazilian men, who have won four world championships.
He might as well have been asked to open a ski resort in Alabama.
At the first Women's World Cup in 1991, Brazil was a distant ninth
to the Americans. Brazil did not field a real team, Estevao said,
``just a bunch of people who got together with no preparation.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Estevao gathered the top women's club teams and
organized a national championship of Brazil in the southern city of
Arceburgo. One of the local priests, Estevao said, went on strike,
closed his church and said he would not say Mass as long as the
women's tournament was in progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that soccer was a men's sport and that if women
played, they were trying to be like men,'' recalled Estevao, the
general manager of the women's national team.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly, though, the cultural barriers began to splinter. When
Brazil was host to Argentina for the 1995 South American
championships, Estevao said, 80,000 fans attended the match. A year
later, Brazil finished fourth at the 1996 Summer Olympics. In 1997,
it defeated the United States for the first time. Nothing brings
legitimacy quicker than success.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 Women's World Cup does not begin until June 19, but the
Brazilians have already arrived to play a series of preparatory
matches that began Saturday night against the Americans at the
Citrus Bowl. The Brazilian women now have the corporate backing of
Nike and Coca-Cola, the support of the top men's club teams and
salaries that can reach $6,000 to $8,000 a month for the top
players.
</P>
<P>
   The stated goal for Brazil is not to win the 16-team World Cup,
but rather to reach the quarterfinals, guaranteeing a spot in the
2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney, Australia. But the players and the
coaches want much more. Brazilian soccer comes with expectations
the way shirts come with collars.
</P>
<P>
   Told that the Americans are concerned about the Brazilians, whom
they could meet July 4 in the semifinals at Stanford Stadium, the
star forward Katia said: ``In the past, the U.S. would step on the
field and they knew they would beat us. We respect them, but now
they have to respect us as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Katia, 22, was a South American hurdling champion when officials
approached her before the 1995 Women's World Cup and asked her to
play soccer full time. She declined until the Brazilian soccer
federation offered to match her track and field earnings. In the
past three seasons, the tall, lean striker has scored 132 goals for
Sao Paulo in the Brazilian league.
</P>
<P>
   Another of Brazil's top forwards, Roseli, will miss the World
Cup with a knee injury. Also missing from the roster is Michael
Jackson, nicknamed after the pop star. ``She didn't really look
like Michael Jackson,'' joked Julie Foudy, the American co-captain,
who has played against her, ``but she did wear one glove.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian women play soccer the way the men do, to a samba
beat, possessing the ball as if it is tethered to their feet. Only
200,000 girls and women officially play soccer in Brazil, compared
with 7.5 million registered female players in the United States.
But Brazilian officials are so committed to developing the women's
game that 50 scouts now comb the favelas, or slums, of Rio and Sao
Paulo, looking for the top female players, according to Tony
DiCicco, coach of the American team.
</P>
<P>
   ``In other countries, they are saying: `Soccer is our national
sport. Why are we so far behind? Why are the Americans as good as
they are? We need to change that. We need to put more resources
into it,''' DiCicco said. ``A perfect example is Brazil. Brazil
doesn't want to be second in soccer to anyone, in any gender, any
age.''
</P>
<P>
   There are soccer schools for girls now in Brazil, soccer
officials said. The girls attend classes in the morning and play
soccer in the afternoon. Several players on the national team said
they had grown up playing in the streets with their brothers and
that the prejudices against women seemed to fade for good after
Brazil's strong showing in the 1996 Summer Olympics. When they
appear in public, people recognize them and stop them for
autographs, just as they stop the men.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since the Olympics, women's soccer is like any other sport,''
Pretinha, a forward, said. ``It's not like it used to be. I never
have any problems. People are always respectful.''
</P>
<P>
   To a point. It is said that everyone in Brazil is a coach. And
while soccer is the favorite sport, the second-favorite sport is
criticizing soccer. Wilson Oliveira Rica, the good-humored women's
coach, knows it is only a matter of time before, in the eyes of
Brazilian fans, he will be able to do nothing right, only wrong. It
is the inevitable price of progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be a lot of expectation and criticism,'' he said
with a smile. ``That is part of soccer.''  &QL;

THE GIULIANI WAY: SUE AND BE SUED, AND SOMETIMES WIN BY LOSING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BRUCE LAMBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Most people dread going to court, but not Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani. He has repeatedly demonstrated during his five
years at City Hall that he loves a legal battle.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has sued people ranging from street artists to
President Clinton, to cite two cases he appealed all the way to the
U.S. Supreme Court. He won the suit against the president but lost
his case against the artists.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, Giuliani loses. Why, then, does he sue _
and get sued _ so often?
</P>
<P>
   Both supporters and critics cite several reasons, from his
contentious style and reluctance to compromise on his policies to
his prior career as a prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Detractors say he uses litigation to thwart other public
officials from doing their jobs and to suppress dissent by curbing
protest and making records inaccessible.
</P>
<P>
   Allies of the mayor say that as an innovative Republican, he has
to be litigious to defend policy changes unpopular with traditional
Democrats in a Democratic town.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is his combative personality _ perhaps the
strongest factor, in the view of those who have studied his record.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all part of the mix, but at the core is his
personality,'' said Burt Neuborne, who teaches law at New York
University. ``It's his biggest strength and biggest weakness.'' As
for the losses, ``it means he's pushing the envelope.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, the mayor has vowed to go to court again to nullify the
state Legislature's repeal of the city's commuter tax for New York
state residents. Several legal scholars have predicted that the
courts will reject his argument.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Giuliani has scored some major triumphs. The U.S.
Supreme Court upheld his zoning limits on X-rated businesses. It
also struck down the president's power to veto single budget items,
thus restoring $2.6 billion in Medicaid money to the city.
</P>
<P>
   And Wednesday, a state judge upheld the mayor's new policy of
seizing the cars of people arrested on drunken driving charges.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the mayor, who declined to be interviewed for this
article, has had far more defeats than victories, the latest in the
state's highest tribunal, the Court of Appeals. In March, the court
ruled that his effort to sell Coney Island Hospital was illegal,
and in April it ruled that he had broken the law in ousting state
auditors from city agencies. Both decisions against his
administration were unanimous, as were lower court rulings.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the biggest loser in the history of the mayoralty,'' said
Dr. Richard C. Wade, a City University historian of city legal
affairs. ``He even tried to keep people off the City Hall steps.
Now, no other mayor would ever have gone to court about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's aides defend his record, noting that he takes on
difficult causes, like revamping welfare and merging police
agencies, and that he has settled decades-long cases over managing
the jails and homeless shelters. They say that what critics really
oppose is not his legal tactics but his policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you try to change things in New York, it's not surprising
that you get sued, because the city has always tried to govern by
consensus, and what Mayor Giuliani has tried to do is shake things
up,'' said Paul Crotty, who served for four years as his
corporation counsel, the city's chief lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   An editor at City Journal, a magazine that is published by the
generally conservative Manhattan Institute and is generally
supportive of the mayor, said that Giuliani generates litigation
because ``he's willing to challenge the status quo'' and ``move
outside liberal establishment parameters.'' Innovators are often
overruled by the courts, said the editor, William J. Stern. ``FDR
is an excellent analogy.''
</P>
<P>
   Once a rarely used tactic in City Hall politics, filing lawsuits
is now a standard approach. In the last year, the mayor has fought
in court with the state comptroller, the public advocate, the
Independent Budget Office and the City Council. A budget impasse
two years ago ended up in court, and the Council was on the brink
of suing the mayor to break last year's deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor ``revels in that reputation'' for battling in court,
said the Council's chief lawyer, Richard Weinberg. Other litigation
is pending between the mayor and the Council. After spending
$500,000 on private lawyers last year, the Council plans to hire
three lawyers for $226,000 to handle the caseload.
</P>
<P>
   At Giuliani's command is a widely respected army of 685 lawyers,
rivaling in size the nation's largest private law firms. While he
has pared many other agencies, the Law Department has expanded. Its
staff has grown 17 percent since he took office in 1994, according
to the Independent Budget Office, and is budgeted for $85 million
in 1999, a 41 percent rise over its $60 million allotment in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani not only files lawsuits, but critics say he also
provokes suits against his administration by refusing to reach
compromises or by withholding information that previous mayors made
available as a matter of course.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, under Giuliani, advocacy groups have had to sue
for parade permits. The Citizens Budget Commission, a 66-year-old
watchdog group, has sued for records it used to get freely. So have
members of the news media. New York Press Club president Gabe
Pressman, who in 50 years has covered eight mayors, said, ``I've
never seen anything like this.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   State and federal courts have repeatedly overruled the mayor in
his feuds with other officials, First Amendment cases and disputes
over public records. Eve Burton, a lawyer for The Daily News who
tracks the records cases, said, ``The mayor has lost all of them.''
The New York Civil Liberties Union says it has tangled with the
mayor in court in 17 cases, and won all but two, not counting the
car-seizure decision, which it is appealing.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor even tried unsuccessfully to ban New York magazine's
bus ads touting itself as ``the only good thing in New York Rudy
hasn't taken credit for.'' David Dinkins, whom Giuliani defeated
for mayor, said: ``City money was used to bring that lawsuit. It
was just dead wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   When the mayor fails to get his way, he often voices contempt
for the courts. Ordered to permit a march against police brutality,
he scoffed at ``the imperial federal court'' and said judges
``think they're put here by God.'' He has scorned rulings as
``idiotic,'' ``not honest'' and ``the product of the Democratic
machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Some accuse Giuliani of trying to intimidate the judiciary. In
1997, City Bar Association president Michael Cardozo warned against
attempts ``to bully the courts.'' Ed Koch, who as mayor created a
merit selection panel for judges, broke with Giuliani when he
ignored it. Giuliani uses his reappointment powers to punish judges
he does not like, Koch said, calling it ``outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   But Crotty, the mayor's former counsel, said, ``I don't think
judges are or should be exempt from criticism.'' The current
counsel, Michael Hess, said, ``The mayor gets upset when judges
attempt to assume powers of the executive.''
</P>
<P>
   Being litigious bears a price tag. No one keeps a tab on
Giuliani's cases, but experts estimate the cost at millions of
dollars _ including footing the bills of some lawyers who beat the
city. Lawyers for the street artists, for example, collected
$448,000 after a judge upheld the artists' right to sell their work
on the sidewalks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy for the mayor to sue _ it doesn't cost him a
penny,'' said Gene Russianoff, a lawyer for the New York Public
Interest Research Group, a watchdog group. Councilman Walter
McCaffrey, a Queens Democrat, said the mayor uses city lawyers like
``his own Legal Aid Society.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani has altered the corporation counsel's traditional
semiautonomy, critics say. In the past, the counsel advised top
city officials and helped settle disputes. Now, critics say,
Giuliani acts as his own counsel and uses that office against other
officials. Both Hess and Crotty say the role of the corporation
counsel has not changed.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani often says, ``I was a practicing lawyer for a lot
longer than I was Mayor.'' In deciding the car-seizure policy, he
said, ``I spent two hours reading law books and statutes myself _
my real profession is being a lawyer.''
</P>
<P>
   The counsel under Dinkins, Victor Kovner, said of Giuliani:
``Unlike his predecessors, this is a man who still thinks he is a
practicing lawyer. But it's the courts who decide what the law is,
not the mayor.''
</P>
<P>
   The critics say that Giuliani often forces litigation even when
he has little chance of winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``They use the courts with enormous frequency, not so much to
test legal issues, but as a weapon,'' said Eric Lane, the director
of the 1989 City Charter commission and a law professor at Hofstra.
</P>
<P>
   Public Advocate Mark Green, who had to sue to get police
brutality records, said: ``The City's poor win-loss record results
from a client who insists on bringing losing cases because he wants
to exhaust, stall or intimidate critics. Even when he loses
legally, he may have so delayed the march or investigation that he
wins tactically.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, the mayor evicted state Comptroller H. Carl
McCall's auditors from city agencies in 1997. McCall sued. While
Giuliani lost every round, he kept the auditors at bay by invoking
status quo rights while appealing. McCall's spokeswoman, Joan
Lebow, said, ``By the mayor's tying this up in court for two years,
the comptroller was unable to do the job he is legally mandated to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Coalition to Stop Police Brutality organized 55
protests around the nation for Oct. 22, obstacles arose in two
places: a small California town with a hostile sheriff and New York
City. Although the group asked for a permit six weeks in advance,
the city delayed to the end, forcing a suit. The group won, but the
city filed an appeal that was settled just hours before the march.
</P>
<P>
   ``They strung us out to the last minute,'' said one leader, Carl
Dix. That tactic diverted organizers and reduced the turnout, he
said. U.S. District Court Judge John Martin ruled that the
``unconscionable'' delay ``seriously prejudiced the plaintiffs in
their ability to organize their demonstration.''
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has bragged about such ploys. Taxi drivers charged in
a suit that he illegally blocked their motorcade protest last year.
At the time he said: ``They know that we broke their strike _
destroyed it really. Nobody showed up today. That happened because
we had a plan to stop them from doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   But playing favorites has caused Giuliani to lose cases. An
attempt to bar an AIDS protest in front of City Hall was overturned
because he had welcomed other groups, like the Young Republicans
and Yankee fans.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, groups that oppose the mayor's policies have been
forced to seek relief in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The courts have really become the refuge of last resort,''
said Dr. Ester Fuchs, a Columbia University professor and a
frequent critic of the mayor. ``But it's very costly to sue. That's
part of the tactic. You control the debate by wearing down the
opposition. He's really using dirty tactics. You overwhelm with
power, not the rightness of your position.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics see an inherent paradox between Giuliani's tactics and
the image he projects. ``The irony is this is a mayor who talks a
lot about the rule of law _ but the law also applies to the
mayor,'' said Richard Briffault, a law professor at Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Charles King, the director of Housing Works, an AIDS group that
won cases for a street march and City Hall protest, said, ``There's
a sense that he's above the law, and he's not going to follow it
unless you get a court order.''

IN WAITING, TO TAME THE NORTH ATLANTIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARBARA LLOYD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Teams on race boats with a craving for adventure are
tied up at yacht harbors around New York, all eager for a chance at
toppling the trans-Atlantic speed record. Each covets a brisk
breeze, a windy low-pressure system that will carry its sailboat
into a record-breaking passage across a notoriously tricky North
Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   At Liberty Landing, a marina in Jersey City, N.J., the 60-foot
trimaran Foncia Immobilier, has waited for a favorable weather
window for two weeks. At North Cove Yacht Harbor in Lower
Manhattan, the 92-foot monohull, Stealth, has been in and out of
the basin since April 12 on its watch. And within the next month,
Explorer, the 86-foot catamaran that in 1993 sailed around the
world in a record 79 days, is expected to tie up for the Atlantic
wait at Chelsea Piers in Manhattan. Giovanni Soldini, however, the
recent victor in the Around Alone, has decided to forgo his record
attempt this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's historically what put sailboat racing on the map,'' said
Cam Lewis, a 42-year-old ocean racer from Lincolnville, Maine,
referring to the trans-Atlantic voyage. ``Giant sailboats with some
of the wealthiest people in America set the whole thing up when
they tried to beat each other across the Atlantic in their yachts.
The trip from New York to England is the classic speed distance
record. In everybody's heart, it is the Holy Grail of long-distance
passages.''
</P>
<P>
   The players, of course, have changed over the years. No longer
do grand prix races such as the America's Cup require that
participants sail their race boats trans-Atlantic to reach the
event, as they did in the late 19th century. Now corporate
sponsorship is involved, and so too is a fascination for
long-distance racing by French sailors.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was the only American in a French crew aboard Explorer
when it set its global record six years ago. Bruno Peyron of
France, its skipper then and now, has made sailboat records his
life's pursuit. Two years ago, the Peyron team set a five-day
trans-Pacific record. And last August, he and his crew set a 14-day
pace from Yokohama, Japan, to San Francisco, a 4,500-mile trip.
</P>
<P>
   But still eluding Peyron is the six-day trans-Atlantic multihull
passage set in 1990 by Serge Madec, another Frenchman, aboard his
75-foot catamaran, Jet Services V. The time is faster by three days
than the current monohull record of nine days set by Mari-Chah III
last October.
</P>
<P>
   As sailboat records go, Jet Services' pace has been uncommonly
enduring. But it would seem that Peyron could easily beat it since
his yacht Explorer is the old Jet Services. Modified by Peyron for
his 1993 circumnavigation, the catamaran is 11 feet longer than it
was in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Peyron, however, is about to face a formidable rival for the
Atlantic title in Steve Fossett, a securities executive from
Chicago. Fossett, whose effort to set a round-the-world passage in
a balloon was ended on March 19 when a Swiss team completed the
trip first, has increasingly focused on sailing among his other
record pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   Fossett's boat, which he has named Play Station, is a 105-foot
catamaran, which established a 24-hour record for sailboats with a
580-nautical-mile day in March off the coast of New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week in Newport, R.I., Fossett said he also
has his eyes on the trans-Atlantic record. A recent fire on board,
however, which started in the catamaran's battery bank, has delayed
the Play Station project by three or four months. A 26-foot section
of the boat's starboard hull was ruined.
</P>

REAL ESTATE: LONGTIME LANDLORD PONDERS BECOMING A DEVELOPER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN HOLUSHA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the subsidiary of an institution that is 302 years
old, Trinity Real Estate tends to take the long view of things. For
the last decade and a half it has been transforming most of the 5.5
million square feet of industrial buildings it acquired _
unwillingly _ during the 1930s into office space.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is about to take the next step: development. Executives
of the unit of the Parish of Trinity Church have selected four
properties that can be demolished or totally remodeled into 2
million square feet of new offices.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone is getting carried away. These projects are not
likely to be built on speculation. Tenants, in most cases, will
have to sign leases for a substantial share of each building before
a spade goes into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not risk takers,'' said Joseph Palombi, executive vice
president of real estate for Trinity Church. ``The only way we are
going ahead with these projects is if we have tenants for 60
percent or more of the space.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he said, the time is ripe for development by a
company that owns its building sites, does not need zoning changes
and is in an area that has proved attractive to the computer- and
Internet-related companies that have been multiplying in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
   Handling architects' renderings of new buildings is an unusual
sensation for managers of a portfolio of former lofts and factories
clustered near the Holland Tunnel that until the early 1990s mostly
housed printing companies. The buildings are a lingering legacy of
a gift of 215 acres of land by England's Queen Anne in 1705 that is
now generally thought of as the west side of lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the royally deeded land was sold or given away over the
intervening centuries to found churches, hospitals and an
educational institution now known as Columbia University. As New
York industrialized in the early part of the 1900s, the church
allowed developers to build sturdy factory buildings, most of them
occupied by printing companies eager to be close to their
financial-industry clients on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Trinity retained ownership of the land and simply collected the
ground rent until the Depression of the 1930s. The collapse of the
economy left tenants unable to make mortgage and tax payments and
the church was forced to take title to the properties to avoid
losing them to lenders or the city. The debt it assumed was not
retired until the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1980s, Trinity's real estate managers decided they
did not want to be in a printing business that was clearly in
long-term decline with the advent of electronic communications.
They began remodeling the industrial buildings to attract office
tenants, particularly the new-media and other computer-related
companies that were springing up in the city.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like these were not interested in the supposed
prestige and high cost of midtown Manhattan. They installed
open-space layouts and strung the multitude of wires needed for
connections in overhead racks and got to work.
</P>
<P>
   That conversion process is still under way.
</P>
<P>
   Trinity is renovating a triangular, 1.1-million-square-foot
building bounded by Canal, Varick and Watts streets for office use
by enlarging the lobby, replacing elevators, bringing in additional
electrical power and telecommunications and installing new windows
to shut out the din of traffic at the Holland Tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   Once known as 75 Varick St., the building has been renamed 1
Hudson Square as part of an effort to put a brand name on the
Trinity portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed development projects include one large building
that would occupy the entire block bounded by Hudson, Varick,
Spring and Vandam streets and three more modest undertakings.
</P>
<P>
   Palombi said the low vacancy rates and the dearth of new
construction in the city has convinced Trinity's leaders that there
will be tenants eager to occupy brand-new space. And because the
church owns the land, it can charge lower rents than are possible
in situations where a third-party landowner is part of the
equation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figure that we have a $15 to $20 a square foot advantage
over comparable space in midtown,'' he said, referring to projected
annual rents. ``That adds up to a big number over a period of
years.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that a 1.2-million-square-foot building could be erected
on the site, which is currently occupied with smaller,
Trinity-owned structures, without the need for a change in zoning.
Because the building, to be designated 4 Hudson Square, would cost
from $260 million to $300 million to build, the church will not
proceed without a lease, and possibly financial participation, from
a tenant whose solid credit will enable economical borrowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fantasy is that a company like AT&AMP;T or IBM will take the
entire building,'' said Stephen Heyman, the director of commercial
leasing for Trinity.
</P>
<P>
   Palombi said that while Trinity will be the owner of the
building, the church will hire a developer to supervise the
detailed planning and construction.
</P>
<P>
   One of the buildings on the site, 304 Hudson St., which is 85
percent occupied, largely by information-technology tenants, may be
incorporated in the larger structure, but smaller buildings facing
Varick Street are likely to be demolished, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If a suitable tenant can be found soon, the building could be
ready for occupancy by early 2003.
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 800,000 square feet of potential development is
divided among three projects. One is at 330 Hudson _ to be
designated 6 Hudson Square _ which occupies the western half of the
block bounded by Hudson, Varick, Vandam and Charlton streets. The
building is occupied by a document-storage company, but Trinity
officials said there is an opportunity to terminate the lease in
about a year.
</P>
<P>
   The plan here would be to strip the building down to its steel
frame, use an alley in back to install a modern core and add four
floors to the top, expanding it to 425,000 square feet. Once again,
Trinity officials say they can make the alterations within existing
zoning, a situation that is called ``as of right'' in the industry.

</P>
<P>
   Because no foundation work will be involved, Trinity officials
say they will be able to deliver what will amount to a new building
quicker and cheaper, possibly by the end of 2002. ``We may do this
one without a tenant,'' said Palombi, who noted that the building
would offer new space at a rental rate in the mid-30s per square
foot annually compared with $45 a square foot and above for older
space in midtown.
</P>
<P>
   A small parking lot and garage to the east of the building at
345 Hudson St., now known as 555 Greenwich St., would be replaced
with a slender building that has been designated 7 Hudson Square.
The building could rise as much as 15 stories with 220,000 square
feet of space. The building is being designed so that its floors
match up with the Trinity-owned 345 Hudson, so that tenants in the
Hudson Street building could expand via connections with the new
structure.
</P>
<P>
   An unused automobile service station adjacent to a Trinity
property at 100 Ave. of the Americas would be converted into a
six-story office building with 23,000 square feet of office space
that could be connected to the larger structure.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the new building, Trinity officials said there is
an opportunity to add 50,000 square feet of penthouse space to the
building at 350 Hudson St.
</P>
<P>
   Trinity officials say the benefits of the new buildings will be
greater than the rents they can collect on the added space. New
Class A buildings, they say, will enhance the entire portfolio by
enhancing the image of the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our interest in developing these buildings goes beyond any
individual project,'' Heyman said. ``These developments will raise
the value of the other space in the area.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the area began its transformation from light
manufacturing to office when the Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi advertising
agency moved into a new building at 375 Hudson St. in the
mid-1980s. Although Trinity does not own the building, which was
built by Tishman Speyer Properties, the company that controls
Rockefeller Center, the church benefits from more than the changed
image the building brought to the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``We,'' Palombi said, ``own the land.''

IN HARTFORD, A NEW BATTLEGROUND FOR ABORTION DEBATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ For most of the decade, supporters of abortion
rights at the Connecticut Capitol wanted little more than to bask
in the state's reputation for friendliness toward their agenda.
They had insurance _ in 1990, the Legislature had enacted the
provisions of Roe vs. Wade into state law, in case the Supreme
Court ever reversed that decision _ and a vote on any other
abortion measure was seen by women's groups as asking for trouble.
</P>
<P>
   So for the last nine years, as political careers elsewhere were
staked on such fights as whether parents should consent to a
teen-ager's planned abortion or merely be notified about it,
legislative leaders in Hartford did not even permit a debate on an
abortion bill.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years however, both sides had come up with
something they dearly wanted. Women's groups began pushing what
they called ``the pill bill,'' which would require health insurers
to pay for prescription birth control. And anti-abortion groups
were seeking, state by state, to outlaw the late-term procedure
they call partial-birth abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion opponents promised that any time the pill bill came up,
they would try to add a partial-birth amendment, effectively
sabotaging the contraceptive measure. This was just the sort of
fight women's groups wanted to avoid, since they believed it could
usher in other anti-abortion inroads, like restrictions for minors,
or rights for fetuses in criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   But a new speaker of the House, Moira Lyons, D-Stamford, took
office in January, and she brokered a deal that may seem obvious
but was the product of more than a year of shuttle negotiations
between the abortion camps. She gave each side a clean shot _ a
separate vote and debate on its bill, with no amendments allowed.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side was confident about the outcome. Democrats control
both chambers of the state Legislature, but, flouting the platforms
of their national parties, a big bloc of Democrats opposes abortion
and quite a few Republicans favor abortion rights. Lobbying groups
for both sides engineered a flood of calls and faxes to
legislators. The Connecticut Catholic Conference even included
legislators' phone numbers in alerts to parishes.
</P>
<P>
   When the votes were over last week, abortion opponents, who had
finally got their chance, were further behind than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The pill bill sailed through both the House and Senate, and the
late-term abortion measure was overwhelmingly defeated by both
chambers. Reflecting the issue's complex calculus, Speaker Lyons,
who refuses to classify herself as ``pro-choice'' or ``pro-life,''
voted for the contraceptive measure but also for the late-term
abortion ban.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. John Rowland, a moderate Republican who once opposed
abortion but now seems comfortable with his stance in favor of
abortion rights, has said he will sign the contraceptive measure,
which has passed several other legislatures but is in effect only
in Maryland. The Connecticut measure includes a ``conscience
clause'' that exempts church-affiliated employers, like Catholic
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators in Hartford said the debates were the most memorable
in years. Many legislators conspicuously sorted papers or stared at
their laptop computers while abortion opponents in the House read
gruesome descriptions of the late-term procedure, which doctors
call ``intact dilation and extraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Adela Eads, R-Kent, argued that abortion was a private
matter. ``This is the end of the 1990s _ get with it,'' said Sen.
Eads, 79, who is the minority leader. Noting that women feel birth,
she said, ``What do you fellas feel? It's just another mouth to
feed.''
</P>
<P>
   Several leading legislators argued that the late-term procedure
defeats _ 86-57 in the House, and 26-10 in the Senate _ were
decisive enough that abortion questions are unlikely to be taken up
again for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There would have to be a demonstration that you would not be
wasting the chamber's time,'' said Rep. Claudia ``Dolly'' Powers, a
Republican from Greenwich who helped engineer the victory for
women's groups.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Blei, the lobbyist for the Connecticut chapters of
Planned Parenthood and the National Abortion Rights Action League,
is not so sure. ``Defeat will mean the opposition will work hard to
organize,'' she said. She seems to be on to something.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, abortion opponents gathered in Baltic, 50 miles
southeast of the Capitol, and, surrounded by booths featuring
colorful plastic fetuses at various stages of development, promised
to keep fighting, even as they anticipated defeat. ``We're not just
going to say, `Gosh darn!' and go home,'' said Lynne Poulos, the
treasurer of the Connecticut Christian Coalition. ``It's tough in
icy, cold Connecticut. But we know the Bible, so we know how it
comes out.''
</P>
<P>
   And Connecticut Right to Life president William C. O'Brien said
the defeats have a strategic byproduct: a clear voting record for
use in future campaigns.

EDITORIAL: IRAN'S DIPLOMATIC INITIATIVES 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, May 23:
</P>
<P>
   Iranian President Mohammad Khatami's trip to three Arab
countries last week was a revealing effort to ease Tehran's
isolation from most of its Mideast neighbors. Khatami's tour got
off to a disturbing start in Syria, the one major Arab country with
which Tehran has maintained close relations since Iran's 1979
revolution. Among other things, Syria allows Iran to arm and train
anti-Israeli Hezbollah guerrillas in Lebanon. Regrettably, Khatami
met in Damascus not only with Hezbollah's leadership, but also with
representatives of radical Palestinian groups that reject the peace
agreements between Israel and the mainstream Palestinian leadership
under Yasser Arafat. Iran's position is that it would accept any
peace treaty with Israel agreed to by Arafat _ or by Syrian
President Hafez Assad.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant destination was Saudi Arabia, where Khatami
spent four days. He was the first Iranian president since 1979 to
visit this important Persian Gulf neighbor. Iran and Saudi Arabia
have clashed repeatedly over Tehran's support for Shiite
revolutionaries and the management of Iranian pilgrimages to Mecca.
Iran has also denounced Saudi military ties with the United States.
But last week, the stress was on common interests, including
cooperation to raise low oil prices. Khatami avoided criticism of
Riyadh's relations with Washington. The final stop was Qatar, which
has warm relations with the United States and moderate positions on
Israel but has still managed to remain friendly with Iran.
</P>
<P>
   If Khatami can keep his clerical foes in check, cut Tehran's
remaining ties with terrorism and halt Iranian nuclear weapons
development, normal relations with America will also be possible. &QL;

HOME RUN BARRAGE CONTRIBUTES TO THE RISE IN SCORING 
THEORIES FOR THE HOMER SURGE 
DIAMONDBACKS RETURN INVESTMENT 
TATIS CREDITS HIS COACH
</HEADLINE>
   (rk)

<P>
   Before last season, no one had ever hit 70 home runs in a
season, but before this season no one had ever hit two grand slams
in the same inning and no one had hit a grand slam in each game of
a doubleheader. It's offensive mayhem, Part II.
</P>
<P>
   ``You check the scoreboard during games and see all these
lopsided games,'' Mike Hargrove, the Cleveland Indians' manager,
said. ``I haven't looked at any cumulative numbers, but it
certainly seems to me that there are a lot more runs being
scored.''
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove's hunch is correct. Teams are scoring runs this season
at a rate nearly 8 percent ahead of last year at the equivalent
time; they are hitting home runs at a clip 15 percent above last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the team he watches every day has produced a major
share of the increase. Not only do the Indians have a controversial
nickname, but they also have a mightily offensive group of guys.
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove's hackers have scored two runs a game more than they
did last year, and they have hit nearly 50 percent more home runs.
They are also at the forefront of a general increase in
double-digit scoring and grand slam slugging.
</P>
<P>
   Last year at this time hitters had crushed 38 pitches for grand
slams; this year they have socked 46. Last year Sandy Alomar Jr.
hit the lone grand slam to this point for the Indians. His brother,
Roberto, hit the team's first this season, and David Justice, Manny
Ramirez and Richie Sexson added three in a five-game span last
week.
</P>
<P>
   But the four most notable grand slam feats this season belong to
Fernando Tatis of St. Louis, Robin Ventura of the Mets, Nomar
Garciaparra of Boston and Ken Griffey Jr. of Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   In any other season, the pair of grand slams that Griffey hit in
successive games on consecutive days and the pair that Garciaparra
hit in one game would have grabbed all of the attention.
</P>
<P>
   But on April 23, Tatis became the first player to hit two grand
slams in one inning, and last Thursday Ventura, who in 1995 slugged
two grand slams in consecutive innings, became the first to hit one
in each game of a doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
   Ventura's explosive production powered the Mets to double
figures in each game, giving them five such games compared with two
at this time last year. They are one of the teams responsible for
an increase in double-digit scoring this season. The American
League is up slightly to 65 double-figure scores from 63, and the
National League is up to 57 from 47.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona Diamondbacks have made the most eye-opening advance,
scoring 10 runs or more eight times this season compared with one
in a similar period last year. The Indians have raised their
double-digit output, to 10 games from 6.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate double-digit game was played last Wednesday in
Denver, where Cincinnati outslugged Colorado, 24-12. The score
prompted Jack McKeon, the Reds' manager, to remark about Jim
Leyland, the Rockies' manager, ``He ought to go across town and get
a kicker.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Hammonds epitomized the bizarre nature of the game. He
entered with a .132 batting average (5 for 38) and no home runs,
then became the fifth player this year to hit three home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the pitchers had any zip,'' McKeon said. ``Whether it
was the air, the atmosphere or what, I don't know. It was like
watching batting practice, the way balls were flying out of there
and going against the walls, going 30, 40 feet farther than they
normally do. I just threw that game out the window and said forget
it; you probably won't see another one too quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   But less than two weeks earlier, the Indians scored 18 runs in
their final three turns at bat and beat Tampa Bay, 20-11. The way
runs are cascading across the plate more such games will follow.

   WASHINGTON _ We are in Kosovo with our allies to stand for a
Europe, within our reach for the first time, that is peaceful,
undivided and free. And we are there to stand against the greatest
remaining threat to that vision: instability in the Balkans, fueled
by a vicious campaign of ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not simply ethnic hatred, or even ethnic
conflict. The people of the former Yugoslavia have lived together
for centuries with greater and lesser degrees of conflict, but not
the constant ``cleansing'' of peoples from their land. Had they
experienced nothing but that, their nations would be homogenous
today, not endlessly diverse.
</P>
<P>
   The intolerable conditions the region finds itself in today are
the result of a decadelong campaign by Slobodan Milosevic to build
a greater Serbia by singling out whole peoples for destruction
because of their ethnicity and faith. The brutal methods are
familiar now. Spreading hate in the media. Killing moderate
leaders. Arming paramilitaries and ordering soldiers to conduct
planned campaigns of murder and expulsion. Eradicating the culture,
the heritage, the very record of the presence of his victims.
Refugees are not a byproduct of the fighting he has initiated; the
fighting is designed to create refugees. We are haunted by the
images of people driven from their homes, pushing the elderly in
wheelbarrows, telling stories of relatives murdered.
</P>
<P>
   We saw this for the first time in Croatia and in Bosnia. The
international community responded at first with a studied
neutrality that equated victims with aggressors; it followed with
diplomacy and the deployment of unarmed peacekeepers with the
mandate, but not the means, to protect civilians. By the time NATO
acted, 250,000 people were dead, more than two million displaced,
and many have still not returned. People will look back on Kosovo
and say that this time, because we acted soon and forcefully
enough, more lives were saved and the refugees all came home. The
Balkan conflict that began 10 years ago in Kosovo will have ended
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   We cannot respond to such tragedies everywhere, but when ethnic
conflict turns into ethnic cleansing where we can make a
difference, we must try, and that is clearly the case in Kosovo.
Had we faltered, the result would have been a moral and strategic
disaster. The Kosovars would have become a people without a
homeland, living in difficult conditions in some of the poorest
countries in Europe, overwhelming new democracies. The Balkan
conflict would have continued indefinitely, posing a risk of a
wider war and of continuing tensions with Russia. NATO itself would
have been discredited for failing to defend the very values that
give it meaning. Those who say Kosovo is too small to be of great
importance forget these simple facts.
</P>
<P>
   When the violence in Kosovo began in early 1998, we exhausted
every diplomatic avenue for a settlement. Last October, we
convinced Milosevic that he should withdraw some forces from Kosovo
and allow an unarmed international presence. That is the solution
advocates of compromise propose today. But it failed last fall.
Milosevic broke his promises, poured more troops into Kosovo,
poised for an offensive he had been planning for months. When it
began, we had to act.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's strategy has been to outlast us by dividing the
alliance. He has failed. Instead of disunity in Brussels, there are
growing signs of disaffection in Belgrade: Serbian soldiers
abandoning their posts, Serbian civilians protesting the policies
of their leader, young men avoiding conscription, prominent Serbs
calling on Milosevic to accept NATO's conditions. Meanwhile, our
air campaign has destroyed or damaged one-third of Serbia's armored
vehicles in Kosovo, half its artillery, most of its ability to
produce ammunition, all its capacity to refine fuel and done
enormous damage to other sectors of its economy. Though he has
driven hundreds of thousands of Kosovar Albanians from their homes,
Milosevic has not eliminated the Kosovar Liberation Army. Indeed,
its ranks are swelling, and it has begun to go on the offensive
against Serb forces hunkered down to hide from air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Now Milosevic faces the certainty of continuing air strikes, the
persistence of the KLA and the prospect of having to answer to his
people for starting an unwinnable conflict that is bringing
military failure and economic ruin. The question now is not whether
his ethnic cleansing will be reversed, but when, and how much of
his military he is willing to see destroyed along the way.
</P>
<P>
   While I do not rule out other military options, we are pursuing
our present strategy for three reasons. First, and most important,
it is working and will succeed in meeting NATO's basic conditions
of restoring the Kosovars to their homes, with Serb forces out of
Kosovo and the deployment of an international security force. This
force must have NATO at its core, which means it must have NATO
command and control and NATO rules of engagement, with special
arrangements for non-NATO countries, just like our force in Bosnia.
Our military campaign will continue until these conditions are met,
not because we are stubborn or arbitrary, but because these are the
only conditions under which the refugees will go home in safety and
under which the KLA have any incentive to disarm _ the basic
requirements of a resolution that will work.
</P>
<P>
   Second, this strategy has broad and deep support in the
alliance, and allows us to meet our objectives. While there may be
differences in domestic circumstances, cultural ties to the Balkans
and ideas on tactics, there is no question about our unity on goals
and our will to prevail. I have worked hard to shape our present
consensus; 60 days into the air campaign, NATO is more unified on
Kosovo than it was at the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Third, this strategy gives us the best opportunity to meet our
goals in a way that strengthens, not weakens, our fundamental
interest in a long-term, positive relationship with Russia. Russia
is now helping to work out a way for Belgrade to meet our
conditions. Russian troops should participate in the force that
will keep the peace in Kosovo, turning a source of tension into an
opportunity for cooperation, like our joint effort in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, we must remember that the reversal of ethnic cleansing
in Kosovo is not sufficient to end ethnic conflict in the Balkans
and establish lasting stability. The European Union and the United
States must do for southeastern Europe what we did for Western
Europe after World War II and for Central Europe after the Cold
War. Freedom, respect for minority rights, and prosperity are
powerful forces for progress. They give people goals to work for;
they elevate hope over fear and tomorrow over yesterday. We can do
that by rebuilding struggling economies, encouraging trade and
investment and helping the nations of the region join NATO and the
European Union. Already, the region's democracies are responding to
the pull of integration by sticking with their reforms, taking in
refugees and supporting NATO's campaign. A democratic Serbia that
respects the rights of its people and its neighbors can and should
join them. If it does, we will help to restore it to its rightful
place as a European state in the Balkans, not a balkanized state at
the periphery of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The Balkans are not fated to be the heart of European darkness,
a region of bombed mosques, men and boys shot in the back, young
women raped, all traces of group and individual history rewritten
or erased. Just as leaders took their people down that road,
leaders must take them back to a better tomorrow. Ultimately, we
and our allies can help make this happen, if we stick with NATO's
campaign and follow through with a strategy to ensure that the
forces pulling southeastern Europe together are stronger than the
forces tearing it apart.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ We are in Kosovo with our allies to stand for a
Europe, within our reach for the first time, that is peaceful,
undivided and free. And we are there to stand against the greatest
remaining threat to that vision: instability in the Balkans, fueled
by a vicious campaign of ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not simply ethnic hatred, or even ethnic
conflict. The people of the former Yugoslavia have lived together
for centuries with greater and lesser degrees of conflict, but not
the constant ``cleansing'' of peoples from their land. Had they
experienced nothing but that, their nations would be homogenous
today, not endlessly diverse.
</P>
<P>
   The intolerable conditions the region finds itself in today are
the result of a decadelong campaign by Slobodan Milosevic to build
a greater Serbia by singling out whole peoples for destruction
because of their ethnicity and faith. The brutal methods are
familiar now. Spreading hate in the media. Killing moderate
leaders. Arming paramilitaries and ordering soldiers to conduct
planned campaigns of murder and expulsion. Eradicating the culture,
the heritage, the very record of the presence of his victims.
Refugees are not a byproduct of the fighting he has initiated; the
fighting is designed to create refugees. We are haunted by the
images of people driven from their homes, pushing the elderly in
wheelbarrows, telling stories of relatives murdered.
</P>
<P>
   We saw this for the first time in Croatia and in Bosnia. The
international community responded at first with a studied
neutrality that equated victims with aggressors; it followed with
diplomacy and the deployment of unarmed peacekeepers with the
mandate, but not the means, to protect civilians. By the time NATO
acted, 250,000 people were dead, more than two million displaced,
and many have still not returned. People will look back on Kosovo
and say that this time, because we acted soon and forcefully
enough, more lives were saved and the refugees all came home. The
Balkan conflict that began 10 years ago in Kosovo will have ended
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   We cannot respond to such tragedies everywhere, but when ethnic
conflict turns into ethnic cleansing where we can make a
difference, we must try, and that is clearly the case in Kosovo.
Had we faltered, the result would have been a moral and strategic
disaster. The Kosovars would have become a people without a
homeland, living in difficult conditions in some of the poorest
countries in Europe, overwhelming new democracies. The Balkan
conflict would have continued indefinitely, posing a risk of a
wider war and of continuing tensions with Russia. NATO itself would
have been discredited for failing to defend the very values that
give it meaning. Those who say Kosovo is too small to be of great
importance forget these simple facts.

   Theories for the Homer Surge
</P>
<P>
   As in every other year when runs and home runs have increased,
the question is asked. Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a year and a half beyond expansion, and the pitching
right now is absolutely horrible,'' Don Baylor, the Atlanta hitting
coach, said.
</P>
<P>
   Jack McKeon goes for the ball theory. ``The ball is livelier;
it's smaller,'' the Cincinnati manager said. ``Everybody denies it,
but I don't think all of a sudden the guys have become this
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Curt Schilling offered yet a third reason: the umpires and the
new strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've stopped calling the pitch off plate,'' the
Philadelphia pitcher said, ``but to make sure they're not accused
of it, they've stopped calling corners. You have to throw the ball
not over the plate but over the white middle of the plate more than
I've ever had to.''
</P>
<P>
   Umpires, Schilling added, have also stopped calling low strikes
because they are calling high strikes. ``The strike zone is
incredibly different this year,'' he said. ``It's smaller; it's
different. It's drastically different.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the strike zone has been altered this season by fiat of
the commissioner's office, it presents the most intriguing
possibility. Sandy Alderson, the man in the commissioner's office
who is most directly involved in strike zone developments, didn't
reject the possibility of a link between umpires' ball-strike calls
and run production.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strike zone may have something to do with it,'' said
Alderson, the executive vice president for baseball operations.
``That hasn't been mentioned to me directly, but we're monitoring
both the strike zone and the run production. It is conceivable the
zone has gotten smaller. What we're seeing through the charting
we're doing is the pitch off the plate is no longer being called a
strike, but there is some inconsistency at the top end of the
strike zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Umpires were told before the season to stop calling strikes on
pitches off the corners of the plate. In recent years, the strike
zone had spread horizontally. At the same time, umpires were told
to call strikes on pitches two inches above the belt. For years,
pitches above the waist had been called balls.
</P>
<P>
   With clubs instructed to chart pitches of each game, officials
are following the degree to which umpires have adhered to the
instructions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Umpires almost uniformly are correct on those in and out
pitches,'' Alderson said. ``Very few pitches are being `missed' in
and out. And down by the way. There has been a little inconsistency
at the top of the strike zone based on what we're seeing.''
</P>
<P>
   Alderson said he had not studied the run production, but he
figured to be unhappy with what he sees when he looks at the
numbers. Through Friday, 6,318 runs had been scored in 609 games
compared with 5,871 runs scored in the first 612 games last season.
Home runs were up, 1,413 to 1,225.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only speaking for myself in this instance, I am not happy with
the amount of run production that exists in the game right now,''
Alderson said. ``We're threatening to see a real imbalance.''
</P>
<P>
   Alderson said he believed the growing imbalance had more to do
with the strength of hitters and thinness of pitching than the
strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to keep our eye on the proper balance between pitching
and hitting,'' he said. ``We have to be constantly vigilant of the
balance.''
</P>
<P>
   Because home runs stand out in any scrutiny of the mushrooming
offense, Alderson said, ``In our long-term approach and vision for
the game, we have to think in terms of how important we want the
home run to become.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not say what steps might be taken if it is determined
that pitchers are taking too much of a beating, but one option
would be further adjustment to the strike zone. The zone might be
smaller horizontally, or east-west, but it could grow vertically,
north-south, with a return to the rule-book definition of the upper
limit.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the midpoint between the top of the uniform pants
and the top of the shoulders. That strike hasn't been seen during
the careers of the players in the major leagues today.
</P>
<P>
   A larger strike zone certainly would reduce the number of walks,
meaning fewer runners on base for the big run producers to drive
in. Like runs and home runs, walks are up this season, nearly 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks Return Investment
</P>
<P>
   When the two-year-old Arizona Diamondbacks took over first place
in the N.L. West last week _ for a day, it turned out _ Jerry
Colangelo did not rush to the telephone to ask his fellow owners
what they thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not polling to see what anyone's opinion is,'' said
Colangelo, the managing partner, whose off-season expenditures on
free agents were criticized by other owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still maintain we all need to do what we feel is appropriate
and what is in the best interests of our franchise. I stand by our
investments in players to protect the investment we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Colangelo said the owners have more than $350 million invested
in the team, adding, ``When you have that kind of an investment, my
attitude was we need to win and be competitive in order to make
sure we maintain a great deal of interest.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he added: ``There are some teams with substantially higher
payrolls that aren't doing nearly as well. I would be very
concerned if we were near the bottom with our payroll.''
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks spent most of their money to improve their
starting pitching, but they didn't ignore their offense and it has
been more impressive than the pitching. Arizona leads the league in
runs, home runs, total bases and slugging percentage.
</P>
<P>
   Tatis Credits His Coach
</P>
<P>
   When Mo Vaughn heard that Mike Easler, the St. Louis Cardinals'
new hitting coach, was being credited for the improvement in
Fernando Tatis' hitting, he was not surprised. Vaughn has long
credited Easler for making him the hitter he is today.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to believe in yourself and he makes you believe you
can be successful,'' Anaheim's Vaughn said. ``The best thing about
a hitting instructor is that he can get you to transfer what you
practice in the batting cage to the field. Mike is good at doing
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn said that when he encountered Easler in Boston in 1993:
``I was a natural hitter, but I didn't know how to get the best out
of my ability. He gave me a good solid base that I could always
refer back to as a hitter. Fernando Tatis will always remember Mike
Easler from here on out in his career, the same as I always
will.'' &QL;

GOING DOWNHILL, LOROUPE OUTDISTANCES FIELD 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With about two miles remaining in Saturday's Avon
Mini Marathon in Central Park, Tegla Loroupe, the world-class
Kenyan distance runner, peeked over her shoulder for the first
time. She saw pain on the faces behind her.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing weakness, Loroupe did what all champions do; she pushed
the pace. Down a steep hill, around a tight bend, Loroupe's lead
grew quickly. Five seconds, and then 10 seconds, until she was
alone, headed for the finish line near Tavern on the Green, where
she won the 10-kilometer race for the fourth time in 31 minutes 48
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm so happy to win this race again,'' said Loroupe, who
collected $15,000 for her victory. The $50,000 purse was a record
amount for a women's 6.2-mile race.
</P>
<P>
   Gete Wami of Ethiopia finished second in 32:00 and Lidia Simon
of Romania was third in 32:01. Wami, 24, won the 8-kilometer race
at this year's world cross-country championships and was running
her first road race in the United States on Saturday. Simon, 25, is
especially noted for her sixth-place finish in the marathon at the
1996 Olympic Games in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Loroupe's only challenger in the final mile Saturday was a
stubborn in-line skater who did not clear a path for her. ``I
almost collided with him,'' she said. ``I was scared because that
guy was huge and I'm small. I was lucky not to hit him.''
</P>
<P>
   Loroupe, 26, won here in 1993, 1996 and 1997, and is a two-time
winner of the New York City Marathon (1994 and 1995). She set the
marathon world record of 2:20:47 in Rotterdam in 1998. Known for
her endurance, Loroupe on Saturday proved once again that she has
speed, too. She ran the fifth mile in a blistering 4:47, a pace
that proved too much for the other lead-pack runners.
</P>
<P>
   About Loroupe's decisive downhill surge, Wami said: ``I'm not so
good going downhill. When Tegla made the move, she was too fast for
me. My legs could not keep up.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's times were disappointing, because the race featured
dozens of the world's best female runners. In fact, the field was
considered the most talented in the race's 28-year history. But the
quality of runners could not overcome a conservative start and
draining heat and humidity. So the race record of 31:00, set by the
nine-time New York City Marathon winner Grete Waitz in 1980, will
remain the standard for at least one more year.
</P>
<P>
   The first Americans to cross the finish line Saturday were
Libbie Hickman, 34, of Fort Collins, Colo. (10th, 32:39), and Anne
Marie Lauck of Hampton, N.J. (12th, 33:12). Hickman was named
distance runner of the year by USA Track and Field in each of the
least two years. Lauck, 30, won the Mini Marathon in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the dozens of elite athletes in the field, more
than 6,000 recreational runners competed Saturday. The race was
founded in 1972 to promote women's fitness. &QL;

 &HT;    School shooting suspect ``charming young man,'' lawyer says
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Duane D. Stanford
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONYERS, Ga. _ The attorney for the Rockdale County, Ga., boy
accused in the shootings at Heritage High School about 25 miles
east of dwontown Atlanta described him Saturday as ``a really
charming young man'' who, contrary to what acquaintances have said,
did not own a gun or have easy access to his stepfather's gun
cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't seem to have an evil bone in his body and I am just
clueless as to why he did it; there's no anger,'' Atlanta attorney
Don Samuel said Saturday. The lawyer visited the boy at a youth
detention center in Lawrenceville Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel declined to relate anything the boy said during Friday's
visit, leaving unanswered the biggest question: Why?
</P>
<P>
   Samuel said he waived a detention hearing that had been
scheduled for Monday in Rockdale County Juvenile Court. He said he
expects Rockdale District Attorney Richard Read to file a motion
early next week to have the suspect tried as an adult. A judge's
decision on that could be weeks away.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel said the suspect's stepfather and mother are struggling
to understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are just absolute shocked, just horrified, just thankful
that the kids are all right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The parents deny students' accounts that they gave their son a
handgun as a gift, Samuel said. Acquaintances in Rockdale and in
Kernersville, N.C., where the suspect's family lived for three
years until moving to Georgia in 1997, have recalled how the boy
liked to show off a handgun. The boy's parents told Samuel that the
revolver used Thursday belonged to the stepfather and that the boy
never touched it before Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   As for the rifle used in the Heritage shootings, Samuel said the
boy and his stepfather were avid deer hunters, and that the boy was
licensed and trained to use such a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday morning, students returned to Heritage to reclaim the
bags and books they left behind when the shooting started. Some
just came to see the aftermath of the attack, which left six
students wounded.
</P>
<P>
   As the last students trickled into Heritage just before noon,
doctors discharged 15-year-old Cania Cullins from Rockdale
Hospital, where surgeons removed a bullet from her knee. She and
her mother, Felicia Cullins, went home ``to take a nap,'' Mrs.
Cullins said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Laster, also 15, was the only shooting victim left
hospitalized Saturday. A spokeswoman for Hughes Spalding Medical
Center said Laster was listed in good condition. She still has a
bullet lodged in her abdomen, but doctors plan to release her early
next week.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Barnhardt, 16, and Jason Cheek, 17, were released from
Rockdale Hospital on Friday. Drake Hoy and Ryan Rosa, both 18, were
released from the hospital hours after they were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel said he will contest Read's expected attempt to move the
case to an adult court, but added, ``It seems most juvenile court
judges in these kinds of cases are going to acquiesce to the D.A.'s
demand.''
</P>
<P>
   Before a decision, Samuel said, both sides will hire
psychatrists to evaluate the suspect. Read, who has said he expects
to seek to have the suspect tied as an adult, could not be reached
Saturday.

   KOSOVO-KLA _ KOSARE, Kosovo _ The hard-faced soldiers lining the
perimeter of this guerrilla army base stood at the ready, fingers
on the triggers of their AK-47 assault rifles, prepared to mow down
an attacking Serb force. But the immediate purpose of the Kovoso
Liberation Army troops was to serve as targets for us, a dozen
visiting foreign correspondents and cameramen, the first group of
its kind escorted by the KLA from Albania into the southern
highlands of Kosovo. The KLA wanted us to see their base at Kosare,
and talk to their soldiers, to demonstrate their existence in the
face of claims from Belgrade that the armed resistance movement has
been eliminated, along with the 800,000 refugees who have fled
Kosovo.The evidence was plain to see: The rebels exist.They also
bleed. The sudden artillery duel with Serb forces that left three
KLA soldiers seriously wounded wasn't necessarily what the KLA
wanted us to see. But it was all too genuine. The KLA has
discovered, as has NATO, that conquering Serb forces is not an easy
task. (Holmes, Cox News Service). WITH PHOTOS.

came Saturday. ``We did strike that border command post. It was
until very recently in the hands of the Yugoslav army, but it
appears that it was then subsequently taken over'' by the KLA, said
NATO spokesman Jamie Shea. ``I cannot confirm any number of
casualties.''

   TEENS-BREAKINGUP _ Jay Bakker was enjoying a dinner this week at

teen upset about breaking up with her boyfriend. Bakker, a youth
minister, said he was thrilled he could help her talk through her
pain - which many adults may underestimate. The demise of a love
affair is particularly hard on teenagers, whose raging hormones can
make a breakup a prescription for depression or destruction. Such a
loss seems to have played a role in several recent school
shootings, including Heritage High. In fact, federal teen violence
stats say such rampages are preceded by a breakup more than 50
percent of the time. We talk to specialists and teens about the
intensity of such relationships and how to help kids cope. (Lore,

   COLA-WAR _ MIAMI _ Coca-Cola may be America's most popular soft
drink, yet Orlando housewife America Vaughan(CQ both) is eager to
point out how her new soda, Havana Cola, is different. It has a
citric taste, she says, with the distinctive touch of Key lime. And
although Havana Cola's can is red _ like Coca-Cola's _ its shade is
a candy-apple one. ``It has a different taste, and I think a better
one,'' boasts Vaughan, a 48-year-old mother of four. ``I believe
once people try it they'll pull a switcheroo.'' If sheer exuberance
were an asset, Vaughan _ who's never run a business before _ would
already be a millionaire. But exuberance alone may not be enough.

   UNEXPLORED _ MIAMI _ The explorers battled fat leeches and
cliffsides so steep and slippery, one false step could mean a
plunge of thousands of feet. They navigated a raging, treacherous
river. They even heard rumors of the Dugmas, a cult of females who
attack outsiders with snake venom concealed beneath their
fingernails. It sounds like an Indiana Jones-style adventure, but
it was real. The expedition, sponsored by the National Geographic
Society last November, took four Americans into the inner gorge of
the Tsangpo River, the world's deepest canyon, in a remote part of
Tibet. The 17-day undertaking was a lesson in endurance, but the
reward was extraordinary: the sight of a thundering, 100-foot-high
cascade, dubbed ``Hidden Falls.'' But what's equally extraordinary
is that a giant waterfall on a major river had yet to be recorded.
Indeed, on the eve of the 21st century, there are lots of

MR. ROGERS, MARIST GRADS JOIN IN SONG 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ Fred Rogers, the creator and star of
``Mister Rogers' Neighborhood'' on public television, addressed
1,050 graduates and received an honorary degree at Marist College's
53rd commencement Saturday. Also receiving honorary degrees were
the director of the Peace Corps, Mark Gearan, and Dr. Anne Dyson, a
children's advocate.
</P>
<P>
   Though Rogers, 71, had carefully composed a 15-minute speech,
the sight of an electronic piano on stage inspired a quick change.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a little piano over here,'' he said to the
graduates, who were already clapping with enthusiasm. ``Do you want
to sing?''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers smiled and began: ``It's a beautiful day in the
neighborhood. A beautiful day for a neighbor. Would you be mine?
Could you be mine?''
</P>
<P>
   As more students joined in, Rogers shouted, ``Good! Good for
you!''
</P>
<P>
   There were quiet moments, too. The soft-spoken educator, an
ordained Presbyterian minister, spoke of ethnic cleaning in Kosovo,
the high school massacre in Littleton, Colo., and environmental
destruction as he counseled graduates to make their choices
carefully. And just as he says each day on television, Rogers
assured the graduates that they were special, just by being
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a good feeling to know you're alive,'' he finished,
to applause that went on and on.

VIDEO GAME TOURNAMENT DRAWS TOP `QUAKE II,' `STARCRAFT' PLAYERS  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Ga., Ill.)  (rk) 
 By STEPHEN C. MILLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The tournament had all the trappings of a big league
sporting event: large cash prizes, pre- and post-game interviews
and a broadcast team perched above the action, providing
play-by-play and color commentary.
</P>
<P>
   But it was not sport, at least not in the traditional sense; it
was a championship video game tournament held Friday and Saturday
at an arcade in Times Square called XS New York.
</P>
<P>
   And the broadcast was not on network television, but on the
Internet, with sound bites that had their own distinctive tone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a really tough competitor,'' one player told an
interviewer. ``I thought that I had him after that last spawn, but
he made excellent use of the railgun to frag me a couple of times
before I could get back to my game.''
</P>
<P>
   The tournament, run by the AMD Professional Gamers League,
featured two games, ``Quake II'' and ``Starcraft,'' and the top
prizes included $10,000 in cash. The players, most of them in high
school or college, were between the ages of 16 and 24.
</P>
<P>
   The referees, all about the same age as the competitors, were in
another part of the building, following each game and player with a
bank of computers with sophisticated software monitoring every
aspect of the game. At one point, in a ``Quake II'' Deathmatch, one
player's computer froze. The referees were able to reset both games
to the exact point at which the lockup occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Manfredi, a market researcher from a suburb of Chicago,
cheered like any Little League dad as his 16-year-old son, Eric
``SaboTaj'' Manfredi, played what most considered the best ``Quake
II'' Deathmatch of the tournament. With his son down by one point
and less than a minute to go in the match, Manfredi, who was
upstairs watching on a giant television screen, kept whispering,
``Come on Eric, you can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   With less than 10 seconds left, Eric Manfredi tied the score and
forced the match into overtime. His father yelled, applauded and
grinned from ear to ear. Even though Eric lost in overtime, his
father still seemed proud. One of the other spectators shook his
hand and said, ``What a great game.''
</P>
<P>
   Manfredi was upstairs in the equivalent of a skybox, where VIP's
got to sit down and watch the matches on monitors. Most of the
spectators had to stand in front of the stage downstairs with a
limited view of the players, since the contestants were partially
hidden by a computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second tournament for Kurt Shimada, a 15-year-old
honor student from Pleasanton, Calif. ``This competition is really
cool,'' he said. ``It's great to meet some of the players that I
have been playing online all year.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though there was running commentary on each match, it was
hard to hear because of the explosions, gunfire and squealing tires
of all the arcade's regular games _ ``House of the Dead,'' ``Time
Crisis II,'' ``Battle Tank'' and ``Sega Rally.'' Despite the
tournament, the arcade was still open for business and there were
just as many people engrossed in their own digitally enhanced
escape into shooting bad guys or driving fast cars to pay much
attention.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament began the day after a 15-year-old in Conyers,
Ga., opened fire in his high school, injuring six students, and
most of the contestants were uncomfortable when reporters asked
about the relationship between violent video games and real-life
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Sebastian ``Sybek'' Lenart, 20, a ``Quake II'' finalist from
Ontario, said the games weren't about violence but about
competition. ``You don't think about killing your opponent, but how
to outsmart him. It's a game of skill and intelligence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cathy Chapelsky whose 17-year-old son, Patrick, is known as Kain
the Feared, said that keeping the lines of communication open was
the key to helping children understand the difference between
fantasy and reality. She said the games were beneficial to players.
``It can be a way of getting out frustrations,'' she said.

EDITORIAL NOTEBOOK: SURVIVING THE GOWANUS CANAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ELEANOR RANDOLPH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a sunny afternoon recently, the green stuff
shimmering in Brooklyn's Gowanus Canal looked a lot like water. It
was a fairly viscous form of water, of course, with the occasional
streak of putrescence that has made the Gowanus famous as one of
the most unsafe and environmentally unsound places in New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the floating corpses and seething typhus in its
130-year lore, today's Gowanus Canal is not quite the same
notorious place it was only a few weeks ago. On May 3, the city
finally replaced a propeller-driven ``flushing tunnel'' that broke
about 30 years ago. The large new gizmo is oddly misnamed, since it
does not actually flush the infectious stew out of the canal, but
rather nudges the sewage and toxic ``black mayonnaise,'' as locals
sometimes call it, slowly toward New York Harbor. Nevertheless, for
all but a few people in the area, any extra movement in the Gowanus
is viewed as progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prior to the flushing tunnel, a dead dog would just float back
and forth with the tides between Third Street and Carroll for maybe
a week,'' explained David Lefkowitz, whose real estate office seems
perilously close to the canal. ``Now, the thing could be gone in
maybe 24 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Another bit of good news, which Lefkowitz insists is making him
consider the possibility of opening a restaurant overlooking the
Gowanus, is that the color of the water has changed. It now looks a
lot more like old-fashioned slime, he says, and a lot less like
antifreeze.
</P>
<P>
   If the canal is not exactly Venice, the new seven-foot flushing
propeller is apparently operating so well that the Gowanus is
starting to lose some of its oily luster and even its legendary
smell. A number of artists who regularly haunt the canal question
whether these improvements enhance the artistic value of the
Gowanus or merely taint it.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the two-mile stretch has attracted painters,
sculptors, photographers, film makers and at least one dancer and
his accompanying musician. An artists' co-op _ where the water is
said to be good only for mixing paints _ operates in an old
warehouse a few dozen feet away. A houseboat on the canal has been
converted into a stained-glass studio. While others may have
spotted some rather unhealthy things floating in this canal, these
creative types see the muse.
</P>
<P>
   Allison Prete, whose recent film about the canal, ``Lavender
Lake,'' has something of a cult following in Brooklyn, struggles to
explain the lure of an atmosphere so fetid that on bad days it
seems to activate an ancient warning system in the brain. After a
rainstorm, when the sewers continue to overflow into the canal, the
nose gets a particularly urgent message that this is not a healthy
place to hang around.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, humans persist, surviving on cheap rents and stories about
the robber who died trying to get away from police by swimming
across the canal or jokes about how the Gowanus is good for the
sinuses. There are also new signs of betterment _ fresh paint, a
pleasure boat taking anxious visitors on a canal tour, ``for sale''
signs on empty buildings that were once part of the Gowanus
wasteland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody thinks they're discovering something,'' Ms. Prete
says, trying to explain the fascination.
</P>
<P>
   Spencer Finch, for example, discovered his art form on one of
those hot August days when the canal is particularly noticeable. He
decided to portray not what he saw but what he smelled. The result
is his Gowanus series of pastels, which is heavy on colors like
puce, pink and chartreuse.
</P>
<P>
   Like other creative types who know the area well, Finch is
concerned that artists' inspirations will be overcome by
developers' fantasies. A cleaner Gowanus ``in some ways makes it
less appealing,'' he admits. But then, it's not yet August.

 &HT;    Republicans rail against gun control
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Alan Judd and Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ From Republican presidential candidates to a
leading official of the National Rifle Association, speakers at the
Georgia Republican Party's annual convention in Augusta Friday and
Saturday argued that societal change and enforcement of existing
gun laws would be the most effective ways to prevent shootings like
the ones that injured six people Thursday at Heritage High School
in the Atlanta suburb of Rockdale County and left 15 dead last
month in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those two horrible kids'' who went on a rampage in Colorado
broke 20 federal and state gun laws, said Wayne LaPierre, the NRA's
executive vice president, whose appearance Saturday after the
Georgia school shootings had caused an internal party dispute.
``You could have put another 50 laws on the books and they would
have broken those, too. ... How about blaming the people who pull
the trigger, set off the bombs and do the killing?''
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre's views seemed prevalent among the 2,000 Georgia GOP
activists who attended the convention. The only speaker expected to
differ _ Republican presidential candidate Elizabeth Dole _
canceled her appearance because she was suffering from laryngitis.
</P>
<P>
   Speakers who rejected calls for more gun control were warmly
welcomed by the delegates, and LaPierre received a partial standing
ovation after his 15-minute speech. Ron Jackson, a candidate for
state party chairman, drew prolonged cheers when he declared to the
delegates, ``I am a 30-year member of the National Rifle
Association and damn proud of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue of guns and violence in public schools dominated the
two-day convention, which was supposed to serve as a showcase for
Republican presidential contenders and to select a new state
chairman to lead the party after its 1998 defeats.
</P>
<P>
   None of the gun control supporters who had been expected
actually showed up to demonstrate outside the Augusta Civic Center.
But inside, all but a few speakers addressed the gun issue. Most
contended that President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore had
exploited recent school shootings to win support for more gun
restrictions. They also blamed the violence on a permissive society
that has no moral compass.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I was a kid, if somebody came to school with a shaved
head, wearing a trench coat and celebrating Hitler's birthday, the
headmaster would have had him against the wall or sent him home,
and the ACLU wouldn't have been a factor in the equation,'' said
one presidential candidate, magazine publisher Steve Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   Another contender, anti-abortion activist Alan Keyes, told the
delegates: ''We don't need more gun control. We need more control
over the judges that are taking God's name out of our schools and
prayer out of our schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other candidates _ former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander and
conversative activist Gary Bauer _ expressed similar sentiments
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But it was LaPierre, and his repeated attacks on what he called
''made-for-TV lawmaking,'' that drew some of the loudest support
from convention delegates.
</P>
<P>
   He never mentioned the Conyers, Ga., shooting, instead confining
himself to a general assault against the Clinton administration for
refusing to enforce existing federal gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   While thousands of convicted felons have attempted to buy guns
or have used them in crimes, he said, officals under Clinton have
refused to prosecute those crimes. That, he said, proves a gun bill
that cleared the Senate on Thursday with the support of the
administration is ''phony.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody knows what the real agenda was in pushing that gun
legislation, and it sure wasn't about keeping children safe,''
LaPierre said. ''These are people ... who are brick by brick trying
to take the Second Amendment apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Although LaPierre's brief appearance _ the result of a 4-month
old invitation by party leaders _ had caused some division in the
GOP ranks, the only fallout was that the highly publicized speech
eclipsed the late afternoon balloting for state party chairman.
Delegates selected Chuck Clay of Marietta as their leader for the
next two years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It might come across as a little insensitive,'' said Bob Lane,
a convention delegate from Conyers who had initially questioned
LaPierre's role on the agenda. ''But it was concidence that it
happened at this time. I'm willing to listen to his side.''

EDITORIAL: INNOCENTS ON DEATH ROW 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Sunday, May 23:
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Illinois exonerated Ronald Jones for the rape and
murder that was scheduled to send him to his death. When DNA tests
were finally performed eight years after he was sentenced to die,
they proved that the crime could not have been committed by Jones,
who says that he confessed because Chicago police beat him
severely. Since Illinois reinstated the death penalty in 1977, it
has executed 12 men. It has also exonerated 12 after they were able
to prove their innocence. Some had come within days of execution.
</P>
<P>
   It is the rare death-row inmate who does not claim to be
innocent. But many states are finding, to their horror, that it is
not a rarity that this claim is true. Jones is one of some 79 men
and women released from death row since the modern death penalty
began in 1973 _ one for every seven people executed. A wrongful
conviction, of course, means that the real killer has gone free.
The revelations of wrongful convictions are having an unusual
political effect on the death penalty, giving support to bills in
several states that would block executions until the death penalty
was applied more justly. Some are even supported by vocal
death-penalty proponents. New York, however, is moving in the wrong
direction.
</P>
<P>
   The exonerations are not a sign that the system works. The
innocence of many death-row prisoners was discovered only because
outsiders went to great time and expense to investigate when the
courts would not. The Innocence Project at Cardozo School of Law in
New York, founded by Peter Neufeld and the DNA expert Barry Scheck,
has helped to free seven death-row inmates. Students at
Northwestern University working with a journalism professor, David
Protess, found the evidence that exonerated three of those on death
row in Illinois. No system that requires college students to
provide justice can be called functional. There is no way to know
how many innocent people have been executed because the dead do not
search for champions to prove their case.
</P>
<P>
   Only Florida, with 18 exonerations, has had more than Illinois,
but it is likely that other states also have many innocents on
death row. Alabama pays defense lawyers a maximum of $2,000 in a
capital case, and other states pay not much more. Such meager fees
often buy minimal or no defense, which greatly increases the
possibility of a wrongful conviction. In addition, statutes and
judicial decisions at the state and federal levels have limited
courts' abilities to review the claims of death-row prisoners. Some
states have executed people with credible evidence of innocence
because their claims were raised too late or had other technical
glitches. Congress and many states have also cut financing, in some
cases to zero, for lawyers who represent convicted death-row
inmates for their appeals. Some convicts with serious arguments of
innocence, then, simply cannot get heard.
</P>
<P>
   The American Bar Association in 1997 called for a moratorium on
executions until the death penalty could be administered fairly and
with less risk to the innocent. The high-profile exonerations have
increased support for a moratorium in various states. In March, the
Illinois House passed a resolution calling for a moratorium on
executions and setting up an independent group to study the
application of the death penalty in the state. Illinois is also
likely to increase funds for death-penalty lawyers. In Nebraska,
death-penalty supporters and opponents joined to pass a law last
week that would stop executions for two years.
</P>
<P>
   New York, however, is taking steps that could make wrongful
convictions more likely. Gov. George Pataki is seeking to expand
the death penalty. Chief Judge Judith Kaye, apparently bowing to
criticism from the governor, recently reduced fees for capital
defense lawyers. Prisoners Legal Services, the group that would
monitor conditions on death row, is in danger of closing unless the
hostile Pataki and the Legislature can agree on its financing.
</P>
<P>
   Even supporters of the death penalty should be strong advocates
of measures that would give everyone accused of a capital crime a
competent and adequately paid lawyer. Every death-row resident
needs access to DNA testing, a decent attorney and the chance to
introduce evidence of innocence no matter when it is uncovered.
This page has long opposed the death penalty in all cases. But even
its most ardent supporters should be troubled by the likelihood
that people are being executed for crimes they did not commit.

REAL ESTATE: PROPERTY OWNERS NEED TO RESPOND TO TENANTS WITH
DISABILITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JAY ROMANO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York City Commission on Human Rights has
issued a wake-up call of sorts to property owners _ including co-op
and condominium boards as well as landlords _ about discriminating
against tenants with disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   In a decision in a case involving a wheelchair-bound shareholder
and a co-op on Central Park West in Manhattan, the commission
ordered the co-op to construct a ramp for the shareholder to use to
enter the building, to install automatic door openers on elevators
and in the building's lobby, and to pay the shareholder $15,000 in
compensation for the mental anguish caused by the co-op's failure
to provide ``reasonable accommodations'' when the shareholder
requested them.
</P>
<P>
   The $15,000 award was $5,000 more than a recommendation in a
report by an administrative law judge that formed the basis for the
commission's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commission's decision and order puts co-ops and their
boards in the five boroughs on notice that disability-based
discrimination is absolutely illegal under the city's Human Rights
Law, and that violators will be called to account by the Commission
on Human Rights,'' the commission chairwoman, Marta B. Varela, said
in a press release issued with the decision on March 8.
</P>
<P>
   Randolph E. Wills, the deputy commissioner in charge of the
commission's Law Enforcement Bureau, said that the Human Rights Law
requires property owners to make reasonable accommodations so that
residents with disabilities can enjoy the same rights as those
without disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   And, Wills said, in the case in question, that included the
right of a shareholder who used a wheelchair ``to leave her
building without fear of having to beg a car service driver or
other stranger for assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   John Herrion, assistant program counsel for the Eastern
Paralyzed Veterans Association in Jackson Heights, Queens, said
that the shareholder, Ronnie Ellen Raymond, who was diagnosed with
multiple sclerosis in 1990, had experienced increasing difficulty
with balance and negotiating stairs.
</P>
<P>
   Herrion, who represented Ms. Raymond in the case against the
co-op at 325 Central Park West, at 92d Street, said that despite
the fact that the shareholder offered to pay for installation of a
sidewalk ramp at the building's entrance stairs, the co-op board
rejected her offer.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Herrion said, the board decided to install an exterior
lift that could transport a person in a wheelchair from street
level down into a ``moat'' that ran along the front of the
building. Once in the moat, the person in the wheelchair would then
be able to enter the building through a basement door and from
there enter the elevator. That arrangement, Herrion said, was not
acceptable to Ms. Raymond and did not satisfy the ``reasonable
accommodation'' provision of the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board was essentially saying to the shareholder, `You can
use the back door,''' he said. ``But the Human Rights Commission
agreed that our request for the ramp was a reasonable one.'' Mara
B. Levin, the co-op's lawyer, declined comment on the decision or
on whether the board will appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Real estate lawyers say the decision puts all property owners on
notice that they must take seriously any request for special
accommodations made by a disabled resident. ``I've been dealing
with several cases like this myself,'' said C. Jaye Berger, a
Manhattan real estate lawyer. ``But the problem with the Human
Rights Law is that there are no clear parameters to guide you.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Berger said that while the law clearly requires property
owners to make ``reasonable accommodations'' for disabled
residents, it is impossible to define that term in the abstract.
</P>
<P>
   ``A decision like this is extremely scary for a co-op,'' she
said. ``There's a huge potential for a building to have serious
claims. And the Human Rights Commission wields such broad authority
to decide what is appropriate, you have to take every request by a
disabled tenant quite seriously and engage in a lot of creative
thinking.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bruce Cholst, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that the recent
decision _ along with an apparent increase in the number of elderly
residents who choose to remain in their apartments as they grow
older _ makes it necessary for boards to prepare for requests for
reasonable accommodations in any number of different situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a slow-motion time-bomb in the early stages of
exploding,'' Cholst said, adding that there are two distinct
aspects of what may be required to provide a reasonable
accommodation for a disabled tenant or shareholder. ``One is
whether to make physical changes to the building,'' he said, ``and
the other is whether to suspend or change rules already in place.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, an older tenant would not have to be
disabled _ in the traditional sense of the word _ to have
difficulty opening heavy lobby or elevator doors. Nonetheless,
Cholst said, it would probably be appropriate in such a case for a
property owner to choose to install automatic doors like the ones
ordered by the commission in the Raymond case.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he said, a board being asked to make a
reasonable accommodation for a person who has a need for a pet for
companionship might have to contemplate rule changes if there is a
no-pet rule in the building.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Cholst said, it may also be possible for a
property owner to provide a reasonable accommodation for an older
or disabled tenant without having to resort to changing the rules
or the physical layout of the building, if all parties strive to
remain reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is usually at issue is not whether something needs to be
done, but how to do it,'' he said. ``If you have a disabled person
in a wheelchair, it might be possible for a neutral person _ maybe
even a paid mediator _ to assure the resident that having a
building staff person always available to help them up a short
flight of stairs would be a reasonable alternative to constructing
a ramp.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Cholst said, one of the elements of ``reasonableness''
is whether a proposed solution to a problem is economically
feasible and practically achievable.
</P>
<P>
   ``A reasonable accommodation is one that does not impose undue
hardship on the property owner,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Greenstein, another Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that
property owners _ particularly co-op and condominium associations
in which tenants are owners _ must also prepare for the inevitable
increase in the number of building residents who will have special
needs as they grow older.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most boards are pretty good at dealing with financial planning
and capital improvement planning,'' he said. ``But now they have to
start thinking about people planning, too.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Greenstein said, the best way to address a request for
help from a disabled or aging resident is to do so as quickly as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm seeing more and more people come to boards saying they
need better accommodations, better access to the building,''
Greenstein said. ``And in many cases, even though the board is
making a good-faith attempt to help the tenant, they may seem to be
a little slow in responding.''
</P>
<P>
   When that happens, he said, the resident may perceive the slow
response as an indication that the board does not sincerely wish to
cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   ``And once a complaint gets filed,'' Greenstein said, ``it's
much more difficult to keep the discussion on a friendly basis.''

 &HT;    Wounded teen forgives school shooter
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Duane D. Stanford and Peter Scott
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONYERS, Ga. _ On her way out of Rockdale Hospital Saturday,
Cania Cullins said she is no longer angry with the Heritage High
School shooter who put a .22-caliber slug in her knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just learn to forgive people regardless, and just go on with
my life,'' the 15-year-old said before exchanging a wheelchair for
crutches and climbing into a Ford van for the ride home.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Cania will be riding in a limousine to be sent by Pastor
Jim Earl Swilley of Church In The Now, where Cania has worshipped
for more than two years. Cania and hundreds of fellow church
members will gather there to pray and celebrate life three days
after she and five others were wounded by a fellow student.
</P>
<P>
   As Cania recounted the shooting to local and national reporters
in the hospital on the north side of Conyers, students visited the
high school south of Conyers to collect their belongings now that
authorities have finished gathering evidence. The building was
opened for four hours Saturday morning and then closed again.
</P>
<P>
   As students filed in, a half-dozen maintenance workers pruned
the campus landscaping. Inmates from the Rockdale County jail
picked up trash on the grounds. Across the street from the school,
media camped out next to a handmade sign on a stake at the entrance
to the Heritage Heights subdivision that read, ``Good Luck
Seniors''
</P>
<P>
   Fawne Derosia, 17, was one of the first students to enter the
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frightening being in there knowing what happened,'' she
said after a gaggle of reporters stopped her on her way out of the
school's parking lot, which was restricted to students.
</P>
<P>
   Students said the area of the shooting had been cleared. Many of
the book bags that were scattered Thursday had been collected and
put in the teacher's lounge for students to pick up. Others
remained in the classrooms where they had been dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Freshman Allan Duncan came to the school briefly to retrieve
some notebooks from his locker that he needed for science and
English classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very chaotic Thursday and when I walked in there today
it brought back lots of bad memories,'' he said, recalling that he
had seen fellow student Jason Cheek get shot.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore Alexis Diamond said she felt an ``eeriness'' when she
entered the building to look for her black jacket. She plans to
come to school Monday, but does not plan to stay for the remainder
of the school term. Students have been given the option of skipping
final exams.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took our security away,'' Alexis said of the 15-year-old
shooter.
</P>
<P>
   Another sophomore, Susan Dunn, found her bookbag open, which is
not the way she remembers leaving it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt very empty,'' she said of being in the school.
</P>
<P>
   Cania said she isn't ready to return to school. Her experience
is still too fresh in her mind, and she wants more time to recover
from Friday's surgery to remove a bullet from her knee.
</P>
<P>
   Cania was with her friend Shaquita Usher, 16, in the school
cafeteria when she heard what she called a ``loud pop'' that she
thought was a fire cracker or balloon popping. After hearing the
sounds again, Cania and Usher hit the floor and began to crawl to
the back of the lunchroom. That's when she felt something sting her
leg.
</P>
<P>
   Pushed by panicking classmates, Cania crawled under a table,
crying. She told her friend she was shot, although the wound didn't
seem to hurt. Cheek, who had been shot twice in the attack, tried
to help, Cania said. After the shooting stopped. Cania said she
remained under the table for what seemed like three to five
minutes. Cafeteria workers brought her ice and cold rags to put on
her wound until paramedics arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Cania's mother, Felecia, was on Ga. 400 on the way back from
work at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Buckhead when she heard news of
the shooting on the radio. She pulled off at a Firestone tire
store, where she found a television on which to watch news
coverage. Seeing no evidence of her daughter, she called work to
see if authorities had tried to contact her. Co-workers said they
had, and that Cania had been shot.
</P>
<P>
   Cania's mother sped through DeKalb right past a motorcycle cop.
Figuring she had better explain, she waved the officer over and
pulled to the side of the road. The officer told her he understood
none of the injuries were life threatening. She then went to
Rockdale Hospital, where she found her daughter shaken, but alive.

REPUBLICANS SEE A CHANCE TO CLOSE THE GENDER GAP IN 2000  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For Democrats, women have been like money in the
bank.
</P>
<P>
   They helped put Bill Clinton in the White House twice. They
stood by him in the scandal over his relationship with a White
House intern.
</P>
<P>
   They also helped the party pick up four Senate seats last year
when political tradition and forecasts predicted defeats.
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, when they stay home, as they did in the 1994
congressional elections, Democrats lose _ badly.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans see an opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of Texas Gov. George W. Bush as a presidential
contender and the candidacy of Elizabeth Dole offer signs that this
Democratic lifeline could fray in the 2000 campaign.
</P>
<P>
   According to several surveys, both Bush and Dole beat Vice
President Al Gore in early presidential match-ups. And it's women
who give them the edge. In a Gallup Poll, Dole was ahead by 14
percentage points among women, Bush by 12.
</P>
<P>
   Strategists caution that Bush and Dole are not well-known beyond
their famous names and that the public's mood will shift many times
before November 2000. Several, however, worry about a weakness in a
core Democratic constituency.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats need as many women as possible, because they
have been losing men,'' said Harriett Woods, former president of
the bipartisan National Women's Political Caucus and a former
Democratic lieutenant governor of Missouri. ``The Republicans don't
need all the women, they just need enough women to supplement.''
</P>
<P>
   Also, two events this spring could significantly affect the 2000
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   One is if first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton decides to run for
the Senate in New York. If she does, Gore _ assuming he defeats
Democrat Bill Bradley for the nomination _ could get a bounce.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest problem we have in my business is apathy,'' said
Ellen Malcolm, president of Emily's List, a network of women who
donate money to Democrats. ``Hillary Clinton is going to blow
apathy apart in that race.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The second event is the gun-control debate. Women favor more gun
control, and they trust Democrats more than Republicans to do
something about it _ just as they do on improving education and
health care, two other chief concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Their faith was rewarded last week.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the deaths of 14 high school students and a
teacher in Colorado, and on the very day that a student wounded six
classmates in Georgia, Democrats won a big victory in the Senate by
passing the first strict gun-control measure in five years.
</P>
<P>
   And Gore basked in the glow of what could become a crucial
campaign moment. As president of the Senate, he cast the vote that
broke a 50-50 tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guns, equal pay, the environment _ when people focus and
realize the vice president is on the good side of those issues,''
said Chris Lehane, Gore's press secretary, ``he's going to fare
extremely well.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Laszlo, a Democratic consultant, said Gore's problems
with women echoed his standing with all voters _ it's hard to
articulate his vision without seeming to disagree with the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   The gun-control bill could start turning Gore's fortunes around
with women. Republican opposition allowed the Democrats to paint
them as political captives of the gun lobby.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Flemming, a survey director of the Pew Research Center for
the People and the Press, said Democrats could benefit if the issue
stayed hot.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would certainly sustain the gender gap, if not increase
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gender gap'' describes differences in attitudes on issues and
voting choices between women and men. In numbers, it reflects the
proportion of women's vote and men's vote captured by a winning
candidate. In 1996, Bill Clinton's 11-point gender gap was the
largest ever recorded in a presidential contest.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republican leaders recognize that winning the White House
and holding their slim majority in Congress could depend on how
much they narrow that gap.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jennifer Dunn, a Republican from Washington and a Bush ally
in the House, said women represent 53 percent of the electorate,
yet the typical Republican enters a race already 17 points down in
the number of women supporters compared with the number of men.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's huge,'' she said. But the wound has been
self-inflicted, she said. The party's message when it took over
Congress in 1994 was too harsh, particularly toward the concerns of
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just don't say you want to cut out the Department of
Education and leave it that,'' Dunn said. ``People assume you don't
care about education.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican women, she said, are looking for ``an upbeat,
optimistic candidate'' such as Dole, or Bush, in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Linda DiVall, Dole's pollster, referred to Bush and Dole as
``nonthreatening Republicans'' who lower the rhetoric. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dole has spoken out about guns. She distanced herself early from
the rest of her party by backing child-safety locks and an assault
weapons ban and by opposing the right to carry concealed weapons.
Bush has supported some gun restrictions but has not been nearly as
vocal on the issue. He also signed a bill to allow the carrying of
concealed weapons in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Dole are also against abortion, but both have said the
party should concentrate on more-achievable goals such as banning
late-term abortions. They have been called ``compassionate
conservatives,'' a new term that embraces some conservative and
some centrist viewpoints.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, most Americans know little about them beyond the
fact that Bush's father and namesake was president and that Dole's
husband, former Sen. Bob Dole, ran for the White House in 1996.
Voters can give them whatever viewpoints they hope to see
expressed, which may account for their high poll numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats take comfort in the fact that the political dynamic
will change once Bush begins to campaign next month and he and Dole
have to take more specific stands on ``women's issues.''
</P>
<P>
   That's just fine, DiVall said. Both candidates can handle it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is having a difficult time stepping outside from the
shadows of the vice presidency and the larger magnetic charms of
Bill Clinton,'' she said. ``Women in particular find the Dole
candidacy a very intriguing historic opportunity, and swing voters
who might have been with Gore in the past are shopping around and
looking at Bush and Dole.''

MISSOURI WOMAN OVERCOMES PHYSICAL DISABILITIES TO EARN PH.D. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TRISHA L. HOWARD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lawrence, Kan. _ Denise Lance almost didn't make it to her
graduation day.
</P>
<P>
   She was born with her umbilical cord wrapped around her neck,
depriving her of oxygen in the first few minutes of her life.
</P>
<P>
   The result: severe cerebral palsy.
</P>
<P>
   She learned to walk with the help of braces. When her elementary
school asked that she not use crutches, because other students
might trip over them, she walked on her knees. Now she doesn't need
crutches at all.
</P>
<P>
   She used to type her assignments by holding a stick in each hand
and pecking out the letters on her typewriter. Computer programs
that could translate the spoken word into the written would not
work for Lance, because her speech is unintelligible at times.
Then, her parents bought her a regular computer, and she discovered
that she could type faster with her toes.
</P>
<P>
   Lance, 30, has never been one to focus on what she cannot do.
She would rather share what she has done.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday she celebrated her biggest achievement yet when she
walked across the stage at the University of Kansas' Lied Center to
receive her doctorate in special education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first time somebody talked to me about it, I thought they
were kidding,'' said Lance, who lives north of Independence, Mo.
``I didn't know if I could get a B.A., let alone a Ph.D.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Lance wants to share with special-education teachers her
knowledge about disabilities and assistive technology.
</P>
<P>
   Not enough teachers know about the new resources available, said
Lance, who has talked about and demonstrated her toe-typing skills
at conferences.
</P>
<P>
   Special software allows her to type in abbreviations, which are
then translated into words. Her keyboard is mounted to a footrest.
</P>
<P>
   Lance taught herself how to design Web pages and launched her
own site about assistive technology. On her ``to-do'' list is a
book that offers suggestions for adapting computers to special
needs for less than $100.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot that teachers don't know about technology, so
kids aren't getting what they need,'' Lance said. ``Schools just
have to provide enough so kids can pass from grade to grade, but it
might not be enough for them to live up to their potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's the sad part...that people have low
expectations for children with disabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Lance and her parents, Dorothy and Calvin Lance, know firsthand
about low expectations.
</P>
<P>
   When Lance was 4, doctors advised her parents that test results
showed her to be mentally impaired. Two years later, Lance's
first-grade teacher told Dorothy that her daughter was too smart to
stay in special- education classes.
</P>
<P>
   Another teacher kept Lance from participating in student
council, even after her classmates elected her to serve, her mother
said. When Dorothy Lance confronted the teacher, the teacher asked:
``Well, what can she do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the worst year of my life,'' Denise Lance said.
</P>
<P>
   For every doubter, Lance also had fans. Heidi Wiggins grew up
next door to Lance in Buckner, and the two became fast friends. If
people stared when the two girls went shopping, Wiggins would stare
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was really brave to go to public school,'' Wiggins said.
``People didn't understand what was wrong with her, that she was
not mentally handicapped, just physically.''
</P>
<P>
   What Lance couldn't do on her own, her mother helped her do.
Dorothy drove Lance to her classes at William Jewell College in
Liberty, Mo., and at KU, making the 75-minute trip to Lawrence up
to four times a week. Dorothy also feeds, bathes and dresses her
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were things that I couldn't do for myself,'' Lance said,
``so I learned to let people help me.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as a kid, Lance didn't let the physical limitations slow
her down. When the other children in her neighborhood got bicycles,
she begged her parents for one. Her father, a retired machinist,
equipped Lance's bike with braces _ a sturdier version of training
wheels _ to keep it from tipping over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I couldn't do something,'' Lance said. ``Even
when other people said I couldn't, I didn't believe them.''
</P>
<P>
   She graduated from Fort Osage High School in 1987 and that fall
started classes at Jewell. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Aides took notes for Lance in class. Even so, she spent 12 hours
a day, seven days a week, doing her schoolwork. She still used her
typewriter and hand-held sticks to complete her assignments _ at a
pace of eight words a minute. The physical strain was crushing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard to keep up,'' she said. ``That was the first time
I really felt handicapped.''
Lance dropped out after a semester, hoping that physical and speech
therapy would improve her abilities. It didn't. She went back to
college anyway.
</P>
<P>
   She started toe-typing in her junior year. Four years after her
return, she graduated with a double major in English and psychology
_ and a 3.86 grade point average. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ann Marie Shannon, a retired professor of English, remembers
when Lance enrolled in an upper-level Shakespeare course in her
third semester at William Jewell. Shannon worried that the course
was too difficult for any underclassman, but by the end of the
semester, she was convinced that Lance was no typical student. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some students who have a particular confidence, and
the drive it takes to study for several years,'' Shannon said.
``Denise enjoyed literature so much _ and she was so astute _ that
she could have gotten a Ph.D. in English.''
</P>
<P>
   Lance had a similar effect on Steve Colson, an assistant
professor in KU's special-education department and one of her
doctoral advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Lance's extraordinary characteristic is that she doesn't seem
very extraordinary at all, Colson said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Colson grew accustomed to the sight of Lance tapping out notes
with her toes. She met deadlines, never asked for special treatment
and did not complain, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I soon became aware that I was just seeing her as another
student, not as a student who has a disability,'' Colson said.
</P>
<P>
   Lance wants to teach in a university classroom, preferably close
to home. She did her student teaching online but prefers human
interaction. A voice synthesizer turns her written words into
lectures. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Not much stands between Lance and her dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a difference between being handicapped and being
disabled,'' Lance said. ``I will always have a disability, but I
don't have to be handicapped by it.''

HEALTH-CARE INDUSTRY FIGHTS YEAR 2000 BUG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FINN BULLERS and JULIUS A. KARASH  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, MO. _ Some industries have already declared
victory, but hospitals, doctors and health insurers still are
straining to battle the Y2K bug.
</P>
<P>
   That is one reason health care, which relies on computer
technology for everything from bypass surgery to billing, has come
under harsh criticism for its slowness to address year 2000
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the health-care industry deals with matters of life
and limb, you would think it would be the best prepared,'' said Don
Meyer, a spokesman for the U.S. Senate Specia Committee on the
Year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The medical industry acknowledges that it may go down to the
wire for Y2K fixes _ Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City, in
fact, has 100 people working full time to implement a new computer
system this year.
</P>
<P>
   But Y2K repairs have been going on for years, and they will be
done in time, spokesmen say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public can be confident that virtually every hospital and
a very large percentage of physician offices will continue to
operate normally,'' said Richard Corlin of the American Medical
Association. ``What we are likely to see are a series of annoyances
rather than a series of catastrophes.''
</P>
<P>
   Work is being done in two main areas: medical equipment, much of
which relies on embedded computer chips; and billing, which runs on
computer networks. The American Hospital Association says the
industry will spend $8.2 billion to exterminate the computer bug.
</P>
<P>
   While the industry says the job will be done, critics are far
less optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   In a report released a month ago, the President's Council on
Year 2000 Conversion said the health-care sector had ``not made
adequate progress in addressing the Year 2000 problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Bennett, a Utah Republican who leads the Senate's
year 2000 Committee, said the industry's ``current readiness levels
are amongst the lowest of any industry in the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, Bennett's committee heard one of the most ominous
predictions from the Rx2000 Solutions Institute, a Y2K
medical-industry watchdog group in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are convinced the American health-care community is in
deeply serious trouble due to anticipated problems of the year 2000
changeover,'' said Joel Ackerman, Rx2000 director. ``Rx2000
believes that patient care, and indeed patient lives, are at
stake.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials bristle when they hear that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public does not have to be panicked into thinking that
physicians or hospitals are ignoring the situation,'' Corlin said.
``We're paying a great deal of attention to (Y2K), and most
facilities will work just fine.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In April the hospital association reported that 13 percent of
the hospitals surveyed were Y2K compliant and that 81 percent were
``moving toward Y2K compliance without major difficulty.''
</P>
<P>
   And on May 12 the American Medical Group Association released a
study showing that 11 percent of the 45,000 physicians it
represents in 40 states said their practices were Y2K ready,
although only half the members responded by the deadline. Of those,
96 percent said they would be ready by Dec. 31.

WITH ROOTS IN THE CEMENT INDUSTRY, SURVIVES IN A BOOK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; txr:ILASCO, Mo. _ The world knows where Ilasco is.
</P>
<P>
   Not by name, although it's on the official state highway map.
Not by size, because only a dozen people live here.
</P>
<P>
   Yet anyone who reads knows Ilasco's location.
</P>
<P>
   Ilasco, you see, abuts the malevolent cave in The Adventures of
Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain _ the claustrophobic, dripping cave, with
Becky and Tom lost in the blackness with only their flickering
candles, and somewhere in that darkness the menacing Injun Joe.
</P>
<P>
   Ilasco is just south of Hannibal, Mo., and hard by the bluffs
that cloak, among others, the Mark Twain cave, now a relentlessly
promoted tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
   What's left of this once booming town is a smattering of houses
on the east side of Missouri 79, structures that are dwarfed by the
bustling Continental Cement Co. plant across the road, with the
second-longest cement kiln in the world.
</P>
<P>
   So the ``where'' of Ilasco is familiar. But its ``who, what,
when and how'' had largely been forgotten until three years ago
when, curiously enough, another book appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of another tale by Twain, it was scholarly in approach,
encyclopedic in breadth, and a revelation of time and place. City
of Dust, A Cement Company Town in the Land of Tom Sawyer, by Gregg
Andrews, has become a linchpin of sorts for a metamorphic revival
of Ilasco.
</P>
<P>
   The book, residents say straightaway, assures Ilasco will be
remembered.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, City of Dust has around here become known simply as
``the book.'' Ask a question, the book appears and pages turn.
</P>
<P>
   When did the Atlas Portland Cement Co., the first of several
owners of the facility that employs 225 workers, first buy land
here? In 1901. When did production start? In 1903. And who named
Ilasco? It was L.P. Sprout, an Atlas chemist, who coined the
acronym for some of the ingredients used to make cement _ iron,
lime, aluminum, silica, calcium and oxygen _ Ilasco.
</P>
<P>
   There was more. There once were 3,000 people, speaking a babel
of languages, who lived and loved here while cement was shipped to
the Panama Canal, the Mississippi's locks and dams, an infinite
number of roads and bridges, the Empire State Building, even St.
Louis' Busch Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Who recollected Ilasco's labor union militancy and the state
militia arriving in 1910; the churches, schools, taverns, gardens,
and even a communal pasture for family cows; or that into 1950s
Ilasco still more resembled a hodgepodge eastern European
settlement than any grid-constructed Missouri town?
</P>
<P>
   Who remembered the specifics of questionable land deals and
murders, the chemistry of cement and the machinations of
turn-of-the century capitalists, European immigration patterns
between 1900 and 1930, and that Jim Burge's right arm, irreparably
mangled in a rock mill accident in 1906, was worth exactly $70?
</P>
<P>
   And who recalled that 30-odd years ago the town was literally
flattened almost overnight to expand the cement plant, create a
highway, and rid the area south of Hannibal of what some termed an
eyesore?
</P>
<P>
   Except for old-time Ilasco residents, not many.
</P>
<P>
   That's changing, said David Polc, who grew up here. A group of
old-time residents have become zealots in seeing that Ilasco's tale
be told, not just in Andrews' book, but also be put out in the open
where anybody can see it.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with what happened here from 1901 to 1970, said Polc,
the escapades of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn look pretty spare.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, about 500 people filled Hannibal's Knights
of Columbus hall to celebrate Ilasco's heritage; visit; dance;
listen to old tunes; eat Hungarian, German, Italian, Slovakian,
Romanian, Ukrainian, Polish and American food; and, above all,
raise money for a historical monument on Missouri 79, across from
the still-standing Holy Cross Catholic Church.
</P>
<P>
   As markers go, the one planned will be sizable. Tentatively
budgeted at $9,000, the stone will tell Ilasco's story on one side
and have the names of donors carved on the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We raised a bunch of money,'' said Sally Polc, David's wife.
``People want that memorial. They want some recognition for what
happened here all those years ago. Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn are
fine. But Ilasco was the America most people who came to this
country as immigrants knew.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Northcutt, whose kin worked at the cement plant and
remembers that Ilasco was always referred to as ``the village,''
never ``the town,'' said:
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the children of the last people who lived in Ilasco. We
have to do this. We have to tell our story for others to see. If we
don't, it'll be gone forever.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrews, an Ilasco native and an associate professor of history
at Southwest Texas University in San Marcos, said that when he was
a boy Ilasco's history amounted to little more than stories and
anecdotes told over dinner or out on the front porch.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got into my research, it was like a novel,'' Andrews
said. ``There was everything. You couldn't make this stuff up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gregg mentions it in his book, but the one thing I think back
about is the dust,'' said David Polc. ``It was so thick that you
could walk right into somebody. You wouldn't see them coming. The
wind would change and your mother would holler and you'd head for
the clothesline to get the laundry off.''
</P>
<P>
   Northcutt, in turn, remembered silicosis, the filling and
hardening of the lower lung sacs caused by years of breathing the
dust. Northcutt made the noise of heavy wheezing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can still hear that sound,'' he said. ``Young men who were
old men because their lungs were full of cement. It's a sound you
can't forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrew said that without the help of Ilasco's residents, he
never could have finished his book.
</P>
<P>
   Yet his educated background and the book's numerous footnotes
and scholastic origins worried Andrews a couple of years ago when
he came to Big River Discount Books in Hannibal for a signing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know what to expect,'' Andrews said. ``Here I was, a
local kid who'd become a college professor. What would the people
of Ilasco think? I hadn't pulled any punches.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrews needn't have worried. Extending out the door of the
bookstore and down Broadway was a seemingly endless line of people
with roots in Ilasco _ some from as far away as Michigan, Ohio and
Texas. Most had surnames that strangers would stumble over trying
to pronounce. They were waiting to buy one of the thickest, most
expensive ($37) and most scholarly books of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``That line of people said to me that they knew an unbelievable
story had happened in their town,'' Andrews said. ``And somebody
was validating what they'd been through by telling it.''

 &HT;    New Greek bishop enthroned in Atlanta
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS
 &HT;    
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Surrounded by mosaic apostles and saints and with
Jesus looking down from a dome overhead, Atlanta's new Greek
Orthodox bishop took his throne Saturday at the Cathedral of the
Annunciation in suburban Atlanta's DeKalb County.
</P>
<P>
   ``My beloved fellow bishop, you are entrusted with the very
authority that the Lord Jesus Christ entrusted to his apostles,''
said Archbishop Spyridon, head of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of
America, who presided over the installation.
</P>
<P>
   The hundreds of Greek Orthodox Christians who watched the
enthronement cheered their new bishop by shouting, ``Axios, Axios,
Axios,'' which means ``worthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta Episcopal Bishop Frank K. Allan and the Rev. Leland
Collins, the United Methodist clergyman who heads the Georgia
Christian Council, participated in the service along with about 65
Orthodox priests and monks and several Orthodox bishops.
</P>
<P>
   Allan praised the ``collegiality'' and ``dialogue'' between
Anglicans and Orthodox Christians. ``I wanted to be here to support
the new bishop,'' he said after the service. ``We need all the
support we can get.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is a great day for Georgia as well as a great
day for the Greek diocese,'' Collins said. ``We've been waiting
sometimes patiently, sometimes impatiently, for this day for two
years. Bishop Alexios, in the time he has been here, has show a
great ecumenical spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   The enthronement ceremony began with a long procession of a mass
choir leading blue and gold-garbed altar boys, who were in turn
followed by rows of priests, monks, bishops and lay leaders of the
diocese. Archbishop Spyridon and Bishop Alexios brought up the
rear.
</P>
<P>
   The procession moved through dozens of children, many in Greek
costume, waving gladioli. When Bishop Alexios reached the steps of
the Cathedral, the children surrounded him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're proud of him,'' said Nicole Paxton, 14, a student at
Brookwood High School in Gwinnett County.
</P>
<P>
   ``He works a lot with the youth,'' said her friend Mary
Katherine Patronis, a 16-year-old student at Pace Academy. ``He's a
wonderful people person. He's going to do great things for our
diocese.''
</P>
<P>
   Cathedral President George Vasilos compared Saturday's service
to a marriage ceremony. ``It's a wedding between the bishop and the
church,'' he said. ``This isn't like a corporation where you'll
serve for a few years and get transferred. Once you're made bishop,
this is your home.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexios, who was born on Christmas Day 1943 in Patras, Greece,
has served as temporary head of the Diocese of Atlanta since Jan.
1, 1997. The diocese had been vacant since the death of Bishop
Philip of Atlanta on Dec. 28, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   About 20,000 Greek Orthodox Christians are registered in the 65
parishes, four missions and four monasteries of the seven
Southeastern states in the Diocese of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech responding to his enthronment, Bishop Alexios said
his commitment to youth and promised to lead the church to help
them cope with problems from guns to drugs to interfaith marriages.
He also vowed to support the clergy of the diocese and to
evangelize on behalf of the church.
</P>
<P>
   Turning to the congregation, he said, ``All I ask of each one of
you is to give me_and through me to the diocese and through the
diocese to our Lord Jesus Christ_your time, talent and treasure.``
</P>
<P>
   He was not asking for money, he explained, but for love. ``I
pledge to you,''he said, ``that my love is unconditional.``
</P>
<P>
   Like a wedding followed by a reception, the solemn service was
followed by a festive banquet at a downtown hotel. There the new
bishop was saluted with the American and Greek national anthems and
an orchestral version of ``Georgia On My Mind.``
</P>
<P>
   Both Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell and DeKalb County CEO Liane
Levetan claimed him as their own, and both declared Saturday a day
in his honor in their respective jurisdictions.

CHRISTOS BASTIS, 95, MEDITERRANEAN SEAFOOD RESTAURATEUR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Fla., Iowa, Greece)   (bl)  
 By WILLIAM GRIMES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Christos G. Bastis, a restaurateur and art collector
whose Sea Fare restaurants brought a sophisticated Mediterranean
understanding of seafood to New York, died May 21 at his home in
Palm Beach, Fla. He was 95 and lived in Manhattan and Palm Beach.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when the typical American seafood restaurant was a
lobster shanty decorated with nets and cork, Bastis saw an
opportunity to serve traditional Mediterranean seafood dishes in
elegant surroundings and to broaden the taste of his customers by
presenting them with new kinds of fish.
</P>
<P>
   A courtly, urbane man, with charm to spare, Bastis lent an air
of sophistication to his restaurants simply by standing in them.
Little did his customers know that he personally scoured the Fulton
Fish Market before dawn every day, poking and probing his way
through the stalls to bring the cream of the catch back to his
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Christos George Bastis was born in Trikala, Greece, and grew up
in Volos, the principal port of Thessaly, where his father traded
in commodities.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking his fortune, Bastis left for the United States in 1922.
After being processed at Ellis Island, he boarded a train at
Pennsylvania Station with $8 in his pocket, and headed to Cedar
Rapids, Iowa, where his cousin owned Paradise Candy Co. He was put
to work as a soda jerk.
</P>
<P>
   After less than a year, Bastis returned to New York. ``Cedar
Rapids was too much like Volos to suit me,'' he later told an
interviewer. ``In America, I expected tall buildings, excitement
and big cars.''
</P>
<P>
   After settling into a furnished room on West 110th Street,
Bastis found work as a waiter at the Cadillac, a French restaurant,
where his career was brief. At his first table, a party of four
ordered in French. An uncomprehending Bastis smiled, nodded and
went through the motions of writing on his pad. ``I lifted their
menus from their hands, pocketed my pencil and walked into the
kitchen and out the back door,'' he recalled. ``I never went back,
and I've often wondered what they ate that night and how long it
took them to get it.''
</P>
<P>
   Bastis next found a job waiting tables at a small seafood
restaurant on Eighth Street in Greenwich Village. Soon he moved to
a better-paying counter job at the Fortis-Fisher cafeteria on West
49th Street, where he rose to the position of district manager.
After 10 years, he had saved enough to open his own restaurant,
Fougmar, at 43rd Street and Third Avenue. Two years later he opened
the Riviera, at 58th Street and Sixth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   After learning that his mother had fallen ill, Bastis sold the
Riviera in 1937 and returned to Volos, where he contracted
pleurisy. While recuperating, he found that his re-entry visa had
expired, and that he could not return to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   He remained in Greece, spending much of his time visiting art
museums, developing a passion that would eventually lead him to to
become a collector of ancient sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   He also studied the seafood recipes in local restaurants and
along the Riviera, with an eye to opening a restaurant in New York
that would reflect the style and traditions of the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941, Bastis returned to New York, where he reaped a windfall
when 300 barrels of olives that he had imported leapt in price
after war broke out between Italy and Greece. He used his profits
to open Sea Fare restaurant, at 41 W. Eighth Street in Greenwich
Village (in 1957 it moved across the street to 44 W. Eighth
Street).
</P>
<P>
   Although spare and simply furnished, the restaurant projected a
seriousness and sense of style that set it apart from what Bastis
called ``sawdust-on-the-floor places.'' Oysters were not just
oysters. They were identified as blue points, malpeques or
lynnhavens. Fish and only fish could be ordered as a main course.
Cooked to order, this ``good Neptunian provender,'' as the critic
Lawton Mackall put it, came with french fries and salad. Some
diners lingered for the Nesselrode pie, which became one of the
restaurant's signatures.
</P>
<P>
   In 1944, Bastis opened a second and grander Sea Fare, on First
Avenue near 57th Street. In 1963, he followed up with Sea Fare of
the Aegean, at 25 W. 56th St., which, as the name suggested,
featured dishes from Bastis' native region, like a
bouillabaisse-style soup from the island of Rhodes, and a casserole
of striped bass with clams. ``Nowhere in New York are the basic
products fresher, nowhere is fish so consistently boiled, poached
or fried to the right degree of doneness,'' wrote Mimi Sheraton of
The New York Times in a review in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Bastis sold the first two Sea Fare restaurants in 1974, focusing
his attention on Sea Fare of the Aegean, which he owned until
retiring in 1982. The opulently decorated restaurant, with its
Minoan columns and abstract paintings by Chen Chi, a Chinese
artist, had become the showpiece of Bastis' little chain. It also
served as an informal gallery for exhibiting sculptures from his
growing art collection, which would eventually consist of more than
200 objects, most of them works from ancient Greece, but also
including Etruscan, Cycladic, Egyptian, and Roman objects.
</P>
<P>
   He donated several of the works in his collection to the
Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Brooklyn Museum. More than 20
works are on permanent loan to the Met, and about 50 are on
permanent loan to the Brooklyn Museum. In 1987, 166 pieces from his
collection were presented by the Met in the exhibition
``Antiquities from the Collection of Christos G. Bastis.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his second wife, Josephine; a daughter, Betty
Peter, of Hartsdale, N.Y.; three sons: George, of Scarborough,
N.Y., Christopher, of Old Greenwich, Conn., and Jason, of Lloyd
Harbor, N.Y., seven grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Bastis was an honorary trustee of the Metropolitan Museum, a
member of the advisory committee to the board of trustees of the
Brooklyn Museum. He served as a trustee of the Onassis Foundation
and the Atlantic Bank of New York. He was an honorary chairman of
the board of the Foundation for Hellenic Culture.

IN N.H., GORE PUTS THE FOCUS ON RELIGION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL ZUCKMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DURHAM, N.H. _ Vice President Al Gore launched a new phase of
his presidential campaign Saturday as he invoked an Old Testament
story in a call for young people to master the temptations of evil
and sin.
</P>
<P>
   In a somber address on a sunny, celebratory day, the vice
president reminded the 2,400 students graduating from the
University of New Hampshire of the ceremony taking place at
Columbine High School in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still trying to understand, as a nation, why there are
empty chairs at that graduation ceremony,'' Gore said, referring to
the April 20 rampage that took 15 lives.
</P>
<P>
   While the nation is prospering, Gore said, there are new
challenges for families, children, and society. ``What can we do,
all of us, to build a future in which all children choose good over
evil?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president's address, delving into a theme rarely
addressed by Democratic politicians, represents an attempt to
accelerate his campaign and introduce the public to what the Gore
campaign says is the essence of his thinking and personality. It
also adds some emotion and sweep to an agenda that is just
beginning to take shape, with more talk of education and values,
and less talk of traffic congestion.
</P>
<P>
   Elaine Kamarck, Gore's senior policy adviser, said Republicans
should not have a lock on religious issues. ``The Democratic Party
is going to take back God this time,'' she said of the 2000 race.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is expected to elaborate on this theme in a speech Monday
to community activists in Atlanta by expounding on the need for
religion and faith-based organizations to help fight juvenile crime
and drug addiction in much the same way they helped welfare mothers
return to work.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's discussion of faith, both in Durham and at a forum on
safe schools at Dover High School, was prompted partly by the
violence at Columbine High School.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching children right from wrong, acting when signs of trouble
appear, taking guns away from children and criminals, and demanding
more responsibility from parents, Gore said, are all important. But
there is more to be done, he said, to change ``a toxic culture that
too often glorifies violence and cruelty.''
</P>
<P>
   Many children, said Gore, feel disconnected from, and rejected
and disrespected by, their communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my faith tradition, I am drawn to the story of the first
murder,'' Gore, a Southern Baptist who attended divinity school,
said to the 20,000 people gathered for the UNH graduation.
</P>
<P>
   In the book of Genesis, Cain's offering to God was rejected,
while Abel's was accepted, he said. God asked Cain why he was
angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you do well, will you not be accepted?'' Gore said God
asked. ``And if you do not do well, sin lyeth at your door. Its
desire is for you, but you must master it.''
</P>
<P>
   At Dover High School, Gore said the student shooters in
Columbine faced sin at their door in the form of Hitler's disciples
and teachings of hate on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They still had the duty to resist it or overcome it,'' Gore
said. ``It seems to me that they surrendered to it rather than
mastering it and overcoming it.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us have the capacity for both good or evil,'' he said,
comparing it to the ability to fight off an infection. ``If a child
feels connected and feels loved, . . . then that child is going to
be less vulnerable to the sin that comes along.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview after the speech, Gore said he has never tried
to impose his religious beliefs on others.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never worn my own religious commitment on my sleeve,'' he
said. ``I just think we have enough people from other parts of the
ideological spectrum doing that and I don't really go for that.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said he has always been drawn to religion, and he has not
hesitated to affirm his faith when asked. Over the years, however,
Gore said, a cynicism about religion has emerged where ``anybody
who believed in God and had a strong religious faith was sort of
weak-minded and irrational and silly. I always felt that was an
unfortunate mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that while he does not reject people who have
embraced atheism, ``I don't agree with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's venture into religion is unusual for a Democrat, said
John C. Green, a political scientist specializing in religion at
the University of Akron.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democratic Party has developed a large, secular
constituency of nonreligious people who don't react particularly
well to religious language,'' Green said. In the Republican Party,
on the other hand, references to religion are obligatory, he said,
particularly with regard to abortion restrictions, prayer in
school, and opposition to gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   With the shootings at Columbine and the disgust over President
Clinton's sexual escapades, Green said there is a vast hunger for
spirituality, meaning, and morality in everyday life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Addressing moral concerns can be very effective politically
and a way to thwart attempts of Republicans to occupy middle ground
by using religious language,'' Green said.
</P>
<P>
   In raising the subject of good versus evil, Gore pointed to the
Columbine shooters, Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris, as choosing
evil.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story from Genesis does have some parallel,'' Gore said in
the interview. ``These boys described themselves as outcasts and
felt rejected. They became vulnerable to a choice that can be
characterized as good and evil.''
</P>
<P>
   As he prepares to propose a greater involvement for faith-based
organizations Monday, Gore said each family needs to make its own
choices when it comes to religion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think somebody from the government ought to be
prescribing what religious beliefs any family should take,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But as a parent, Gore said, ``I think there is abundant evidence
that if religious observance is consistent with the value system of
that family, there are lots of benefits to children if they are
taught those values and traditions from their earliest years on.''

NATO BOMBS KOSOVO REBELS

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ NATO acknowledged Saturday the mistaken bombing of
a well-known Kosovar rebel stronghold inside Yugoslavia, an attack
that killed and injured forces fighting the Yugoslav Army. It was
the latest in a near-daily string of fatal errors that have plagued
the NATO air campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   A report by an international monitor said that one Kosovo
Liberation Army rebel was killed and 15 were wounded on the hilltop
post in Kosare. The KLA said seven of its guerrilla soldiers were
killed.
</P>
<P>
   NATO spokesman Jamie P. Shea said that military planners thought
the barracks 37 miles west of the Kosovo capital of Pristina,
seized by the guerrillas weeks earlier, still were occupied by
Yugoslav Army forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did strike that border command post,'' Shea told reporters
in Brussels. ``It was until very recently in the hands of the
Yugoslav Army, but it appears that it was then subsequently taken
over by the KLA.''
</P>
<P>
   The bombing was especially surprising because Western
journalists have been visiting the camp for the last two weeks, and
it has been shown on television regularly as an example of the
rebel army seizing back land formerly occupied by Yugoslav forces.
</P>
<P>
   KLA leader Hashim Thaci called the bombing a ``technical
mistake'' and said that despite the error, ``the NATO airstrikes
must continue, even more intensified.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, US officials sought to clarify why President
Clinton has asked NATO allies to mass 50,000 troops on the Kosovo
border. Pentagon spokesman Kenneth H. Bacon said that the troops
are not for an invasion, but are for a peacekeeping force that the
United States hopes eventually will be allowed into Kosovo. But US
officials clearly hoped that reports about the massing of troops on
the border would send a message to Belgrade that NATO is serious
about its demand and may be preparing for a ground war if
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   NATO members will meet next weekend in Brussels to work out the
details of the force. While some NATO countries, such as Britain,
have urged preparation for a ground war, other nations have urged a
temporary halt in the bombing to prod peace negotiations. In one
sign of NATO plans to boost the pressure on Belgrade, 18 F-18
fighters arrived Saturday at a base in the southern Hungarian town
of Taszar, and six more aircraft were expected there Sunday. The
bombing of the barracks overshadowed what NATO said was its busiest
night over Serbia, with 684 sorties, and its most devastating
attack yet on the Serbian electric power system. By early Saturday
afternoon, air raid sirens were sounding in Belgrade, and NATO jets
could be seen and heard overheard, suggesting another heavy 24-hour
period of bombing in the offing.
</P>
<P>
   At least 16 cities and towns across Serbia, including the
Yugoslav capital Belgrade, lost power when graphite bombs
short-circuited electrical transformers, the fourth-time NATO has
used so-called soft bombs to cut power.
</P>
<P>
   But for the first time, NATO also used conventional bombs to
destroy transformers at the Kolubara power plant south of Belgrade,
suggesting an escalation in NATO's plans to make conditions harder
on civilians and increase pressure on the government of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic to give in to NATO's demands.
</P>
<P>
   By midafternoon, technicians had repaired enough of the
equipment at Kolubara to restore power to about 20 percent of the
capital, but brownouts were common and the government-owned
electricity board accused NATO of trying to create a humanitarian
disaster by cutting power nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The Beta news agency reported that NATO's bombing had caused
complete blackouts in some major towns, including Cacak, Kraljevo,
Leskovac and Nis. Bombs also struck a residence of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO said it has hit hundreds of targets successfully, the
mistakes have attracted attention because they have sometimes
resulted in the deaths of the very people that the military
alliance is trying to help. NATO, for example, has acknowledged
striking refugee convoys and a hospital outside Belgrade. After
NATO bombs hit the Chinese Embassy on May 6, officials in Beijing
expressed outrage, temporarily deterring peace negotiations and
giving Milosevic a public relations bonanza.
</P>
<P>
   Among other developments Saturday:
</P>
<P>
   -- Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari briefed UN Secretary
General Kofi Annan on his talks with Russian Balkans envoy Viktor
S. Chernomyrdin and US Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott,
saying that ``we all see eye to eye'' on key issues. The talks
centered on a proposal for an international peacekeeping force, but
questions remains about NATO's demand that it take the lead role in
such an operation.
</P>
<P>
   -- Yugoslav forces freed an estimated 2,000 ethnic Albanians
from prison, where they had been held since trying to flee Kosovo.
``When the Serbs grabbed me, they said I was a terrorist,'' said
Sulejman Pec, 24. ``Sunday when they released me, they said, `You
are looking for NATO, so go find them.' ''
</P>
<P>
   -- After a lull, refugees once again began crossing the border
from Kosovo, with 3,700 moving to Albania on Friday and 5,000
expected in Macedonia on Saturday. A large group of refugees came
from Suva Reka, a town northeast of Prizren that formerly had
18,000 residents. Refugees from the town were ``driven from their
homes at gunpoint with half an hour to pack, gathered in the city
center and loaded onto buses,'' Shea said. The refugees were
transported to another town and then walked across the border.
</P>
<P>
   -- Another 2,740 refugees were flown out of Macedonia to various
countries for temporary resettlement. The Macedonian government,
meanwhile, was considering the contruction of two new refugees
camps.
</P>
<P>
   -- Serbian officials denied that its soldiers are deserting,
rebutting US suggestions that morale is low and that forces are in
disarray. The Serbs said that some forces are returning home as
scheduled, not deserting.
</P>
<P>
   -- The KLA's Thaqi, who spent the last two months inside Kosovo,
visited a refugee camp in Albania and was given a hero's welcome by
crowds of displaced residents. ``We are not alone. Albania is
supporting us, the world is supporting us,'' the 29-year-old rebel
leader told the refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Another Kosovo leader, Rexhep Qosja, also appeared at the camps.
Qosja, 62, who heads the United Democratic Movement, urged an end
to the rift between the KLA and another Kosovo leader, Ibrahim
Rugova, whom the KLA considers a pacifist.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO countries, countries that have such different political
attitudes as Greece and Turkey, are agreeing,'' Qosja said. ``It
does not make sense if Albanians do not agree with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Kranish reported from Washington and Cullen from Belgrade.

FINANCIAL ANIMOSITY AMONG OWNERS BREWING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Forbes magazine reported in the May 31 issue that
the Los Angeles Dodgers lost $11.5 million last season. What does
that mean to you?
</P>
<P>
   Will ticket prices rise again? Probably. Will the club attempt
to seek public assistance to help build lucrative luxury boxes so
they can afford another Kevin Brown?
</P>
<P>
   While those would be unpopular moves, how about another work
stoppage in two years when baseball's collective bargaining
agreement is set to expire?
</P>
<P>
   The animosity between management and players isn't an issue,
yet. But owners, whose unity always is a problem in these matters,
already are crumbling. In the last agreement, forged after the 1994
World Series was canceled, wealthy owners were required to pay a
percentage of their revenue to the smaller clubs to promote
competition.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Yankees paid $13 million in revenue sharing. The
lowly Montreal Expos received $13 million. The Reds, Pirates and
A's received more than $6 million and actually turned a profit last
year as a result. The Dodgers paid almost that much and dumped the
salaries of pitchers Dave Mlicki and Mel Rojas to cut payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Don't cry for them. They are not about to throw Eric Young into
the street. The new owners at Fox lost $10 million televising the
World Series and didn't flinch. The O'Malleys lost $35 million over
the previous three years and did not cancel one cocktail party.
Corporations with many entities like Fox can shift around profits
and losses. And besides, business losses can be written off for the
first five years after a company is purchased.
</P>
<P>
   But wealthy clubs are angry because the money they've shelled
out has not been used to bridge the competitive imbalance. Instead
of going after free agents, smaller market club actually have
reduced payroll. They have taken the money to stay afloat, not to
bid for Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the wealthy owners felt strong-armed by the small-market
clubs during the last negotiations. It was one man, one vote _ not
three votes for George Steinbrenner because he has the best cable
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Bud Selig, now full-time commissioner after several years in an
interim role, pleaded that his Milwaukee Brewers could not survive
without assistance. Even with a new ballpark ready to open next
year, there is little chance the Brewers can make up ground.
</P>
<P>
   As always, the credibility of the owners' financial records will
come into question. Forbes put the number of clubs losing money at
14. Selig says it could be as high as 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in each one of our meetings since December 1997 and
there have been significant losses,'' Philadelphia GM Ed Wade said.
``Unless the whole thing is a charade _ and they would do that for
my benefit _ there are a lot of teams in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet every winter, free-agent money continues to pour. Not only
did the Dodgers give Brown $105 million last winter, the St. Louis
Cardinals gave Scott Radinsky $5 million for two years and the New
York Mets gave Dennis Cook $6 million for three. Both are
left-handed setup men, not even closers.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, that was the biggest statement for the health of the
game,'' agent Scott Boras said. ``The stars are going to get their
money, but when teams recognize and compensate the valuable but
lesser-known players like that, the game is in good shape.''
</P>
<P>
   The players are watching from a distance, some closer than
others. If revenue sharing is not expanded as Selig wants, it's
unlikely any of the smaller clubs will be competitive and free
agents will have fewer options.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Phillies, playing in a top-five market, are
complaining. They have attempted fiscal restraint and balk at
Forbes' claim they made $4.5 million last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat in the room in 1994 during the lockout and listened to
the rhetoric,'' Phillies ace Curt Schilling said. ``I have a couple
businesses ... and I do know there are ways to manipulate the
numbers to make them say whatever you'd like. If they want to quell
the problem, open your books.''

YANKEES BEAT WHITE SOX, 10-2  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ Roger Clemens had waited 25 agonizing days for this
day to arrive. While Clemens was on the disabled list, George
Steinbrenner ignored Don Zimmer, Zimmer made incorrect predictions
about Joe Torre's return as manager, Torre surprised everyone when
he rejoined the team last Tuesday and the Red Sox leapt over the
Yankees into first place. Through it all, Clemens was merely
another spectator.
</P>
<P>
   But that changed dramatically Saturday as Clemens returned and
helped the Yankees subdue the White Sox, 10-2, at Comiskey Park in
Game 1 of a doubleheader. The Yankees almost forgot how he looked
in his uniform, but Clemens reminded them and everyone else why he
is so valuable and why he should be able to give this plodding team
a boost.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens recorded his 18th straight winning decision, setting an
American League record, but it was somewhat anticlimactic because
he has had 10 no-decisions during the streak. The Yankees helped
preserve Clemens' streak by rallying after he had been bruised
twice in his first five starts for them. But that was unnecessary
Saturday because the five-time Cy Young award winner allowed one
earned run and six hits over six innings. Andy Pettitte started
against Mike Sirotka in the second game as the Yankees searched for
their third straight victory after enduring a stretch in which they
lost 7 of 8.
</P>
<P>
   Buoyed by Jorge Posada's two-run homer and five runs batted in
and two-run home runs by Tino Martinez and Bernie Williams, Clemens
(3-0) will now pursue the major league record of 24 straight
victories by Carl Hubbell of the New York Giants (1936-37). As
excited as Torre was to see the Yankees hit three homers in a game
for the first time since May 4 and see an offense that had mustered
14 runs in the last 8 games erupt, the most important development
was Clemens' 89-pitch effort. Four days after the Yankees got their
manager back, they got their ace back, and his winning streak
continued.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a Hall of Fame-caliber guy,'' Torre said.
``The whole thing about pitching is anyone can light it up for one
or two starts. To do it over the course of a year, you have to be a
superstar.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens performed like a superstar when Frank Thomas batted with
runners on first and second in the fifth. The Yankees were ahead,
6-2, but Thomas had three homers in 43 at-bats off Clemens so it
was a tense moment. When Thomas hit a grounder to third base,
Clemens began skipping off the mound. He stared as the play
unraveled and pumped his fist when the Yankees turned two to end
the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen years and two days after Clemens won his first major
league game, he won his 236th to tie the Hall of Famer Whitey Ford,
perhaps the best pitcher in Yankees history, for 49th place on the
career list. Clemens last lost on May 29, 1998, to Cleveland, while
he was with Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens was late in finishing his warm-ups. He trotted across
the outfield grass with the Yankees' pitching coach, Mel
Stottlemyre, as Derek Jeter was about to bat in the first inning.
The bizarre scene, coupled with the sparse crowd for the opening
game, gave the sunny afternoon a casual feel. That changed in the
bottom of the first.
</P>
<P>
   When Clemens ambled to the mound for the first time in three and
a half weeks, he was typically fierce. He struck out Chris
Singleton with a 1-2 split-finger fastball and got Mike Caruso to
tap out to third base. But Ray Durham laced a single to right,
Thomas had an infield single when Jeter did not charge a roller to
shortstop, and both advanced on a wild pitch. Clemens figured he
was out of the inning when Magglio Ordonez hit a chopper to third,
but Scott Brosius bounced a throw to first and the White Sox were
ahead, 1-0.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees countered in the second when Posada lined a fastball
off John Snyder over the center-field fence for a two-run homer. It
was Posada's first homer since May 8 and it gave Clemens a 2-1
edge. Posada also slapped a three-run double in the eighth, missing
a grand slam by five feet when the ball caromed off the left-field
fence. The five runs batted in gave Posada half as many r.b.i.
Saturday as the 10 he had managed in his first 88 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox tied it, 2-2, in the third, and the Yankees again
retaliated with power. After Williams walked to open the fourth,
Martinez belted a fastball that sneaked over the right-field fence
for another two-run homer and a 4-2 lead. It was Martinez's first
homer in 17 games. Would it be enough for Clemens to succeed and
remain unbeaten? It definitely was.

BULLS TO HAVE FIRST CHOICE IN MIXED BAG  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SECAUCUS, N.J. _ If winning six National Basketball Association
championships did not prove that Jerry Krause was good, he found
out Saturday that he could be lucky too, earning the No. 1 overall
pick in the coming draft for his Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls had the third-worst record in the NBA this season at
13-37 and therefore the third-most chances in the draft lottery,
after the Vancouver Grizzlies and Los Angeles Clippers. But after
winning the right to select first, Krause, the Bulls' general
manager, will not find a Michael Jordan in the draft. He may not
find a guaranteed impact player at all.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest winners Saturday were the Charlotte Hornets,
who had the fewest chances in the lottery (0.7 percent) but won the
third pick in the draft June 30 in Washington. The Grizzlies drew
the No. 2 pick, and the Clippers fell to the fourth spot.
</P>
<P>
   There is no clear-cut No. 1 pick and maybe not even a tier of
players that general managers and scouts can agree on as the class
of the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a peculiar draft,'' said Marty Blake, the NBA scouting
director. ``There are going to be a lot of guys taken from about 15
to 40 that are going to turn out to be pretty good. This draft has
unusual depth. I'm not saying that they are great, but it's unusual
depth.''
</P>
<P>
   The players expected to go at the top of the draft are mostly
from the crop of underclassmen, including Lamar Odom of Rhode
Island, Corey Maggette and Elton Brand of Duke, Baron Davis of UCLA
and Steve Francis of Maryland. But no one seems sure which of those
players can emerge as an impact player.
</P>
<P>
   Maggette has drawn the most attention for his athletic
abilities, even more so than Brand, the college player of the year.
Maggette has been compared to Jordan, but he played just one year
at Duke and did not even start, which had coaches and family urging
him to return to school.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly Corey Maggette could be one of the top prospects
even though he didn't start for his college team,'' said Stu
Jackson, Vancouver's general manager. ``Most people feel that way
simply because he's got size for his position, 6 foot 6 at the
shooting guard.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, a player whom teams had seen little of early, Michael
Olowokandi, emerged as the first pick. Still, with Maggette not
having an opportunity to show his wares on an extended basis, teams
may turn to one of the other underclassmen.
</P>
<P>
   Experience may not count for much, with the top seniors _ Wally
Szczerbiak of Miami of Ohio, Andre Miller of Utah, Jason Terry of
Arizona and Kenny Thomas of New Mexico _ projected below the top
three spots, lumped in with the likes of Ron Artest of St. John's.
</P>
<P>
   Among the underclassmen, Francis has been compared to Allen
Iverson of the Philadelphia 76ers, while some compare Odom to Magic
Johnson or Scottie Pippen with his size and skills.
</P>
<P>
   The one thing that most scouts and general managers agree on is
that the draft is unusually deep at the point guard position.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could have five point guards in the lottery this year and
five more that could be very good,'' Blake said.

PRESSURE'S OFF, PIAZZA PERFORMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For those of you wishing Mike Piazza was still a
Los Angeles Dodger, the next few months could be painful.
</P>
<P>
   In the first game of Thursday's doubleheader between the New
York Mets and Milwaukee Brewers, Piazza finally had the kind of
night that made him the most feared catcher in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Although Robin Ventura!off hit grand slams in both games of the
Mets' sweep, Piazza's 3-for-5 with three runs and a two-run homer
set the tone.
</P>
<P>
   Until that point, Piazza, who spent two weeks on the disabled
list with a sprained knee, was having a below-average season for
him, and merely average for the rest of the league.
</P>
<P>
   The average among National League catchers was .273 with four
homers and 18 RBI. Before the streak and entering that game, Piazza
was at .273 with four homers and 19 RBI. With his home run Friday,
Piazza had homered in four straight games.
</P>
<P>
   One year after he was traded by the Dodgers to the Marlins and
onto the Mets in a seven-day span, Piazza feels it has all worked
out for the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I have a big job, but I don't feel this team lives and
dies with me the way it was in Los Angeles,'' he said. ``I have a
responsibility, but I don't feel like it is `if I hit we win and if
I don't we lose.'''
</P>
<P>
   Stung in Arizona: The Arizona Diamondbacks spent a day in first
place this past week and outfielder Luis Gonzalez had a 30-game
hitting streak. But not all the news was good.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Stottlemyre will miss 4-6 weeks, possibly the season, after
two MRIs Wednesday disclosed a partially torn right rotator cuff
and a slight tear of the right labrum. He was 4-1, 3.49 in nine
starts after signing a four-year, $32 million free-agent contract
in the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre will try to rehab the injuries without surgery, but
if that does not take, he will face season-ending arthroscopic
surgery. While with the Mets, teammate Armando Reynoso underwent
surgery for similar shoulder injuries on Aug. 18, 1997. He made his
next major-league start on July 24, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a reason: Rod Beck had elbow surgery Saturday to remove
bone chips. Beck, who saved 51 games last year, says his elbow has
bothered him for a few years. He calls the surgery ``a 500-inning
tuneup.''
</P>
<P>
   With Beck absent, the Cubs didn't waste much time in filling the
closer's role. The team traded two minor-leaguers to Minnesota for
Rick Aguilera.
</P>
<P>
   Aguilera, who is earning $3.25 million in the last year of his
contract, is believed to be interested in a contract extension (one
or two years at $3 million a year). Beck is making $5.5 million
this year and will earn $3.5 next year. The Cubs have an option for
2001 at $4.5 with a $500,000 buyout.
</P>
<P>
   Wake-up call: Cincinnati's Jeff Hammonds hit three home runs in
Tuesday's 24-12 victory over the Colorado Rockies at Coors Field.
Entering the game, Hammonds was batting .132 with no homers and
three RBI...
</P>
<P>
   After hitting .273 with 44 doubles, 13 home runs and 73 RBI as a
rookie, Expos first baseman and Montclair Prep grad Brad Fullmer
now finds himself back at Triple-A Ottawa. Fullmer, who was hitting
.209 with 10 RBI in 29 games, had also hit just .197 last
September.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a team where a lot of guys are in the development
stage and there has to be something wrong when you have a worse
year than you had last year,'' manager Felipe Alou said. ``There
are some guys here who would be better off in the minors.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   I was launching a wad of paper at my official Michael Jordan
wastebasket when she strolled into the office.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, she was hotter than Jeff Van Gundy's forehead
when the Knicks trail at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're scoring, the wad of paper fell harmlessly on the
indoor-outdoor carpet. I had been fouled, roughed up, worked over,
given the business.
</P>
<P>
   Glancing at the official Dick Bavetta 24-second clock on the
wall, I knew my best shot had to be forced.
</P>
<P>
   I took it. ``What's a woman like you doin' in a column like
this?''
</P>
<P>
   She smiled and reached into her purse.
</P>
<P>
   I reached for my super-soaker water pistol.
</P>
<P>
   She held up a piece of paper and said this: ``Do you validate
parking?''
</P>
<P>
   I let her have it with the super-soaker, then made the universal

point the way with an unlit Red Auerbach cigar.

   He nodded, then said what he had to say. ``I need free agents.
And don't even bother with Karl Malone and John Stockton.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why, because there's no way they won't be back with Utah?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said, ``because they're dirtier than a truck stop
toilet.''
</P>
<P>
   Had me there. I changed the subject. ``You have cap room?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have cap room.''
</P>
<P>
   That meant he worked for the Clippers, Bulls or Raptors. But
rather than press him for more info, the 911, the scoop, I just
laughed. ``Do you know the free-agent market is as sparse as a
Thanksgiving turkey carcass after a victory lap by Milwaukee Bucks
coach George Karl?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just do it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's in it for me?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clippers tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   I did it anyway. Thanks to the restrictive nature of the new
collective bargaining deal, most of these suspects will stay put.
Here's the best of what's left:
</P>
<P>
   POWER FORWARD
</P>
<P>
   1. Vin Baker (Seattle): Even though he had, for him, a
remarkably rotten season, he should be able to use his opt-out
clause to make the Sonics bleed.
</P>
<P>
   2. Gary Trent (Dallas): He represents the best move Don Nelson's
made since Nellie quit wearing sneakers with suits. The Mavs will
cough up big scoots to keep Trent.
</P>
<P>
   3. Charles Oakley (Toronto): Will make the Raptors pay dearly or
sign with a contender for much less.
</P>
<P>
   POWERLESS (SMALL) FORWARD
</P>
<P>
   1. Cliff Robinson (Phoenix): A 6-foot-11 ``three'' man who can
run, shoot and defend. Pay up, Suns.
</P>
<P>
   2. Corliss Williamson (Sacramento): Signed for only half a mil
so Kings could bring in Vlade Divac. Too bad he played like he was
paid.
</P>
<P>
   3. Detlef Schrempf (Seattle): His status may be affected by that
of volatile teammate Gary Payton.
</P>
<P>
   CENTER
</P>
<P>
   1. Erick Dampier (Golden State): A good shot blocker who truly
would be valuable if he could figure out how to block his own
shots.
</P>
<P>
   2. Olden Polynice (Seattle): Should be known as Lden, because he
has no O.
</P>
<P>
   3. Wilt Chamberlain (Motel 6): It was him or Will Perdue.
</P>
<P>
   SHOOTING GUARD
</P>
<P>
   1. Mitch Richmond (Washington): Sign-and-trade bait. Still would
look great in a Kings uniform.
</P>
<P>
   2. Penny Hardaway (Orlando): Too immature to ride the grown-up
rides at Disney World. Has inspired descendents of Abe Lincoln to
have Abe's mug removed from the one-cent piece.
</P>
<P>
   3. J.R. Rider (Portland): The good news ... hiring a babysitter
does not count against the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   POINT GUARD
</P>
<P>
   1. Terrell Brandon (Minnesota): Even though his agent and
T'wolves personnel boss Kevin McHale were college roomies, Brandon
could move.
</P>
<P>
   2. Nick Van Exel (Denver): Nuggets think the good outweighs the
bad.
</P>
<P>
   3. Eric Snow (Philadelphia): Shame, shame on his agent if this
guy signs with another team.
</P>
<P>
   I submitted my list to the poorly dressed man, then asked him to
reveal the name of his employer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could tell ya,'' he said, ``but then I'd have to make ya
watch the 1999 Chicago Bulls highlight tape.''
</P>
<P>
   That was 30 seconds I just couldn't spare.
</P>
<P>
   WEAKLY DRAFT UPDATE
</P>
<P>
   The list of early entry draft candidates released this week did
not include the name Yao Ming. Ming is the 18-year-old from China,
who checks in at somewhere between 7-3 and 7-5, depending on the
quality of his sweat socks.
</P>
<P>
   The kid reportedly had signed with a Cleveland-based agent who
planned to make Ming available for the '99 draft. But the NBA
invalidated the agreement, so Ming is expected to be represented by
Bill Duffy (he is the agent for Brandon and Michael Olowokandi,
among others) when the draft rolls around next year.
</P>
<P>
   According to rumor, Chinese officials had hoped Ming would play
in L.A., then changed their minds upon realizing the L.A. in
question was not Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   The early entry list did include junior college hotshots
DeeAndre Hulett and Alexsandar Radojevic.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-7 Hulett (College of the Sequoias) is an athletic small
forward with shooting range and enough early hype to interest teams
selecting at the end of round 1 or the top of round 2.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-3 Radojevic (Barton County, Kan.) had signed to play at
Ohio State, but the NCAA put the kibosh on that move after finding
out this poor man's Zydrunas Ilgauskas had been paid to play in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the list includes high schoolers Jonathan Bender
(Picayune, Miss.) and Leon Smith (Chicago). Bender, high-lottery
material, is a 6-11 forward who could be described as an unplugged
version of Kevin Garnett.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, second-round material, is a 6-9 center who played at
Martin Luther King High, and could be described as an unplugged
version of Elmore Smith.
</P>
<P>
   SHOT-CLOCK VIOLATIONS
</P>
<P>
   Rashard Griffith, the ex-Wisconsin bruiser who also played at
Chicago MLK, may return from an extended stay in Europe. The Bucks
still own the rights to the 6-10 Griffith, and just happen to have
an inside game that's weaker than frat-house beer. ... Thanks to
the Stephon Marbury trade, the Timberwolves have New Jersey's high
lottery pick, but prefer trading it for a player who shaves. ...
Shaquille O'Neal's destruction of an Alamodome TV proves he still
can't handle the screen. ... Hey, Dennis Rodman! You know it's time
to chill when you've been served with more suits than you've worn.
... Pacers center Rik Smits is evidence that socks education is not
being taught in Indiana.

TIME OFF ALLOWS RIPKEN TO HEAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ During his record streak for consecutive games,
Cal Ripken rarely seemed anything less than immortal. There were
occasional batting slumps, a few suggestions he should take a day
off. But his consistency made him the most admired player in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   But now that he has returned from his first visit to the
disabled list for severe lower back pain, Ripken admits the time
off was good for him as a person.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did he hit safely in the first six games back, Ripken
said being away from the game helped him grieve the loss of his
father Cal, Sr., who died in late March.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a silver lining to the injury,'' Ripken said. ``It
gave me time to heal mentally and physically. I jumped right back
into baseball because I thought it was the best thing to do after
my dad's funeral. Maybe it was a little too soon. Maybe I should
have taken a little time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ripken also came back with a new batting stance, similar to one
he used in his MVP year of 1991. The result: eight hits in 26
at-bats in the first six games and more than an RBI per game. He
still needs around 110 hits to reach 3,000 and would like to do it
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Indians roll: Just when the Chicago White Sox were feeling good
about their start, they were crushed by the Cleveland Indians this
past week. The Indians completed a three-game sweep by scoring 39
runs (13 in each game) while hitting .414 (48 for 116).
</P>
<P>
   After 39 games, Cleveland is on pace to win 120. During that
span the Indians have scored 290 runs, an average of 7.4 per game.
Ten times they've scored 10 or more runs. The modern-day record for
runs in a season is 1,067 by the 1931 Yankees. Cleveland is on pace
to score 1,199.
</P>
<P>
   See ya, Zim: Although the New York Yankees lost their first two
games after the return of Joe Torre, the club was ready for interim
manager Don Zimmer to return to his duties as dugout coach. One
veteran player said having the 68-year-old Zimmer as their leader
for two months was ``like a grandfather watching the kids for too
long.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmer's reign probably reached its end when he crashed a
players-only meeting after a 1-0 loss to the Angels at Yankee
Stadium. Although Zimmer was generally well-liked by the players,
he also had gotten on the bad side of owner George Steinbrenner,
who suggested he take the job when Torre was diagnosed with
prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Hot and cold: After hitting two home runs in his first 119
at-bats this season, Seattle DH Edgar Martinez hit five in the span
of eight at-bats. One of them was hit to left field, two were to
center field and two to right field.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's mini-hitting streak is at four games, and for each of
them he has had his arthritic left thumb heavily taped, then hidden
beneath thick black batting gloves....
</P>
<P>
   Oakland's Ben Grieve grounded out as a pinch-hitter Wednesday,
dropping his average to .131. Two hits off K.C.'s Jeff Suppan on
Thursday raised it only to .144.
</P>
<P>
   At the season's quarter-pole, many in the A's clubhouse are
wondering how much longer manager Art Howe can go with the 1998 AL
Rookie of the Year.

RELIGIOUS SHAS PARTY: ONE OF ISRAELI ELECTION'S BIG WINNERS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Down the streets of the insular world of Israel's
ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods, men in traditional black coats
and wide-brimmed hats glare with suspicion at outsiders. Young boys
and girls stare blankly before their mothers herd them inside their
homes, away from the strangers.
</P>
<P>
   They are known as the ``haredim,'' or ``God fearing.''
</P>
<P>
   But after capturing many more seats in parliament in Monday's
general election, the haredim are the ones instilling fear in many
Israelis. Especially the majority who want Israel to be first and
foremost a secular democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak, who was handed a landslide
victory, begins to form his government &UR;  &LR; Sunday. And Barak may
consider inviting the ultra-Orthodox party Shas, or perhaps one of
the other religious parties, into his Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   Many political analysts say that if Barak invites the
ultra-Orthodox in, he runs the risk of alienating the secular left
wing that worked hard to get him elected. Other observers say the
power of the ultra-Orthodox, and particularly Shas, has become so
overwhelming it can't be ignored if Barak wants to effectively
govern.
</P>
<P>
   Shas, a ``haredi'' movement that represents mostly first- and
second-generation immigrants from North Africa and the greater
Middle East, captured 17 seats in Israel's 120-member parliament.
By picking up seven seats, Shas, a Hebrew acronym for Sephardic
Guardians of the Torah, consolidated its place as the third-largest
party in Israel and reached a political parity with the
conservative Likud Party, which plunged to only 19 seats from the
32 it had before the elections.
</P>
<P>
   The secular left parties also scored big victories and many
secular voters, even those from the political right, said they
voted for Barak's left-of-center One Israel list because they
thought it would contain ultra-Orthodox influence in politics. So
the results of the election revealed a deepening of the
religious-secular divide.
</P>
<P>
   Religious law
</P>
<P>
   The political haredim are Jewish fundamentalists who
overwhelmingly support the implementation of ``halacha,'' or Jewish
religious law.
</P>
<P>
   The growing power of the haredim has also made many American
Jews, whether secular, Conservative, or Reform, uneasy about the
direction they think the haredim are trying to take a nation to
which they have strong ties.
</P>
<P>
   Since Zionism began a century ago, the underlying question has
been whether a Jewish state would define itself as a democracy or a
theocracy. The rise of the haredim has given the question new
urgency.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Rosenblum, 43, a Yale Law School graduate who grew up
in a traditional Jewish home in suburban Chicago, is a member of
the haredim and writes a column for the Jerusalem Post.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shas is a reflection of traditional Jews returning to a more
intense religious experience,'' he said. ``There is a fear among
seculars, a terror of the haredim that vastly exaggerates our
political influence. It is a form of bigotry, plain and simple.''
</P>
<P>
   High birthrate
</P>
<P>
   The fear is brought on by a sense that Israel, especially
Jerusalem, has become overrun by the ultra-Orthodox. The haredim
have an average of seven children per family. More than 50 percent
of children in Jerusalem, and about 25 percent across Israel,
attend haredi schools.
</P>
<P>
   The community is a significant drain on the Israeli economy. The
unemployment rate among Haredi men is an estimated 60 percent
because so many are enrolled in yeshivas, or religious seminaries.
The number of yeshiva students has surged from 35,000 in 1990 to
almost 80,000 Sunday, and the black-clad ultra-Orthodox young men
leafing through Talmudic texts and praying in a rhythmic
back-and-forth movement seem ubiquitous in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The army of yeshiva students has given Israel a higher rate of
nonparticipation in the adult male workforce than any other country
in the developed world, according to one study. They receive
welfare, tax exemptions, national insurance, and stipends for books
and are given a blanket draft deferment while they study. This has
caused seething resentment in a nation where the economy is
faltering and where a selfless devotion to mandatory military
service is a point of pride. One of Barak's most resonant campaign
themes was to put an end to the blanket deferments and force the
students to carry out some form of national service.
</P>
<P>
   Political power
</P>
<P>
   The Jerusalem neighborhood of Har Nof is a manifestation of the
religious zeal, the factionalism, the mysticism, and the raw
political power of the ultra-Orthodox community. A swath of modern
symmetrical apartment buildings built of white stone, the community
overlooks the sprawling, ancient Jewish cemeteries on the Mount of
Olives outside the Old City.
</P>
<P>
   Here lives the spiritual leader of Shas, Rabbi Ovadia Yosef, as
does Aryeh Deri, who stepped down as the group's political leader
after the election. Deri can be compared to America's populist,
immigrant political bosses _ playing off ethnic resentment,
religious affiliation, and the suffering of the underclass, in this
case to gain influence for the Jewish migrants from North Africa
and the Arab world known as the Sephardim.
</P>
<P>
   In Benjamin Netanyahu's outgoing governing coalition, Deri was
particularly skillfull at channeling funding to Sephardic housing,
to educational institutions and health care clinics in
disenfranchised Sephardic neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   And like many old school political bosses, Deri has run into
trouble with the law. Deri was convicted of corruption, bribery,
and fraud and sentenced last month to four years in prison. He is
awaiting appeal, but has lashed out at Israel's judicial system,
saying it is controlled by the secular, Ashkenazi elite of European
Jews, who want to keep him from empowering the Sephardim.
</P>
<P>
   On land issues, the ultra-Orthodox, especially Shas, are more
pliable than the ultranationalists, who are also religious. But the
ultra-Orthodox are just as rigid on social issues.
</P>
<P>
   Arazi Cohen, 39, of Moroccan ancestry, a Yeshiva student, was
carrying thick, leather-bound volumes of Talmudic interpretations
under his arm, excited about the success of Shas in the recent
election.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big part of this nation wants Judaism, more Jewish life.
This country should be established with religious laws,'' said
Cohen, reflecting the messianic fervor among the ultra-Orthodox who
believe Israel is destined to become a theocratic state.
</P>
<P>
   Culture war
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the religious-secular divide in Israel is a
culture war between Jerusalem, where the haredi are thriving, and
Tel Aviv, the heart of Israel's secular culture.
</P>
<P>
   Haredim are casually referred to by secular Israelis as ``the
blacks,'' a comment on the color of the men's clothing, but many
religious people believe it is said with derision and an underlying
bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   But the haredim, too, have a lexicon of hatred, referring to the
nonreligious as ``the Messiah's donkeys.''
</P>
<P>
   Sefi Rachlevski, author of a nonfiction book titled ``Messiah's
Donkey,'' said, ``More and more secular Israelis feel they are
losing the identity of Israel. They feel they have become donkeys
for a dream of the messianic ultra-Orthodox, and for the settler
movement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In this election,'' Rachlevski said, ``the donkeys said,
`Enough is enough.' ''

DEFIANCE GIVES WAY TO GRIM RESIGNATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE _ A few days ago, the outdoor cafes in the Skadarlija
section of the Yugoslav capital were teeming with patrons, as
Belgrade residents sipped beer and soaked up the late afternoon
sun.
</P>
<P>
   Without warning, there was a huge explosion nearby, a thud that
jerked conversation to a sudden halt. But only briefly. People
paused for a few seconds, looked at each other, then turned back to
their conversations. In the beer garden of the BiP brewery, none of
the two dozen patrons got up to leave.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO's air campaign enters its third month, the constant
bombardment of this capital has left its 2 million residents more
than war-weary. They are literally weary. Sleep deprivation is one
of the biggest byproducts of the bombing of Belgrade. Virtually
everyone complains of not having slept soundly since the bombing
began March 24.
</P>
<P>
   The exuberant defiance shown in outdoor rallies in the early
days of the bombing has been replaced by something more like groggy
resignation that the war, and the widespread inconvenience and
occasional violent death that goes along with it, will continue
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   There is a certain routine and normality to the days, while
nights are almost always accompanied by wailing air raid sirens,
the hum of NATO warplanes overhead, and the booms of missiles,
striking in and around the city.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from some isolated staples, such as sugar and cooking oil,
there are no obvious food shortages. Buses and trolleys run, and
they are always full, though more than half of the population is
out of work. People wait in line for hours to buy cigarettes, while
impatient or desperate smokers pay double or triple prices on the
black market. Gas is being rationed, but plenty is available on the
black market for those willing to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the people of Sarajevo, who lost their electricity and
water for years, people in Belgrade so far have not had to put up
with the sort of maddening inconvenience that others in the Balkans
have had to endure for parts of the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   There is an unsettling unpredictability about the war. After
nearly two weeks of relative calm that followed NATO's mistaken
bombing of the Chinese Embassy, nightly bombing resumed last
Tuesday, and some of the heaviest bombing of the last two months
occurred Wednesday night into Thursday morning. Saturday, NATO said
it had flown the most sorties in any 24-hour period, and vowed to
increase them.
</P>
<P>
   Few people here now believe it's going to get better before it
gets worse. There were widespread blackouts Saturday. The
inconvenience factor may be about to be racheted up considerably.
</P>
<P>
   Residents say the bomb shelters are less crowded these days than
when the bombing first began _ not because there is any less
bombing, but because more people have decided to take their chances
in the comfort of their own homes.
</P>
<P>
   Vera Balabanic does a mean impression of a cruise missile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weeeee-oooooooo, boom!'' says the 73-year-old woman. She says
her nerves are shot, that she fears that the missiles that struck
the police building just a block from her home will one day come
through her wall. That isn't enough to get her to leave her
9th-floor apartment for the bomb shelter in her basement. After a
few sleepless nights in the basement, she swore off shelters.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Veljko, also 73, agrees, saying he would rather die
in his bed than endure the claustrophobic cacophony of the shelter.
For him, suffering is relative. As a 17-year-old partisan, he was
captured and held in a concentration camp for nearly two years by
the Nazis' Croatian collaborators.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the fear is bigger than the rational thinking, then you go
to the bomb shelter,'' he explains, sitting in his living room,
strains of Marvin Gaye's ``What's Going On'' coming from the
stereo. ``Right now, rationally, I don't want to go to the bomb
shelter.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Balabanics, like tens of thousands of Belgrade residents,
take the odds that their homes won't be hit by stray NATO missiles.
The strategy is not without risk. Every one here mentions a
3-year-old girl killed in one of the early raids. On Thursday, a
missile fell 500 yards short of its target, a military complex,
flattening a hospital neurological unit and killing at least four
people.
</P>
<P>
   But if staying in one's apartment is better than trying to get a
night's sleep in a bomb shelter, it is only marginally better.
Sladana Topalovic, a dentist, said she has never felt more tired in
her life. She said that when she gets up in the morning she feels
as if she has closed her eyes but not slept.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody feels like this, it's not just me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   If Belgrade residents think they have it bad, there are some who
believe they don't have it bad enough. Some NATO commanders want to
cut off electricity and water, in hopes of stirring resistance to
President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Still, few people here expect a public uprising, or for
Milosevic to sacrifice himself for a settlement. As NATO turns the
screws, ordinary people voice anger at NATO, not Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But judging dissent here is difficult. Police, many of them in
plainclothes, are everywhere. After opposition party leaders
suggested Milosevic cut a deal with NATO, their offices were
vandalized by mobs as police looked on.
</P>
<P>
   Like many who have relatives in the countryside, Joca Dokoc sent
his wife and 7-year-old son to a rural area last month. Without
telling him in advance, they returned on Wednesday, just in time
for the heaviest bombing, including the first bombs that fell in
their neighborhood, aimed at nearby fuel tanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son is very frightened,'' says Dokoc. ``He said, `Can I
sleep in your bed?' I said, `OK for tonight. Tomorrow, you go back
to the country.' ''

MODEL CITIZEN OR NOT, SPREWELL IS A PLAYER (For use by NYTimes News

<TEXT>
<P>
   Like it or not, Latrell Sprewell is back.
</P>
<P>
   As an impact player. As a model citizen. As the American dream?
</P>
<P>
   ``People say I'm what's wrong with sports today,'' Sprewell says
in his new TV ad for And-1 shoes while Jimi Hendrix' Woodstock
rendition of the national anthem plays. ``I say I'm the American

</P>
<P>
   While the NBA league office and Warriors coach P.J. Carlesimo
cringe, Sprewell has single-handedly grabbed the Hawks by the

full-court athleticism and an aggressive offensive attitude lacking
in New York this decade.

   ``He just finds ways to score,'' teammate Chris Childs said. ``I
don't know if there's a better improviser in the league. He can
finish in transition, and when things break down for us, he can
always create a good look for himself.''
</P>
<P>
   While critics complain about a postseason littered with
predictable low-post offenses and double-down defenses, Sprewell
should be a breath of fresh air. Unlike the regular season, he has
stopped laughing on the bus after losses, stopped suing the NBA for
his one-year suspension and even put on hold an appeal of a $25,000
fine from the Knicks for his agent's criticism of him not starting
in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time to play basketball and nothing else,'' Sprewell
said. ``I'm having fun.''
</P>
<P>
   So are the Knicks, 4-1 on the road in the playoffs after going
8-17 during the season. So are the fans, evidenced by No. 1 Knick
fan Spike Lee showing up wearing Sprewell's No. 8 jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Just leaves you wondering, given Sprewell's physical gifts, if
he wouldn't have made a difference in all those New York losses to
Jordan and the Bulls? PACERS-SIXERS
</P>
<P>
   Allen Iverson has taken 83 shots to score his 86 points in the
first three games. ``As good as Allen is, I don't think you can
compare him to Michael Jordan,'' Pacers coach Larry Bird said.
``When Michael scored 30 or 40 on you you'd usually get beat.'' ...
As it has been all season Indiana's bench has been the difference,
outscoring the 76ers by an average of 24-9. LAKERS-SPURS
</P>
<P>
   Call it on-the-job-training: Lakers coach Kurt Rambis thought he
made it clear that he wanted a double-team on Tim Duncan and that
his team had a foul to give. He thought that until he watched
Duncan make a game-winning 8-foot jump hook over J.R. Reid's single
coverage. ... After his dismal Game 1 performance, Shaquille O'Neal
punched a VCR/TV set in the Alamodome locker room costing around
$500. ... Will Perdue could go scoreless and be San Antonio's MVP
of the series for his banging of O'Neal. ``I just try to make his
3-foot hook a 4-foot hook,'' Perdue said. ``With him, it makes a
difference.'' JAZZ-BLAZERS
</P>
<P>
   Hard to imagine a team playing better defense than Portland
during Saturday's 19-0 run in which the Blazers held the Jazz and
its pet pick-and-roll without a basket for more than 10 minutes.
... NBA's most underrated player: Blazers power forward Brian
Grant. Most overrated: Damon Stoudamire, who isn't even the best
point guard on his team (Greg Anthony). ... Jazz coach Jerry Sloan
hates to double-team, but he paid Grant the ultimate compliment by
having John Stockton double him any time Grant dribbled in Game 3.
NUMBERS GAME
</P>
<P>
   6-0: The Pacers' record in the playoffs. The past four teams to
start 6-0 won the title. BAD LOOKS
</P>
<P>
   Worst look: Just when you thought nothing could be worse than
Rik Smits' shaved head last season, he breaks out ridiculous
knee-high black socks.
</P>
<P>
   Worst hair: Portland's Brian Grant has too much, and his coach,
Mike Dunleavy, has too little. 24 SECONDS
</P>
<P>
   One term rarely heard during the exciting, if not artistic
playoffs: lockout. ... Ugliest sight of the postseason: Bloated
Bulls general manager Jerry Krause gloating over winning Saturday's
lottery. ... Don't bet on Charles Barkley retiring, though money
won't be his motivation to return. ``I got $30 million in the
bank,'' Barkley said. ``If I spend all that, I deserve to be broke.
I'd just be leaving more to my freeloading relatives to fight over
when I die.'' ... Also don't be shocked if Penny Hardaway isn't
back in Orlando next season. ``I think he's sending some pretty
strong signals that he'd like to be somewhere else. If that's the
case, we'll help him do that,'' Magic owner Rich DeVos said. ``I
don't think he performed at the level he wanted to be at, and it
was frustrating for him. But it just seems like we can't please
him.'' ... One last wager: The Heat will stay intact despite its
second consecutive upset loss to New York. ``One bounce of the
ball, with eight-tenths of a second left in the game, is not going
to deter me from staying with these guys,'' Miami coach Pat Riley
said. ``Heads are not rolling, unless it's mine.'' nn

WHILE PLAYOFFS RAGE, IDLE TEAMS PLAYING GAMES OF THEIR OWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ We're down to the Elite Eight, NBA style, which
means two things.
</P>
<P>
   You can no longer avoid play-by-play from Bob Costas, who at
least has been deprived this season of moaning his trademark
``Michael!'' in sycophantic tribute to Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   It also means 21 other teams no longer have anything to do.
Well, that isn't completely true. The good organizations are
eagerly awaiting the draft, free agency and trading periods.
</P>
<P>
   So let's take a scan around the league to see what the have-nots
are thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Boston: Rick Pitino wants to gut the roster, which is good,
because the Celtic players have had it with the Slick Rick routine,
especially former Kentucky stars Antoine Walker and Ron Mercer.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte: Looking to dump troublemaker Anthony Mason before he
gets Elden Campbell back to his sulking self. On the other hand,
desperate to re-sign Eddie Jones, a free agent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago: Tim Floyd was a miracle-worker this season, so that may
be why the Bulls are prepared to make an offer to everybody's least
favorite player, Orlando's Penny Hardaway.
</P>
<P>
   Clippers: There is lots of buzz that they are keenly interested
in trading their draft pick. They always get plenty of offers.
They'll take one if owner Donald T. Sterling and VP's Andy Roeser
and Elgin Baylor agree on something. Oh, Chris Ford's opinion
counts too.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland: Here's the Cavs' offseason wish list: 1.Obtain Wally
Szczerbiak. 2. Keep Mike Fratello. 3.Extend contracts of Brevin
Knight and Derek Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas: Mavs fans are bracing themselves for Don Nelson's next
disastrous move. They have offered Robert Pack to Charlotte for
Anthony Mason. Hmmm, not so disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   Denver: Nick Van Exel will be brought back, but the Nuggets'
prized possession this offseason is Phil Jackson. Good luck, guys.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit: Team already has given ultimatum to Bison Dele.
Management is in a quandary over how to secure talent to keep Grant
Hill from bolting when his contract is up.
</P>
<P>
   Golden State: Say adios to Tony Delk, Duane Ferrell, Muggsy
Bogues, Felton Spencer and possibly Erick Dampier as the Warriors
try to remold their bench.
</P>
<P>
   Houston: No cap room because of bloated payroll, and trades are
unlikely. Rudy T.'s challenge is to introduce offense to Scottie
Pippen.
</P>
<P>
   Miami: As usual, Pat Riley has lots of ideas on how Heat got
knocked off (none involving himself). So that means some roster
purging, starting with Dan Majerle and P.J. Brown, and a longshot
stab at Gary Payton.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee: George Karl wants a big man and wants to make a run
at Lorenzen Wright and Vin Baker. He also wants to trade Chris
Gatling and Ervin Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota: How to sign Joe Smith? He's this year's Gugliotta for
the T'Wolves. Terrell Brandon wants to play elsewhere, but has
graciously agreed to a sign-and-trade deal.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey: They want to bring back Don Casey _ unless Phil
Jackson is dumb enough to take the job. Then they need to figure
out how to get Jayson Williams' broken leg to heal in time for next
season.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando: Remember when they were worried Hardaway might not be
back? Today, Chuck Daly's practically buying him a one-way ticket
out of Disney World.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix: The Suns are trying to re-sign Cliff Robinson but the
hot news is that Tom Gugliotta might be sent off. How 'bout to the
Lakers for Glen Rice?
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento: The Kings will be happy to make some minor
adjustments and let Rick Adelman have a full training camp. By
then, he might not be drawing heat for keeping Jason Williams on
the bench in the fourth quarter of Game 5 against Utah.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle: Local institution Detlef Schrempf wants out and Hersey
Hawkins is on the block. Don't expect Don MacLean back either. The
problem is what to do about Payton, with rumors flying that Miami
wants to make a deal.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto: The Raptors want to re-sign Charles Oakley but are
sending out feelers to anyone who wants Doug Christie. They are
also looking to deal one of their lottery picks.
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver: As of today, the Grizzlies are torn between trading
their pick or drafting Lamar Odom. The dilemma is they need
experience to blend with youngsters Mike Bibby, Shareef-Abdur Rahim
and Big Country Reeves.
</P>
<P>
   Washington: Hey, hiring a coach would be nice. Darrell Walker
and John Lucas are the latest candidates. Then they need to figure
out how to keep Mitch Richmond, who wants to leave.
</P>

LIEBERTHAL IS A CATCHER ON THE RISE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Hanging out by the pool did not sound like a fun
offseason for Mike Lieberthal.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies starting catcher missed the final 2{ months of the
season with a stress fracture to his pelvis, suffered during an
early June collision with Toronto's Carlos Delgado at home plate.
He couldn't squat, couldn't run. All he could do was swim.
</P>
<P>
   Before he could resume his career as one of the National
League's most promising catchers, Lieberthal, 27, spent the winter
at his home in Thousand Oaks, swimming and running in neck-deep
water, drills designed to build strength in the pelvic area without
applying much weight.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors said the injury would take six months to heal.
Eleven months later, he is on a tear, batting .351, including eight
homers and 20 RBI in his past 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, he hit two homers, including a grand slam, and
drove in six runs against the Montreal Expos. In Saturday's 9-3
victory over the Mets, Lieberthal hit a three-run home run and
finished with four RBI. He is batting .361 with runners in scoring
position and has just one error in 38 games behind the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was going to take patience,'' he said, ``and so far
the patience has paid off.''
</P>
<P>
   Diligence might be a better word, a word Phillies manager Terry
Francona uses to describe Lieberthal's approach throughout his
professional career.
</P>
<P>
   _Although he was just 150 pounds as a senior at Westlake High,
Lieberthal was selected third overall in the 1990 draft. He was a
controversial pick, taken ahead of future big-league stars Alex
Fernandez and Mike Mussina by the pitching-starved Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   _Lieberthal also was groomed to replace popular and gritty
Darren Daulton on a team that began to stumble badly after reaching
the World Series in 1993. He was chastised by the Phillies pitching
staff, especially ace Curt Schilling, for his work behind the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   _And after reaching career highs with 20 homers and 77 RBI in
his first full season (1997) Lieberthal was grounded by the injury
to his pelvis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has had a lot to work through, but I think his success is
testimony to the kind of person he is,'' Francona said. ``Guys here
say he is a laid-back California kid and he is. But he burns to
succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his gaudy statistics, Lieberthal's greatest contribution
to the Phillies' strong start is his improved relationship with the
pitchers. After four years, his signal calling is now deeply
respected.
</P>
<P>
   So much so that when Schilling struck out 319 batters in 1997,
he gave Lieberthal a Rolex watch ``for making it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As well as Mike hits and throws, the success of this team
depends on how he develops the pitching staff,'' Francona said.
``If we are to move forward we need that relationship to be strong.
You can't have a veteran catcher he has been around awhile. And he
was replacing Daulton. But look at the way he handles them now. I
think that is why we have gotten off to a better start.''
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies are 22-19, just one game behind the second-place
Mets in the National League East. Lieberthal is cautious about his
early numbers and tapered his enthusiasm about last Wednesday's
home-run binge. He has never hit above .256 in the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost the game so it was not as much fun as it could have
been,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberthal knows he won't receive much All-Star ballot support.
He has outplayed Mike Piazza during the first seven weeks of the
season, but Piazza had homered in four consecutive games entering
Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   After going 3 for 4 with two home runs and six RBI on Wednesday
night in Montreal, Lieberthal was hitting .352 with eight homers
and a team-high 27 RBI after 39 games. He also is far superior to
Piazza defensively, and has six more RBI than the Mets catcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so early,'' Lieberthal said when asked about All-Star
consideration. ``I really don't think about it, because I feel like
Piazza and (Jason) Kendall are going to be the two catchers who
make it. But if they want to carry a third catcher and I still have
these stats halfway through, it's something I've always wanted.''

PHILLIES BEAT METS, 9-3  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Benny Agbayani's storybook stretch appeared to come
crashing to an end Saturday, like the coach turning into a pumpkin
at the stroke of midnight, even though it was only about a quarter
to three in the afternoon at Shea Stadium. Agbayani, the Mets'
rookie surprise, was carted away on a motorized cart after sliding
into the right-field retaining wall and smashing his left knee on
its concrete base.
</P>
<P>
   With the Mets down by 5-0 in the third inning of a game they
would lose to the Philadelphia Phillies, 9-3, Agbayani chased after
a foul ball and ran out of room. After he crashed into the wall, he
could not get up on his own, and he and most of the 34,575 fans
feared the worst for a player who had 13 hits in his last 18
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   When X-rays revealed that he had only a bruised left kneecap,
Agbayani and his teammates felt a sense of relief. That feeling was
short-lived, because Bobby Jones _ who, like Agbayani, did not make
it through the third inning _ later said that his pitching shoulder
has been aching for the last few days.
</P>
<P>
   Jones (3-3), who allowed five runs and six hits in two and
two-thirds innings in losing his third straight game, likened the
feeling to a dead-arm period.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was hoping that it was nothing more than a case of
tendinitis, but Saturday he had no life on his fastball, which he
does not throw all that hard even when he is totally healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not throwing that well, obviously,'' Mets Manager Bobby
Valentine said. ``He's missing his spots and not changing his
speeds.''
</P>
<P>
   Other than Masato Yoshii, and excluding the last outings by Rick
Reed and Orel Hershiser, none of the Mets' starters is throwing
well right now. To make matters worse for the Mets, Sunday Reed
will face Curt Schilling, the Philadelphia ace. If the Mets lose,
they will finish this homestand with a 3-4 record, even though they
have scored 41 runs in their last six games.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies (22-19), behind Paul Byrd, pulled within a game of
the Mets (24-19) for second place in the National League East. Byrd
(6-2) allowed three runs and six hits in seven and two-thirds
innings to pick up his second victory over the Mets in six days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I'm trying to show anyone they made a mistake,''
said Byrd, who was cast off as a reliever by both the Mets and the
first-place Atlanta Braves. ``I'm just trying to do well. Over
there I was a mop-up man, and in Atlanta, too. When you're in that
situation, you always feel like someone's letting you be on the
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Byrd did not allow a run until the sixth. By that time the
Phillies had a 6-0 lead, and the right-hander had kept the Mets at
bay with a steady diet of changeups. He retired Mike Piazza three
times with runners in scoring position. Rickey Henderson returned
to the lineup Saturday after a stint on the disabled list with a
right knee sprain, and was 0 for 4.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd even helped his own cause by singling in the Phillies'
second run in a four-run second inning that began with Jones
recording two outs on seven pitches.
</P>
<P>
   It took Jones 32 more pitches to record the third out, however,
as Mike Lieberthal and Desi Relaford hit consecutive triples, Byrd
flared a broken-bat single to left on a 1-2 curveball, Doug
Glanville walked and Marlon Anderson doubled to right. Scott Rolen
grounded to second to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   It has already been like three seasons in one for Jones. In his
first three starts of the year, Jones allowed 3 earned runs in 21
innings (an earned run average of 1.29) and picked up three
victories. In his next three starts, Jones allowed 11 earned runs
in 18 innings (an e.r.a. of 5.50) and did not get a decision. In
his last three starts, Jones has been shellacked for 20 earned runs
in 132/3 innings (an e.r.a. of 13.17) and lost all three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think location is everything,'' Jones said. ``In order for
me to be on, I have to hit my spots consistently, because I don't
have the out pitch. I have to put the ball where I want to eight,
nine times out of 10. When I miss a little, it means a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones is not the only one in pain. Al Leiter has felt soreness
in his left bicep, and Valentine said Allen Watson will start
Monday in Pittsburgh to give his other starters some added rest.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshii figures to start Tuesday to give Leiter more rest, but
Valentine said he wants to wait before he announces how the rest of
his rotation will sort out.
</P>
<P>
   And that is not only because his starters are sore. They are
struggling, particularly Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``He goes up and down a lot,'' Valentine said of Jones. ``But
there is hardly anybody who goes out there and maintains it for 33
starts.''

CLIPPERS DRAW NO. 4 IN DRAFT LOTTERY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Chris Ford, whose team (finally) had put him in a
swell position to win, had a front-row seat when Saturday's NBA
Draft lottery loss applied the frosting to his first Los Angeles
Clippers season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, we would have liked to have done a little better,'' Ford
said after his Clippers, whose 9-41 record gave this franchise the
second-best chance to nab the first pick, were ping-ponged into the
fourth spot for this year's first round. Among the 13 lottery
teams, the Clipper's two-spot tumble was the furthest.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Bulls, who earned the third-best chance by putting
the ``nasty'' in dynasty, rallied to finish first. The Charlotte
Hornets, who arrived with the slimmest chance at victory, left with
the third pick.
</P>
<P>
   However, identifying the true winners and losers is impure
speculation; this season's projected Rookie of the Year, Vince
Carter of the Toronto Raptors, was the fifth player drafted last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's a definitive No.1 pick,'' Ford said on a
conference call after representing the Clippers for the benefit of
NBC cameras. ``The most important thing is to see these guys up
close.''
</P>
<P>
   The potential lottery list that includes 6-foot-9 Rhode Island
swingman Lamar Odom, Maryland combo guard Steve Francis, UCLA point
guard Baron Davis, Connecticut shooting guard Richard Hamilton and
young Corey Maggette, a gymnast disguised as a forward during his
one season at Duke.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers plan to haul several players into L.A. for private
auditions, although their fall to fourth may cross them off the
travel itinerary written by agents of the hottest prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``At four, some players won't even come work out for you,'' Ford
said.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating his predicament is the franchise's evolving
battle plan for the eight free agents who wore the Clippers colors
in 1999. The personnel needs of any team can be twisted with one
swipe of a pen. But, as dictated by the NBA, free agents can't be
signed until Aug. 1. The draft will be held June 30.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to look at each and every position,'' Ford said of the
draft candidates. ``We have to make sure we cover our bases. When
you have eight free agents, anything can happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the draft is the first priority. We have to be happy with
who we select.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers, who picked first after achieving the league's
third-worst record last season, remain pleased with center Michael
Olowokandi, the player selected with the top choice in '98. And
they are thrilled with the progress of power forward Maurice
Taylor, their first-round pick (14th overall) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Adding another hot prospect to this promising nucleus seems
crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult to pinpoint one exact need,'' Ford said, ``but
we definitely want players who are going to compete on a nightly
basis. We want guys who want to be here.''

   LOS ANGELES: the illumination technology industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the scenarios the company is exploring: using a network of
fiber-optic lines from a single light source to provide overhead
illumination along aisles and for each seat in an airplane,
replacing scores of individual light bulbs; replacing neon signs
with cheaper fiber-optic lines that can change colors easily
through the use of filters; using fiber-optic lines as an
alternative to a car's conventional headlights and interior
lighting.
</P>
<P>
   Brenner started Cogent Light as a spinoff of LaserMedia, a Los
Angeles-area company that provided laser light systems for
entertainment attractions.
</P>
<P>
   While developing an alternative to lasers for the company,
Brenner said he discovered a more efficient method for coupling
light into a single fiber.
</P>
<P>
   But the company was no ordinary start-up. It had initial backing
from LaserMedia, and in late 1993, billionaire John Kluge bought a
controlling interest in the company.
</P>
<P>
   The company is already on the fast track for growth. Its sales
doubled between 1997 and 1998, Brenner said, adding that its
current corporate objective is to double sales every year.
</P>
<P>
   That shouldn't be too hard, Brenner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did the hard work over the past 4{ years,'' he said. ``Now

COGENT LIGHT TECHNOLOGIES FIND SUCCESS REFINING FIBER OPTICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON TAKENOUCHI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the world of high-tech lighting, success is
measured in fibers. And for Cogent Light Technologies Inc., based
in Valencia north of Los Angeles, it's measured in single fibers.
</P>
<P>
   The 9-year-old company has made a name for itself with surgical
illumination devices that push high-intensity light through single
fiber-optic strands as small as 0.5 mm wide. The strands replace
commonly used 5 mm bundles and are small enough for medical
operations in tiny spaces and for lightweight surgeon's headlights.
</P>
<P>
   But company officials say the inventions that have made Cogent
Light a top name in the medical lighting field are just a prelude.
In the next 12 months, they say, the private firm plans to begin
its expansion into an array of new markets.
</P>
<P>
   President and founder Douglas Brenner compared the company's
refinement of plastic, single-fiber-optic lighting to the invention
of the light bulb. He said he envisions a future where networks of
fiber-optic lines will illuminate everything from cars to display
cases to airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipate thousands of light sources for commercial
applications,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And illumination is just the start. Brenner said other
possibilities include the replacement of lasers for cutting, a
low-cost heat source and a way to stop bleeding in dental
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   While the leap to new fields may seem a stretch for a company
whose current claims to fame include tools that can assist an
unglamorous endoscopic bowel resection, Brenner has reason to set
the company's goals high.
</P>
<P>
   Cogent Light headlights for surgeons are sold through several
top medical distributors, including Smith and Nephew Inc., and have
become popular with surgeons across the globe. Powered by strong
headlight sales, the company is now among the top manufacturers of
lighting devices that use xenon, a source that gives off white
light similar to sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   The company's rapid rise has been fueled by two innovations.
</P>
<P>
   Most fiber-optic lighting devices use thick bundles of strands,
and those strands usually are made of quartz to prevent melting
during high-energy transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   Cogent Light broke both conventions. Its single-strand
fiber-optic lines can be made smaller than 1 mm wide, and a special
device filters out most of the infrared light that otherwise would
melt plastic.
</P>
<P>
   Since it is a single strand, light from the devices does not
have the dark spots that occur when strands in a fiber-optic bundle
fracture or break. And light emanating from the strands loses
little of its power over long distances.
</P>
<P>
   The result, officials say, is cheaper, lighter and more durable
fiber-optic devices.
</P>
<P>
   Hillel Laks, chief of cardiac surgery at UCLA Medical Center,
said the company's headlights are assets in the operating room
because of their compact weight and size. Older models often weigh
as much as a pound more than comparable Cogent Light lights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their headlight is quite a big advance over the previously
used headlights,'' Laks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're doing long operations or multiple operations, it
makes a big difference to the surgeon,'' he said. ``If it's better
for the surgeon, that translates into being better for the
patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Cogent Light technology has been particularly helpful in some
medical arenas because it allows lighting sources to be far from
where light is needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our environment, there's a strong magnetic field which does
not allow us to put instruments in the room,'' said Daniel Kacher,
senior clinical engineer for the MRI Department of Brigham Women's
Hospital in Boston. ``All the other products use bundles, which
would mean you would have to put the device inside the room.''
</P>
<P>
   While particularly suited for medical lighting, especially
neurosurgery and plastic surgery, the company's patented medical
devices are just a prelude, said company General Manager Dennis
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``For 10 years, we've been developing the technology,'' Davis
said. ``Now you're going to see it come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said the use of less expensive plastic fibers, when
combined with the dropping cost of light sources as the company
researches new models, will help bring the technology out of the
operating room.
</P>
<P>
   Brenner, the company's president, said major nonmedical
manufacturers already are interested in possible applications for
the company's technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every year in the computer industry, there are faster machines
for less money,'' Brenner said. ``That's what we intend to be for
the illumination technology industry.''

HARD-WORKING CIENFUEGOS IS TRYING TO GET GALAXY FIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Long after training ends and while most are
finishing their showers, it's not unusual to find 31-year-old
midfielder Mauricio Cienfuegos taking extra shots or finishing an
extra set of sit-ups.
</P>
<P>
   As the Los Angeles Galaxy playmaker enters the latter stages of
his career, fitness for the 5-foot-4 set-up man becomes extremely
important.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a big-time professional, his work ethic is first rate,''
Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid said. ``Sometimes you say at his age he
needs to do a little less, but more is what he feels comfortable
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Usually, Cienfuegos snags one of the younger players to help him
with his extra drills _ and he doesn't plan on slowing down now
that he's getting older.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've grown accustomed to it,'' Cienfuegos said. ``I may not be
the last one off the field all the time, but usually I am. Maybe
I'm wrong, but the older you get the more time you need to put in
to train.''
</P>
<P>
   The El Salvadoran has struggled recently, as has the Galaxy, but
he's hoping to help change all that this afternoon when Los Angeles
plays host to New England at the Rose Bowl at 4:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe his teammates should be out there a little longer with
him. Following last week's 1-0 loss to Tampa Bay, the Galaxy fell
to 4-5. The team has struggled offensively, netting only five goals
in nine games.
</P>
<P>
   Cienfuegos, who arrived to training camp late because of a
contract dispute with Major League Soccer, says the difference
between last year's team and this one is fitness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come to the conclusion that last year we had a great
preseason and we were very well prepared physically heading in,''
Cienfuegos said. ``This year that didn't happen and now we're
paying the price.''
</P>
<P>
   Cienfuegos may be paying the biggest price. He admits his timing
has been off, limiting his ability to feed the ball to the
necessary space for strikers Welton and Cobi Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been off in terms of rhythm and timing of my distance
(passes),'' Cienfuegos said. ``Once I get that going, we'll start
getting Cobi and Welton the ball in a timely manner.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the bulk of the offense flowed through Cienfuegos.
This season, he's had to work a lot harder to get touches.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's seeing some of the ball, but he can see a lot more of
it,'' said Schmid. ``Especially if we can take a lead. If that
happens, he'll see more of the ball because teams will come at us a
lot more, creating opportunities for us to play the ball through
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the lack of scoring this season isn't for lack of
chances. As Schmid has maintained the past two weeks, Cienfuegos
said the Galaxy misses a physical presence up front.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was our Achilles' heel last week,'' Cienfuegos said. ``We
had some crosses by the bunches and if we had a central striker
like (Carlos) Hermosillo, he would have probably knocked three of
those goals in. We've had the opportunities, but we do miss that
presence in the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Hermosillo is closer to returning. His Mexican team faces
elimination this weekend. If they should fall, he would need a
week's vacation prior to joining the Galaxy.

NORTHRIDGE FALLS, UCLA WINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ And so it goes with Cal State Northridge softball:
impressive sometimes but not impressive enough times.
</P>
<P>
   That pattern marked the Matadors during the Big West Conference
season, preventing them from sweeping opponents and defending their
title. And it marked them Saturday in the NCAA regional at UCLA
when second-seeded Missouri eliminated them with a 3-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   That's the same Missouri team that had never beaten fifth-seeded
Northridge (30-24) in six previous meetings, including Thursday's,
when the Matadors rocked Stephanie Falk's offspeed pitches for six
runs in the second inning en route to a 7-3 win.
</P>
<P>
   This time, CSUN collected seven hits but couldn't hit Falk
enough to sustain a rally. Although coach Janet Sherman said her
team adjusted to Falk's throwing outside (she threw inside
Thursday), Northridge left runners on third twice and scored its
lone run on a throwing error in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``She threw the same as our first game,'' Missouri coach Jay
Miller said, ``but she had better command of her pitches today.
When she is on, no one else is better in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Northridge had its chances. Katrina Nolletti doubled in
the fifth but stayed on second. So did Summer Richardson after she
pinch-doubled in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Pierce doubled to lead off the seventh and pinch
runner Michelle Wintermute reached third with two outs, but Jessica
Creith looked at strike three.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to be in that type of situation. That's what (the
game) is about,'' she said. ``Not being able to come through, it's
frustrating, but that's the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, one run wasn't enough for pitcher Tara Glaister,
just as it wasn't enough Friday against Minnesota. Glaister pitched
well enough to win, giving up five hits and striking out two, but
Missouri (40-20) rallied for three runs in the bottom of the sixth
on a hit batter, two singles and two sacrifice flies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have my best stuff all day,'' Glaister said. ``The
pops weren't there. It wasn't moving.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Finally, we hit the ball hard and did what we needed to do,''
Missouri coach Jay Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA 5, Minnesota 0: Stacey Nuveman hit two home runs and drove
in four to lead the top-seeded Bruins (58-6) to today's 1 p.m.
regional final against Missouri (41-20), which beat Northridge and
Minnesota Saturday. The winner advances to the College World Series
beginning Thursday in Oklahoma City, but Missouri needs to win
twice.
</P>
<P>
   Nuveman's two round-trippers, a solo shot against Steph Klaviter
(23-10) in the third and a three-run homer in the fifth off
Michelle Harrison, gave her 30 for the season, the first time a
UCLA player has reached that plateau and only the second time any
college player has done so. Arizona's Laura Espinoza hit 30 in 1994
and 37 the next year. Nuveman now has a nation-leading 89 RBI this
season, placing her eighth all-time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been struggling a bit as of late,'' Nuveman said. ``It
felt good to bust out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She took a pitch that was really low and outside and hit it
out,'' Minnesota co-coach Lisa Bernstein said of the second home
run. ``It would not have ever been called a strike.''
</P>
<P>
   Lyndsey Klein celebrated her 21st birthday with three hits,
including the game-winning solo home run in the third inning, her
fifth of the season. She also doubled and singled.
</P>
<P>
   Courtney Dale (30-1) became the fourth UCLA pitcher to win 30
games in a season with a two-hit shutout with eight strikeouts and
one walk. Dale had a no-hitter and faced the minimum through six
innings before giving up two singles to start the seventh. UCLA is
the only team in the nation not to have given up a run in a
regional.

   LOS ANGELES: all other parties.
</P>
<P>
   The site of the Crenshaw District party is still being planned,
but the Alameda Street party will run from Olvera Street to Union
Station, the Harbor event will be beneath the Vincent Thomas Bridge
_ which will be lighted for the first time by $400,000 in private
money _ and the Grand Avenue celebration downtown will be in front
of the Museum of Contemporary Art.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the community festivals will feature puppet shows,
carnival rides, storytelling, sports and hobby activities, stunt
demonstrations, yacht or classic car parades, dance lessons and
international crafts.
</P>
<P>
   Children's groups will perform, as will collections of 2,000
mariachis, 2,000 swing dancers, 2,000 tenors, 2,000 tuba and
trombone players and 2,000 jazz musicians in a millennial jam
session, among other groups.
</P>
<P>
   Four times during the day, the Opus 21 _ Festival of Sacred
Sounds will feature simultaneous sounding of bells, horns and
choirs from churches, temples and mosques throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
   This joyful noise will erupt at noon to open the city's
celebration; at 4 p.m., to recognize midnight Greenwich Mean Time,
the benchmark for time-keeping worldwide; at 9 p.m., when it will
be midnight on the East Coast and the United States enters 2000;
and at midnight local time.
</P>
<P>
   Bands and dancing for adults will start at 9 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   At 11:45 p.m., six locations will join in a count to midnight.
That will culminate in a ``sky show'' with simultaneous fireworks,
lasers, sky writing and other effects, Nodal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to try to animate the sky over L.A.,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In New York, if you look up, you see buildings,'' he said. But
in Los Angeles, the sky overhead is ``the one thing we have in
common.''

LOS ANGELES PROMISES DEC. 31 PARTY TO END ALL PARTIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY STEVE CARNEY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Promising a New Year's Eve that ``makes Times
Square look like bush league,'' organizers of the official Los
Angeles millennium celebration seem to have more bravado than time.
</P>
<P>
   With only seven months remaining until the cosmic odometer flips
to 2000, city officials still are lining up all the entertainers
and corporate donors.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, they promise a world-class, once-in-a-millennium
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have nothing against New York, but Los Angeles is where
it's happening. L.A. rocks,'' said Mark Kroeker, picked by Mayor
Richard Riordan to coordinate the city's bash.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for something spectacular for the people of Los
Angeles _ something that really makes L.A. shine. We want to unify
our city,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the clock is ticking.
</P>
<P>
   London is building a $418 million ``Millennium Dome,'' and
Paris, Rome, Chicago and other cities have been planning their
soirees for years. And New York City _ well, the Big Apple seems to
think it's the place to be, even though officials there are still
hammering out their plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``With it being New York City and New Year's Eve and the
millennium _ people for the most part are coming to us. They want
to be a part of NYC 2000 events,'' said Germaine Febles, deputy
director of New York's celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Kroeker is not impressed. His advice for Angelenos: ``Don't
leave Los Angeles. You'll be sorry you did.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll put together something that makes Times Square look like
bush league. L.A. is going to be the place to be on New Year's Eve.
It's going to be phenomenal,'' said the former Los Angeles Police
Department deputy chief.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he noted that Los Angeles is under pressure to present a
good show because it will be the last large city in the nation to
ring out 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bring the curtain down here,'' Kroeker said. ``We want to
make sure Los Angeles is ready to do a curtain call.''
</P>
<P>
   Riordan is confident Los Angeles can grab the spotlight and hang
onto it during its daylong celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to do something to show we're the entertainment
capital of the world,'' Riordan said. ``When it's midnight in New
York, it's 9 o'clock here and we want to get some attention.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the plan is for five simultaneous festivals throughout
the city, including one somewhere in the San Fernando Valley,
perhaps at Van Nuys Airport, Balboa Park or the Van Nuys government
center.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the city will be throwing a major celebration
in Hollywood featuring an aerial light show worthy of Tinseltown's
special-effects artists.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to blow out every other celebration in the
country,'' said Adolfo V. Nodal, general manager of the city's
Cultural Affairs Department. ``We have so much talent here. The
cultural resources are amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, officials are cagey about who will perform where,
promising they'll have everything nailed down within a month.
</P>
<P>
   The five admission-free, alcohol-free, family festivals around
the city will last from noon to midnight and host 50,000 to 100,000
people.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Kroeker said the city is planning ``something that
leaves a legacy for our children.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what legacy Kroeker promises is unclear _ a secret, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't just a park or a scholarship fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be based on the survival needs of young people for the
next millennium,'' he said. ``We want to do something that leaves
more than an empty champagne bottle in the street.''
</P>
<P>
   The City Council approved $1.2 million for the festivals, and
Kroeker said he's working to amass far more in corporate and
private donations to augment that cash. He declined to reveal who
has contributed so far.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say the city already is spending too much.
</P>
<P>
   ``There may be some value in what those folks want to do,'' said
Kris Vosburgh, executive director of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers
Association.
</P>
<P>
   But if that's the case, then participants should be willing to
pay a small admission charge, or companies should be interested
enough to foot the entire bill, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's galling because they're constantly coming forward saying
they need more money for essential services,'' he said of city
officials. ``Then at budget time they always find money for bells
and whistles. The attitude is, it's only $1.2million. But these
amounts add up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may sound like a Puritan here, but it's our money,''
Vosburgh said.
</P>
<P>
   The party planners insist any money spent is an investment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're tying the whole city together. We're trying to do
something wonderful for the people of L.A.,'' Nodal said.
</P>
<P>
   Each location of the festival will have large television screens
linking it with all other parties.

SPURS SPREAD THE WEALTH
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Tim Duncan was the best player on the floor
(again), and in a relieved locker room San Antonio paid proper
homage to their quiet prodigy (again).
</P>
<P>
   But Duncan's masterful 37-point, 14-rebound performance Saturday
at the Forum did not dominate the postgame discussion, not even
close. Instead, the Spurs distributed the credit as selflessly as
they distributed the ball in a devastating 103-91 victory over the
Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the topics ranged from point guard Avery Johnson's
fourth-quarter jumpers to reserve Jaren Jackson's season-high 22
points to the Spurs' overwhelming fourth quarter _ when they scored
36 points and shot 63 percent while the Lakers scored 25 points and
shot 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers had too much youth and athleticism for Houston, but
their flimsy fundamentals collapsed against the best the Spurs had
to offer in the closing minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say anything about the Lakers, but I will
talk about what we do in the fourth quarter,'' Johnson said. ``We
tend to execute really well. We make our free throws, and we don't
have any breakdowns on defense.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs have executed the same end-game principles with the
same personnel and the same coach for the entire season. They know
what to do and how to do it, and that cohesion was crucial in the
final minutes of Games 2 and 3. Meanwhile, the Lakers were in chaos
throughout the season and failed to create a foundation that would
withstand postseason pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``You build to a certain point, and we've been doing it for the
last 2{ months,'' Spurs center David Robinson said. ``A lot of it
is chemistry, and that's one thing we've been fortunate enough to
develop. That's the strength of our team. In terms of talent, we
aren't the most overwhelming team, but we work well together, and
that's what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   Game 3 was also about the Spurs' resourcefulness, about someone
other than Duncan _ and the foul-plagued Robinson, for that matter
_ making critical shots in the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan carried San Antonio in the first half with 24 points, but
when the Lakers applied double-team tactics in the closing minutes,
Johnson and Jackson calmly countered with perimeter jumpers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When teams have guys who step up, that's usually who's going
to win games, especially the close ones,'' Lakers guard Derek
Harper said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's performance was shocking, considering he was averaging
five points in the playoffs and made two baskets combined in Games
1 and 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was my turn to do something off the bench,''
Jackson said. ``Malik (Rose) was good in the last game (13 points).
We've been solid off the bench through the year. I just wanted to
make sure I did my share.''
</P>
<P>
   On the rare occasions the Lakers double-teamed Duncan and
contained Jackson, the crafty Johnson popped open to make two
19-foot jumpers in the final minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not leaving me open as much (as in recent years),''
Johnson said. ``But in the end, they decided to and fortunately ...
I was able to make the shots that really put a dagger in them.''

FREED POW GETS HERO'S WELCOME
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ Many residents in this small, all-American
town first met Army Spc. Steven Gonzales when he appeared on their
TV screens _ a bruised and bewildered soldier held captive in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Their hearts went out to Staff Sgt. Andrew Ramirez and Staff
Sgt. Christopher Stone, two more soldiers captured by Serbian
forces. But there was a special tie to Gonzales: His parents, Rosie
and Gilbert Gonzales, live and work in Huntsville.
</P>
<P>
   The soldier on the TV screen immediately became the city's
``adopted son.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, in a downtown parade and ceremony befitting a hero,
hundreds of proud, flag-waving residents embraced a
different-looking Gonzales: a fresh-faced kid with a charming
smile, dark eyebrows and his father's gentle disposition.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales, who was freed May 2, rode through downtown Huntsville
in the back of a white 1963 Rolls Royce convertible. Looking
healthy and seemimg unruffled by the swarm of news media, he
grinned and gave a thumbs-up to the throngs shouting, ``Welcome
home, Steven.''
</P>
<P>
   The celebration included a birthday party at a mall for
Gonzales, who turned 22 while in captivity, as well as a ceremony
at Sam Houston State University, where local, state and national
officials praised Gonzales and his family. The parade also honored
prisoners of war and those missing in action.
</P>
<P>
   Parade-goers with miniature American flags tucked in their hats,
hair, pockets and shirts praised Gonzales for remaining a loyal
soldier during 32 days' captivity. And they thanked God for his
release.
</P>
<P>
   But most said their greatest feeling of pride came from watching
Gonzales conduct himself respectfully and modestly at a time when
youths are portrayed so negatively.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so young, and has come through this with such maturity,''
said Jim Montgomery, 73, a Navy veteran. ``You hear so much about
young people today.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales behaved in a manner reminiscent of ``the 20-year-olds
that went off to World War II,'' Montgomery said. ``He just seems
to be a good, all-around, nice young man.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales, who said he survived with help from prayers and hymns
memorized at church camp, responded emotionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to thank our great Lord. He was my strength and my
refuge and so much more to me during my captivity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He thanked the crowd for supporting him and his family, but said
that more significant are ``our service members ... who have walked
before me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Without them, I would not have had the opportunity to uphold
these ideals,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also thanked those still in military service, adding that he
hopes they will receive such a welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales and his family stopped once along the parade route, at
the front lawn of the Walker County Courthouse. There, Steven
Gonzales cut the yellow ribbon that his mother had placed around a
sprawling tree the day after he was taken hostage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very emotional moment. It meant the world to be able
to take it down,'' Rosie Gonzales said, holding the ribbon.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzales, Ramirez and Stone were part of a U.N. peacekeeping
force when they were captured by Yugoslav forces March 31 as they
patrolled the Macedonian border.
</P>
<P>
   An American religious delegation led by the Rev. Jesse Jackson
negotiated their release.

LEAPIN' LOCALS OUTJUMP FURRIN FROGS AT TEXAS FESTIVAL
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE WORTH, Texas _ In a ribbitting display of froggery, Jacob
King's local leaper legged it out of the taped-down circle quicker
than Amanda Bentley's ``foreign'' frog for first place in the
junior high division Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for an unnamed novice still wet behind the tympani,
recruited as he was just the night before the 16th annual Lake
Worth Bullfrog Festival.
</P>
<P>
   Although jumpy festival organizers flew in seven New York frogs
to make sure they had enough contestants for the frog-jumping
contest, King and other locals popped in at race time with a horde
of home-grown hoppers that proved to be a leap above the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``I caught him last night at my tank,'' said King, an Azle
Junior High student whose family lives on 368 acres in Northwest
Tarrant County.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time, we caught over 28 one night. We only caught nine
last night, because we were only out about 30 minutes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also catch them and eat 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   Mottled green thighs pumped and webbed feet flew as the frogs _
well, some of them _ hopped hurriedly from inside a small circle to
the outskirts of a 5-foot sphere taped on a wooden stage.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Covin and his sons Trevor, 9, and Cody, 7, of Lake Worth
took home a first place and a participant's ribbon with their
slimers, captured Friday night at Lake Benbrook.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just sit there and be quiet, and they'll honk,'' Covin
advised.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the biggest and best bullfrogs we've had for the
races,'' said Northwest Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Judy
Haas, whose daughter has been tending the out-of-state amphibians.
</P>
<P>
   Although some of the competitors were slipped back into buckets
and coolers after strutting their stuff, others sat in their
keepers' hands, clasped tightly but being gently rubbed on their
smooth, slimy backs.
</P>
<P>
   Haas said the New Yorkers will go to a local pond or the Fort
Worth Nature Center &AMP; Refuge.
</P>
<P>
   King and his buddy Micah Collier, 13, who took a third place,
said they will probably hang on to theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll keep them to make them bigger for next year,'' Collier
said.

GONZALEZ'S LATE HOMER LIFTS RANGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
BALTIMORE _ The Rangers played seven games short-handed while right
fielder Juan Gonzalez nursed the strain in his right hamstring.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Yet, the Rangers never considered placing Gonzalez on the 15-day
disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's ninth inning at Oriole Park in Camden Yards _ where
Gonzalez's three-run homer off Baltimore's Ricky Bones propelled
the Rangers to an 8-7 victory _ revealed their reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers expect their two-time American League most valuable
player will contribute more during the eight games in which he
plays than any replacement from Triple-A Oklahoma would during the
span of 15 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was willing to trade seven days for eight,'' Rangers manager
Johnny Oates said. ``That's a profit of one. You don't want to lose
him for 15 days. You might even be willing to trade 10 days for
five with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who went hitless during his first eight at-bats since
returning to the lineup Friday, nullified Rangers rookie reliever
Jeff Zimmerman's first failure this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles scored the go-ahead runs with Zimmerman on the mound
in the seventh and eighth innings only to witness closer Mike
Timlin fail to convert a save for the fourth time in 10
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Timlin, who recorded the final two outs of the eighth inning,
surrendered a leadoff double to center fielder Roberto Kelly and
issued a four-pitch walk to second baseman Mark McLemore to begin
the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Timlin then induced a weak ground ball to the mound from Rusty
Greer. Timlin fielded it cleanly, but his throw to third baseman
Cal Ripken sailed wide of the bag and deflected off the infielder's
glove and into shallow left field.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first thought was, `Wow! Lead runner,' '' Timlin said.
``Had I thrown it, I would have hit him in the chest. I just babied
it over there, though, and threw it away.''
</P>
<P>
   Kelly scored from second, and McLemore raced to third. Orioles
manager Ray Miller summoned Bones from the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who acknowledged his timing at the plate being amiss
from the injury, stepped to the plate hitting .125 (3-for-24) for
his career against Bones. The right-hander threw a first-pitch
curveball that missed the strike zone, and Gonzalez fouled a 1-0
slider down the right-field line.
</P>
<P>
   That foul ball would be an encouraging sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good things happen when you stay behind the ball,'' Oates
said. ``He was going to make sure he got that run in. It was good
to see him do that against a guy he hasn't had much success
against.''
</P>
<P>
   Bones threw a second consecutive slider, and Gonzalez drove it
down the right-field line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just looking for a long fly ball to drive in that run,''
said Gonzalez, whose home runs rarely travel to right field.
</P>
<P>
   The ball cleared Camden Yards' 25-foot-high scoreboard, and
closer John Wetteland _ despite allowing a solo home run to Delino
DeShields _ converted his 13th save in 14 opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's never thrown me anything close to the middle of the plate
that I could hit out of the park,'' Gonzalez said of Bones. ``It
was my turn today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles appeared well on their way to victory after
eighth-inning, run-scoring singles by right fielder Rich Amaral
(3-for-4) and first baseman Jeff Conine, who went 4-for-5 with
three runs batted in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty much a cryin' shame to battle that hard all day
and have tremendous days from Conine and Amaral and a key hit from
Ripken,'' Miller said. ``Then, two of our veteran relievers came
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Timlin and left-hander Jesse Orosco, who failed to retire a
batter, issued three walks during the eighth and ninth innings.
That ensured Gonzalez of one more plate appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I've said before, you can't walk people at the bottom of
the lineup,'' Miller said, ``because sooner or later the big boy
ends up there at the plate doing just like Gonzalez did.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why the Rangers never placed Gonzalez on the disabled
list. nn

KRAFT TIES COURSE RECORD WITH 61, SHARES LEAD AT COLONIAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Greg Kraft should be glad he makes his
living by playing professional golf, not predicting its outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft wrapped up a third-round effort of 61 Saturday at the
MasterCard Colonial, tying the course record. After a clinical
dissection of his 10 birdies and lone bogey, Kraft explained why
the effort left him pleased but far from exuberant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I won't be leading going into the last round,'' said
Kraft, whose record-tying round moved him to 7 under par for the
tournament. ``Somebody's going to get to 12 or 13 under, with the
way the course is playing. I'll probably be five shots back and
have to post another number.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprise!
</P>
<P>
   Despite his meager expectations, Kraft heads into today's final
round as one of three players with a share of the lead. He is
joined by Scott Verplank and Billy Mayfair, who fashioned rounds of
66 and 68, respectively, while playing under more adverse
conditions during the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   As the day progressed, Colonial's greens dried out under sunny,
cloudless skies, causing difficulties with approach shots for
players with afternoon tee times. Kraft experienced no such
problems with a 9:19 a.m. start, climbing 51 spots on the leader
board by matching the course record held by Keith Clearwater and
Lee Janzen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit it close all day,'' said Kraft, who had only two birdie
putts longer than six feet, along with a 60-foot chip-in at No. 18.
``The greens were really soft and receptive.''
</P>
<P>
   Those were not the words used by Phil Mickelson (5 under), who
played in the next-to-last group and said he hit a 4-iron shot at
No. 4 that stopped ``quicker than any of the sand wedges I hit on
the back nine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the golf course played totally different in the
morning than in the afternoon,'' said Mickelson, who wondered aloud
if Colonial's greens had been watered before the start of the third
round, giving an edge to morning starters. ``They were very soft
for the first half of the players, and it got very firm for the
second half. I'm a big advocate of firm greens, but I advocate firm
greens for everyone. It's important that the course plays the same
way for everyone, whether it's hard or soft.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Russell, PGA Tour tournament official, said whatever
difference occurred in Saturday's scoring conditions resulted from
Mother Nature, not a early-hours irrigation project. Russell said
the Colonial greens have been hand-watered at the conclusion of
play each day but no water has been added in the mornings before
the start of rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been the same every day,'' Russell said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, Kraft capitalized on his early start better
than anyone else in the field, taking birdies on his first three
holes to begin the day and his final four to conclude it. He joins
Verplank and Mayfair atop a final-round leader board that shows 31
golfers within five strokes of the lead and 44 within seven shots.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how many players remained in contention in the well-packed
field, Verplank said: ``About 40. Maybe 50.''
</P>
<P>
   Verplank added his name to the list with an effort that included
his second consecutive eagle at No. 11, a 599-yard par-5. Verplank
made a 35-foot eagle putt Saturday, moving him to 5 under par at
No. 11 and 2 under for his remaining 51 holes during the 1999
Colonial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played as good as I can play,'' said Verplank, who had two
bogeys during a round of 66 that marked the best effort by an
afternoon starter in the third round. ``These greens were hard and
bouncy. To shoot a 61 out here ... that's pretty awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfair turned in his third consecutive sub-par effort, joining
Fred Funk (5 under overall) and Tim Herron (4 under) as the only
players to break par in each round. Although he joined Verplank in
heaping praise upon Kraft for his course record, Mayfair suggested
another 61 is unlikely to be uncorked by any of today's
front-runners.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the wind keeps blowing and it stays sunny, it's going to be
hard on the leaders,'' Mayfair said. ``If someone goes off (early)
and posts a 63 or 64, they have a great chance of winning.''
</P>
<P>
   The post-and-wait method worked Saturday for Kraft, even though
it caught him off-guard. If someone follows his lead today, they
could be wearing a plaid jacket. nn

CHANGES TO COURSE AFFECT BROOKS' GAME
</HEADLINE>
 NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF CAPLAN, J. DOUGLAS FOSTER, TROY PHILLIPS AND KEVIN LYONS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Mark Brooks hasn't exactly experienced home
cooking on his hometown golf course. The Fort Worth native carded
an even-par 70 Saturday to finish where he started the day, at 2
over.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks said the setup of the Colonial course, as dictated during
tournament week by PGA Tour officials, is much different than what
he's used to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll give you an example,'' Brooks said. ``The 12th hole, a
dogleg left into the wind, you normally cannot drive it into the
right bunker off the tee, at all. And it's really in play; 290
yards into the wind and you can knock it into the bunker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sit out here and watch the guys play 18, they're using a sand
wedge. I use an occasional wedge in there, but it's usually more an
8-, 9-iron shot. It's pretty pitiful. You can step out there and
watch two or three groups and you see them, they're rolling 80
yards. I'm used to the ball rolling 20 or 30 yards. It makes a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as my game, I just haven't made enough putts to really
get going.'' MICKELSON TO MISS OPEN?
</P>
<P>
   Phil Mickelson said that there is a chance he could miss this
year's U.S. Open, scheduled for June 17-20 at Pinehurst No. 2 in
North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   With his wife, Amy, eight months pregnant, Mickelson said the
arrival of the couple's first child could be very near the Open
dates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'm going to be able to play that this year to
be honest,'' Mickelson said. ``I'll have to play it by ear.'' STILL
A RACE
</P>
<P>
   By no means is the MasterCard Colonial a three-man battle.
Co-leader Greg Kraft knows that.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft entered the third round 9 strokes behind the leaders
before shooting a 61 early in the day. Entering the final round,
there are 53 players within 9 strokes of leaders Kraft, Scott
Verplank and Billy Mayfair. SURGING WATSON
</P>
<P>
   As defending champion Tom Watson came strolling up No. 18 at
around 11:20 a.m. Saturday, he met a pleasantly surprised throng.
</P>
<P>
   Having barely survived the cut with a two-day 144 (4 over),
Watson regained his 1998 form to shoot a 66 for an even-par 210
after three rounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was better than Saturday and a lot better than the day
before,'' said Watson, who had no bogeys after carding a combined
eight in the first two rounds. ``It looked like I was going to miss
the cut, and I made it right into the money. I had nothing to lose
today, so I played with abandon.''
</P>
<P>
   Since opening with a 74, Watson's swing has been in ``adjustment
mode.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My caddy, Bruce Edwards, and I ended up in a much better frame
of mind after today's round,'' Watson said. ``It was kind of a
scruffy round on the back side, and the 66 just happened.''
LEHMAN'S HOT ROUND
</P>
<P>
   When he bogeyed two of the first four holes, Tom Lehman must
have thought Saturday's third round would be a long one. But Lehman
rebounded to make six birdies and an eagle on No. 11 to card a
6-under-par 64.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times when you have great rounds like that you get
off to a good start,'' said Lehman, who knocked in 30-foot putts on
Nos. 11 and 12. ``I had some early bogeys, but, if you will, they
were good bogeys. I hit some good shots they just didn't fall. I
kept playing with confidence and the shots started falling.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, the 1996 British Open Champion who is ``85 percent''
after shoulder surgery in November, is at 4-under-par 206 through
the first three rounds of the tournament. nn

ZIMMERMAN SETS TEAM RECORD THEN FALTERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
BALTIMORE _ Right-hander Jeff Zimmerman established a Rangers
record for a reliever yesterday by retiring his 24th and 25th
consecutive batters.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The two batters: Baltimore's B.J. Surhoff and Albert Belle.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman then tasted failure for the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-year-old rookie surrendered three consecutive two-out
singles in the seventh inning, and the Orioles took a 4-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers tied the score in the eighth inning when
pinch-runner Luis Alicea scored on a one-out ground ball by first
baseman Lee Stevens, but Zimmerman again surrendered the lead by
allowing a run-scoring single to right fielder Rich Amaral in the
bottom half of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball has a great way of bringing you back down to earth
and planting you six feet under,'' Zimmerman said.
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman entered the day with the best earned-run average
(0.61) and lowest opponents' batting average (.084) of any
major-league reliever, but yesterday proved he is human.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew he was before today,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates
said. ``A nice run? That's putting it mildly.''
</P>
<P>
   How will Zimmerman respond?
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't have much concern about that,'' pitching coach
Dick Bosman said. ``He's a hard-nosed kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Zimmerman: ``I'm not going to try and do anything
different.'' \Nsubheds:Quality results With the 8-7 victory against
the Orioles, the Rangers have won 10 of the 11 games this season in

\Nshirt:Briefly _ First baseman Lee Stevens, who entered
yesterday's game leading the American League in intentional walks,
drew his seventh with two out and Rafael Palmeiro on second base in
the sixth inning. Stevens' intentional walks can be attributed to
his performance _ a .315 batting average and nine home runs _ and
the lack of production by the Rangers' No. 9 hitters batting behind
him. _ Catcher Ivan Rodriguez's fourth-inning home run extended his
hitting streak to 12 games, the best by a Rangers player this
season. _ The ninth-inning home run by Baltimore's Delino DeShields
was the third homer surrendered by closer John Wetteland in his
past three appearances. _ Orioles first baseman Will Clark
(fracture, left thumb) returned to Baltimore yesterday, but don't
expect him to be reinstated from the 15-day disabled list before
tonight's game. Clark, the Rangers' first baseman from 1994-98,
went 3-for-6 with three walks while playing in the Orioles'
extended spring-training program yesterday morning in Sarasota,
Fla. The Orioles, though, appear to be targeting Clark's return for
Tuesday at Anaheim. _ Orioles left fielder B.J. Surhoff extended
his hitting streak to 13 games with his second-inning, run-scoring
single. Surhoff enters tonight's game hitting .370 (10-for-27) in
six games against the Rangers this season.

<P>
   ``It's great,'' Mavis Leno, the comedian's wife, says of his
love for cars. ``I don't understand people who don't have a passion
for something.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a few things he does that make me a little nervous,
like when he drives his old steam-powered cars, which are a little
dangerous,'' she continued. ``He drives a lot of very old cars and
motorcycles where the technology was better on speed than it was on
brakes. But he's always 100percent alert and he has a very good
reaction time, so I count on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jay Leno is a regular at classic car shows around Los Angeles.
And, of course, every night millions of Americans see him whiz by
NBC studios in Burbank during the ``Tonight Show's'' opening
sequence.
</P>
<P>
   But, Leno insists, his obsession with restoring and driving cars
and motorcycles doesn't put him in the same class as Indy drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Driving is like sex,'' he said. ``A lot of guys think they're
pretty good at it. Everyone knows how to drive, for the most part,
so they think race car driving is like regular driving _ only
faster. And, of course, it isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Leno shudders at the thought of being a grinning rich guy who
haunts racetracks in flame-retardant Nomex jumpsuits, pretending he
has the skills and know-how to race professionally. He has too much
respect for racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's sort of the more-money-than-brains club,'' he said.
``Racing is not something you can really do part time. I don't even
pretend to put myself in the same category with those guys. But to
just go around the track at high speed and get a sense of what they
do every day is very exciting.''

JAY LENO ISN'T WORRIED ABOUT PACING INDY 500
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY PHIL DAVIS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jay Leno isn't worried about pacing the Indy 500
next week. Taking Indy's deadly curves at 125 mph in a brand-new
Chevy Monte Carlo is nothing compared with cruising Mulholland
Drive in one of his shakier vintage cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have cars that necessarily go fast,'' he said of his
collection of 54 cars and 53 motorcycles. ``I have the kind of cars
that people are amazed you are physically able to get to your
destination.''
</P>
<P>
   Take his two-cylinder, three-wheel Morgan.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty loud, it's pow, pow, pow,'' Leno said. ``I'm on
Mulholland Drive one day and I come sliding around this corner and
I see a cop there with his radar gun and I think, `Ah, I'm
screwed,' and then I go by and he goes, `Hi Jay, how are you
doing?' And I realize I'm only going 33mph. But it's so frightening
in this thing. It's the kind of car where you're scared to death,
you're holding on for dear life and girls are passing you putting
on their lipstick in Honda Civics.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say the ``Tonight Show'' host doesn't expect major
thrills when he leads the pack in front of more than 300,000 fans
at the 83rd running of the Indianapolis 500 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It's a rare honor _ even for America's top comedian.
</P>
<P>
   Most Indy pacers are racing greats like Parnelli Jones, who took
first in the 1963 Indianapolis. But Leno's well-known passion for
cars put him among the elite ranks of Indy 500 VIPs such as U.S.
Air Force Gen. Chuck Yeager, the test pilot who set a speed record
in 1947 when he broke the sound barrier, and actor James Garner,
whose starring role in the 1966 movie ``Grand Prix'' kicked his
love of racing into high gear. Yeager paced Indy in 1986; Garner in
1975, 1977 and 1985.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite an honor,'' Garner said. ``Driving the pace car is
about keeping your concentration _ ignoring 300,000 fans and 33
high-performance cars raring to go right behind you.''
</P>
<P>
   Garner, who has faithfully attended the Indy 500 almost every
year since 1958 and counts dozens of drivers among his friends,
said pacing Indy is a unique thrill topped only by his experiences
racing on courses from Daytona to Baja.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get in a race head to head with someone, there's
nothing better,'' Garner said. ``At Indy, you're just pacing. But
it is the biggest race in the world. And at least I led for a
little while.''
</P>
<P>
   As this year's official pace car driver, Leno is responsible for
making sure 33 of the best drivers in the world get off to a good,
fast start. He will take the fire-engine red Monte Carlo pace car
up to 125 mph in several laps around the 2{-mile oval before diving
into pit row as the racers blast off at speeds that reach 236 mph.
Crashes and other track mishaps slow average race speeds down to a
still-dizzying 145 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Leno was trained on the course by Indy champ Jones, who paced
last year's race. ``Indianapolis is a very complicated track to
drive,'' Leno said. ``When we were practicing with the pace car,
Parnelli would take the wheel and we'd be going 100 mph and we're
just touching the wall with the mirror. It's measured in inches.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why both Leno and Garner hold the Indy racers in the
highest regard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exciting,'' Leno said. ``To me, race car drivers like
Mario Andretti, Phil Hill and Dan Gurney are just as much athletes
as Michael Jordan or Mickey Mantle or whoever. It's just a
different kind of sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Joseph Haraszti, a Pasadena psychiatrist with close ties to
the racing community, said it's not surprising ``Type AAA
personality'' overachievers like Leno, Garner and actor Paul Newman
are drawn to the thrill of fast machines.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who are highly successful, highly driven,''
he said. ``They have this need to push themselves to the limit and
conquer new worlds.''
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing new about America's passion for cars, he added,
and the only difference between celebrities and regular guys is
what they can afford.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Garner and Newman, Leno's love of driving has rarely led
him to the racetrack. He has done a few celebrity races, but other
than that, the closest he's come to breaking a speed record was the
one time he was suspended from Andover High School in Massachusetts
for burning rubber in his '65 Buick Gransport.
</P>
<P>
   That was the beginning of a lifelong love of anything with
wheels and a motor. After rising through the stand-up comedy ranks
and inheriting the ``Tonight Show'' throne from Johnny Carson in
1992, Leno put his considerable wealth into a car collection that
has grown exponentially with his increasing fame. (His collection
totaled 16 motorcycles and roughly half a dozen cars back in 1987,
when he first starting filling in for Carson on a regular basis.)
Leno's collection now includes 107 vehicles, among them eccentric
rides like the three-wheel Morgan and more mainstream autos like a
Jaguar XJ-8 and a Dodge Viper.

HOLLANDSWORTH GETS SHOT AT FIRST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said he
would find ways to get Todd Hollandsworth's bat into the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   He did Saturday by playing the left-handed hitting outfielder in
an unexpected place. Hollandsworth, who started five games in
spring training at first base, started there in place of Eric
Karros.
</P>
<P>
   Both players accepted the move, but neither were tickled about
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it as an opportunity to get in the lineup,''
Hollandsworth said before the Dodgers and St. Louis played
Saturday. ``I'd like it more if I was in the outfield. I like
roaming around out there. I've been waiting (to play) for a long
time. I've been waiting for it all year. It's been a tough
stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing in place of the injured Devon White in center field,
Hollandsworth went 8 for 24 during a seven-game stretch last week,
raising his average from .214 to .289. Johnson said he plans on
rotating Hollandsworth into the outfield mix as well in order to
rest some of the veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to keep 25 guys as fresh as I can keep them,'' Johnson
said. ``(Hollandsworth) was swinging the bat well. I can't let him
die over there. Karros isn't liking it. He's a horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Karros felt the brunt of this one. Two years ago he
played in all 162 games. After an injury kept him out of the first
21 games last season, he played in 139 of the Dodgers' last 141
games.
</P>
<P>
   This was the third time in 42 games this season he wasn't in the
starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like taking a day off,'' said Karros, who is hitting
.272 with 22 RBI. ``Maybe if we had a stretch of 20 games in a row
(without an off-day) I would (understand it).''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Johnson does have experience with veterans who want
to play every day. He managed Cal Ripken Jr. in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was an adjustment for me because I could see when Cal
could use a day off and I could put another guy in there,'' Johnson
said. ``But there was the streak.''
</P>
<P>
   Young late scratch: Johnson had to alter his original lineup
because second baseman Eric Young was unable to play. Johnson said
Young, the usual leadoff hitter, was taken out of the lineup
because of a sore left ankle, which he injured last weekend in St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's probably out (today) and hopefully he'll be all right for
the road trip,'' Johnson said. ``He was on the trainer's table all
day and he came out and tried to hit and it was too sore.''
</P>
<P>
   With utility infielder Jose Vizcaino on the disabled list
Johnson turned to Tripp Cromer to start. Devon White was moved from
sixth to first, Dave Hansen from eighth to sixth while Cromer hit
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Extra bases: Reliever Antonio Osuna, who had a bone spur
surgically removed Thursday, was at Dodger Stadium on Friday and
said his elbow felt better than it has in years. ``Nothing wrong,''
Osuna said. ``I can feel there's nothing there. It's better than
(after last September's surgery).'' Osuna is expected to miss two
months.... Friday an error was given to Karros on a ball third
baseman Adrian Beltre threw in the dirt. It was changed to an error
by Beltre before Saturday's game, giving Beltre three errors in the
game.

ARSON SUSPECTED TN FIRE THAT KILLED THREE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By KIT R. ROANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three men were killed and 13 other tenants were
injured early Saturday when fire engulfed their apartment building
in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn, forcing many
residents to leap from second- and third-story windows.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials who were investigating the fire said
they believed that it was started by a drunken tenant who was angry
about being denied the use of the landlord's car late Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of the landlord eventually gave the tenant the keys and
he drove off, the officials and residents said. But, the officials
said, the man returned to the building shortly before 5 a.m.,
opened the front door and began screaming as he splashed gasoline
from the second-floor landing to the first floor, then dropped a
lighted match. The police said they knew the identity of the
suspect, but would not divulge his name.
</P>
<P>
   The building's sprinkler system was not working, officials said,
and the flames engulfed the front door and raced up the stairs,
trapping all the occupants inside as the man left again in the
landlord's car.
</P>
<P>
   Fire Chief Michael Canty, of Battalion 57, said, ``There is
flammable liquid found in the hallway on the second floor and we
are doing an investigation into arson.''
</P>
<P>
   Another fire official, Deputy Chief Philip J. Burns, of Division
11 in Brooklyn, said that workers from the Department of
Environmental Protection had begun excavating around a water pipe
in the street to determine why the sprinklers in the building never
went off.
</P>
<P>
   Fire officials said that the three men who died _ ages 30, 34
and 47 _ appeared to have suffered severe burns and severe smoke
inhalation. Their names were not immediately released by the
police, pending notification of their families. Relatives of the
47-year-old victim, however, identified him as as Ben Mixson.
</P>
<P>
   The injured tenants were being treated at Kings County Hospital
Center for cuts, scrapes and broken bones they suffered when they
leapt from the building, at 454 Greene Avenue, near Nostrand
Avenue. Officials said the most seriously injured of the group
broke a pelvic bone and that none of the injuries were
life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   A couple who crawled out a window on the first floor were
treated at the scene for smoke inhalation, fire officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire started suddenly, throwing the image of flickering
flames across neighborhood windows, and waking residents on the
block with loud popping that at first sounded like gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing sounded like an explosion and gunshots, and
then we heard glass shattering,'' said Carla Olvin, 24, who lives
next door. ``We called 911, ran out of the house, and saw that the
whole place was in flames.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of smoke and some of it was coming into our
house. The cops were pulling people out of windows and people were
jumping out of other windows.''
</P>
<P>
   She and other neighbors added that the police had been called to
the house many times in the past during what appeared to be
domestic disturbances.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that there appeared to have been one such quarrel on
Friday night, adding, ``We heard fighting last night and there
always was a lot of fighting, but as far as we know they never hurt
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that the police were first sent to the building
Saturday shortly after an assault was reported, but no arrests were
made because the angry tenant who is suspected of setting the fire
had left by then and the officers decided that it had been little
more than an argument, said Lt. Sean Crowley, a Police Department
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Four officers on patrol were the first to reach the scene. When
they arrived, two residents on the first floor were trying to break
open their front window to escape the smoke filling their
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this raging fire coming out of the front door and
off the roof,'' said Officer Michael Knott, 32, adding that his
attention was caught by the man and woman banging on their window.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were screaming for help and he was trying to break the
window from inside but couldn't,'' Knott said. ``I picked up a
half-full garbage can and hit it but had to do it twice, then tried
to climb up on a wooden bench but it was too low. Finally a
neighbor came with a ladder. In a matter of seconds their apartment
was engulfed in flames.''
</P>
<P>
   As the officers helped the couple out the window, they said,
other residents were jumping from the second and third floors.
Moments later, firefighters working their way up through the
building found an unconscious and badly burned man in a
second-floor closet. Another was found nearby, while a third was
discovered on the third-floor landing, fire officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The burned-out building was a haven for those down on their luck
and in need of help, residents and neighbors said.
</P>
<P>
   One resident, J.T. Bowman, said that he suffered from
schizophrenia and that the other occupants of the three-story
brownstone, six men and two women, were on medication for mental
conditions or receiving counseling for drug and alcohol abuse.
</P>
<P>
   He said they paid their rent of $300 to $400 with Supplemental
Security Income checks.
</P>
<P>
   He said he felt lucky because he was in the hospital at the time
of the fire. ``I got hit by a car,'' he said, adding that when he
was released from the hospital Saturday morning, ``the whole place
was burned down.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I should think, but I'm going to have to
find a place to live,'' he added. ``Maybe being hit by the car
wasn't so bad because I probably would have been inside sleeping.''
</P>
<P>
   Family members said Mixson, one of the victims, was a handyman.
``He was a nice person who just liked to joke around,'' said
Philtrice Mixson, 27, his niece. ``I'll miss him.''

DAVIS ALLEN, 82, DESIGNER OF MODERN BUSINESS INTERIORS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC PACE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Davis Allen, a prolific designer of modern business interiors
and furniture who spent 40 years at the firm of Skidmore, Owings &AMP;
Merrill, died on May 13 at Broward General Hospital in Fort
Lauderdale, Fla. He was 82 and lived in Fort Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
   During his career, Allen had major responsibility for the
interior design of the Istanbul Hilton, the Inland Steel Co.
headquarters in Chicago, the Mauna Kea Beach Hotel in Hawaii and
the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library in Austin, Texas, among other
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Maeve Slavin, a writer on design, said in her book ``Davis
Allen: 40 Years of Interior Design at Skidmore, Owings &AMP; Merrill''
(1990), that he was an institution in ``the profession he helped to
establish _ the total design of the interior corporate environment
with furniture, art, and functional and decorative objects
integrated into a comprehensively planned space.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen joined the firm in 1950 as a junior architectural
designer, became an associate partner in 1965 and retired in 1990.
He was the senior interior designer for more than 50 projects in
his firm's New York, Chicago and San Francisco offices.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, he was one of the first 15 inductees of the Interior
Design Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   Allen also designed a slat-back chair, called the Andover chair,
made of natural or lacquered beechwood. Its shape was reminiscent
of antique Windsor chairs and it was widely used in his own
interiors and those designed by others. Allen said that the design
was meant to achieve ``an American look,'' and that ``it looks most
like the highchair I sat in when I was a child.''
</P>
<P>
   Another of his designs, the Bridgehampton chair, has been
described as an updated and shiny example of a Shaker-style
slat-back chair.
</P>
<P>
   Allen was born in Ames, Iowa, and grew up in Iowa and Illinois.
He attended Brown University briefly and later studied at the
National Swedish Institute for Building Research, in Stockholm,
where he was impressed by how Swedish arts and crafts were being
integrated into interior designs.
</P>
<P>
   He went on to study at Yale's School of Architecture, with time
out for Army service in World War II. After working for the
architectural firm of Harrison &AMP; Abramovitz, he moved to Skidmore,
Owings &AMP; Merrill in New York.
</P>
<P>
   His survivors include his companion, Juan Garcia of Fort
Lauderdale, and three brothers, A.F., of Batavia, Ill., Thomas, of
Santa Fe, N.M., and Douglas, of Dourdan, France.

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,

list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)

<P>
   &UR; DESPERATE CHARACTERS &LR;  By Paula Fox. Norton, $12. In this trim,
intensely focused 1970 novel, an upper-middle-class New York woman
is bitten on the hand by a stray cat, setting off a chain of events
that mirror the confusion and bitterness in her loveless marriage.
The New York Times reviewer Peter Rowley praised ``the skillful
insistency with which Fox probes her characters' lives'' and ``her
acute sense of individual and social psychology.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A SOLDIER'S STORY &LR;  By Omar N. Bradley. Modern Library, $17.95.
As the commander of more soldiers in the field than any other
officer in American history, General of the Army Omar Bradley was
uniquely placed to assess the ups and downs of the European
campaign in World War II. ``The highest service'' of his candid,
balanced memoir, Hanson W. Baldwin wrote in 1951, ``is to provide a
gallery of military portraits, a background of personalities,
against which the war in North Africa, Sicily, France and Germany
was fought.''
</P>
<P>
   In  &UR; ECLIPSE &LR; , by Alan Moorehead (Soho, $13), a British war
correspondent recalls his experiences covering the Allied offensive
and the grunts and officers he encountered along the way. Reviewing
this ``fine narrative'' in 1946, Charles Poore said, ``You have an
eerie feeling ... that he wandered untrammeled from one end of the
war to the other.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GIVE US THIS DAY &LR; , by Sidney Stewart (Norton, $13.95), is a
harrowing narrative of the Pacific war by an American enlisted man
who survived the Bataan Death March and three years in Japanese
captivity. ``Through its immense picture of human courage in the
face of suffering, it reinforces our faith in the ultimate triumph
of man's spirit,'' David Dempsey wrote in 1957. ``It is
unforgettable.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE TREATMENT &LR;  By Daniel Menaker. Washington Square/Pocket
Books, $14. Jake Singer is motherless, aimless and lonely, but his
biggest challenge may be coping with his ferocious Cuban Catholic
analyst, who sees himself as ``the last Freudian.'' Last year the
reviewer Jim Shepard called this first novel ``an ethically
instructive comedy'' that is ``admirable for both its craft and its
humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BEACH: THE HISTORY OF PARADISE ON EARTH &LR;  By Lena Lencek and
Gideon Bosker. Penguin, $13.95. This eccentric chronicle of beach
culture from the Romans to the Californians includes a bibliography
with 335 entries and the authors' picks of the world's top 80
resorts. The result is an ``entertaining, handsomely illustrated
book'' that manages to be both ``scholarly and briskly
good-humored,'' Alexander Frater wrote last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PHILISTINES AT THE HEDGEROW: PASSION AND PROPERTY IN THE
HAMPTONS &LR; , by Steven Gaines (Back Bay/Little, Brown, $14.95),
explores life on the eastern tip of Long Island, N.Y., and the
parade of artists, charmers, socialites and celebrities who have
walked its beaches. In 1998 the reviewer Jennifer Steinhauer found
the book to be overstuffed with gossip but said it featured
``engaging ... tales of the social, ethnic and architectural
history of one of the most exclusive summer resort areas in
America.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IN SEARCH OF LOVE AND BEAUTY &LR;  By Ruth Prawer Jhabvala.
Counterpoint, $14. The author's first work of fiction set in
America focuses on a charismatic European refugee who becomes a
guru in New York, and the circle of uprooted ladies to whose bodies
and souls he ministers. In 1983 Robert Towers called this ``a
macabre comedy of impulsive, thwarted lives'' and said ``Jhabvala
renders a little world of emotional, greedy refugees with much
shrewdness of insight.''
</P>
<P>
   The same publisher has also reissued  &UR; HEAT AND DUST &LR;  ($14), an
earlier novel by Jhabvala that revolves around a restless young
British woman who moves to India with her husband in the 1920s and
quickly goes native, falling under the sway of a charming Indian
prince. In 1976 the reviewer Pearl K. Bell said the author depicts
``the barriers of incomprehension and futility that persist between
English and Indians with witty precision.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JANE AUSTEN: A LIFE &LR;  By Claire Tomalin. Vintage, $14. The
latest take on the British novelist holds that her life was more
exciting, traumatic and adventurous than previous biographies have
allowed. In 1997 the reviewer Kevin Barry said that while the
approach is overly speculative, ``it is Tomalin's overt intention
to present us with a Jane Austen living on the edge of a mobile
world.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GAFF TOPSAILS &LR;  By Patrick Kavanagh. Penguin, $13.95. The ghost
of ``Ulysses'' hovers over this first novel, which traces a day in
the life of several people _ among them a bitter priest and a
dreamy teen-age girl _ who inhabit an Irish Catholic parish on the
coast of Newfoundland in 1948. ``The narrative swoops down, like a
sea gull, on each character,'' Courtney Weaver wrote last year.
``Like Joyce, Kavanagh uses language as a metaphor for the division
of souls and of countries.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FREE LIVE FREE &LR;  By Gene Wolfe. Orb/Tom Doherty, $15.95. This
science-fiction tale centers on a detective, a prostitute, a
salesman and a witch who are lured by a mysterious man to a Chicago
house slated to be demolished. ``The plot ... is full of surprises
that I can't even hint at without ruining the pleasure of discovery
that awaits those who enter the worlds that Wolfe creates,'' Gerald
Jonas wrote in 1985.

ASU'S PARK TO TURN PRO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BY BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TULSA _ Apparently there is no saving Grace for the Arizona
State women's golf program, which had its attempt at a record
seventh NCAA Championship washed away by a thunderstorm on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Grace Park, who capped her brilliant amateur career with
individual honors at the weather-plagued tournament at Tulsa
Country Club, plans to join the professional ranks following her
appearance at the upcoming U.S. Women's Open, ``The Republic'' has
learned.
</P>
<P>
   Park did not want to confirm such an announcement in the
aftermath of the NCAA competition, which left her and teammates in
a state of shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Later,'' said the ASU sophomore, who conceded that her mind
was made up before she added the NCAA crown to the other 54 titles
she has captured in 118 junior/amateur tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I plan to play as an amateur in the Open, and after that, I
have no plans. I will make an announcement sometime this summer.''
</P>
<P>
   But Park's father, Soo Nam Park, a wealthy restaurateur from
Seoul, South Korea, said a plan is in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still Grace's call. She is the one that must make the
final decision,'' Soo Nam Park said. ``But it looks like she'll
(turn professional).
</P>
<P>
   ``At this point, school has become boring for her. She will
probably announce her decision either on Saturday or Sunday at the
U.S. Open.''
</P>
<P>
   Park said his 20-year-old daughter plans to play the Futures
Tour, which is the equivalent of the men's Nike Tour. She would
then attempt to qualify for the LPGA in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is limited to four exemptions each year (by the LPGA),''
Park said. ``Since she already has played in (the Standard Register
PING) and the Dinah Shore, she can only play in two more (LPGA)
events the rest of this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Futures will be challenging and raise her competitive
level. That's really what she needs now. She can't get that in
college.''
</P>
<P>
   Park's appearance at the Open does not count against her because
she is the reigning U.S. Amateur champ, who always is invited to
the national championship. This year's tournament is June 3-6 at
West Point, Miss.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of her advisers, which include ASU Coach Linda
Vollstedt and her instructor, Mike LaBauve, have given the move
their blessing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her game is so good; she's ready,'' Vollstedt said of the
two-time All-American. ``But I can't confirm anything. You'll have
to get that from Grace.''
</P>
<P>
   LaBauve said that he would never advise one of his pupils to
skip the final two years of college.
</P>
<P>
   ``But Grace is ready,'' he said. ``Is college golf piquing her
interest? No.
</P>
<P>
   LaBauve said Park is eager to take her game to the professional
level.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she's hungry for the (LPGA) tour,'' he said. ``Just
like everybody else, I think she wants to see what she can do if
she focuses her life strictly on golf. Right now, it's tough to
juggle school, her social life and her golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Park, who has made the cut in eight of the 12 LPGA tournaments
she has played as an amateur, does have all the components to play
professionally. For instance, she captured the NCAA pre-tournament
long drive championship on Tuesday with a wind-aided blast of 342
yards. But she frequently drives the ball over 300 yards since she
switched to the new PING titanium driver, and her irons also carry
farther than those of her peers.
</P>
<P>
   According to Vollstedt, ``Grace has the best short game I've
ever seen in college golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is saying something, considering Vollstedt has coached 14
LPGA players.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a weakness, it is her putting. But since LaBauve
switched her to the cross-handed style, or ``low hand left,'' as
the pros refer to it, her putting has improved.
</P>
<P>
   According to agent Tim McNulty, the director of player
management for women's golf at Cornerstone Sports in Dallas,
``Grace is the total package.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She is head and shoulder above anyone (in the college ranks)
in terms of marketability,'' McNulty said. ``She's possibly the
best woman to come along in golf in the past 10 years, because
she's photogenic, feminine and has a golf game that is all-world,
especially her length off the tee.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornerstone is not the only agency that has been hovering around
Park this week at the NCAA tournament. International Management
Group's Jay Burton, who represents LPGA superstars Karrie Webb and
Se Ri Pak, has been present, as has Steven SungYong Kil, a South
Korean-based agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``But she doesn't need me,'' said SungYong, who originally
represented Park. ``Grace is totally Americanized, and my strength
is in translation.''
</P>
<P>
   Soo Nam Park said that deciding who will represent his daughter
is the last piece of the puzzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been having discussions with her legal guardian in
Phoenix (Charlie Parker) and our good friend Kerry Graham about
that subject,'' Park said. ``But until we determine who that is,
I'll travel with her this summer when she plays on the Futures.'' &QL;

TALENTED SUN, OR LUCKY SON? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Father and son can be a dangerous combination in
sports. An irresistible temptation and the fastest way to last
place.
</P>
<P>
   For every Scott Layden, there is a Joey Meyer, surfing on
daddy's coattails and riding an athletic franchise into the ground.
</P>
<P>
   For every Andy MacPhail, there is a Bill Bidwill Jr., proof that
management by genetics can be a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   And now the spotlight shines on Bryan Colangelo, a general
manager who must justify the title, prove he is more than just a
last name. A man who must exhibit more than the knack of fleecing
the Dallas Mavericks.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the NBA held its annual fix, er, lottery, and the
Suns couldn't beat the odds. And while the big-market Bulls
suspiciously ended up with the No. 1 pick, treating you to the
sight of Jerry Krause and his bouncing chins, reminding you of the
Patrick Ewing conspiracy theory in 1985, the Suns are left in no
man's land.
</P>
<P>
   There are eight solid choices in a quirky class: Lamar Odom,
once accused of cheating on an entrance exam to UNLV. Steve
Francis, an Allen Iverson clone who has attended six schools in six
years. The talent-laden Corey Maggette, who didn't even start for
Duke last season. A group rounded out by Elton Brand, Wally
Szczerbiak, Richard Hamilton, Baron Davis and Andre Miller.
Naturally, the Suns pick ninth.
</P>
<P>
   So will it be Jonathan Bender, a 6-11 prep star from
Mississippi? A kid that weighs all of 195 pounds?
</P>
<P>
   Or 7-foot-3 Aleksandr Radojevic, who played at a community
college in Kansas?
</P>
<P>
   Or will the Suns hold off on their draft debt to the Bulls, keep
their No. 16 pick and peddle both selections to move up in the
draft?
</P>
<P>
   The options clearly outweigh the saviors.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt, it is a trying time for the younger Colangelo, who has
run hot and cold. His heist of Jason Kidd was visionary. Cliff
Robinson was a bold stroke. George McCloud was a solid acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, the results were a bit different.
</P>
<P>
   The good: The trade of Steve Nash reaped 36 lottery balls and
Pat Garrity.
</P>
<P>
   The debatable: A six-year extension for Rex Chapman. A lengthy,
lucrative contract for Luc Longley. The failed risk of Antonio
McDyess and all those all wasted draft picks.
</P>
<P>
   The unquestioned: The Suns are slow, soft and light-years from
an NBA title.
</P>
<P>
   They also are falling out of favor in the Valley, a team that
couldn't sell out its only home playoff game of 1999. A team that
soon may long for the kind of cult following cheering for the
Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   So it is up to the younger Colangelo to fill in the cracks
before the walls crumble. He has to re-sign Robinson. He has to
find an impact performer with the $2 million exception, and a
strong complementary player with the $1 million exception.
</P>
<P>
   He has to bulk up the interior with size and skill, allowing the
passive Longley to roam the perimeter and turning Tom Gugliotta
into what he always has been: the third option on offense.
</P>
<P>
   And he has zero margin for error.
</P>
<P>
   As much as Danny Ainge has shown a nice touch in the coach's
seat, he did little to help the future of the Suns. Only Garrity's
uncanny self-confidence allowed him to succeed in limited minutes.
And in this desperate search for athleticism, wouldn't it be nice
to know whether Toby Bailey has a future in the NBA?
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to rebuild while focusing on continuity and
meaningless playoff berths. But that is the path the Suns have
chosen, and the burden now facing the younger Colangelo.
</P>
<P>
   Brand could be the physical specimen sorely needed. Maggette is
the kind of athlete who comes around once every decade. Either
would be a celebrated pick, but neither will be available without
serious posturing. Colangelo must decide by Monday whether to hang
on to the No. 16 pick, and even if he does, there is no guarantee
of moving up.
</P>
<P>
   Which is the nature of the business, one dominated by general
mangers with vision. And soon, we'll know whether the younger
Colangelo is the real deal or just another fortunate son. &QL;

DAAL HELPS OUT D-BACKS STAFF IN WIN OVER ROCKIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ With the Diamondbacks ship beginning to take on water
in the pitchers' quarters, left-hander Omar Daal grabbed a large
bucket and bailed them out Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   He gave the relief corps a badly needed day of rest to allow
soreness to dissipate and minds to recuperate. Daal threw a
complete game and scattered 11 hits, only one over the final four
innings, as Arizona ended a three-game losing streak with an 8-3
victory over the Colorado Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   A sellout crowd of 48,594 at Coors Field saw the Diamondbacks
raise their record to 24-20 and remain 1{ games behind San
Francisco in the National League West Division. Colorado fell to
17-22.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona pitchers had given up eight runs in each of the team's
previous three losses. The team lost right-handed starter Todd
Stottlemyre because of a partially torn rotator cuff earlier in the
week, and relievers Gregg Olson (pulled lower abdominal muscle) and
Darren Holmes (stiffness in lower back) were slowed considerably
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody had to tell me about that (relief situation),'' said
Daal, who threw 125 pitches, walked two and struck out two while
evening his record at 4-4.
</P>
<P>
   It was his first complete game of the season and fourth of his
career, and the team's first this season other than the three by
left-hander Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told myself that I was going to have to go as long as I can,
pitch a good game,'' Daal said. ``The last three innings, I was
feeling good. I wanted to try to keep the ball down and get the
groundouts.''
</P>
<P>
   He accomplished his objective.
</P>
<P>
   He got five groundouts in the final three innings, including
double play balls in the eighth and ninth innings.
</P>
<P>
   The second double play ended the game, when Daal had a chance to
field a grounder by pinch-hitter Angel Echevarria but decided to
let it go. Second baseman Jay Bell snared it, stepped on second
base to force Chris Sexton and threw to first to get Echevarria.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has a great field presence,'' said Bell, whose three-run
homer was the highlight of a five-run sixth inning that allowed the
Diamondbacks to take control. ``He knows what to do and what not to
do. It's fun to play behind a pitcher like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Damian Miller said he didn't think Daal had his best
stuff, ``but the way he pitches . . . he's a battler. He mixed up
his pitches and has a good idea of what he wants to do out there. I
love catching him.
</P>
<P>
   ``His fastball wasn't working that well early, but then he got
it up to 87, 88 later in the game and started spotting it.''
</P>
<P>
   Daal's combination plate gave Rockies right fielder Larry Walker
a case of indigestion. Walker was hitless in four at-bats and saw
his hitting streak come to an end at 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Omar had him frustrated, going after balls out of the
strike zone,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Angry was a better description.
</P>
<P>
   Walker has been steamed at Daal since a game at Coors Field last
season when he hit a tapper back to Daal and Daal held the ball,
forcing him to run to first base and throwing him out at the last
minute. Walker tapped the ball back to Daal again Saturday in his
first at-bat to begin a double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shouldn't beat us,'' said Walker, who beat the Diamondbacks
on Friday night with a homer in the bottom of the 11th inning.
``Not here. Not at our house because we're better than him. It's no
hidden secret that he's not a friend of mine. He throws at me all
the time (Daal hit Walker with a pitch in a game at Bank One
Ballpark last Sunday). I don't play those show-me-up games.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado took a 1-0 lead in the first inning on an RBI single by
Dante Bichette. Arizona countered with two in the third on a
leadoff homer by Tony Batista and a single by Luis Gonzalez that
scored Daal, who had singled.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies moved back in front, 3-2, in the fourth on a one-out
solo homer by Vinny Castilla and an RBI single by Sexton.
</P>
<P>
   Three singles off left-hander Bobby Jones, a walk to Batista and
an error by Jones got the Diamondbacks going in the sixth. Bell
greeted right-hander David Lee with a three-run homer, his 14th of
the season. It was Lee's major league debut after being called up
from Double-A on Thursday. &QL;
