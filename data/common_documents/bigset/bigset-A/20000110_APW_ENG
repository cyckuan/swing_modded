    NEW YORK (AP) -- Spending on machine tools in November fell 18 percent from
the previous month and was down 7 percent from the year-ago November, according
to two industry groups.
</P>
<P>
	   Companies spent an estimated $452 million for machine tools in November, the
Association for Manufacturing Technology and the American Machine Tool
Distributors' Association said in a joint statement released Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   That's was a significant decline from a revised $553 million for October and
the $487 million spent in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Through November, machine tool consumption for the year totaled $5.2
billion, down 28 percent from the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
	   "As the machine tool industry concludes one of the weakest sales years of
the decade, it appears U.S. manufacturers will continue their limited investment
in capital equipment," said Ralph J. Nappi, AMTDA president. "Only a slight
increase is forecast for 2000" as metalworking companies have already enhanced
their equipment and productivity and because of smaller demand for manufactured
goods.

	   Analysts consider demand for machine tools a reliable indicator of the
strength of the manufacturing sector and the overall economy.

<HEADLINE> Military Facing Recruiting Troubles  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A report on the nation's military culture says America's
armed forces face formidable challenges in the 21st century, especially
recruiting problems caused by the robust economy and a lack of role models.
</P>
<P>
	   The Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington think tank,
says its two-year study, based on responses from thousands of military men and
women, finds the U.S. military is entering a critical period.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For many of today's youth, enlisting in the military is an alien thought.
With the number of veterans dwindling, local advocates and role models are
fading in number,'' according to the report, which was being released Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   All military branches face tremendous pressures in recruiting and retaining
qualified men and women for today's computerized high-tech warfare, the study
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Opportunities offered by the booming economy and record low unemployment
make it increasingly difficult to fill the ranks of an all-volunteer military
force.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation no longer has an identifiable major military adversary. But at no
comparable period in peacetime history has the United States leaned more heavily
or frequently on its armed forces for such missions as peacekeeping and drug
intervention.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In an era when `peacetime' America has never been safer from military
aggression, ... this volunteer force has never been busier,'' the report says.
``Today the smallest force in four decades -- with 56 percent married -- is
overworked, underpaid and underresourced at the cutting edge.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Cmdr. Terry Sutherland, a Pentagon spokesman, could not comment on the
study because he said he has not seen it. ``We look forward to reading it,''
Sutherland said.
</P>
<P>
	   The report's authors say there is little doubt that conditions within the
armed forces are far less favorable than they were even 10 years ago, and the
U.S. military faces ``potentially serious rifts in its culture.''
</P>
<P>
	   Today's soldiers are older and more often married than in the days when the
ranks were filled with young draftees. Consequently, the study finds, modern
warriors have higher expectations on matters that affect the quality of their
lives and the satisfaction they experience in their jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   Military policy-makers face difficult choices on how best to spend their
budgets on new gear, maintaining bases and facilities, training personnel,
repairing aging equipment, increasing pay and finding money for unforeseen
contingencies.
</P>
<P>
	   The study offers numerous recommendations the authors maintain could help
military leaders better cope with the needs of its recruits.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said the public must be better educated about how military
culture and the demands it makes on soldiers and their families differ from
civilian life.
</P>
<P>
	   It also said the stress level must be reduced by either increasing the
military's resources or reducing or redesigning the services' missions.

<HEADLINE> SuperSonics 100, Warriors 95 (OT)  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Rashard Lewis hit a go-ahead 3-pointer in overtime
as the Seattle SuperSonics beat the Golden State Warriors 100-95 Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Vin Baker's 30 points and 18 rebounds led the Sonics, who beat Golden State
for the third time in three meetings this season. It was the Warriors' ninth
straight loss, including all six since Garry St. Jean replaced the fired P.J.
Carlesimo as coach.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis finished with 19 points and Brent Barry added 17. Gary Payton had 14,
ending a string of 15 straight games in which the Seattle guard scored at least
20 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Mookie Blaylock and Antawn Jamison each scored 20 for Golden State, which
led 95-93 after Donyell Marshall hit a 15-foot jumper. Lewis came back to hit a
3-pointer to put the Sonics back in front. Seattle hung on as the Warriors
missed their final three shots and turned the ball over in their final
possession without getting a shot off.
</P>
<P>
	   Golden State was trailing 91-88 when Sam Mack, despite being harried by
Payton, made a 3-pointer with 11.5 seconds left in regulation. Payton missed a
long jumper at the buzzer, sending the game into overtime.
</P>
<P>
	   The Warriors stayed in the game despite going without a field goal for a
9:36 stretch, getting six points on free throws in that span. Jamison's driving
layup with 6:32 left ended the drought and pulled Golden State to 81-76.
</P>
<P>
	   Baker and Caffey each made a pair of free throws before Payton drained a
3-pointer, putting Seattle in front 86-78 with 5:44 left.
</P>
<P>
	   Then, the Sonics had a hard time scoring while the Warriors ran off eight
straight points, forging an 86-all tie when Blaylock made one of two free throws
with 2:20 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Mack and Barry missed long jumpers before Barry connected on a
3-pointer with 55 seconds left to break the deadlock. Caffey put back his own
miss to narrow the deficit to 89-88, but Lewis answered by driving into the lane
for a dunk with 30 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   Down by one at the break, the Sonics outscored the Warriors 10-2 over final
3:50 of the third period to take a 72-71 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Baker hit a jumper to start the flurry and Lewis had successive layups to
finish it and put the Sonics in front heading into the final period.
</P>
<P>
	   Golden State took a 49-38 lead on Jamison's 6-foot running jumper with 4:53
remaining in the second quarter before the put together a 14-4 run, pulling to
53-52 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   Baker had 13 points in the period, including seven in the Sonics' surge.

Israel To Sign Peace Treaty With Palestinians
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- An official close to Prime Minister Ehud Barak on Sunday
promised jittery Palestinians that Israel will sign a framework agreement for a
final peace treaty with them before concluding talks with Syria. Israel's chief
negotiator offered Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat similar assurances, trying
to assuage Palestinian concerns that Israel would favor talks with Syria, which
started last month. The affirmations came as negotiations between Barak and
Syria's foreign minister in a U.S.-mediated peace summit in Shepherdstown, W.

20-minute televised address to the nation, President Jamil Mahuad also said that
his 15-member Cabinet had tendered its resignation and that he would name
replacements for the ministers in the coming days. A deal had been hammered out
with Congress to pave the way for approval of several economic reforms, he said,
including "the modernization of the state" -- a term interpreted by many to mean

<HEADLINE> Governor's budget to include most extensive debt reform proposal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - With New York facing both the highest-in-the-nation
debt and credit ratings at the bottom of Wall Street's heap, the state must
attack its debt problem, Gov. George Pataki says.
<P>
	   Pataki's 2000-01 budget presentation to the Legislature this Tuesday will
call for the end to all "back-door" borrowing - the bonding not approved
beforehand by voters, the imposition of caps on debt growth and debt service
costs and a prohibition against debt being used to finance non-capital projects.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor said the state has made "tremendous progress" in restoring some
responsibility to its debt practices since he took over in 1995. But Pataki
declared Sunday, "We can do even more."
</P>
<P>
	   The Pataki plan joins those anti-debt proposals put forward in the past year
or so by the other key players in Albany: the Republican majority in the Senate,
the Democratic majority in the Assembly and state Comptroller H. Carl McCall.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican governor's proposal is probably most similar to the
Democratic comptroller's, Pataki spokesman Michael McKeon said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   "We think this is the year when we can get bipartisan agreement on this
issue," McKeon said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCall on Sunday said it was about time that Pataki makes a serious
commitment to hack away at the state's borrowing practices, though, in truth,
Pataki has been talking about ways to approach the problem for years.
</P>
<P>
	   "We may finally see some progress toward reform," McCall said. "I'm anxious
to work together with the governor and Legislature to finally see some progress
toward reform."
</P>
<P>
	   Wall Street has long looked askance at the state's loose borrowing practices
under which New York has accumulated a nation's-high $37.5 billion in debt. It
is one of the factors that continues to prevent the state from improving its
credit rating when it seeks to borrow money, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts were especially critical of such Cuomo-era moves as the state's
"sale" of Attica state prison to itself, calling them nothing more than gimmicks
that are highly damaging to the state's fiscal integrity.
</P>
<P>
	   Said McCall on Sunday, "New York has borrowed the wrong way for the wrong
reasons" for many years.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki said he would also ask legislators when unveiling his budget on
Tuesday to boost the state's Debt Reduction Reserve Fund from $250 million to
$750 million. That fund, created in 1996, has been used to shift the funding of
some projects from bonds to a pay-as-you-go approach.
</P>
<P>
	   That, in turn, saves taxpayers' money by avoiding long-term financing costs
on bonds.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor said he'd ask to use $500 million in fiscal 2000-01 to reduce
debt and the other $250 million in the following fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki will fund that increase in part by applying leftover money due the
state through its settlement with tobacco companies to the debt reserve fund,
McKeon said. At first, Pataki said he'd like to put the entire settlement money
toward debt reduction, but agreed last month with the Legislature to use the
bulk of it - roughly $1 billion between now and 2003 - to fund health coverage
programs for the uninsured.
</P>
<P>
	   Roughly $250 million would be left over for debt-reduction purposes, state
officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki said he would propose capping new debt at 3.5 percent of personal
income in the state - the current level is about 6 percent - and cap new debt
service costs.
</P>
<P>
	   Some of the debt-practice changes can be done legislatively. Others have to
be approved by voters by amending the state constitution.

<HEADLINE> Virginia Set To Execute Three  </HEADLINE>
   By BILL BASKERVILL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Douglas Christopher Thomas was 17 when he used a
12-gauge shotgun to kill his girlfriend's parents because they tried to keep the
young couple apart.
</P>
<P>
	   Jessica Wiseman, the 14-year-old girlfriend who urged Thomas to act, was too
young to be tried as an adult but was convicted of the 1990 murders as a
juvenile. She was sentened to a juvenile prison, the maximum penalty, until age
21. She was released in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas is scheduled to receive a lethal injection tonight at the Greensville
Correctional Center in Jarratt. The way Thomas sees it, life is unfair.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What I did when I was 17 was wrong, and yes I should be punished,'' said
Thomas in a telephone interview from the Sussex I State Prison near Waverly.
``But to pay the ultimate price while my co-defendant, who is just as guilty as
I am, has been released to go on with a normal life ... is a little extreme.''
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1976, when the U.S. Supreme Court reinstituted the death penalty after
a decade hiatus, 13 people who committed crimes as juveniles were executed out
of a total of 598 state-sanctioned killings. Seventy-four of those who committed
crimes as juveniles remain on the nation's death rows.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States is virtually alone in the world in executing people who
committed crimes as juveniles. Only Iran, Nigeria, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and
Yemen executed people in the 1990s for crimes they committed as juveniles,
according to the American Bar Association.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're so out of step with the rest of the world,'' said Wally Mlyniec,
associate dean of the Georgetown University Law Center and chairman of the ABA's
juvenile justice committee.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We still believe that people under 18 are children and don't commit acts
of any sort for the same reason that adults do,'' said Mlyniec.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas, 26, fatally shot James Baxter Wiseman and his wife, Kathy, as they
slept in their home 11 days before Thanksgiving 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to Thomas, Steve Edward Roach, 23, who shot a woman to death and
stole her car in 1993 when he was 17, is scheduled for execution in Virginia
Thursday. Texas has set Jan. 25 for the execution of Glen McGinnis, 26, who
killed a woman during a robbery in 1992 when he, too, was 17.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas has asked Gov. Jim Gilmore to commute his sentence to life in prison
without parole. Roach has dropped his court appeals, but has a clemency petition
before the governor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I put all my trust in God,'' he said. ``I am ready to accept whatever
happens and I am praying for a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly 360 people have been executed for juvenile crimes in America, the
first in 1642 at Plymouth Colony in Massachusetts. The number comprises 1.8
percent of the roughly 19,200 executions in America since 1608, according to
Victor L. Streib, dean of law at Ohio Northern University and an expert on
juvenile justice.
</P>
<P>
	   Virginia, second behind Texas in executions, is not swayed by international
standards on executing juveniles who commit capital crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The U.S. Supreme Court has held that someone 17 years of age can be
executed for committing capital murder,'' said David Botkins, spokesman for
Attorney General Mark Earley. ``What's important to note is in Virginia,
independently elected commonwealth's attorneys prosecute these cases and have to
decide what sentence to seek based on facts of the case.''
</P>
<P>
	   The United States in 1977 signed the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights that, among other things, prohibits executing juveniles. But
the Senate, in ratifying the covenant, refused to agree to the ban on executing
17-year-olds or those who committed capital crimes as juveniles.

<HEADLINE> NBC Exec: Game Shows Not the Cure  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Maybe it's a warning, maybe it's just jealousy. But
a top NBC executive used a colorful analogy to explain why his rivals at ABC may
eventually regret "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire."
</P>
<P>
	   "It's like crack," Garth Ancier, NBC entertainment president, said Sunday.
"Once you're on it, it's wonderful because you get these giant ratings. But
nobody believes it's going to work forever."
</P>
<P>
	   "Millionaire," returned to ABC Sunday for eight consecutive nights in
prime-time before settling down to air regularly, three nights a week. NBC,
meanwhile, continued the quiz show craze Sunday be reviving the 1950s game show,
"21."
</P>
<P>
	   Ancier said he watches "Millionaire" and enjoys it, and calls its success
one of the most significant developments in television in several years.
</P>
<P>
	   But he and his colleague, NBC West Coast President Scott Sassa, both noted
that ABC has set comedies and dramas aside to make room for "Millionaire." In
the long term, they believe ABC will pay for its preoccupation with the game
show.
</P>
<P>
	   "When this thing ends, you're going to have a heck of a lot of development
to do," Sassa said. "That's going to be a tough duty."
</P>
<P>
	   Ancier compared it to Fox and the attention that network gave to colorful
reality shows over the past two years. Now the reality genre has cooled and Fox,
which struck out with its new fall shows, is struggling.
</P>
<P>
	   ABC is currently in third place in the ratings, following CBS and NBC. But
with ABC airing the Super Bowl and Academy Awards, plus a steady diet of
"Millionaire," it has a shot at scoring a lucrative upset win for the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Messages left Sunday for two ABC spokesmen and the publicist for
"Millionaire" were not immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
	   Veteran television executive Fred Silverman, who is producing "21" for NBC,
said the success of "Millionaire" was the audience's way of telling the people
who run the networks they wanted something different.
</P>
<P>
	   "In the last five or 10 years, we've gone overboard with a diet of half-hour
comedies," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The new "21" is similar to the original, but it makes one big concession for
the times: Its questions are multiple choice, not open-ended, and are far easier
than those posed to contestants in the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
	   NBC is hoping to set another trend in the fall. Its executives said about
half of the comedies NBC has in development are geared to a family audience
since the end of "Home Improvement" left a void in that genre. One promising
show, "Daddio," will star Michael Chiklis as a stay-at-home dad.
</P>
<P>
	   "The alternative to doing family shows is to have really attractive people
living in lofts in New York," Sassa said, "which we've done."

<HEADLINE> Stuart, Mickey Reign at Box Office  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The mouse invasion continues at movie theaters.
</P>
<P>
	   "Stuart Little," with Michael J. Fox providing the voice of E.B. White's
amiable rodent, was the No. 1 movie for the second straight weekend, grossing
$11.5 million, according to industry estimates Sunday. The movie has taken in
$95.6 million in four weeks and should pass the $100 million mark by next
weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   "Fantasia/2000," featuring Mickey Mouse, did elephantine business in a
limited run at Imax theaters, playing to sold-out houses in many places.
</P>
<P>
	   And the prison saga "The Green Mile," which co-stars a Death Row inmate's
pet mouse, remained strong as the No. 3 movie with $9.7 million, pushing its
total gross to $91.3 million in five weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   With no new movies out this weekend, holdovers rounded out the top 10. "The
Talented Mr. Ripley" was second with $9.8 million, "Any Given Sunday" was fourth
with $9 million, and "Galaxy Quest" was fifth with $8.3 million.
</P>
<P>
	   "Fantasia/2000," Disney's update of the 1940 animated classic, took in $2.7
million this weekend in 54 Imax theaters in the United States and Canada. The
film had a phenomenal per-theater average of $50,000, compared with $3,860 for
"Stuart Little," playing on 2,979 screens.
</P>
<P>
	   "Fantasia/2000" also played at 21 Imax theaters overseas but Disney did not
have the weekend results yet. Overall, it has grossed at least $8.5 million
worldwide since opening on New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
	   Like its predecessor, "Fantasia/2000" features short segments set to
classical music and includes the Mickey Mouse episode, "The Sorcerer's
Apprentice," from the original film.
</P>
<P>
	   The movie has a four-month run at Imax theaters before hitting regular
cinemas this summer. Disney chose Imax, with its huge screens and superior sound
systems, to give "Fantasia/2000" more of an event status.
</P>
<P>
	   The late Walt Disney had conceived of "Fantasia" as a work in progress, with
periodic updates planned. But the original was received coolly by critics and
did not break even financially until a re-release in the late 1950s.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think he would be so happy that his dream has been fulfilled now both
artistically and commercially," said Chuck Viane, head of distribution for
Disney.
</P>
<P>
	   Two movies that expanded to wider theatrical runs cracked the top 10.
"Magnolia," from director Paul Thomas Anderson, was No. 7 with $6.6 million in
1,034 theaters, up from nine theaters the previous weekend. The movie averaged
$6,359 per screen, impressive considering its three-hour length.
</P>
<P>
	   An ensemble film interweaving multiple plots on a single day, "Magnolia" has
received generally positive reviews, particularly for Tom Cruise as a TV guru
who teaches men to "seduce and destroy" women.
</P>
<P>
	   "Snow Falling on Cedars," adapted from the best-selling novel, was No. 10
with $4 million after expanding to 1,150 theaters, up from three last weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   "Toy Story 2" had $7.5 million for a total of $220.1 million, passing
"Aladdin's" $217 million. It is now Disney's third-biggest movie ever, behind
"The Lion King" at $312 million and "The Sixth Sense" at $276 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North American theaters,
according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final figures were to be released
today.
</P>
<P>
	   1. "Stuart Little," $11.5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   2. "The Talented Mr. Ripley," $9.8 million.
</P>
<P>
	   3. "The Green Mile," $9.7 million.
</P>
<P>
	   4. "Any Given Sunday," $9 million.
</P>
<P>
	   5. "Galaxy Quest," $8.3 million.
</P>
<P>
	   6. "Toy Story 2," $7.5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   7. "Magnolia," $6.6 million.
</P>
<P>
	   8. "Bicentennial Man," $5.2 million.
</P>
<P>
	   9. "Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo," $5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   10. "Snow Falling on Cedars," $4 million.

<HEADLINE> Option for War Ruled Out for Syria  </HEADLINE>
   By ZEINA KARAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) -- There was a time not too long ago when Syria
believed war was the best, and perhaps only, way to win back the Golan Heights
it lost to Israel 33 years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   But over the years, Syria -- which has fought three wars against the Jewish
state, the last in 1973 -- has gradually dismissed the military option in its
confrontation. It has opted instead for negotiations as a means to recover its
territory.
</P>
<P>
	   Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak have been meeting during the past week in Shepherdstown, W. Va., their
second round of talks after an icebreaking session in Washington last month.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, the U.S.-brokered negotiations have made little headway,
underscoring the long-standing tension between the two nations. The talks
appeared to be winding down today without even a tentative agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   The collapse of the Soviet Union, Syria's traditional political backer, and
peace treaties between Israel and Arab countries who were once Syria's partners
in war are among a handful of other reasons that forced leaders to resort to
peace talks with their bitterest foe.
</P>
<P>
	   There has been a gradual transformation in Syria's political rhetoric, said
Imad Shuaibi, a Syrian journalist and political analyst.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The focus has slowly shifted from the conflict over Israel's right to
exist to a border conflict,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But Syrians have other ways of going to war.'' He cited the ongoing
conflict between Israeli occupation troops in southern Lebanon and Shiite Muslim
guerrillas seeking to drive them out. Iran and Syria, the main power broker in
Lebanon, both support the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Syria realizes it cannot recover the Golan through direct military
pressure now'' but it uses the conflict in southern Lebanon to exert indirect
pressure, Shuaibi said.
</P>
<P>
	   In November, a senior Syrian official admitted as much.
</P>
<P>
	   In a rare acknowledgment, Parliament Speaker Abdul-Kader Kaddoura said Arab
nations were incapable of regaining through war territory occupied by the Jewish
state since the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I say it frankly that we are not capable of liberation -- not only Syria,
but also all the Arabs,'' he told foreign journalists.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts say President Hafez Assad, who was Syria's defense minister when
Syria lost the Golan Heights in 1967, has always been behind the concept of
military parity with Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   Indeed, during the 1973 Mideast War, Syrian troops who took Israel by
surprise managed to regain a sizable chunk of the strategic territory.
</P>
<P>
	   Since he seized power in a bloodless coup in 1970, Assad has dreamed of
recovering the entire Golan Heights, driving the Israelis into the sea and
uniting the Arab world with Syria at its head.
</P>
<P>
	   That dream began fading with Egypt's peace treaty with Israel in 1979. Egypt
had fought alongside Syria in the 1948, 1967 and 1973 Arab-Israeli wars.
</P>
<P>
	   Assad felt largely abandoned with the 1991 fall of his former patron and
main arms provider, the Soviet Union, and peace accords between Israel and the
Palestinians in 1990 and Jordan in 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Arabs in general seem to have given up on the military option,'' said
Ghassan Beshara, editor of the New York-based Middle East Report.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Add to all that Syria's troubled economy and the fact that Syrian weaponry
is quite old and outdated, and you find that all these factors crystallized into
a new Syrian mode of thinking leading up to political negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some Syrians, though, cling to old rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If we are not able to secure our rights through negotiations, we are ready
to use force because this land must be returned someday, one way or another,''
said Abboud Sarraj, dean of the law faculty at Damascus University. ``It is our
legitimate, undeniable right.''

<HEADLINE> Female Fighters Used in Sri Lanka  </HEADLINE>
   By DILIP GANGULY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- Huddling under rice straw and dry leaves on his
verandah, 70-year-old Rankothabendi Peter watched in silent terror as scores of
women waving machetes and assault guns descended on his village out of the
night.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 90 minutes before daybreak, 100 Tamil guerrillas -- most of them
women -- hacked, slashed and shot to death 48 Sinhalese villagers as they slept
or tried to flee through surrounding rice fields. Among the carnage were the
dismembered bodies of 11 children.
</P>
<P>
	   Peter survived the slaughter at Borapola, 125 miles west of Sri Lanka's
capital, Colombo, only because the marauders never found his hiding place.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sept. 18 attack was carried out by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam,
a rebel group known for the high number of fiercely committed women, many
recruited as children, who fight alongside the men.
</P>
<P>
	   Tamil rebels have been fighting for a separate homeland on this island off
India's southeast coast since 1983, accusing the majority Sinhalese of
widespread discrimination in education and jobs. The Sinhalese, who control the
government and military, comprise 76 percent of Sri Lanka's 18.6 million people.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sri Lankan Defense Ministry says a female member of an elite suicide
squad known as the Black Tigers blew herself up last week, killing 12 other
people outside the office of Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike. When guards
closed in, suspicious because the woman had a Sinhalese identity card but could
not speak the language, she ignited explosives strapped beneath her clothing.
</P>
<P>
	   On Dec. 18, another woman blew herself up at an election rally for President
Chandrika Kumaratunga. That blast killed 23 people and wounded the president,
who may lose sight in her right eye as a result of the explosion.
</P>
<P>
	   Tamil Tiger leader Velupillai Prabhakaran, who founded the rebel group in
1976 as a high school dropout, described the suicide bombers as ``the
self-protective armor of our race,'' last July when marking the Black Tigers'
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
	   From a ragtag band of fighters who attacked a group of soldiers in 1983, the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam have developed into a sophisticated force
banned in Sri Lanka, India and the United States. They have Web sites and use
satellite phones to transmit daily battlefield reports to offices in London and
Paris, where supporters raise funds and handle public relations.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sri Lankan military believes half the Tigers' estimated fighting force
of 5,000 are women. These ``Birds of Freedom,'' as their fellow rebels call
them, have carried out the highest profile attacks -- the assassination of
Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991 and the two recent bombings in
Colombo.
</P>
<P>
	   While Sri Lankan women are much more likely to work outside the home than
those in other South Asian countries, most Tamil women maintain traditional
appearance -- richly colored saris, brilliant jewelry, flowers in their flowing
hair, silver anklets and red dots on their foreheads.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebel women, however, ``are in combat fatigues, in boots, with no
makeup, jewelry or ostentation, often with their hair cut in short, male style,
wearing a cyanide capsule around their necks,'' says Radhika Coomaraswamy, a
Tamil academic who studies violence against women for the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
	   The new image ``puts forward androgyny as ideal,'' she said. ``Both men and
women are aspiring for the same thing with an identity and style.''
</P>
<P>
	   Children, male and female, are chosen as young as 10 to become suicide
bombers. Some families willingly allow their children to join the rebel cause,
perhaps not realizing their intended tasks. But a few young rebels captured in
battle say they were snatched on their way home from school or errands.
</P>
<P>
	   All receive combat training, and the girls are told stories of glory from
Hindu epics about women who battled enemies of the Tamil people.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They first use the girls as spies and constantly tell them they are doing
a great service for the homeland cause,'' said retiring Gen. Sarath Munasinghe,
who until three weeks ago was military commander in the Tamil city of Jaffna,
where he interrogated captured rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The attention they get makes their tender hearts feel very good, and then
the indoctrination starts,'' he said, adding that the female fighters are
generally kept in a confined area and are not allowed to meet outsiders. ``They
are shown video films and are constantly fed with stories of how Tamils are
oppressed and killed.''
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels deliberately choose women as suicide bombers, Munasinghe said,
because women may not undergo as close a body search as men at checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
	   Cultural expectations of women may also be a factor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In our society, women sacrifice a lot. You can't see it because most women
suffer silently,'' says Maheswary Velautham, a Tamil lawyer who handles human
rights cases. ``In a normal home, the sacrifice may look simple, like eating
last so others in the family don't go hungry. It is this element of sacrifice
that manifests one million times stronger when a woman militant is asked to die
for the cause of the Tamil homeland.''

<HEADLINE> Accuser's grandma supports Jovanovic in cybersex case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - Oliver Jovanovic, who was freed from prison after his
conviction in a kidnapping and sex torture case was overturned, is getting moral
support from his accuser's relatives.
<P>
	   The accuser's grandmother, who identified herself as Fay Webster, hugged
Jovanovic and his family at a press conference Sunday and cast doubt on her
granddaughter's credibility.
</P>
<P>
	   "She caused a lot of trouble in a lot of people's lives by her lying," Ms.
Webster said of her granddaughter. "It's a very sad case. ... There have just
been other incidents that happened."
</P>
<P>
	   She added: "I felt bad for Oliver because he didn't need to go through
this."
</P>
<P>
	   Jovanovic, 32, said the charges against him were fabricated.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a hoax," he said. "My accuser's family saw right through them."
</P>
<P>
	   Jovanovic's brother, Adrian Jovanovic, said the accuser "has a history of
making false allegations."
</P>
<P>
	   Neither Ms. Webster nor anyone else at the press conference would elaborate,
but they referred to a column in the New York Post that said the accuser "stole
from her father on a constant basis and once falsely accused her father and
uncle of sexually molesting her at the age of 17."
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Webster's son is the accuser's father. She lives in a small town near
Buffalo, where the accuser, a college student at the time of the alleged attack,
grew up.
</P>
<P>
	   The accuser's mother appeared to fully support her daughter during the
trial, testifying that she had notified campus police of Jovanovic's alleged
attack over the young woman's objections.
</P>
<P>
	   The accuser admitted at trial that she had used her father's credit cards
and personal checks without his permission.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokeswoman for the Manhattan district attorney's office, Barbara
Thompson, had no comment Sunday. The accuser could not be reached for comment as
she does not have a lawyer or a listed telephone number.
</P>
<P>
	   Laurie Poole, an aunt of the accuser, also appeared at the press conference
in support of Jovanovic and Ms. Webster, but she did not speak.
</P>
<P>
	   Jovanovic's girlfriend, Marinza Bruineman, attested to her belief in his
innocence.
</P>
<P>
	   "As a woman who has slept nightly with this man ... there is nothing vile,
weird or evil about him," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Webster said she had not been in contact with her granddaughter for
several years.
</P>
<P>
	   "We didn't have a good relationship," she acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
	   Jovanovic was two weeks away from defending his doctoral dissertation at
Columbia University in molecular biology when he was arrested in 1996. He was
convicted in 1998 on charges of kidnapping, sex abuse and assault, but the
conviction was overturned last month and he was freed from prison after serving
20 months.
</P>
<P>
	   The Appellate Division overturned the conviction on the grounds that the
jury should have been allowed to see e-mails sent by the accuser to Jovanovic in
which she expressed an interest in sadomasochism.
</P>
<P>
	   During trial, his lawyers asserted that everything that went on between them
was consensual.
</P>
<P>
	   Jovanovic met his accuser, a Barnard College sophomore, in an Internet chat
room. She told authorities he then lured her to his Washington Heights
apartment, tied her up and tortured her for 20 hours, biting her, beating her
and dripping hot candle wax on her body.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Syrian Talks Near an End  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- President Clinton renewed his efforts to push
Israeli and Syrian negotiators toward a land-for-peace treaty with a series of
meetings Sunday evening, but the talks appeared to be winding down without even
a tentative agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Clearly we are coming to the end of the leaders' participation here this
week,'' the State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a post-midnight session with reporters, Rubin said he did not expect an
agreement to emerge and that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa were likely to meet again ``sooner rather than
later.''
</P>
<P>
	   An administration official said, meanwhile, Clinton was unlikely to return
to the negotiations on Monday. ``At the leader level this round is pretty much
concluded,'' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   That left open the possibility Barak and al-Sharaa would leave experts
behind to try to keep whittling away at the issues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We think there have been a lot of positive developments,'' Rubin said
after Clinton met for 2 1/2 hours with Barak and al-Sharaa and then separately
with each of them.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israeli foreign minister, David Levy, left for Morocco and a meeting
there with King Mohamed VI.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak, describing the weeklong talks over territory, peace terms, water and
security as complex and difficult, was making plans to depart for home Monday
and diplomatic sources said al-Sharaa was likely to follow on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   On the sensitive issue of establishing a new border, once Israel pulls back
on the Golan Heights, Levy said before departing that ``nothing has been agreed
upon.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, who had intervened in the negotiations four times before Sunday,
returned to the site of the talks after nightfall Sunday. ``He's going for
meetings,'' a White House official said. ``The process continues.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is an ongoing process,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
``The issues are difficult and complex.''
</P>
<P>
	   A source close to the Syrian delegation said the focus of the working dinner
would be the seven-page document, which is a summary of points of accord and
discord, that Clinton presented to both leaders on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Syrians have made
revisions to the document that they would bring up during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   The source stressed that the Israelis had to accept Syria's border terms,
adding that Damascus would not make compromises on that issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, Barak and al-Sharaa all were dressed casually as waiters served
tenderloin of beef with morel sauce, along with chardonnay and merlot wines.
</P>
<P>
	   Committees met Sunday on all the key issues, and the State Department
spokesman James P. Rubin said the two sides responded positively to the
statement presented Friday by the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The document could become the basis for an eventual ``core agreement,''
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   But he said Israel and Syria still faced ``enormous decisions'' and ``we
don't expect those decisions to be made in a matter of days,''
</P>
<P>
	   American mediators had not offered ``bridging proposals'' designed to close
the gap where the two sides were in disagreement, Rubin added.
</P>
<P>
	   In Jerusalem, Israel Cabinet Minister Haim Ramon said Syria had refused to
permit Israel to retain an early warning station on the Golan Heights once it is
relinquished.
</P>
<P>
	   But, Ramon said, Syria was prepared to consider a station manned mostly by
American and French personnel, with a Syrian presence and a symbolic Israeli
presence.
</P>
<P>
	   Yielding the plateau would strip Israel of a capability to watch any Syrian
military preparations, including tanks rolling down toward the border.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak and al-Sharaa could leave behind experts to continue deliberations.
But Rubin said there was no decision on how negotiations would proceed, although
he said the United States wanted full-blown negotiations to reconvene ``sooner
rather than later.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no doubt that the negotiation is difficult,'' Barak told Israeli
reporters while touring the Antietam National Battlefield, a Civil War site in
Sharpsburg, Md., with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
	   In his first public remarks since the talks began Jan. 3, Barak said ``the
negotiation is very complex.''
</P>
<P>
	   The prime minister, speaking Hebrew, also gave assurances to the Israeli
public that ``we will not sign an agreement unless, in our opinion, it will
strengthen the security of Israel and address its vital needs.''
</P>
<P>
	   Israel is contemplating a withdrawal from the Golan Heights, a border
highground with a commanding view of Syria, in exchange for a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak, his wife, Nava, and Levy were shown a 26-minute documentary film
recreating the Antietam battle in which North and South suffered 22,726
casualties on Sept. 17, 1862.
</P>
<P>
	   They also listened to a lecture about the bloody day from a National Park
Service ranger and Bruce Reidel, who is on the Near East desk at the National
Security Council and a Civil War buff.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright then hosted a luncheon for Barak at Hillsboro, her Virginia retreat
across the border from West Virginia, and returned to the secluded negotiations
site just outside Shepherdstown to meet with al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Sunday, Al-Hayat, a Saudi newspaper published in London, said Israel
had agreed to pull back to the 1923 border with Syria and that Syria was
insisting on a deeper pullback, to the border that existed at the eve of the
1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said the account was not credible. He told reporters the newspaper's
report differed in ``substantive ways'' from the document prepared at Albright's
direction and presented by Clinton to Barak and al-Sharaa on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   In Syria, the state-run Al-Thawra newspaper, said Sunday that the West
Virginia peace talks are ``in serious danger.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is clear that there are Israeli directives to ... break up the talks in
an attempt to add hurdles and hamper them to leave the political process
spinning in place,'' the newspaper said in an editorial.

<HEADLINE> Female Fighters Used in Sri Lanka  </HEADLINE>
   By DILIP GANGULY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) -- Huddling under rice straw and dry leaves on his
verandah, 70-year-old Rankothabendi Peter watched in silent terror as scores of
women waving machetes and assault guns descended on his village out of the
night.
</P>
<P>
	   In the 90 minutes before daybreak, 100 Tamil guerrillas -- most of them
women -- hacked, slashed and shot to death 48 Sinhalese villagers as they slept
or tried to flee through surrounding rice fields. Among the carnage were the
dismembered bodies of 11 children.
</P>
<P>
	   Peter survived the slaughter at Borapola, 125 miles west of Sri Lanka's
capital, Colombo, only because the marauders never found his hiding place.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sept. 18 attack was carried out by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam,
a rebel group known for the high number of fiercely committed women, many
recruited as children, who fight alongside the men.
</P>
<P>
	   Tamil rebels have been fighting for a separate homeland on this island off
India's southeast coast since 1983, accusing the majority Sinhalese of
widespread discrimination in education and jobs. The Sinhalese, who control the
government and military, comprise 76 percent of Sri Lanka's 18.6 million people.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sri Lankan Defense Ministry says a female member of an elite suicide
squad known as the Black Tigers blew herself up last week, killing 12 other
people outside the office of Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike. When guards
closed in, suspicious because the woman had a Sinhalese identity card but could
not speak the language, she ignited explosives strapped beneath her clothing.
</P>
<P>
	   On Dec. 18, another woman blew herself up at an election rally for President
Chandrika Kumaratunga. That blast killed 23 people and wounded the president,
who may lose sight in her right eye as a result of the explosion.
</P>
<P>
	   Tamil Tiger leader Velupillai Prabhakaran, who founded the rebel group in
1976 as a high school dropout, described the suicide bombers as ``the
self-protective armor of our race,'' last July when marking the Black Tigers'
anniversary.
</P>
<P>
	   From a ragtag band of fighters who attacked a group of soldiers in 1983, the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam have developed into a sophisticated force
banned in Sri Lanka, India and the United States. They have Web sites and use
satellite phones to transmit daily battlefield reports to offices in London and
Paris, where supporters raise funds and handle public relations.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sri Lankan military believes half the Tigers' estimated fighting force
of 5,000 are women. These ``Birds of Freedom,'' as their fellow rebels call
them, have carried out the highest profile attacks -- the assassination of
Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991 and the two recent bombings in
Colombo.
</P>
<P>
	   While Sri Lankan women are much more likely to work outside the home than
those in other South Asian countries, most Tamil women maintain traditional
appearance -- richly colored saris, brilliant jewelry, flowers in their flowing
hair, silver anklets and red dots on their foreheads.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebel women, however, ``are in combat fatigues, in boots, with no
makeup, jewelry or ostentation, often with their hair cut in short, male style,
wearing a cyanide capsule around their necks,'' says Radhika Coomaraswamy, a
Tamil academic who studies violence against women for the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
	   The new image ``puts forward androgyny as ideal,'' she said. ``Both men and
women are aspiring for the same thing with an identity and style.''
</P>
<P>
	   Children, male and female, are chosen as young as 10 to become suicide
bombers. Some families willingly allow their children to join the rebel cause,
perhaps not realizing their intended tasks. But a few young rebels captured in
battle say they were snatched on their way home from school or errands.
</P>
<P>
	   All receive combat training, and the girls are told stories of glory from
Hindu epics about women who battled enemies of the Tamil people.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They first use the girls as spies and constantly tell them they are doing
a great service for the homeland cause,'' said retiring Gen. Sarath Munasinghe,
who until three weeks ago was military commander in the Tamil city of Jaffna,
where he interrogated captured rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The attention they get makes their tender hearts feel very good, and then
the indoctrination starts,'' he said, adding that the female fighters are
generally kept in a confined area and are not allowed to meet outsiders. ``They
are shown video films and are constantly fed with stories of how Tamils are
oppressed and killed.''
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels deliberately choose women as suicide bombers, Munasinghe said,
because women may not undergo as close a body search as men at checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
	   Cultural expectations of women may also be a factor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In our society, women sacrifice a lot. You can't see it because most women
suffer silently,'' says Maheswary Velautham, a Tamil lawyer who handles human
rights cases. ``In a normal home, the sacrifice may look simple, like eating
last so others in the family don't go hungry. It is this element of sacrifice
that manifests one million times stronger when a woman militant is asked to die
for the cause of the Tamil homeland.''

<HEADLINE> Grandparents' Visiting Rights  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID CRARY AP National Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Julie Mehring, mother of a 7-year-old girl, is in jail for
her beliefs. Not over politics or religion; she refuses to accept that an
Illinois court could order visits between grandparents and grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
	   Her jail term is unusual, but not her passion. Wrenching disputes over
grandparent visitation rights have become commonplace in courtrooms nationwide,
often leaving scars on three generations of a family.
</P>
<P>
	   This week, the U.S. Supreme Court tackles the issue for the first time,
hearing an appeal of a ruling that struck down Washington state's visitation
law. The high court's eventual decision could have broad impact, since every
state has enacted laws detailing how grandparents can visit grandchildren over
parental objections.
</P>
<P>
	   It is an issue that has bedeviled legislatures and forced state courts to
make Solomon-like judgments. On one hand, parents have a fundamental right to
raise their children without state intrusion; on the other hand, legislators
empathize with grandparents yearning to preserve ties with their children's
children.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to be able to take my grandchildren to the zoo or the park. I want
them to be able to get to know me,'' says Patricia Militello of Southgate, Mich.
</P>
<P>
	   She and her husband are fighting in court to retain the right to once-a-week
visits with the two children of their daughter, Tamara, who died two years ago.
Tamara's husband has since remarried and no longer wants his 2-year-old son and
4-year-old daughter to see their maternal grandparents.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's such a difficult issue, but we love those kids so much,'' says Mrs.
Militello. ``It just breaks my heart to have any kind of problem with this.''
</P>
<P>
	   In southern Illinois, grandmother Ella Mehring won a court order to see
Jenna, the 7-year-old daughter of her late son, on the first Sunday of each
month.
</P>
<P>
	   But Jenna's mom, Julie Mehring, estranged from Jenna's dad before his death,
repeatedly defied the order. Except for a five-day Christmas break, she has been
in jail since mid-November.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The state is forcing me to choose between my freedom and protecting my
child,'' Julie Mehring said in a statement from jail in Edwardsville, Ill. ``I
choose to protect my child.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ella Mehring's attorney, Margaret Walsh, says her client is ``a genuinely
sweet grandmother'' who poses no threat to Jenna.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The grandmother is just sick about this,'' Walsh says. ``But she's
sticking with it. She feels some good might come of it for somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
	   Parental rights were pivotal in the Washington state case that goes before
the U.S. Supreme Court for oral arguments Wednesday. The nine justices -- six of
them grandparents -- are expected to issue a decision in the summer.
</P>
<P>
	   Washington state's Supreme Court, voting 5-4 a year ago, quashed a lower
court ruling that allowed Gary and Jennifer Troxel of Anacortes, Wash., to see
their two granddaughters over the objections of the girls' mother. The girls'
father, Brad Troxel, committed suicide in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   ``State intervention to better a child's quality of life through third-party
visitation is not justified where the child's circumstances are otherwise
satisfactory,'' the state high court said.
</P>
<P>
	   Visitation laws have been struck down or sharply narrowed in a few other
states, including Florida, Georgia and Tennessee, but generally have survived
court challenges.
</P>
<P>
	   Laws vary regarding grounds for visitation. In most states, grandparents
must demonstrate that visits are in a child's best interest; in some states they
face the tougher task of proving a child would suffer harm without the visits.
</P>
<P>
	   Historically, grandparents had no legal standing to obtain court-ordered
visits. But the increase in divorces beginning in the 1960s and '70s, coupled
with the growing political clout of senior citizens, prompted every state to
pass a visitation law in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the most powerful lobbying groups for grandparents -- the American
Association of Retired Persons -- has filed a brief with the Supreme Court
supporting the Washington law.
</P>
<P>
	   Rochelle Bobroff, an AARP attorney, says her group hopes the Supreme Court
would not raise the threshold so high that grandparents could seek visitation
orders only in extreme cases.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't say any grandparent can see any grandchild. It's not about an
automatic right,'' she says. ``It's about a chance to go before a court, to get
in the door.''
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens of aggrieved grandparents, including the Militellos, have been helped
through the courtroom door by Richard Victor, a lawyer from Bloomfield Hills,
Mich., who founded the Grandparents Rights Organization.
</P>
<P>
	   He says the Supreme Court, in light of the fast-changing nature of America's
families, should ensure that the interests of children and grandparents are
considered fairly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A woman who divorces her husband or a mother of children whose father has
died may no longer be related to the grandparents of her own children,'' Victor
says. ``But her children still have a bloodline and heritage to adults who are
their grandparents and thus their family.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Should the parent, one in a chain of three, be given the constitutional
sanction to amputate the family unit of the child?''
</P>
<P>
	   Among those intervening on the other side -- in opposition to visitation
laws -- is the Coalition for the Restoration of Parental Rights.The group has
been particularly vocal in Florida, contending that the state's large population
of senior citizens is able to pressure legislators to override parental rights.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have all witnessed the effect of the powerful lobby of the grandparent
forced-visitation movement and the tremendous amount of damage it causes,'' says
the Web site of the coalition's Florida chapter. ``The grandparents who sue for
visitation... are not the sweet Granny, baking cookies and apple pies.''
</P>
<P>
	   The coalition, and other critics of forced visitation, say some grandparents
pursue costly litigation not for their grandchildren's sake but out of
vindictiveness toward an estranged son-in-law or daughter-in-law.
</P>
<P>
	   Also intervening before the Supreme Court -- arguing for an overhaul of
visitation laws nationwide -- are several women's rights and lesbian rights
groups which endorse a brief submitted by the Northwest Women's Law Center of
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
	   The center's counsel, Cathy Zavis, argues that single mothers should be free
to resist unwanted visits from ex-boyfriends or grandparents without being
forced into costly litigation. But Zavis says visitation rights should be
available to ``de facto parents'' -- anyone who played a significant parent-like
role in a child's life, whether a grandparent or a co-parent in a same-sex
partnership.
</P>
<P>
	   ``While the grandparent-grandchild relationship may be important and
pleasurable,'' she writes, ``it does not inherently rise to the level of
significance in the child's life to warrant intrusion into constitutionally
protected parental autonomy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Only where the grandparent played a de facto parenting role in the child's
life is the relationship entitled to constitutional protection.''
</P>
<P>
	   Given the pain that can arise from court battles, even experts who support
visitation rights urge grandparents to consider alternatives such as third-party
mediation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Children need both their parents and grandparents,'' says psychiatrist
Arthur Kornhaber, author of several books on grandparenting. ``Rarely should
litigation take place -- and only as a last resort. It ups the ante of misery.''
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Kudzu Vines Made Useful  </HEADLINE>
   By MELINDA DESLATTE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   RUTHERFORDTON, N.C. (AP) -- Edith Edwards picks the kudzu leaves one by one
in the cool of the evening, piling them neatly as she thinks of the meals and
medicines she can make from the shimmery green plant.
</P>
<P>
	   The vines, withering now, can be woven into fine wreaths and baskets. The
roots, which hibernate until spring, can make a potent starch. She knows not to
waste any parts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would like to challenge the people of the Southeast to take all the
kudzu vines that go up the trees, pull them out and put them to work,'' she
says. ``When Americans find out what they can do with kudzu, they will realize
how valuable it is.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kudzu valuable?
</P>
<P>
	   Over the past century, the creeping vines have earned the appellation
``Green Menace.'' Kudzu originally was spread to curb soil erosion on Southern
farms. Too late, farmers found it was virtually unstoppable. The U.S. Forest
Service estimates kudzu covers 7 million acres of the South, smothering
everything in its path with green leaves and purple blossoms.
</P>
<P>
	   Southerners and scientists alike call the plant an annoying weed, ``the vine
that ate the South.'' Edith, the queen of kudzu, is more philosophical: ``Lots
of things are a nuisance. You just have to take control of it.''
</P>
<P>
	   The 73-year-old farmer's wife has plumbed kudzu's potential for 30 years,
and her business, Kudzu Konnection, is attracting attention all across the
South.
</P>
<P>
	   Edith and her husband, Henry, turn their 10 acres of kudzu into wreaths,
baskets, potato chip-like snacks, quiche, tea, syrup, paper, furniture,
medicines. They also feed it to the horses and cattle on their 400-acre farm.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a hobby grown into a business,'' she says, proudly fingering a glass
jar of freshly made kudzu jelly. ``We won't get rich, but we'll educate people,
and it's fun.''
</P>
<P>
	   Kudzu Konnection has been around about 15 years. Edwards incorporated the
company the same year a Charlotte broadcaster dubbed her the ``Kudzu Queen,'' a
nickname that has extended to her family.
</P>
<P>
	   Her daughter, Caroline Edwards, 40, has been christened the ``Kudzu Kid''
after inheriting her mom's passion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It can be used for anything. You can build with it, you can eat it and
it's a medicine,'' Caroline says. ``But it took us 15 years to learn all this.''
</P>
<P>
	   Edith remembers how it all began. She and her husband moved from Maryland to
Rutherford County in 1961 to take over his parents' farm, where he was born. The
couple moved into the old white frame house that has stood on the land since the
turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
	   They began dairy farming, but a drought threatened their cows' forage. To
supplement the grain, they turned to the only forage green: kudzu.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We found out that it would be OK to feed it to the cattle,'' Edith
recalls. ``It pickled overnight, and the cows ate it like it was ice cream.''
</P>
<P>
	   The drought also piqued a broader interest. Then the kudzu bible -- ``The
Book of Kudzu'' -- came out in 1977, detailing an array of other uses for the
vines and leaves. Edith has kept it in or near her kitchen for the past two
decades.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It took me about three years to get up the nerve to french-fry kudzu
leaves and eat them,'' she says. ``When I did, french-fried kudzu leaves are
another world. They really are a treat.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Edwardses have retired from dairy farming, but not from kudzu. They
drink kudzu cider and use the leaves to season almost anything. They place kudzu
root starch on the tongue to settle an upset stomach.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My mother called it manna in the wilderness, and it really is,'' Edith
says.

<HEADLINE> Lives Saved in Venezuela Slum  </HEADLINE>
   By BART JONES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- When killer floods sent an avalanche of mud and
boulders raging through the Catuche slum in northern Caracas, community leaders
quickly took to the streets with megaphones to warn people to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
	   Residents helped neighbors salvage clothes and furniture. Families streamed
out of their homes and fled to higher ground.
</P>
<P>
	   While hundreds were killed in similar slums along a mountain that collapsed
on itself on Dec. 15, in Catuche -- a slum noted for its extraordinary community
organization -- roughly a dozen people died.
</P>
<P>
	   The unspeakable death toll in Venezuela's worst natural disaster this
century -- authorities say it could reach 30,000 -- has been partly blamed on
corrupt leaders who abandoned shantytowns to their fate after allowing them to
sprout up uncontrollably.
</P>
<P>
	   But the people of Catuche have long fought against the kind of neglect that
made other Venezuelan slumdwellers so vulnerable when the mudslides hit. And
their efforts paid off.
</P>
<P>
	   Catuche has been recognized by the U.N. Development Program as a model for
improving conditions in poor neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
	   The neighborhood is a hodgepodge of clay block houses crammed on top of each
other on the sides of a river ravine near Venezuela's Supreme Court. The
mudslides demolished 800 homes, leaving 5,000 people -- half the slum's
population -- homeless.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the neighborhood is now pushing ahead with plans to rebuild while
other slums are busy mourning their dead.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The community organization saved our lives,'' said Jesuit priest Jose
Virtuoso, whose religious order has worked in the slum for a decade.
</P>
<P>
	   The community has cut crime, cemented over parts of a sewage-filled river
with walkways, established after-school study and enrichment programs, and
created a community newspaper.
</P>
<P>
	   Gang members who used to terrorize the neighborhood with shootouts were
persuaded to take on jobs cleaning up garbage, planting trees and installing
lightposts. In parts of the slum where sewers were installed, the river has come
back to life, with fish, crabs and ducks reappearing for the first time in
years.
</P>
<P>
	   By the time the mudslides hit, some residents had already been moved out of
shacks that were perched over the river on makeshift bridges. Had they still
been there, they would have been crushed by torrents of mud and water reaching
three stories high.
</P>
<P>
	   Today they live in attractive two- and three-bedroom apartments on higher,
safer ground. From their apartment windows they screamed warnings for residents
below them to run.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The fact that they were already organized ... naturally helped them in the
immediate and rapid response they made to evacuate,'' said Angel Rangel,
Venezuela's national civil defense director.
</P>
<P>
	   Catuche's residents still have the daunting task of rebuilding. Much of the
neighborhood is barely recognizable.
</P>
<P>
	   Community leader Margarita Hernandez, 52, comes back every day to stare at
the spot where she lived for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That was my house,'' she said, pointing to a mound of dirt. At night, she
replays scenes of the floods in nightmares.
</P>
<P>
	   Community leaders already had plans to build new housing to relocate 4,000
people who live in Catuche's most dangerous zones. The $15 million project was
to take 10 years. Now the timetable has been compressed to 18 months.
</P>
<P>
	   ``During 10 years, a social fabric has developed, a community that is still
alive,'' Virtuoso said.

<HEADLINE> Brown Mulls First Year in Office  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHELLE LOCKE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Sitting in a sun-splashed city square, Jerry Brown
reflected on 1999: Crime was down, jobs were up and the media buzz went on,
stoked by curiosity over what happens when a governor turns mayor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's been a very positive year,'' said Brown of his first year in office.
</P>
<P>
	   Elected on a promise to bring change to this struggling city of about
400,000, Brown made good. He booted out the police chief, engineered the hasty
retreat of the school superintendent and said so long to his press secretary.
</P>
<P>
	   He also created an arts council, negotiated with developers to refurbish
vacant buildings, presided over a technology summit that drew 300 civic leaders
and appointed revered tattoo artist Don Ed Hardy to the Oakland Cultural Arts
Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Change is good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   After Brown's promises to reclaim the streets, the schools, the city, just
how much has changed in the past year?
</P>
<P>
	   -- Developers are putting millions of dollars into new stores and apartments
downtown and a new five-star hotel is planned.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Serious crime is down 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Oakland has attracted a number of high-tech firms, including Cybergold,
the Internet marketing firm stolen away from Berkeley and employing 130 people,
and Zhone Technologies, which promises 1,500 workers.
</P>
<P>
	   There has been quite a bit of change going on inside City Hall, too.
</P>
<P>
	   Saying that the status quo had to go in a town plagued by high crime and low
test scores, Brown used the strong-mayor powers given to him by voters to demand
the resignation of the police chief. He worked with state Sen. Don Perata to put
pressure on the school superintendent to resign.
</P>
<P>
	   Brown's press secretary abruptly stepped down at year's end amid reports
that her replacement was quietly being recruited.
</P>
<P>
	   Brown's take-no-prisoners style has ruffled some.
</P>
<P>
	   At a city council meeting in November, he was booed as he spoke in favor of
his proposed ballot measure that would give him the power to appoint three
additional members to the school board.
</P>
<P>
	   Councilwoman Nancy Nadel, one of four on the eight-member council to oppose
the measure, called the proposal a ``combination of democracy and
dictatorship.''
</P>
<P>
	   Brown carried the day with his tie-breaking vote.
</P>
<P>
	   But so far, the majority of people seem to like it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I feel strongly he's got ideas that already has most people looking up to
a higher horizon,'' said Ralph Williams, known as the ``Mayor of West Oakland,''
the once jazzy, now blighted section of town that is attempting a comeback.
</P>
<P>
	   While community support for Brown appears to be strong, some are dismayed to
see him courting the corporations he once berated as a radio talk show host.
</P>
<P>
	   JerryWatch, a group formed by detractors to monitor Brown's doings, has
lampooned his current incarnation as ``Me the People,'' a play on the name of
his grassroots political organization, ``We the People.''
</P>
<P>
	   They are worried that Brown's plan to liven up Oakland's forlorn inner city
with 10,000 new residents will force out the poor and minorities. Oakland today
is 43 percent black, 14 percent Hispanic, 14 percent Asian and 28 percent white.
</P>
<P>
	   Brown said his critics are not thinking clearly.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know how many people really are against taking the necessary steps
to create a more prosperous Oakland. It's a very strange position to sustain
except rhetorically.''
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview at an outdoor cafe near City Hall this week, the flimsy
table reverberated as Brown smacked the surface with his hand to punctuate a
passionate explanation of why it's important to recognize Oakland's virtues --
housing bargains, great weather, easy access to San Francisco -- and its vices.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a tendency toward denial and denial blocks improvement. So while
it might be painful to expose some of the warts, it's the only way we really get
full recovery.''
</P>
<P>
	   Brown doesn't take credit for all the improvements that have happened in his
first year. ``The market pressure has certainly lifted Oakland,'' he pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
	   What's next for the former Buddhist scholar, former two-term California
governor, former three-time presidential candidate and former Democrat? (He
re-registered as nonpartisan after moving to Oakland six years ago.)
</P>
<P>
	   Brown said he hasn't decided whether he wants a second term as mayor after
his four years are up.
</P>
<P>
	   As to whether he'd like to swap his current digs, for something, say, larger
and whiter with a view of the Washington Mall, he said, ``That's not a question
you can ask the mayor of Oakland after Year One.''

<HEADLINE> McCain Questions Rivals on Military  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GOFFSTOWN, N.H. (AP) -- Sen. John McCain raised the prospect of building a
second canal for transoceanic travel Sunday, but just as quickly the Republican
presidential candidate conceded it would be ``nearly impossible'' to do.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, in a speech to a state party fund-raiser at the University of New
Hampshire in Durham, McCain questioned the qualifications of the two Democratic
presidential contenders, Vice President Al Gore and former New Jersey Sen. Bill
Bradley, to be commander-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
	   His remarks were in reaction to statements the two have made recently about
gays in the military.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore first insisted in a debate that anyone he appointed to the Joint Chiefs
of Staff must share his belief that gays should be allowed to serve openly in
the military. He later modified his comment, saying he would not tolerate any
commander who would not follow his orders.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said at the same debate that a litmus test was unnecessary, because
military officers follow orders from their commander-in-chief no matter what.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain complained about the statements during his speech to the New
Hampshire Republican State Committee, and while speaking with reporters
afterward. He said: ``If anyone imposes a social agenda on the prospective
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff -- which totally politicizes that job --
then they're not qualified.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Bradley camp was quick to respond, saying their candidate had no such
litmus test.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Clearly Senator McCain's statement has more to do with Republican
presidential politics than with candidate qualifications,'' said Bradley
communications director Anita Dunn.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain made his canal remark earlier in the day in response to a question at
a political forum for high school and college students.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking with reporters after that appearance, he explained that he was not
advocating building a second Panama Canal, over which the United States just
surrendered control back to its Central American host nation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If there was some dire emergency that shut down the canal, obviously we
would have to look at other options, but as I said, every option I look at is so
expensive and so difficult that there's very little viability associated with
that option,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   He added: ``In full disclosure, it would be nearly impossible.''
</P>
<P>
	   The canal comment came amid an afternoon of old-fashioned political energy,
as McCain and some of his fellow Republican presidential candidates took turns
speaking to politically interested youth about the country's future and the
government they will soon inherit.
</P>
<P>
	   High school and college students who gathered at the Dana Center on the
campus of Saint Anselm College squealed upon seeing the contenders and rushed to
grab bumper stickers and other campaign collectables. Freewheeling debates also
broke out in the auditorium's lobby as individuals argued over who was the
better candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've had a pretty good past. We have to give you a good future,'' Sen.
Orrin Hatch of Utah told the audience in remarks kicking off the event.
</P>
<P>
	   He said part of the way to guarantee that is by selecting judges who have
``good health, high morals and good integrity.''
</P>
<P>
	   Texas Gov. George W. Bush was asked how he would handle the ethical
questions sure to arise from the mapping of the human genome, Bush said he would
convene a panel of top scientists, lawyers and ethicists.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I worry about cloning. I worry about people taking the place of God,'' he
said. ``There are going to be some very thorny issues ahead.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked whether sex education should be federally funded, publisher Steve
Forbes spoke of his larger approach to education.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I the best education is letting parents decide the best schools to send
their children,'' he said. ``I would trust parents not politics. Let them choose
a school and a program that's right for you.''
</P>
<P>
	   About 500 students attended the gathering, which was organized the Close Up
Foundation, the National Association of Secretary of States, the Library and
Archives of New Hampshire Political Tradition and the state Republican and
Democratic parties.
</P>
<P>
	   Each candidate was given 20 minutes to speak and to answer questions on a
stage sparsely adorned with a stool and an Oriental rug.
</P>
<P>
	   The two candidates who skipped the youth forum, radio talk show host Alan
Keyes and conservative activist Gary Bauer, later delivered speeches to the
dinner at UNH.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes repeated his anti-abortion views, at one point summing them up by
saying, ``It's not a mother's choice, not a father's choice, not a judge's
choice.''
</P>
<P>
	   In his remarks, Bauer was critical of the violence in society and the
Clinton administration's response to it.
</P>
<P>
	   He said: ``We cannot take this kind of value-free, virtue-free leadership
any longer. My friends, we must get a Republican back in office as president of
the United States.''

<HEADLINE> Scientists Seek To Expand Cloning  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ALBANY, Ga. (AP) -- Researchers working on cattle cloning aren't just trying
to produce a better steak. Eventually, they hope animal cloning will provide new
sources of medicines and organs, reduce birth defects and help feed people in
poor countries.
</P>
<P>
	   The University of Georgia and the Georgia Research Alliance, which is
responsible for attracting world-class scientists to the state, have persuaded a
leading expert to conduct cloning research in Athens.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Stice and his staff will focus initially on cloning genetically
superior cattle. More consistent cattle would provide higher-quality beef for
consumers. Later, the team wants to become the first to successfully clone a
pig.
</P>
<P>
	   "Cloning of animals obviously gets some people concerned," said Stice,
formerly the chief scientist at Advanced Cell Technology Inc. in Worcester,
Mass. "There are good reasons to do it in animal agriculture to improve
efficiency and use fewer resources.
</P>
<P>
	   "People talk about playing God," he said. "I try to explain that we're
really just trying to do what Mother Nature is allowing us to do."
</P>
<P>
	   Stice's earlier research contributed to the world's first calf cloning.
Later, he was the first to clone transgenic cattle. Such genetically modified
animals could someday produce human medicines or better meat and milk, he says.
</P>
<P>
	   "Cloning is a technology that will allow a lot of development to happen,"
Stice said.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers are collecting cells from the skin and ovaries of
genetically superior beef cattle. To create a clone, they insert the donor's
cells into a cow's egg that has had the nucleus removed. By fusing them
together, they create an embryo.
</P>
<P>
	   The embryo is placed in the womb of a surrogate cow that eventually gives
birth to a duplicate of the donor animal.
</P>
<P>
	   Because of the complexities of the technology, it could be five to 10 years
before cloned cattle are available for commercial breeding.
</P>
<P>
	   Stice said his team hopes to begin work this spring on the world's first
cloned pig. A scientist in Scotland made headlines in 1996 when he cloned a
sheep. Since then, other scientists have cloned about 100 cattle, but no one has
been able to clone a pig. Their embryos, sperm cells and eggs are sensitive.
</P>
<P>
	   "We do a lot of things in the cloning process," Stice said. "Each time we do
something with that embryo or egg, it decreases the viability. It's hard to get
the pig embryo to live longer than seven days."
</P>
<P>
	   Since pigs and humans are biologically similar, scientists may someday be
able to clone pigs with organs that could be transplanted into humans, Stice
said. "There are 200,000 people in the United States waiting for a kidney
transplant," he noted.
</P>
<P>
	   Stice's staff has collected cells from a half-dozen genetically superior
cattle for cloning. Some are females too old to produce offspring normally.
</P>
<P>
	   With outstanding bulls costing $50,000 or more, it can be costly and
time-consuming to improve herd genetics using conventional methods such as
artificial insemination.
</P>
<P>
	   Georgia Research Alliance Director Bill Todd said each of the organization's
32 eminent scholars, including Stice, receives a $1.5 million endowment for
research and salary enhancement.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Talks Dwindle Down  </HEADLINE>
   By DONNA ABU-NASR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- Peace talks between Israel and Syria dwindled
down to an inconclusive recess, with President Clinton trying to narrow
differences in what his spokesman called ``difficult and complex'' issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Today was to be the last working day in which the Israeli and Syrian
delegation leaders would participate. It was not clear whether the four working
groups of experts handling the technical negotiations would stay behind.
</P>
<P>
	   An administration official said Clinton was unlikely to return to
Shepherdstown today.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Clearly we are coming to the end of the leaders' participation here this
week,'' State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said he did not expect an agreement to emerge but that Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa were likely to
meet again ``sooner rather than later.''
</P>
<P>
	   Barak was making plans to depart for home later today. Al-Sharaa was likely
to follow on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, Clinton renewed his efforts to energize the talks, returning to
the negotiating site 70 miles northwest of Washington for the fifth time in the
weeklong negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is an ongoing process. The issues are difficult and complex,'' said
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
	   The president brought together Barak and al-Sharaa for their third
face-to-face meeting, this time over a 2 1/2-hour dinner at the National
Conservation Training Center during which the Israeli and Syrian leaders broke
bread together for the first time. The leaders enjoyed a meal of tenderloin of
beef with morel sauce, along with chardonnay and merlot wines.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton later held separate meetings with al-Sharaa and Barak.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said Clinton felt that ``it was a very good and serious exchange of
views'' and all issues came up at dinner.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was a fairly warm atmosphere,'' the spokesman added. ``It was pretty
cordial.''
</P>
<P>
	   A source close to the Syrian delegation said beforehand that the focus of
the working dinner would be a seven-page document summarizing points of accord
and discord, that Clinton presented to both leaders on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Syrians made
revisions to the document that they would bring up during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   The source stressed that the Israelis had to accept Syria's border terms --
a withdrawal to the border that existed at the eve of the 1967 Mideast war,
adding that Damascus would not make compromises on that issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Committees met Sunday on all the key issues -- the demarcation of borders,
security arrangements, normal peaceful relations and water sharing.
</P>
<P>
	   The State Department's Rubin said the seven-page document could become the
basis for an eventual ``core agreement.'' But he said Israel and Syria still
faced ``enormous decisions'' and ``we don't expect those decisions to be made in
a matter of days,''
</P>
<P>
	   American mediators had not offered ``bridging proposals'' designed to close
the gap where the two sides were in disagreement, Rubin added.

<HEADLINE> Cardinal honored during Mass for 80th birthday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - The first of several events honoring Cardinal John
O'Connor's upcoming 80th birthday took place at St. Patrick's Cathedral with the
cardinal standing during most of the Mass and sounding strong.
<P>
	   O'Connor, who has complained of weakness in his legs as an aftereffect of
brain surgery and radiation treatment, did not mount the steps to the pulpit,
where he traditionally gives his sermon. But he stood for 20 minutes at a
stretch near the high altar, where he has sat for the past few Sundays.
</P>
<P>
	   The service ended with a vicar from the New York Archdiocese wishing the
cardinal a happy birthday. The cardinal turns 80 on Saturday and is to be feted
that night at a dinner celebrating his 16-year tenure as spiritual leader of the
area's 2 million Catholics. There will also be one more Mass at St. Patrick's
Cathedral next weekend in honor of his birthday.
</P>
<P>
	   While his voice was strong Sunday, O'Connor failed at a couple of points in
his sermon to remember the year World War II ended.
</P>
<P>
	   The lapses came as O'Connor recalled that the dropping of nuclear bombs on
Hiroshima and Nagasaki inspired a flood of young men and women to devote their
lives to the church as nuns, monks and priests.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't want the horror repeated, but we do want the sacrifices, we do
want the vocations," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In describing the bombings, he said: "It was a horror back in 19--," but he
never finished the sentence. After a brief pause, he added: "At the end of World
War II. It's eluding me."
</P>
<P>
	   The cardinal was ordained to the priesthood at age 25 in late 1945, a few
months after the nuclear bombings of the two Japanese cities and the end of
World War II.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor's self-deprecating wit was very much in evidence as he joked about
the weight he's gained since the brain tumor was removed in August.
</P>
<P>
	   He said that as he left his residence Sunday morning, "One of my trusted
associates said, 'You look fatter than ever."'
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor credited his interest in the priesthood to the Christian Brothers
who taught him at West Catholic High School in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was because of those brothers that I ultimately entered the seminary,"
he said. "I was very young. People might have said I was too young to be trained
for the seminary."
</P>
<P>
	   O'Connor has said that he does not expect to head the archdiocese much
longer. On Sunday, he repeated several times a quote from the Gospel reading
that seemed to hint at his readiness to have the pope appoint his successor:
"One more powerful than I is to come after me. I am not worthy to stoop and
untie his sandal."

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's become an Al Gore staple: Let's drop those nasty
30-second campaign ads, he suggests to his rival for the Democratic presidential
nomination, and just debate twice a week.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Bradley has declined time and again, but the vice president presses on.
``I know that you have said no, but as they say on that `Millionaire' show: Is
that your final answer?'' Gore asked in a weekend debate.
</P>
<P>
	   You can say plenty in 30 seconds, Bradley responded, ``if you know what you
believe.''
</P>
<P>
	   So who's right? Would scrapping television ads for more debates lead to a
more informed electorate?
</P>
<P>
	   Ads may get a bad rap, but they actually do more good than harm, say the
professionals who study them. Furthermore, debates aren't as substantive as some
would like to believe.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You'll notice moderators keep saying to give short answers. The debates,
although we like to imagine they're better, aren't that much better,'' said Bill
Benoit, a communication professor at the University of Missouri who has studied
every political ad and presidential debate since the 1950s.
</P>
<P>
	   Besides, he said, ``hardly anyone watches these debates.''
</P>
<P>
	   TV commercials, by contrast, reach many more people, showing up whether a
viewer is thinking about politics or not.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The American people collectively know so little about politics, the last
thing we ought to do is shut off any channel of communication between the
candidates and the voters,'' said Larry Sabato, a political scientist at the
University of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics say the brief ads often smack of manipulation and fluff. They also
come to viewers unfiltered, with no one to point out when a candidate is shading
the truth.
</P>
<P>
	   Many news organizations, including The Associated Press, offer ``ad
watches'' in which claims are analyzed for accuracy. That helps keep the ads
honest, Benoit said in a telephone interview. Meanwhile, he said, when a
candidate gives a speech filled with policy ideas, many reporters focus on the
strategy and the horse race, not the substance.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the years, ads have become more substantive, dealing more with policy
than with personality, Benoit said. ``TV spots are really important, and even
though they're short, voters learn from them.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Gore, figuring he has seized on a winning issue, has issued his
challenge repeatedly.
</P>
<P>
	   Advisers patterned the no-ad offer on one made in 1998 by Democrat John
Edwards, who upset Republican Sen. Lauch Faircloth in North Carolina. Edwards
proposed scrapping ads; Faircloth declined. Bob Shrum, who advised Edwards,
brought the idea to Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   The challenge made sense for Gore on several levels. While Bradley champions
an overhaul of campaign finance, the no-ad offer promotes Gore's own reformer
image. And as the vice president, he's already well known nationally, whereas
Bradley needs ads to spread his name.
</P>
<P>
	   In recent days, Gore has revised his offer, saying he'd drop ads in just a
single state such as New Hampshire, where Bradley is already well known. The
former New Jersey senator again declined.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Candidates (are) going out and telling people what they believe,'' Bradley
said in their Saturday debate. ``And in 30 seconds you can say a lot.''
</P>
<P>
	   So what about this year's crop of ads. Are they substantive, or misleading?
</P>
<P>
	   In one ad, running now in Iowa, Bradley talks about education, telling
viewers the following facts: He went to a public high school and graduated in
1961. He had terrific teachers. Today's teachers need new skills. He has a plan
to recruit 60,000 new teachers a year for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
	   With pictures of his high school on the screen, this ad is meant to evoke a
feeling as much as impart information. It's meant to say that Bradley cares
about education, just like the voters.
</P>
<P>
	   It doesn't directly address Gore's accusation that Bradley lacks a
comprehensive plan for education and doesn't mention that hiring 60,000 teachers
would cost $1.3 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's own education ad is more specific. He's for universal pre-school,
smaller classes, higher standards, teacher training and connecting every
classroom to the Internet. It notes that he's been endorsed by two teachers'
unions.
</P>
<P>
	   It also neglects to mention the cost of his plan -- $115 billion over 10
years.
</P>
<P>
	   On the whole, though, these and other ads still gives voters useful
information, academics say.
</P>
<P>
	   Sabato said he used to be quite critical of campaign ads until a political
consultant made him think about the power of a few short sentences: ``I declare
war,'' for instance, or ``I love you.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those are among most powerful things that a human being can utter,'' he
said. ``If you do have something to say, you can make the point quickly and in a
memorable fashion.''

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Syrian Talks Winding Down  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- President Clinton renewed his efforts to push
Israeli and Syrian negotiators toward a land-for-peace treaty with a series of
meetings Sunday evening, but the talks appeared to be winding down without even
a tentative agreement.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Clearly we are coming to the end of the leaders' participation here this
week,'' the State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a post-midnight session with reporters, Rubin said he did not expect an
agreement to emerge and that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa were likely to meet again ``sooner rather than
later.''
</P>
<P>
	   An administration official said, meanwhile, Clinton was unlikely to return
to the negotiations on Monday. ``At the leader level this round is pretty much
concluded,'' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   That left open the possibility Barak and al-Sharaa would leave experts
behind to try to keep whittling away at the issues.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We think there have been a lot of positive developments,'' Rubin said
after Clinton met for 2 1/2 hours with Barak and al-Sharaa and then separately
with each of them.
</P>
<P>
	   The Israeli foreign minister, David Levy, left for Morocco and a meeting
there with King Mohamed VI.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak, describing the weeklong talks over territory, peace terms, water and
security as complex and difficult, was making plans to depart for home Monday
and diplomatic sources said al-Sharaa was likely to follow on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   On the sensitive issue of establishing a new border, once Israel pulls back
on the Golan Heights, Levy said before departing that ``nothing has been agreed
upon.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, who had intervened in the negotiations four times before Sunday,
returned to the site of the talks after nightfall Sunday. ``He's going for
meetings,'' a White House official said. ``The process continues.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is an ongoing process,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
``The issues are difficult and complex.''
</P>
<P>
	   A source close to the Syrian delegation said the focus of the working dinner
would be the seven-page document, which is a summary of points of accord and
discord, that Clinton presented to both leaders on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Syrians have made
revisions to the document that they would bring up during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   The source stressed that the Israelis had to accept Syria's border terms,
adding that Damascus would not make compromises on that issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, Barak and al-Sharaa all were dressed casually as waiters served
tenderloin of beef with morel sauce, along with chardonnay and merlot wines.
</P>
<P>
	   Committees met Sunday on all the key issues, and the State Department
spokesman James P. Rubin said the two sides responded positively to the
statement presented Friday by the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The document could become the basis for an eventual ``core agreement,''
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   But he said Israel and Syria still faced ``enormous decisions'' and ``we
don't expect those decisions to be made in a matter of days,''
</P>
<P>
	   American mediators had not offered ``bridging proposals'' designed to close
the gap where the two sides were in disagreement, Rubin added.
</P>
<P>
	   In Jerusalem, Israel Cabinet Minister Haim Ramon said Syria had refused to
permit Israel to retain an early warning station on the Golan Heights once it is
relinquished.
</P>
<P>
	   But, Ramon said, Syria was prepared to consider a station manned mostly by
American and French personnel, with a Syrian presence and a symbolic Israeli
presence.
</P>
<P>
	   Yielding the plateau would strip Israel of a capability to watch any Syrian
military preparations, including tanks rolling down toward the border.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak and al-Sharaa could leave behind experts to continue deliberations.
But Rubin said there was no decision on how negotiations would proceed, although
he said the United States wanted full-blown negotiations to reconvene ``sooner
rather than later.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no doubt that the negotiation is difficult,'' Barak told Israeli
reporters while touring the Antietam National Battlefield, a Civil War site in
Sharpsburg, Md., with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
	   In his first public remarks since the talks began Jan. 3, Barak said ``the
negotiation is very complex.''
</P>
<P>
	   The prime minister, speaking Hebrew, also gave assurances to the Israeli
public that ``we will not sign an agreement unless, in our opinion, it will
strengthen the security of Israel and address its vital needs.''
</P>
<P>
	   Israel is contemplating a withdrawal from the Golan Heights, a border
highground with a commanding view of Syria, in exchange for a peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak, his wife, Nava, and Levy were shown a 26-minute documentary film
recreating the Antietam battle in which North and South suffered 22,726
casualties on Sept. 17, 1862.
</P>
<P>
	   They also listened to a lecture about the bloody day from a National Park
Service ranger and Bruce Reidel, who is on the Near East desk at the National
Security Council and a Civil War buff.
</P>
<P>
	   Albright then hosted a luncheon for Barak at Hillsboro, her Virginia retreat
across the border from West Virginia, and returned to the secluded negotiations
site just outside Shepherdstown to meet with al-Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Sunday, Al-Hayat, a Saudi newspaper published in London, said Israel
had agreed to pull back to the 1923 border with Syria and that Syria was
insisting on a deeper pullback, to the border that existed at the eve of the
1967 Mideast war.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said the account was not credible. He told reporters the newspaper's
report differed in ``substantive ways'' from the document prepared at Albright's
direction and presented by Clinton to Barak and al-Sharaa on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   In Syria, the state-run Al-Thawra newspaper, said Sunday that the West
Virginia peace talks are ``in serious danger.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is clear that there are Israeli directives to ... break up the talks in
an attempt to add hurdles and hamper them to leave the political process
spinning in place,'' the newspaper said in an editorial.

Ecuador Head Fixes Exchange Rate

	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Besieged by calls for his resignation amid a
deepening economic crisis, Ecuador's president announced late Sunday that he was
fixing the exchange rate to stabilize the nation's plummeting currency. n a
20-minute televised address to the nation, President Jamil Mahuad also said that
his 15-member Cabinet had tendered its resignation and that he would name
replacements for the ministers in the coming days. A deal had been hammered out
with Congress to pave the way for approval of several economic reforms, he said,
including "the modernization of the state" -- a term interpreted by many to mean
the privatization of state industries.

unarmed civilians in dozens of incidents. In an interview with The Associated
Press, Army Secretary Louis Caldera said it is not possible to investigate every

destined for Libya was widely seen as an embarrassment to both countries. The

<HEADLINE> McCain Wants Memos Released  </HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM C. MANN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain is using the federal Freedom of
Information Act to get copies of all his correspondence with federal regulatory
agencies since he entered Congress in 1983.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican presidential candidate's aim is to show that his contacts
with the agencies' officials on behalf of big donors and other companies were
aboveboard.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's campaign spokesman, Howard Opinsky, said the request is being
channeled through the Senate Commerce Committee, which the Arizona lawmaker
chairs, using the FOIA rather than the less formal tactic of a direct request.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a normal FOIA request that any American can make of any agency,''
Opinsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   The spokesman said the request covers all documents since McCain entered the
House in 1983 for his first of two terms. He became a senator in 1987.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain said Sunday on CBS' ``Face the Nation'' that the requests to make his
correspondence public would cover only the past 10 years or so. Asked for
clarification, Opinsky said McCain's order to his staff covered his career in
Congress, and the FOIA documents were drafted under that guideline.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of documents released by his campaign show the senator wrote
letters on behalf of more than a dozen contributors over the past three years to
federal regulators overseen by his committee. Among agencies he prodded were the
Federal Communications Commission and the Transportation Department.
</P>
<P>
	   As he has before, McCain said Sunday that his only motive was to help
constituents and other Americans affected by government actions. Many of the
letters were to push recalcitrant agencies to act on delayed in decision-making.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic presidential hopeful Bill Bradley, a partner with McCain in the
push to overhaul campaign finance laws, told reporters, meanwhile, that he ``had
a practice of not intervening in regulatory matters.'' His Senate correspondence
is archived at Princeton University. ``Go take a look,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   On ABC's ``This Week,'' former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan.,
defended McCain, a longtime colleague. ``I would guess if you searched the files
of the 100 senators, they've all had letters like that,'' Dole said.
</P>
<P>
	   Appearing on the program with her husband, Elizabeth Dole, forced out of the
GOP presidential race for lack of money, said McCain had not acted
inappropriately. ``I mean, it's not inappropriate to ask for your constituents
that a decision be made. Up, down, whatever it is,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> McCain Questions Rivals on Military  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DURHAM, N.H. (AP) -- Sen. John McCain questions whether the two Democratic
presidential candidates are qualified to be commander in chief because of their
beliefs about gays in the military.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If anyone imposes a social agenda on the prospective chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff -- which totally politicizes that job -- then they're not
qualified,'' McCain said Sunday after addressing a Republican State Committee
dinner held at the University of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking at a youth forum earlier in the day, the former Navy officer raised
the prospect of building a second canal for transoceanic travel, like the Panama
Canal, but just as quickly conceded it would be ``nearly impossible'' to do.
</P>
<P>
	   The comments came on a day of busy politicking by the Republican
presidential candidates, first at the youth forum at St. Anselm College in
Goffstown, N.H., and then at the university. The pace of events highlight the
fast approach of the New Hampshire primary, the nation's first, on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   The six GOP contenders were shifting their focus to the Middle West today,
with an evening debate scheduled at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Mich.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's remarks about gays in the military stemmed from comments that
Democratic rivals Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley made on
the subject during a debate last week.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore first insisted that anyone he appointed to the Joint Chiefs of Staff
must share his belief that gays should be allowed to serve openly in the
military. At a news conference two days later, he modified his comment, saying
he would not tolerate any commander who would not follow his orders.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said at the same debate that a litmus test was unnecessary because
military officers follow orders from their commander in chief no matter what.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bradley camp replied to McCain's criticism Sunday, saying their
candidate had no litmus test. ``Clearly, Senator McCain's statement has more to
do with Republican presidential politics than with candidate qualifications,''
said Bradley communications director Anita Dunn.
</P>
<P>
	   In his remarks to the youth forum, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah said one way to
guarantee a good future for the country is by selecting judges who have ``good
health, high morals and good integrity.''
</P>
<P>
	   Texas Gov. George W. Bush was asked how he would handle the ethical
questions sure to arise from the mapping of the human genome. He said he would
convene a panel of top scientists, lawyers and ethicists.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I worry about cloning. I worry about people taking the place of God,'' he
said. ``There are going to be some very thorny issues ahead.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked whether sex education should be federally funded, publisher Steve
Forbes spoke of his larger approach to education. He said ``the best education
is letting parents decide the best schools to send their children. I would trust
parents, not politics. Let them choose a school and a program that's right for
you.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain broached the subject of a second canal in answer to a question at the
youth forum.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking with reporters afterward, the senator explained that he was not
advocating building a second Panama Canal, over which the United States just
surrendered control to Panama.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If there was some dire emergency that shut down the canal, obviously we
would have to look at other options, but as I said, every option I look at is so
expensive and so difficult that there's very little viability associated with
that option,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   He added: ``In full disclosure, it would be nearly impossible.''
</P>
<P>
	   About 500 students attended the gathering, which was organized the Close Up
Foundation, the National Association of Secretary of States, the Library and
Archives of New Hampshire Political Tradition and the state Republican and
Democratic parties.
</P>
<P>
	   Each candidate was given 20 minutes to speak and to answer questions on a
stage sparsely adorned with a stool and an Oriental rug.
</P>
<P>
	   The two candidates who skipped the forum, radio talk show host Alan Keyes
and conservative activist Gary Bauer, later delivered speeches at the university
dinner.
</P>
<P>
	   Keyes repeated his anti-abortion views, at one point summing them up by
saying, ``It's not a mother's choice, not a father's choice, not a judge's
choice.''
</P>
<P>
	   In his remarks, Bauer criticized violence in society and the Clinton
administration's response to it. He said: ``We cannot take this kind of
value-free, virtue-free leadership any longer. My friends, we must get a
Republican back in office as president of the United States.''

<HEADLINE> McCain To Unveil Tax Plan Tuesday  </HEADLINE>
   By GLEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GOFFSTOWN, N.H. (AP) -- A tax cut plan that Sen. John McCain will roll out
Tuesday is structured to give reductions to 25 million Americans, most of them
lower- and middle-income.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan would also let people invest up to 20 percent of their payroll
taxes in private retirement accounts, based on an investment manual provided by
the government.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, aides said the plan, which the Republican presidential
candidate will fully describe in a speech to the Concord, N.H., Chamber of
Commerce, would:
</P>
<P>
	   --Expand the children's tax credit from $500 per child to $1,000;
</P>
<P>
	   --Introduce a deduction for long-term health care insurance;
</P>
<P>
	   --Create a package of tax incentives for savings targeted toward education,
medical expenses and retirement.
</P>
<P>
	   Previously, McCain said the plan would also propose broadening the bottom,
15 percent tax bracket to cover a couple's first $70,000 of taxable income.
Aides said that if the federal budget surplus grows even more than projected,
McCain would increase the income range a proportional amount.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking with reporters after addressing a youth forum, McCain contrasted
his proposal with a five-year, $483 billion tax cut proposed by his chief rival
for the GOP nomination, Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe that my plan is the far wiser one, and more responsible one,
because it does not assume that these (budget) surpluses are going to be there
forever,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm very optimistic about the economic future of this country, but to bank
it all on unending surpluses at the possible risk of the Social Security trust
fund is our fundamental disagreement.''

<P>
	   Over the past week, Bush has pounded McCain for opposing his plan, noting in
speeches and GOP debates that it also faces opposition from a Democratic
presidential candidate, Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush says his tax plan protects Social Security by creating a ``lockbox''
around the payroll taxes that fund it. On Sunday, after his own speech to the
youth forum, he agreed that the tax debate highlights a ``fundamental
disagreement'' between McCain and himself.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I believe it is unwise to leave unspent money in Washington, because it
will be spent on bigger government,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush noted that White House and congressional budget analysts are expected
to soon report that budget surpluses for the coming decade may be $800 billion
bigger than last year's $3 trillion estimate.
</P>
<P>
	   The extra money is expected to come from unanticipated federal revenue the
nation's red-hot economy is producing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That makes the idea of having a paltry tax cut even more risky,'' Bush
said.

<HEADLINE> Titans' Dyson Has Big Highlight Now  </HEADLINE>
    By TERESA M. WALKER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Kevin Dyson has a new favorite moment.
</P>
<P>
	   He gave himself and NFL fans everywhere a play for the history books
Saturday when he took a cross-field lateral from Frank Wycheck and ran 75 yards
for a touchdown with 3 seconds left, lifting the Tennessee Titans to an
improbable 22-16 AFC wild-card victory over the Buffalo Bills.
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee will play at Indianapolis next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   For Dyson, the return topped his previous career highlight of a one-handed
touchdown catch against Arizona in the Freedom Bowl during his freshman year at
Utah.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is definitely No. 1," Dyson said Sunday. "You're in the NFL, your
dream, the playoffs, the first playoff game -- you can't beat that."
</P>
<P>
	   His runback provided a highlight for the ages and ammunition for the critics
who have compared him to the receiver taken five slots after him in 1998's draft
-- Randy Moss. As he spent a quiet rookie year catching two touchdown passes,
Moss turned in a Pro Bowl season with Minnesota and set a rookie record with 19
TD catches.
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee officials were criticized for choosing Dyson over Moss with the
16th pick overall, and Dyson got tired of being compared him.
</P>
<P>
	   Teammate Derrick Mason, who would have been on the field instead of Dyson if
not for a mild concussion, said maybe people finally will realize that Dyson can
make plays in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't see why everybody should continue to compare him to Randy Moss
because they're two different players. He plays for Minnesota, and that's a
wide-open kind of offense over there. We play over here, and we've kind of got a
balanced offense," Mason said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dyson started this season off with a bang in the season opener, and it
looked like he had finally arrived. He caught nine passes for 162 yards, the
best game by an Oilers-Titans receiver since Haywood Jefferies totaled 186 yards
on Oct. 12, 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   But Steve McNair went out with back surgery for the next five games, and
backup Neil O'Donnell turned more to his favorite receiver, Yancey Thigpen.
Dyson didn't catch more than six passes in a game the rest of the season. When
Thigpen missed five games with a sprained ankle, Dyson struggled with only 10
receptions in his absence.
</P>
<P>
	   Coach Jeff Fisher said he hoped Dyson's return would boost his confidence
after a frustrating season.
</P>
<P>
	   Dyson, Tennessee's second-leading receiver with 54 receptions this season,
is too busy enjoying the attention he's now getting for his astounding return.
</P>
<P>
	   He spent much of Saturday night returning at least 40 telephone messages. He
woke up at least three times to watch the replay of his return on ESPN, and he
watched the play again Sunday at the Titans' practice facility.
</P>
<P>
	   Dyson had no doubts whatsoever about the lateral immediately after the game,
and he said the replays made him realize why so many people were fussing about
referee Phil Luckett upholding the play, calling it "real, real close."
</P>
<P>
	   But he isn't changing his position.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was a lateral. After seeing it, I was at the 25 and he threw it right
about the 25," Dyson said.

<HEADLINE> 5,000 Jewish Students Seek Identity  </HEADLINE>
   By DINA KRAFT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The college sophomore from New Jersey tucked a note in the
Western Wall, Judaism's holiest site, and stepped back in awe.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I can't believe I'm here, it's kind of overwhelming,'' Jessie Oser said,
her blue eyes wide. ``There is a feeling of being connected to all these other
Jews and to history.''
</P>
<P>
	   Oser, 19, who previously felt only tenuous ties to Judaism, is one of 5,000
college students flown here for the launch of Birthright Israel, a $210 million
project that pays for young Jews to travel to Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   The expense-free trip is an expensive new weapon in the Jewish Diaspora's
battle against assimilation. Organizers hope the tour through history will
foster Jewish belonging.
</P>
<P>
	   In the north, participants slosh through the muddy hills of the Golan
Heights and hear from settlers who are both for and against returning the area
captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War, an issue at the core of renewed
Israeli-Syria peace talks.
</P>
<P>
	   In the south, they climb the stone-strewn path to the ancient fortress of
Masada, where tradition says Jewish zealots killed themselves en masse 2,000
years ago rather than be conquered by Roman troops.
</P>
<P>
	   Oser, a sociology and anthropology major at Tufts University near Boston who
grew up in Princeton, N.J., said she had felt ``disconnected'' from Judaism
because she was not religiously observant.
</P>
<P>
	   Before the program, she knew very few of her fellow Jewish college students
and rarely made it to synagogue.
</P>
<P>
	   This trip ``made me understand that it is more about an identity of
belonging to a people than just a belief in God,'' she said. ``I feel that a
whole new world has just opened up to me.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alarmed by intermarriage rates of 40 percent in the United States, the
project's donors hope to target unaffiliated students like Oser.
</P>
<P>
	   Billionaire Charles Bronfman, who helped launch and fund the project, hopes
to encourage Jews to marry Jewish by instilling participants with a sense of
heritage that will continue when they return home.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Our job is to see to it that a society that has done so well materially
and every other way voluntarily wants to stay Jewish,'' Bronfman told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   The money pays for airfare and 10 days of educational programs in Israel for
any Jewish person in the world between the ages of 15 and 26. Most students in
the launch group came from the United States, but there were others from
Australia, the former Soviet Union and Latin America.
</P>
<P>
	   But not everyone thinks the money is well-spent. Some Jewish leaders say
heritage is better preserved by investing in Jewish schools and summer camps in
the Diaspora.
</P>
<P>
	   Israelis are shocked by their own government's pledge of $70 million to the
program over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel, built largely by contributions from the Diaspora, is used to
receiving donations from overseas Jews -- not giving them.
</P>
<P>
	   Bronfman, however, said the trip could form the cornerstone for a renewed
sense of identity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The soul of the Jewish people is in Jerusalem,'' he said. ``It always has
been and always will be.''

<HEADLINE> Bradley Scores With Farmers  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CRESTON, Iowa (AP) -- His shiny black shoe propped on a livestock pen rail
smeared with mud and manure, Bill Bradley had an applause-winning answer for
every agriculture question thrown at him. Farmers walked out smiling.
</P>
<P>
	   The exchange at the auction house in sleepy Creston was part of an almost
Jekyll-and-Hyde performance by Bradley on Sunday as the Democratic presidential
candidate tried to keep criticism of his agriculture record from pushing him
farther behind Vice President Al Gore in this farm state.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's two-day bus tour through southwest Iowa was soured from the start
by Gore's dredging up of Bradley votes in the Senate against some emergency aid
to farmers and ethanol subsidies dear to corn growers.
</P>
<P>
	   At a sendoff outside his Des Moines campaign headquarters, Bradley lashed
out at Gore in a raised voice. And he later complained to reporters, ``He's
going around saying I don't have a good record on agriculture policy.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The administration doesn't have a leg to stand on. Where was Al Gore when
we needed a safety net'' for family farmers suffering their worst economic
downturn in a decade, Bradley asked.
</P>
<P>
	   Creston voters heard none of Bradley's complaints about Gore, only a stump
speech newly swollen with talk about the plight of small farmers and specific
aid proposals -- including a new ``Made on a family farm'' label that Bradley
said could add cachet to the products of family farmers the same way designer
labels make blue jeans more appealing.
</P>
<P>
	   By his last appearance of the day, in Council Bluffs, farm policy
disappeared altogether from Bradley's speech and he gamely answered for two high
school girls the same two questions he recently declined in a Wall Street
Journal survey -- his favorite movie recently (``The Green Mile'') and of all
time (``The Loneliness of the Long-distance Runner'').
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley later joked with the girls that he'd been putting them on with the
latter answer.
</P>
<P>
	   The only sign in Creston of a farm-policy problem for Bradley was in the
parking lot: A Gore campaign volunteer dressed as a giant ear of corn and
handing out indictments of the Bradley record.
</P>
<P>
	   Even then, the demonstrator's point was lost on some in Bradley's audience
who mistook him for an oversized pickle.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane noted that the vice president has proposed a
debate specifically on farm issues. ``If Senator Bradley is so interested in
agriculture why won't he debate Al Gore on agriculture?'' Lehane asked.
</P>
<P>
	   With two weeks to go before Iowa's delegate caucuses, Bradley is battling to
reduce Gore's 21-point lead in statewide polls.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said he's aiming to do at least as well here as Sen. Edward
Kennedy's losing 31 percent against Jimmy Carter in 1980. ``We have to do better
than expected,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   By Jan. 24, the caucus date, Bradley will have spent a whopping $1.4 million
on television advertising here -- a sum that campaign manager Gina Glantz said
was equivalent to Gore's Iowa ad expenses.
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore campaign, trying to heighten expectations for Bradley and thus
worsen his fall whatever vote percentage he gets, cites the ad sum as evidence
that Bradley is really out to win here.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley did tell voters gathered at a cafe in Indianola: ``On election
night, I want to surprise a lot of people not only in Iowa but in this
country.''

<HEADLINE> D.C. Weathers 'a Fiery Trial'  </HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- When the year 1800 opened, the straggling settlement on
the Potomac River was more map than city, more hope than reality.
</P>
<P>
	   Two hundred years ago this winter the embryo capital, soon to be called
Washington City, was a construction project with an uncertain future.
</P>
<P>
	   But real progress was finally being made against a November deadline. The
U.S. government intended to occupy the city as its permanent home by year's end.
</P>
<P>
	   George Washington, however, was gone. The retired first president had been
the chief patron of a capital on the Potomac. His unexpected death just days
before the new year opened removed the city's steadiest human pillar.
</P>
<P>
	   It also sent a shiver through the city's promoters, who feared that without
him, Congress would refuse to leave the comforts of civilized Philadelphia for a
scraggly landscape of ruts and tree stumps.
</P>
<P>
	   For George Washington, bringing the city this far had been ``a fiery
trial,'' a decade-long fight against greedy self-promoters, quarreling rivals,
shoddy workmanship and a laggard and miserly Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   For a struggling young republic, creating a wholly new city was an enormous
undertaking.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The founding of Washington was the moon shot, the Panama Canal of the
1790s,'' author Bob Arnebeck writes in ``Through a Fiery Trial, Building
Washington, 1790-1800.'' ``How ineptly the politicians, financiers, lawyers and
engineers managed the affair has been forgotten ...''
</P>
<P>
	   But it was all fresh for Isabella Clark, whose contractor husband had been
driven to ruin and madness while working on the city, She drew up a list of
Potomac villains, including ``French poltroons, dolts ..., quacks, bankrupts,
... speculators, monopolizers, extortioners, traitors (and) ham bricklayers.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Washington, who had kept an eye on the slowly rising city from his
retirement roost at nearby Mount Vernon, Va., concluded just days before his
death on Dec. 14, 1799, that the city had navigated the most dangerous eddies of
``local interest, destructive jealousies and inveterate prejudices.''
</P>
<P>
	   By the winter of 1800 it was time to take stock.
</P>
<P>
	   One wing of the Capitol would clearly be finished on time, down to the 16
columns of ``the ancient Ionic order'' on the facade. The rest of the building,
including the dome, would remain a paper monument for years.
</P>
<P>
	   The Treasury building was roofed and the woodwork and floors ready to
install. The War Department walls were up to street level.
</P>
<P>
	   Work on the President's House had been suspended for lack of ready cash, but
most of the interior woodwork was ready to go.
</P>
<P>
	   But there was much mud and no paved roads. A narrow stone footpath connected
the public buildings to the boarding houses where most members of Congress were
expected to live.
</P>
<P>
	   Amid the grumbling, the city's backers rekindled George Washington's spirit.
</P>
<P>
	   Nine days after his death, the House of Representatives voted to ask his
widow, Martha, to permit his body to be transferred to a marble memorial to be
erected under the still-unbuilt Capitol dome.
</P>
<P>
	   There was a major obstacle. Washington's will directed that his body rest
permanently in the family's Mount Vernon vault.
</P>
<P>
	   But on New Year's Eve, Martha Washington reluctantly agreed, sacrificing,
she said, her innermost feelings to ``a sense of public duty.''
</P>
<P>
	   For those seeking to move the hero's body practical concerns were at least
as important as patriotism and public duty.
</P>
<P>
	   Entombing Washington's remains in the Capitol would be ``a very great
inducement'' to finishing the building as planned, one advocate said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the shuffle of circumstances, Washington's body never left his native
Virginia. But a place in the Capitol was reserved for it for decades.
</P>
<P>
	   More practically, the city's commissioners worried that the house designated
for President John Adams was a ``naked, ugly-looking building.''
</P>
<P>
	   Adams sent word through his secretary that he hoped the mansion would be
quickly plastered and painted so ``that it may be perfectly dry when he takes
possession.''
</P>
<P>
	   Abigail Adams confessed she was discouraged at the prospects of living in a
house described as ``like to be uncomfortably cold, situated (away) from all
society (and) without furniture.''
</P>
<P>
	   As the winter turned into spring, walls rose, floors were laid, windows were
glazed and buildings were completed. Much of the work was done by slaves hired
from local masters.
</P>
<P>
	   Confidence rose that the new capital might endure and one day prosper.
</P>
<P>
	   ''1800 was the year of the city's destiny,'' Arnebeck wrote. ``And there was
preparation to meet it.''

<HEADLINE> Study: Older Americans Avoid Crime  </HEADLINE>
   By MICHAEL J. SNIFFEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Elderly Americans are far less likely than younger men
and women to be attacked by violent criminals, and the Justice Department says
it may well be because older people stay home at night more often.
</P>
<P>
	   Each year from 1992 through 1997, there were an average of 5.3 violent
crimes for every 1,000 U.S. residents aged 65 or older, the department's Bureau
of Justice Statistics said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   That was less than one-tenth the rate of violent attacks on younger
Americans; those aged 12-64 suffered an annual average of 56 violent attacks for
every 1,000 residents during each of the same six years.
</P>
<P>
	   The data was based on Census Bureau interviews every six months during the
period with 85,000 Americans 12 and older. In 1997, the elderly, defined by the
report as those 65 or older, made up 12.7 percent of the U.S. population but
accounted for only 7 percent of the crime victims identified in the interviews.
</P>
<P>
	   The report's author, statistician Patsy A. Klaus, said differences in
lifestyle appeared to play a major role in the incidence of violent crime.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Elderly victims of nonlethal violence were less likely than younger
victims to go out at night,'' she wrote. About 22 percent of elderly violence
victims reported they never went out at night for entertainment, shopping or
other activities. By comparison, only 3 percent of violence victims under age 50
stayed home at night.
</P>
<P>
	   Klaus also found that the elderly were less likely than younger people to
fight back when attacked. Only 49 percent of elderly violence victims reported
arguing with the assailant, running away, calling for help or attacking the
offender. By comparison, more than 70 percent of those under age 50 took some
self-protective step.
</P>
<P>
	   Crimes against the elderly were more likely to occur in or near their homes
and in the day rather than the night, compared with crimes against younger
victims. Among elderly victims of violent crime, 70 percent of the attacks
occurred in daytime. For all younger victims, daylight attacks comprised less
than 60 percent of the total, and for those aged 25-49 less than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Violent attacks near home represented 43 percent of those against the
elderly, but only 26 percent of those against younger people.
</P>
<P>
	   The elderly had lower victimization rates than younger people for every type
of violent and property crime measured by the victimization interviews: rape,
robbery, aggravated assault, simple assault, household burglary, auto theft and
theft.
</P>
<P>
	   The Census Bureau does no victimization interviews in institutions, so
crimes against people in nursing homes are not counted in the estimates, the
Justice Department noted. In 1995, 4 percent of the elderly, or 1.4 million
people 65 or older, were in nursing homes or long-term care institutions.
</P>
<P>
	   The interviews also do not cover fraud and thus do not measure the high rate
at which elderly people are victimized by crooked telemarketers.
</P>
<P>
	   Of all crimes reported by older people during the six-year period, 92
percent were property crimes, compared with 72 percent for younger Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   During the study period, the elderly suffered an annual average of 2.5
million burglaries, thefts and auto thefts; 46,090 purse snatchings or pocket
pickings, 165,330 non-lethal violent crimes and 1,000 murders. The murder data
comes from FBI statistics reported by police departments.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the annual average of 165,330 older people who suffered non-lethal
violence, 22 percent were injured and 6 percent received treatment at a
hospital. Among victims of violence, the rate of serious injury -- gunshots and
stab wounds, broken bones, unconsciousness -- was about the same, 13 percent,
for the elderly as for the overall population.

<HEADLINE> Australia Won't Reopen Nazi Case  </HEADLINE>
   By ROHAN SULLIVAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The Australian government on Monday defended its
decision not to reopen an investigation into Nazi war crimes suspect Konrad
Kalejs.
</P>
<P>
	   Kalejs, 68, a Latvian-born Australian citizen, went into hiding after
returning to Australia last Friday. He had been living in Britain, but left to
avoid deportation proceedings there.
</P>
<P>
	   The Simon Wiesenthal Center, which searches the world for suspected former
Nazis, has said Kalejs served in the notorious Arajs Kommando, a Nazi killing
squad responsible for the death of 30,000 people, mostly Jews, in Latvia during
World War II. He has denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   Under increasing pressure to put Kalejs on trial or change laws so he can be
deported to Latvia, Justice Minister Amanda Vanstone warned Monday that if the
government acted without strong new evidence it could jeopardize any future
prosecution by exempting the suspect from retrial.
</P>
<P>
	   Evidence gathered by agencies including the U.S. Office of Special
Investigations and Australia's now-disbanded war crimes unit has led to
deportation proceedings in the United States, Canada and Britain.
</P>
<P>
	   But to seek criminal charges, those countries would have needed evidence
showing a higher standard of proof than they needed for deportation.
</P>
<P>
	   The Daily Telegraph newspaper of Sydney on Monday published a photograph it
said was taken in 1942 of Kalejs wearing the uniform of a Nazi SS auxiliary.
</P>
<P>
	   Australian newspapers also printed excerpts from a Nazi propaganda
newsletter dated June 5, 1942, in which someone said to be Kalejs describes
taking part in attacks on Soviet-held villages.
</P>
<P>
	   Vanstone warned that if charges were laid and Kalejs was acquitted, he could
never be tried in Australia again and could not be extradited on those charges.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If you believe someone is really guilty ... you don't only want a trial,
you want them convicted,'' Vanstone said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
	   The Latvian government said it would seek Kalejs' extradition from Australia
immediately if new evidence of war crimes was uncovered. The two governments
have begun talks on an extradition treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   In his only interview since returning to Australia, Kalejs told the Special
Broadcasting Service that he was an officer in the Arajs Kommando.
</P>
<P>
	   But he denied he was ever present when civilians were shot. ``Never, never
... I never participated in anything like that,'' Kalejs said in the interview,
which was conducted in Latvian and translated by SBS.
</P>
<P>
	   Kalejs said he was a student in Latvia before being told by German generals
in 1942 that he would be placed in command of a unit of Latvian soldiers.
</P>
<P>
	   Kalejs said he discovered later that the soldiers were members of the Arajs
Kommando. He said he only briefly met the commando's leader, Viktor Arajs, who
was charged in 1948 with mass killings and later sentenced by a German court to
life in prison. Arajs died in jail.

Australia Won't Reopen Nazi Case
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The Australian government on Monday defended its
decision not to reopen an investigation into Nazi war crimes suspect Konrad
Kalejs. Kalejs, 68, a Latvian-born Australian citizen, went into hiding after
returning to Australia last Friday. The Simon Wiesenthal Center, which searches
the world for suspected former Nazis, has said Kalejs served in the notorious
Arajs Kommando, a Nazi killing squad responsible for the death of 30,000 people,
mostly Jews, in Latvia during World War II. He has denied the allegations.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Syrian Talks Winding Down  </HEADLINE>
   By DONNA ABU-NASR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- Peace talks between Israel and Syria dwindled
down to an inconclusive recess, with President Clinton trying to narrow
differences in what his spokesman called ``difficult and complex'' issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Today was to be the last working day in which the Israeli and Syrian
delegation leaders would participate. It was not clear whether the four working
groups of experts handling the technical negotiations would stay behind.
</P>
<P>
	   An administration official said Clinton was unlikely to return to
Shepherdstown today.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Clearly we are coming to the end of the leaders' participation here this
week,'' State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said he did not expect an agreement to emerge but that Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk al-Sharaa were likely to
meet again ``sooner rather than later.''
</P>
<P>
	   Barak was making plans to depart for home later today. Al-Sharaa was likely
to follow on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, Clinton renewed his efforts to energize the talks, returning to
the negotiating site 70 miles northwest of Washington for the fifth time in the
weeklong negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is an ongoing process. The issues are difficult and complex,'' said
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
	   The president brought together Barak and al-Sharaa for their third
face-to-face meeting, this time over a 2 1/2-hour dinner at the National
Conservation Training Center during which the Israeli and Syrian leaders broke
bread together for the first time. The leaders enjoyed a meal of tenderloin of
beef with morel sauce, along with chardonnay and merlot wines.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton later held separate meetings with al-Sharaa and Barak.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin said Clinton felt that ``it was a very good and serious exchange of
views'' and all issues came up at dinner.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was a fairly warm atmosphere,'' the spokesman added. ``It was pretty
cordial.''
</P>
<P>
	   A source close to the Syrian delegation said the trilateral meeting focused
on the work of the four committees, especially the border committee.
</P>
<P>
	   The source said al-Sharaa told Clinton the function of that panel was the
demarcation of borders and not again discussing withdrawal proposals.
</P>
<P>
	   Al-Sharaa said that Syria stands by its demand that Israel pull back to the
June 4, 1967, border and that Damascus will not compromise on the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Committees met Sunday on all the key issues -- the demarcation of borders,
security arrangements, normal peaceful relations and water sharing.
</P>
<P>
	   The State Department's Rubin said the seven-page document could become the
basis for an eventual ``core agreement.'' But he said Israel and Syria still
faced ``enormous decisions'' and ``we don't expect those decisions to be made in
a matter of days,''
</P>
<P>
	   American mediators had not offered ``bridging proposals'' designed to close
the gap where the two sides were in disagreement, Rubin added.

<HEADLINE> Afrikaners Urged To Join ANC  </HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW SELSKY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- During apartheid, the world came to know
Pik Botha as a defender of white rule. Now, the former foreign minister
describes Nelson Mandela as a great man and expresses interest in joining his
African National Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Since the 1994 all-race elections ended white rule, several high-profile
members of the National Party have defected.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think I can associate myself with (the ANC's) fundamental principles,''
Botha told South African Broadcasting Corp. today. ``All of us changed. The
present day ANC is not the ANC that was when we were in conflict with each
other.''
</P>
<P>
	   On Sunday, he was quoted in a Johannesburg newspaper as saying: ``Whites,
especially the Afrikaners, must get down from their pedestals.''
</P>
<P>
	   For some, it may be an awakening to new moral values. For others, it is
simple pragmatism. The National Party did poorly in elections last year and
faces possible extinction as whites split their votes among a handful of
opposition groups.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The National Party is gone ... its history is just too heavy,'' said Roelf
Meyer, a former top National Party official who resigned in 1997 and formed the
United Democratic Movement.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the latest converts is Botha, who as the apartheid state's foreign
minister for 17 years defended the system in international forums. Botha is now
urging other Afrikaners -- the descendants of European settlers who largely
supported the National Party -- to support the ANC, although he has ruled out
any active political role for himself.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The process of healthy political regrouping and restructuring will only
start when Afrikaners join the ANC,'' Botha said Sunday, adding that he liked
the ruling party's policies of freedom of speech and religion, and the
protection of private property.
</P>
<P>
	   In the interview with City Press, he took a few shots at F.W. de Klerk, the
country's last apartheid-era president.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mandela succeeded in his bid to reach out to whites without bitterness. De
Klerk did not manage to reach out to blacks,'' Botha was quoted as saying. Botha
also said there was a higher level of debate in Mandela's Cabinet than in de
Klerk's.
</P>
<P>
	   After the ANC won the 1994 elections, Botha served in Mandela's government
of national unity for two years as Cabinet minister of minerals and energy. When
de Klerk, who was deputy president in the unity government, pulled out, Botha
followed suit and largely disappeared from public view.
</P>
<P>
	   The 67-year-old Botha's reappearance in recent interviews indicated a
transformation. But it was not so surprising for a man who had begun moderating
his views on apartheid in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1986, Botha was criticized in National Party circles when he expressed
his belief that South Africa might one day have a black leader.
</P>
<P>
	   In City Press, Botha said he thought Mandela's successor, President Thabo
Mbeki, was continuing with the process of racial reconciliation that Mandela
started.

<HEADLINE> Florida at Center of NFL Universe  </HEADLINE>
    By BARRY WILNER AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Thanks to some old-time heroics from Dan Marino, all three NFL teams from
Florida will be in the playoffs next weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   Marino guided Miami on an 85-yard drive to J.J. Johnson's 2-yard touchdown
run with 4:48 left at Seattle, giving the Dolphins a 20-17 victory. A superb
defensive effort in which Trace Armstrong had three of the team's six sacks also
was decisive.
</P>
<P>
	   That sent the Dolphins (10-7), the lowest AFC qualifier, to Jacksonville
(14-2) on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Tampa, the other Florida team, and Jacksonville had a bye this week. The
Buccaneers (11-5) are at home against Washington, also on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   Minnesota beat Dallas 27-10 in the early game Sunday to secure a spot at St.
Louis in the next round. The Vikings (11-6) and Rams (13-3) will play next
Sunday, followed by Tennessee, fresh from the Music City Miracle, at
Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans (14-3) stunned Buffalo 22-16 on a desperation lateral-kickoff
runback for a touchdown with three seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Washington advanced with a 27-13 win over Detroit.
</P>
<P>
	   Marino was 4-for-7 for 84 yards on the decisive drive, including completions
of 23 yards to Tony Martin on third-and-17 from his 8, and a 24-yard third-down
completion to Oronde Gadsden at the 5, setting up Johnson's game-winner. It was
Miami's first postseason road victory since 1972.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a big win for this team to come all the way to Seattle and play in
front of a hostile crowd," said Marino, 38 and the NFL career passing leader.
"It's as loud as it gets here in the Kingdome. We just had to be patient."
</P>
<P>
	   It won't be loud in the Kingdome anymore -- it's being torn down.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami's defense certainly quieted the crowd with its sacks.
</P>
<P>
	   "I've had a bunch of twos," the 34-year-old Armstrong said. "But not many
like this."
</P>
<P>
	   Seattle, which was 8-2, finished 9-8. It got an 85-yard kickoff runback for
a TD by Charlie Rogers.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeff George got his first postseason win in his second playoff game in 10
years.
</P>
<P>
	   George threw TD passes of 26 yards to Robert Smith, 58 yards to Randy Moss
and 5 yards to Cris Carter. Smith, capitalizing on Dallas' concerns with the
passing game, rushed for 140 yards, breaking his team playoff record of 124
yards set last year.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a great feeling to be able to go out there and run the ball as
effectively as we did," Smith said. "It is what we love to do, myself and the
linemen included. Those guys love running the football and I obviously love
having the ball in my hands."
</P>
<P>
	   Dallas dropped four of its last six and wound up 8-9.
</P>
<P>
	   "Eight-and-nine, mediocre, up and down, nothing consistent, consistently bad
at times," said Emmitt Smith, who gained 99 yards to give him the career playoff
rushing record, surpassing Franco Harris.
</P>
<P>
	   The first playoff game in the brand new Adelphia Coliseum will be hard to
top, thanks to "Home Run Throwback."
</P>
<P>
	   After Al Del Greco gave Tennessee a 15-13 lead with 1:48 remaining on a
36-yard field goals, the Bills (11-6) marched back to get Steve Christie's
41-yarder with 16 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   The Titans then turned to the wild kick return play, on which Frank Wycheck,
after taking a handoff of the short kickoff from Lorenzo Neal, moved right and
threw to the left sideline. It was a lateral -- barely, as instant replay
indicated -- caught by Dyson, who then sped down the sideline for the winning
score with 3 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   "I made sure I got behind him," Dyson said of the lateral. "I took one hard
to step to make sure it was a lateral. Once I caught it, I thought, 'Get a
touchdown or at least good position for a field goal."
</P>
<P>
	   Mission accomplished.
</P>
<P>
	   Detroit (8-9) still hasn't won in Washington, where it now is 0-20. It
hasn't won in the playoffs on the road since 1957.
</P>
<P>
	   A major reason the Lions headed home was Stephen Davis, the NFC's leading
rusher who overcame a sore knee and ankle to run for 119 yards and two
touchdowns. The Redskins won their first playoff appearance in seven years as
their maligned defense had five sacks, two by Sam Shade.
</P>
<P>
	   Davis and center Cory Raymer are doubtful for next weekend, while left
tackle Andy Heck is already ruled out and guard Tre Johnson could face a
suspension for striking a referee during a scuffle with the Lions.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's very, very scary," coach Norv Turner said. "We've been fortunate to go
through the season with great health."

<HEADLINE> Vikings 27, Cowboys 10  </HEADLINE>
    By ARNIE STAPLETON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Emmitt Smith broke the NFL's career playoff rushing
record. Robert Smith broke tackle after tackle until he finally broke the Dallas
Cowboys' spirit.
</P>
<P>
	   Robert Smith rushed for team playoff record 140 yards and turned a screen
pass into a 26-yard touchdown Sunday as the Vikings beat the Cowboys 27-10 in a
wild card game.
</P>
<P>
	   The Vikings (11-6) will travel to St. Louis for a second-round divisional
game against the top-seeded Rams.
</P>
<P>
	   Dallas (8-9) lost its eighth straight road game, in large part because
Robert Smith is finally fully recovered from a midseason double hernia
operation, making the Vikings more than just a passing threat.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is the only time this year where he's been healthy," Vikings coach
Dennis Green said. "He's a stronger player right now. His upper body is
stronger, his legs are stronger. He feels great, he feels frisky. He knows he
can break tackles and he knows he can also use his speed. He wants the ball."
</P>
<P>
	   And the Vikings were more than happy to oblige, especially with the Cowboys
concentrating their coverage on Randy Moss and Cris Carter, both of whom still
managed to catch touchdown passes from Jeff George.
</P>
<P>
	   Smith, who also had 58 yards on three catches, broke his own team playoff
record of 124 yards rushing that he set last season.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a great feeling to be able to go out there and run the ball as
effectively as we did," Smith said. "It is what we love to do, myself and the
linemen included. Those guys love running the football, and I obviously love
having the ball in my hands."
</P>
<P>
	   Not surprisingly, two of the game's most crucial plays involved Robert
Smith.
</P>
<P>
	   The Vikings trailed 10-3 with 9:21 left in the second quarter and faced
third-and-25 at the Dallas 26 when George couldn't find a receiver open
downfield, so he dumped it off to Smith in the left flat.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know if he knew I was coming to him, but he was all I had," said
George, who won his first playoff game in his eventful 10-year NFL career. "You
just get it in his hands and let him do his magic."
</P>
<P>
	   Smith was shocked.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was surprising because we had run the play in practice this week, and he
had never looked my way," Smith said. "I was just basically running down the
sideline as a decoy. He saw there was nobody out there and as soon as I turned
around, the ball was there."
</P>
<P>
	   Smith, who didn't play against Dallas in November, juked George Teague to
the ground at the 10 and sauntered into the end zone behind a block from Carter.
</P>
<P>
	   That tied it 10-10, and it appeared the Vikings would settle for that score
at halftime when they called for Smith to run a draw play on third-and-12 from
their own 28 with less than a minute left.
</P>
<P>
	   But Smith gained 14 yards, and after a timeout, George hit Moss for a
58-yard score with 28 seconds left in the half for a 17-10 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   "They had one play: draw. That's the only thing we gave up," Cowboys
linebacker Randall Godfrey said. "The third-and-12 play was huge. They don't
make it and they probably don't score."
</P>
<P>
	   George hit Carter with a 5-yard TD -- the only catch of the day for the
Vikings' only All-Pro player -- early in the fourth quarter to cap the scoring,
which included field goals of 47 and 38 yards by Gary Anderson.
</P>
<P>
	   George lost his only other playoff game, at Green Bay in 1995 when he was
with the Atlanta Falcons, one of three teams that ran him out of town before he
salvaged his career in Minnesota, where he is 9-2 as the starter.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's been a long time coming," George said. "But it's just one game. Our
goal is just like everyone else's. We want to win a championship."
</P>
<P>
	   In the first quarter, Emmitt Smith, who ripped through a porous Minnesota
defense in November for 140 yards and two touchdowns in just 1 1/2 quarters
before breaking a hand, broke free for a 65-yard run. Kenny Wright chased him
down at the 3, saving a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
	   The Vikings stuffed Smith twice and Troy Aikman overthrew David LaFleur, so
the Cowboys settled for Eddie Murray's 18-yard field goal and a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Aikman completed passes of 45 and 25 yards to Raghib Ismail on a 79-yard
drive Smith capped with a 5-yard cutback run for a 10-3 lead. Smith's 21st
playoff TD tied Thurman Thomas' NFL record. Smith also surpassed Franco Harris'
playoff record of 1,556 yards rushing on the score.
</P>
<P>
	   He finished with 99 yards and 1,586 yards. But that was of little
consolation.
</P>
<P>
	   "Eight-and-nine, mediocre, up and down, nothing consistent, consistently bad
at times," Smith said of the Cowboys' roller coaster season. "Showing some signs
of brilliance and being a very good ballclub, but a team that couldn't put it
all together."

<HEADLINE> Jags Get Dolphins Instead of Titans  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE GOLDBERG AP Football Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Someone is sure to say the Jacksonville Jaguars dodged a bullet Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   They didn't. They dodged the team that handed them their only two losses
this season -- the Tennessee Titans.
</P>
<P>
	   That happened when Miami, the sixth seed in the AFC, won 20-17 in Seattle,
meaning the Dolphins travel to top-seeded but banged-up Jacksonville on
Saturday, while the Titans, who at 14-3 are a lot better than their fourth seed,
play at second-seeded Indianapolis on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   In the NFC, the seeds held. No 3 Washington will be at No. 2 Tampa Bay on
Saturday, with No. 4 Minnesota at No. 1 St. Louis on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   In order of appearance:
</P>
<P>
	   A lot depends on the health of Jags quarterback Mark Brunell, who sat out
the last regular-season game with a sprained knee, but it expected back for this
one. And a lot depends on how the Jags' offensive line, with Tony Boselli gone
for the season, manages to protect Brunell, who at best will be less mobile than
usual.
</P>
<P>
	   That's because the Dolphins' defense, one of the league's best as Miami went
7-1 in the first half of the season, reasserted itself Sunday in Seattle after a
poor second half. It sacked John Kitna six times and it might do the same to
Brunell without Boselli to protect him.
</P>
<P>
	   That could mean a quick game as the Jaguars try to run Fred Taylor to take
pressure off Brunell, and the Dolphins try to run because that's what Jimmy
Johnson wants to do. And it means more of a load on the improved Jacksonville
defense.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, the Jaguars have more firepower, even injured. A hobbling but
protected Brunell should be able to find Jimmy Smith and Keenan McCardell.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jags also are home, although there might be Miami fans left over in
north Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   Jacksonville probably survives.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking of injuries ...
</P>
<P>
	   Washington could be without four important offensive starters, including
running back Stephen Davis and Pro Bowl guard Tre Johnson.
</P>
<P>
	   Davis, the NFC's leading rusher, is doubtful with a knee injury, and center
Cory Raymer and left tackle Andy Heck already has been ruled out. Johnson could
be suspended for striking an official during a fight in Saturday's 27-13 win
over Detroit, but the Redskins are hoping for just a fine.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a very, very scary situation," coach Norv Turner said.
</P>
<P>
	   This all plays into the hands of Tampa Bay's strength -- its defense.
</P>
<P>
	   Even if Johnson plays, there will probably be two backups on the Washington
offensive line to face Warren Sapp and friends, meaning Washington's improving
but shaky defense will have to carry a bigger load.
</P>
<P>
	   It has one edge. Shaun King has played decently at quarterback for the Bucs,
but he's still a rookie, and rookies normally don't go very far in the playoffs.
If Johnson isn't suspended and Turner can get a running game from the
combination of Skip Hicks, Brian Mitchell and Larry Centers, this could be
tight.
</P>
<P>
	   This is the matchup everyone wants to see -- two explosive offenses in a
47-46 game.
</P>
<P>
	   The quarterbacks are intriguing -- Jeff George in his first major playoff
run and Kurt Warner in his first playoff game. Yes, Warner is the NFL's MVP, but
he's still a playoff rookie.
</P>
<P>
	   There are other mirrors -- Robert Smith vs. Marshall Faulk at running back
and Randy Moss, Cris Carter and Jake Reed vs. Isaac Bruce, Torry Holt and
Az-Zahir Hakim at wide receiver. Give Faulk and the Vikings' receivers slight
edges.
</P>
<P>
	   But there are two big edges for the Rams.
</P>
<P>
	   One is the HomeDome -- the Vikings will get the same treatment visitors get
when they come to Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
	   The second is defense. Like Washington's, Minnesota's has improved in the
last few weeks. But St. Louis' has been good all year, although it's overlooked.
If noise bothers the Vikings' offensive line, George will see a lot of Kevin
Carter.
</P>
<P>
	   Edge to the Rams.
</P>
<P>
	   Thanks to the Music City Miracle, the Titans have their second life. Now
they have to take advantage of it.
</P>
<P>
	   They probably would have preferred the Jaguars, whom they beat 41-14 three
weeks ago simply because the KNOW they can beat them.
</P>
<P>
	   But while they won't stop Peyton Manning, Edgerrin James, Marvin Harrison
and the rest of the Indianapolis offense, they have the weapons to slow it down.
Watch Jevon Kearse, who could have an easier time against massive but not too
mobile left tackle Tarik Glenn than against the quicker right tackle, Adam
Meadows.
</P>
<P>
	   On the other hand, Tennessee will need more from Steve McNair, who threw
deep just once against Buffalo on Saturday. With Cornelius Bennett, the glue of
the Colts' defense, probably out with a knee injury, McNair also should get more
room to scramble.
</P>
<P>
	   Bennett's loss is a big problem on a young Indy defense.
</P>
<P>
	   Slight edge to Tennessee, which just might get a third shot at Jacksonville
in the AFC title game.

<HEADLINE> Skins May Face Bucs Without Davis  </HEADLINE>
    By JOSEPH WHITE AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ASHBURN, Va. (AP) -- Imagine having two seldom-used offensive linemen and no
power runner on the field against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' fearsome defense.
</P>
<P>
	   That's the scenario the Washington Redskins might face Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's very, very scary," coach Norv Turner said. "We've been fortunate to go
through the season with great health."
</P>
<P>
	   Not any more.
</P>
<P>
	   Stephen Davis, the NFC's leading rusher, and center Cory Raymer are
classified as "doubtful," and left tackle Andy Heck is already ruled out for the
divisional playoff game at Tampa.
</P>
<P>
	   Davis sat in the basement of Redskin Park on Sunday with ice on his left
ankle and right knee. He sprained the ankle three weeks ago at Indianapolis and
made his return in Saturday's 27-13 first-round victory over Detroit. He wasn't
100 percent, but he ran for 119 yards and two touchdowns before spraining a knee
ligament when his leg was hooked by defensive tackle Dan Owens five minutes into
the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if he'll be able to play against Tampa Bay, Davis said: "I'll be ready
-- hopefully."
</P>
<P>
	   Turner also tried to be hopeful, but he threw in a heavy dash of realism.
</P>
<P>
	   "Stephen says the right things," Turner said. "He certainly wants to play.
I'm an optimist and think he'll play, hope he'll play. Medically, the problems
have been doubled. His ankle is sore from playing on it, and his knee is sore. I
think he's sorer than he's letting on. There's a reason we're listing him
doubtful."
</P>
<P>
	   Davis rushed for 1,405 yards this season, made the Pro Bowl and averaged 4.8
yards per carry. His backup, Skip Hicks, rushed for 257 yards, averaged 3.3
yards and lacks Davis' vision when it comes to following his blockers. In
Saturday's game, Davis averaged 7.9 yards on 15 carries, Hicks just 2.0 on 23
carries for 46 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   Heck suffered a torn hamstring on an extra-point attempt in the first
quarter. He was on crutches Sunday and is probably done for the season.
</P>
<P>
	   His backup is fifth-year tackle Kipp Vickers, who actually started a playoff
game with Indianapolis four years ago. Vickers also started six regular-season
games for the Colts in 1996, but hasn't started a game since. He was used
sparingly in 11 of 16 regular-season games this season.
</P>
<P>
	   "He doesn't have the experience Andy has, but one thing is, he's very
physical in the running game," Turner said.
</P>
<P>
	   Turner said he will play Vickers ahead of Brad Badger, who moved from guard
to start 10 games at left tackle last season in an experiment that didn't work.
</P>
<P>
	   Raymer's situation is the most muddled. He pulled a muscle in the right side
of his rib cage and stayed in the game. Turner said he felt Raymer would be
fine, but trainer Bubba Tyer was much more cautious.
</P>
<P>
	   "He'd be doubtful today," Tyer said. "But we'll just take him day to day."
</P>
<P>
	   Raymer's backup is Mark Fischer, a second-year center who has never played
an offensive snap in the NFL. He was used on special teams for six games last
season and has not played at all this season.
</P>
<P>
	   There's an outside chance the Redskins could lose a fourth starter. Pro Bowl
guard Tre Johnson will almost certainly be fined by the league for striking an
official in the head during a fight in the second half of the victory over the
Lions, and a suspension is also possible.
</P>
<P>
	   "It certainly wasn't intentional," Turner said. "It was poor judgment on
Tre's part, and from everything I've heard it would be a case of being fined."
</P>
<P>
	   The Redskins have been one of the healthiest teams in the NFL this season,
one of the big reasons they went 10-6 and won the NFC East. They lost only 11
man-games due to injuries -- nine on offense, two on defense. Five of those came
when guard Keith Smith had a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
	   Now disaster has hit all at once, and it came amid the joyous celebrations
of a victory in the franchise's first playoff game in seven years.
</P>
<P>
	   Tampa Bay is ranked third in total defense. Four linemen -- Warren Sapp,
Marcus Jones, Chidi Ahanotu, Brad Culpepper -- have six sacks or more.
</P>
<P>
	   "Their defensive front, it's so quick, so fast," Turner said. "They've got
an outstanding blitz package. If you're not ready to play, it can be humbling."

<HEADLINE> Dolphins 20, Seahawks 17  </HEADLINE>
    By STEVEN WINE AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- Dan Marino's last game could be three weeks away.
</P>
<P>
	   "If he wins the Super Bowl, he's done," said his agent, Marvin Demoff. "If
that happens, I think everyone would like to see him retire."
</P>
<P>
	   Marino moved one win closer to his first championship ring Sunday, leading
the Miami Dolphins to a 20-17 victory over the Seattle Seahawks in an AFC
wild-card playoff game.
</P>
<P>
	   The victory temporarily delayed questions whether Marino, 38, will retire.
Instead, the question becomes how far the sentimental favorite in these playoffs
can go.
</P>
<P>
	   "Maybe Dan will get the Super Bowl ring he deserves to cap off a great
career," Seattle quarterback Jon Kitna said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dolphins, who earned their first road playoff victory since 1972, still
face a tough path to the title game. They play Saturday at Jacksonville (14-2)
and would also be on the road in the AFC championship game.
</P>
<P>
	   "If we win two more, we've got a shot," Marino said.
</P>
<P>
	   He won Sunday by playing exactly the way Jimmy Johnson wants. There was no
sign of the simmering discord between quarterback and coach, and both credited a
conservative game plan for the victory.
</P>
<P>
	   Marino handed off more than he passed and -- for only the fourth time this
season -- he threw no interceptions.
</P>
<P>
	   "We talked about running the ball, and we ran it a lot," the most prolific
passer in NFL history said. "We wanted to play good defense, not turn it over
and have a chance to win at the end. It worked out perfect."
</P>
<P>
	   But Miami (10-7) needed a little Marino magic in the final quarter to pull
out the victory. With nine minutes left and the Dolphins trailing 17-13, he went
4-for-7 for 84 yards on a drive that produced the decisive touchdown.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense did the rest. Trace Armstrong had three of Miami's six sacks, and
Seattle (9-8) totaled only 32 yards in the second half.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have no clue as to how they were able to push us around like they did,"
Seahawks running back Ricky Watters said. "They controlled us and really handled
us. They made us look pretty bad."
</P>
<P>
	   Miami's fourth-quarter comeback was the 37th of Marino's career.
</P>
<P>
	   "Dan did a great job of executing the plan," Johnson said. "And he did a
great job of throwing the ball."
</P>
<P>
	   Marino and Johnson have clashed repeatedly this season over the
quarterback's play, and tension between them has fueled speculation that both
will retire after this season.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's not an easy relationship," Demoff said while watching the game from
the press box. "But they can work together without being best friends."
</P>
<P>
	   They proved it Sunday. Johnson, annoyed by Marino's risky decisions and 17
interceptions this season, was delighted that a cautious attack rolled up 108
yards rushing against Seattle and controlled the ball for nearly 35 minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Marino finished 17-for-30 for a modest 196 yards.
</P>
<P>
	   "I know Dan probably wants to hang back there and wing it a little more,"
Johnson said, "but it helps to run for 100 yards."
</P>
<P>
	   Marino completed his first pass for 17 yards, but the Dolphins netted just 6
yards through the air the rest of the first half. Once Miami even ran on
third-and-6 at midfield.
</P>
<P>
	   The conservative strategy produced five first downs in the opening half and
a 10-3 deficit for the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
	   "There were some situations where we could have thrown it more," Marino
said. "But we wanted to wait."
</P>
<P>
	   "We knew we were going to pound and pound," receiver Oronde Gadsden said.
"Then the safeties come up and you get one-on-one coverage, and that plays into
Dan's hands."
</P>
<P>
	   Marino began throwing more on the opening series of the second half, and a
60-yard drive ended with his 1-yard touchdown pass to Gadsden, making the score
10-10. Seattle regained the lead when rookie Charlie Rogers returned the ensuing
kickoff 85 yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
	   The game's pivotal play came with 8:26 left and the Dolphins trailing 17-13.
On third-and-17 at the Miami 8, Marino hit Tony Martin for 23 yards to start the
winning drive. He later hit Gadsden on third-and-10 for 24 yards to set up the
touchdown.
</P>
<P>
	   Marino said he never considered the possibility that the possession could be
the last of his career if the Dolphins were stopped.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's so much going on, with crowd noise and everything, I'm not that
smart," he said. "I'm worried about just trying to win."

<HEADLINE> Tiger Wins Mercedes Championship  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUG FERGUSON AP Golf Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KAPALUA, Hawaii (AP) -- Ernie Els, a two-time U.S. Open champion with
something to prove, had only two holes worse than par all week, made eagle on
the last hole to force a playoff and played better than anyone from tee to
green.
</P>
<P>
	   It still wasn't enough to beat Tiger Woods in the Mercedes Championship.
</P>
<P>
	   Picking up where he left off last year, Woods won his fifth straight PGA
Tour event on Sunday in a pulsating finish that featured two eagles on the 72nd
hole, two birdies on the first sudden-death hole and a 40-foot birdie putt no
one but Woods thought could go in.
</P>
<P>
	   "It feels a lot better when you can beat the best players," Woods said after
winning on the second extra hole. "I was fortunate enough to get him this time."
</P>
<P>
	   Gracious in defeat, Els was also stupefied.
</P>
<P>
	   "He does that quite a lot," the South African said of Woods' winning putt on
No. 1, a 40-footer with 2 1/2 feet of break. "He does it at the right time. A
bit of luck, but a lot of skill."
</P>
<P>
	   Els matched Woods' 5-under 68 in another blustery round on the Plantation
Course at Kapalua, matched his eagle on the 18th hole to get into the playoff,
and promptly joined a list that includes Phil Mickelson, Davis Love III and
Miguel Angel Jimenez.
</P>
<P>
	   All of them -- twice now for Els -- have fallen victim to golf's longest
streak in 46 years.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think he's a legend in the making, if he's not already," Els said. "I
think you guys have helped him a lot, but he's backed it up with his game. He's
24. He's probably going to be bigger than Elvis when he gets into his 40s."
</P>
<P>
	   Woods became the first player to win five straight tournaments since Ben
Hogan in 1953. His streak of five consecutive PGA Tour events is the longest
since Hogan won six straight in 1948. The tour doesn't recognize Hogan's streak
in '53 because it includes the British Open, which wasn't an official tour event
until 1995.
</P>
<P>
	   And by winning the Mercedes, Woods inched a little closer to a record deemed
untouchable in golf -- 11 in a row by Byron Nelson in 1945.
</P>
<P>
	   Next stop: most likely Pebble Beach in four weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Until then, the rest of the field will have a better chance to win because
Woods will be taking time off and -- get this -- working on his game.
</P>
<P>
	   That should also give everyone time to soak in all that Woods has become.
</P>
<P>
	   If he is a legend in the making, it only grew in a heart-stopping finish to
the first tournament of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods and Els finished four rounds in the fierce trade winds off the
Northeast coast of Maui in 11-under 276. Defending champion David Duval missed a
ton of birdie putts and also had a 68, four strokes back at 280.
</P>
<P>
	   There was other great golf Sunday. Mike Weir made five straight birdies on
the back nine for a 67 to tie for fourth at 285 with Jim Furyk. Carlos Franco
had the best score of the day, a 7-under 66, and was at 287.
</P>
<P>
	   But the final round belonged to Woods and Els, and they staged a terrific
show along the hilly terrain overlooking the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
	   Els, pounding his drives past Woods to show how determined he is to
challenge him this year, took a 1-stroke lead through the first nine holes, and
a 2-stroke swing on No. 10 -- Els missed the green and made a rare bogey, Wood
made a 5-foot birdie -- gave Woods a 1-stroke advantage.
</P>
<P>
	   Back and forth they went, trading shot for shot. Els drew even by knocking
down the flag at No. 11 for a birdie, but gave it back when Woods birdied the
par-5 15th. Els hurt his own chances by missing birdie putts of 6 and 4 feet on
the back nine.
</P>
<P>
	   "If you're not making putts, you can hit the ball as good as you want," he
said. "Against a guy like Tiger, you need to make those putts."
</P>
<P>
	   Woods finally blinked by missing the 17th green and making bogey, leaving
them all tied with one hole to go. And then the level of play soared to new
heights.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you're in competition that close, you don't realize what you're
doing," Woods said. "You're just trying to hit this shot, right here, right
now."
</P>
<P>
	   That's what they both did.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods hit a 3-wood to 8 feet and appeared to sew up the victory. Not so
fast, said the Big Easy. He laced a 2-iron to 6 feet, then rolled his eagle putt
on top of Woods.
</P>
<P>
	   Returning to 18, Els again gave himself an eagle try, this time from 30
feet. Woods left his approach out to the right, and his 60-foot putt rolled 6
feet under the hole. After Els' chance to win slipped by on the right, Woods
extended the playoff.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just made more putts at the right time," Woods said.
</P>
<P>
	   Woods now has won eight out of his last 11 PGA tournaments, an astounding
show of dominance. It also was the 14th straight time worldwide that Woods has
had at least a share of the lead after 54 holes and gone on to win.
</P>
<P>
	   Along with $522,000 -- enough to move him to No. 3 on career money list
after fewer than four full seasons on the PGA Tour -- Woods won a Mercedes SL500
Sport that sells for $88,000, and a blazer made of cashmere and silk valued at
$3,300.
</P>
<P>
	   He also sent a scary message to the rest of the PGA Tour: It might take a
superhuman effort to beat him.

<HEADLINE> Healthy Bird Flies High for UConn  </HEADLINE>
    By CHUCK SCHOFFNER AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Basketball is fun again for Connecticut's Sue Bird.
</P>
<P>
	   Sidelined after eight games last season by a torn ligament in her left knee,
Bird was miserable. There were times Connecticut needed her steady hand at point
guard. Instead, she could do nothing but sit and watch.
</P>
<P>
	   All that has changed this season. Bird is healthy and she was at her best in
top-ranked Connecticut's biggest game to date, a 74-67 victory over No. 2
Tennessee on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   She handled Tennessee's pressure with aplomb, ran the offense and made one
big basket after another while scoring a career-high 25 points as Connecticut
(12-0) broke a three-game losing streak to the Lady Vols.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is as fun a basketball as you're ever going to get to play," Bird
said. "Most times, teams thrive on pressure and that's what our team did. We
came up with some big plays."
</P>
<P>
	   In a game matching teams that run and play hard-nosed defense, guard play
was going to be critical. And Bird clearly outplayed her Tennessee counterpart,
Kristen Clement.
</P>
<P>
	   Clement went scoreless and committed seven turnovers. Bird was 8-of-10,
including two critical 3-pointers in the second half, and came up with four
steals and two assists.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think you could tell she really took over the game for us," Connecticut's
Shea Ralph said. "We needed somebody to step up and play well and Sue did it
almost single-handedly."
</P>
<P>
	   Bird is the type of player who's tough without showing it. With her constant
smile and bubbly personality, she seems like such an easy-going sort. She grew
up in Syosset, N.Y., on Long Island, and UConn coach Geno Auriemma joked that
the last thing anyone stole there was a newspaper off somebody's porch.
</P>
<P>
	   But Bird was toughened for the college game at Christ the King High School
in Queens, where former Tennessee star Chamique Holdsclaw played.
</P>
<P>
	   Though Ralph and preseason All-American Svetlana Abrosimova also had a big
hand in Saturday's victory, Bird was the MVP.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's a part of her ... when the game gets to be very, very difficult,
she has the same thing Svet and Shea has," Auriemma said. "It's just packaged
differently and it comes out differently.
</P>
<P>
	   "She doesn't let everybody see it until it's time to see it. I think people
are shocked when they do see it because it doesn't look like she has it. But she
has it."
</P>
<P>
	   Because of her injury, Bird didn't get a chance to show much of anything as
a freshman last year. When Tennessee traveled to Storrs, she watched as her
top-ranked team faded down the stretch and lost to the second-ranked Lady Vols
92-81.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was dying to be out there," Bird said. "It's really hard to sit there and
know you can't do anything about what's going on out on the court. Because of
that experience, I think I value each game much more. I try to come out and play
every play like it's the last. Because it could be."
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee (11-2) struggled all day against Connecticut's sticky defense. The
Lady Vols shot 34 percent and could not capitalize on Connecticut's foul
problems, missing 14 of 33 free throws.
</P>
<P>
	   "I thought it was apparent from the beginning that Connecticut was confident
and aggressive," Tennessee coach Pat Summitt said. "We were on our heels and not
getting back in transition. They were more aggressive and mentally tougher."
</P>
<P>
	   Michelle Snow led Tennessee with 21 points and 12 rebounds, and Semeka
Randall scored 20 points.
</P>
<P>
	   The two teams meet again in Storrs on Feb. 2. It would not be a surprise if
they met a third time -- in the Final Four.
</P>
<P>
	   "We can't dwell on this," Randall said. "We've got to bounce back and play
good basketball. The championship was not today. We still have time to get
better."

	   Phoenix at N.Y. Islanders (7:30 p.m. EST). The Pacific Division-leading
Coyotes visit the Islanders, the NHL's worst team.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Doug Gilmour, Blackhawks, had a goal and an assist as Chicago defeated
Colorado 5-3.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Arturs Irbe, Hurricanes, made 30 saves as Carolina blanked the New York
Rangers 1-0.
</P>
<P>
	   Arturs Irbe, pulled in the second period of Friday night's 4-4 tie with
Anaheim after giving up three goals, was sharp on Sunday night. Irbe, despite a
small battle with the flu, stopped 30 shots for his third shutout of the season
and 22nd of his career as Carolina blanked the New York Rangers 1-0.
</P>
<P>
	   Colorado's Peter Forsberg scored two goals, but the Avalanche couldn't come
back Sunday night, losing 5-3 to the Blackhawks. Forsberg, who scored his goals
two minutes apart in the second period, also extended his point streak to eight
straight games.
</P>
<P>
	   Northwest Division-leading Colorado had its five-game (4-0-1) unbeaten
streak snapped by a 5-3 loss to Chicago on Sunday night. The Blackhawks, who
have the league's third-worst home record, posted consecutive home victories for
the first time this season.
</P>
<P>
	   Wendel Clark signed a contract with Toronto on Sunday, contingent on him
being in shape to play. It will be the left wing's third stint with the Maple
Leafs and comes after his release by the Blackhawks last month. The 14-year
veteran had two goals in 13 games with Chicago this season. Last season, Clark
played with Tampa Bay (28 goals, 42 points in 65 games) and Detroit (four goals,
six points in 12 games and two goals, three assists in 10 playoff games).
</P>
<P>
	   Peter White had a goal and two assists as the Philadelphia Phantoms tied a
club record with five power-play goals in a 7-4 victory over the Springfield
Falcons in AHL action Sunday. Seven players scored to help Philadelphia extend
its season-high winning streak to seven games. Both teams combined for 256
penalty minutes in a fight-marred contest, with the Phantoms accumulating 130
for a new team mark.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was pretty much dead meat from 6 o'clock last night until midnight, and
today I felt like I was laboring hard. Usually, I am just gliding in the net and
barely break a sweat in a game." -- Carolina goalie Arturs Irbe, who played with
a fever and chills, on his 30-save, shutout performance in the Hurricanes' 1-0
victory over the New York Rangers on Sunday night.

<P>
	   RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- After a dismal December, the Carolina Hurricanes are
starting to turn things in their favor.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is a good time to be playing well," Carolina coach Paul Maurice said
following Sunday night's 1-0 victory over the New York Rangers, improving the
Hurricanes' record to 4-2-1 in their last seven contests. "All these games are
so important."
</P>
<P>
	   A tight playoff chase has developed between about six Eastern Conference
teams for a couple of postseason spots. The Hurricanes have 42 points and trail
sixth-place Pittsburgh by two heading into a seven-game stretch against
conference foes.
</P>
<P>
	   After losing seven of nine in one December stretch, Carolina rebounded in
with wins over Boston and New York.
</P>
<P>
	   "It shows what we have here, that we don't collapse under pressure and
really pull off the best efforts when it's necessary," said Arturs Irbe, who
stopped 30 shots for his 22nd career shutout.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is great news," Irbe said of Carolina's recent surge. "We should be
able to pull if off in the end when it counts. But hopefully we can win some
games when it's not a must-win situation."
</P>
<P>
	   In the only other NHL game, Chicago beat Colorado 5-3.
</P>
<P>
	   Irbe, 3-1 against New York last season with a stellar 1.56 goals against
average, stymied the Rangers again despite playing with the flu.
</P>
<P>
	   The 32-year-old goalie, pulled from Friday night's tie with Anaheim after
giving up three goals, was sharp this time in notching his third shutout of the
season.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was important to the rest of the team to see him bounce back," Maurice
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Andrei Kovalenko's second-period goal was the game-winner. He has 10 goals
in 22 games against the Rangers, one of the teams trailing Carolina in the
playoff chase.
</P>
<P>
	   New York, coming off a pair of wins over Toronto, couldn't string together
its third three-game winning streak.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not frustrated at all," Rangers coach John Muckler said. "We played
well enough to win the hockey game, we just had the misfortune of losing it
because we couldn't score goals. That's where the improvement has to be."
</P>
<P>
	   The Hurricanes, urged by coach Paul Maurice to shoot more, complied for a
third straight game. Carolina, which moved back to the .500 mark, fired 28 shots
at New York goalie Mike Richter, who was spectacular at times.
</P>
<P>
	   "You hate to spoil a performance like that and not get a goal for him,"
Muckler said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kovalenko's goal came on a great individual effort 6:34 into the second. The
left winger circled into the slot with a New York defenseman trailing and lifted
a back-handed shot over Richter's glove.
</P>
<P>
	   "His strength is such that if he gets beside you, he's got you beat,"
Maurice said. "He has been a heck of a player for us this year."
</P>
<P>
	   Gary Roberts picked up one of the assists on Kovalenko's eighth goal to
extend his point streak to eight games.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rangers, who scored at least one power-play goal in five straight road
games, were shut out Sunday by the NHL's best home penalty-killing unit.
</P>
<P>
	   Doug Gilmour had a goal and an assist as Chicago snapped Colorado's
five-game unbeaten streak.
</P>
<P>
	   Dean McAmmond, Eric Daze, Tony Amonte, Alex Zhamnov also scored for Chicago,
which has consecutive home victories for the first time this season. Steve
Sullivan assisted on two goals for the Blackhawks, who have the league's
second-worst home record at 6-12-3.
</P>
<P>
	   Colorado's Peter Forsberg scored goals two minutes apart in the second
period, extending his point streak to eight games.
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Drury had the other Colorado goal.

<HEADLINE> Cincinnati Back on Top of Top 25  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM O'CONNELL AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Cincinnati, which has won six straight since its only loss of the season,
moved back into the No. 1 spot in the AP college basketball poll today,
replacing Stanford after a run of three weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bearcats (14-1) were No. 1 for five weeks until losing to Xavier. That's
when Stanford (12-1) moved in, and the Cardinal held it until losing to Arizona
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's just a ranking. It's not special," Cincinnati forward Pete Mickeal
said Saturday night when it was obvious the Bearcats would move back on top.
</P>
<P>
	   Coach Bob Huggins was noncommittal about his team's standing in the poll.
</P>
<P>
	   "You can take Stanford, Connecticut, possibly Arizona right now and probably
us and shake 'em up," Huggins said. "I don't know that there's a whole lot of
difference."
</P>
<P>
	   Cincinnati received 62 first-place votes and 1,740 points from the national
media panel, while Arizona (13-2) jumped three places to second after the win
over Stanford and received five No. 1 votes and 1,640 points.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cardinal dropped two spots to third. Auburn, which was No. 1 on two
ballots, held fourth place.
</P>
<P>
	   Connecticut, the preseason No. 1 which won 10 straight after the season
opener, fell from second to fifth after losing to Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
	   Duke, which opened the Atlantic Coast Conference with road wins over
Virginia and Maryland, moved up two places to sixth. Syracuse (11-0), the only
remaining unbeaten Division I team, stayed seventh, getting one first-place
vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Kansas and Indiana moved one spot each to eighth and ninth, while Florida,
which lost at Vanderbilt last week, dropped from sixth to 10th.
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan State led the Second Ten for the second week in a row and was
followed by Tennessee, North Carolina, Oklahoma State, Texas, Oklahoma, Ohio
State, Maryland, Tulsa and Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
	   The last five ranked teams were DePaul, Illinois, Temple, LSU and
Louisville.
</P>
<P>
	   Temple returns to the Top 25 after a one-week absence, and Louisville moves
in for the first time since last season.
</P>
<P>
	   The Owls (8-3) finally got point guard Pepe Sanchez back after he missed
eight games with a sprained ankle, and they opened their Atlantic 10 season with
easy wins over Rhode Island and St. Joseph's.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cardinals (10-3) moved in on a five-game winning streak that started
following a 30-point loss to Kentucky. Louisville has beaten two ranked teams --
North Carolina and Utah -- in its last four games. The Cardinals were ranked for
one week last January.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah (11-3) dropped out from 18th following the 75-55 loss to Louisville.
It's the second time this season the Utes have fallen out of the rankings.
</P>
<P>
	   UCLA (9-3) dropped out from 24th following a weekend split to open
conference play, losing to Washington and beating Washington State.
</P>
<P>
	   Kentucky, which beat Georgia Tech and Vanderbilt, had the week's biggest
jump, from 25th to No. 20, while Maryland, which lost to North Carolina State
and Duke, had the biggest fall, dropping from 12th to No. 18.

	   COLLEGE PARK, Md. (AP) -- Duke has once again established itself as the team
to beat in the Atlantic Coast Conference.
</P>
<P>
	   Maryland, on the other hand, now faces the task of climbing out of a very
unfamiliar position: the ACC cellar.
</P>
<P>
	   Chris Carrawell scored 20 points and freshman Carlos Boozer had 17 points
and 15 rebounds as the sixth-ranked Blue Devils cruised past No. 18 Maryland
80-70 Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   Duke (11-2, 2-0) never trailed after a 14-point run made it 14-4. The
victory came just four days after the Blue Devils won in overtime at Virginia.
</P>
<P>
	   "Any time you can start your ACC schedule 2-0, home or away, that's huge,"
said Carrawell, the only senior on the Duke roster. "But two games on the road
against two tough teams, I've never done that before in my career. Now we get to
go home."
</P>
<P>
	   The Terrapins (11-4, 0-2) hoped to rebound from Thursday's road loss against
North Carolina State, but Duke took control early and ended a 14-game home
winning streak that began immediately after last season's game against the Blue
Devils.
</P>
<P>
	   "They've had success everywhere over the years," Maryland coach Gary
Williams said. "They're a good basketball team. That's why they win here."
</P>
<P>
	   The Blue Devils have won six straight over Maryland, including the last
three at Cole Field House by a total of 60 points. Duke has reeled off 11
straight wins after starting 0-2 and have a 24-game winning streak in the ACC,
including 13 in a row on the road.
</P>
<P>
	   "We feel very good about beating a very good basketball team on their home
court and to start out the league with two road wins," Blue Devils coach Mike
Krzyzewski said. "It's sensational for our team."
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if his team has established some momentum, Krzyzewski replied, "Our
club is too young to even understand momentum. We're still on one-syllable
words.
</P>
<P>
	   "I just know that you keep getting better by being in tough situations,
especially if you end up being successful," he said. "We've had a very tough
schedule. If we didn't play early on the road the first few weeks of the season,
I don't think we would have won these two games."
</P>
<P>
	   In the other only game involving a ranked team on Sunday, No. 17 Ohio State
beat Minnesota 71-63.
</P>
<P>
	   The Terrapins missed 20 of their first 25 shots from the field, but were
only down 39-34 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   A jumper in the lane by Juan Dixon pulled Maryland to 51-47 with 11:06 to
play, but Carrawell hit a 3-pointer to start a 13-1 run. He again connected from
beyond the arc to make it 61-48 with 7:58 left, effectively ending any hope the
Terrapins had of mounting a comeback.
</P>
<P>
	   Terence Morris had 18 points and 13 rebounds for the Terrapins, while Lonny
Baxter added 14 points and 16 rebounds. But Morris was 6-for-15 from the field
and Baxter was 7-for-23, a big reason why Maryland finished at 34 percent for
the game.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was one of those days," said Baxter, who missed 13 of his first 16
shots. "We had great shots; they just didn't fall."
</P>
<P>
	   And now Maryland has tumbled all the way into last place in the conference.
</P>
<P>
	   "Why we didn't shoot the ball well, I don't know," Williams said. "We've got
some time to work on some things. We will get better offensively."
</P>
<P>
	   In each of the past two games, the Terrapins found themselves working to dig
themselves out of an early hole. Maryland fell behind N.C. State 18-4 and
trailed Duke 14-4 with less than six minutes elapsed.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had easy shots; we just didn't finish," said Dixon, who was 6-for-18
from the field. "We make those shots early and we're in it at the end. The last
two games, we're always playing catch up. We can't keep doing that."
</P>
<P>
	   The backcourt of Michael Redd and Scoonie Penn accounted for 45 points, and
the Buckeyes (9-3, 1-1) came up big at the free-throw line, making 10 of 12 in
the final five minutes. Ohio State was the Big Ten's worst free-throw shooting
team last season. Penn, who finished with 20 points, made four free throws in
the final 21 seconds.
</P>
<P>
	   Joel Przybilla had 15 points, 14 rebounds and seven blocks for the visiting
Golden Gophers (9-3, 1-1).

<HEADLINE> Military Facing Recruiting Troubles  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the economy booming, jobs plentiful and expectations
high, the American military faces a critical watershed as the new millennium
opens, a private study group reported today.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For many of today's youth, enlisting in the military is an alien
thought,'' the Center for Strategic and International Studies said in a two-year
study of military culture. ``With the number of veterans dwindling, local
advocates and role models are fading in number.''
</P>
<P>
	   All branches of the all-volunteer armed services face tremendous pressures
in recruiting and retaining qualified men and women for today's computerized
high-tech warfare, the study said.
</P>
<P>
	   The nation no longer has an identifiable major military adversary. But at no
comparable period in peacetime history has the United States leaned more heavily
or frequently on its armed forces for such missions as peacekeeping and drug
intervention.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In an era when `peacetime' America has never been safer from military
aggression, ... this volunteer force has never been busier,'' the
Washington-based center said. 'Today, the smallest force in four decades -- with
56 percent married -- is overworked, underpaid and underresourced at the cutting
edge.''
</P>
<P>
	   Lt. Cmdr. Terry Sutherland, a Pentagon spokesman, could not comment on the
study because he said he has not seen it. ``We look forward to reading it,''
Sutherland said.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said there is little doubt that conditions within the armed
forces are far less favorable than they were even 10 years ago, and the U.S.
military faces ``potentially serious rifts in its culture.''
</P>
<P>
	   Today's soldiers are older and more often married than in the days when the
ranks were filled with young draftees. Consequently, the study found, modern
warriors have higher expectations on matters that affect the quality of their
lives and the satisfaction they experience in their jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   Military policy-makers face difficult choices on how best to spend their
budgets on new weapons, maintaining bases and facilities, training personnel,
repairing aging equipment, increasing pay and finding money for unforeseen
contingencies.
</P>
<P>
	   The study, based on responses by thousands of military men and women, offers
numerous recommendations that the authors maintain could help Pentagon leaders
better cope with the needs of their troops.
</P>
<P>
	   The public must be better educated about how military culture and the
demands it makes on soldiers and their families differ from civilian life, the
report said. And, it said, the stress level must be reduced by either increasing
the military's resources or reducing or redesigning its missions.

<HEADLINE> David Crosby Is Etheridge Kids' Dad  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Rock star Melissa Etheridge has revealed the paternity of
the two children she shares with her lesbian partner, and it turns out he's a
two-time rock hall of famer.
</P>
<P>
	   In a cover story for Rolling Stone magazine, Etheridge says David Crosby,
the singer and songwriter from Crosby, Stills and Nash, fathered her toddler
children with filmmaker Julie Cypher via artificial insemination.
</P>
<P>
	   Etheridge, 38, had long refused to disclose the paternity of 3-year-old
Bailey and 1-year-old Beckett, prompting speculation on the biological father's
identity. Gossips speculated on celebrities such as Brad Pitt and Tom Hanks.
</P>
<P>
	   But the couple revealed the secret in grand fashion -- posing on the cover
of Rolling stone with the two children, Crosby, and his wife, Jan. The article
was released to the media on Sunday; the magazine hits newsstands on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   "We just got so tired of this secret," Etheridge told the magazine. "It
wears you out. And keeping this big secret goes against how we are choosing to
live our lives -- very openly."
</P>
<P>
	   Cypher, 35, carried the children. Crosby, who is 58 and the father of three
other children, doesn't plan to help raise Bailey and Beckett -- which is fine
by Etheridge and Cypher.
</P>
<P>
	   "If, you know, in due time, at a distance, they're proud of who their
genetic dad is, that's great," said Crosby.
</P>
<P>
	   He had his first hit ("Mr. Tambourine Man") in 1965 as a member of the
Byrds, and is in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland as a member of the
Byrds and as one-third of Crosby, Stills and Nash.
</P>
<P>
	   The Grammy-winning Etheridge said Crosby's wife first suggested the idea
when the two couples chatted during a vacation in Hawaii a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   "It came from her, which was the best, most perfect way," Etheridge said.
"For one, he's musical, which means a lot to me, you know, and I admire his
work. And he has his own life, has his own family."
</P>
<P>
	   Cypher and Etheridge live in Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> GM To Buy Remaining Half of Saab  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. plans to buy the remaining 50 percent
of Swedish luxury automaker Saab Automobile AB.
</P>
<P>
	   Terms of the deal announced today were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
	   GM has owned 50 percent of Saab since 1990, when it entered into an
agreement with Saab's former parent, Saab-Scania AB. That company was acquired
by Investor AB in 1991, and Investor AB had controlled the other half.
</P>
<P>
	   GM, the world's biggest auomaker, expects to complete the purchase by the
end of January.
</P>
<P>
	   Saab and GM have been sharing engineering and vehicle parts over the past
several years, and Saab is part of GM's exhibit at the North American
International Auto Show.
</P>
<P>
	   "Over our 10 years with Saab we've seen increasing market success and
expansion of the Saab brand internationally," GM president and chief operating
officer G. Richard Wagoner said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   "This logical next step of exercising our option to take full ownership will
be to move ahead even faster in developing new innovative Saab products,
contributing even more to a globally diverse portfolio of resources, expertise
and products."
</P>
<P>
	   Saab made about 129,000 cars in 1999, and sells two models, the 9-3 and the
9-5, in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Ford Plans Line of Electric Vehicles  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. said it would begin producing a line of
electric vehicles and bikes under a new brand name -- Th!nk -- that will become
the company's home for vehicles powered by alternatives to internal combustion
engines.
</P>
<P>
	   Th!nk -- the name of a Norwegian electric car that Ford bought a year ago --
will sell its models over the Internet and deliver them to customers, in
addition to sales through Ford dealers.
</P>
<P>
	   Its lineup includes a small plastic-bodied hatchback that can travel 55
miles fully charged, a golf cart-like open vehicle for use in closed communities
and two models of electric bicycles. The hatchback is only sold in Norway now; a
redesigned version will go on sale in the United States within the next two
years.
</P>
<P>
	   The Th!nk Neighbor cart will go on sale by the end of the year, and the
Th!nk bikes will be available this summer.
</P>
<P>
	   "Th!nk is the organization that will provide us with ingenious mobility
solutions for the new millennium," Ford president and CEO Jac Nasser said in a
statement. "It is further proof of the company's commitment to connecting with
the customer."
</P>
<P>
	   Ford already sells an electric version of the Ranger pickup to governments,
utilities and other fleet buyers.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford also said it was committing to selling a sedan with a hybrid
gas-electric powerplant by 2003. The unnamed vehicle would use an internal
combustion engine mated to an electric motor, and will be based on Ford's work
with a federal government program aimed at producing a car that gets 80 miles
per gallon.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford said the hybrid power would add about $3,000 to the car's sticker
price, and suggested that the government create a tax credit for such
vehicles.

<HEADLINE> LA Times Promotes Two Editors  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Los Angeles Times has promoted newsroom veteran Leo
Wolinsky to executive editor and created a new position to oversee the
relationship between the editorial and business departments.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolinsky, one of four managing editors, was promoted to the new position.
Ardith Hilliard, editor of the paper's San Fernando Valley edition, was named
associate editor with responsibility for implementing new ethical guidelines.
Both will report to Editor Michael Parks.
</P>
<P>
	   The new guidelines were adopted by the paper in response to a
much-criticized revenue-sharing deal with the city's Staples Center arena.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Staples Center incident and the subsequent analysis helped clarify the
need for these positions," Parks wrote Friday in a staff memo.
</P>
<P>
	   Many journalists criticized the deal involving the Oct. 10 edition of Los
Angeles Times Magazine as a violation of the journalistic principle that
reporters and editors must avoid financial dealing with the people and
institutions they write about.
</P>
<P>
	   The paper said reporters and editors who worked on the magazine didn't know
of the revenue deal.
</P>
<P>
	   The paper printed a front-page apology to readers Dec. 19 for failing to
disclose the arrangement; the next day, it ran an unprecedented 14-page section
examining the deal.
</P>
<P>
	   That report criticized Parks, Publisher Kathryn M. Downing and the policies
of Mark Willes, a former General Mills executive who was Downing's predecessor
as publisher and now is chairman and CEO of the newspaper's parent Times Mirror
Co. Willes has ordered closer cooperation between the paper's advertising and
news staffs.
</P>
<P>
	   With the apology, the Times published a newly formulated statement of
journalistic principles that included remaining "free of associations or
activities that might compromise our integrity or damage our credibility."
</P>
<P>
	   In announcing the promotions at a newsroom meeting, Parks began by saying he
would not resign. Staffers cheered when he announced the promotion of Wolinsky,
who led the effort to draw up the paper's new principles and guidelines.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolinsky will oversee metro, business, photos and Los Angeles
Times-Washington Post News Service staffs. Times managing editors for regional
editions, projects and features will report to Wolinsky, who joined the Times in
1977 as a staff writer.
</P>
<P>
	   Hilliard, who joined the Times in 1989, became editor of the San Fernando
Valley edition in 1997. No replacement was named for her.

    SINGAPORE (AP) -- StarHub, a Singapore telecommunications company, said
Monday it has concluded an agreement with China Telecom that allows direct voice
and data links between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Singapore's outgoing phone call traffic to China is growing at an estimated
20 percent a year, StarHub said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   "This robust rate is expected to continue in coming years, given the healthy
economic investment and bilateral trade between the two countries," StarHub
said.
</P>
<P>

call traffic. China Telecom is the largest telecommunications operator in China.
</P>
<P>
	   More than three-quarters of Singapore's 3.2 million people are ethnic
Chinese, and the Chinese language is widely spoken in the prosperous island
republic.
</P>
<P>
	   StarHub's commercial operations will begin April 1.

    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened sharply higher today as the market's
enthusiasm soared on the news of the $166 billion combination of America Online
and Time Warner. Technology stocks led the gains.
</P>
<P>
	   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial

	   AOL was up 5 3/4 to 79 1/2 and Time Warner was up 34 1/4 to 99 after their
early morning announcement of their deal, the largest ever between a
traditional, old-line media company and an Internet company.
</P>

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will ask Congress for $50 million for a
joint program with state and local governments to combat water pollution in the
Great Lakes.
</P>
<P>
	   The initiative would make Great Lakes communities such as Detroit,
Milwaukee, Cleveland, Gary, Ind., Duluth, Minn., and Buffalo, N.Y., eligible for
matching grants to help restore waterways for drinking, fishing, swimming,
boating and urban development.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's program would provide $50 million in matching grants to state and
local governments to clean up contaminated sediments, control storm water,
restore wetlands, acquire greenways and buffers and control polluted runoff.
State or local governments would be required to provide at least 40 percent of
the costs.
</P>
<P>
	   The initiative will be targeted at 42 areas of concern, defined in 1987 by a
U.S.-Canadian commission, where the aquatic environment has been most severely
affected. All the areas have significant pollution problems that restrict
fishing, swimming, boating and use for drinking water.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Court Allows AIDS Insurance Limits  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE ASSEO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court, rejecting allegations of illegal bias,
today let an insurance company provide less health care coverage for
AIDS-related illnesses than for other conditions under the same policy.
</P>
<P>
	   The court, without comment, turned down an appeal in which two HIV-positive
men argued that the limit on AIDS coverage violates a federal ban on
discrimination against the disabled.
</P>
<P>
	   The two Chicago-area men, whose names were not given in court papers, bought
health care policies from Mutual of Omaha.
</P>
<P>
	   One policy, purchased in 1992, set a $25,000 lifetime coverage limit for
AIDS-related illnesses but a $1 million maximum for other conditions. The other
policy, purchased in 1997, had a $100,000 limit for AIDS-related illnesses and a
$1 million limit for other aliments.
</P>
<P>
	   The men sued, saying the limits on AIDS coverage violated the federal
Americans With Disabilities Act. The law protects the disabled against
discrimination in many areas, including jobs and public accommodations.
</P>
<P>
	   The Supreme Court ruled in 1998 that people who carry the HIV virus that
causes AIDS are covered by the disabilities law even if they have no visible
symptoms of acquired immunity deficiency syndrome.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal judge in Chicago ruled for the two men in 1998, but the 7th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   Mutual of Omaha did not refuse to sell insurance to people infected with the
human immunodeficiency virus, the appeals court said, but instead made a
coverage decision similar to a furniture store deciding not to sell wheelchairs.
</P>
<P>
	   The appeals court said most health insurance policies contain coverage caps.
Ruling for the two men would ban coverage caps for diseases classified as
disabilities but allow limits on coverage for other illnesses, such as heart
disease, it added.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for the two men told the justices that the limit on AIDS coverage
``presents a classic case of disability-based discrimination.'' The policy would
limit coverage for diseases, such as pneumonia, when they are AIDS-related but
would not limit coverage for the same disease when it is not AIDS-related, the
appeal said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mutual of Omaha's lawyers urged the justices to reject the appeal. They said
the insurance firm had not discriminated because it offered them the same
coverage given to other customers. Mutual's policies limit coverage for other
conditions such as alcoholism, drug addiction and mental illness, the company's
lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
	   The case is Doe vs. Mutual of Omaha Insurance Co., 99-772.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to revive a Pennsylvania
law requiring that some sex offenders be designated ``sexually violent
predators'' subject to lifetime registration and public notice of their address.
</P>
<P>
	   The court, without comment, rejected appeals in which prosecutors argued
that the state can assume people convicted of certain crimes are violent
predators unless they prove otherwise.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck down the law, calling the presumption
``constitutionally repugnant.''
</P>
<P>
	   All 50 states have some type of sexual offender law modeled after the New
Jersey ``Megan's law,'' named for a girl who was raped and killed by a released
convict in her neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the 1995 Pennsylvania law, criminals designated as sexual predators
face a maximum penalty of life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   If released from prison, they must keep their address registered with police
for life. Notice of their presence is given to neighbors, the crime victim,
school and college officials and day-care center directors.
</P>
<P>
	   The law assumes that anyone convicted of certain crimes -- including rape,
kidnapping a child and forcing a child into prostitution -- is a sexual
predator. Such defendants can avoid the designation only by proving in court by
``clear and convincing evidence'' that it is not deserved.
</P>
<P>
	   The law was challenged by Donald Francis Williams, convicted in 1997 of
indecent assault for acts committed against a 9-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
	   A judge ruled the law unconstitutional and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court
agreed last June. The state court said defendants are entitled to all the
due-process protections of other criminal proceedings, in which a defendant is
presumed innocent.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Supreme Court ruling left intact a less-severe classification of
``sexual offender'' that requires people convicted of certain sex crimes to
register their address with police for 10 years after release from prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The appeals acted on today were filed by prosecutors in Williams' case and
those of three other defendants: Douglas Loomis, Jose Luis Collazo and Neil
Edward Larson.
</P>
<P>
	   The law was ``founded on concern over protecting the community from
convicted sexual offenders,'' Erie County prosecutors said in Williams' case.
The law was a sentencing provision and did not lessen the burden of proof for
the underlying crime, the appeal said.
</P>
<P>
	   Williams' lawyers said the law provides ``no protection at all'' while
subjecting defendants to a potential life prison sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   The cases are Pennsylvania vs. Williams, 99-709; Pennsylvania vs. Loomis,
99-730; Pennsylvania vs. Collazo, 99-752, and Pennsylvania vs. Larson, 99-771.

<HEADLINE> Health Funds Lose Round Vs. Tobacco  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE ASSEO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused to let union health funds
in Pennsylvania, Oregon and New York sue the tobacco industry, thwarting their
efforts to recover the cost of smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
	   The court, without comment, turned away the health funds' arguments that
they should be allowed to sue cigarette makers under federal racketeering and
antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuits were patterned after similar claims by state governments. Those
led to settlements in which the tobacco industry will pay the states $246
billion for health-care costs.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department also sued the tobacco industry in September. Today's
court action will not affect that case.
</P>
<P>
	   Seven union health funds in Pennsylvania and six each in Oregon and New York
sued. They accused the tobacco industry of defrauding them into paying to treat
health-plan participants' smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
	   In the cases acted on today, cigarette makers and related industry
organizations were accused of withholding accurate information about smoking's
health effects that might have led the health funds to aggressively discourage
their members from smoking.
</P>
<P>
	   But three federal appeals courts ruled this year that the health funds could
not sue because they essentially were seeking payment for harms suffered by
their members, who could file lawsuits on their own.
</P>
<P>
	   In throwing out the Pennsylvania funds' lawsuit, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals said the states could sue either because state laws granted them that
right, or because of the ``political power of governmental bodies'' that the
union health plans do not have.
</P>
<P>
	   The health plans' lawyers said the lower court rulings mean the entire
health-care industry is barred from suing the tobacco industry under antitrust
law and the racketeering law, which allows triple damages. Individual plan
members cannot sue under those laws, the appeals noted.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a clear national interest in holding tobacco companies
accountable for the public health devastation they have wreaked,'' said lawyers
for the Pennsylvania union health plans.
</P>
<P>
	   The tobacco companies' lawyers urged the court to reject the appeals. They
said individual smokers can sue under other laws besides the antitrust and
racketeering statutes.
</P>
<P>
	   The cases are Steamfitters Local Union No. 420 Welfare Fund vs. Philip
Morris, 99-545; Oregon Laborers-Employers Health &AMP; Welfare Fund vs. Philip
Morris, 99-642, and Laborers Local 17 Health and Benefit Fund vs. Philip Morris,
99-791.

<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court today refused for the second
time in two years to free Microsoft from possibly having to pay
thousands of former temporary employees who were not allowed to
join the company's lucrative stock-purchase program. The justices,
without comment, let stand a federal appeals court ruling that,
according to Microsoft's unsuccessful appeal, ``has far-reaching
implications for the field of employment law.'' Eight people who
once worked for the computer software company sued in 1992, saying
they and thousands more ``permatemps'' illegally had been illegally
shut out of an employee stock purchase plan that allows employees
to buy Microsoft stock at a discount.

	   New Cases of Mad Cow Disease Found
</P>
<P>
	   PARIS (AP) -- French officials have discovered two new cases of
mad cow disease, the Agriculture Ministry said today. The cases,
detected late last year, bring to 31 the number of cows discovered
with the disease in France in 1999. One of the diseased cows was in
the northwest region of Brittany, while the other was found in the
central region of Creuse. Their herds, a total of 341 cows, were
slaughtered late last week. New cases of the disease are expected
to appear until 2001, five years after stringent prevention
measures were taken to prevent outbreaks, the Agriculture Ministry
has said. The disease has an average incubation period of five
years.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pushed by rising costs for prescription drugs
and insurance premiums, growth in the nation's health care bill
accelerated in 1998. Private health care spending increased by 6.9
percent, compared with a 4.8 percent rise in 1997. Growth in
government spending -- on programs such as Medicare, for the elderly
and disabled -- slowed to 4.1 percent, according to an annual report
from the Health Care Financing Administration. Total health care
spending rose 5.6 percent in 1998, compared with 4.7 percent in
1997. The increase was the biggest since an 8.7 percent jump in
1993.

also announced late Sunday in a 20-minute televised address to the
nation that his 15-member Cabinet had tendered its resignation. He
said he would name replacements in the coming days. A deal was

<HEADLINE> Court Rejects 'Got Milk?' Challenge  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Those ads showing famous people with milk mustaches
asking ``Got Milk?'' survived a Supreme Court challenge today.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices, without comment, rejected an appeal in which some dairy
farmers challenged the government's authority to force them to finance the
generic ads aimed at boosting the entire industry.
</P>
<P>
	   Two years ago the nation's highest court upheld a government program
requiring growers and shippers of California peaches, plums and nectarines to
help pay for a no-brand advertising campaign for those fruits.
</P>
<P>
	   That 5-4 ruling said being forced to pay for generic ads does not amount to
unconstitutional ``forced speech.'' Many experts said at the time the decision's
rationale would extend to other generic-ad campaigns as well, such as those for
dairy products, pork and eggs.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal appeals court last March relied heavily on the 1997 ruling when it
threw out the dairy farmers' challenge to the program that, since 1984, has
required them to subsidize generic ads. Dairy farmers and other milk producers
are assessed about $250 million a year for the popular ads.
</P>
<P>
	   The challenge to that mandatory assessment had come in a 1996 lawsuit that
alleged violations of speech and associational rights.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Silence is as much speech as speech itself,'' lawyers for the dairy
farmers said.
</P>
<P>
	   The dairy farmers say they are being forced to spend about 1 percent of
their gross, an amount that can exceed their net income. They called the
assessment ``a tax rate that would rankle almost anyone.''
</P>
<P>
	   The appeal acted on today sought to draw a distinction between the
government program for the fruit industry and the dairy-industry program. It
said the marketing order at issue in the 1997 case comprehensively regulated the
affected commodities, but that the dairy industry marketing order issued by the
Department of Agriculture ``deals only with promotion, research and nutrition
education programs.''
</P>
<P>
	   Justice Department lawyers urged the court to reject the appeal, calling the
distinction it raised ``factually and legally untenable.''
</P>
<P>
	   The case is Nature's Dairy vs. Glickman, 99-439.

<HEADLINE> White House Pushing China for WTO  </HEADLINE>
    By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House plans a campaign-style push to convince
Congress that China belongs in the trade-regulating World Trade Organization, a
Clinton administration official said today.
</P>
<P>
	   The press in Congress is likely to be the last big trade fight of President
Clinton's two terms in office. Like trade deals before it, the China-WTO fight
will make strange bedfellows; Republicans tend to support the deal while the
pro-union Democrats who are Clinton's traditional allies oppose it.
</P>
<P>
	   The White House will concentrate on rounding up Republican votes to admit
China to the WTO this year, White House officials said. Clinton will meet with
his full Cabinet on Jan. 19 to gin up ideas to reach out to the GOP.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton was to announce today that a team headed by Commerce Secretary
William Daley and White House deputy chief of staff Steve Ricchetti will lead
the effort. Ricchetti is a veteran lobbyist. Daley led the White House war room
in 1993 in the administration's successful drive to win approval of the North
American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   The leading opponent of trade deals with China are organized labor,
environmental groups and human rights organizations. On the other side are
business leaders who view China, the world's most populous country, as a vast
untapped market.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents argue that China should be held to the same environmental and
labor standards as American companies and workers. China and other poor
countries see that as an attempt by rich nations to strip them of the
competitive advantages they enjoy with lower wage levels.

    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were sharply higher today as investors reacted
enthusiastically to the $166 billion planned merger of America Online and Time

</P>
<P>
	   In the first hour of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 50.88 at 11,573.44, extending a Friday rally that left the
blue-chip index at an all-time closing high of 11,522.56.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader market indicators were also higher. The Nasdaq composite index was

</P>
<P>
	   Time Warner soared 24 5/16 to 89 1/16 and AOL slipped 1 3/8 to 72 1/16 after

<HEADLINE> SBC Seeks Long-Distance OK  </HEADLINE>
    By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- SBC Communications asked federal regulators today for
approval to become the second Baby Bell to offer long-distance service to its
local customers.
</P>
<P>
	   Hot on the heels of a decision by the Federal Communications Commission to
let Bell Atlantic provide long-distance in New York, SBC filed an application
with the FCC seeking to do the same in Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   SBC officials said the company had more than met the prerequisite for being
allowed to offer long-distance to local customers. Under a 1996
telecommunications law, a Bell company must first open its local phone business
to competition before it can offer long-distance in its calling region.
</P>
<P>
	   "Competition is quite vigorous in the state of Texas as a result of the
processes that have been put into place," said Jim Shelley, president of SBC
regulatory affairs.
</P>
<P>
	   As evidence of that, rivals to SBC have signed up 1.4 million customers in
the state, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I feel confident that after almost 2 years, we are in a position to make a
very strong showing to the FCC," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   SBC wants to position itself to complete the bundle of services -- local
phone, Internet and satellite television -- it already offers Texas customers.
Long-distance calling would enable the company to round out its package. While
not tipping their business plans, company officials pledged that their future
long-distance customers would not be charged a minimum monthly fee.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think you can expect our company to be a very aggressive and innovative
competitor in this market," Shelley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Before it can do that, the company must win approval from the FCC. The
commission has 90 days to decide on the application. It must give substantial
weight to an evaluation by the Justice Department. The Texas Public Utility
Commission also will have an opportunity to weigh in.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas regulators already gave their unanimous approval in December to SBC's
plan, with the commission's chairman declaring that the company had opened its
local markets to competitors. That important endorsement will help boost SBC's
proposal at the FCC.
</P>
<P>
	   SBC filed its application with state regulators in March of 1998. Officials
said the company has undergone extensive reviews and tests since then. A
third-party operator was also brought in to ensure that SBC was properly
processing orders from rivals seeking to switch customers to their service.
</P>
<P>
	   Company officials said the tests determined that SBC systems were treating
competitors fairly.
</P>
<P>
	   Southwestern Bell operates SBC's Texas business. SBC phone systems cover
most of the Southwest and Midwest. Its other units include Pacific Bell, Nevada
Bell, and SNET in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
	   Bell Atlantic last month became the first Bell company to offer
long-distance to its local customers since the passage of the 1996
Telecommunications Act. That law permitted cable, local and long-distance
companies to get into each others' businesses.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John Hamre, the deputy secretary of defense, is resigning
to become head of a major Washington-based think tank, a senior defense official
said today.
</P>
<P>
	   Rudy de Leon, the undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness,
will be nominated to replace Hamre in the No. 2 Pentagon post, the official
said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Like Hamre, de Leon came to the
Pentagon when Les Aspin became President Clinton's first defense secretary in
1993.
</P>
<P>
	   De Leon was undersecretary of the Air Force from 1994-97. Before becoming
Aspin's special assistant in 1993, de Leon was staff director for the House
Armed Services Committee, which Aspin had chaired.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon planned to announce today that Hamre would leave at the end of
March and become head of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the
official said. Hamre has held the No. 2 job since July 1997. Before that he was
the Pentagon's comptroller for four years and he spent 10 years as a staff
member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen accepted Hamre's resignation last week, and Hamre informed his staff
today.
</P>
<P>
	   Hamre took the lead role in preparing the Defense Department's far-flung
computer networks for the Y2K rollover.
</P>
<P>
	   In his new job at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Hamre
will oversee one of the nation's most prominent public policy research
institutions. Founded in 1962, the center's current president is David Abshire,
a former U.S. ambassador to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker Eyes Case-Assignment Probe  </HEADLINE>
   By PETE YOST Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican congressman today demanded an inquiry into
why a judge assigned the cases of four Democratic fund-raisers and presidential
friend Webster Hubbell to judicial appointees of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Howard Coble revealed that in one case, Clinton confidant Vernon Jordan
asked the sentencing judge to be lenient with the defendant, a prominent
businessman whose punishment consisted of community service work for his crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson ``bypassed the random case-assignment process in four campaign
finance cases potentially embarrassing to the president, the DNC, and Democrats
generally and one case involving President Clinton's close personal friend
Webster Hubbell,'' Coble wrote to the federal court of appeals.
</P>
<P>
	   Coble of North Carolina, who is chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee
on courts, said Chief U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson of Washington
may have breached the code of conduct for federal judges by assigning the cases.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Did Chief Judge Johnson abuse her discretion ... and should she have
allowed the normal random case-assignment process to occur?'' asked Coble.
</P>
<P>
	   The Associated Press disclosed last August that Johnson sent the Hubbell
case and the prosecutions of Clinton friend Charlie Trie and fund-raiser Pauline
Kanchanalak to Clinton appointees.
</P>
<P>
	   Coble revealed that Johnson also sent the fund-raising prosecutions of
Howard Glicken and Mark Jimenez to Clinton-appointed judges. Jimenez, of Miami,
fled the country last year after being accused of making illegal contributions
to Clinton, Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., and other Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson's administrative aide, Joe Alexander, had no immediate comment
today. The judge has said she assigned the Hubbell, Trie and Kanchanalak cases
herself, instead of using computerized random assignment, to assure that the
high-profile cases were handled expeditiously.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The revelation that Chief Judge Johnson bypassed ... the random
case-assignment system ... may, without an adequate public explanation, erode
public confidence in the court's ability to discharge its obligations
impartially,'' Coble wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Jordan and former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, wrote
letters seeking leniency for Glicken, who is a friend of Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson assigned the Trie and Kanchanalak cases to U.S. District Judge Paul
Friedman and sent the Hubbell case to Judge James Robertson. Johnson assigned
the Glicken case to U.S. District Judge Henry Kennedy and the Jimenez case to
Judge Emmet Sullivan. The Jimenez case subsequently was reassigned to Friedman.
</P>
<P>
	   There are eight Democrats, all appointed by Clinton, and four Republicans on
the district court in the District of Columbia.

<HEADLINE> P&AMP;G May Sell 2 Skin Product Lines  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CINCINNATI (AP) -- Procter &AMP; Gamble Co. is exploring selling two lines of
skin-cleansing products in order to concentrate on its Clearasil and Oil of Olay
brands.
</P>
<P>
	   P&AMP;G is soliciting bids for its Biactol product line that is sold in France
and Topexan line sold in Italy, management said Monday. The products are
marketed to teens to fight acne.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said it will keep the brands if it does not receive an
acceptable offer.
</P>
<P>
	   If the brands are sold, the employees now working on those products would be
moved into other P&AMP;G jobs, management said.
</P>
<P>
	   Biactol and Topexan represented less than 1 percent of P&AMP;G's total global
beauty products sales in fiscal 1998-99, which ended June 30. The company's
total worldwide sales for that year totaled $38.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cincinnati-based consumer products company has been selling brands in
recent years that do not fit into P&AMP;G's long-term business plans.
</P>
<P>
	   Management said it wants to focus on brands with potential for increases in
global sales, including Clearasil and Oil of Olay.

	   "Cruel Moon" (Hightone) -- Buddy Miller
</P>
<P>
	   Buddy Miller makes country music the way God and Hank Williams intended it,
and he has reached greatness with his third Hightone release, "Cruel Moon."
</P>
<P>
	   Miller, with help from wife Julie and other country musicians so traditional
they're considered alternative, has crafted an album so full of grit and passion
it blurs the lines between country and soul. In fact, it's not hard to imagine
Solomon Burke or Al Green doing "Sometimes I Cry," Miller's powerful ode to a
lost love. But where a soul singer might take such a song to the emotional edge,
Miller's vocals are restrained, the sound of a man just barely keeping it
together in the face of searing pain.
</P>
<P>
	   Miller and his wife are just about the best thing coming out of Nashville
these days, and "Cruel Moon" is an album not to be missed. The Millers seem to
hit new heights with each release.

<P>
	   "Hey You" (Lucky Dog) -- Jack Ingram
</P>
<P>
	   Jack Ingram is the real deal, a Texas singer-songwriter along the lines of
Robert Earl Keen. And while Ingram has a ways to go before he is in Keen's
league as a songwriter, he's clearly getting there.
</P>
<P>
	   Oh, and he rocks, too, as several of the barn-burners on "Hey You" clearly
show. The song that really stands out here, though, is "Biloxi," in which a man
tries to come to terms with a father who left his family for the good times and
pretty girls of Biloxi.
</P>
<P>
	   When Ingram can write everything at that level, he will have arrived as a
major force. In the meantime, he's good listening for those tired of the
watered-down mush that generally masquerades as country music.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'The War Zone'  </HEADLINE>
    By CHRISTY LEMIRE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   "The War Zone" will make little money at the box office.
</P>
<P>
	   It's about incest -- not exactly a topic that blockbusters are made of. And
the film's long, silent moments and languid pace will frustrate many.
</P>
<P>
	   But this dark, startling film is admirable for its gutsiness in tackling
such taboo terrain and for a strong performance from its young star.
</P>
<P>
	   "The War Zone" is about the drastic changes that occur when a family moves
from London to the quiet of the Devon countryside.
</P>
<P>
	   Gawky, 15-year-old Tom (Freddie Cunliffe) misses his friends in the city,
and spends time during Easter break with his worldlier 17-year-old sister,
Jessie (Lara Belmont). Their mother (Tilda Swinton) is extremely pregnant with
her third child and their father (Ray Winstone) is always on the phone, talking
business.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite their close living quarters, these people rarely speak to each
other. They sit silently in the same room, sipping tea, or spy each other in
dark hallways. A tension boils beneath the surface for the film's first
half-hour, then explodes when Tom learns an ugly secret.
</P>
<P>
	   One night, he returns home and sees his father and Jessie through a window
in what appears to be an inappropriate position. And the more time Tom spends
with Jessie, the more suspicious he becomes.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a sick world," Tom comments to his mother early on, not realizing how
right he is. The rest of the movie follows his quest to expose the truth, and
the denial he encounters from everyone around him.
</P>
<P>
	   Actor Tim Roth ("Reservoir Dogs," "Pulp Fiction") directs, and his work
behind the camera is often haunting. From the breathtaking opening shot of waves
crashing mercilessly against a rocky seashore under a cloudy sky, it's clear
this is a film of strong images.
</P>
<P>
	   But Roth tends to be heavy-handed in conveying his themes of abuse and
loneliness.
</P>
<P>
	   In their tiny house on the coast with no neighbors for miles, the family is
isolated. But even when they go out in public, they are completely alone. Dad,
Jessie and Tom eat at a London restaurant where they're the only patrons. The
family visits a pub for some pints and there isn't even a bartender.
</P>
<P>
	   And does it constantly have to be raining or windy? Must the sky always
appear so dark and dreary that it could open up any minute and swallow the
family whole? Incest obviously is a bleak subject, but Roth need not bang us
over the head with symbolism.
</P>
<P>
	   Belmont's raw performance, however, serves as the movie's heart. At times
she is all sultry attitude and smoldering eyes. At other times, she is confused,
trembling and helplessly alone with her secret. Even more amazing is that this
is the young actress' first role; the filmmakers discovered her as she walked
down a London street.
</P>
<P>
	   Cunliffe, also a newcomer, simply plays varying shades of sullen. We only
see Swinton as a mother caring for her newborn. We don't learn much about
Winstone's character, either, aside from the despicable things he does to his
daughter. More detailed character development would have made us care more about
these people.
</P>
<P>
	   But that's an easy answer. Despite a climactic -- and surprising -- ending,
there are no easy answers for this damaged family.
</P>
<P>
	   "The War Zone," a Lot 47 Films release, is not rated but contains nudity,
language, some violence and a scene of incest. Alexander Stuart adapted the
screenplay from his novel of the same name. Running time: 99 minutes.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa MD Takes Heat for Stance  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) -- A public hospital doctor who criticized South
Africa's former health minister for not giving anti-AIDS drugs to newborns said
Monday he had been reprimanded for bringing his former boss into "disrepute."
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Costa Gazi, director of public health at Cecilia Makiwane Hospital in
Mdantsane, was brought before a disciplinary committee by the Health Ministry.
The panel recommended a reprimand, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The debate over whether to provide the common anti-AIDS drug AZT to pregnant
women to protect their newborns from infection pitted researchers, doctors and
AIDS activists against the government.
</P>
<P>
	   The government in South Africa -- which has a soaring AIDS rate -- said the
drug was potentially dangerous, too expensive and prevented only a minority of
infections.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere in the world, AZT administered to pregnant women is widely
accepted as a major weapon in preventing the transmission of the AIDS virus from
mother to child.
</P>
<P>
	   Gazi spoke up against former Health Minister Nkosazana Zuma in November,
accusing her of being responsible for the deaths of thousands of children from
AIDS. He said the government's refusal to provide AZT to pregnant women meant
children were unnecessarily contracting the fatal disease.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was found guilty of bringing Dr. Zuma in disrepute," Gazi said. "All I
wanted to do was bring her to court for negligence and culpable homicide."
</P>
<P>
	   Health Ministry officials did not immediately return a phone call seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
	   The Health Ministry's disciplinary action toward Gazi highlighted what
critics of the African National Congress called the party's thin-skinned
response to challenges to its policies. Gazi also is a prominent member of the
Pan Africanist Congress, a small opposition party.

<HEADLINE> Farm Program May Add Income Aid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration will seek significant changes
in federal farm programs to provide additional income assistance to producers,
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said today.
</P>
<P>
	   Glickman declined to discuss the proposals, which will be part of the
president's proposed 2001 budget. Last Friday, the administration announced that
the budget would include an extra $1.3 billion for farm conservation programs,
partly to help farmers cope with depressed commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have an obligation to bring some significant proposals to the table and
we will,'' Glickman said at a news conference. He acknowledged the difficulty of
getting broad support among agricultural interests for major changes in farm
policy.
</P>
<P>
	   Glickman says the 1996 Freedom to Farm law, which scaled back on government
crop subsidies, left farmers without sufficient support for periods when crop
prices are low.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress has provided $15 billion in emergency aid over the past two years
to reimburse farmers for weather-related crop failures and to compensate for a
collapse in grain prices that occurred in 1998. Farm income is expected to drop
$7.6 billion this year unless lawmakers approve another bailout.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to help our farmers over the long-term, not just year to year. In
2000, I will work with Congress to seek significant changes to the 1996 farm
bill, strengthening the safety net and increasing conservation initiatives,'' he
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose sharply higher today as investors reacted
enthusiastically to the $166 billion planned merger of America Online and Time
Warner. Technology stocks led the gains.
</P>
<P>
	   In midday trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up
83.38 at 11,605.94, extending a Friday rally that put the blue-chip index at an
all-time closing high of 11,522.56.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader market indicators also rose today. The Nasdaq composite index was up
113.19 at 3,995.81, and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 14.18 at
1,455.65.
</P>
<P>
	   Time Warner soared 30 11/16 to 95 7/16 and AOL rose 3 1/16 to 76 1/2 after
the early morning announcement of their deal, which would be the largest
corporate merger ever.
</P>
<P>
	   AOL's bold move to acquire Time Warner, an old-line traditional media
powerhouse, gave investors added evidence that the Internet will be one of the
most dominant features in the economy of the future, traders said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This deal took great vision and courage," said Alan Ackerman, senior vice
president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. "It shows that the high valuations that many
analysts have been uncomfortable with may be justified."
</P>
<P>
	   The deal helped lift shares of other Internet service providers as investors
looked ahead to further combinations with media companies. Yahoo! rose 24 1/8 to
439 1/8 and Lycos rose 4 1/4 to 76 1/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Media companies also rose following news of the AOL deal. Disney rose 3
11/16 to 34 13/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology companies provided the strongest boost to the Dow today.
Hewlett-Packard was up 6 15/16 at 110 13/16, and IBM rose 4 3/8 to 117 7/8.
</P>
<P>
	   But the industrial companies that led the Dow higher last week while
technology stocks languished in a midweek slump continued to provide good news.
</P>
<P>
	   Alcoa rose 11/16 to 85 5/16 after reporting it earned 89 cents per share in
the fourth quarter. Analysts had anticipated earnings of 76 cents per share.
Alcoa's board also voted to raise the company's dividend and split its stock
2-for-1.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 548.12 million shares, behind Friday's busy
pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 9.98 to 498.29.

    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks that are moving substantially or trading heavily
today on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   AOL is acquiring Time Warner for about $166 billion in stock in what would
be the biggest corporate merger ever. America Online shareholders would own 55

<HEADLINE> No. 2 Pentagon Official Resigns  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John Hamre, the deputy secretary of defense, is resigning
to become head of a major Washington-based think tank, a senior defense official
said today.
</P>
<P>
	   Rudy de Leon, the undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness,
will be nominated to replace Hamre in the No. 2 Pentagon post, the official
said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Like Hamre, de Leon came to the
Pentagon when Les Aspin became President Clinton's first defense secretary in
1993.
</P>
<P>
	   De Leon was undersecretary of the Air Force from 1994-97. Before becoming
Aspin's special assistant in 1993, de Leon was staff director for the House
Armed Services Committee, which Aspin had chaired.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon planned to announce today that Hamre would leave at the end of
March and become head of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, the
official said. Hamre has held the No. 2 job since July 1997. Before that he was
the Pentagon's comptroller for four years and he spent 10 years as a staff
member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Defense Secretary William Cohen accepted Hamre's resignation last week, and
Hamre informed his staff today.
</P>
<P>
	   Hamre took the lead role in preparing the Defense Department's far-flung
computer networks for the Y2K rollover.
</P>
<P>
	   In his new job at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Hamre
will oversee one of the nation's most prominent public policy research
institutions. Founded in 1962, the center's current president is Richard
Fairbanks, ambassador-at-large in the Reagan administration.

<HEADLINE> Army Inquiry Looms in Gay Harassment  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- In the wake of the killing of a gay private at Fort
Campbell, Ky., the Army's inspector general plans to investigate anti-gay
harassment there and at other Army installations, officials said today.
</P>
<P>
	   The inquiry will be conducted by Lt. Gen. Michael Ackerman, the top
investigator at Army headquarters in the Pentagon, according to officials who
discussed the matter today on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ackerman probe was requested by the commander of Fort Campbell, Maj.
Gen. Robert T. Clark, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ackerman will look into the harassment that witnesses said Pfc. Barry
Winchell suffered at Fort Campbell before he was beaten to death by a fellow
soldier last July. Last Saturday, a military court sentenced Winchell's
roommate, Specialist Justin R. Fisher, to 12 1/2 years in prison as part of a
plea bargain. The deal enabled Fisher to avoid more serious charges of being an
accomplice to the murder and helping cover it up.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, Pvt. Calvin Glover was convicted and sentenced to life in
prison for beating Winchell to death with a baseball bat.
</P>
<P>
	   Outrage over the incident has put a renewed spotlight on the effectiveness
of the Defense Department's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy of allowing gays to
serve in uniform so long as they keep their sexual orientation private. Critics
say that in practice the policy doesn't work because suspected gays are
threatened and harassed.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to examining the circumstances leading up to Winchell's death,
Ackerman is to look more broadly at the way the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy
is implemented throughout the Army.

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker Eyes Case-Assignment Probe  </HEADLINE>
   By PETE YOST Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican congressman today demanded an inquiry into
why a judge assigned the cases of four Democratic fund-raisers and presidential
friend Webster Hubbell to judicial appointees of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Howard Coble revealed that in one case, Clinton confidant Vernon Jordan
asked the sentencing judge to be lenient with the defendant, a prominent
businessman whose punishment consisted of community service work for his crimes.
</P>
<P>
	   Chief U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson of Washington ``bypassed
the random case-assignment process in four campaign finance cases potentially
embarrassing to the president, the DNC, and Democrats generally and one case
involving President Clinton's close personal friend Webster Hubbell,'' Coble
wrote to the federal court of appeals.
</P>
<P>
	   Coble of North Carolina, who is chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee
on courts, said Johnson may have breached the code of conduct for federal judges
by assigning the cases.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Did Chief Judge Johnson abuse her discretion ... and should she have
allowed the normal random case-assignment process to occur?'' asked Coble.
</P>
<P>
	   The Associated Press disclosed last August that Johnson sent the Hubbell
case and the prosecutions of Clinton friend Charlie Trie and fund-raiser Pauline
Kanchanalak to Clinton appointees.
</P>
<P>
	   Coble revealed that Johnson also sent the fund-raising prosecutions of
Howard Glicken and Mark Jimenez to Clinton-appointed judges. Jimenez, of Miami,
fled the country last year after being accused of making illegal contributions
to Clinton, Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., and other Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson's administrative aide, Joe Alexander, had no immediate comment
today. The judge has said she assigned the Hubbell, Trie and Kanchanalak cases
herself, instead of using computerized random assignment, to assure that the
high-profile cases were handled expeditiously.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The revelation that Chief Judge Johnson bypassed ... the random
case-assignment system ... may, without an adequate public explanation, erode
public confidence in the court's ability to discharge its obligations
impartially,'' Coble wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Jordan and former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, wrote
letters seeking leniency for Glicken, who is a friend of Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson assigned the Trie and Kanchanalak cases to U.S. District Judge Paul
Friedman and sent the Hubbell case to Judge James Robertson. Johnson assigned
the Glicken case to U.S. District Judge Henry Kennedy and the Jimenez case to
Judge Emmet Sullivan. The Jimenez case subsequently was reassigned to Friedman.
</P>
<P>
	   There are eight Democrats, all appointed by Clinton, and four Republicans on
the district court in the District of Columbia.

<HEADLINE> GM To Buy Remainder of SAAB  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. continued its international shopping
spree Monday, picking up the 50 percent of Swedish luxury automaker Saab
Automobile AB that it does not already own.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal, terms of which were not disclosed, was the latest GM has made with
foreign automakers as it shores up positions in overseas markets. Last year, GM
bought 20 percent of Subaru, agreed to buy engines from Honda Motor Co. and
began negotiations to buy struggling Korean automaker Daewoo.
</P>
<P>
	   GM bought a 50 percent stake and management control of Saab in December 1989
for $600 million and a $100 million investment in Saab's operations. Since then,
Saab has lost money every year except 1994 and 1995, though it's on target to
break even in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   GM's option to buy the remainder of the company would have expired at the
end of the month.
</P>
<P>
	   Saab and GM have been sharing engineering and vehicle parts over the past
several years, and Saab is part of GM's exhibit at the North American
International Auto Show.
</P>
<P>
	   The pressure on GM to expand its presence in the highly profitable luxury
vehicle market has increased since rival Ford Motor Co. bought Sweden's other
automaker, Volvo, earlier this year. No. 2 Ford's luxury lineup now includes
four makes: Lincoln, Volvo, Jaguar and Aston Martin.
</P>
<P>
	   By being fully under GM ownership, Saab will benefit from sharing
manufacturing, distribution, research and development resources with the world's
largest automaker. GM has invested relatively little into Saab over the past
decade because of the half-ownership situation.
</P>
<P>
	   Once it gains full control, GM is expected to expand Saab's modest model
lineup that now consists of only two primary models: the 9-3 coupe and sedan and
the 9-5 sedan and wagon.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal "will probably enable us to do some stuff with the Saab brand,"
said GM president and chief operating officer G. Richard Wagoner. "I don't
anticipate any radical or significant changes in their plans."

<HEADLINE> No. 2 Pentagon Official Resigns  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John Hamre, the deputy secretary of defense, is resigning
to become head of a major Washington-based think tank, Defense Secretary William
Cohen announced today.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said he recommended that President Clinton nominate Rudy de Leon, the
undersecretary of defense for personnel and readiness, to replace Hamre in the
No. 2 Pentagon post.
</P>
<P>
	   ``John Hamre has been my friend and partner in running the department,''
Cohen said in a written statement. ``He approaches all issues with extreme
confidence and an extraordinary sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said Hamre's biggest achievements were increasing the Pentagon's
computer security and improving its business practices.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Hamre and de Leon came to the Pentagon during Les Aspin's tenure as
defense secretary in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen credited de Leon with tackling many of the Pentagon's toughest
problems, including most recently a growing controversy over the way the
services implement the administration's policy on gays in the military.
</P>
<P>
	   De Leon also has been overseeing an Army investigation of allegations that
American troops killed hundreds of South Korean civilians during the opening
weeks of the Korean War in 1950.
</P>
<P>
	   De Leon was undersecretary of the Air Force from 1994-97. Before becoming
Aspin's special assistant in 1993, de Leon was staff director for the House
Armed Services Committee, which Aspin had chaired.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen said Hamre will leave March 31 and become president and chief
executive officer of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Hamre
has held the No. 2 job since July 1997. Before that he was the Pentagon's
comptroller for four years and he spent 10 years as a staff member of the Senate
Armed Services Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen accepted Hamre's resignation last week, and Hamre informed his staff
today.
</P>
<P>
	   Hamre took the lead role in preparing the Defense Department's far-flung
computer networks for the Y2K rollover.
</P>
<P>
	   In his new job at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Hamre
will oversee one of the nation's most prominent public policy research
institutions. Founded in 1962, the center's current president is Richard
Fairbanks, former ambassador-at-large in the Reagan administration.

stock indexes higher Monday, boosted by merger plans between America Online Inc.
and media company Time Warner Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   AOL, the world's largest Internet service provider, is acquiring Time Warner
for more than $160 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors were spurred on by the prospect of similar mergers between leading
media and Internet players.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones Stoxx Index of 606 European companies closed up 5.64 points at
365.39, while the Dow Jones Euro Stoxx Index, which tracks 324 companies in
countries joining the single currency, ended up 6.05 points at 401.40.
</P>
<P>
	   The media sector of the Dow Jones Stoxx Index overshadowed the rest of the
market with a massive 9.4 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
	   Media and technology heavyweights across Europe also climbed higher after
the merger announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index closed up 1.6
percent at 6,607.7. Pearson Group was up 15.3 percent, EMI Group rose 15.3
percent and BSkyB was up 12.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In Paris the CAC 40 index closed up 1.9 percent at 5,646.12 points. Pay-TV
company Canal Plus and Lagardere led media sector gains after news of a deal
between the two companies. Canal Plus closed 17.1 percent higher and Lagardere
closed 10.1 percent higher.
</P>
<P>
	   The Netherlands' benchmark 25-share AEX index closed up 1.6 percent at
655.14 and the Swiss Market Index closed 0.1 percent higher at 7,452.8.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Frankfurt's Xetra DAX index closed up 2.1 percent at 6,925.52.
</P>
<P>
	   Other media and Internet darlings included Spanish Internet specialist Terra
Networks which rose 6.2 percent, Dutch publisher Wolters Kluwer, up 10 percent,
and Germany's SAP which gained 6.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Milan's MIBtel index bucked the trend, however, falling 1.2 percent to
39,716. Although Internet stocks such as Aedes increased, investors opted to
take profits in selected telecoms and financial stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones Euro Stoxx 50 Index finished up 65.8 points at 4,714, while
the DJ Stoxx 50 Index ended up 59.1 points at 4,511.6.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court To Hear Rape Lawsuit  </HEADLINE>
   By PAUL TOLME Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SPRINGFIELD, Va. (AP) -- In a case that could redefine the legal boundary
between federal and state government, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments
Tuesday on whether a former Virginia Tech student can sue two men who allegedly
raped her.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices will decide whether Congress overstepped its authority in 1994
when it passed the Violence Against Women Act, the federal law under which
Christy Brzonkala sued for damages.
</P>
<P>
	   In March, the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals threw out Ms. Brzonkala's
lawsuit, saying Congress' power to regulate interstate commerce and ensure equal
protection did not authorize it to enact such a law.
</P>
<P>
	   Calling the 1994 law a ``sweeping intrusion'' into matters traditionally
handled by the states, the appeals court said violence against women has only an
``indirect relationship with interstate commerce.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Brzonkala's lawyers claim the law is needed because state justice
systems do not adequately protect women from rape, sexual assault and domestic
violence. Such victimization costs the U.S. economy billions of dollars every
year, they say.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're concerned that the justices understand the devastating economic
impact that violence against women has on the economy,'' said Martha Davis,
legal director of the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Battered women are frequently stalked at work, with the goal of having them
lose their jobs, she said. In addition, half of the women on welfare are victims
of violence and half of all rape victims have their ability to work impaired,
she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The law is backed by the Clinton administration and most state attorneys
general. It was co-sponsored by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, a Republican
presidential hopeful and chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
	   Opponents counter that, regardless of the law's sympathetic intent of
helping women, the federal government should not have unlimited power to
regulate state matters such as crime.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The states have been defending Americans' right to be free of violence
before there was a federal government,'' said Curt Levey, spokesman for the
Center for Individual Rights in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress enacted the law because it was politically correct, he said.
``Congress figured, `We have nothing to lose. We will win some votes and nobody
will object,''' Levey said.
</P>
<P>
	   Defending the law under the interstate commerce clause, which says the
federal government can regulate national economic interests, is stretching the
Constitution to the breaking point, he argued.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You could say Congress could regulate sleep because that affects
commerce,'' Levey said.
</P>
<P>
	   In striking down the law, the appeals court relied heavily on a 1995 Supreme
Court decision that struck down as unconstitutional the federal Gun-Free School
Zones Act, which made it a federal crime to possess a gun within 1,000 feet of
any school.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Brzonkala said she was attacked in a dormitory. She did not report the
alleged incident for several months and no criminal charges were filed against
Antonio Morrison and James Crawford, both players on the school's football team.
She contended that Virginia Tech protected them because they were athletes.
</P>
<P>
	   Ms. Brzonkala, who has consented to releasing her name to the public,
declined a request for an interview from The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   The only personal information her lawyers would reveal is that she lives in
Washington, is in her early 20s, never returned to Virginia Tech following her
freshman year and attended another college for a brief time.
</P>
<P>
	   Her lone public appearance was Friday, when she spoke at a news conference
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Rape is like having your soul torn out,'' she said. ``This violence
happens to too many women, and we need laws on the books to fight it.''

<HEADLINE> Farm Program May Add Income Aid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration will seek significant changes
in federal farm programs to provide additional income assistance to producers,
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said today.
</P>
<P>
	   Glickman declined to discuss the proposals, which will be part of the
president's proposed 2001 budget. Last Friday, the administration announced that
the budget would include an extra $1.3 billion for farm conservation programs,
partly to help farmers cope with depressed commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have an obligation to bring some specific proposals to the table and we
will,'' Glickman said at a news conference. He acknowledged the difficulty of
getting broad support among agricultural interests for major changes in farm
policy.
</P>
<P>
	   Glickman says the 1996 Freedom to Farm law, which scaled back on government
crop subsidies, left farmers without sufficient support for periods when crop
prices are low.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress has provided $15 billion in emergency aid over the past two years
to reimburse farmers for weather-related crop failures and to compensate for a
collapse in grain prices that occurred in 1998. Farm income is expected to drop
$7.6 billion this year unless lawmakers approve another bailout.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I want to help our farmers over the long-term, not just year to year. In
2000, I will work with Congress to seek significant changes to the 1996 farm
bill, strengthening the safety net and increasing conservation initiatives,'' he
said.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Up 133.04; Dow Up 27.30  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology stocks rose sharply today as investors reacted
enthusiastically to the $166 billion planned merger of America Online and Time
Warner. Blue-chips gave up some of their early momentum and were modestly
higher.
</P>
<P>
	   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up
27.30 at 11,549.86, struggling to extend a Friday rally that put the blue-chip
index at an all-time closing high of 11,522.56. In earlier trading, the Dow had
risen as much as 115.10 points.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index was up 133.04 at 4,015.66, and the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index was up 11.72 at 1,453.19.
</P>
<P>
	   Time Warner soared 28 to 92 3/4 and AOL slipped  5/8 to 72 13/16 after the
early morning announcement of their deal, which would be the largest corporate
merger ever.
</P>
<P>
	   AOL's bold move to acquire Time Warner, an old-line traditional media
powerhouse, gave investors added evidence that the Internet will be one of the
most dominant features in the economy of the future, traders said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This deal took great vision and courage," said Alan Ackerman, senior vice
president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. "It shows that the high valuations that many
analysts have been uncomfortable with may be justified."
</P>
<P>
	   The deal helped lift shares of other Internet service providers as investors
looked ahead to further combinations with media companies. Yahoo! rose 30 5/8 to
437 7/8 and Lycos rose 4 1/4 to 76 1/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Media companies also rose following news of the AOL deal. Disney rose 3 7/8
to 35, and Times Mirror rose 3 to 66 13/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts suggested the combination of AOL and Time Warner stimulated
interest in cable and wireless companies as well as Internet and media
companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology companies provided the strongest boost to the Dow today.
Hewlett-Packard was up 7 1/2 at 111 3/8, and IBM rose 3 1/16 to 116 9/16.
</P>
<P>
	   But the industrial companies that led the Dow higher last week while
technology stocks languished in a midweek slump continued to provide good news.
</P>
<P>
	   Alcoa rose 11/16 to 85 5/16 after reporting it earned 89 cents per share in
the fourth quarter. Analysts had anticipated earnings of 76 cents per share.
Alcoa's board also voted to raise the company's dividend and split its stock
2-for-1.
</P>
<P>
	   Corporate earnings for the recently ended fourth quarter are widely expected
to show strong growth, setting a stage for further gains by U.S. stocks. Later
this week, high-profile technology companies including Yahoo! and Intel will
release their fourth-quarter figures.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 715.58 million shares, behind Friday's busy
pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 11.80 to 500.11.

<HEADLINE> Cos. Settle With FTC on Coupons  </HEADLINE>
   By REBECCA SINDERBRAND Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three companies agreed Monday to modify coupon and cash
rebate programs that federal regulators called ``false and misleading.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bumble Bee Seafoods Inc., Memtek Products Inc. and UMAX Technologies reached
agreements with the Federal Trade Commission to compensate some consumers and
speed rebates to others.
</P>
<P>
	   The public has until Feb. 9 to comment before the FTC decides whether to
make the agreements final. None of the companies admitted any violations of law
in agreeing to the settlements.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal with Bumble Bee addressed a special label on the face of its tuna
cans that asked consumers to purchase the product with the promise of a 75-cent
coupon for their next purchase. Further details of the program -- those
requiring the consumer to buy five cans of tuna before redeeming the coupon --
appeared on the inside label.
</P>
<P>
	   San Diego-based Bumble Bee has agreed to start a new $200,000 coupon
program, with 7.6 million coupons to be distributed nationally and to include
rebate details where consumers can see them.
</P>
<P>
	   Memtek Products Inc., a Santa Fe Springs, Calif.-based office printing and
audiovisual supplier promised purchasers of its 100-count package of computer
diskettes that they would receive a $29.99 rebate within 12 weeks after the
company received their requests.
</P>
<P>
	   Memtek, which sells Memorex brand products, also offered purchasers of their
blank audio and videotapes a $10 gift check, which were good for purchases of
prerecorded compact discs or videotapes at the electronics retailer Best Buy.
The gift checks were supposed to arrive within eight weeks of the consumer's
request.
</P>
<P>
	   The FTC alleges that consumers received the rebates and gift checks several
months later than promised.
</P>
<P>
	   UMAX Technologies, a manufacturer of digital products, offered rebates up to
$50 on certain models of computer scanners. They were supposed to be paid to
consumers within 12 weeks of a request. But the agency said it often took up to
five months longer for customers to get their rebates.
</P>
<P>
	   Both Memtek and Fremont, Calif.-based UMAX have agreed to deliver rebates by
written deadlines or within 30 days if no time period is stipulated.

<HEADLINE> Health Funds Lose Round Vs. Tobacco  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The tobacco industry won a significant legal victory
Monday when the Supreme Court refused to let union health funds sue cigarette
makers to recover the cost of treating smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices rejected appeals in which union health funds from Pennsylvania,
Oregon and New York argued they should be allowed to sue tobacco companies under
federal racketeering and antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're gratified,'' said Herbert Wachtel, a lawyer for Phillip Morris Inc.
``Four courts of appeals have held unanimously that these third-party cases are
without merit. Hopefully, this will put an end to them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Although Monday's action set no national precedent, the three unsuccessful
appeals had been viewed as health funds' best chance to reverse rulings that
have thwarted their lawsuits against cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
	   John Banzhaf of Action on Smoking and Health lamented the court's action.
``The tobacco industry gets to keep its ill-gotten gain and the public health
loses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Banzhaf said the court's denial of review ``sounds the death knell for these
types of lawsuits by health funds and possibly by other third parties as well.''
</P>
<P>
	   Federal appeals courts also have disallowed smoking-related lawsuits by Blue
Cross, foreign countries and smokers' employers.
</P>
<P>
	   The health funds' lawsuits accused the tobacco industry of defrauding them
into paying to treat illnesses caused by health-plan participants' smoking.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuits contended cigarette makers and related industry organizations
withheld accurate information about smoking's health effects that might have led
the funds to more aggressively discourage their members from smoking.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuits were patterned after similar state claims that led to
settlements in which the tobacco industry will pay the states $246 billion for
health care costs. The Justice Department also sued the industry; its pending
lawsuit was not directly affected by Monday's action.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal appeals courts ruled unanimously that the union health funds could
not sue because they were seeking payment for damages suffered by their members,
who could sue on their own.
</P>
<P>
	   In dismissing the lawsuit by seven Pennsylvania union health funds, the 3rd
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the states could sue because they were
authorized to do so under state law, or because of the ``political power of
governmental bodies'' -- authority and power union health funds do not have.
</P>
<P>
	   In their Supreme Court appeals, the health funds' operators argued their
members cannot sue under the federal laws they tried to invoke -- laws that
provide for tripled damages.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a clear national interest in holding tobacco companies
accountable for the public health devastation they have wreaked,'' one of the
appeals said.
</P>
<P>
	   Banzhaf said tobacco companies are being given future immunity from such
lawsuits. ``Even if the tobacco industry's conduct costs health plans billions
of dollars in the future, they're not going to be able to collect a dime,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   He suggested that all such funds protect themselves by charging higher
premiums for smokers.

<HEADLINE> Asian Nations Top Economy List  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BRISCOE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two societies under authoritarian regimes were cited by
international economists Monday as the most economically free in the world --
Hong Kong and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
	   An index compiled with the help of think tanks in 53 countries ranks
countries on a variety of economic issues. It reaches the same conclusion about
the top of the list as a similar report by the conservative Heritage Foundation
last month. Both also scored New Zealand third and the United States fourth.
</P>
<P>
	   Hong Kong topped economic freedom lists before it was returned to China in
1997 and has not slipped, said the report's principal author, James Gwartney.
Criteria for the ranking include the size of government, structure of the
economy, monetary policies, price stability, freedom to use alternative
currencies, recognition of property rights, freedom of trade, and openness to
international markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Gwartney said that although political and civil freedoms are not part of the
index, high economic freedom tends to increase pressure for democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think the fact we have elections is what counts for the high level
of achievement of the United States," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The annual Economic Freedom of the World report was published by the Cato
Institute and Canada's Fraser Institute and released at news conferences in
Washington and Hong Kong. Sponsors said it was constructed under the leadership
of Milton Friedman, Nobel prize winner.
</P>
<P>
	   "It shows the critical role that economic freedom plays in achieving and
maintaining prosperity," said Ian Vasquez of Cato, which advocates limited
government, free markets, individual liberty and peace.
</P>
<P>
	   Other countries ranking in the top 10 were the United Kingdom, Ireland,
Australia, Canada, Luxembourg, and in a tie for tenth, Netherlands and
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
	   The least free economies among 123 surveyed were Burma, Democratic Republic
of Congo, Sierra Leone, Rwanda, Madagascar and Guinea-Bissau.

<HEADLINE> Intimate Murders Prompt Concern  </HEADLINE>

<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- A mother doused with gasoline and set afire. The pregnant
girlfriend of a pro football player. A woman desperate to get her ex-husband
arrested.
</P>
<P>
	   Police say each was a recent victim of the grimmest oxymoron in the criminal
justice lexicon: intimate murder.
</P>
<P>
	   On average, nearly four American women are killed each day by a husband,
ex-husband or boyfriend. The nation has made impressive strides in confronting
domestic violence, but high-profile cases of the past month have hammered home
the fact that difficult, costly challenges remain.

	   ``When you see these headlines, it's very frustrating,'' said Bonnie
Campbell, director of the Justice Department's Violence Against Women Office.
``We have a ways to go in terms of changing attitudes. I expect that will take
decades, but we're making progress.''
</P>
<P>
	   According to the latest figures from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the
number of women killed in intimate murders dropped from 1,600 in 1976 to 1,326
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, improvements are needed in many areas, activists say: more space in
battered women's shelters, more domestic-violence awareness programs for judges,
more money to hire more staff for casework, more communication among different
agencies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If we want them to do all those additional things, we need to give them
the money to hire the personnel,'' said Michaele Cohen, executive director of
the Maryland Network Against Domestic Violence. ``They have real concerns about
being able to do the job right.''
</P>
<P>
	   Maryland was the scene of one of the most wrenching recent killings,
involving a woman who knew she was in danger and took repeated legal steps to
protect herself. Janice Lancaster's ex-husband killed her with a shotgun last
week, then killed himself, as a judge's order for his arrest on harassment
charges lay unprocessed in a clerk's office.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere:
</P>
<P>
	   -- In Texas, prosecutors charged a businessman last week with arranging the
1997 murder in Florida of his ex-wife. Her quadruplet toddlers from a later
marriage were found crawling around in her blood.
</P>
<P>
	   -- In North Carolina, pro football player Rae Carruth faces charges of
masterminding the fatal drive-by shooting of his pregnant girlfriend. The child
survived.
</P>
<P>
	   -- In California, a mother who obtained a restraining order against her
estranged husband died last week after he set her on fire.
</P>
<P>
	   Murders like those in Maryland and California -- where the victims sought
protection -- are especially dismaying to anti-violence activists.
</P>
<P>
	   Rita Smith, executive director of Denver-based Coalition Against Domestic
Violence, said better early-warning systems are needed, even in the cases where
a woman did not complain to police.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's rare that someone just out of the blue decides to kill his wife,''
Smith said. ``The signs of escalation, and stalking behavior that these guys
give off are not being paid attention to the way they need to.''
</P>
<P>
	   Over the past five years, nearly $1.4 billion has been allocated to state
and local programs under the 1994 federal Violence Against Women Act. Congress
is expected to renew and strengthen the act this year, increasing shelter space
and toughening penalties for interstate stalking.
</P>
<P>
	   The act comes under scrutiny Tuesday as the U.S. Supreme Court hears
arguments on whether a former Virginia Tech student can sue two men who
allegedly raped her. In March, a federal appeals court threw out Christy
Brzonkala's lawsuit, saying Congress overstepped its powers when it allowed rape
victims to sue for financial damages.
</P>
<P>
	   Recent federal and state initiatives have made it easier for women to escape
abusive relationships, so much so that many more shelters are needed to
accommodate the demand. One result has been a dramatic decrease in the number of
men killed by abused women who felt there was no other way out.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the number of men killed by
female partners fell from 1,357 to 516 between 1976 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Overwhelmingly, the men are killed by women in self-defense,'' said Kim
Gandy, a vice president of the National Organization for Women. ``But the women
are in greatest danger after they leave. The men are pursuing, not defending.''
</P>
<P>
	   When embittered men do pursue, a woman's best option might be to seek a
protection order from the courts. But Campbell said this can be a fateful
decision.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The act of leaving, that act of independence, may be a trigger for more
violence and sometimes homicide,'' she said. ``And leaving isn't just that one
day. It's a process that can go on for many months. It's a hard thing for the
justice system to monitor, but we have to find ways to do it.''

<HEADLINE> Court Won't Revive Pa. Predator Law  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE ASSEO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court refused Monday to reinstate the main
part of Pennsylvania's sexual-predator law, thrown out by a state court on the
ground that it violated defendants' rights.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices made no comment in rejecting prosecutors' argument that the
state can assume people convicted of certain crimes are violent predators unless
they prove otherwise.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck down that part of the law, which it
called ``constitutionally repugnant.''
</P>
<P>
	   All 50 states have some type of sexual offender law modeled after the New
Jersey ``Megan's law,'' named for a girl raped and killed by a released convict
who lived in her neighborhood. But the laws vary in many ways.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the 1995 Pennsylvania law, criminals designated sexual predators face
a maximum penalty of life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   If released from prison, they must keep their addresses registered with
police for life. Notice of their presence is given to neighbors, the crime
victim, school and college officials and day-care center directors.
</P>
<P>
	   The law assumes that anyone convicted of certain crimes -- including rape,
kidnapping a child and forcing a child into prostitution -- is a sexual
predator. Such defendants can avoid the designation only by proving in court by
``clear and convincing evidence'' that it is not deserved.
</P>
<P>
	   The law was challenged by Donald Francis Williams, convicted in 1997 of
indecent assault for acts committed against a 9-year-old boy.
</P>
<P>
	   A judge ruled the law unconstitutional, and the Pennsylvania Supreme Court
agreed last June. The state court said defendants are entitled to all
due-process protections of other criminal proceedings, in which defendants are
presumed innocent.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Supreme Court ruling left intact a less-severe classification of
``sexual offender'' that still requires people convicted of certain sex crimes
to register their addresses with police for 10 years after release from prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The appeals acted on Monday were filed by prosecutors in Williams' case and
those of three other defendants: Douglas Loomis, Jose Luis Collazo and Neil
Edward Larson.
</P>
<P>
	   The law was meant to protect communities from convicted sexual offenders,
Erie County prosecutors said in Williams' case. The law was a sentencing
provision and did not lessen the burden of proof for the underlying crime, the
appeal said.
</P>
<P>
	   Williams' lawyers said the law provides ``no protection at all'' while
subjecting defendants to a potential life prison sentence.

	   GM To Buy Remainder of Saab
</P>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. continued its international
shopping spree Monday, picking up the 50 percent of Swedish luxury
automaker Saab Automobile AB that it does not already own. The
deal, terms of which were not disclosed, was the latest GM has made
with foreign automakers as it shores up positions in overseas
markets. Last year, GM bought 20 percent of Subaru, agreed to buy
engines from Honda Motor Co. and began negotiations to buy
struggling Korean automaker Daewoo. GM bought a 50 percent stake
and management control of Saab in December 1989 for $600 million
and a $100 million investment in Saab's operations.

Norwegian electric car that Ford bought a year ago -- will sell its
models over the Internet and deliver them to customers, in addition
to selling through Ford dealers. Its lineup includes a small
plastic-bodied hatchback that can travel 55 miles fully charged, a
golf cart-like open vehicle for use in closed communities and two

temporarily withdrawn after technicians discovered a hacker
attempting to tap into the British-based system, the company said.
A notice was posted on Virgin's Web site this weekend warning users
of the potential breach, and individual letters were mailed to all
those affected, the company said. Only about 25 percent of Virgin's
customer base was potentially involved, company said today. Virgin
Net, which provides e-mail services for 800,000 British customers,
said the accounts potentially affected all belonged to a certain

mad cow disease, the Agriculture Ministry said today. The cases,
detected late last year, bring to 31 the number of cows discovered
with the disease in France in 1999. One of the diseased cows was in
the northwest region of Brittany, while the other was found in the
central region of Creuse. Their herds, a total of 341 cows, were
slaughtered late last week. New cases of the disease are expected
to appear until 2001, five years after stringent prevention
measures were taken to prevent outbreaks, the Agriculture Ministry
has said. The disease has an average incubation period of five
years.

<HEADLINE> Transportation Funds To Be Proposed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton will propose $300 million more for
transportation research, such as projects to extend the life span of bridges,
discourage drunken driving and fight fatigue behind the wheel, Transportation
Secretary Rodney Slater said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The fiscal 2001 budget Clinton will present to Congress next month would
raise the Transportation Department's funds for research and development and
technology from $900 million to $1.2 billion -- a 35 percent increase, Slater
said. He spoke at the annual conference of the Transportation Research Board of
the National Research Council, part of the National Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
	   The increase would provide additional funds for the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration to develop a whole family of crash dummies -- adding a
female and three children to the male dummies used for years, said NHTSA's
acting director Rosalyn Millman.
</P>
<P>
	   The money also would help complete work this year on a driving simulator at
the University of Iowa. ``The simulator uses a real person,'' she said. ``For
example, we're looking at ways to counter fatigue. Some companies have proposed
releasing different kinds of smells to wake drivers up.''
</P>
<P>
	   The extra research money also would be used to try to find ways to put
polymer coatings on bridge spans to make them last 10 or 12 years longer, said
Peter Basso, assistant secretary for budget and programs.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, the research money would be spent on so-called ``intelligent
transportation systems,'' such as using cameras and sensors to monitor traffic
and congestion or developing car phone systems that would automatically summon
emergency vehicles in case of an accident by pinpointing the location with
satellites, Basso said.
</P>
<P>
	   The increased research money will be included in the overall Transportation
Department budget proposal Clinton is to announce on Feb. 7, Basso said. The
department's current budget is about $50 billion.

<HEADLINE> Brit Retailers Fight Wal-Mart Clout  </HEADLINE>
    By BRUCE STANLEY AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- At face value, the announcement Monday that Asda Group PLC
planned to open 14 new supermarkets and add 6,000 employees seemed like a modest
proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   But the British chain is a subsidiary of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world's
largest retailer, and behind Asda's expansion echoed the sound of thundering
footsteps.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts see Asda's growth strategy as evidence of Wal-Mart's effort to
squeeze its competitors in the United Kingdom by expanding its presence,
broadening its product range and paring down prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Wal-Mart has pursued a similar strategy in Germany, where it opened its
doors two years ago. Last week, the Bentonville, Ark.-based company announced a
fresh round of price cuts on hundreds of items in its German stores,
intensifying pressure on its major competitors Metro AG and Karstadt AG.
</P>
<P>
	   British grocery chains have been bracing for a brawl ever since last summer,
when Wal-Mart paid $10.7 billion for Asda in a deal that shook up this country's
insular supermarket industry.
</P>
<P>
	   "Its impact on sentiment has been massive. Everybody is terrified that the
world as we know it is about to change forever," said David Stoddart of the
brokerage Investec Henderson Crosthwaite.
</P>
<P>
	   A lot of companies have demonstrated a new sense of urgency about cutting
prices and operating costs as a result, he said. "Everyone's wondering what Asda
is going to do next."
</P>
<P>
	   Some observers saw nothing new in Asda's latest plan and said the chain has
merely rehashed old ideas in hopes of scoring points against its competitors.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Asda's announcement came at a time of intense scrutiny of the
country's supermarket industry. Consumers are alarmed by talk that prices are
unjustifiably high in "rip-off Britain," and the government's Competition
Commission is investigating the industry for possible evidence of price-fixing.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is Wal-Mart beginning to set out its footprint in the U.K. market,"
said Jim Wood-Smith of London-based brokerage Greig Middleton. "It's going to
make life even more difficult than it currently is for Asda's competition."
</P>
<P>
	   Asda's access to Wal-Mart's deep pockets and expertise in cutting costs
gives it a big advantage, especially against other retailers that lack similar
global economies of scale.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are generally 5 to 10 percent cheaper than our main competition,"
claimed Asda spokeswoman Zaria Pinchbeck.
</P>
<P>
	   And there's more to come: Asda says it will drop prices on 10,000 products
to levels seen in the United States by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   "If Wal-Mart can come in and reduce prices on branded goods, consumers
should certainly benefit," said Delroy Corinaldi of the Consumers' Association,
a national watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
	   However, British customers want more than just low prices; Full-service meat
departments and short checkout lines also are important, analysts and consumer
activists say.
</P>
<P>
	   Headquartered in the northern city of Leeds, Asda has 232 stores and 100,000
employees. While Pinchbeck refused to divulge its latest financial figures,
Asda's annual sales have been estimated at $12.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   As Britain's third-largest grocery chain, with an estimated 16 percent share
of the grocery market, Asda has far to go before it can rival industry leader
Tesco PLC, which has 24 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
	   Tesco slashed prices by a total of $608 million last year. It is also
expanding its Internet business and keeping more stores open for 24 hours a day,
spokesman Russell Craig said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Britain's No. 2 chain J. Sainsbury PLC has come under relentless
pressure since Wal-Mart entered the fray, and there has even been speculation
that the company is a possible takeover candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   Sainsbury's spokesman Greg Dawson put a brave face on its efforts to hold
its own.
</P>
<P>
	   "Wal-Mart's an interesting addition to the U.K. retail market," he said. "We
don't fear them in any way."
</P>
<P>
	   Government rules on land use might yet do what wilting competitors cannot.
</P>
<P>
	   Wal-Mart's expansion plans depend on its ability to develop large sites for
new stores. But such sites are scarce in densely populated Britain, and planning
authorities have taken a dim view of similar developments in the past.

<HEADLINE> N.Y.'s 'Statue of Liberty' license plates on way out  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - License plate scofflaws, beware! Lady Liberty will
only protect you for two more years, state officials said Monday.
<P>
	   New York's 14-year-old red, white and blue "Statue of Liberty" license
plates are being retired and replaced with plates with different colors, a new
numbering and lettering system, and new landmarks - Niagara Falls, the
Adirondacks and a small New York City skyline featuring the Empire State
Building.
</P>
<P>
	   The Department of Motor Vehicles will start distributing the new plates in
October. That means by October 2002, police will be able to easily tell who
haven't renewed their license plates by simply looking for Lady Liberty on
license plates.
</P>
<P>
	   "The DMV staff, with the help of law enforcement agencies, have designed a
beautiful plate which will result in the removal of thousands of illegal
vehicles from the road," DMV Commissioner Richard Jackson said.
</P>
<P>
	   It is estimated that there as many as 700,000 expired or unauthorized
license plates on New York roads, officials said. New York license plates do not
have expiration dates on them.
</P>
<P>
	   The new blue and white tags features Niagara Falls to the left, the
Adirondacks in the middle and a New York City skyline with the Empire State
Building on the right. All of the landmarks are across the top of the plate in
dark blue with a light blue background. "New York" is superimposed in
all-capital white letters.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have designed a new license plate that emphasizes the majestic beauty of
our Empire State," Lt. Gov. Mary Donohue said.
</P>
<P>
	   "THE EMPIRE STATE," which was last seen on a general issue New York license
plate in 1963, returns with the new plates. It is centered on the bottom.
</P>
<P>
	   Only two mottos have been used on general issues plates: "World's Fair" from
1938-40 and 1964-65, "Empire State" from 1957-63 and "The Empire State" from
1951-56.
</P>
<P>
	   The 3/3 licensing pattern also changes with the Empire plate. Instead of
letters or numbers in groups of three divided by the Statue of Liberty, the new
plates will have three letters and four numbers split by a small silhouette of
the state.
</P>
<P>
	   The blue letters on the white background will be larger and easier to see,
which will help law enforcement identify tag numbers.
</P>
<P>
	   "The new Empire plate will provide both police and citizens with an
outstanding tool to more accurately identify plate numbers of a criminal fleeing
the scene of a crime," State Police Superintendent James McMahon said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Statue of Liberty license plates were first issued in 1986 and were the
first New York general issue plates to carry a picture, instead of just letters
and numbers. The Legislature authorized those plates to commemorate the 100th
anniversary of the Statue of Liberty.
</P>
<P>
	   Drivers will have to pay a one-time $5.50 fee for the new plates when they
renew their vehicle registration along with the standard two-year registration
fee.

<HEADLINE> No. 2 Pentagon Official Resigns  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John Hamre, the deputy secretary of defense who oversaw
the Pentagon's largely successful inoculations against the Y2K computer bug, is
resigning to become head of a major think tank.
</P>
<P>
	   In announcing the surprise move Monday, Defense Secretary William Cohen said
he had recommended that President Clinton nominate Rudy de Leon to replace
Hamre. De Leon has been the Pentagon's under secretary for personnel and
readiness for the past two years and previously was under secretary of the Air
Force.
</P>
<P>
	   Hamre, 49, came to the Pentagon in 1993 to be comptroller during Les Aspin's
tenure as defense secretary. He held that post until Cohen made him his top
deputy in July 1997, a position Hamre used to push for modernizing the
Pentagon's business practices and improving the security of its computer
systems.
</P>
<P>
	   ``John Hamre has been my friend and partner in running the department,''
Cohen said in a written statement. ``He approaches all issues with extreme
confidence and an extraordinary sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen credited de Leon with tackling many of the Pentagon's toughest
problems, including most recently a growing controversy over the way the
services implement the administration's policy on gays in the military.
</P>
<P>
	   De Leon also has been overseeing an Army investigation of allegations that
American troops killed hundreds of South Korean civilians during the opening
weeks of the Korean War in 1950. He also has been at the center of efforts --
unsuccessful so far -- to regain Navy use of the Vieques training range in
Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
	   De Leon was undersecretary of the Air Force from 1994-97. He was staff
director for the House Armed Services Committee for four years before Aspin
brought him to the Pentagon to be a special assistant in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   Hamre will leave March 31 and become president and chief executive officer
of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, or CSIS. In joining that
think tank he will be reconnecting with Sam Nunn, the former Democratic senator
from Georgia who was chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee while Hamre
was a committee staff member. Nunn is chairman of CSIS's board of trustees.
</P>
<P>
	   Hamre took the lead role in preparing the Defense Department's far-flung
computer networks for the Y2K rollover. At a cost of $3.6 billion, the effort
was successful except for a temporary breakdown New Year's Eve of a ground
station computer that processes information from a constellation of intelligence
satellites.
</P>
<P>
	   In his new job at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Hamre
will head one of the nation's most prominent public policy research
institutions. It was founded in 1962 by David M. Abshire and the late Adm.
Arleigh Burke.
</P>
<P>
	   The center's current president is Richard Fairbanks, former
ambassador-at-large in the Reagan administration.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 80.66; Nasdaq Up 162.48  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose sharply today as investors reacted
enthusiastically to the $166 billion planned merger of America Online and Time
Warner. Technology shares led the market.
</P>
<P>
	   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 80.66 at 11,603.22, extending a Friday rally that put
the blue-chip index at an all-time closing high of 11,522.56. In earlier
trading, the Dow had risen as much as 115.10 points.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index was up 162.48 at 4,045.10. The
technology-dominated index is up more than 300 points in the past two sessions,
wiping out most remnants of a three-day slump that knocked 400 points off the
Nasdaq last week.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 18.48 at 1,459.95.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology and media companies led a broad advance as investors speculated
that the combination of America Online and Time Warner will spur many more
mergers between new-line and old-line information providers.
</P>
<P>
	   Time Warner soared 28 1/4 to 93 and AOL slipped  1/4 to 73 3/16 after the
announcement of their deal, which would be the largest corporate merger ever.
</P>
<P>
	   AOL's bold move to acquire Time Warner, an old-line traditional media
powerhouse, gave investors added evidence that the Internet will be one of the
most dominant features in the economy of the future, traders said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This deal took great vision and courage," said Alan Ackerman, senior vice
president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. "It shows that the high valuations that many
analysts have been uncomfortable with may be justified."
</P>
<P>
	   The deal helped lift shares of other Internet service providers like Yahoo!,
up 31 1/2 to 446 1/2, and Lycos, which rose 8 1/8 to 80.
</P>
<P>
	   Media companies also rose as analysts forecast a wave of new partnerships.
Disney rose 4 1/4 to 35 3/8, and News Corp. rose 6 1/8 to 43 7/8.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts suggested the combination of AOL and Time Warner stimulated
interest in cable and wireless companies as well as Internet and media
companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology companies also provided the strongest boost to the Dow today.
Hewlett-Packard was up 7 7/16 at 111 5/16, and IBM rose 4 7/16 to 117 15/16.
</P>
<P>
	   The industrial companies that led the Dow higher last week while technology
stocks languished in a slump continued to provide good news, but had a tough
time attracting as much attention as technology and media stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   Alcoa rose just 1/16 to 84 11/16 after reporting it earned 89 cents per
share in the fourth quarter. Analysts had anticipated earnings of 76 cents per
share. Alcoa's board also voted to raise the company's dividend and split its
stock 2-for-1.
</P>
<P>
	   Corporate earnings for the recently ended fourth quarter are widely expected
to show strong growth, setting a stage for further gains by U.S. stocks. Later
this week, high-profile technology companies including Yahoo! and Intel will
release their fourth-quarter figures.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 830.73 million shares, behind Friday's busy
pace.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 12.99 to 501.30.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco industry victory in smoking-relating illnesses case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - The tobacco industry won a significant legal victory
Monday when the Supreme Court refused to let union health funds sue cigarette
makers to recover the cost of treating smoking-related illnesses.
<P>
	   The justices rejected appeals in which union health funds from Pennsylvania,
Oregon and New York argued they should be allowed to sue tobacco companies under
federal racketeering and antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're gratified," said Herbert Wachtel, a lawyer for Phillip Morris Inc.
"Four courts of appeals have held unanimously that these third-party cases are
without merit. Hopefully, this will put an end to them."
</P>
<P>
	   Although Monday's action set no national precedent, the three unsuccessful
appeals had been viewed as health funds' best chance to reverse rulings that
have thwarted their lawsuits against cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
	   John Banzhaf of Action on Smoking and Health lamented the court's action.
"The tobacco industry gets to keep its ill-gotten gain and the public health
loses," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Banzhaf said the court's denial of review "sounds the death knell for these
types of lawsuits by health funds and possibly by other third parties as well."
</P>
<P>
	   Federal appeals courts also have disallowed smoking-related lawsuits by Blue
Cross, foreign countries and smokers' employers.
</P>
<P>
	   The health funds' lawsuits accused the tobacco industry of defrauding them
into paying to treat illnesses caused by health-plan participants' smoking.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuits contended cigarette makers and related industry organizations
withheld accurate information about smoking's health effects that might have led
the funds to more aggressively discourage their members from smoking.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuits were patterned after similar state claims that led to
settlements in which the tobacco industry will pay the states $246 billion for
health care costs. The Justice Department also sued the industry; its pending
lawsuit was not directly affected by Monday's action.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal appeals courts ruled unanimously that the union health funds could
not sue because they were seeking payment for damages suffered by their members,
who could sue on their own.
</P>
<P>
	   In dismissing the lawsuit by seven Pennsylvania union health funds, the 3rd
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the states could sue because they were
authorized to do so under state law, or because of the "political power of
governmental bodies" - authority and power union health funds do not have.
</P>
<P>
	   In their Supreme Court appeals, the health funds' operators argued their
members cannot sue under the federal laws they tried to invoke - laws that
provide for tripled damages.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is a clear national interest in holding tobacco companies accountable
for the public health devastation they have wreaked," one of the appeals said.
</P>
<P>
	   Banzhaf said tobacco companies are being given future immunity from such
lawsuits. "Even if the tobacco industry's conduct costs health plans billions of
dollars in the future, they're not going to be able to collect a dime," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He suggested that all such funds protect themselves by charging higher
premiums for smokers.

<HEADLINE> Ford Plans Th!nk Electric Vehicles  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- Ford Motor Co., the company that put the world on wheels
powered by gasoline, will soon sell a plastic-bodied hatchback, a golf cart and
bicycles -- all powered by electricity.
</P>
<P>
	   The line of electric vehicles, under the brand name Th!nk, will become the
company's home for vehicles powered by something other than internal combustion
engines. It will not only build vehicles, but act as a research center for Ford.
</P>
<P>
	   "The idea of Th!nk is to work on vehicles and technology that's a little
more out there," said Ford president and CEO Jac Nasser on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're using the Th!nk as a way of incubating and hatching new technologies
such as fuel cells. The technology will then migrate to other vehicles."
</P>
<P>
	   Th!nk, the name of a Norwegian electric car that Ford bought a year ago,
will sell its models over the Internet as well as through Ford dealers.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford showed off the Th!nk line Monday during previews for the North American
International Auto Show. The show opens to the public on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Th!nk City is a small plastic-bodied hatchback that can travel 55 miles
fully charged, though it's currently only available in Norway. Ford will
introduce a redesigned version in about two years and could not offer an
estimated cost.
</P>
<P>
	   The Th!nk Neighbor is a golf cart-like open vehicle for use in closed
communities, with speed limited to 25 mph and an estimated price tag of about
$6,000. The two bikes have ranges of up to 30 miles, and will cost between
$1,000 and $1,200.
</P>
<P>
	   While several automakers have built electric vehicles, none has had much
success at selling them, due to their high costs, limited range and long
recharge times. GM sold only 137 of its futuristic EV1 coupes last year, while
Ford sells electric versions of its Ranger pickups, but mostly to governments
and business fleets.
</P>
<P>
	   But Nasser said even though Th!nk might not be a major source of revenue for
Ford, it still made good business sense.
</P>
<P>
	   Th!nk "is clearly meant to push the envelope of new technologies that are a
stretch in terms of technological and business aspects," Nasser said. "But we
really believe that consumers want alternative products. I think all of these
have a place."
</P>
<P>
	   Ford also said Monday it was committing to selling a hybrid gas-electric
sedan by 2003. The unnamed vehicle would use an internal combustion engine mated
to an electric motor, and will be based on Ford's work with a federal government
program aimed at producing a car that gets 80 miles on a gallon of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
	   The company declined to say whether the hybrid's engine would use gasoline
or diesel fuel. Auto industry researchers have focused on diesel engines for
such vehicles, but environmental groups have said diesel engines create too much
pollution.
</P>
<P>
	   Ford said the hybrid power would add about $3,000 to the car's sticker
price, and suggested that the government create a tax credit for such vehicles.

<HEADLINE> Kaye calls for private collection agencies to go after fines  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Private collection agencies will be called in to try
to get people to pay court-imposed fines and surcharges, New York's court
administrators said Monday.
<P>
	   "We're going to go ahead and try it and try to collect every penny we can,"
Chief Judge Judith Kaye said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaye also called in her annual State of the Judiciary address for the
bolstering of drug and community courts so they can handle many more misdemeanor
cases, the establishment of an inspector general to investigate whether the
appointments of fiduciaries and other lawyers are politically motivated and for
the state to continue jury reforms.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaye said officials hope private collectors will be more adept at getting
people to pay up than have court officials.
</P>
<P>
	   "Experience has shown that governmental institutions are not equipped to
function as collection agencies and are therefore not particularly successful at
this task," Kaye said.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Office of Court Administration said private agencies would be used
at first to collect fines and surcharges imposed in six court jurisdictions:
Suffolk County Court, Suffolk District Court, Nassau District Court, Queens
state Supreme Court, New York City Criminal Court and Rochester City Court.
</P>
<P>
	   Jonathan Lippmann, chief state administrative judge, said those courts were
picked because of the large amounts of outstanding payments due. Kaye said that
if the private agencies are successful in those six areas, she wants the
practice to be expanded statewide.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaye proposed using the money the collection agencies raise to help pay for
an increase in the fees paid to court-appointed lawyers who defend indigent New
Yorkers. Those fees are currently $40 an hour for in-court work and $25 an hour
for out-of-court time.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaye called those fee levels "absolutely ludicrous" and "totally
unrealistic" and said too many inexperienced lawyers are handling too many such
cases because they aren't worth the time of veteran lawyers. The entire legal
system suffers because of it, Kaye said.
</P>
<P>
	   She proposed increasing the assigned counsel fees to $75 an hour for felony
and Family Court cases and to $60 an hour for non-felony cases.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaye acknowledged that low-level nonviolent misdemeanor offenders are a
problem to the police, the communities the offenders live in and to the courts.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Gov. George Pataki proposed prosecuting as a felony a fourth
misdemeanor charge against a person with three prior misdemeanor convictions. He
said some criminals had dozens of such convictions on their records for offenses
such as shoplifting, marijuana possession and disorderly conduct without ever
serving prison time.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaye advocated a different approach. She said the prosecution of misdemeanor
offenders often turns into "human recycling" because the court system doesn't
have the capacity to hold actual trials. Of the 375,000 arrest cases in the New
York City Criminal Court last year, for example, only 822 or 0.2 percent, were
resolved at trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaye said the constant plea-bargaining serves neither the defendants nor the
court system.
</P>
<P>
	   She said she will ask the Legislature to create 23 new Criminal Court
judgeships in New York City and also temporarily reassign state Supreme Court
justices to hear misdemeanor cases.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Kaye advocated changing the law so that more bench trials can
be held in misdemeanor cases and that more resources be given to drug and
community courts.
</P>
<P>
	   State Sen. James Lack, a Suffolk County Republican who chairs his chamber's
judiciary committee, said he favors putting more emphasis on drug courts and
other alternative forms of adjudicating cases to provide more room for trying
felony cases in the courts.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers, activists call for feds to monitor Diallo trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Further questioning the change in venue from the
Bronx to Albany, lawmakers and activists called on the U.S. Justice Department
Monday to monitor the upcoming murder trial of four police officers.
<P>
	   The New York State Black, Puerto Rican and Hispanic Legislative Caucus
argued that moving the trial to Albany is an attempt by the defendants to avoid
facing a predominately black and Hispanic jury pool and constitutes special
treatment for the police.
</P>
<P>
	   The four officers are accused of killing West African immigrant Amadou
Diallo in a hail of bullets after mistaking him for a rape suspect.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Diallo incident is another example that something is wrong with the
relationship between communities of color and law enforcement agencies,"
Democrat Assemblyman Keith Wright of Manhattan, chairman of the caucus, said.
"Now more than ever there is a need to take a look at how our police officers
are trained and prepared for the communities in which they perform their
duties."
</P>
<P>
	   Wright expressed particular concern that the percentage of black and
Hispanic jurors be representative of the community. The caucus is also
requesting that New York City and Albany residents be given access and seats in
the court room to monitor the trial.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawmakers also called Monday for the Justice Department to monitor the
trial to make sure there are no violations of civil rights.
</P>
<P>
	   "There will be a lot of anger in the streets of Albany and in New York City
if justice is not served and that's the primary reason that we have requested
that the Justice Department monitor the trial," Wright said.
</P>
<P>
	   A grand jury indicted the plain clothes officers in March after they fired
41 bullets at Diallo, an unarmed street vender, while searching a Bronx
neighborhood for a rape suspect on Feb. 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for the officers - Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and
Richard Murphy - have said their clients mistakenly believed the victim was
reaching for a gun. The four officers were charged with second-degree murder and
all pleaded innocent. Jury selection in their trial is scheduled to begin on
Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting touched off weeks of angry protests leading to more than 1,100
arrests. Activists had planned to demonstrate outside the Bronx courthouse once
the officers went on trial.
</P>
<P>
	   But in an extraordinary decision, a state appeals court moved the trial of
the officers to Albany. In its 11-page ruling, the court said it would be
impossible for the officers to get a fair trial in the Bronx because of media
treatment of the incident.
</P>
<P>
	   "No one is saying that justice won't be served, but we've asked the Justice
Department to monitor the trial just the same," state Sen. David Paterson, a
Manhattan Democrat and another member of the caucus, said. "Because if things do
go awry and there are problems, the Justice Department will be able to put into
process items that might prevent a similar incident occurring again,"
</P>
<P>
	   Anne Pope, president of the Albany branch of the NAACP, compared the Diallo
trial to a recent incident in which 33-year-old Tracy Grady allegedly wrested a
gun from two Albany police officers and shot them before fleeing.
</P>
<P>
	   Following the incident, police swarmed through a black neighborhood dressed
in combat fatigues and helmets, allegedly using excessive force and brutalizing
residents in their search for the gunman.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are concerned to make sure that no one thinks Albany is a safe have for
police who have acted brutally and irresponsibly, whether in New York City or
right here in our own neighborhoods," Pope said.
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo supporters in Albany Monday announced the formation of a Capital
Region Justice for Diallo Committee. Its members said they will "monitor" the
trial, provide support for members of Diallo family when they are in Albany for
the proceedings and to continue pushing for formation of a civilian review board
to oversee the activities of Albany police.

<P>
	   He suggested that all such funds protect themselves by charging higher
premiums for smokers.

<HEADLINE> Kaye calls for private collection agencies to go after fines  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Private collection agencies will be called in to try
to get people to pay court-imposed fines and surcharges, New York's court
administrators said Monday.
<P>
	   "We're going to go ahead and try it and try to collect every penny we can,"
Chief Judge Judith Kaye said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaye also called in her annual State of the Judiciary address for the
bolstering of drug and community courts so they can handle many more misdemeanor
cases, the establishment of an inspector general to investigate whether the
appointments of fiduciaries and other lawyers are politically motivated and for
the state to continue jury reforms.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaye said officials hope private collectors will be more adept at getting
people to pay up than have court officials.
</P>
<P>
	   "Experience has shown that governmental institutions are not equipped to
function as collection agencies and are therefore not particularly successful at
this task," Kaye said.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Office of Court Administration said private agencies would be used
at first to collect fines and surcharges imposed in six court jurisdictions:
Suffolk County Court, Suffolk District Court, Nassau District Court, Queens
state Supreme Court, New York City Criminal Court and Rochester City Court.
</P>
<P>
	   Jonathan Lippmann, chief state administrative judge, said those courts were
picked because of the large amounts of outstanding payments due. Kaye said that
if the private agencies are successful in those six areas, she wants the
practice to be expanded statewide.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaye proposed using the money the collection agencies raise to help pay for
an increase in the fees paid to court-appointed lawyers who defend indigent New
Yorkers. Those fees are currently $40 an hour for in-court work and $25 an hour
for out-of-court time.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaye called those fee levels "absolutely ludicrous" and "totally
unrealistic" and said too many inexperienced lawyers are handling too many such
cases because they aren't worth the time of veteran lawyers. The entire legal
system suffers because of it, Kaye said.
</P>
<P>
	   She proposed increasing the assigned counsel fees to $75 an hour for felony
and Family Court cases and to $60 an hour for non-felony cases.
</P>
<P>
	   The president-elect of the state Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers,
Kathryn Kase, said Kaye was on the right track with her proposed fee increase.
But Kase said the proposal doesn't go far enough.
</P>
<P>
	   "Unless rates are raised to at least $100 per hour, we fear that competent
counsel will continue to flee the assigned counsel panels in urban areas where
overhead costs are higher than $60 per hour," Kase said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaye acknowledged that low-level nonviolent misdemeanor offenders are a
problem to the police, the communities the offenders live in and to the courts.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Gov. George Pataki proposed prosecuting as a felony a fourth
misdemeanor charge against a person with three prior misdemeanor convictions. He
said some criminals had dozens of such convictions on their records for offenses
such as shoplifting, marijuana possession and disorderly conduct without ever
serving prison time.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaye advocated a different approach. She said the prosecution of misdemeanor
offenders often turns into "human recycling" because the court system doesn't
have the capacity to hold actual trials. Of the 375,000 arrest cases in the New
York City Criminal Court last year, for example, only 822 or 0.2 percent, were
resolved at trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaye said the constant plea-bargaining serves neither the defendants nor the
court system.
</P>
<P>
	   She said she will ask the Legislature to create 23 new Criminal Court
judgeships in New York City and also temporarily reassign state Supreme Court
justices to hear misdemeanor cases.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Kaye advocated changing the law so that more bench trials can
be held in misdemeanor cases and that more resources be given to drug and
community courts.
</P>
<P>
	   State Sen. James Lack, a Suffolk County Republican who chairs his chamber's
judiciary committee, said he favors putting more emphasis on drug courts and
other alternative forms of adjudicating cases to provide more room for trying
felony cases in the courts.

<HEADLINE> Corn At 2-Mo. High; Other Grains Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- Corn futures reached a two-month high Monday on the Chicago
Board of Trade amid bullish sentiments that the long price slump may be over.
</P>
<P>
	   Other grains also were mostly higher, while soybeans finished sharply lower.
</P>
<P>
	   Grain prices slipped early in the trading session when soybeans sank,
pressured by weekend rains in South America and forecasts for more showers ahead
in key growing regions.
</P>
<P>
	   But when corn held its own, investors jumped in and bought more contracts to
send it up to its highest level since November. The modest rally sent prices
further away from the $2-a-bushel mark that held like a magnet for weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat also shook off the initial pressure from soybeans, settling up
somewhat on technically driven fund buying. Forecasts for dry weather in much of
the U.S. winter wheat belt helped push the price higher.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat for March delivery rose 1 3/4 cents to $2.53 1/2 a bushel; March corn
rose 1 1/2 cents to $2.08 1/2 a bushel; March oats were unchanged at $1.09 1/2 a
bushel; March soybeans fell 5 1/4 cents to $4.73 1/2 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
	   Beef futures edged lower on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, while pork
futures were mixed.
</P>
<P>
	   February live cattle fell .10 cent to 70.77 cents a pound; March feeder
cattle fell .02 cent to 86.85 cents a pound; February lean hogs rose .03 cent to
55.65 cents a pound; February pork bellies fell 1.32 cents to 80.90 cents a
pound.

<HEADLINE> Mideast Talks End With No Accord  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- Peace talks between Israel and Syria recessed
Monday without agreement on new borders or any other major elements of a
land-for-peace treaty still eluding them despite rigorous American mediation.
</P>
<P>
	   As the two delegations packed to go home, State Department spokesman James
P. Rubin said they would resume negotiations on Jan. 19, probably in the
Washington area. ``We are on the right track,'' he said. He gave no indication
how the gaps might be closed quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   The basic shape of a treaty has been clear since Prime Minister Ehud Barak
took office last July. Israel would surrender virtually all the Golan Heights, a
strategic plateau on the Syrian frontier, for peace, provided security measures
are found to take the place of the highland Israel has held since the 1967
Six-Day War.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria insists on a pullback to the Sea of Galilee, thereby letting it
recover a stretch of land it captured in the 1950s. Another scenario would push
Israel back to borders set in 1923. Or patches of land might be swapped. But
Barak has not specified what line he wants drawn between Israel and an Arab
country with which Israel has fought three major wars.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have not resolved the border issue, but we are working on it, and work
will hopefully continue at the resumption of the talks,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Similarly, other tough issues were not resolved in eight days of talks at
this old West Virginia town, including peace terms, division of scarce water and
security measures.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not going to declare that a major obstacle has been overcome in any of
the particular areas,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We did not reach agreement. ... We did not even get near'' one, Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy said on his return to Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   A source close to the Syrian delegation said the talks had not reached the
objective -- a commitment to withdraw to the Sea of Galilee.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Procrastination and maneuvering will never lead to ... peace because they
will keep the roots of occupation and instability in the region,'' the
government-run Syria Times said in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton, who intervened in the negotiations, some 70 miles from
the capital, for parts of five days and nights, said in Washington that he is
not discouraged.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These people really talked about the substance of their differences for
the first time,'' Clinton said. ``They were very open. They were very candid.
... They broke a lot of ground.''
</P>
<P>
	   But he said ``this is too tough'' to expect a quick breakthrough. ``These
are very difficult issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton is likely to play an active role in the next round as well. But
complicating his schedule is the visit of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
Jan. 20, a day after Israeli and Syrian negotiations reconvene.
</P>
<P>
	   The president has pledged to push for the outline of a final settlement
between Israel and the Palestinians by mid-February. Last week, the two sides
broke a deadlock on a partial Israeli pullback on the West Bank, but they are
only beginning to grapple with far tougher issues, including Palestinian demands
for a state with part of Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said Monday he was ``quite hopeful'' Israel and the Palestinians
would meet the Feb. 13 deadline.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers, activists call for feds to monitor Diallo trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Further questioning the change in venue from the
Bronx to Albany, lawmakers and activists called on the U.S. Justice Department
Monday to monitor the upcoming murder trial of four police officers.
<P>
	   The New York State Black, Puerto Rican and Hispanic Legislative Caucus
argued that moving the trial to Albany is an attempt by the defendants to avoid
facing a predominately black and Hispanic jury pool and constitutes special
treatment for the police.
</P>
<P>
	   The four officers are accused of killing West African immigrant Amadou
Diallo in a hail of bullets after mistaking him for a rape suspect.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Diallo incident is another example that something is wrong with the
relationship between communities of color and law enforcement agencies,"
Democrat Assemblyman Keith Wright of Manhattan, chairman of the caucus, said.
"Now more than ever there is a need to take a look at how our police officers
are trained and prepared for the communities in which they perform their
duties."
</P>
<P>
	   Wright expressed particular concern that the percentage of black and
Hispanic jurors be representative of the community. The caucus is also
requesting that New York City and Albany residents be given access and seats in
the court room to monitor the trial.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawmakers also called Monday for the Justice Department to monitor the
trial to make sure there are no violations of civil rights.
</P>
<P>
	   "There will be a lot of anger in the streets of Albany and in New York City
if justice is not served and that's the primary reason that we have requested
that the Justice Department monitor the trial," Wright said.
</P>
<P>
	   A grand jury indicted the plain clothes officers in March after they fired
41 bullets at Diallo, an unarmed street vender, while searching a Bronx
neighborhood for a rape suspect on Feb. 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for the officers - Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and
Richard Murphy - have said their clients mistakenly believed the victim was
reaching for a gun. The four officers were charged with second-degree murder and
all pleaded innocent. Jury selection in their trial is scheduled to begin on
Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting touched off weeks of angry protests leading to more than 1,100
arrests. Activists had planned to demonstrate outside the Bronx courthouse once
the officers went on trial.
</P>
<P>
	   But in an extraordinary decision, a state appeals court moved the trial of
the officers to Albany. In its 11-page ruling, the court said it would be
impossible for the officers to get a fair trial in the Bronx because of media
treatment of the incident.
</P>
<P>
	   "No one is saying that justice won't be served, but we've asked the Justice
Department to monitor the trial just the same," state Sen. David Paterson, a
Manhattan Democrat and another member of the caucus, said. "Because if things do
go awry and there are problems, the Justice Department will be able to put into
process items that might prevent a similar incident occurring again,"
</P>
<P>
	   Anne Pope, president of the Albany branch of the NAACP, compared the Diallo
trial to a recent incident in which 33-year-old Tracy Grady allegedly wrested a
gun from two Albany police officers and shot them before fleeing.
</P>
<P>
	   Following the incident, police swarmed through a black neighborhood dressed
in combat fatigues and helmets, allegedly using excessive force and brutalizing
residents in their search for the gunman.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are concerned to make sure that no one thinks Albany is a safe haven for
police who have acted brutally and irresponsibly, whether in New York City or
right here in our own neighborhoods," Pope said.
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo supporters in Albany Monday announced the formation of a Capital
Region Justice for Diallo Committee. Its members said they will "monitor" the
trial, provide support for members of Diallo family when they are in Albany for
the proceedings and to continue pushing for formation of a civilian review board
to oversee the activities of Albany police.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Temps May Be Rewarded  </HEADLINE>
   By TED BRIDIS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court refused Monday to free Microsoft Corp.
from having to pay as many as 10,000 temporary employees who were not allowed to
join the company's lucrative stock-purchase program.
</P>
<P>
	   The ruling, the latest against Microsoft on the issue, could have enormous
implications on the nation's high-tech industry, which has classified some
employees as temporary workers to avoid paying certain benefits and to cut
costs.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision opens the way for attorneys representing these former Microsoft
employees to begin calculating how much each might be owed based on stock they
hypothetically could have purchased at a discount.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of that stock has risen nearly 2,400 percent since the original
lawsuit was filed in 1992. An attorney for the former employees, Stephen Strong,
said the case affects more than 6,000 workers -- and possibly as many as 10,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Microsoft said it now has between 5,500 and 7,000 temporary or contingent
workers in the United States, in addition to its roughly 32,000 permanent
employees.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Microsoft was a startup company that wanted to be efficient,'' Strong
said. ``Over time it grew, but it hasn't really matured in treating its normal
employees in ways they should be treated.''
</P>
<P>
	   The justices on Monday, without comment, let stand a federal appeals court
ruling that, according to Microsoft's unsuccessful appeal, ``has far-reaching
implications for the field of employment law.''
</P>
<P>
	   Microsoft spokesman Dan Leach said the company was ``disappointed the high
court has decided now is not the time to review those issues. We look forward to
putting the case behind us, and we value the contributions of everyone who makes
great software for our customers.''
</P>
<P>
	   Eight people who once worked for the Redmond, Wash., computer software
company sued in 1992, saying they and thousands more ``permatemps'' illegally
had been shut out of an employee stock purchase plan that allows employees to
buy Microsoft stock at a 15 percent discount.
</P>
<P>
	   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals twice ruled, most recently in May,
that the temporary employees wrongly had been treated as ``independent
contractors'' or employees of employment agencies.
</P>
<P>
	   They had been entitled under Washington state law to be considered regular
employees, the appeals court said, instructing a federal trial judge to
determine what damages each of thousands of Microsoft's former temporary
employees is owed.
</P>
<P>
	   In the appeal acted on Monday, Microsoft contended the appeals court allowed
too large a ``class'' of former temporary employees to have a stake in the case.
That class could include current temporary employees and any temp who worked at
Microsoft since 1987.
</P>
<P>
	   The appeal also argued that the 9th Circuit court wrongly concluded ``that
an individual employed by an employment agency can simultaneously claim employee
benefits from both the employment agency and the agency's client for which the
individual performs services.''
</P>
<P>
	   Although the case acted on today centered only on Microsoft's stock-purchase
plan, temporary employees also are suing the company for health insurance and
pension benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   The case acted on today is Microsoft Corp. vs. Vizcaino, 99-498.

<HEADLINE> SBC Wants in Texas Long-Distance  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- SBC Communications asked federal regulators Monday to let
it provide long-distance telephone service in Texas, hoping to round out the
package of services it offers to local customers in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   The request comes shortly after a landmark decision by the Federal
Communications Commission to permit Bell Atlantic to offer long-distance to
local customers in New York. SBC filed an application Monday with the FCC
seeking to do the same in Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   SBC wants to position itself to complete the bundle of services -- local
phone, Internet, wireless and even direct satellite broadcast television --
already available to Texas customers. Long-distance calling is a key piece in
giving consumers a one-stop-shopping option.
</P>
<P>
	   Company officials said their bid to enter Texas' long-distance business
would put pressure on other carriers in both the local and long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will be the impetus for lots of competition here,'' said Bob Ferguson,
SBC president for federal relations. The company eventually wants to offer
long-distance throughout its territory. California is likely to be among the
next states it seeks approval for.
</P>
<P>
	   While not tipping their business plans, company officials pledged that their
future long-distance customers would not be charged a minimum monthly fee.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think you can expect our company to be a very aggressive and innovative
competitor in this market,'' said Jim Shelley, president of SBC regulatory
affairs.
</P>
<P>
	   If its application is approved, SBC would become the second Baby Bell to
offer long-distance service to its local customers. Bell Atlantic won the right
to do so in New York last month.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts say the prospects for SBC getting approval are good, especially
since one Bell already has forged a path. They added that the company has worked
hard to show that its local Texas phone business is open to competition -- a
standard that must be met under a 1996 telecommunications law for a Bell company
to offer long-distance in its calling region.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They've got a lot of evidence and a lot of support behind this
application,'' said Mel Marten, telecommunications analyst with Edward Jones in
St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
	   SBC asserts its market is open, noting that about 115 of their rivals have
signed up 1.4 million customers in the state. The company also has undergone a
third-party review to ensure that it is properly processing orders from rivals
seeking to switch customers to their service, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The FCC has 90 days to decide on the application. It must give substantial
weight to an evaluation by the Justice Department. The Texas Public Utility
Commission also will have an opportunity to weigh in.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas regulators already gave their unanimous approval in December to SBC's
plan, with the commission's chairman declaring that the company had opened its
local markets to competitors. That important endorsement will help boost SBC's
proposal at the FCC.
</P>
<P>
	   The company also has agreed to $289 million in penalties if it does not
continue to give its rivals fair access to its systems.
</P>
<P>
	   But some competitors, including MCI WorldCom, which offers local service to
business customers in metropolitan Texas markets, argue that SBC has not passed
the necessary hurdles.
</P>
<P>
	   ``SBC's bid for long-distance authority in Texas is premature. Unlike the
situation in New York, substantial barriers to competition still exist in
Texas,'' the company said in a statement. It called SBC's systems inadequate for
processing orders from competitors.
</P>
<P>
	   Southwestern Bell operates SBC's Texas business. SBC phone systems cover
most of the Southwest and Midwest. Its other units include Pacific Bell, Nevada
Bell, and Southern New England Telecommunications Corp. in Connecticut.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Pop Star Returns for Draft  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- Eager fans weren't the only ones waiting for pop
star Tarkan to land at Istanbul airport Monday after more than a year abroad. So
were the police.
</P>
<P>
	   They scooped the singer off his Air France jet from Paris and handed him
over to military authorities, who wanted him for failing to report for his
obligatory service.
</P>
<P>
	   Tarkan -- whose Arabic-influenced tune ``Simarik,'' or ``Spoiled,'' was at
the top of the French charts last year-- was released from custody after
applying for a new program to reduce his time in uniform.
</P>
<P>
	   Desperate to raise relief money after a devastating August quake, the
government is offering draft-age men -- those between 26 and 40 -- a chance to
reduce their time in the service from 18 months to one month by paying $8,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Tarkan, who uses one name, failed to report to the military last November.
Turkish authorities filed a desertion case that could have cost him his
citizenship.

<HEADLINE> No. 2 Pentagon Official Resigns  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John Hamre, the deputy secretary of defense who oversaw
the Pentagon's largely successful inoculations against the Y2K computer bug, is
resigning to become head of a major think tank.
</P>
<P>
	   In announcing the surprise move Monday, Defense Secretary William Cohen said
he had recommended that President Clinton nominate Rudy de Leon to replace
Hamre. De Leon has been the Pentagon's under secretary for personnel and
readiness for the past two years and previously was under secretary of the Air
Force.
</P>
<P>
	   Hamre, 49, came to the Pentagon in 1993 to be comptroller during the late
Les Aspin's tenure as defense secretary. He held that post until Cohen made him
his top deputy in July 1997, a position Hamre used to push for modernizing the
Pentagon's business practices and improving the security of its computer
systems.
</P>
<P>
	   ``John Hamre has been my friend and partner in running the department,''
Cohen said in a written statement. ``He approaches all issues with extreme
confidence and an extraordinary sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hamre took the lead in preparing the Defense Department's far-flung computer
networks for the Y2K rollover. At a cost of $3.6 billion, the effort was
successful except for a temporary New Year's Eve breakdown of a ground station
computer that processes information from a constellation of intelligence
satellites.
</P>
<P>
	   A native of South Dakota, Hamre will leave the Pentagon on March 31 and
become president and chief executive officer of the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, or CSIS. In a written statement released by CSIS, Hamre
said he considered the post a ``once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
	   In joining the think tank Hamre will reconnect with Sam Nunn, former
Democratic senator from Georgia who was chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee while Hamre was a committee staff member. Nunn, chairman of CSIS's
board of trustees, said Hamre will take over on April 3.
</P>
<P>
	   CSIS ranks among the nation's most prominent public policy research
institutions. It was founded in 1962 by David M. Abshire and the late Adm.
Arleigh Burke. The center's current president is Richard Fairbanks, an
ambassador-at-large in the Reagan administration. Fairbanks called Hamre ``the
ideal individual'' to lead CSIS into the new century.
</P>
<P>
	   Like Hamre, de Leon has worked in the Pentagon since the Clinton
administration began.

<HEADLINE> Co. Reports Progress in DNA Mapping  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Maryland company announced Monday it has sequenced DNA
that accounts for 90 percent of the human genetic pattern, another step as
private laboratories and government scientists race to map all the human genes.
</P>
<P>
	   The new data is "a rough draft," said Celera Genomics president J. Craig
Venter, acknowledging genes in the Rockville, Md., database have not yet been
assembled to know how and where they fit into the genetic blueprint.
</P>
<P>
	   But, "we've discovered literally thousands and thousands of new genes that
are clearly going to be of importance to the pharmaceutical industry, enabling
them to hopefully move therapeutic advancement forward at a much faster pace,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Celera sells its gene information mostly to pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Previously, government-supported scientists had announced sequencing
one-third of the human genome, on track to complete a working draft of the
entire genetic map by spring.
</P>
<P>
	   Venter said Celera did use the government's public gene database to add to
its own gene discoveries and come up with the 90 percent total. Celera's gene
database, however, is not available for government scientists to reciprocate.
</P>
<P>
	   The human genome is a biological map laying out the exact sequence of the
estimated 3.5 billion pairs of chemicals that make up the DNA in each human
cell. Those chemicals are arranged in specific ways to create the estimated
80,000 to 100,000 human genes, which in turn carry the instructions for all the
body's processes.
</P>
<P>
	   Think of it as a huge jigsaw puzzle. Celera uses what it calls a "shotgun
technique" to identify snippets of DNA, quickly accumulating lots of genetic
puzzle pieces that scientists then must go back and fit together.
</P>
<P>
	   In contrast, the government-sponsored Human Genome Project fits the genetic
puzzle pieces together as they are discovered, accumulating larger, more
accurate pieces, said Kathy Hudson of the National Center for Human Genome
Research.
</P>
<P>
	   Celera's stock rose more than 29 percent on the news, to $242 in late
afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Mostly Higher With Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against most major currencies on Monday,
fueled by big gains on Wall Street that boosted demand for the U.S. currency.
</P>
<P>
	   In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0259, down from $1.0276
late Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors cheered the $166 billion planned merger of America Online and Time
Warner, which would be the largest corporate merger ever. The Dow Jones
industrial average soared to a new high, and technology stocks were up sharply.
</P>
<P>
	   Big gains on Wall Street helped to offset some early weakness in the dollar
against the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
	   That was a result of rising concerns that Japan won't be able to get other
Group of Seven nations to help it stem the yen's strength. The G-7 meeting is
scheduled to take place on Jan. 22 in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   When the yen rises, Japanese goods become more expensive and less attractive
in foreign markets, unless manufacturers cut prices and thereby reduce their
profits to keep market share. A strong yen also reduces the value of sales
proceeds in foreign currencies.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar was quoted at 105.20 Japanese yen, down slightly from 105.21.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar also was quoted at 1.5685 Swiss francs, up from 1.5652, and
1.4551 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4560. The British pound fell to $1.6369
from $1.6375.
</P>
<P>
	   Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no longer
traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. Based on Monday's
euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.9065 German marks, up from 1.9033; 6.3940
French francs, up from 6.3834; and 1,887.39 Italian lire, up from 1,884.26.

<HEADLINE> German Union Deal May Not Spur Jobs  </HEADLINE>
    By HANS GREIMEL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- An industry/union compromise on lowering the
retirement age has rescued Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's key initiative to
combat unemployment, but economists said Monday it would do little to promote
the government's goal of creating jobs.
</P>
<P>
	   After weeks of stalled negotiations, Schroeder brokered the compromise
Sunday to lower the retirement age to 60 from 65, a contentious point in the
talks aimed broadly at reviving the sagging German jobs market.
</P>
<P>
	   "Schroeder is the winner because it avoided a total collapse of talks, but
as far as the two other sides are concerned, we don't know yet," said Thomas
Mayer, a senior economist with Goldman Sachs. "One thing is for sure, the early
retirement schemes will not create more jobs."
</P>
<P>
	   Early retirement was proposed as one way to bring down German unemployment,
which hit 10.3 percent in December -- just slightly above the politically
sensitive 4 million person mark. But economists question the fundamentals behind
the plan.
</P>
<P>
	   "Basically, unions don't represent the economy at large or the unemployed,
and in Germany they represent mainly aging members of the work force who are
quickly approaching retirement age," said Mayer, adding that retirement at 60
would give workers a fat pension, while driving up labor costs for their
employers.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, early retirement falls short of creating more jobs because
it simply replaces older employees with younger ones, said Ralph Solveen, an
economist with Commerzbank.
</P>
<P>
	   The next round of talks will continue in late spring and should address
other issues such as pension and tax reform. But after Sunday's meeting, even
unions that had pushed for earlier retirement were lukewarm about the agreement,
which stops short of mandating early retirement, allowing companies to make up
their own rules.
</P>
<P>
	   Germany's most powerful union IG Metall had promised to peg future wage
demands to economic growth if the deal went through. The union had been
targeting a 4 percent raise, above the projected economic growth rate of 2.5
percent to 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   But IG Metall president Klaus Zwickel said he was "not enthusiastic" about
the outcome and was seeking language for "clearly more than 4 percent" wage
increases.
</P>
<P>
	   Dieter Schulte, boss of the powerful Association of German Unions, called
the deal an important first step, but added that it was vague enough to still
leave room for higher wage demands when unions and firms sit down for upcoming
wage talks.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the president of the Association of German Industries maintained that
the agreement obliged unions to scale back their demands, and cited the
Netherlands as a model for creating jobs through reducing wage demands.
</P>
<P>
	   "Over the years there, unions have made contracts that are far under the
economic growth rate, with the result that unemployment is now under 4 percent
there," Hans-Olaf Henkel said.
</P>
<P>
	   Unemployment rates in Germany are forecast to dip slightly over the next
year, but mainly because of a resurgent industrial sector and a demographic
shift of more people leaving the work force.
</P>
<P>
	   Economists say more constructive reforms are needed to anchor real job
growth, including tax breaks for lower income workers and labor market
deregulation.

<HEADLINE> New Nasdaq High; Dow Ends Up 49.64  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology and media shares led the Nasdaq composite to its
biggest point gain ever and the Dow Jones industrials to a new closing high as
investors celebrated the $166 billion planned merger of America Online and Time
Warner.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index rose 166.97 to 4,049.59, according to preliminary
calculations. The technology-dominated index has risen more than 300 points in
the past two sessions, wiping out most remnants of a three-day slump that
knocked 400 points off the Nasdaq last week.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow rose 49.64 to 11,572.20, topping Friday's record close of 11,522.56.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader market indicators were also higher.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks posted eye-popping gains in a wide range of sectors.
Internet service providers, biotechnology companies and businesses that build
computer networks all soared in active trading on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
	   But the biggest story on Wall Street was AOL, whose bold move to acquire
Time Warner spurred a wave of speculation about additional mergers between
new-line and old-line information providers.
</P>
<P>
	   Time Warner soared and AOL slipped modestly after the announcement of their
deal, which would be the largest corporate merger ever.
</P>
<P>
	   AOL's quest for Time Warner, an old-line traditional media powerhouse, gave
investors added evidence that the Internet will be one of the most dominant
features in the economy of the future, traders said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This deal took great vision and courage," said Alan Ackerman, senior vice
president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. "It shows that the high valuations that many
analysts have been uncomfortable with may be justified."
</P>
<P>
	   Enthusiasm for the deal spread quickly to other Internet service providers
like Yahoo! and Lycos. Media companies like Disney and News Corp. also rose as
analysts forecast a wave of new partnerships.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts suggested the combination of AOL and Time Warner stimulated
interest in cable and wireless companies as well.
</P>
<P>
	   "A deal of this size indicates that we will start to see more
consolidation," said Robert Freedman, chief investment officer for the John
Hancock Funds in Boston. "There's a great deal of excitement surrounding these
industries."
</P>
<P>
	   Technology companies also provided the strongest boost to the Dow today.
Hewlett-Packard and IBM made solid advances.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past two sessions on Wall Street, technology stocks have returned to
the form that led the Nasdaq to an unprecedented 86 percent gain in 1999. Many
investors took profits from those gains last week, driving the Nasdaq 10 percent
lower over the course of three sessions.
</P>
<P>
	   Many analysts expected the Nasdaq to fall further. But investors' enthusiasm
for technology stocks, already running high, was kindled again by the AOL deal,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "These stocks had so much momentum that it's very tough to break their
cycle," said Freedman. "Shareholders appear ready and willing to buy on any
dips."
</P>
<P>
	   The industrial companies that led the Dow higher last week while technology
stocks languished continued to provide good news, but had a tough time
attracting as much attention as technology and media stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   Alcoa rose just slightly after reporting it earned 89 cents per share in the
fourth quarter. Analysts had anticipated earnings of 76 cents per share. Alcoa's
board also voted to raise the company's dividend and split its stock 2-for-1.
</P>
<P>
	   Corporate earnings for the recently ended fourth quarter are widely expected
to show strong growth, setting a stage for further gains by U.S. stocks. Later
this week, high-profile technology companies including Yahoo! and Intel will
release their fourth-quarter figures.

<HEADLINE> Bradley, Gore on equal financial footing  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Democratic presidential contenders Bill Bradley and Al
Gore are beginning the year on nearly equal financial footing, each with more
than $16 million on hand.
<P>
	   Much of it could be gone by spring.
</P>
<P>
	   "I see a fight to the end and then a period of silence because they'll spend
so much, they won't have money left," said one campaign finance expert, Herbert
Alexander, professor emeritus of political science at the University of Southern
California.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley had more money in his campaign bank account at the end of the year,
$8.3 million compared with $5.2 million for Gore. But the vice president was
approved for more federal funds than Bradley, $11.1 million versus $8.3 million.
Since then, Bradley has asked for an additional $1.8 million and Gore has
requested an additional $1 million.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's going to be easy for these guys just to keep spending in order to
survive from one primary date to another," Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
	   The government matches the first $250 of each individual contribution to
candidates who agree to limit their spending. In 2000, the limit will be around
$40 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Four years ago, Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole reached the
spending limit months before the party convention, while President Clinton's
campaign was able to keep spending millions of dollars on TV commercials. This
year, the Democrats could be up against the limit until their convention while
Republican front-runner George W. Bush, who is not taking federal funds, keeps
spending.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley campaign officials declined to speculate on what would happen if
they reached the spending limits.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're really concerned with what we can do to go get through Iowa and New
Hampshire and be successful through the rest of the process," campaign spokesman
Tony Wyche said. "We're out to win the Democratic primaries and we have the
resources and the message to do that."
</P>
<P>
	   Gore spokesman Chris Lehane did not immediately return a phone call seeking
comment.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic political consultant Glenn Totten said Gore may not have to match
Bradley dollar-for-dollar to win the nomination. While Bradley has as big a bank
account as Gore, the vice president also has dozens of IOUs that he can redeem
for support during the primaries, Totten said.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is not the money that makes Al Gore formidable, it is the war chest of
political favors he has been doing for the last eight years," Totten said. "It
is an asset that is intangible. That war chest that is going to help Al Gore
through this process."

<HEADLINE> Europeans Share U.S. Flu Misery  </HEADLINE>
   By AUDREY WOODS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- Overburdened British hospitals canceled operations to make
room for flu victims, Israeli doctors treated patients in hallways and
cafeterias on Monday, and the Dutch and Danes shared the flu misery that is
making its way across the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Parts of Europe and the Middle East have been hard hit this year by
influenza, which kills thousands of vulnerable people every year and leaves
millions more ill.
</P>
<P>
	   In Britain, Health Secretary Alan Milburn said Monday the number of flu
cases had quadrupled in the last month and if the outbreak didn't peak soon,
``we could be heading for the worst epidemic in the last decade.''
</P>
<P>
	   And that's not counting the large number of cases that go uncounted because
victims turn to pharmacists or a National Health Service help-line for advice,
rather than going to a doctor, said Liam Donaldson, the government's chief
medical officer.
</P>
<P>
	   Israeli hospitals have increased their staff and many are operating at 175
percent capacity because of the flu outbreak, the Health Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
	   At Laniado Hospital in the coastal Israeli town of Netanya, Dr. Gershon
Lieber said patients were turned away overnight.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are clearing out all sorts of places, cafeterias and offices, so we can
admit as many patients as possible,'' Lieber said, speaking on army radio.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Netherlands, health officials said they expected the flu epidemic to
leave 20 percent of the country coughing and sniffling in the weeks ahead. The
country's eastern provinces have reported nine times the usual number of cases,
according to the National Center for Influenza.
</P>
<P>
	   Spain's Health Ministry said cases were up about 30 percent over last year,
but attributed that to the flu season starting about two weeks earlier than
usual.
</P>
<P>
	   Danish authorities said the country seemed to be in the early stage of an
epidemic, while in the Finnish capital, Helsinki, about 60 percent of people
being treated in health clinics were diagnosed with the flu.
</P>
<P>
	   A flu wave in the German states of Bavaria, Baden-Wuerttemberg and Thuringia
was reported to be slightly higher than normal.
</P>
<P>
	   Rolf Heckler, chief of the National Reference Center for Flu in Hanover,
said doctors were reporting about 30 percent of their patients with respiratory
infections have the flu virus.
</P>
<P>
	   In the United States, flu that struck the western states hard last month has
been making its way along the East Coast. By the weekend, 19 states, including
Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey and Virginia, had reported widespread or
regional flu outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
	   New York State Health Department officials were reporting a dramatic
increase in the number of flu outbreaks statewide -- 80 compared with 19 at the
same time last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Dr. Keiji Fukuda of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in
Atlanta said Monday that this year's flu outbreak didn't appear to be unusually
severe so far.
</P>
<P>
	   The Type A Sydney strain of the flu is the major culprit in the United
States and worldwide, Fukuda said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the flu had been ``picking up'' in the last three weeks and ``it's
pretty clear in some local areas they really have gotten hit pretty hard.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Announces Money To Fight AIDS  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- With AIDS the No. 1 killer in sub-Saharan Africa,
killing 10 times more Africans than war, Vice President Al Gore pledged Monday
to put the continent's AIDS crisis on the world's security agenda and outlined a
new U.S. effort to fight the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
	   Presiding over the first Security Council meeting to address a health issue,
Gore announced that the White House has asked Congress for $150 million for
vaccine research and prevention programs in Africa and said the White House will
convene a meeting of business leaders in Africa to start developing prevention
programs in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We tend to think of a threat to security in terms of war and peace,'' Gore
said in the first speech by a U.S. vice president to the 15-member body. ``Yet
no one can doubt that the havoc wreaked and the toll exacted by HIV/AIDS do
threaten our security.''
</P>
<P>
	   AIDS is now the leading killer in sub-Saharan Africa, a region where poverty
and wars have already taken a heavy toll. In 1998, 200,000 people died as a
result of armed conflicts in Africa, compared to about 2.2 million from AIDS.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke scoffed at reporters' suggestions that
Gore was using his U.N. appearance to further his campaign for the Democratic
nomination for president.
</P>
<P>
	   ``None of what he's doing here today has any direct impact on the present
phase of the primary season, which is intense and being conducted in two states
which are far away from here,'' Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
	   He added that the Clinton administration has approached several members of
Congress about the request for the extra $150 million in the proposed budget and
that ``support has been quite strong.''
</P>
<P>
	   Several African ministers of health addressed the open meeting, thanking
Gore for the pledge of new money and describing in detail how desperately it was
needed.
</P>
<P>
	   Namibia's health minister, Dr. Libertine Amathila, said AIDS was devastating
his country's economy, robbing families of breadwinners and children of their
parents.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is immoral that the worst affected continent has the lowest access to
care,'' she said, urging wealthy countries make drugs to treat those infected
with HIV available at prices Africans can afford.
</P>
<P>
	   She cited statistics from UNAIDS, a Geneva-based organization of
epidemiologists and statisticians who study AIDS, that show only $165 million
was spent on AIDS prevention in Africa in 1996, while estimates suggest that
between $800 million and $2.5 billion a year is needed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is worth pondering how the international community successfully
mobilized hundreds of billions of dollars over the last few years to minimize
the impact of that `other virus' -- Y2K,'' the executive director of UNAIDS, Dr.
Peter Piot, told the council.
</P>
<P>
	   An estimated 23.3 million Africans south of the Sahara currently have HIV or
AIDS, U.N. statistics show.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan said high AIDS death rates among Africa's
elite, including public servants, threatened the ability of some countries to
govern effectively. High infection rates among police and armed forces also have
left African countries ill-equipped to face security threats, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In already unstable societies, this cocktail of disasters is a sure recipe
for more conflict,'' Annan said. ``And conflict in turn provides fertile ground
for further infections.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, Annan invited dozens of representatives from Africa, U.N.
agencies, donor governments, voluntary organizations and businesses to draw up a
plan to reduce infection rates in Africans between the ages of 15 and 24 by 25
percent before 2005.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, he invited the Security Council to join the effort.
</P>
<P>
	   World Bank President James Wolfensohn said such a partnership was the only
way to combat the epidemic effectively.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In a number of countries, we're losing teachers faster than we can replace
them. We're losing judges, lawyers, government officials, persons in the
military,'' he said. ``And unless we act, this will continue and there will
surely be continued instability in the continent.''

<HEADLINE> Cloning May Work for Extinct Goat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MADRID, Spain (AP) -- A rare goat native to a mountainous region of northern
Spain has become extinct, with the last known animal found dead last week under
a fallen tree, authorities said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Fearing the worst, veterinarians working for the Aragon regional government
captured the 13-year-old female mountain goat last spring and took a tissue
sample from its ear, in case they needed to clone it. Then they attached an
electronic tracer to the animal and released it.
</P>
<P>
	   The sample cells have been preserved, but no decision has been made on
whether to try to use the genetic material to try to clone the animal, said
Carlos Ontanon, Aragon's environmental director.
</P>
<P>
	   He added, however, that cloning one goat would not be enough to get the
species started again, since a male goat would be needed for mating.
</P>
<P>
	   The animal belonged to one of several subspecies of Pyrenees mountain goat
and was known in Spanish as a "bucardo." Its scientific name is capra pyrenaica
pyrenaica.
</P>
<P>
	   It is distinguished by a thick coat suitable for frigid mountain weather
and, in the case of females, horns with a broader base than that of other goats.
</P>
<P>
	   Forest rangers in Ordesa National Park in Huesca province found the lone
female last Thursday under a tree. Its skill had been crushed.
</P>
<P>
	   Park director Luis Marquina said the species dwindled steadily over the past
century as a result of poaching and environmental factors, in some cases natural
disasters like landslides.
</P>
<P>
	   The species was declared protected in 1973.
</P>
<P>
	   Last April, Massachusetts researchers announced they had cloned three goats.
The cloned goats were born last fall on a farm in Charlton, the Tufts University
School of Veterinary Medicine and Genzyme Transgenics Corp. of Framingham said.
The first cloned animal was a sheep born in Scotland in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Army Probing Gay Harassment  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Army leaders, stung by the murder of a gay private by a
fellow soldier last summer, are investigating the incident at Fort Campbell,
Ky., defense officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigation also will examine how the Defense Department's policy on
gays in the military is being implemented by commanders in the field throughout
the Army. The policy has come under increasing attack from critics in the
aftermath of the killing at Fort Campbell, and Defense Secretary William Cohen
last month ordered a 90-day review after President Clinton declared it was not
working as intended.
</P>
<P>
	   The Army robe will be headed by it inspector general, Lt. Gen. Michael
Ackerman.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ackerman investigation was requested by the commander of Fort Campbell,
Maj. Gen. Robert T. Clark, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ackerman will look into the harassment that witnesses said Pfc. Barry
Winchell suffered at Fort Campbell before he was beaten to death by a fellow
soldier last July. Last Saturday, a military court sentenced Winchell's
roommate, Specialist Justin R. Fisher, to 12 1/2 years in prison as part of a
plea bargain. The deal enabled Fisher to avoid more serious charges of being an
accomplice to the murder and helping cover it up.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, Pvt. Calvin Glover was convicted and sentenced to life in
prison for beating Winchell to death with a baseball bat.
</P>
<P>
	   Outrage over the incident has put a renewed spotlight on the effectiveness
of the Defense Department's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy of allowing gays to
serve in uniform so long as they keep their sexual orientation private. Critics
say that in practice the policy doesn't work because suspected gays are
threatened and harassed.
</P>
<P>
	   One sergeant who testified at Glover's trial said he had questioned Winchell
about his sexuality, which is a violation of the ``don't ask, don't tell''
policy.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to examining the circumstances leading up to Winchell's death,
Ackerman is to look at what the military calls the ``command climate'' -- the
on-base environment created by its leaders. Ackerman also will look more broadly
at the way the ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy is implemented throughout the
Army.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador To Adopt Dollar As Currency  </HEADLINE>
   By MONTE HAYES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Ecuador will gradually replace its currency with the
U.S. dollar to stabilize the Andean nation's economy and prevent hyperinflation,
government officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Juan Falconi, the production minister, said sucres currently in circulation
would be bought back over the next year and only small denomination sucre coins
would be used.
</P>
<P>
	   Finance Minister Alfredo Arizaga said in a television interview Monday that
Ecuador has $400 million worth of sucres in circulation and holds foreign cash
reserves worth $900 million. That ratio ``means there will be no problem in
swapping sucres for dollars,'' Arizaga said.
</P>
<P>
	   The dark orange 50,000 sucre note, the largest denomination, which bears the
national seal and a portrait of former President Eloy Alfaro, will be replaced
with the American greenback under the plan. Under current exchange rates, 50,000
sucres are worth only $2, forcing shoppers to carry small bricks of cash to make
purchases.
</P>
<P>
	   President Jamil Mahuad announced Sunday night that he was pegging the
exchange rate at 25,000 sucres to the dollar, but details of his plan to make
the U.S. dollar Ecuador's official currency only became clear on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahuad, a Harvard-educated political centrist who took office in August
1998, has faced growing calls to resign after failing to stop the rapid decline
of Ecuador's economy.
</P>
<P>
	   The economy shrank 7 percent and inflation topped 60 percent in 1999, the
highest in Latin America. Many economists predicted that speculation against the
sucre would quickly send Ecuador into hyperinflation this year if the government
did not act.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahuad said Sunday night that replacing the currency was ``the only way out
that we have, and it is the road that we have to travel.'' He predicted that
adopting the dollar would reduce annual inflation to 10 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Ecuador's Central Bank opposed the move, but Mahuad warned that he would
call a special session of Congress on Tuesday to fire any Central Bank
executives who tried to block the measure.
</P>
<P>
	   The step means the Central Bank will lose control of much of Ecuador's
monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
	   Political analyst Cesar Montufar criticized the move, saying it would erode
the nation's sovereignty and make ``the president of the U.S. Federal Reserve''
Ecuador's true president.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of people gathered outside currency exchange offices early Monday
expressed mixed feelings about the announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   Luis Vargas, a merchant, was happy with the news.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We'll be able to work because we can bring merchandise from abroad and we
won't have to face this terrible variation in the value of the currency,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The sucre recently plunged 20 percent in less than a week to 29,000 to the
dollar. A year ago, the sucre was valued at 7,000 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahuad's announcement came after a tense week of street protests and rumors
that Ecuador's military was planning a coup. The military high command issued a
statement Saturday expressing support for Ecuador's democratically elected
government.
</P>
<P>
	   Business and labor leaders have accused Mahuad of incompetence, and several
leftist-led organizations demonstrated on Thursday in Ecuador's main cities to
demand Mahuad's ouster.
</P>
<P>
	   Police used tear gas to disperse 1,000 demonstrators who tried to march on
the presidential palace, and the government called a state of emergency, giving
the armed forces authority to maintain order and detain protesters.
</P>
<P>
	   Panama is the only other Latin American nation to use the U.S. dollar as its
official currency. The Central American country has avoided the inflation that
has afflicted other nations in the region, since it could not print currency to
back up excessive government spending.

<HEADLINE> Record Nasdaq Gain; Dow Has Record  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology and media shares led the Nasdaq composite to its
biggest point gain ever and the Dow Jones industrials to a new closing high as
investors celebrated the $166 billion planned merger of America Online and Time
Warner.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index rose 166.97 to 4,049.59, according to preliminary
calculations. The technology-dominated index has risen more than 300 points in
the past two sessions, wiping out most remnants of a three-day slump that
knocked 400 points off the Nasdaq last week.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow rose 49.64 to 11,572.20, topping Friday's record close of 11,522.56.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader market indicators were also higher.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 16.12 to 1,457.59.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 1,784 up, 1,356 down and 423 unchanged. On the Nasdaq Stock
Market, eight stocks rose for every five that fell.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume totaled 1.03 billion shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 1.21 billion in
the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller compa	   Technology stocks posted
eye-popping gains in a wide range of sectors. Internet service providers,
biotechnology companies and businesses that build computer networks all soared
in active trading on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
	   But the biggest story on Wall Street was AOL, whose bold move to acquire
Time Warner spurred a wave of speculation about additional mergers between
new-line and old-line information providers.
</P>
<P>
	   Time Warner soared and AOL slipped modestly after the announcement of their
deal, which would be the largest corporate merger ever.
</P>
<P>
	   AOL's quest for Time Warner, an old-line traditional media powerhouse, gave
investors added evidence that the Internet will be one of the most dominant
features in the economy of the future, traders said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This deal took great vision and courage," said Alan Ackerman, senior vice
president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. "It shows that the high valuations that many
analysts have been uncomfortable with may be justified."
</P>
<P>
	   Enthusiasm for the deal spread quickly to other Internet service providers
like Yahoo! and Lycos. Media companies like Disney and News Corp. also rose as
analysts forecast a wave of new partnerships.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts suggested the combination of AOL and Time Warner stimulated
interest in cable and wireless companies as well.
</P>
<P>
	   "A deal of this size indicates that we will start to see more
consolidation," said Robert Freedman, chief investment officer for the John
Hancock Funds in Boston. "There's a great deal of excitement surrounding these
industries."
</P>
<P>
	   Technology companies also provided the strongest boost to the Dow today.
Hewlett-Packard and IBM made solid advances.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past two sessions on Wall Street, technology stocks have returned to
the form that led the Nasdaq to an unprecedented 86 percent gain in 1999. Many
investors took profits from those gains last week, driving the Nasdaq 10 percent
lower over the course of three sessions.
</P>
<P>
	   Many analysts expected the Nasdaq to fall further. But investors' enthusiasm
for technology stocks, already running high, was kindled again by the AOL deal,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "These stocks had so much momentum that it's very tough to break their
cycle," said Freedman. "Shareholders appear ready and willing to buy on any
dips."
</P>
<P>
	   The industrial companies that led the Dow higher last week while technology
stocks languished continued to provide good news, but had a tough time
attracting as much attention as technology and media stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   Alcoa rose just slightly after reporting it earned 89 cents per share in the
fourth quarter. Analysts had anticipated earnings of 76 cents per share. Alcoa's
board also voted to raise the company's dividend and split its stock 2-for-1.
</P>
<P>
	   Corporate earnings for the recently ended fourth quarter are widely expected
to show strong growth, setting a stage for further gains by U.S. stocks. Later
this week, high-profile technology companies including Yahoo! and Intel will
release their fourth-quarter figures.

<HEADLINE> Israelis Demonstrate Vs. Syria Deal  </HEADLINE>
   By MARK LAVIE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- More than 100,000 Israelis demonstrated Monday
against the price Israel would likely pay for peace with Syria -- return of the
strategic Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
	   As Prime Minister Ehud Barak prepared to leave Shepherdstown, W.Va., after
the second round of Israel-Syria talks, leaders of the 17,000 Israelis who live
on the Golan Heights welcomed their supporters in the square in front of Tel
Aviv city hall.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will never leave the Golan Heights,'' declared Eli Malka, chairman of
the Golan Residents Committee, setting off cheers from the demonstrators.
Filling most of the square, they held banners and signs aloft with messages
including, ``The people are with the Golan'' and ``We will not leave the
Golan.''
</P>
<P>
	   Former Gen. Meir Dagan, just retired from his position as the government's
adviser on terrorism, warned that a Golan pullout would bring ''100 years of
terrorism'' into Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   In response to Barak's claim that failure to make peace would result in a
war, Dagan told the crowd, ``If we give back the Golan, there will also be a
war, and it will be bloodier and costlier than any other war in our history.''
</P>
<P>
	   Returning from the Shepherdstown talks Monday, Foreign Minister David Levy
said no progress was made.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no drawing of borders and there are no agreements,'' David Levy
told reporters. ``We can certainly not speak of results,'' he said, adding that
closing gaps between the two sides ``will have to wait for the next round.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Freishtat brought his 11-year-old son with him from Jerusalem to
demonstrate against concessions to Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are not to be trusted with a peace treaty,'' Freishtat, who moved
here 14 years ago from Silver Spring, Md., said Syria is a dictatorship and
shows no signs of change.
</P>
<P>
	   Farmer Yehoshua Weil, 52, faces eviction from the collective village of
Ramot if Israel gives up the Golan Heights. He sees the issue as more than a
matter of real estate. ``It's our home,'' he said, ``but it also appears to be a
change in the nation's values, that settlement is losing its importance.''
</P>
<P>
	   Although the turnout was impressive, organizers failed to produce what they
promised -- the largest demonstration in Israel's history -- reflecting a rift
between Golan Heights settlers and those from the West Bank. The record is
widely believed to be a demonstration against the war in Lebanon in 1982 that
drew between 300,000 and 400,000 protesters.
</P>
<P>
	   Leaders of the settlers in the West Bank were not prominent at the
demonstration. After joining forces at one point, Golan settlement leaders had
second thoughts.
</P>
<P>
	   Chaim Saperia, head of the Public Council for the Golan, said the joint
approach was a ``bad mistake.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the Golan settlers must appeal to Israel's moderates, while the West
Bank settlers are identified with hawkish ideologues. He said it was essential
to break the link to maximize support among Israelis, though the well-organized
West Bank settlers could have brought in thousands more demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak has pledged to put any agreement with Syria before the people in a
referendum.

<HEADLINE> 6 Turkish Soldiers, Rebels Killed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUNCELI, Turkey (AP) -- Clashes in southeastern Turkey killed six Kurdish
rebels and six Turkish soldiers, the Turkish military said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels also damaged a Turkish military helicopter in Sunday's clashes,
the military said.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S.-made Sikorsky transport helicopter was hit by rebel gunfire but
managed to land, the officials said, speaking on the customary condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   A statement by the Turkish military in Diyarbakir said six soldiers and six
``terrorists'' were killed in a clash in Tunceli, without giving details.
</P>
<P>
	   Military officials said the rebels were part of a breakaway Kurdish rebel
faction, which has rejected the peace initiatives of the Kurdistan Workers Party
or PKK.
</P>
<P>
	   But local civilian officials said the rebels were members of a different
group, the leftist Turkish Workers Peasants Liberation Army, which is fighting
to create a Marxist state in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
	   Tunceli is a stronghold for both groups, which have collaborated in the past
in attacks on Turkish forces.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials of the PKK's political wing in Europe said they did not know if
the fighting involved a breakaway group or retreating rebels, nor could they
confirm casualties.
</P>
<P>
	   The PKK has accused Turkish forces of attacking retreating rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   Fighting reportedly continued Monday. The Anatolia news agency said Turkish
forces backed by airpower had launched an operation to seek out a large group of
rebels in the mountainous area.
</P>
<P>
	   The PKK leadership announced a cease-fire and withdrawal from Turkey in
August. But top commanders warned last week against attacks from a breakaway
group aimed at undercutting ``the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan was sentenced to death for treason and
separatism for leading a 15-year insurgency for Kurdish autonomy in southeastern
Turkey. He has offered from prison to make peace and demanded a general amnesty
for his rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   Turkey has refused to negotiate with the PKK.

<HEADLINE> Pataki polishes 2000-01 budget; Bruno talks reform again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - With 5,000 criminals' DNA samples being collected
monthly, Gov. George Pataki said his state budget presentation to the
Legislature Tuesday will propose almost doubling state funds for genetic testing
and analysis.
<P>
	   Pataki said the value he places on the crime-fighting capabilities of DNA
will be reflected in the $11.8 million he will ask lawmakers to appropriate in
the new budget. That would be up from the $6.5 million the state is spending for
DNA programs in the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki is scheduled to release the 2000-01 spending plan on Tuesday. It will
be for the fiscal year beginning April 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the governor, the state DNA database has taken in 5,473 samples
since a new law expanding the scope of the project took effect on Dec. 1, 1999,
and officials expect about 5,000 samples to come in every month for the next
year and a half. People convicted of the most serious crimes had been required
since 1994 to submit samples, but starting in December more minor offenders were
also included under the database.
</P>
<P>
	   Inmates already in state prisons for committing certain crimes also became
subject to the DNA sampling program on Dec. 1 for the first time.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the funds for maintaining the database, the governor said he
would ask that $850,000 be distributed to the New York City Police Department,
the New York City Medical Examiner's Office, the Suffolk County Crime Lab, the
Westchester County Crime Lab and the State Police Forensic Center for
DNA-related purposes.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki said the four labs will be able to analyze evidence in 600 unsolved
cases while the NYPD will use the money to improve DNA crime scene collection
techniques.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile Monday, state Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno said he would
ask Pataki not to call any of the "three-men-in-a-room" budget meetings this
year. Those are the sessions, much criticized by reformers and many legislators,
where the governor, the Assembly speaker and the Senate majority leader sit
behind closed doors and hash out the most important aspects of new budgets and
other crucial matters.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm going to ask the governor not to call any, and the governor is the
governor and he'll do whatever he sees fit," Bruno said.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate comment from Pataki's office on Bruno's pledge.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno, who has advocated for a more public budget process, wouldn't pledge
not to go to any of the private meetings if Pataki decided to call them,
however.
</P>
<P>
	   "I guess it would depend on the time and the place," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno also said that he would advocate conference committees on budget
reform if the Assembly passed a budget reform package. The Senate will pass its
budget reform package Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "If the speaker will pass his package and we pass our package, yes,
absolutely, it's a very valid public forum," Bruno said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki's budget proposal will be his sixth as governor and the first for
Acting Budget Director Carole Stone. She was appointed by Pataki after the
state's former budget director, Robert King, was selected late last year as the
new chancellor of the State University of New York system.
</P>
<P>
	   During an appearance Monday near Buffalo to make an economic development
announcement, the governor tried to console Buffalo Bills' fans for their team's
heartbreaking last-second playoff loss over the weekend to Tennessee. The Bills
gave up a touchdown with three seconds to play on a kickoff in which many Bills'
fans thought Tennessee had illegally lateraled the ball forward.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki held up a sign Monday saying, "It was a forward pass.'

<HEADLINE> Carlos the Jackal Verdict Set  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- After a four-year trial, an accused terrorist and a former
accomplice of Carlos the Jackal will be sentenced next week in a bombing attack
on a French cultural center, a Berlin court said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Johannes Weinrich, 52, is charged with murder, five counts of attempted
murder and planting explosives in the Aug. 23, 1983, attack that killed one
person and injured 23 others at a French cultural center in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors have sought a sentence of life in prison. A verdict is scheduled
next Monday in the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Germany's longest-sought fugitive until his 1995 arrest in Yemen, Weinrich
is a former Red Army Faction member who also headed European operations for
international terrorist Carlos the Jackal in the 1970s and '80s.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors say the Berlin bombing was one in a series of unsuccessful
attempts to pressure France to free Carlos' lover and another member of his
terrorist gang from a French prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Carlos, a Venezuelan whose real name is Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, was arrested
in Sudan in 1994. He was handed over to France for trial for a string of
killings and bombings dating from 1975.

<HEADLINE> Hacker steals credit card information from online retailer  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) - Along with a hangover from Christmas credit card
bills comes a new headache: A hacker stole credit card numbers from an online
music retailer and released them on a Web site when the company would not pay
$100,000 ransom.
<P>
	   The cyber-espionage will have a minimal affect on CD Universe customers'
pocketbooks, but it will dissuade some novices from buying online and will
strike fear into other online retailers, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   The parent company of CD Universe, eUniverse of Wallingford, had not yet
determined how the Web site was compromised or how many customers may have been
affected.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no way to tell. It's not a good situation," said Brett Brewer, a
vice president of eUniverse.
</P>
<P>
	   Internet security specialists worked Monday to shore up CD Universe's Web
site, as the FBI tried to track down the hacker.
</P>
<P>
	   The New York Times reported the hacker claimed to have taken 300,000 card
numbers.
</P>
<P>
	   The hacker, a self-described 19-year-old from Russia using the name Maxim,
sent an e-mail to the Times boasting that he exploited a flaw in the software
used to protect financial information at CD Universe.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he sent a fax to the company last month offering to destroy his
credit card files in exchange for $100,000.
</P>
<P>
	   After he was rebuffed, he used a Web site called Maxus Credit Card Pipeline
to distribute up to 25,000 of the stolen numbers, said Elias Levy of
SecurityFocus.com, a computer security firm. The site was shut down Sunday.

<P>
	   CD Universe said it did not know whether any customers' credit card numbers
had been used to make unauthorized purchases, though the Times said the
extortionist claimed in e-mails that he used some of the numbers to obtain
money.
</P>
<P>
	   "We haven't had anybody call us and say, 'Hey, somebody just bought a car
with my credit card,"' Brewer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumers were wondering what to do next.
</P>
<P>
	   "I might put off buying music and stuff (on the Internet) until I find out
what happened," said Carol Schmaltz, 19, a student at DePaul University.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's scary," said Mark LeVoy, 34, a CPA. "It makes you stop and think for a
minute. You are pretty much trusting someone you haven't even seen to take care
of your money."
</P>
<P>
	   eUniverse got credit card companies to cancel customer numbers that had been
stolen and is notifying those cardholders by e-mail, Brewer said. He said the
credit card companies will automatically give those customers new cards.
</P>
<P>
	   "It is a public relations disaster of incredible scale for the company,"
said Charles Rutstein, an analyst at Forrester Research Inc. "In terms of the
actual consumer, their liability is at most $50 or zero. The problem is the loss
in consumer confidence."
</P>
<P>
	   In general, credit card holders are responsible for only up to $50 of any
unauthorized charge.
</P>
<P>
	   Melissa Shore, an analyst at Jupiter Communications, said for people who are
not yet comfortable shopping by computer, the hacker's exploits will make them
shy away even more.
</P>
<P>
	   A survey last year by Jupiter found that 65 percent of people who browsed
for merchandise by computer but did not buy online would be more likely to buy
if security were tightened.
</P>
<P>
	   She said CD Universe's experience will prompt other Internet retailers to
improve security.
</P>
<P>
	   CD Universe and many other online retailers saw a big boom this Christmas
season and busted open sales projections for music, movies, videos and games. CD
Universe's sales were $9.1 million last year and are projected to rise to $16
million this year, Brewer said.
</P>
<P>
	   For the Internet as a whole, sales this past holiday season climbed more
than 300 percent from the previous year to as much as $12 billion, above early
expectations that sales would double.
</P>
<P>
	   Such Internet crimes are expanding as courts and police try to catch up,
said James Adams, chief executive of Infrastructure Defense Inc., a
Virginia-based company that helps companies combat hackers.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a very popular line of business these days. The hacker has been seen
as a vandal, a sort of graffiti artist, as opposed to the armed burglar, which
is in many cases what he or she is," Adams said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the cyber-crimes are even more risk-free because most victims do not
publicize that their security has been compromised.
</P>
<P>
	   Law enforcement is trying to stress the importance of reporting hacking
incidents, said Christopher Painter, a federal prosecutor of computer crimes in
Los Angeles,
</P>
<P>
	   "They should come to law enforcement, and law enforcement can be discreet
about these things," Painter said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Minister Chided for UK Visit  </HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- Iran's foreign minister said Monday he is paying a heavy
price at home for being the first Iranian Cabinet official to visit Britain
since the 1979 Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
	   But things were not much easier in London, where about 30 protesters hurled
eggs and paint at Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi's limousine as he headed to a
45-minute meeting with Prime Minister Tony Blair. Police said a woman was
arrested and charged with criminal damage.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Council of Resistance in Iran, among the dissident Iranian
exile groups that dogged Kharrazi at the start of the two-day visit, said its
supporters were responsible.
</P>
<P>
	   Jewish demonstrators also mounted a two-hour vigil near Blair's Downing
Street office to demand the release of 13 Iranian Jews held for a year on spying
charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Kharrazi shrugged off the protests about his visit, which has aroused strong
opposition in Iran among anti-Western groups.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the legitimate right of people who are not involved in terrorist
activities to express themselves,'' he commented at a news conference with
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook.
</P>
<P>
	   Outside Cook's residence, a few dozen Iranian communists yelled ``Robin
Cook, shame, shame'' through megaphones.
</P>
<P>
	   Kharrazi said he had explained to Blair the difficulties the Iranian
administration faced in responding to Western overtures.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My Foreign Ministry is paying a high price ... in Iran for planning to
normalize relations with the United Kingdom,'' Kharrazi said in English. ``This
can be successful only if the British government participate.''
</P>
<P>
	   The meeting with Blair underlined the importance the Labor Party government
attaches to a visit it says is part of a policy of ``engagement'' to encourage
moderate elements in the onetime pariah state.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics, including some in the United States, regard the European moves as
premature while Iran continues to denounce Israel, criticize the Middle East
peace talks and support extremist groups, including Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
	   ``A very substantial lingering concern in Washington is whether Iran will
use the terrorist establishment it does support -- it is a state sponsor of
terrorism -- to wreck the peace process,'' said Steven Simon, assistant director
of the London-based International Institute of Strategic Studies.
</P>
<P>
	   Peter Temple-Morris, among the legislators on two parliamentary committees
who met Kharrazi, said the aim is to ``bring Iran completely back towards the
Western fold.''
</P>
<P>
	   Relations between Britain and Iran warmed after Iran ended support in
September 1998 for a ``fatwa,'' or religious edict, to kill British author
Salman Rushdie. Many Muslims found Rushdie's novel ``The Satanic Verses''
offensive and insulting to Islam.
</P>
<P>
	   Britain and Iran exchanged ambassadors in May for the first time since 1979.

   MIAMI (AP) -- A judge said Monday that her court has jurisdiction over the

his Miami relatives to fight for custody of him.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Rosa Rodriguez said she will listen to arguments

	   A hearing was set for March 6.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	   The Immigration and Naturalization Service ruled last week that the boy

<P>
	   Lawyers for Elian's Miami relatives filed a petition on Friday to appoint a
temporary guardian for the boy, a first step toward preventing his return to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The petition was filed on behalf of Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., issued a subpoena on Friday in an effort to delay
Elian's departure. The subpoena requires the boy to testify before a House
committee Feb. 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Monday, Vice President Al Gore questioned whether the INS has the
expertise to decide Elian's fate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'd like to see the dispute adjudicated in our courts, where traditionally
questions like what is best for this child are decided,'' Gore said in an
interview on NBC's ``Today'' show. He added: ``This child's mother died in an
effort to get her child's freedom.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore proposed that Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, ``come to a place
where he can speak freely and settle the matter.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the White House Monday, President Clinton would not comment on Gore's
comments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Well, anybody's free to express their opinion about this on whether they
think they did right or wrong,'' the president said. Like Gore, he also would
not comment on Burton's subpoena.
</P>
<P>
	   But Burton's subpoena drew fresh criticism from Robert Edgar, general
secretary of the U.S. National Council of Churches, which sent representatives
to visit Elian's father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Little Elian deserves to be reunited immediately with his biological
father and closest family members in Cuba,'' Edgar said in a statement. ``The
longer this whole process drags on, the more disconnected this small child
becomes from those who have raised him and who love him.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Miami, Elian and his relatives watched a Three Kings Day parade on Sunday
as citywide protests over plans to send him back to Cuba remained on hold.
</P>
<P>
	   The parade was a welcome celebration for the city, which earlier in the week
was beset by protests and traffic slowdowns incited by anti-Castro groups angry
by the INS decision to send Elian back to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   But the city was quiet Sunday, a day after Cuban-American leaders issued a
temporary halt to the demonstrations because of Burton's subpoena.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, a representative of the U.S. National Council
of Churches who visited Elian's father in Cuba, said the boy talks with his
father on the telephone every day from the relatives' home in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The father is very devoted to this child,'' the minister said Sunday from
New York. ``You can maybe fake a lot of stuff ... but the relationships clearly
were there.''

<HEADLINE> Mideast Talks End With No Accord  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SHEPHERDSTOWN, W.Va. (AP) -- Peace talks between Israel and Syria recessed
Monday without agreement on new borders or any other major elements of a
land-for-peace treaty despite rigorous American mediation.
</P>
<P>
	   As the two delegations packed to go home, State Department spokesman James
P. Rubin said they would resume negotiations on Jan. 19, probably in the
Washington area. ``We are on the right track,'' he said. He gave no indication
how the gaps might be closed quickly.
</P>
<P>
	   The basic shape of a treaty has been clear since Prime Minister Ehud Barak
took office last July. Israel would surrender virtually all the Golan Heights, a
strategic plateau on the Syrian frontier, for peace, provided security measures
are found to take the place of the highland Israel has held since the 1967
Six-Day War.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria insists on a pullback to the Sea of Galilee, thereby letting it
recover a stretch of land it captured in the 1950s. Another scenario would push
Israel back to borders set in 1923. Or patches of land might be swapped. But
Barak has not specified what line he wants drawn between Israel and an Arab
country with which Israel has fought three major wars.
</P>
<P>
	   In Tel Aviv, an estimated 100,000 Israelis massed in pouring rain to protest
Barak's apparent willingness to cede the Golan Heights for peace with Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   Demonstrating In Rabin Square, Tel Aviv's main plaza, where former Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin was assassinated for trying to make peace with
Palestinians, the mostly youthful crowd was smaller than previous rallies for
and against peace agreements.
</P>
<P>
	   Considering the weather, however, the protest appeared significant. Two of
Barak's ministers joined the demonstrators, as did several high-ranking military
officers. Polls show that support has dropped among Israelis for withdrawal from
the Golan since the talks began, largely because of coolness toward Israeli
negotiators by their Syrian counterparts.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have not resolved the border issue, but we are working on it,'' Rubin
said in Shepherdstown, ``and work will hopefully continue at the resumption of
the talks.''
</P>
<P>
	   Similarly, other tough issues were not resolved in eight days of talks at
this old West Virginia town, including peace terms, division of scarce water and
security measures.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not going to declare that a major obstacle has been overcome in any of
the particular areas,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We did not reach agreement. ... We did not even get near'' one, Israeli
Foreign Minister David Levy said on his return to Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   A source close to the Syrian delegation said the talks had not reached the
objective -- a commitment to withdraw to the Sea of Galilee.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Procrastination and maneuvering will never lead to ... peace because they
will keep the roots of occupation and instability in the region,'' the
government-run Syria Times said in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton, who intervened in the negotiations, some 70 miles from
the capital, for parts of five days and nights, said in Washington that he is
not discouraged.
</P>
<P>
	   ``These people really talked about the substance of their differences for
the first time,'' Clinton said. ``They were very open. They were very candid.
... They broke a lot of ground.''
</P>
<P>
	   But he said ``this is too tough'' to expect a quick breakthrough. ``These
are very difficult issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton is likely to play an active role in the next round as well. But
complicating his schedule is the visit of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on
Jan. 20, a day after Israeli and Syrian negotiations reconvene.
</P>
<P>
	   The president has pledged to push for the outline of a final settlement
between Israel and the Palestinians by mid-February. Last week, the two sides
broke a deadlock on a partial Israeli pullback on the West Bank, but they are
only beginning to grapple with far tougher issues, including Palestinian demands
for a state with part of Jerusalem as its capital.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said Monday he was ``quite hopeful'' Israel and the Palestinians
would meet the Feb. 13 deadline.

<HEADLINE> First lady opposes recognition of gay marriage  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton said Monday that she
favors full benefits for partners in homosexual relationships, but marriages
should be "between a man and a woman."
<P>
	   "Marriage has got historic, religious and moral content that goes back to
the beginning of time and I think a marriage is as a marriage has always been,
between a man and a woman," Mrs. Clinton said after a news conference on her
U.S. Senate campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
	   Gay groups whose endorsement may be sought by Mrs. Clinton expressed
disappointment. Tim Sweeney, spokesman for the Empire State Pride Agenda, said
the endorsement of benefits "rings a little hollow" when accompanied by the
refusal to recognize gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
	   "We expect and deserve from society the full support that married couples
receive," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   David Smith of the Human Rights Campaign in Washington said he was
disappointed in Mrs. Clinton's position on civil marriage.
</P>
<P>
	   "While domestic partnership recognition is important and we continue to work
toward achieving that recognition, it still represents a separate-but-equal
doctrine," Smith said.
</P>
<P>
	   New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who is expected to be Mrs. Clinton's
opponent in the Senate race, had no immediate comment, campaign spokesman Bruce
Teitelbaum said.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, Mrs. Clinton angered some gays by saying she would march in New
York City's annual St. Patrick's Day Parade, which excludes the Irish Lesbian
and Gay Organization.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Clinton said Monday that she would have voted for the Defense of
Marriage Act of 1996, which denied federal recognition of gay marriage and
allowed states to ignore same-sex unions licensed elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
	   However, she said there is no need for a similar provision in state law.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think that would be divisive, I don't think it's necessary. I think we
ought to provide partnership benefits and make it possible for people to do with
their loved ones what anyone in a relationship should be able to do."
</P>
<P>
	   On other topics:
</P>
<P>
	   - Mrs. Clinton said she generally supports putting school systems under
mayoral control, a long-sought goal of Giuliani, but stopped short of saying it
should happen under this mayor.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if she favored eliminating the city's Board of Education in favor of
mayoral control, she said, "I'm not against that. ... In general, I believe in
having the political leadership responsible for the biggest enterprise in the
city."
</P>
<P>
	   But the first lady implied that Giuliani could be a roadblock to such an
arrangement. Mayoral control worked in Chicago, she said, because "nobody
doubted that the mayor of Chicago really cared about the children of Chicago -
all the children of Chicago. ... If you've got a situation where there's a doubt
about that, then it might be difficult to bring about."
</P>
<P>
	   Teitelbaum noted that Giuliani has long supported doing away with the board
and added, "It is his political opponents in New York, many of whom are close to
Hillary Clinton, who have blocked that."
</P>
<P>
	   -The first lady took no position on the case of 6-year-old Cuban refugee
Elian Gonzalez, simply calling for a quick ruling and saying, "I would like to
see the politics taken out of this decision."
</P>
<P>
	   -She repeated an offer to "sit down with the Giuliani campaign to talk about
a way we could agree to ban soft money and independent expenditures," various
ways of skirting fund-raising limits.
</P>
<P>
	   -Mrs. Clinton said that because she moved to New York only this month, "It's
fair that people say to themselves, "Well, I want to be sure that she's
committed to New York, she cares about New York and she's going to fight for New
York.' And I think I will be able to demonstrate all three of those."
</P>
<P>
	   -She welcomed another new New Yorker, former Massachusetts Gov. William
Weld, a Republican who announced last week that he had moved with an eye toward
running for governor.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think it's great that New York is such an attractive place," Mrs. Clinton
said. "I've always wanted to live here so I'm glad to have people come from all
over the country."

<HEADLINE> Record Nasdaq Gain; Dow Has Record  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology and media shares led the Nasdaq composite to its
biggest point gain ever and the Dow Jones industrials to a new closing high as
investors celebrated the $166 billion planned merger of America Online and Time
Warner.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index rose 166.97 to 4,049.59. The technology-dominated
index has risen more than 300 points in the past two sessions, wiping out most
remnants of a three-day slump that knocked 400 points off the Nasdaq last week.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow rose 49.64 to 11,572.20, topping Friday's record close of 11,522.56.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader market indicators were also higher.
</P>
<P>
	   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 16.12 to 1,457.59.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 1,784 up, 1,356 down and 423 unchanged. On the Nasdaq Stock
Market, eight stocks rose for every five that fell.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume totaled 1.03 billion shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 1.21 billion in
the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller compa	   Technology stocks posted
eye-popping gains in a wide range of sectors. Internet service providers,
biotechnology companies and businesses that build computer networks all soared
in active trading on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
	   But the biggest story on Wall Street was AOL, whose bold move to acquire
Time Warner spurred a wave of speculation about additional mergers between
new-line and old-line information providers.
</P>
<P>
	   Time Warner soared and AOL slipped modestly after the announcement of their
deal, which would be the largest corporate merger ever.
</P>
<P>
	   AOL's quest for Time Warner, an old-line traditional media powerhouse, gave
investors added evidence that the Internet will be one of the most dominant
features in the economy of the future, traders said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This deal took great vision and courage," said Alan Ackerman, senior vice
president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. "It shows that the high valuations that many
analysts have been uncomfortable with may be justified."
</P>
<P>
	   Enthusiasm for the deal spread quickly to other Internet service providers
like Yahoo! and Lycos. Media companies like Disney and News Corp. also rose as
analysts forecast a wave of new partnerships.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts suggested the combination of AOL and Time Warner stimulated
interest in cable and wireless companies as well.
</P>
<P>
	   "A deal of this size indicates that we will start to see more
consolidation," said Robert Freedman, chief investment officer for the John
Hancock Funds in Boston. "There's a great deal of excitement surrounding these
industries."
</P>
<P>
	   Technology companies also provided the strongest boost to the Dow today.
Hewlett-Packard and IBM made solid advances.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past two sessions on Wall Street, technology stocks have returned to
the form that led the Nasdaq to an unprecedented 86 percent gain in 1999. Many
investors took profits from those gains last week, driving the Nasdaq 10 percent
lower over the course of three sessions.
</P>
<P>
	   Many analysts expected the Nasdaq to fall further. But investors' enthusiasm
for technology stocks, already running high, was kindled again by the AOL deal,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "These stocks had so much momentum that it's very tough to break their
cycle," said Freedman. "Shareholders appear ready and willing to buy on any
dips."
</P>
<P>
	   The industrial companies that led the Dow higher last week while technology
stocks languished continued to provide good news, but had a tough time
attracting as much attention as technology and media stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   Alcoa rose just slightly after reporting it earned 89 cents per share in the
fourth quarter. Analysts had anticipated earnings of 76 cents per share. Alcoa's
board also voted to raise the company's dividend and split its stock 2-for-1.
</P>
<P>
	   Corporate earnings for the recently ended fourth quarter are widely expected
to show strong growth, setting a stage for further gains by U.S. stocks. Later
this week, high-profile technology companies including Yahoo! and Intel will
release their fourth-quarter figures.

<HEADLINE> Nasal Spray Lowers Ill Kids' Anxiety  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- A nasal spray containing a drug similar to Valium reduced
anxiety in children undergoing painful cancer treatments, researchers found.
</P>
<P>
	   The study of 43 cancer-stricken Swedish children found that those given
midazolam in a nasal spray prior to having a needle inserted into them for
intravenous treatments were calmer and more comfortable than children given a
placebo.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the drug was tested only on children with cancer, researchers said
it could be used to ease anxiety in youngsters facing procedures for other
medical problems.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's interesting for children who are very much afraid, where you otherwise
would have to hold them down to carry through the procedure or immunization or
whatever," said Dr. Gustaf Ljungman, lead author of the study. It was published
in the January issue of the journal Pediatrics.
</P>
<P>
	   Ljungman is a pediatric cancer specialist at Uppsala University Children's
Hospital in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
	   In the study, the spray or a placebo was given before a needle was inserted
in an intravenous port, an opening left in cancer patients to avoid having to
insert an IV each time doctors need to administer a drug.
</P>
<P>
	   The children were later asked whether the spray had a calming effect,
whether it bothered them and if they would want the medication again. Parents
and nurses helped the children answer the questionnaires.
</P>
<P>
	   The main drawback to the spray, Ljungman said, is that some children
reported a burning sensation.
</P>
<P>
	   The study also noted that midazolam only reduced the children's anxiety and
not the pain associated with the treatment itself.

<HEADLINE> Gov't Seeks $50M for Great Lakes  </HEADLINE>
   By KATHERINE RIZZO Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government plans to ask for $50 million in next
year's budget to try and clean up the contaminated muck fouling Great Lakes
harbors and river bottoms.
</P>
<P>
	   Previewing the plan Monday, Vice President Al Gore said communities with the
31 most polluted sites on the U.S. side of the lakes would compete for the
matching funds.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People want to see the Great Lakes cleaned up,'' Gore said. ``After a
while, if an effort this size continues, it's going to have a huge impact.''
</P>
<P>
	   If provided by Congress, the money would be distributed on a 60-40 basis,
with the cost shared by state and local governments. In theory, that would
provide $80 million for cleanups.
</P>
<P>
	   Another $17 million worth of Great Lakes-targeted cleanup programs already
is planned, plus the region's share of Superfund money, Environmental Protection
Agency waterways financing and Army Corps of Engineers money for Great Lakes
work.
</P>
<P>
	   Environmentalists and advocacy groups contend all of that, including the new
money, remains far too small to deal with the needs of the 31 polluted sites,
which were designated along with a dozen localities in Canada as ``areas of
concern'' in 1987 by the U.S.-Canadian International Joint Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   Total need is ``in the billions,'' said Reg Gilbert of the international
anti-pollution coalition Great Lakes United. Once the $50 million is divided up,
he said, each site is unlikely to get enough to make much of a difference.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It takes $2 million just to build a wall around a 2-acre dump,'' he said.
``But if they dropped (the entire) $50 million into the Detroit Area of Concern
it would make a big difference for everyone around Lake Erie.''

<HEADLINE> Judge To Hear Cuba Boy Arguments  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEX VEIGA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- A judge said Monday that her court has jurisdiction over the
case of a 6-year-old Cuban boy and issued a temporary protective order that
keeps him in the United States until at least March, defying an Immigration and
Naturalization Service order that he be sent back by Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Rosa Rodriguez said she will listen to arguments
filed by the attorneys on behalf of Elian Gonzalez, an apparent positive first
step for the relatives to have their appeal for custody heard in a U.S. court. A
hearing was set for March 6.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found on Thanksgiving clinging to a raft off the coast of Fort
Lauderdale. His mother and stepfather drowned in the failed trip from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge said that the custody petition ``contains sufficient verified
allegations that if emergency relief is not granted and Elian is returned to
Cuba he would be subjected to imminent and irreparable harm, including loss of
due process rights and harm to his physical and mental health and emotional
well-being.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Immigration and Naturalization Service ruled last week that Elian should
be returned to his father in Cuba by Friday. President Clinton and Attorney
General Janet Reno have endorsed that ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate reaction from the Cuban government, which had
scheduled an evening pro-Elian rally in front of the U.S. Interests Section in
Havana. Calls placed to the office of Foreign Ministry spokesman Alejandro
Gonzalez rang unanswered.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for Elian's Miami relatives filed a petition on Friday, seeking to
have Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, appointed as his guardian. That would
allow him to seek political asylum for Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Friday, Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., issued a subpoena in an effort to
delay Elian's departure. The subpoena requires the boy to testify before a House
committee Feb. 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Monday, Vice President Al Gore questioned whether the INS has the
expertise to decide Elian's fate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'd like to see the dispute adjudicated in our courts, where traditionally
questions like what is best for this child are decided,'' Gore said in an
interview on NBC's ``Today'' show. He added: ``This child's mother died in an
effort to get her child's freedom.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore proposed that Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, ``come to a place
where he can speak freely and settle the matter.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the White House Monday, President Clinton would not comment on Gore's
comments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Well, anybody's free to express their opinion about this on whether they
think they did right or wrong,'' the president said. Like Gore, he also would
not comment on Burton's subpoena.
</P>
<P>
	   But Burton's subpoena drew fresh criticism from Robert Edgar, general
secretary of the U.S. National Council of Churches, which sent representatives
to visit Elian's father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Little Elian deserves to be reunited immediately with his biological
father and closest family members in Cuba,'' Edgar said in a statement. ``The
longer this whole process drags on, the more disconnected this small child
becomes from those who have raised him and who love him.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Miami, Elian and his relatives watched a Three Kings Day parade on Sunday
as citywide protests over plans to send him back to Cuba remained on hold.
</P>
<P>
	   The parade was a welcome celebration for the city, which earlier in the week
was beset by protests and traffic slowdowns incited by anti-Castro groups angry
by the INS decision to send Elian back to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   But the city was quiet Sunday, a day after Cuban-American leaders issued a
temporary halt to the demonstrations because of Burton's subpoena.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, a representative of the U.S. National Council
of Churches who visited Elian's father in Cuba, said the boy talks with his
father on the telephone every day from the relatives' home in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The father is very devoted to this child,'' the minister said Sunday from
New York. ``You can maybe fake a lot of stuff ... but the relationships clearly
were there.''

<HEADLINE> Philip Morris lobbyist's case referred to district attorney  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The Philip Morris tobacco lobbyist banned from
working in New York for violating state lobbying statutes may also face a
criminal investigation, state lobbying officials said Monday.
<P>
	   The state Lobbying Commission referred the case of Philip Morris lobbyist
Sharon Portnoy, who admitted violating state lobbying laws, to Albany County
District Attorney Sol Greenberg for prosecution.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission settled its investigation with Portnoy and Philip Morris by
banning the lobbyist from working in the state in the next three years and
fining the company $75,000. But it also has the power to ask for a criminal
investigation if it thinks violations were deliberate.
</P>
<P>
	   "The commission believed that the violation was willful," said David
Grandeau, the commission's executive director.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission investigated Philip Morris for not reporting some of the
gifts it gave to state lawmakers. State law requires lobbyists and their clients
to disclose all expenses, with a specific description of those expenses that
exceed $75.
</P>
<P>
	   It is illegal in New York to give lawmakers and officials any gifts worth
more than $75 if they are intended to influence their official duties.
</P>
<P>
	   Portnoy, Philip Morris' chief lobbyist, allegedly treated more than 60
lawmakers and their aides to more than $12,000 in meals in the first half of
1996 alone but few of those were publicly disclosed.
</P>
<P>
	   Philip Morris officials have said they were unaware of the improper lobby
filing, would cooperate with the Lobbying Commission's investigation and
wouldn't violate the law again.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission said the $75,000 fines it gave Philip Morris were the most it
could have handed down under state law.
</P>
<P>
	   The district attorney could charge Portnoy with falsely filing documents, a
Class A misdemeanor. The maximum penalty is a year in jail and fines of up to
$1,000, Greenberg said.
</P>
<P>
	   Greenberg said Monday he had not yet reviewed the file from the Lobbying
Commission, so he couldn't properly comment on it.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll look at what we have and we'll march from there," said Greenberg, who
also has to worry about the fallout of the Amadou Diallo police brutality case
being tried in his county this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The commission historically sends reports to the appropriate district
attorney, not the state attorney general, Grandeau said.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorney General Eliot Spitzer reacted angrily after hearing that the
commission referred the case to Greenberg, calling it "outrageous" that the
commission didn't ask for an investigation of Philip Morris itself. He said
asking for an investigation of Portnoy and not Philip Morris protects the
tobacco company from criminal sanctions.
</P>
<P>
	   "This action constitutes an abdication of the commission's statutory duties
and makes a mockery of statutory enforcement procedures," Spitzer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Spitzer had earlier asked for the go-ahead to prosecute both Portnoy and
Philip Morris. It was unclear Monday whether Greenberg and Spitzer can share the
jurisdiction in the case.
</P>
<P>
	   That troubled Blair Horner of the New York Public Interest Research Group.
</P>
<P>
	   "Our concern is that this doesn't fall into a prosecutorial black hole,"
Horner said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the state Senate on Monday passed a resolution saying its members
would not accept gifts from lobbyists at all if Assembly members did so as well.
Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno promised earlier that his Senate members
would not accept gifts anymore in light of the Portnoy case, and Democratic
senators soon followed suit.
</P>
<P>
	   A Democratic attempt to pass a rule binding the Republican-controlled Senate
to its promise failed.

<HEADLINE> Congress Moves on Cuban Boy Case  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Members of Congress are moving on various fronts to block
efforts to return Elian Gonzalez to his father in Cuba. One such tactic --
subpoenaing the 6-year-old boy to testify before a House committee -- was being
reviewed Monday by government lawyers.
</P>
<P>
	   Legislative activity was building as a state court judge in Miami asserted
jurisdiction, granted the boy's Florida relatives temporary custody and ordered
a March 6 hearing on the guardianship issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for the Justice Department and the Immigration and Naturalization
Service were evaluating the earlier congressional subpoena issued by Rep. Dan
Burton, chairman of the House Government Reform Committee, in an effort to delay
Elian's departure.
</P>
<P>
	   Also from Capitol Hill, Sen. Jesse Helms is seeking to make the boy a U.S.
citizen, while other lawmakers are weighing resident status for the father.
</P>
<P>
	   The subpoena issued late Friday requires the child to testify before his
committee Feb. 10. But Burton, R-Ind., does not expect to compel the boy to
appear, spokesman Mark Corallo said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS ruled last week that Elian, who was rescued from an inner tube in
the Atlantic Ocean on Thanksgiving Day after his mother drowned while fleeing
Cuba, should be returned to Cuba and his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, by
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Monday's court ruling in Miami appeared to have the same effect as Burton's
subpoena -- assuring Elian would not soon go back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Some committee members questioned whether the subpoena could be enforced,
anyway, given the boy's age and disagreement over who is his legal guardian.
</P>
<P>
	   Corallo said the subpoena was ``intended to give the courts a chance to hear
this case.'' If the boy is returned to Cuba, he said, Burton will subpoena INS
officials ``to explain to the American people why they would do such a thing.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Rep. Henry Waxman of California, the senior Democrat on the committee,
said the subpoena ``is unenforceable and shouldn't have any effect on the
proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Congressional subpoenas should be used for legitimate investigative
purposes, not political stunts,'' Waxman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms, R-N.C., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is
proposing legislation granting Elian full U.S. citizenship. Colleagues,
including Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., flocked to add their names
to the cause.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban President Fidel Castro ``has won a single round. He did not win the
war,'' said Sen. Robert G. Torricelli, D-N.J., one of the sponsors of the
citizenship bill, .
</P>
<P>
	   In the House, GOP Rep. Benjamin Gilman of New York, chairman of the
International Relations Committee, proposed that Elian's father be granted
resident status if he can make it to the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., a sponsor of the citizenship bill said she
and other members of the Florida delegation also might support such an approach,
although she wanted to give the Florida family a chance to be heard.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Despite all the international intrigue, this all boils down to a custody
battle,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   On the campaign trail, Al Gore broke ranks with President Clinton and
Attorney General Janet Reno in questioning the INS decision.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'd like to see the dispute adjudicated in our courts, where traditionally
questions like `what is best for this child' are decided,'' the vice president
said on NBC's ``Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he doubted that the INS had ``the experience and the expertise'' to
make a custody decision. Gore also cited a lack of compelling evidence that
Elian's father was sincere ``about what is in his child's best interest.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, continuing to support the INS, said Monday: ``I think the INS tried
to do what was right by the child and I think that they did the best they could
with a difficult and controversial situation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about Gore's comments, Clinton said, ``Well, anybody's free to express
their opinion about this.'' The president, addressing Burton's subpoena, just
said that Burton's moves were ``always interesting.''
</P>
<P>
	   Torricelli, who supports Burton's decision to issue the subpoena, said in an
interview, ``This is a legitimate area of policy inquiry'' and not an example of
congressional meddling. The senator visited the child in Miami last month.

<HEADLINE> Army Probing Gay Harassment  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Army on Monday said it will investigate alleged
anti-homosexual actions at Fort Campbell, Ky., during a period leading up to the
killing of a gay private by a fellow soldier there last summer.
</P>
<P>
	   The probe will be conducted by the Army's inspector general, Lt. Gen.
Michael Ackerman, ``in light of allegations that surfaced'' during the criminal
investigation of the murder and the recently concluded courts martial, Army
Secretary Louis Caldera said.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the allegations that arose during the criminal proceedings was that
relentless harassment of Pfc. Barry Winchell prior to his murder was reported to
Fort Campbell's inspector general but that no action was taken.
</P>
<P>
	   Caldera said Ackerman also would conduct an ``overall assessment of the
command climate'' at Fort Campbell, to shed light on attitudes and practices
there with regard to enforcing the Pentagon's policy on gays.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigation also will examine how the Defense Department's policy on
gays in the military is being implemented by commanders in the field throughout
the Army. The policy has come under increasing attack from critics in the
aftermath of the killing at Fort Campbell, and Defense Secretary William Cohen
last month ordered a 90-day review after President Clinton declared it was not
working as intended.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ackerman investigation was requested by the commander of Fort Campbell,
Maj. Gen. Robert T. Clark, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Ackerman will look into the harassment that witnesses said Winchell suffered
at Fort Campbell before he was beaten to death by a fellow soldier last July.
Last Saturday, a military court sentenced Winchell's roommate, Specialist Justin
R. Fisher, to 12 1/2 years in prison as part of a plea bargain. The deal enabled
Fisher to avoid more serious charges of being an accomplice to the murder and
helping cover it up.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, Pvt. Calvin Glover was convicted and sentenced to life in
prison for beating Winchell to death with a baseball bat.
</P>
<P>
	   Outrage over the incident has put a renewed spotlight on the effectiveness
of the Defense Department's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy of allowing gays to
serve in uniform so long as they keep their sexual orientation private. Critics
say that in practice the policy doesn't work because suspected gays are
threatened and harassed.
</P>
<P>
	   One sergeant who testified at Glover's trial said he had questioned Winchell
about his sexuality, which is a violation of the ``don't ask, don't tell''
policy.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers, activists call for feds to monitor Diallo trial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Further questioning the change in venue from the
Bronx to Albany, lawmakers and activists called on the U.S. Justice Department
Monday to monitor the upcoming murder trial of four police officers.
<P>
	   The New York State Black, Puerto Rican and Hispanic Legislative Caucus
argued that moving the trial to Albany is an attempt by the defendants to avoid
facing a predominately black and Hispanic jury pool and constitutes special
treatment for the police.
</P>
<P>
	   The four officers are accused of killing West African immigrant Amadou
Diallo in a hail of bullets after mistaking him for a rape suspect.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Diallo incident is another example that something is wrong with the
relationship between communities of color and law enforcement agencies,"
Democrat Assemblyman Keith Wright of Manhattan, chairman of the caucus, said.
"Now more than ever there is a need to take a look at how our police officers
are trained and prepared for the communities in which they perform their
duties."
</P>
<P>
	   Wright expressed particular concern that the percentage of black and
Hispanic jurors be representative of the community. The caucus is also
requesting that New York City and Albany residents be given access and seats in
the court room to monitor the trial.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawmakers also called Monday for the Justice Department to monitor the
trial to make sure there are no violations of civil rights. Justice Depatment
officials say they will pay close attention to the trial, making sure there are
no violations of federal law.
</P>
<P>
	   "There will be a lot of anger in the streets of Albany and in New York City
if justice is not served and that's the primary reason that we have requested
that the Justice Department monitor the trial," Wright said.
</P>
<P>
	   A grand jury indicted the plain clothes officers in March after they fired
41 bullets at Diallo, an unarmed street vender, while searching a Bronx
neighborhood for a rape suspect on Feb. 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for the officers - Kenneth Boss, Sean Carroll, Edward McMellon and
Richard Murphy - have said their clients mistakenly believed the victim was
reaching for a gun. The four officers were charged with second-degree murder and
all pleaded innocent. Jury selection in their trial is scheduled to begin on
Jan. 31.
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting touched off weeks of angry protests leading to more than 1,100
arrests. Activists had planned to demonstrate outside the Bronx courthouse once
the officers went on trial.
</P>
<P>
	   But in an extraordinary decision, a state appeals court moved the trial of
the officers to Albany. In its 11-page ruling, the court said it would be
impossible for the officers to get a fair trial in the Bronx because of media
treatment of the incident.
</P>
<P>
	   "No one is saying that justice won't be served, but we've asked the Justice
Department to monitor the trial just the same," state Sen. David Paterson, a
Manhattan Democrat and another member of the caucus, said. "Because if things do
go awry and there are problems, the Justice Department will be able to put into
process items that might prevent a similar incident occurring again."
</P>
<P>
	   Anne Pope, president of the Albany branch of the NAACP, compared the Diallo
trial to a recent incident in which 33-year-old Tracy Grady allegedly wrested a
gun from two Albany police officers and shot them before fleeing.
</P>
<P>
	   Following the incident, police swarmed through a black neighborhood dressed
in combat fatigues and helmets, allegedly using excessive force and brutalizing
residents in their search for the gunman.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are concerned to make sure that no one thinks Albany is a safe haven for
police who have acted brutally and irresponsibly, whether in New York City or
right here in our own neighborhoods," Pope said.
</P>
<P>
	   Diallo supporters in Albany Monday announced the formation of a Capital
Region Justice for Diallo Committee. Its members said they will "monitor" the
trial, provide support for members of Diallo family when they are in Albany for
the proceedings and to continue pushing for formation of a civilian review board
to oversee the activities of Albany police.

<HEADLINE> New media, old media: AOL buys Time Warner for $160 billion  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEW YORK (AP) - You've got mail. And movies. And music. And magazines.
<P>
	   In the most daring media merger yet, online pioneer America Online is buying
venerable Time Warner Inc., the largest media and entertainment conglomerate in
the world. The $160 billion stock deal would be the biggest corporate merger of
all time as well as an aggressive bet that online delivery of media is the wave
of the future.
</P>
<P>
	   "This merger will launch the next Internet revolution," said Steve Case,
America Online's chairman and chief executive, told a news conference. "We're
still just scratching the surface."
</P>
<P>
	   Case will be chairman of the new company, which will be called AOL Time
Warner Inc., and Time Warner chairman Gerald Levin will be its chief executive.
America Online shareholders will own 55 percent of the company, and Time Warner
shareholders the rest.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal marks a major turning point in the media industry, providing
irrevocable proof of the massive power and value that Internet companies like
AOL have built up over the past several years.
</P>
<P>
	   In combining the leading Internet company with the leading traditional media
company, the deal also shows that despite the many differences between vanguards
of "new media" and "old media," the two sides need each other more than ever
before.
</P>
<P>
	   AOL needed access not only to Time Warner's media content machine - which
produces films, music, TV shows and magazines - but also to Time Warner's large
network of cable TV lines, which is second only to AT&AMP;T's and reaches 20 percent
of U.S. households.
</P>
<P>
	   Time Warner, like other major media companies, has been in the middle of a
major effort to reinvent its own Internet strategy. Last year it named its chief
financial officer Richard Bressler to lead a company-wide charge to take
advantage of Internet opportunities and set aside $500 million to invest in
them.
</P>
<P>
	   With the AOL deal, Time Warner acquired a large, well-established online
platform for delivering its content to users, a goal it has had for some time.
"This really completes the digital transformation of Time Warner," Levin, said.
"These two companies are a natural fit."
</P>
<P>
	   At a news conference announcing the deal, Levin deliberately blurred the
lines on the question of which company was the "old media" and which was the
"new" one. Dressed in khaki pants, an open-collar shirt and sports coat while
all the AOL executives wore suits, Levin opened his remarks by saying: "It's a
great pleasure to welcome the suits from Virginia to New York."
</P>
<P>
	   Levin stressed the point that Time Warner itself was the product of a series
of large mergers, and Case said the experience in integrating disparate
companies was a major factor that drew him to the Time Warner management team.
</P>
<P>
	   Time Warner was formed 10 years ago, combining the entertainment company
that grew out of Warner Bros. movie studio with Time Inc., whose flagship
magazine Time was founded in 1923 by Henry Luce. Time Warner bought Ted Turner's
cable company TBS in 1996, which included the all-news channel, CNN, to add to
Time Warner's cable lineup of HBO and Cinemax.
</P>
<P>
	   AOL has been no stranger to deals itself since being formed in 1985. Last
year it acquired Netscape Communications and MovieFone, and it also bought
online competitor CompuServe and a stake in Hughes Electronics, a maker of
electronic equipment.
</P>
<P>
	   Painfully aware that telephone dialup connections are far too slow to
provide the kind of online services like TV, movies and music that people want,
AOL has been on a campaign to force cable providers to open up access to their
lines, which can provide much faster access than phone lines. Consumer groups
now fear that with AOL set to own a major cable provider, it may ease up on its
efforts to ensure "open access."
</P>
<P>
	   Coming just four months after the latest blockbuster media merger, the
proposed combination of CBS Corp. and Viacom Inc., also raised concerns from
consumer groups and senators about the increasing consolidation of ownership
among major media companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Mike DeWine, chairman of the antitrust subcommittee, said the deal
"raises a whole host of competition and public policy issues."
</P>
<P>
	   "Is this merger the effective beginning of the end of the Internet as an
effective counterweight to traditional media outlets, or is this just another
step on the road to making the Internet a more useful and viable source of
information?" said DeWine, a Republican from Ohio.
</P>
<P>
	   Several consumer advocacy groups, including the Consumers Union and the
Center for Media Education, released a joint statement expressing disappointment
with the deal, which it called the "sad result of the Clinton administration's
weak competition policy."
</P>
<P>
	   "Consumers do not want to be beholden to a giant media-Internet
dictatorship, even if it promises to be a benevelont one," the groups said. "We
want the Federal Communications Commission to require open access, regardless of
the promises made by the players."
</P>
<P>
	   Case said the company remains committed to providing consumers with as many
choices as possible, and predicted that the deal would result in several new
companies offering Internet access service.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal is subject to regulatory approvals and the approval of AOL and Time
Warner shareholders. The companies said the merger was expected to be finalized
by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department said Monday it was unclear whether it or the Federal
Trade Commission will be asked to approve the proposed merger. Each agency has
its own group of antitrust experts, and they typically split regulatory reviews
after deciding among themselves whose experts are most appropriate to decide the
questions that such a mega-meger might raise.
</P>
<P>
	   Case said he first approached Levin about a possible combination in October.
The fact that no advance word leaked out about the discussions was a sign that
the new executive team likes and trusts each other, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Turner, who owns 9 percent of Time Warner, where he is vice chairman, will
keep the title with the new company. He signed over his shares Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal values Time Warner at about $106.87 1/2 a share, a rich premium of
65 percent over its price of $64.75 a share late Friday. Time Warner shares
soared 39 percent on news of the deal, climbing $25.25 to $90 a share as of the
4 p.m. EST close of the New York Stock Exchange. AOL shares fell $2.50 to $7.25,
which caused the value of the deal to fall from $166 billion when the
acquisition was announced before stock markets opened.
</P>
<P>
	   Other Internet and entertainment stocks also got a lift on anticipation of
other deals. Among them, Walt Disney jumped $4.75 to $35.87 1/2 and News Corp.
rose $7.31 1/4 to 45.06 1/4 on the NYSE, while Lycos leaped $9 to $79.75 and
Yahoo! climbed $28.81 1/4 to $436.06 1/4 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   Wall Street analysts were bullish on the deal, saying it extended the reach
of both companies. "It makes a lot of sense," said Tom Wolzien, media analyst at
Sanford C. Bernstein &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
	   The transaction would surpass the biggest proposed takeover before Monday,
the $150 billion hostile bid for German telecommunications company Mannesmann by
Britain's Vodafone, the world's largest mobile phone company.

<HEADLINE> Time Warner-AOL deal could have ripple effect for studios  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   LOS ANGELES (AP) - Big entertainment companies such as Disney and Sony
may find they need to strike more Internet deals of their own now that Time
Warner is being acquired by America Online.
<P>
	   The sheer scope of the Time Warner-AOL deal could set off a fresh round of
mergers or partnerships between studios with big film, television and music
libraries and Internet companies hungry for entertainment content, analysts said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everybody on the Internet side of the street and the media side have to be
re-evaluating their plans today, because this merger creates an 800-pound
gorilla," said Dan O'Brien, an Internet analyst with Forrester Research.
"Everyone has the same goal in mind to combine content and access."
</P>
<P>
	   Besides gaining content, Internet companies with few tangible assets can
insulate themselves from stock market volatility by merging with traditional
entertainment companies, said David Davis, an entertainment analyst with
investment banker Houlihan Lokey Howard and Zukin.
</P>
<P>
	   "AOL wanted to get more global. Now that they're armed with all those Time
Warner brands, it increases their chances of being successful," said Larry
Petrella, analyst with Lehman Brothers. "Arguably, that hurts everybody else a
little bit."
</P>
<P>
	   And with the Web becoming a bigger player in entertainment distribution,
analysts say studios will need better Internet connections to remain
competitive.
</P>
<P>
	   Potential technology players that could be looking to align themselves with
entertainment companies include Microsoft, AT&AMP;T and Yahoo!. Besides Disney and
Sony, media companies that could be looking for new high-tech partners include
News Corp.; Viacom, which is merging with CBS; and MGM, which has been losing
money for more than a decade but has a stellar film library.
</P>
<P>
	   Media companies also might look to acquire smaller Internet providers "to
keep their profile higher in the marketplace," Petrella said.
</P>
<P>
	   With its acquisition of Internet portal Infoseek, Disney is trying to build
up its presence on the Web. A Disney spokeswoman said the company would have no
comment on whether the AOL-Time Warner deal would affect its Internet plans.
</P>
<P>
	   Disney, its stock slumping as earnings plunged 28 percent last year, could
become an attractive takeover target for technology companies, O'Brien said. The
company has been slow to recognize the value of pushing its entertainment
content over the Internet, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "Traditional media companies have had a hard time understanding the dynamics
of the Web," O'Brien said. "It's not just a matter of digitizing your content,
setting up a site and expecting people to beat a path to your door. It doesn't
work that way."
</P>
<P>
	   While Time Warner and AOL may have the momentary edge, other media companies
have not necessarily been left behind, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "One guy going out and being successful doesn't mean anybody else can't,"
Petrella said. "Viacom and CBS have a big future in their own right. Disney just
needs to execute better. To some extent, these companies just have to stick to
their knitting, what got them there in the first place."

<HEADLINE> Judge To Hear Cuba Boy Arguments  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEX VEIGA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- A judge issued an order today blocking a Cuban boy at the
center of an international custody battle from returning to Cuba before March,
defying an Immigration and Naturalization Service order that he be sent back by
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Rosa Rodriguez said she will listen to arguments
filed by the attorneys on behalf of Elian Gonzalez, a positive step for his
Miami relatives who want their appeal for custody heard in a U.S. court. A
hearing was set for March 6.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found on Thanksgiving clinging to a raft off the coast of Fort
Lauderdale. His mother and stepfather drowned in the failed trip from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge said that the custody petition ``contains sufficient verified
allegations that if emergency relief is not granted and Elian is returned to
Cuba he would be subjected to imminent and irreparable harm, including loss of
due process rights and harm to his physical and mental health and emotional
well-being.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Immigration and Naturalization Service ruled last week that Elian should
be returned to his father in Cuba by Friday. President Clinton and Attorney
General Janet Reno have endorsed that ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate reaction from the Cuban government, which had
scheduled an evening pro-Elian rally in front of the U.S. Interests Section in
Havana. Calls placed to the office of Foreign Ministry spokesman Alejandro
Gonzalez rang unanswered.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for Elian's Miami relatives filed a petition on Friday, seeking to
have Elian's great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzalez, appointed as his guardian. That would
allow him to seek political asylum for Elian.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Friday, Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., issued a subpoena in an effort to
delay Elian's departure. The subpoena requires the boy to testify before a House
committee Feb. 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier Monday, Vice President Al Gore questioned whether the INS has the
expertise to decide Elian's fate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'd like to see the dispute adjudicated in our courts, where traditionally
questions like what is best for this child are decided,'' Gore said in an
interview on NBC's ``Today'' show. He added: ``This child's mother died in an
effort to get her child's freedom.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore proposed that Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, ``come to a place
where he can speak freely and settle the matter.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the White House Monday, President Clinton would not comment on Gore's
comments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Well, anybody's free to express their opinion about this on whether they
think they did right or wrong,'' the president said. Like Gore, he also would
not comment on Burton's subpoena.
</P>
<P>
	   But Burton's subpoena drew fresh criticism from Robert Edgar, general
secretary of the U.S. National Council of Churches, which sent representatives
to visit Elian's father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Little Elian deserves to be reunited immediately with his biological
father and closest family members in Cuba,'' Edgar said in a statement. ``The
longer this whole process drags on, the more disconnected this small child
becomes from those who have raised him and who love him.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Miami, Elian and his relatives watched a Three Kings Day parade on Sunday
as citywide protests over plans to send him back to Cuba remained on hold.
</P>
<P>
	   The parade was a welcome celebration for the city, which earlier in the week
was beset by protests and traffic slowdowns incited by anti-Castro groups angry
by the INS decision to send Elian back to his father in Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   But the city was quiet Sunday, a day after Cuban-American leaders issued a
temporary halt to the demonstrations because of Burton's subpoena.
</P>
<P>
	   The Rev. Joan Brown Campbell, a representative of the U.S. National Council
of Churches who visited Elian's father in Cuba, said the boy talks with his
father on the telephone every day from the relatives' home in Miami.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The father is very devoted to this child,'' the minister said Sunday from
New York. ``You can maybe fake a lot of stuff ... but the relationships clearly
were there.''

    NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks that are moving substantially or trading heavily
today on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq Stock Market.
</P>
<P>
	   AOL is acquiring Time Warner for about $166 billion in stock in what would
be the biggest corporate merger ever. America Online shareholders would own 55
percent of the combined company, which will be called AOL Time Warner Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   Liberty Media owns 9 percent of Time Warner shares.

<HEADLINE> Senate, Assembly approve 20-year police retirement  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The Senate and Assembly simultaneously approved a
bill Monday to allow police officers and paid firefighters to retire with
pensions after 20 years and to give pensions to widows whose spouses die while
off-duty.
<P>
	   Currently, municipal and city police officers and firefighters qualify for
retirement benefits after 25 years, and the survivors of deceased police
officers or firefighters receive a standard, lump-sum payment as life insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   The approval of expanded benefits came despite opposition from municipal
officials who fear millions in higher costs because of the contributions they
have to make to the pension system.
</P>
<P>
	   William Dressel, director of the state League of Municipalities, called the
vote a major disappointment to his group but a triumph for police unions to
force a vote in both houses on the last day of the legislative session. He said
unions applied "incredible pressure to get this done."
</P>
<P>
	   The enhanced pension benefits were unanimously opposed by the state's
Pension and Health Benefits Review Commission, an advisory panel that counts
among its members Treasurer Roland Machold and Personnel Commissioner Janice
Mintz.
</P>
<P>
	   But advocates of the proposal said state estimates of a $52 million annual
cost were exaggerated.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, one sponsor, Sen. Diane Allen, R-Burlington, claimed during floor
debate that features of the bill permitting changes in how the pension system's
assets are used should allow municipal governments to avoid any higher costs.
</P>
<P>
	   It is not clear if the opposition from Machold and the pension commission
will translate into a veto from Gov. Christie Whitman.
</P>
<P>
	   "There have been some amendments. We are trying to get a handle on how
costly they are," said Whitman spokesman Peter McDonough.
</P>
<P>
	   The bills, S-1742 and A-2328, would require the pension fund to have $338
million more than is now available in it.
</P>
<P>
	   Machold's office concluded that plugging this hole would require annual
payments starting at $52 million, $39 million of it from municipal governments
and $13 million from the state budget.
</P>
<P>
	   The costliest benefit, paying pensions to widows, would require increased
annualpayments of $27 million into the pension system from cities and towns,
treasury officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   But bill sponsors and the Office of Legislative Services said steady growth
in the pension funds' Wall Street holdings may add enough value to offset any
need for higher payments.
</P>
<P>
	   Under current law, local police officers and paid firefighters can retire
after 25 years with an annual pension payment set at 65 percent of their highest
annual salary. If they wait until 30 years to retire, the pension is set at 70
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill would allow retirement at 20 years with pension set at 50 percent
of salary.
</P>
<P>
	   Under current law, when police and firefighters die before retirement from
illness or an off-duty accident, spouses get a lump sum payment equal to 3 1/2
years' salary. The widow of a police officer earning $50,000 a year would
receive $175,000.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill proposes giving spouses a lifetime pension at 50 percent of salary.
State troopers' families have this benefit.
</P>
<P>
	   One sponsor, Assemblyman John Kelly, R-Essex, said he kept the bill simple
by matching State Police benefits. He said the 20-year retirement benefit would
not add cost nor would it trigger an exodus from the ranks, noting that few
troopers take advantage of early retirement.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court: $175,000 award to AC cop should stand  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday upheld a
$175,000 award to a veteran police officer who was sexually harassed by
colleagues and supervisors.
<P>
	   Without comment, the justices rejected an appeal by the Atlantic City Police
Department, which said Sgt. Donna Hurley's 1996 award was due in part to a
flawed instruction to jurors.
</P>
<P>
	   Hurley, the first woman in the department to reach the rank of sergeant,
accused supervisors and fellow officers of harassing her with obscene comments
and drawings. Once, she said, a sanitary napkin with sergeant's stripes was hung
above the podium where she conducted daily roll call. Another time, someone hung
one from the rearview mirror of her patrol car.
</P>
<P>
	   The harassment was condoned by department officials, who passed her over for
promotion, she said in her 1993 civil suit.
</P>
<P>
	   A jury originally awarded her $1.2 million, but the amount was later reduced
to $875,000 by U.S. District Judge Joseph Irenas in Camden.
</P>
<P>
	   On appeal, the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the $175,000 in
compensatory damages but ordered a new trial on the $700,000 punitive damages
verdict.
</P>
<P>
	   The new trial has yet to be scheduled. Lawyers for both sides were waiting
for the outcome of the Supreme Court case before returning to court, according
to Dennis Tuohy, the police department's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
	   The police department's appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court said that the
jurors should not have been presented with a quid pro quo theory of liability in
regard to Hurley's claims against Capt. Henry Madamba.
</P>
<P>
	   Hurley claimed that Madamba asked her to have sex with him, promising a
promotion if she did and retaliation if she didn't. But Madamba denied it and
Hurley's lawyer never offered evidence that she was punished for rejecting the
alleged advances, Tuohy said.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result, Tuohy said, there was no quid pro quo - a Latin expression
meaning "something for something."
</P>
<P>
	   Neither Madamba nor then-Chief Nicholas Rifice was found liable in the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Hurley and her lawyer, Clifford Van Syoc of Cherry Hill, could not be
reached for comment on the ruling Monday. The telephone rang unanswered at her
office in the police department's community relations division.
</P>
<P>
	   Van Syoc was trying a case, according to a woman who answered the telephone
at his Cherry Hill law office.

<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology and media shares led the Nasdaq
composite to its biggest point gain ever and the Dow Jones
industrials to a new closing high as investors celebrated the $160
billion planned merger of America Online and Time Warner. The
Nasdaq composite index rose 166.97 to 4,049.59, according to
preliminary calculations. The technology-dominated index has risen
more than 300 points in the past two sessions, wiping out most
remnants of a three-day slump that knocked 400 points off the
Nasdaq last week. The Dow rose 49.64 to 11,572.20, topping Friday's
record close of 11,522.56. Technology stocks posted eye-popping
gains in a wide range of sectors. But the biggest story on Wall

wave of speculation about additional mergers between new-line and
old-line information providers.

AOL To Buy Time Warner for $160B 
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Time Warner stock soared about 39 percent today
on news of its planned merger with America Online. Aol stock was
down 2 1/2 at 71 1/4 but Time Warner was up 25 5/16 at 90 1/4. Time Warner,
the world's largest media and entertainment company, is being
acquired by America Online for about $160 billion in stock in what
would be the biggest corporate merger ever. The deal announced
today raises the stakes in the consolidation scramble in the media
industry and comes just four months after another blockbuster media
merger, the proposed combination of CBS Corp. and Viacom Inc. The
deal is subject to certain conditions, including regulatory
approvals and the approval of AOL and Time Warner shareholders. The
companies said the merger was expected to be finalized by the end
of the year.

the top of the list as a similar report by the conservative

	   DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors continued its international
shopping spree Monday, picking up the 50 percent of Swedish luxury
automaker Saab Automobile AB that it does not already own. The
deal, terms of which were not disclosed, was the latest GM has made
with foreign automakers as it shores up positions in overseas
markets. Last year, GM bought 20 percent of Subaru, agreed to buy
engines from Honda and began negotiations to buy struggling Korean
automaker Daewoo. GM bought a 50 percent stake and management
control of Saab in December 1989 for $600 million and a $100

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Three companies agreed today to modify coupon
and cash rebate programs that federal regulators called ``false and
misleading.'' Bumble Bee Seafoods, Memtek Products and UMAX
Technologies reached agreements with the Federal Trade Commission
to compensate some consumers and speed rebates to others. The
public has until Feb. 9 to comment before the FTC decides whether
to make the agreements final. None of the companies admitted any

	   Aetna May Split Off Online Ventures
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Aetna, the nation's largest health insurer, is
considering spinning off its online health division into a separate
public company. The Hartford, Conn.-based Aetna may combine its
popular InteliHealth Internet site with its other online services
into a separate subsidiary, spokeswoman Joyce Oberdorf said today.
A decision is expected by this summer. InteliHealth.com, a joint
venture with Johns Hopkins Health System, is one of the most
visited health care sites on the Internet. Taking the online
division public would help Aetna's stockholders because they would
get a piece of an Internet company at a time when such entities are
the rage on Wall Street.

Atlantic provide long-distance in New York, SBC filed an
application with the FCC seeking to do the same in Texas.

<HEADLINE> Farm Program May Add Income Aid  </HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration will propose ``significant
changes'' in federal farm programs this year to provide growers with more
assistance when crop prices are low, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have an obligation to bring some specific proposals to the table and we
will,'' Glickman said.
</P>
<P>
	   He declined to discuss the recommendations under discussion, which are
expected to be part of the president's proposed 2001 budget. But the
administration has been developing a new subsidy program that would be tied to
swings in farm income and is similar to a plan proposed last year by Rep.
Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, according to congressional aides who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The devil is in the details. The difficulty has always been coming up with
something that you can reach a coalition, a consensus, about,'' Glickman said at
a news conference where he outlined his priorities for 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress has approved multibillion-dollar bailouts of the farm economy in
each of the past two years following a collapse in grain prices in 1998 and
economists expect little improvement in 2000. The government predicts farmers'
crop receipts will drop about 2 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Last Friday, the administration announced that the 2001 budget would include
an extra $1.3 billion for farm conservation programs, partly to help farmers
cope with the depressed commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Monday, Glickman said that the government was unlikely to require the
labeling of food that contains genetically-engineered ingredients. Despite
pressure from consumer groups, the administration insists that biotech crops are
essentially the same as crops bred by conventional means.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton said last fall that Congress needed to ``revise, revamp
and improve'' the 1996 Freedom to Farm law because it did not take adequate care
of farmers when crop prices dropped significantly. The measure, which Clinton
signed into law, ended a Depression-era system of price supports and replaced it
with fixed annual payments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The last two years we've just thrown money at the issue,'' said Tom Buis,
a lobbyist for the National Farmers Union. ``It's time to fix the structural
problems. The safety net is one of those problems that needs to be addressed.''
</P>
<P>
	   Glickman all but ruled out proposing restrictions on what farmers can grow,
saying, ``I doubt we're going back to the old days of micromanaging
production.'' Prior to 1996, farmers had to abide by government planting
restrictions if they wanted federal subsidies.
</P>
<P>
	   Stenholm's plan would provide payments to farmers when prices fall
significantly below average. The size of the checks would be tied to local crop
yields. The idea is to guarantee farmers a minimum level of income each year and
ensure the cash goes to farmers, not landowners, as some subsidies now do.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, Larry Combest of
Texas, is holding hearings around the country in February and March on revising
the 1996 farm law and has indicated interest in Stenholm's proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   But his Senate counterpart, Richard Lugar, R-Ind., has so far resisted
considering any changes in the law. He said Monday he looked forward ``to
reviewing the details'' of the administration's proposals.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will follow prices closely again this year to determine the best course
for American agriculture within the context of the 7-year contract the federal
government made with American farmers in the 1996 farm bill,'' said Lugar.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., said Lugar would be under more pressure to
reconsider his position once the administration makes its recommendations.
``Lugar is kind of the last holdout,'' Dorgan said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Launches China WTO Campaign  </HEADLINE>
   By TERENCE HUNT AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, stung by the collapse of global trade
talks at Seattle, urged Congress to vote ``at the earliest possible time'' on a
trade deal with China to keep it from becoming embroiled in election-year
politics.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton launched a drive Monday to line up votes for granting China
permanent normal trading relations with the United States as part of a deal to
allow the world's most populous nation to join the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This agreement is a good deal for America,'' the president said. U.S.
companies would gain better access to China's market in every sector from
agriculture to telecommunications to automobiles as Beijing cuts tariffs on
American goods by half or more over five years, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The China agreement likely will be the last major trade initiative of
Clinton's presidency. Clinton named Commerce Secretary William Daley and Steve
Ricchetti, deputy chief of staff in the White House, to lead the congressional
effort.
</P>
<P>
	   The campaign faces stiff resistance from organized labor, environmental
groups and their Democratic allies, who believe that low wages and lax pollution
standards in China will undercut American workers. Religious groups are expected
to raise objections about China's human rights problems.
</P>
<P>
	   On the other hand, Clinton is counting for support from Republican lawmakers
and American business, which is eager to dive into China's huge market. Thomas
Donahue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, praised Clinton's selections
of Daley and Ricchetti.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Daley brings the sophistication of a commerce secretary who has traveled
around the world and the background of a Chicago politician. That is just what
we need,'' Donahue said.
</P>
<P>
	   Donahue said the business community would mount an all-out lobbying campaign
and cautioned lawmakers against trying to delay a vote trying to take the issue
into the fall campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president was right on target when he said we have to move
aggressively and quickly,'' Donahue said. ``People who try to use this as an
election-year political issue will find themselves in an unhappy situation with
the business community.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president said chances for approval are ``quite good if we can get a
vote early in the year. I think this is something that is in the national
interest. I have made it clear to the leaders of Congress that I strongly
support it and that I think it should be scheduled for a vote at the earliest
possible time.
</P>
<P>
	   ``And if we do that,'' he said, ``I think we've got an excellent chance to
pass it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., chairman of the House Rules Committee and a
leader on trade matters, urged Clinton to exert his influence on reluctant
Democrats rather than rely wholly on Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am certain that if the president can convince a majority of Democrats in
the House to support him on this important trade initiative that we will prevail
in Congress,'' Dreier said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's trade campaign suffered a major setback last year when World Trade
Organization talks in Seattle failed under the weight of massive street protests
and internal bickering among the 135 nations in the WTO.

<HEADLINE> T-bill Interest Rates Down in Sale  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury securities fell in
Monday's auction.
</P>
<P>
	   The Treasury Department sold $7.5 billion in three-month bills at a discount
rate of 5.235 percent, down from 5.360 percent last week. An additional $6.5
billion was sold in six-month bills at a rate of 5.420 percent, down from 5.585
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The three-month rate was the lowest since Dec. 13, 1999, when the bills sold
for 5.210 percent. The six-month rate also was the lowest since Dec. 13 when the
rate was 5.410.
</P>
<P>
	   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors -- 5.392
percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,867.70 and
5.665 percent for a six-month bill selling for $9,726.00.
</P>
<P>
	   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the average yield
for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for making changes in
adjustable rate mortgages, rose to 6.03 percent last week from 5.95 percent the
previous week.

<HEADLINE> Palladium Futures At New High  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Palladium futures surged to another all-time high Monday on the New York
Mercantile Exchange in a continuing rally resulting from tight world supplies
and uncertainty about exports from Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   In other commodities markets, corn prices reached a two-month high and
coffee jumped after a long-awaited estimate pegged the crop lower than expected
in Brazil, the world's No. 1 producer.
</P>
<P>
	   Palladium has pushed through its previous price ceiling several times in
recent weeks because of the lack of Russian exports on the market. Russia is by
far the world's leading producer of the metal, which is used heavily in
automobile catalytic converters and to a lesser extent for electronics,
dentistry and jewelry.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian officials are still trying to undo a bureaucratic tangle that has
prevented the metal's sale by the nation's export agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Acting President Vladimir Putin has signed platinum export quotas for this
year, but it remains uncertain what will happen with palladium.
</P>
<P>
	   Palladium for March delivery settled up $8.05 at $451.95 per ounce after
hitting an all-time high of $456.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have seen considerable demand in this market for the last several weeks,
hence the reason for new highs, it seems, every other day," said David Meger,
senior metals analyst for Alaron Trading in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
	   He said Moscow is expected to resume palladium exports within a month, but
"until the actual product hits the market, there is going to be a lot of
uneasiness."
</P>
<P>
	   Corn's modest rise of late on the Chicago Board of Trade is attributed to
bullish sentiments that the long price slump may be over. On Monday, it also was
helped by news that the U.S. Department of Agriculture has received partial
funding for its food aid program, which could result in shipments to Russia that
would ease the U.S. grain glut.
</P>
<P>
	   March corn rose 1 1/2 cents to $2.08 1/2 a bushel.
</P>
<P>
	   Coffee traders went on a buying spree early in the session at New York's
Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa Exchange after respected agronomist Leon Yallouz estimated
Brazil's drought-affected 2000-01 crop at 25 million to 27.5 million 60-kilogram
(132-pound) bags -- 1-2 million bags less than had been expected.
</P>
<P>
	   The drought slashed production from what was once pegged at a bumper crop of
40 million bags.
</P>
<P>
	   Some Brazilian experts cautioned, however, that it's still too early to get
an accurate reading on the crop, and the price fell back after surging.
</P>
<P>
	   March coffee ended up 3.6 cents at $1.1175 a pound after initially rising
11.85 cents.

<HEADLINE> Alcoa Earnings Up 53 Percent  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Alcoa's fourth-quarter earnings rose 53 percent, beating
Wall Street expectations, as the No. 1 aluminum maker cut back on its inventory
and also paid less tax on its operations in Australia.
</P>
<P>
	   Alcoa also announced Monday it was raising its dividend and spliting its
stock.
</P>
<P>
	   The company reported earnings of $333.9 million, or 89 cents per share,
compared with $218.3 million, or 59 cents per share, in 1998's fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts surveyed by First Call/Thomson financial had predicted earnings of
76 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
	   Revenue rose 1 percent to $4.2 billion to $4.25 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Alcoa's stock, which has risen sharply so far this year as investors have
embraced the stocks of manufacturers such as Alcoa, fell 25 cents Monday to
$84.37 1/2 a share in trading at 5:15 p.m. on the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Alcoa said it had a $31 million, or 8 cent per share, benefit from inventory
reductions. It also attributed its performance to a drop in its Australian tax
rate, from 29.9 percent from 32 percent a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   The company also reported an increase in its administrative costs during the
latest quarter. But CEO Alain Belda said in a statement that Alcoa's operations
have become more streamlined.
</P>
<P>
	   For all of 1999, the company said earnings went up 23 percent. Net income
was $1.05 billion, or $2.82 per share, compared with $853 million, or $2.42 per
share, for 1998. The company said it was the first time its one-year earnings
surpassed $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Full-year revenues came to $16.32 billion, up from $15.34 billion in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said it was raising the quarterly dividend on its common stock
to 25 cents a share from 18.75 cents. On an annual basis, the dividend is rising
to $1 per share from 75 cents.
</P>
<P>
	   Alcoa's board also voted to split the company's stock 2 for 1. The split,
subject to shareholder approval at the company's annaul meeting May 12, is
scheduled to take effect June 9 for shareholders who hold Alcoa stock on May 26.

<HEADLINE> Trucks, SUVs Crowd Detroit Auto Show  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DETROIT (AP) -- The U.S. auto market may look a bit crowded with sport
utility vehicles, but Toyota believes there's still room for its new giant.
</P>
<P>
	   Muscling in on the brawny segment, the Japanese automaker on Monday
introduced the Sequoia during the North American International Auto Show as its
largest SUV, comparable in size to Ford Motor Co.'s Expedition.
</P>
<P>
	   "This will truly be the year of the truck and SUV for Toyota," said Don
Esmond, the Toyota Division's group vice president and general manager.
</P>
<P>
	   Toyota also plans to introduce the second generation of its small RAV4 line
this year, then unveil another new SUV next January, Esmond said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sequoia, which is based on Toyota's popular Tundra pickup truck, can
seat eight and uses the same 4.7-liter V8 as the Tundra, Esmond said. The
Tundra's engine was the first Toyota truck engine to be EPA-certified as
ultra-low emission.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sequoia should go into production in October and reach showrooms two
months later, with Toyota hoping to sell 60,000 vehicles a year, Esmond said. He
said pricing has not been set but will be similar to the Expedition and
Chevrolet Tahoe, which range between about $25,000 and $28,000.
</P>
<P>
	   "What Tundra did for the full-sized pickup we think Sequoia will do for the
SUV market," Esmond said.
</P>
<P>
	   SUVs were the fastest-growing segment in 1999, up 15 percent from the
previous year, according to Morgan &AMP; Co. Last year, trucks accounted for 58
percent of the 11.6 million vehicles sold by General Motors Corp., Ford and
DaimlerChrysler AG's Chrysler division -- and probably a much larger percent of
their vehicle profits.
</P>
<P>
	   While experts say total U.S. vehicle sales in 2000 could decline slightly
from a record 16.9 million in 1999, it could be the year automakers sell more
trucks than cars, given that trucks last year amounted to 48.5 percent of sales.
</P>
<P>
	   "Is the market saturated yet? Your guess is as good as mine," GM's Gary
White said after that automaker's unveiling of its two latest entries -- the
Pontiac Aztek SUV and the Chevrolet Avalanche, a four-door pickup. "In the truck
market, the winners and losers are being defined by functionality."
</P>
<P>
	   Toyota was not the only foreign manufacturer with a truck on display.
</P>
<P>
	   Volkswagen AG pulled the wraps off a concept pickup truck, which the German
automaker says melds luxury, sportiness and the all-wheel-drive mettle to get
through most anything -- 10-cylinder, turbocharged engine and all.
</P>
<P>
	   Volkswagen also said it plans to build in 2002 a convertible version of its
New Beetle, which was reintroduced in 1998. And the company said
four-wheel-drive versions of its Passat wagons and sedans will be available
later this month.
</P>
<P>
	   Other unveilings Monday:
</P>
<P>
	   --Mercedes debuted its Vision SLA roadster, a futuristic-looking two-seater
with an arrow-shaped front end resembling an airplane wing. The four-cylinder,
125-horsepower engine is derived from the Mercedes-Benz A-Class cars sold in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   --Sweden's Volvo introduced the redesigned V70 and V70 XC station wagons,
both built on the platform of its S80 passenger car. The V70 goes on sale April
1, followed by the V70 XC on Aug. 1. The V70 XC is billed as having SUV
qualities within the framework of a station wagon.
</P>
<P>
	   --BMW introduced its new 3 Series convertible. The highlight is a box that
holds the retracted roof but can be removed when the top is up for additional
cargo space. It uses the same 2.5-liter inline V6 as other 3 Series cars,
generating 170 horsepower, and is set to go into production this spring.

<HEADLINE> Gore Announces Money To Fight AIDS  </HEADLINE>
   By NICOLE WINFIELD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- With AIDS the No. 1 killer in sub-Saharan Africa,
killing 10 times more Africans than war, Vice President Al Gore pledged Monday
to put the continent's AIDS crisis on the world's security agenda and outlined a
new U.S. effort to fight the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
	   Presiding over the first Security Council meeting to address a health issue,
Gore announced that the White House has asked Congress for $150 million for
vaccine research and prevention programs in Africa and will convene a meeting of
business leaders in Africa to start developing prevention programs in the
workplace.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We tend to think of a threat to security in terms of war and peace,'' Gore
said in the first speech by a U.S. vice president to the 15-member body. ``Yet
no one can doubt that the havoc wreaked and the toll exacted by HIV/AIDS do
threaten our security.''
</P>
<P>
	   AIDS is now the leading killer in sub-Saharan Africa, a region where poverty
and wars have already taken a heavy toll. In 1998, 200,000 people died as a
result of armed conflicts in Africa, compared to about 2.2 million from AIDS.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke scoffed at reporters' suggestions that
Gore was using his U.N. appearance to further his campaign for the Democratic
nomination for president.
</P>
<P>
	   ``None of what he's doing here today has any direct impact on the present
phase of the primary season, which is intense and being conducted in two states
which are far away from here,'' Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
	   He added that the Clinton administration has approached several members of
Congress about the request for the extra $150 million in the proposed budget and
that ``support has been quite strong.''
</P>
<P>
	   The AIDS activist group ACT-UP criticized the amount, calling it ``a drop in
the funding bucket.'' The International Association of Physicians in AIDS Care,
a Chicago-based organization of 6,800 doctors in 43 countries, agreed that $150
million was not enough but said it would help save lives ``and every life has
infinite value.''
</P>
<P>
	   Several African ministers of health addressed the open meeting, thanking
Gore for the pledge of new money and describing in detail how desperately it was
needed.
</P>
<P>
	   Namibia's health minister, Dr. Libertine Amathila, said AIDS was devastating
his country's economy, robbing families of breadwinners and children of their
parents.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is immoral that the worst affected continent has the lowest access to
care,'' she said, urging wealthy countries make drugs to treat those infected
with HIV available at prices Africans can afford.
</P>
<P>
	   She cited statistics from UNAIDS, a Geneva-based organization of
epidemiologists and statisticians who study AIDS, that show only $165 million
was spent on AIDS prevention in Africa in 1996, while estimates suggest that
between $800 million and $2.5 billion a year is needed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is worth pondering how the international community successfully
mobilized hundreds of billions of dollars over the last few years to minimize
the impact of that `other virus' -- Y2K,'' the executive director of UNAIDS, Dr.
Peter Piot, told the council.
</P>
<P>
	   An estimated 23.3 million Africans south of the Sahara currently have HIV or
AIDS, U.N. statistics show.
</P>
<P>
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan said high AIDS death rates among Africa's
elite, including public servants, threatened the ability of some countries to
govern effectively. High infection rates among police and armed forces also have
left African countries ill-equipped to face security threats, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In already unstable societies, this cocktail of disasters is a sure recipe
for more conflict,'' Annan said. ``And conflict in turn provides fertile ground
for further infections.''

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Temps May Be Rewarded  </HEADLINE>
   By TED BRIDIS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court refused Monday to free Microsoft Corp.
from having to pay as many as 10,000 temporary employees who were not allowed to
join the company's lucrative stock-purchase program.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices let stand a federal appeals court ruling that Microsoft had
said ``has far-reaching implications for the field of employment law.'' The
nation's high-tech industry has classified some employees as temporary workers
to avoid paying certain benefits and to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
	   The court action opens the way for attorneys representing these former
Microsoft employees to begin calculating how much each might be owed based on
stock they hypothetically could have purchased at a discount.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of that stock has risen nearly 2,400 percent since the original
lawsuit was filed in 1992. An attorney for the former employees, Stephen Strong,
said the case affects more than 6,000 workers -- and possibly as many as 10,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Microsoft said it now has between 5,500 and 7,000 temporary or contingent
workers in the United States, in addition to its roughly 32,000 permanent
employees.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Microsoft was a startup company that wanted to be efficient,'' Strong
said. ``Over time it grew, but it hasn't really matured in treating its normal
employees in ways they should be treated.''
</P>
<P>
	   The justices on Monday, without comment, let stand a federal appeals court
ruling that, according to Microsoft's unsuccessful appeal, ``has far-reaching
implications for the field of employment law.''
</P>
<P>
	   Microsoft spokesman Dan Leach said the company was ``disappointed the high
court has decided now is not the time to review those issues. We look forward to
putting the case behind us, and we value the contributions of everyone who makes
great software for our customers.''
</P>
<P>
	   Eight people who once worked for the Redmond, Wash., computer software
company sued in 1992, saying they and thousands more ``permatemps'' illegally
had been shut out of an employee stock purchase plan that allows employees to
buy Microsoft stock at a 15 percent discount.
</P>
<P>
	   The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals twice ruled, most recently in May,
that the temporary employees wrongly had been treated as ``independent
contractors'' or employees of employment agencies.
</P>
<P>
	   The appeals court rulings apply only in the nine Western states -- Alaska,
Arizona, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington --
in the 9th Circuit.
</P>
<P>
	   They had been entitled under Washington state law to be considered regular
employees, the appeals court said, instructing a federal trial judge to
determine what damages each of thousands of Microsoft's former temporary
employees is owed.
</P>
<P>
	   In the appeal acted on Monday, Microsoft contended the appeals court allowed
too large a ``class'' of former temporary employees to have a stake in the case.
That class could include current temporary employees and any temp who worked at
Microsoft since 1987.
</P>
<P>
	   The appeal also argued that the 9th Circuit court wrongly concluded ``that
an individual employed by an employment agency can simultaneously claim employee
benefits from both the employment agency and the agency's client for which the
individual performs services.''
</P>
<P>
	   Although the case acted on Monday centered only on Microsoft's
stock-purchase plan, temporary employees also are suing the company for health
insurance and pension benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   The case acted on today is Microsoft Corp. vs. Vizcaino, 99-498.

<HEADLINE> Chrysler Unveils New Minivans  </HEADLINE>
    By JUSTIN HYDE AP Auto Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DETROIT (AP) -- For all the $2.8 billion that DaimlerChrysler AG spent to
develop the new versions of its Chrysler and Dodge minivans, one of its most
important tools was a collection of bent Cross metal pens.
</P>
<P>
	   The pens belong to Chrysler president Jim Holden, who stuck them into the
power sliding doors on competing models to test how badly they would get
mangled. He ordered his developers to design power doors that would keep pens,
fingers and other objects from the same fate.
</P>
<P>
	   The 2001 minivans unveiled Monday reflect that attention to detail, which
Chrysler hopes will be enough to keep its old customers and win back defectors.
</P>
<P>
	   "In the Chrysler, Jeep and Dodge brands we're famous for a few things. First
and foremost it's minivans," Holden said at the North American International
Auto Show preview. "It's extremely important to us."
</P>
<P>
	   The minivans are one of the staples of Chrysler's profits, and one of the
products most beloved within the company; Holden had spent time as head of the
minivan program before becoming Chrysler president last year. It's important
enough that after the merger between Chrysler Corp. and Daimler-Benz AG in 1998,
Mercedes killed off a minivan it had been developing.
</P>
<P>
	   The basic formula for a successful minivan was set mostly by Chrysler in
1984; a front-wheel drive vehicle that drives like a car, with plenty of space.
Since then, the company has sold 8 million copies.
</P>
<P>
	   But in the 1990s, other automakers figured out the formula and had to rely
on nifty features like multiple cupholders, built-in child seats and power doors
to lure customers. Minivans also picked up an image as the driving choice for
suburban soccer moms. Sport utility vehicles offered similar room and a better
self-image for many drivers.
</P>
<P>
	   Sales growth slowed. Chrysler kept up with the trends and held onto 40
percent of the market, but saw its toughest challenges emerge last year. Power
doors turned out to be a must-have feature, and Chrysler held off while
competitors added them. New models from Honda Motor Co. and Ford Motor Co. began
to capture customers away from Chrysler's aging designs, last updated in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Honda's Odyssey was especially popular, and some dealers even had waiting
lists. Chrysler felt the blow -- its U.S. minivan sales were down 4 percent last
year, to 503,830, and the company has recently increased incentives on all
models.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's tough and there are many, many competitors," Holden said. "It puts a
bigger obligation on us to invent and innovate, and that's what we did."
</P>
<P>
	   The new models -- the Chrysler Voyager, the Dodge Caravan and the Chrysler
Town &AMP; Country -- are completely new, but look fairly similar to their
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
	   Chrysler leap-frogged into the power door battle with three per vehicle --
two on the sides and a power rear gate. When activated, the gate lets out two
seconds of warning beeps before opening. If something blocks its path opening or
closing, it stops. And it has a "finger-guard" -- a sensor running along the
seal between the door and the frame that also stops the gate if it detects an
object like a metal pen.
</P>
<P>
	   The company also touts a new design for power side doors. Chrysler engineers
wanted the doors to close smoothly under manual power, a problem they saw in
other designs. So they put the motor inside the door, and connected it to the
body with a special plastic linkage that looks like a thick bike chain running
below the door.
</P>
<P>
	   The frame was made stiffer for a more stable ride, and the engines were
reworked to improve power, with the strongest V6 now turning out 230 horsepower.
</P>
<P>
	   The interior also features a removable console that can go in the first or
second rows and contains ports for charging cell phones. Engineers also worked
to make the interior quiet enough that passengers in the third row could be
heard by the driver.
</P>
<P>
	   The new models will be priced within the current range, from about $18,000
to $37,000, and will go on sale this summer. Holden said sales this year will
slow down temporarily while the company converts its plants to building the new
models, but should rebound.

<HEADLINE> Record Nasdaq Gain; Dow Has Record  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN GLANTON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Technology and media shares led the Nasdaq composite to its
biggest point gain ever and the Dow Jones industrials to a new closing high
Monday as investors celebrated the $162 billion planned merger of America Online
and Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nasdaq composite index rose 167.05 to 4,049.67. The technology-dominated
index has risen more than 300 points in the past two sessions, wiping out most
remnants of a three-day slump that knocked 400 points off the Nasdaq last week.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow rose 49.64 to 11,572.20, topping Friday's record close of 11,522.56.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader market indicators were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose
16.13 to 1,457.60 and the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 13.58 to
501.89.
</P>
<P>
	   Technology stocks posted big gains in a wide range of sectors. Internet
service providers, biotechnology companies and businesses that build computer
networks all soared in active trading on the Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
	   But the biggest story on Wall Street was AOL, whose bold move to acquire
Time Warner spurred a wave of speculation about additional mergers between
new-line and old-line information providers.
</P>
<P>
	   Time Warner soared 25 5/16 to 90 1/16 and AOL slipped 2 to 71 3/4 on the New
York Stock Exchange after the announcement of their deal, which would be the
largest corporate merger ever.
</P>
<P>
	   AOL's quest for Time Warner, an old-line traditional media powerhouse, gave
investors added evidence that the Internet will be one of the most dominant
features in the economy of the future, traders said.
</P>
<P>
	   "This deal took great vision and courage," said Alan Ackerman, senior vice
president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. "It shows that the high valuations that many
analysts have been uncomfortable with may be justified."
</P>
<P>
	   Enthusiasm for the deal spread quickly to other Internet service providers
like Yahoo!, up 28 13/16 to 436 1/16, and Lycos, up 9 to 79 3/4.
</P>
<P>
	   Media companies also rose as analysts forecast a wave of new partnerships.
The hefty price offered for Time Warner -- a 64 percent premium to its Friday
closing price -- suggested media companies could attract lofty takeover bids.
</P>
<P>
	   Disney rose 4 3/4 to 35 7/8 and News Corp. gained 7 5/16 to 45 1/16.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts suggested the combination of AOL and Time Warner stimulated
interest in cable and wireless companies as well.
</P>
<P>
	   "A deal of this size indicates that we will start to see more
consolidation," said Robert Freedman, chief investment officer for the John
Hancock Funds in Boston. "There's a great deal of excitement surrounding these
industries."
</P>
<P>
	   Technology companies also provided the strongest boost to the Dow Monday.
Hewlett-Packard rose 7 3/16 to 111 1/16 and IBM rose 5 to 118 1/2.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past two sessions on Wall Street, technology stocks have returned to
the form that led the Nasdaq to an unprecedented 86 percent gain in 1999. Many
investors took profits from those gains last week, driving the Nasdaq 10 percent
lower over the course of three sessions.
</P>
<P>
	   Many analysts expected the Nasdaq to fall further. But investors' enthusiasm
for technology stocks, already running high, was kindled again by the AOL deal,
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
	   "These stocks had so much momentum that it's very tough to break their
cycle," said Freedman. "Shareholders appear ready and willing to buy on any
dips."
</P>
<P>
	   The industrial companies that led the Dow higher last week while technology
stocks languished again provided good news, but they had a tough time attracting
as much attention as technology and media stocks.
</P>
<P>
	   Alcoa slipped  1/4 to 84 3/8 after reporting it earned 89 cents per share in
the fourth quarter. Analysts had anticipated earnings of 76 cents per share.
Alcoa's board also voted to raise the company's dividend and split its stock
2-for-1.
</P>
<P>
	   Corporate earnings for the recently ended fourth quarter are widely expected
to show strong growth, setting a stage for further gains by U.S. stocks. Later
this week, high-profile technology companies including Yahoo! and Intel will
release their fourth-quarter figures.
</P>
<P>
	   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 4-to-3 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange. On the Nasdaq Stock Market, eight stocks rose for every five
that fell.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE composite volume totaled 1.33 billion shares, compared with 1.49
billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 0.1 percent. European market
measures rose sharply, with Germany's Xetra DAX index up 2.1 percent, Britain's
FT-SE 100 up 1.6 percent, and France's CAC-40 up 1.9 percent.

<HEADLINE> Kaye calls for private collection agencies to go after fines  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Private collection agencies will be called in to try
to get people to pay court-imposed fines and surcharges, New York's court
administrators said Monday.
<P>
	   "We're going to go ahead and try it and try to collect every penny we can,"
Chief Judge Judith Kaye said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaye also called in her annual State of the Judiciary address for the
bolstering of drug and community courts so they can handle many more misdemeanor
cases, the establishment of an inspector general to investigate whether the
appointments of fiduciaries and other lawyers are politically motivated and for
the state to continue jury reforms.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaye said officials hope private collectors will be more adept at getting
people to pay up than have court officials.
</P>
<P>
	   "Experience has shown that governmental institutions are not equipped to
function as collection agencies and are therefore not particularly successful at
this task," Kaye said.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Office of Court Administration said private agencies would be used
at first to collect fines and surcharges imposed in six court jurisdictions:
Suffolk County Court, Suffolk District Court, Nassau District Court, Queens
state Supreme Court, New York City Criminal Court and Rochester City Court.
</P>
<P>
	   Jonathan Lippman, chief state administrative judge, said those courts were
picked because of the large amounts of outstanding payments due. Kaye said that
if the private agencies are successful in those six areas, she wants the
practice to be expanded statewide.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaye proposed using the money the collection agencies raise to help pay for
an increase in the fees paid to court-appointed lawyers who defend indigent New
Yorkers. Those fees are currently $40 an hour for in-court work and $25 an hour
for out-of-court time.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaye called those fee levels "absolutely ludicrous" and "totally
unrealistic" and said too many inexperienced lawyers are handling too many such
cases because they aren't worth the time of veteran lawyers. The entire legal
system suffers because of it, Kaye said.
</P>
<P>
	   She proposed increasing the assigned counsel fees to $75 an hour for felony
and Family Court cases and to $60 an hour for non-felony cases.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaye acknowledged that low-level nonviolent misdemeanor offenders are a
problem to the police, the communities the offenders live in and to the courts.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Gov. George Pataki proposed prosecuting as a felony a fourth
misdemeanor charge against a person with three prior misdemeanor convictions. He
said some criminals had dozens of such convictions on their records for offenses
such as shoplifting, marijuana possession and disorderly conduct without ever
serving prison time.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaye advocated a different approach. She said the prosecution of misdemeanor
offenders often turns into "human recycling" because the court system doesn't
have the capacity to hold actual trials. Of the 375,000 arrest cases in the New
York City Criminal Court last year, for example, only 822 or 0.2 percent, were
resolved at trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaye said the constant plea-bargaining serves neither the defendants nor the
court system.
</P>
<P>
	   She said she will ask the Legislature to create 23 new Criminal Court
judgeships in New York City and also temporarily reassign state Supreme Court
justices to hear misdemeanor cases.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Kaye advocated changing the law so that more bench trials can
be held in misdemeanor cases and that more resources be given to drug and
community courts.
</P>
<P>
	   State Sen. James Lack, a Suffolk County Republican who chairs his chamber's
judiciary committee, said he favors putting more emphasis on drug courts and
other alternative forms of adjudicating cases to provide more room for trying
felony cases in the courts.

<HEADLINE> Tax cuts, political reform dominate ahead of Republican debate  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) - Promises of tax cuts and political reform
dominated the Republican presidential campaign Monday as the candidates staged
their third debate in five days.
<P>
	   Two weeks before the first ballots are cast in the 2000 presidential
campaign, the six-man field courted voters in a state that front-runner George
W. Bush calls his "firewall." A victory in Michigan would help him rebound if he
gets upset in earlier primary states.
</P>
<P>
	   Chief rival John McCain has made the Feb. 22 Michigan primary one of his top
four targets, along with contests in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jan. 24 Iowa caucuses open this year's election cycle.
</P>
<P>
	   Publisher Steve Forbes, activist Gary Bauer, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah and
former ambassador Alan Keyes rounded out the field for the nationally televised
debate at Calvin College in this heavily Republican western Michigan city.
</P>
<P>
	   In two debates last week, the candidates wrestled with competing tax-cutting
philosophies. Bush wants $483 billion in reductions over five years, with some
of the money returned to low- and middle-income Americans to fit his
"compassionate conservative" slogan.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who plans to flesh out his plans Tuesday, is proposing a $240
billion, five-year package that expands the lowest income tax bracket and
creates tax-free savings accounts for the middle class.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator's plan is smaller than Bush's because he would save 60
percent of future government surpluses to protect Social Security. The surplus
also would be spent on Medicare and reducing the national debt, under McCain's
plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Taking a swipe at Bush, McCain said at a Holland, Mich., town hall meeting,
"I don't think it is conservative to ignore the Social Security Trust Fund ...
the problems of Medicare or a $5.6 trillion debt."
</P>
<P>
	   Bush dismissed McCain's plan, which is a revision of a smaller package
produced by the Arizona senator in June. Using reporters to send McCain a
message, Bush said: "Is this your final tax plan?"
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes still supports a flat tax, an income tax overhaul he touted in his
failed 1996 campaign. The millionaire magazine publisher has broadened his
message to include social issues in an attempt to court conservative voters.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain is trying to change the subject from ethics to taxes, after spending
a week fielding journalists' questions about his work in the Senate on behalf of
major donors. In the town hall meeting, a voter asked McCain to explain himself
</P>
<P>
	   "I was doing my job and we're releasing all the letters I've written" to
federal agencies on behalf of political supporters, McCain said. "But, look,
this is a tough business and I understand these things happen along the way."
</P>
<P>
	   The centerpiece of McCain's campaign is a promise to clean up the political
culture.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes, meeting parents of home-schooled children before the debate, said
parents need to have more educational choices.
</P>
<P>
	   "Educational freedom and opportunity are the next great Civil Rights
battleground of the 21st century," Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bauer, a conservative activist from Washington, campaigned in New Hampshire
before the debate, saying national leaders need to prevent "a meltdown of our
values."

<HEADLINE> Fund-Raising Cases Scrutinized  </HEADLINE>
   By PETE YOST Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chief district judge in Washington directed five
prosecutions of Democratic fund-raisers to judges appointed by President
Clinton, bypassing the normal system for randomly assigning cases, records show.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton confidant Vernon Jordan interceded in one case, asking the
sentencing judge to be lenient with the defendant, prominent Miami businessman
Howard Glicken, who has been a fund-raiser for Vice President Gore. Glicken was
sentenced to community service work and probation for two misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Howard Coble, chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on courts
and intellectual property, on Monday disclosed the assignment of the cases of
Glicken and another Miami fund-raiser, Mark Jimenez, now a fugitive in the
Justice Department's campaign fund-raising probe.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, who assigned the cases, already
was under scrutiny for specially assigning cases against presidential friend
Webster Hubbell, as well as fund-raisers Charlie Trie, Maria Hsia and Pauline
Kanchanalak. The Associated Press disclosed the assignments of the Trie and
Hubbell cases last summer.
</P>
<P>
	   Coble, R-N.C., is seeking a judicial inquiry by Johnson's colleagues on the
appeals court and district court into a possible breach of the code of conduct
for federal judges.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Did Chief Judge Johnson abuse her discretion ... and should she have
allowed the normal random case-assignment process to occur?'' Coble asked in a
letter to the appeals court requesting an investigation. Johnson's
administrative assistant, Joe Alexander, had no immediate comment, nor did the
offices of U.S. District judges Henry H. Kennedy Jr. and Emmet Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson assigned the cases to Clinton appointees under the district court's
``special assignment'' policy, which allows the chief judge to bypass the normal
method of randomly assigning cases by computer.
</P>
<P>
	   Regarding an earlier complaint by the conservative group Judicial Watch,
Judge Stephen Williams of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia said the special assignment system was open to abuse. But he accepted
Johnson's explanation that she was simply trying to see that the court's
caseload was handled expeditiously when she assigned the Hubbell and Trie cases.
</P>
<P>
	   Coble asked whether Johnson made Williams aware of the Glicken and Jimenez
cases.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Was Chief Judge Johnson forthcoming with this new information'' about
Glicken and Jimenez? asked Coble. ``One must ask ... how much evidence would be
enough to justify an investigation?''
</P>
<P>
	   Four judges at the courthouse are Republicans and eight are Clinton
appointees. Johnson, the only other Democrat, is a Carter appointee.
</P>
<P>
	   Coble said Johnson ``bypassed the random case-assignment process'' in cases
that were ``potentially embarrassing to the President, the DNC, and Democrats
generally and one case involving President Clinton's close personal friend
Webster Hubbell.''
</P>
<P>
	   Days before Glicken's sentencing, Jordan wrote Kennedy, a 1997 Clinton
appointee, that ``despite his admission of wrongdoing, I am confident I can
state without hesitation that this conduct is not the type of conduct that
characterizes Howard Glicken.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mr. Glicken ... has been a member of and active participant in the
Democratic party,'' Jordan added. ``I write this letter to ask for leniency.''
</P>
<P>
	   Glicken pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors July 20 in a deal with the
Justice Department's campaign finance task force. Kennedy fined him $80,000, put
him on 18 months probation and ordered him to do 500 hours of community service.
</P>
<P>
	   A court rule permits Johnson to specially assign cases that are
``protracted.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``No rationalization can possibly justify the direct assignment of the
Glicken case,'' Coble wrote. ``There was nothing complicated or protracted about
this case. In fact, his attorney publicly announced ... the day he was charged
with soliciting a $20,000 foreign contribution ... that Mr. Glicken would plead
guilty.''
</P>
<P>
	   Jimenez, of Miami, fled the country last year after being accused of making
illegal contributions to Clinton, Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey and other
Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Two weeks after the Jimenez case was assigned to Sullivan, it was moved to
Judge Paul Friedman, who also handled the campaign finance cases of Trie,
Kanchanalak and Hsia. Friedman and Sullivan are Clinton appointees.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Why was Judge Sullivan directly assigned this case ... in the first
place?'' asked Coble. ``How is the Jimenez case related to the Trie case?''

<HEADLINE> Man Shot in U.S. Embassy in Moscow  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- A man identified as a Russian soldier was shot and wounded on
the grounds of the U.S. Embassy compound Monday after breaking in and apparently
trying to steal a car, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The report conflicted with that given by Russian police, who said two
soldiers broke into the embassy and were stopped by a Marine guard, who opened
fire, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   One of the two men was wounded, and was turned over to Russian authorities.
Interfax identified him as Yevgeny Taynakov, 23. He was operated on, but
officials at a Moscow hospital declined to comment on his condition.
</P>
<P>
	   A U.S. Embassy spokesman confirmed that an intruder had been wounded, but
refused to give details or confirm whether the incident was a shooting involving
a Marine guard.
</P>
<P>
	   The embassy statement made no mention of a second intruder. Interfax
reported that police seized a man suspected of being a second intruder near a
subway station a few hundred yards north of the embassy.
</P>
<P>
	   Both the wounded man and the suspect detained later Monday are servicemen in
an Interior Ministry paramilitary unit, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
	   The embassy spokesman said he did not know how the intruder gained access to
the heavily guarded compound located in the heart of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
	   The ITAR-Tass news agency, citing Russian police, said the intruder was
trying to steal a car and was intoxicated.
</P>
<P>
	   The intruder was spotted breaking into and trying to start up an embassy
vehicle, which he then crashed, the embassy spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said the intruder was using
the vehicle in ways that ``potentially endangered the lives and safety of
embassy personnel.''
</P>
<P>
	   Security was heavy around the embassy Monday night, with at least two
Russian police standing outside entrances that generally are guarded by one
officer.

<HEADLINE> Dartmouth Eyes Fraternity Overhaul  </HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE WEBSTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HANOVER, N.H. (AP) -- A committee at Dartmouth College -- the school whose
extracurricular debauchery inspired ``Animal House'' -- recommended Monday that
only seniors and a few juniors be allowed to live in fraternity and sorority
houses.
</P>
<P>
	   It also urged a tightening of the rules on serving alcohol at parties.
</P>
<P>
	   The committee of students, staff, trustees and alumni proposed specific
moves to meet the goal announced by school officials last year to end fraternity
and sorority life ``as we know it.''
</P>
<P>
	   That pronouncement caused an outcry at the Ivy League college, where half of
all juniors and seniors belong to single-sex ``Greek'' houses.
</P>
<P>
	   Supporters said that in snowy Hanover, the fraternity system is a major part
of the social life on the rural campus of 4,300 undergraduates.
</P>
<P>
	   But school trustees, President James Wright and some students argued the
system contributed to underage drinking, exclusivity and a lack of respect for
women and minorities. They also said Dartmouth's reputation as a party school
was leading some minority students and top-ranked applicants to choose other Ivy
League schools.
</P>
<P>
	   Now, after months of discussions, the committee has recommended a softened
plan to reduce the influence of the fraternity system, but not eliminate it
entirely.
</P>
<P>
	   Among other things, it recommended making on-campus living more attractive
by remodeling dorms and adding more social spaces to them that students would
control.
</P>
<P>
	   Dartmouth has asked students, staff and alumni to review the recommendations
and comment. The trustees are expected to begin considering a final plan in the
spring.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not as bad as I was dreading,'' said Melissa Mangan of Wilton, Conn.,
a 20-year-old junior who belongs to a sorority. She doesn't mind some of the
proposed restrictions on alcohol but said: ``I didn't want to lose my house. It
means a lot to me.''
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed rules are aimed at ending the frat-house debauchery of the type
spoofed in the 1978 comedy ``Animal House,'' co-written by Dartmouth graduate
Chris Miller.
</P>
<P>
	   The rules would allow only seniors, and juniors who are officers of a
fraternity or sorority, to live in Greek houses. Currently, students may live in
the houses starting the second semester of their sophomore year.
</P>
<P>
	   Fraternity parties would be much more carefully monitored to stop such
hallowed traditions as ``booting and rallying'' -- drinking to excess, vomiting,
and drinking some more.
</P>
<P>
	   Even privately owned frat houses would have to remove built-in bars with
taps, hire licensed alcohol servers for parties and allow campus police free
access.
</P>
<P>
	   Currently, privately owned frat houses must register their parties, but
campus police can visit only once or twice a night unless they receive
complaints.
</P>
<P>
	   Alex Hocherman, a 21-year-old senior and fraternity member, said he is glad
he will graduate before the changes take effect.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some of the reasons I initially came to Dartmouth are being undermined,''
Hocherman said. ``They're telling students, `We don't trust you to make good
social choices.'''
</P>
<P>
	   Hocherman said that under the proposed rules, drinking would simply move
into the dormitories, and some students would party off-campus, increasing the
chance of accidents from drunken driving.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Anyone who believes that because of the changes there's not going to be
any alcohol abuse or underage drinking is naive,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> City hands in proposal for arena, with or without state aid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - The city presented several versions of a plan Monday
to build a basketball and hockey arena in Newark, insisting it could build the
arena without the state's help and with only one team.
<P>
	   "It would be a very heavy burden, but it can be done," Al Faiella, the
city's deputy mayor for economic development and housing, said of the
possibility of an arena unfunded by the state and occupied only by the New
Jersey Nets.
</P>
<P>
	   The owners of the NBA team bought the Nets with the intention of moving the
team from the Meadowlands complex in East Rutherford to the state's largest
city.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey Devils owner John McMullen, however, has said he wants to take
his team from the Meadowlands to Hoboken. Gov. Christie Whitman and sports
finance experts have said that two teams would have to play at the same arena to
make it profitable.
</P>
<P>
	   Without the promise of either state or corporate aid, the city pressed
ahead, presenting its proposals for an 18,500-seat arena to the city's Central
Planning Board Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
	   The city's most ambitious plan for the arena is a $360 million proposal that
would include the arena, indoor parking garages that would hold up to 2,700 cars
and a covered walkway from Penn Station. The plan requires $70 million in state
aid, $170 million from Prudential Insurance Co. of America and city support.
</P>
<P>
	   A scaled-down, $290 million plan would have less parking, no walkway and
less commercial development around the arena, Faiella said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayor Sharpe James said an arena and the business that would accompany it
would revitalize the city.
</P>
<P>
	   "When we go to Baltimore, we go to Cleveland, Detroit, you see how those
fans enjoy those facilities," James said Monday. "When you look at jobs that
will be created, when you look at the new stores, the hotels, the retail, the
economic development, the escalation of value of property, it becomes a win-win
for the entire community."
</P>
<P>
	   But Whitman spokesman Peter McDonough said the state's decision to
contribute to the Newark arena likely will depend on whether two teams decide to
play there.
</P>
<P>
	   If the state gave money to Newark's arena with only one team in it, "they
would have to demonstrate the arena could work with one team," McDonough said.
"It's awfully hard to see how that could get done."
</P>
<P>
	   City officials say the arena can be used for rock concerts, circuses and
other large-scale entertainment.
</P>
<P>
	   Devils and Nets management didn't return telephone calls on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Prudential signed a letter of intent last summer to contribute $170 million,
raising more than half of it from other corporations. The insurer said at the
time it would prefer that two teams play in the arena.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokesman Bob DeFillippo wouldn't say whether the company would still
contribute to a one-team arena, but said Monday "the status of our commitment
hasn't changed."
</P>
<P>
	   "We believe that the project continues to be viable. It would be a very good
thing for downtown Newark," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   A public hearing on the city's arena proposals is scheduled for Feb. 7. The
city would need approval from the planning board and City Council to go ahead.

<HEADLINE> Farm Program May Add Income Aid  </HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration will propose ``significant
changes'' in federal farm programs this year to provide growers with more
assistance when crop prices are low, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have an obligation to bring some specific proposals to the table and we
will,'' Glickman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Glickman's announcement comes as Vice President Al Gore and Bill Bradley are
arguing over farm issues in Iowa, which holds presidential nominating caucuses
later this month. Gore has criticized Bradley's Senate record on farm issues,
while Bradley aides accuse Gore of presiding ``over the biggest farm recession
in a generation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Congress has approved multibillion-dollar bailouts of the farm economy in
each of the past two years following a collapse in grain prices in 1998 and
economists expect little improvement in 2000. The government predicts farmers'
crop receipts will drop about 2 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Glickman declined to discuss the recommendations under discussion, which are
expected to be part of the president's proposed 2001 budget. But the
administration has been developing a new subsidy program that would be tied to
swings in farm income and is similar to a plan proposed last year by Rep.
Charles Stenholm, D-Texas, according to congressional aides who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The devil is in the details. The difficulty has always been coming up with
something that you can reach a coalition, a consensus, about,'' Glickman said at
a news conference where he outlined his priorities for 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Last Friday, Gore announced that President Clinton's 2001 budget would
include an extra $1.3 billion for farm conservation programs, partly to help
farmers cope with the depressed commodity prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Monday, Glickman said that the government was unlikely to require the
labeling of food that contains genetically-engineered ingredients. Despite
pressure from consumer groups, the administration insists that biotech crops are
essentially the same as crops bred by conventional means.
</P>
<P>
	   President Clinton said last fall that Congress needed to ``revise, revamp
and improve'' the 1996 Freedom to Farm law because it did not take adequate care
of farmers when crop prices dropped significantly. The measure, which Clinton
signed into law, ended a Depression-era system of price supports and replaced it
with fixed annual payments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The last two years we've just thrown money at the issue,'' said Tom Buis,
a lobbyist for the National Farmers Union. ``It's time to fix the structural
problems. The safety net is one of those problems that needs to be addressed.''
</P>
<P>
	   Glickman all but ruled out proposing restrictions on what farmers can grow,
saying, ``I doubt we're going back to the old days of micromanaging
production.'' Prior to 1996, farmers had to abide by government planting
restrictions if they wanted federal subsidies.
</P>
<P>
	   Stenholm's plan would provide payments to farmers when prices fall
significantly below average. The size of the checks would be tied to local crop
yields. The idea is to guarantee farmers a minimum level of income each year and
ensure the cash goes to farmers, not landowners, as some subsidies now do.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, Larry Combest of
Texas, is holding hearings around the country in February and March on revising
the 1996 farm law and has indicated interest in Stenholm's proposal.
</P>
<P>
	   But his Senate counterpart, Richard Lugar, R-Ind., has so far resisted
considering any changes in the law. He said Monday he looked forward ``to
reviewing the details'' of the administration's proposals.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will follow prices closely again this year to determine the best course
for American agriculture within the context of the 7-year contract the federal
government made with American farmers in the 1996 farm bill,'' said Lugar.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-N.D., said Lugar would be under more pressure to
reconsider his position once the administration makes its recommendations.
``Lugar is kind of the last holdout,'' Dorgan said.

<HEADLINE> Israelis Demonstrate Vs. Syria Deal  </HEADLINE>
   By MARK LAVIE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- More than 100,000 Israelis, many waving huge maps
and banners, gathered in the drizzle Monday to demonstrate against the price
Israel would likely pay for peace with Syria -- return of the strategic Golan
Heights.
</P>
<P>
	   As Prime Minister Ehud Barak prepared to leave Shepherdstown, W.Va., after
the second round of Israel-Syria talks, leaders of the 17,000 Israelis who live
on the Golan Heights welcomed their supporters in the square in front of Tel
Aviv city hall.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will never leave the Golan Heights,'' declared Eli Malka, chairman of
the Golan Residents Committee, setting off cheers from the demonstrators.
Filling most of the square, they held banners and signs aloft with messages
including, ``The people are with the Golan'' and ``We will not leave the
Golan.''
</P>
<P>
	   The slogans appeared on stickers, hats and buttons in Hebrew and in Russian
-- an attempt to reach the tens of thousands of recent immigrants from the
former Soviet Union who could be crucial in a planned referendum on the Golan's
fate.
</P>
<P>
	   A huge 3-D map depicted the Golan and its settlements, and a two-story high
balloon declared, ``We will not descend from the Golan.''
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the protesters were teen-agers who were bused in. Before the protest
began, they sang nationalist songs.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Gen. Meir Dagan, just retired from his position as the government's
adviser on terrorism, warned that a Golan pullout would bring ''100 years of
terrorism'' into Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   In response to Barak's claim that failure to make peace would result in a
war, Dagan told the crowd, ``If we give back the Golan, there will also be a
war, and it will be bloodier and costlier than any other war in our history.''
</P>
<P>
	   Returning from the Shepherdstown talks Monday, Foreign Minister David Levy
said no progress was made.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no drawing of borders and there are no agreements,'' David Levy
told reporters. ``We can certainly not speak of results,'' he said, adding that
closing gaps between the two sides ``will have to wait for the next round.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Freishtat brought his 11-year-old son with him from Jerusalem to
demonstrate against concessions to Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are not to be trusted with a peace treaty,'' Freishtat, who moved
here 14 years ago from Silver Spring, Md., said Syria is a dictatorship and
shows no signs of change.
</P>
<P>
	   Farmer Yehoshua Weil, 52, faces eviction from the collective village of
Ramot if Israel gives up the Golan Heights. He sees the issue as more than a
matter of real estate. ``It's our home,'' he said, ``but it also appears to be a
change in the nation's values, that settlement is losing its importance.''
</P>
<P>
	   Although the turnout was impressive, organizers failed to produce what they
promised -- the largest demonstration in Israel's history -- reflecting a rift
between Golan Heights settlers and those from the West Bank. The record is
widely believed to be a demonstration against the war in Lebanon in 1982 that
drew between 300,000 and 400,000 protesters.
</P>
<P>
	   The lower-than-expected turnout might also have reflected a recent rift
between Golan Heights settlers and those from the West Bank. After joining
forces at one point, Golan settlement leaders had second thoughts. West Bank
settler leaders were not prominent at the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
	   Chaim Saperia, head of the Public Council for the Golan, said the joint
approach was a ``bad mistake.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the Golan settlers must appeal to Israel's moderates, while the West
Bank settlers are identified with hawkish ideologues. He said it was essential
to break the link to maximize support among Israelis, though the well-organized
West Bank settlers could have brought in thousands more demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak has pledged to put any agreement with Syria before the people in a
referendum.

<HEADLINE> Judge To Hear Cuba Boy Arguments  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEX VEIGA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- A Florida judge on Monday ordered 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to
remain in the United States until March, a ruling that delighted the Cuban boy's
relatives in Miami and defied a federal government order that the boy be sent
back to Cuba by Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Rosa Rodriguez issued a temporary protective order
so she can hear arguments filed by Elian's Miami relatives, who are seeking
temporary custody of him. The order requires him to remain in the area until the
March 6 hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Lazaro Gonzalez, the grand-uncle who is seeking temporary custody of Elian,
waved a copy of the ruling and yelled ``Victory for Elian!'' in Spanish before
going inside the family's home in Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Today is a great day for Elian,'' said his attorney, Spencer Eig. ''(The
ruling) will provide Elian Gonzalez his day in court.''
</P>
<P>
	   If Lazaro Gonzalez is appointed Elian's guardian, he could seek political
asylum for the boy.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found Thanksgiving Day off the coast of Fort Lauderdale, clinging
to an inner tube after his mother, stepfather and others drowned while
attempting to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   In a case that has touched off huge protests in Miami and Cuba, the
Immigration and Naturalization Service ruled last week that Elian should be
returned to his father in Cuba by Jan. 14 -- a ruling endorsed by both President
Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
	   But the judge said Monday that the petition from the boy's Miami relatives
``contains sufficient verified allegations that if emergency relief is not
granted and Elian is returned to Cuba he would be subjected to imminent and
irreparable harm, including loss of due process rights and harm to his physical
and mental health and emotional well-being.''
</P>
<P>
	   INS spokeswoman Maria Cardona said the agency would have no comment on the
ruling until its lawyers had a chance to examine it.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no immediate reaction from the Cuban government, which had already
scheduled an evening pro-Elian rally in front of the U.S. Interests Section in
Havana. The Cuban government has repeatedly urged citizens to stage mass
protests pressing for Elian's return.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, said his ex-wife did not get his
permission to take Elian out of Cuba. Gonzalez, with the backing of the Cuban
government, has demanded that his son be returned. But Elian's relatives in
Miami say they can give him a better life off the communist island.
</P>
<P>
	   The international tug-of-war over the young boy now includes several efforts
by Congress to intervene in his case. On Friday, Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., tried
to delay Elian's departure by issuing a subpoena that requires the boy to
testify before a House committee Feb. 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore has even become involved, questioning earlier Monday
whether the INS had the expertise to decide Elian's fate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'd like to see the dispute adjudicated in our courts, where traditionally
questions like what is best for this child are decided,'' Gore said in an
interview on NBC's ``Today'' show. ``This child's mother died in an effort to
get her child's freedom.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the White House on Monday, Clinton would not comment on Gore's comments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Anybody's free to express their opinion about this on whether they think
they did right or wrong,'' the president said. Like Gore, he also would not
comment on Burton's subpoena.
</P>
<P>
	   But the subpoena drew fresh criticism from Robert Edgar of the U.S. National
Council of Churches, which sent representatives to visit Elian's father in Cuba
and supports the boy's return.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Little Elian deserves to be reunited immediately with his biological
father and closest family members in Cuba,'' Edgar said. ``The longer this whole
process drags on, the more disconnected this small child becomes from those who
have raised him and who love him.''

<HEADLINE> Kohl Successor Admits Scandal Role  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) -- The man who succeeded Helmut Kohl as leader of the
Christian Democratic Union admitted Monday that he and others in the party bore
responsibility for a finance scandal swirling around the former chancellor.
</P>
<P>
	   Wolfgang Schaeuble said on ARD national television that on some occasions
during party meetings, Kohl spoke of ``financial sources.''
</P>
<P>
	   Schaeuble said he and other party leaders ``all had a part in the
responsibility for not questioning'' Kohl's remarks.
</P>
<P>
	   Schaeuble also admitted receiving $52,000 cash after a 1994 party-sponsored
affair from businessman Karlheinz Schreiber, who is fighting extradition from
Canada for suspected tax evasion in Germany.
</P>
<P>
	   Schaeuble said he turned the money over to party finance administrators and
only became aware recently that it had not been recorded as required.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In view of the current situation, one should have asked more questions,''
Schaeuble said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kohl, who led the Christian Democrats for 25 years until his election defeat
in 1998, admitted accepting up to $1 million in cash donations in the 1990s that
were kept off the party's books, apparently in violation of the law.
</P>
<P>
	   He has refused to identify the donors, saying he will not break his word to
keep their identities a secret.
</P>
<P>
	   Kohl has said the money was used to get the conservative party a foothold in
eastern Germany after unification in 1990. He denied ever using any of the money
for himself.

<HEADLINE> 54-Year-Old Woman Has Triplets  </HEADLINE>
   By LINDA ASHTON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) -- At an age when most women are going through menopause,
54-year-old Arcelia Garcia is once again dealing with diapers and night
feedings.
</P>
<P>
	   She gave birth to triplets over the weekend -- 16 years after her last child
was born.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Garcia of Sunnyside delivered three healthy girls -- Ariana, Brianna
and CeCelia -- by Caesarean section at about 5 p.m. Saturday at Yakima Valley
Memorial Hospital. The babies were conceived without fertility drugs, a rare
occurrence.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Garcia and her husband, Guillermo, 60, now have 11 children and 13
grandchildren, with two more grandchildren on the way.
</P>
<P>
	   She said she never worried that she might be too old to rear three more
little ones.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To receive a child, no woman is too old,'' Mrs. Garcia said in Spanish at
a news conference Monday. ``My love for my children that just came here is the
same as for the first one.''
</P>
<P>
	   She said learning that she would have triplets was a big, but wonderful,
surprise. Since their birth, she has seen them three times.
</P>
<P>
	   Arianna, the first born and smallest at 3 pounds, 7 ounces, is in an
incubator. Brianna, the second born, is in a crib and taking a bottle. She
weighed 5 pounds, 12.5 ounces at birth.
</P>
<P>
	   Third-in-line CeCelia, 5 pounds, 1.5 ounces, is in an incubator like her big
sister Arianna.
</P>
<P>
	   A woman in her 50s bearing triplets is extremely rare, especially without
the aid of fertility drugs. Arceli Keh of Highland, Calif., who gave birth at
63, holds the record for the world's oldest mother.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a very extraordinary case,'' said Dr. Diana Smigaj, Mrs. Garcia's
obstetrician.
</P>
<P>
	   The average age for menopause is 51, and Mrs. Garcia was showing some signs,
such as several consecutive missed periods, Smigaj said.
</P>
<P>
	   A single ``menopause baby'' isn't all that uncommon, but triplets are, she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She just hit the Lotto,'' said Mrs. Garcia's third child, Guadalupe
Garcia, 30, of Mount Vernon.
</P>
<P>
	   Seven of Mrs. Garcia's eight older children attended the news conference
with her. Her husband was at home, but he has seen pictures of the triplets,
said son Francisco Garcia, 34, of Sunnyside.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's very proud,'' Francisco Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
	   While Mrs. Garcia earlier said she planned to return to work on the family
farm soon, her children have already nixed that idea.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Maybe after six years,'' said son Miguel Garcia, 35, of Santa Rosa, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   The babies were born in the 35th week of Mrs. Garcia's pregnancy. A
full-term pregnancy lasts 40 weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Rafaela Rodriguez, 29, was present when her mom's triplets were born. She
said her first thoughts were: ``It's a miracle, for one, and I'm glad it's over
for my mom.''
</P>
<P>
	   Originally from Michoacan, Mexico, Mrs. Garcia and her family moved to
Sunnyside, a town about 30 miles southeast of Yakima, in 1976. She has been a
U.S. citizen since 1996.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Fall As Stocks Soar  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Government bond prices fell Monday as traders awaited new
reports on inflation and as stock markets rallied.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of the 30-year bond fell  1/2 point, or $5.00 cents per $1,000 in
face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.58
percent from 6.54 percent late Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bonds fell as stocks staged a broad and sharp advance on news of the planned
merger of Time Warner Inc. and America Online Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to shifting some funds into stocks, bond traders have been edgy
in advance of next month's meeting of Federal Reserve policy-makers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fed raised rates three times last year. There are expectations of
another boost in rates to cool off the economy and keep inflation under control
now that fears of a Year 2000 computer disaster have dissipated. But analysts
are divided on how much higher rates will go.
</P>
<P>
	   Investors will get a better reading on inflation later this week when the
federal government issues reports on wholesale and consumer prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Rising interest rates hurt bonds, which pay a fixed rate of return.
</P>
<P>
	   In the broader market, prices of short-term Treasury securities fell 3/32
point and intermediate maturities fell 3/16 to 9/32 point, reported Bridge
Telerate, a financial information service.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 5.39 percent as the discount rose
0.01 percentage point from Friday to 5.24 percent. Six-month yields were 5.62
percent, as the discount fell 0.01 percentage point from Friday to 5.39 percent.
One-year yields were 6.04 percent as the discount rose 0.05 percentage point to
5.70 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the discount is the
interest at which they are sold.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was
5.87 1/2 percent, up from 5.68 3/4 percent on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer said the new contract for its index
of 40 actively traded municipal bonds fell 1/32 to 91 13/16. The average yield
to maturity remained unchanged at 6.26 percent.

<HEADLINE> Hurts so bad: Buffalo Bills fans lament  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Buffalo sports fans are a beat-up bunch. Many drive
through the city with "No Goal" bumper stickers on their cars, and the phrase
"wide right" can still make a grown man cry.
<P>
	   That's why Saturday's loss to the Titans (22-16) hurts so bad: Buffalo just
can't seem to win.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's got to be a conspiracy," said John Stone, a Buffalo contractor and
sports fan. "Somebody - or something - just won't let us have it. It's an evil
force that let's us get close enough to taste a win, but then snatches it from
us."
</P>
<P>
	   Many fans here are still licking their wounds from Scott Norwood's "wide
right" that gave the New York Giants Super Bowl rings in 1991. And then there's
the Bills' Super Bowl losses of 1992, 1993 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
	   Fast forward to 1999's Stanley Cup Finals where Brett Hull's goal won the
game for Dallas, but not without controversy. Bitter Sabres fans still won't
call it a real victory: Hull's foot was in the crease.
</P>
<P>
	   Saturday just made matters worse.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was devastating," said Jacki DiPirro, president of the Nashville Bills
Backers. "To have that type of swing in emotion in 13 seconds is just
unbearable."
</P>
<P>
	   With 16 seconds left, Ms. DiPirro along with Bills fans everywhere
celebrated Steve Christie's 41-yard field goal, assuming it won the game.
</P>
<P>
	   But then it happened: Titan's tight end Frank Wycheck passed a disputed
lateral to Kevin Dyson who won the game with a 75-yard touchdown run.
</P>
<P>
	   "If it was blatantly a great play that won the game, it would be easier to
swallow," Ms. DiPirro said. "I'm tired of losing with controversial calls. I
mean, I have a 'No Goal' sticker right here on my wall in Nashville."
</P>
<P>
	   President of the Buffalo Bills Booster Club, John Opalka, has a new two-word
mantra for Buffalo fans: "What Lateral?"
</P>
<P>
	   "It hurts that human error is still a part of the game," said Opalka, who
thinks Buffalo's market size has something to do with its sports teams' bad
luck.
</P>
<P>
	   "If a bad call like Hull's no goal happened in New York City, the media and
fans there would create such controversy that it would shatter the league," he
said. "Same thing with Saturday's backward pass."
</P>
<P>
	   Erin Arrigo, a Buffalo State College student, agrees. "We're an underdog
team in an underdog market. It's sick."
</P>
<P>
	   It's logical to wonder how much more Buffalo fans can take. One area
supermarket chain put "Flutie Flakes" on sale this week, a sign that some think
fan support might wane.
</P>
<P>
	   But Buffalo's rabid fans swear that won't happen.
</P>
<P>
	   Opalka, who said the sale is nothing more than a reason to "stock up" on
Flutie Flakes, explained the Boosters are so optimistic about the Bills, they
plan to bury a Bills time capsule at the February meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   "When we open it in 25 years, the Bills will still be here and so will the
fans," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "People don't get it when you try to explain, but Buffalo teams get into
your blood," DiPirro said. "They're a part of you."

<HEADLINE> Trucks, SUVs Crowd Detroit Auto Show  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DETROIT (AP) -- The U.S. auto market may look a bit crowded with sport
utility vehicles, but Toyota believes there's still room for its new giant.
</P>
<P>
	   Muscling in on the brawny segment, the Japanese automaker on Monday
introduced the Sequoia during the North American International Auto Show as its
largest SUV, comparable in size to Ford Motor Co.'s Expedition.
</P>
<P>
	   "This will truly be the year of the truck and SUV for Toyota," said Don
Esmond, the Toyota Division's group vice president and general manager.
</P>
<P>
	   Toyota also plans to introduce the second generation of its small RAV4 line
this year, then unveil another new SUV next January, Esmond said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sequoia, which is based on Toyota's popular Tundra pickup truck, can
seat eight and uses the same 4.7-liter V8 as the Tundra, Esmond said. The
Tundra's engine was the first Toyota truck engine to be EPA-certified as
ultra-low emission.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sequoia should go into production in October and reach showrooms two
months later, with Toyota hoping to sell 60,000 vehicles a year, Esmond said. He
said pricing has not been set but will be similar to the Expedition and
Chevrolet Tahoe, which range between about $25,000 and $28,000.
</P>
<P>
	   "What Tundra did for the full-sized pickup we think Sequoia will do for the
SUV market," Esmond said.
</P>
<P>
	   SUVs were the fastest-growing segment in 1999, up 15 percent from the
previous year, according to Morgan &AMP; Co. Last year, trucks accounted for 58
percent of the 11.6 million vehicles sold by General Motors Corp., Ford and
DaimlerChrysler AG's Chrysler division -- and probably a much larger percent of
their vehicle profits.
</P>
<P>
	   While experts say total U.S. vehicle sales in 2000 could decline slightly
from a record 16.9 million in 1999, it could be the year automakers sell more
trucks than cars, given that trucks last year amounted to 48.5 percent of sales.
</P>
<P>
	   "Is the market saturated yet? Your guess is as good as mine," GM's Gary
White said after that automaker's unveiling of its two latest entries -- the
Pontiac Aztek SUV and the Chevrolet Avalanche, a four-door pickup. "In the truck
market, the winners and losers are being defined by functionality."
</P>
<P>
	   Toyota was not the only foreign manufacturer with a truck on display.
</P>
<P>
	   Volkswagen AG pulled the wraps off a concept pickup truck, which the German
automaker says melds luxury, sportiness and the all-wheel-drive mettle to get
through most anything -- 10-cylinder, turbocharged engine and all.
</P>
<P>
	   Volkswagen also said it plans to build in 2002 a convertible version of its
New Beetle, which was reintroduced in 1998. And the company said
four-wheel-drive versions of its Passat wagons and sedans will be available
later this month.
</P>
<P>
	   Other unveilings Monday:
</P>
<P>
	   --Mercedes debuted its Vision SLA roadster, a futuristic-looking two-seater
with an arrow-shaped front end resembling an airplane wing. The four-cylinder,
125-horsepower engine is derived from the Mercedes-Benz A-Class cars sold in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   --Sweden's Volvo introduced the redesigned V70 and V70 XC station wagons,
both built on the platform of its S80 passenger car. The V70 goes on sale April
1, followed by the V70 XC on Aug. 1. The V70 XC is billed as having SUV
qualities within the framework of a station wagon.
</P>
<P>
	   --BMW introduced its new 3 Series convertible. The highlight is a box that
holds the retracted roof but can be removed when the top is up for additional
cargo space. It uses the same 2.5-liter inline 6 as other 3 series cars,
generating 170 horsepower, and is set to go into production this spring.

<HEADLINE> Religious Broadcasters Irate at FCC  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A little-noticed decision by federal regulators about
when religious programming counts as educational has touched off a storm among
the nation's religious broadcasters, who complain the action amounts to an
infringement on what they can air.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Communications Commission, in deciding a license transfer last
month between a public television affiliate and a religious broadcast station in
Pittsburgh, determined that not all programming dealing with religious matters
qualifies as educational.
</P>
<P>
	   The distinction is important, because noncommercial TV broadcasters are
eligible for special educational licenses that entitle them to reserve channels
for their sole use. In its ruling, the FCC defined more clearly what standards
must be met to fall into the category of educational programming.
</P>
<P>
	   Specifically, the commission said broadcasters must devote 50 percent of
their regularly scheduled air time to educational programs. The commission also
defined what content would count as educational.
</P>
<P>
	   Programming ``primarily devoted to religious exhortation, proselytizing or
statements of personally held religious views and beliefs generally would not
qualify as `general educational' programming,'' the FCC ruled.
</P>
<P>
	   And in a footnote, it said church services also normally would not qualify
as ``general educational'' programming. The ruling made two exceptions: If the
service was part of a historic event, such as the funeral of a national leader,
or its purpose was to serve the educational or cultural needs of a community.
</P>
<P>
	   The decision has drawn fire from religious broadcasters and lawmakers, who
argue that such distinctions are arbitrary. The National Religious Broadcasters
sent a letter to 1,200 of their members decrying the ruling.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The order contains a disquieting implication that the government may
restrict certain strains of religious speech -- disfavoring more passionate and
emotional expressions of faith -- while not constraining others that are more
`intellectual' and drained of human emotion,'' wrote Brandt Gustavson, the
group's president.
</P>
<P>
	   The group knows of 15 religious broadcasters holding noncommercial licenses
but believes there could be as many as 90 who would have to meet the standards
outlined by the FCC or possibly lose their licenses. In addition, public
broadcasting stations that air religious programming, a number of which hold
noncommercial licenses, will have to scrutinize whether they meet the new FCC
criteria, said Karl Stoll, spokesman for the National Religious Broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The net effect I think will be less preaching of the gospel, less
programming of church services,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the FCC, about 373 television stations hold educational reserve
licenses nationwide. The commission estimates that about 20 of these are
religious broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
	   The bulk of religious broadcasters operate on the commercial band and are
not covered by the decision.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, the FCC action has prompted accusations by lawmakers, including
members of the House Commerce telecommunications subcommittee, that the
commission is trying to control the broadcasters' religious expression.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The commission has no business -- no business whatsoever -- singling out
religious programming for special scrutiny. The policy you have implemented
amounts to an unconstitutional restriction on religious speech. This type of
content regulation and suppression is utterly unacceptable,'' Republican Reps.
Michael Oxley of Ohio, Steve Largent of Oklahoma, Chip Pickering of Mississippi
and Cliff Stearns of Florida wrote in a letter to FCC Chairman Bill Kennard.
</P>
<P>
	   The controversy was ignited after religious broadcaster Cornerstone
Television applied for the reserve license held by a PBS affiliate in
Pittsburgh. In the course of reviewing the license swap, the commission
tightened the definition of educational programming.
</P>
<P>
	   Commissioners Harold Furchtgott-Roth and Michael Powell dissented from
issuing the new guidelines, saying that it could open a ``Pandora's Box of
problems that will create confusion and litigation.'' But two other
commissioners and Kennard said the additional guidance would help the FCC
enforce its rules.

	   Rain pelted much of the nation Monday, and snow lightly powdered several

<HEADLINE> Pataki polishes 2000-01 budget; Bruno talks reform again  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - With 5,000 criminals' DNA samples being collected
monthly, Gov. George Pataki said his state budget presentation to the
Legislature Tuesday will propose almost doubling state funds for genetic testing
and analysis.
<P>
	   Pataki said the value he places on the crime-fighting capabilities of DNA
will be reflected in the $11.8 million he will ask lawmakers to appropriate in
the new budget. That would be up from the $6.5 million the state is spending for
DNA programs in the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki is scheduled to release the 2000-01 spending plan on Tuesday. It will
be for the fiscal year beginning April 1, 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   According to the governor, the state DNA database has taken in 5,473 samples
since a new law expanding the scope of the project took effect on Dec. 1, 1999,
and officials expect about 5,000 samples to come in every month for the next
year and a half. People convicted of the most serious crimes had been required
since 1994 to submit samples, but starting in December more minor offenders were
also included under the database.
</P>
<P>
	   Inmates already in state prisons for committing certain crimes also became
subject to the DNA sampling program on Dec. 1 for the first time.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the funds for maintaining the database, the governor said he
would ask that $850,000 be distributed to the New York City Police Department,
the New York City Medical Examiner's Office, the Suffolk County Crime Lab, the
Westchester County Crime Lab and the State Police Forensic Center for
DNA-related purposes.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki said the four labs will be able to analyze evidence in 600 unsolved
cases while the NYPD will use the money to improve DNA crime scene collection
techniques.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile Monday, state Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno said he would
ask Pataki not to call any of the "three-men-in-a-room" budget meetings this
year. Those are the sessions, much criticized by reformers and many legislators,
where the governor, the Assembly speaker and the Senate majority leader sit
behind closed doors and hash out the most important aspects of new budgets and
other crucial matters.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm going to ask the governor not to call any, and the governor is the
governor and he'll do whatever he sees fit," Bruno said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki spokeswoman Zenia Mucha said it would suit the governor fine if the
Legislature took his proposed budget, worked out its own budget in conference
committees and submitted it to Pataki for his final approval.
</P>
<P>
	   "The governor has always said that he favors an open process and that they
should have conference committees," Mucha said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno, who has advocated for a more public budget process, wouldn't pledge
not to go to any of the private meetings if Pataki decided to call them,
however.
</P>
<P>
	   "I guess it would depend on the time and the place," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno also said that he would advocate conference committees on budget
reform if the Assembly passed a budget reform package. The Senate will pass its
budget reform package Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "If the speaker will pass his package and we pass our package, yes,
absolutely, it's a very valid public forum," Bruno said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki's budget proposal will be his sixth as governor and the first for
Acting Budget Director Carole Stone. She was appointed by Pataki after the
state's former budget director, Robert King, was selected late last year as the

	   During an appearance Monday near Buffalo to make an economic development
announcement, the governor tried to console Buffalo Bills' fans for their team's
heartbreaking last-second playoff loss over the weekend to Tennessee. The Bills
gave up a touchdown with three seconds to play on a kickoff in which many Bills'
fans thought Tennessee had illegally lateraled the ball forward.

	   BOSTON (AP) -- A Boston television station invited the top Republican and
Democratic presidential candidates to debate weekly until the Feb. 1 primary in
New Hampshire, but only Sen. John McCain jumped at the chance for more
prime-time exposure.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator accepted the invitation from WCVB-TV to face-off during
its regular newscasts against Texas Gov. George W. Bush. Bush's campaign
declined, saying eight all-candidate debates are on the schedule through January
and three before Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are going to be three debates in three weeks,'' said Bush
spokeswoman Karen Hughes. ``I think we're also uncomfortable with a TV station
ruling out some other candidates.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush campaign is aware that meeting one-on-one with McCain could elevate
his status as a chief rival. Some Bush supporters said privately that direct
comparisons almost always benefit the underdog, and that Bush runs a greater
risk in a one-on-one session of not comparing favorably.
</P>
<P>
	   For the Democrats, Bill Bradley's campaign said the former senator would not
accept the invitation. There was no immediate answer from Vice President Al
Gore's camp.
</P>

</P>
<P>
	   OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Saying he is ``one of us,'' Republican Gov. Frank
Keating filed papers Monday on behalf of Texas Gov. George W. Bush for the
state's presidential primaries on March 14.
</P>
<P>
	   Surrogates also filed papers on behalf of the two Democratic candidates --
Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush is considered the front-runner for the GOP contest in Oklahoma, while
polls have cast Gore as the favorite in the Democratic race.
</P>
<P>
	   The filing period for presidential candidates opened Monday and ends
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   State officials also have received filing papers, by mail, from GOP
contenders Steve Forbes, Sen. John McCain and Gary Bauer. Lance Ward, Election
Board secretary, said Forbes' filing was posted, but the filings from McCain and
Bauer were being delayed until the campaigns could fix an error on the checks
for the $5,000 filing fee.

	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidates George W. Bush
and Sen. John McCain are locked in a very close race, while Bill Bradley has an
apparent lead over Al Gore in the Democratic race, says a new poll of New
Hampshire primary voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush had 35 percent and McCain 31 percent, according to the tracking poll
done Friday though Sunday by the American Research Group of Manchester. In a
similar poll taken over the first three days of January, McCain was at 33
percent and Bush at 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In the latest tracking poll, Steve Forbes was at 15 percent. Alan Keyes,
Gary Bauer and Sen. Orrin Hatch each had between 1 and 3 percent with 12 percent
undecided.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the Democrats, Bradley had 46 percent and Gore 41 percent with 13
percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican survey included 507 likely Republican voters and 107
independents who said they plan to vote in the Republican primary. The
Democratic survey included 528 likely Democratic voters and 92
Democratic-leaning independents. In New Hampshire, independents can vote in
either party's primary.

<HEADLINE> Trial of Ex.-La. Governor Opens  </HEADLINE>
   By NATALIE GOTT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Jurors will be known by numbers, not names, when
they begin hearing evidence against Edwin Edwards, the flamboyant former
Louisiana governor who faces federal corruption charges that could land him in
jail for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards' trial opened Monday with U.S. District Judge Frank Polozola
assuring 96 potential jurors that their identities will be protected. He gave no
reasons for the secrecy, other than to say it was ``to ensure both sides will
get a fair trial.''
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors had sought juror anonymity in pre-trial hearings that were
closed to the press. Their reasons were not made public. The practice is usually
used in organized crime cases to prevent jury bribery or intimidation.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards, 72, is on trial with six others -- his son Stephen Edwards, state
Sen. Greg Tarver, state gambling board member Ecotry Fuller, and three longtime
associates: former aide Andrew Martin, businessman Bobby Johnson and cattleman
Cecil Brown.
</P>
<P>
	   They are accused of shaking down people who sought licenses to run riverboat
casinos. The scheme allegedly began during Edwards' final term in office, which
ended four years ago, and continued after he was out of office but still
considered influential.
</P>
<P>
	   A partial list of potential witnesses in the trial, released Monday,
includes Gov. Mike Foster, who was sworn in Monday to his second term after a
landslide re-election last fall; Foster's executive counsel, Cheney Joseph; and
the state's new treasurer, John Kennedy, who was revenue secretary in Foster's
first term. None of them is accused of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses will also include several former Edwards associates who made plea
bargains with federal prosecutors, the most prominent being former San Francisco
49ers owner Eddie DeBartolo.
</P>
<P>
	   And the defendants' own words -- in more than 900 hours of secretly recorded
audio tapes -- will likely be used against them. Those tapes of unguarded
conversations are replete with offensive language, including the word
``nigger.''
</P>
<P>
	   Polozola asked a roomful of potential jurors if they would be offended by
``the use of the `n' word.'' Four blacks and 13 whites raised their hands to
indicate they would.
</P>
<P>
	   Edwards, who could not discuss case details because of a strictly enforced
gag order, said as he entered the courtroom, ``We will present an effective
defense and, in the long run, all will come out well.''

<HEADLINE> Regent J. Edward Meyer retiring in March  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The state's longest-serving Regent, J. Edward Meyer,
announced Monday he will retire in March in part to help Bill Bradley become the
Democratic nominee for president.
<P>
	   "After 23 years, I'm hanging up my Regents' spikes," said Meyer, who will be
65 in April.
</P>
<P>
	   Meyer, who was first elected to the Board of Regents in 1977, said he felt
that campaigning for Bradley as a presidential delegate and working on the
Regents board would be a conflict of interest. In addition, "A lot of things I
fought for have been accomplished," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meyer listed finding current Education Commissioner Richard Mills,
developing a "meaningful" high school diploma and having a more visible Board of
Regents as some of the things he fought for.
</P>
<P>
	   Meyer said he was concerned about five years ago that Gov. George Pataki
would ask the Legislature to abolish the Board of Regents and that lawmakers
would agree.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think that is now possible," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Regents are chosen by joint sessions of the state Legislature. Because
Democrats dominate the 211 seats in the Legislature overall, that means
Democrats select and elect the Regents. Pataki, a Republican, has called for
more direct authority over the Regents and the state education commissioner.
</P>
<P>
	   The Regents are in the middle of an effort to increase the education
standards in New York. Starting this year, seniors will have to be able to pass
at least one Regents exam before getting their high school diploma.
</P>
<P>
	   "Throughout his tenure, he has advocated higher standards for students,
schools, colleges and the professions," Education Commissioner Richard Mills
said. "And he has consistently fought to provide the extra help people need to
reach those standards. We will miss his leadership."
</P>
<P>
	   Meyer said Bradley, whom he is supporting for the Democratic nomination over
Vice President Al Gore, supported him when Meyer first ran for Assembly in 1970.
</P>
<P>
	   "Bill Bradley has been my friend for 30 years," Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
	   Polls show Bradley and Gore in a tight race in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Meyer's retirement becomes official on March 31. He said he does not know
who will replace him but has suggested to legislators that they choose a
"layman," not a professional educator. "The board has to be strong and
independent, and I think a lay person could be better at that," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Meyer, who lives in Chappaqua in Westchester County, served two terms in the
Assembly and was also an assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of
New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Regents are not paid for their service on the board but they get expenses
when on official business.

<HEADLINE> Crossair Plane Crashes Near Zurich  </HEADLINE>
   By ERNST E. ABEGG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- A twin-engine airplane belonging to the Swiss
regional airline Crossair turned into a fireball and crashed into a field Monday
evening, witnesses said, killing all 10 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials couldn't immediately confirm the details of the Saab-340's crash,
which happened minutes after it left Zurich's main airport, bound for the east
German city of Dresden. But burning wreckage of the 33-seater was scattered for
nearly 300 yards at Niederhasli, just north of the runway at Zurich's Kloten
airport.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We know that seven passengers and three crew members have lost their lives
in this accident, and that is very hard to bear,'' Philippe Bruggisser, chief
executive of Crossair and Swissair parent SAirGroup, told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   The identities and nationalities of all the victims were not immediately
released. But Bruggisser said the captain, a Moldovan national, had 8,500 hours
of flying experience. The co-pilot was a Slovak and the flight attendant a
Frenchwoman, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The cause of the crash was not immediately known. Andreas Heiter of the air
traffic agency Swisscontrol said the weather was normal and there had been no
indications that anything was wrong with the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
	   Fritz Grotz, Crossair technology chief, said the airplane type had a very
good safety record. Previously there had been four crashes of the plane type
worldwide, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   With wreckage strewn around the crash site and close to houses near the
airport, a large-scale recovery operation was under way and Zurich airport was
temporarily closed after the crash.
</P>
<P>
	   The Saab-340 is widely used in the United States and elsewhere as a commuter
plane.
</P>
<P>
	   Crossair official Andre Dose said it was the first time in Crossair's
25-year history that the regional airline had lost an aircraft.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the worst accident to hit the SAirGroup since a Swissair MD11 flying
from New York to Geneva crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off Canada in September
1998, killing all 229 people aboard.

<HEADLINE> 2000 Auto Sales To Stay in Fast Lane  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DETROIT (AP) -- Automakers will sell perhaps 1 million fewer cars in the
United States in 2000 than they did in the record-setting year of 1999, but that
would be only a slight bump as the industry stays in the fast lane, company
economists said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Most of the (economic) indicators are still flashing green," said Ellen
Hughes-Cromwick, manager of Ford Motor Co.'s corporate economic group.
</P>
<P>
	   Including medium-duty and heavy trucks, automakers sold a record 17.4
million vehicles in the United States last year. According to projections by Ms.
Hughes-Cromwick and her counterparts at DaimlerChrysler AG and General Motors
Corp., that total will fall to between 16 million and 17 million in 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Factors that could cause sales to drop this year include the possibility of
higher interest rates and households shifting a bigger share of their income
into savings, the economists told a meeting of the Society of Automotive
Analysts during the North American International Auto Show on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   A trend toward stronger foreign currencies could weaken the U.S. dollar,
boosting the price of domestic-made products and making imports, particularly
those from Japan, more attractive to U.S. buyers, said G. Mustafa Mohatarem,
GM's chief economist.
</P>
<P>
	   Gasoline prices will be "considerably higher" in 2000, said Mohatarem, who
pegged U.S. sales for 2000 at between 16 million and 16.5 million. At the same
time, he said, "Cars will be more affordable in 2000 than they've been in two
decades."
</P>
<P>
	   The influence of gas prices on consumers' vehicle choices has declined since
the oil shocks of the mid 1970s, when there was a wider gap between low- and
high-mileage cars, said W. Van Bussmann, chief economist of DaimlerChrysler's
Chrysler Corp. unit.
</P>
<P>
	   Keeping sales from slipping too far below last year's record levels, they
said, will be continued productivity gains driven by technological advances, and
another year of low inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   "U.S. consumers really have enjoyed a golden age," said Bussmann, who
predicted that sales would total about 16.6 million this year.

in their republic's future.
</P>
<P>
	   Five years ago: President Clinton and Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi
Murayama held a low-key summit in Washington, playing down differences over
trade. A 9-year-old girl survived a Colombian airliner crash that killed the

</P>
<P>
	   One year ago: President Clinton and House Republicans clashed in impeachment

<HEADLINE> AP Reviews 'Dirty Blonde'  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    An AP Entertainment Review
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- It's hard putting famous people on stage without getting
bogged down in biography, but Claudia Shear, with the help of director James
Lapine, has done right by Mae West, the woman best known for doin' men wrong.
</P>
<P>
	   Shear's evocative play, "Dirty Blonde," crosscuts West's show-business saga
with a sweet little love story involving two lost souls who happen to be big
fans of the stage and film icon.
</P>
<P>
	   West was anything but sweet. She was all about sex, which, in fact, was the
title of one of her plays. By the time she was a teen, West was something of an
expert. She walked with her whole body, swung her hips and tossed her hair, and
the more the blue noses disapproved, the more she did it, according to one
description in "Dirty Blonde."
</P>
<P>
	   It was an act West kept up until she died, at age 88, in 1980. By then the
woman was a scary parody of herself, but still, people couldn't take their eyes
off her. West was, in the words of one of the play's characters, "the movie star
equivalent of Venice."
</P>
<P>
	   Shear's homage, playing off-Broadway at New York Theater Workshop, takes
shape slowly. In fact, it's a tad too languid. Some tightening would give the
evening more dramatic muscle and make its charming finale even more successful.
</P>
<P>
	   Gradually, the audience becomes aware that West's story is alternating with
the present-day tale of Charlie and Jo, two lonely people who meet at the star's
grave in New York City's borough of Queens.
</P>
<P>
	   Charlie works in film archives at the New York Public Library; Jo, a
would-be actress, moonlights as an office temp. As a teen-ager, Charlie met West
on a trip to Hollywood and became a lifetime true believer. Their initial
encounter is poignantly portrayed by Kevin Chamberlain, as the shy fan, and
Shear, who doubles as both Jo and her idol.
</P>
<P>
	   Shear's portrait of West can't quite capture the star's larger-than-life
personality -- who could? -- but the actress projects a sassiness that goes a
long way toward convincing us that West could be even more fun off-stage and
off-screen.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet "Dirty Blonde" is about more than just West or the budding relationship
between two of her most ardent admirers. It also deals with the notion of
all-consuming desire, the fierce determination by fans to learn everything they
can about their idols. As Jo says of her West fixation, "Obsession grants the
patience to really fine-tune the details."
</P>
<P>
	   Yet those details are telescoped with care and don't overwhelm the piece.
Bob Stillman, a jaunty song-and-dance man, plays all the other men in West's
life. He is particularly effective as vaudeville cohort Joe Frisco -- "I used to
play the Palace, now I just play the horses" -- who remained loyal to the end.
</P>
<P>
	   There is a wonderful moment near the end of the evening when an elderly West
has Charlie dress up as her and go outside to give a little thrill to the
tourists who pass by her Hollywood apartment. Image is all, according to West,
and when she hit upon the right formula, she never changed it. And Charlie, of
course, is thrilled.
</P>
<P>
	   Lapine's direction is astute, quickly moving from past to present and then
back again, sometimes within the space of a few minutes. Douglas Stein's simple,
almost bare, settings make that possible. "Dirty Blonde" is rich in other ways,
particularly in its depiction of a star and what it means to worship her.

<HEADLINE> Rhetoric Over Flag Heats Up  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM DAVENPORT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A South Carolina lawmaker who insulted the NAACP over
the weekend came back with another slap at the civil rights group Monday,
escalating a war of words over the Confederate flag.
</P>
<P>
	   State legislators are expected early this year to consider removing the flag
from atop the Statehouse. And the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People has imposed a tourism boycott on the state, saying the flag is
offensive.
</P>
<P>
	   State Sen. Arthur Ravenel, a Republican and former congressman, speaking to
a pro-flag rally of about 6,000 people Saturday, said lawmakers should not bow
to the ``National Association for Retarded People.''
</P>
<P>
	   Responding to reports about his comments, Ravenel on Monday said he
``apologized to the retarded folks of the world for equating them with the
NAACP.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ravenel, who has a 40-year-old son whom he describes as retarded, said he
misspoke and that while his apology to retarded people was genuine, he owed no
apology to the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
	   Lonnie Randolph, a state NAACP official, said: ``Most of us are smart enough
to know what the organization is and what the organization stands for. We don't
dignify ignorant comments and ignorant statements with a response.''
</P>
<P>
	   Recent public discussion of the flag had already grown fierce.
</P>
<P>
	   During a Friday night presidential debate here, a Republican dinner crowd
booed when George W. Bush was asked his views on the flag, and cheered when he
said it was up to the people of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   And a black state senator's attempt to juxtapose the Statehouse, the flag
and a hooded member of the Klu Klux Klan in an advertisement also upset many
state residents.
</P>
<P>
	   While many South Carolinians -- especially blacks -- consider the flag a
racist symbol, Southern heritage groups and other flag supporters say men died
for the banner and it deserves a place above the dome.
</P>
<P>
	   A poll released over the weekend said 57 percent of the 600 South
Carolinians questioned wanted the flag down, and two-thirds favored moving it to
a memorial on the Capitol grounds. The poll, commissioned by the Heritage
Roundtable of Greenville and taken by Clemson University political science
professor Dave Woodard in mid- and late December, had a margin of error of 4
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think a lot of people are dealing with flag fatigue ... and would like
to see it resolved,'' Woodard said.
</P>
<P>
	   As support grows for the flag's removal, flag advocates are likely to
ratchet up the level of rhetoric to get attention, said Bruce Ransom, also of
Clemson University.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That, perhaps, is why we have seen some of the sharp comment,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Opposition Leaders Meet  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEKSANDAR VASOVIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- For the first time in more than two years, all
major opposition parties in Serbia agreed Monday to join forces in their
struggle to topple Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement demands, among other things, that Milosevic's government end
``state terrorism.'' If honored it could mark a turning point for Serbia's
traditionally fractured pro-democracy parties in their decade-long effort to
undermine Milosevic's strong grip on power.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have agreed on a document about the strategy of the struggle against
the regime of Slobodan Milosevic, as well as the fight for early democratic
elections,'' said Vuk Draskovic, the main opposition leader.
</P>
<P>
	   The opposition deal followed a six-hour meeting of representatives of 17
political parties, organized by Draskovic and his Serbian Renewal Movement. In a
setback, however, one of those present, Momcilo Perisic, a former general and
ex-head of the Yugoslav army, refused to sign the joint document.
</P>
<P>
	   The document demands that Milosevic's government schedule early, nationwide
elections by the end of April. The opposition parties pledged to cooperate
before, during and after the elections and to hold a first joint rally in March.
</P>
<P>
	   The document also called for an end to ``state terrorism'' by Milosevic's
government and the abolishment of the repressive laws on who controls the media
and the universities.
</P>
<P>
	   In a letter to leaders of the United States, the European Union, Russia and
China, the opposition demanded an urgent end to a ban on international air
traffic and oil trade. The letter also called for remaining international
sanctions against Serbia to be lifted once Milosevic agrees to schedule
elections.
</P>
<P>
	   If the opposition parties manage to stick to the agreement, it could
considerably increase pressure on Milosevic, whose popularity has plummeted
since NATO bombing last year and the resulting loss of Kosovo province, now
administered by international military and civilian authorities.
</P>
<P>
	   Perisic said he refused to sign the document because he believed that the
opposition should try to topple Milosevic in the Yugoslav parliament first. But
all other opposition leaders said they will deepen their cooperation in the
future.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Cooperation by the opposition is an imperative, because it reflects the
struggle for survival,'' declared Vladan Batic, representative of the Alliance
for Change coalition. ``We wanted to show the regime and the world that the
opposition can unite.''
</P>
<P>
	   Since the end of the bombing, the opposition parties have tried to hammer
out a joint strategy, but the efforts, as well as a wave of street protests
against Milosevic, have failed because Draskovic refused to join in.
</P>
<P>
	   Recent opinion polls in Serbia have indicated that a united opposition would
win the elections.
</P>
<P>
	   On the eve of the opposition meeting, the state-run media unleashed a
torrent of fresh accusations against Draskovic, blasting him as traitor.
</P>
<P>
	   Rifts within Serbia's opposition parties have ruined their past chances of
success. In 1997, personal rivalries dissolved an alliance of all major
opposition groups, enabling Milosevic to consolidate his control after more than
three months of street protests shook his grip on power.

<HEADLINE> Congress Moves on Cuban Boy Case  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM RAUM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Members of Congress are moving on various fronts to block
efforts to return Elian Gonzalez to his father in Cuba. One such tactic --
subpoenaing the 6-year-old boy to testify before a House committee -- was being
reviewed Monday by government lawyers.
</P>
<P>
	   Legislative activity was building as a state court judge in Miami asserted
jurisdiction, granted the boy's Florida relatives temporary custody and ordered
a March 6 hearing on the guardianship issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Lawyers for the Justice Department and the Immigration and Naturalization
Service were evaluating the earlier congressional subpoena issued by Rep. Dan
Burton, chairman of the House Government Reform Committee, in an effort to delay
Elian's departure.
</P>
<P>
	   Also from Capitol Hill, Sen. Jesse Helms is seeking to make the boy a U.S.
citizen, while other lawmakers are weighing resident status for the father.
</P>
<P>
	   The subpoena issued late Friday requires the child to testify before his
committee Feb. 10. But Burton, R-Ind., does not expect to compel the boy to
appear, spokesman Mark Corallo said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS ruled last week that Elian, who was rescued from an inner tube in
the Atlantic Ocean on Thanksgiving Day after his mother drowned while fleeing
Cuba, should be returned to Cuba and his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, by
Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Monday's court ruling in Miami appeared to have the same effect as Burton's
subpoena -- assuring Elian would not soon go back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   Some committee members questioned whether the subpoena could be enforced,
anyway, given the boy's age and disagreement over who is his legal guardian.
</P>
<P>
	   Corallo said the subpoena was ``intended to give the courts a chance to hear
this case.'' If the boy is returned to Cuba, he said, Burton will subpoena INS
officials ``to explain to the American people why they would do such a thing.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Rep. Henry Waxman of California, the senior Democrat on the committee,
said the subpoena ``is unenforceable and shouldn't have any effect on the
proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Congressional subpoenas should be used for legitimate investigative
purposes, not political stunts,'' Waxman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Helms, R-N.C., chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, embraced
a citizenship bill originally proposed in late December by Sen. Connie Mack,
R-Fla. Colleagues, including Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., flocked
to add their names to the cause.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban President Fidel Castro ``has won a single round. He did not win the
war,'' said Sen. Robert G. Torricelli, D-N.J., one of the sponsors of the
citizenship bill.
</P>
<P>
	   In the House, GOP Rep. Benjamin Gilman of New York, chairman of the
International Relations Committee, proposed that Elian's father be granted
resident status if he can make it to the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., a sponsor of the citizenship bill said she
and other members of the Florida delegation also might support such an approach,
although she wanted to give the Florida family a chance to be heard.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Despite all the international intrigue, this all boils down to a custody
battle,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   On the campaign trail, Al Gore broke ranks with President Clinton and
Attorney General Janet Reno in questioning the INS decision.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'd like to see the dispute adjudicated in our courts, where traditionally
questions like `what is best for this child' are decided,'' the vice president
said on NBC's ``Today'' show.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he doubted that the INS had ``the experience and the expertise'' to
make a custody decision. Gore also cited a lack of compelling evidence that
Elian's father was sincere ``about what is in his child's best interest.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton, continuing to support the INS, said Monday: ``I think the INS tried
to do what was right by the child and I think that they did the best they could
with a difficult and controversial situation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about Gore's comments, Clinton said, ``Well, anybody's free to express
their opinion about this.'' The president, addressing Burton's subpoena, just
said that Burton's moves were ``always interesting.''
</P>
<P>
	   Torricelli, who supports Burton's decision to issue the subpoena, said in an
interview, ``This is a legitimate area of policy inquiry'' and not an example of
congressional meddling. The senator visited the child in Miami last month.

<HEADLINE> Carlos the Jackal Verdict Set  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- After a four-year trial, a verdict is expected next week in
the case against a man accused of participating in a deadly bombing attack on a
French cultural center, a Berlin court said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Johannes Weinrich, 52, is charged with murder, five counts of attempted
murder and planting explosives in the Aug. 23, 1983, attack that killed one
person and injured 23 others at a French cultural center in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors have sought a sentence of life in prison. A verdict is scheduled
next Monday in the case.
</P>
<P>
	   Germany's longest-sought fugitive until his 1995 arrest in Yemen, Weinrich
is a former Red Army Faction member who also headed European operations for
international terrorist Carlos the Jackal in the 1970s and '80s.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors say the Berlin bombing was one in a series of unsuccessful
attempts to pressure France to free Carlos' lover and another member of his
terrorist gang from a French prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Carlos, a Venezuelan whose real name is Ilich Ramirez Sanchez, was arrested
in Sudan in 1994. He was handed over to France for trial for a string of
killings and bombings dating from 1975.

<HEADLINE> Plan Sidesteps Agency Consolidation  </HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A government task force's plan for improving food
regulation has sidestepped the issue of whether to consolidate the dozen federal
agencies responsible for food safety, a move supported by consumer groups but
opposed by the industry.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, the President's Food Safety Council will take comment on the
consolidation issue at a public hearing Jan. 19.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The overarching goal of the plan is to improve public health by improving
the safety of the food supply,'' Catherine Woteki, the Agriculture Department's
undersecretary of food safety, said in an interview Monday. ``The council is now
asking for public comment for what organizational options would further our
ability to achieve those goals.''
</P>
<P>
	   The council's draft strategic plan, which is dated Friday, said that the
agencies responsible for various food safety issues, ``have developed different
systems for protecting the food supply, and bring different strengths and
shortcomings to the current system.''
</P>
<P>
	   The National Academy of Sciences in 1998 urged Congress to ``establish a
unified, central framework for managing food safety programs'' headed by a
single person.
</P>
<P>
	   Consumer advocacy groups criticized the council Monday for failing to
propose a consolidation plan.
</P>
<P>
	   The council, which is made up of officials from the agencies, ``seems to be
designed to fend off efforts to get a single food safety agency,'' said Caroline
Smith DeWaal of the Center for Science in the Public Interest. ``The council is
comprised of exactly the people whose ox would be gored if an independent agency
were to be formed.''
</P>
<P>
	   Carol Tucker Foreman of Consumer Federation of America also criticized the
plan for failing to propose specific goals for cutting cases of salmonella and
other pathogens.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Food Processors Association, which represents the food
industry, applauded the plan. ``What is needed is a single food safety policy,
rather than the creation of a single food agency,'' the group said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Most food safety responsibilities are handled by the Agriculture Department,
which is in charge of meat, poultry and eggs and some issues involving fresh
produce, and the Food and Drug Administration, which oversees other foods. But
agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency, Commerce Department and the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also have a role.
</P>
<P>
	   The strategic plan lays out a series of general goals in risk assessment,
management and public communication.

<HEADLINE> Pay raise plan clears Legislature, after a few bumps  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - After dodging the issue for much of the past
decade, lawmakers on Monday voted to fatten their paychecks by 40 percent in two
years and raise the salaries of the governor, judges, Cabinet officers and other
public officials.
<P>
	   Following years of balking for fear of voter wrath, Monday's pay raise
action couldn't take place without some last-minute political intrigue, however.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Senate, the vote was taken twice, with none other than Senate
President Donald DiFrancesco switching a recorded "yes" vote to an "abstain" to
clear up what his aides termed "a mistake."
</P>
<P>
	   After the second vote, the Senate total - 21 yes, 14 no, 5 not voting -
remained the same. A Democrat - Sen. Ronald Rice, switched from a "no" to a
"yes," ensuring the bill had the minimum number of votes to pass. Sen. Gary
Furnari, D-Essex, moved from "abstain" to "no," retaining the vote's symmetry.
</P>
<P>
	   "We thought maybe we'd get a double raise if we voted twice," quipped Senate
Democratic Leader Richard Codey, D-Essex.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill later passed the Assembly, 48-28, with far fewer complications.
</P>
<P>
	   It now goes to Gov. Christie Whitman, who has "not made a decision yet"
about whether to sign it, according to her spokesman, Peter McDonough.
</P>
<P>
	   If Whitman approves, the pay raises would cost taxpayers nearly $15 million
a year after being fully implemented in 2002. The bill would boost lawmaker pay
from $35,000 to $49,000, making New Jersey's part-time Legislature among the
higher paid in the nation. Lawmakers last took a pay raise vote in 1988; their
last hike took effect in 1990.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill would, in 2002, raise the governor's salary to a maximum of
$175,000, a level currently topped only by New York. Since 1990, governors have
taken only $85,000 when the maximum allowed was $130,000.
</P>
<P>
	   The state's Superior Court judges and county prosecutors would be paid
$141,000. Cabinet-level officials in the administration could also be paid
$141,000, and the chief justice of the Supreme Court would get $164,250.
</P>
<P>
	   The higher pay level was suggested by a commission lawmakers set up last
year. The pay raise effort lay dormant, however, until lawmakers suddenly
decided to push it last week.
</P>
<P>
	   The bill accepts the commission's suggestion that it regularly review public
employee pay. It does not, however, grant automatic pay raises based on the cost
of living, something some lawmakers wanted. There was no discussion on the bill
on the floor of either house Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's been 12 years since the last raise," said Sen. Joseph Kyrillos,
R-Monmouth, the upper house sponsor. "The job members of the Legislature do has
become a demanding one. And this is for all branches of the government."
</P>
<P>
	   The pay raise plan drew wrath of anti-tax advocates, including Sam Perelli,
the lone dissenter on the pay raise commission, who called the recommendations
"gifts."
</P>
<P>
	   Lawmakers, including DiFrancesco, were obviously concerned about voter
reaction. The bill gained bipartisan support in both houses, but some lawmakers
seeking future office and those considered to be in vulnerable legislative
districts didn't support the pay raises. In the two houses, 24 Democrats vote
yes, and 20 voted no. A total of 45 Republicans voted yes, while 22 voted no.
</P>
<P>
	   DiFrancesco, who wants to run for governor next year, said he intended to
sit out the vote. He told reporters he does not plan to be in the Legislature
when lawmaker pay raises take effect and didn't feel comfortable voting for a
gubernatorial pay raise.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he intended to abstain "because of the possibility it could be used
against me in the future."
</P>
<P>
	   "I just didn't want to give someone an opportunity to use it as a political
issue, and that's the honest reason," DiFrancesco said.
</P>
<P>
	   But while DiFrancesco talked with reporters, the pay vote was taken and Sen.
Joseph Palaia, standing in for DiFrancesco at the podium, mistakenly cast a yes
vote for him.
</P>
<P>
	   "The problem was, he wanted to abstain on the bill, and nobody told me,"
Palaia said.
</P>
<P>
	   A second vote was taken about a half-hour later. Rice, who wound up voting
yes, said his first vote also was a mistake.
</P>
<P>
	   "I pushed the red button when I meant to push the green button," said Rice.
"I intended to vote yes."
</P>
<P>
	   Rice acknowledged that politics played into his decision, saying being the
21st vote allowed him to lobby for several bills to help his Newark-based
district. But he said that decision was made before Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Another senator eyeing higher office, William Gormley, R-Atlantic - who is
expected to formally announce a run for U.S. Senate soon - voted no.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Assembly, however, Collins, also a potential gubernatorial candidate,
voted yes. And when Collins called the vote, he stressed: "There will be no vote
changes."

<HEADLINE> Clinton To Unveil Colombia Aid Plan  </HEADLINE>
   By GEORGE GEDDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is prepared to unveil a two-year, $1.2
billion aid program for Colombia to assist that country in its counter-narcotics
effort as well as in economic development, judicial reform and other areas.
</P>
<P>
	   A formal announcement is expected Tuesday, according to an administration
official who asked not to be identified.
</P>
<P>
	   With Colombia embroiled in a nasty civil war and serving as the principal
cocaine source in U.S. markets, the administration has made the country its No.
1 priority in Latin America. It already ranks third in overall U.S. military
assistance, and the new program is expected to raise American involvement there
to new heights. The overall aid package for the current fiscal year is about
$300 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Although details were sketchy Monday night, the bulk of the program is
expected to be geared toward assisting Colombia's counter-narcotics program,
with some funds earmarked for military forces assigned to protect anti-drug
police units.
</P>
<P>
	   Additional funds are will be used to encourage Colombian farmers to develop
crops other than coca leaf and other narcotics plants. There also will be money
for protection of human rights workers and the training of judges and
prosecutors as part of an ambitious judicial reform program. Steps also will be
taken to revitalize the country's moribund economy, now in its worst recession
in decades.
</P>
<P>
	   The new package reflects the cooperative relationship the administration has
established with President Andres Pastrana since he assumed office 17 months
ago. The administration had limited dealings with his predecessor, Ernesto
Samper, accusing him of having links to narcotraffickers.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials welcomed a controversial decision by Colombian authorities
late last year to resume the extradition of drug kingpins wanted in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
	   Pastrana came to Washington last September saying his country needed $3.5
billion in assistance over three years to supplement $4 billion in locally
generated funds to attack the country's myriad problems.
</P>
<P>
	   Limited funds were forthcoming in budget negotiations on Capitol Hill last
fall but Clinton promised a major assistance effort to in early 2000. Details of
the program, worked out by an inter-agency task force, were expected Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration is barred from assisting Colombia combat Marxist
guerrillas and instead concentrates on assisting in the counter-narcotics
effort. But the policy has led to some confusion because the guerrillas often
work hand-in-hand with the narcotraffickers.
</P>
<P>
	   Concern here over the situation in Colombia has become particularly acute
over the past year as officials realized that an extensive coca eradication
program was unable to prevent an explosion in coca production.
</P>
<P>
	   The country is not only the world's leading producer and distributor of
cocaine, it also is a major supplier of heroin and marijuana.

<HEADLINE> 54-Year-Old Woman Has Triplets  </HEADLINE>
   By LINDA ASHTON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) -- At an age when most women are going through menopause,
54-year-old Arcelia Garcia is once again dealing with diapers and night
feedings.
</P>
<P>
	   She gave birth to triplets over the weekend -- 16 years after her last child
was born.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Garcia of Sunnyside delivered three healthy girls -- Arianna, Brianna
and CeCelia -- by Caesarean section at about 5 p.m. Saturday at Yakima Valley
Memorial Hospital. The babies were conceived without fertility drugs, a rare
occurrence.
</P>
<P>
	   Mrs. Garcia and her husband, Guillermo, 60, now have 11 children and 13
grandchildren, with two more grandchildren on the way.
</P>
<P>
	   She said she never worried that she might be too old to rear three more
little ones.
</P>
<P>
	   ``To receive a child, no woman is too old,'' Mrs. Garcia said in Spanish at
a news conference Monday. ``My love for my children that just came here is the
same as for the first one.''
</P>
<P>
	   She said learning that she would have triplets was a big, but wonderful,
surprise. Since their birth, she has seen them three times.
</P>
<P>
	   Arianna, the first born and smallest at 3 pounds, 7 ounces, is in an
incubator. Brianna, the second born, is in a crib and taking a bottle. She
weighed 5 pounds, 12.5 ounces at birth.
</P>
<P>
	   Third-in-line CeCelia, 5 pounds, 1.5 ounces, is in an incubator like her big
sister Arianna.
</P>
<P>
	   A woman in her 50s bearing triplets is extremely rare, especially without
the aid of fertility drugs. Arceli Keh of Highland, Calif., who gave birth at
63, holds the record for the world's oldest mother.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a very extraordinary case,'' said Dr. Diana Smigaj, Mrs. Garcia's
obstetrician.
</P>
<P>
	   The average age for menopause is 51, and Mrs. Garcia was showing some signs,
such as several consecutive missed periods, Smigaj said.
</P>
<P>
	   A single ``menopause baby'' isn't all that uncommon, but triplets are, she
said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She just hit the Lotto,'' said Mrs. Garcia's third child, Guadalupe
Garcia, 30, of Mount Vernon.
</P>
<P>
	   Seven of Mrs. Garcia's eight older children attended the news conference
with her. Her husband was at home, but he has seen pictures of the triplets,
said son Francisco Garcia, 34, of Sunnyside.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's very proud,'' Francisco Garcia said.
</P>
<P>
	   While Mrs. Garcia earlier said she planned to return to work on the family
farm soon, her children have already nixed that idea.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Maybe after six years,'' said son Miguel Garcia, 35, of Santa Rosa, Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   The babies were born in the 35th week of Mrs. Garcia's pregnancy. A
full-term pregnancy lasts 40 weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Rafaela Rodriguez, 29, was present when her mom's triplets were born. She
said her first thoughts were: ``It's a miracle, for one, and I'm glad it's over
for my mom.''
</P>
<P>
	   Originally from Michoacan, Mexico, Mrs. Garcia and her family moved to
Sunnyside, a town about 30 miles southeast of Yakima, in 1976. She has been a
U.S. citizen since 1996.

<HEADLINE> Bush Denounces Forbes Ad  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- Gov. George Bush described himself Monday night
as ``a tax cutting person'' who knows how to get it done, disputing and
denouncing a campaign ad in which presidential rival Steve Forbes accuses him of
breaking a pledge against tax increases in Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. John McCain chimed in, saying that the federal tax cut Bush is
proposing now would spend all the projected budget surplus and $20 billion more,
with benefits going to people who don't need them. He also said the Bush plan
would not guarantee funds to guard future Social Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   The tax hassle was the keynote dispute as the six Republican presidential
candidates met in a 90-minute televised debate.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said he has twice led his state to the biggest tax cuts in its history.
His packages included off-setting increases in sales taxes, but Bush said the
result was lower levies on Texans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am a tax cutting person,'' Bush said. ``I know how to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
	   As president, he said, he would see to it that rates are cut for every
American.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes wasn't budging, saying he stood by his ad. ``A pledge should not be
used as a trinket to win an election,'' he said. ``The ad is accurate. ... You
did break that pledge.'' He said things like that make Americans cynical about
politics.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush shot back, ``One thing that makes the American people cynical is
negative advertisements on TV.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Forbes ad points to a 1994 vow Bush made while running for governor,
signing a pledge to an anti-tax group that he would ``oppose any legislation
establishing a state personal income tax or increasing the sales tax.'' Critics
say Bush in 1997 did propose some tax increases to the Texas legislature to help
fund a $3 billion property tax rollback.

	   BOSTON (AP) -- A Boston television station invited the top Republican and
Democratic presidential candidates to debate weekly until the Feb. 1 primary in
New Hampshire, but only Sen. John McCain jumped at the chance for more
prime-time exposure.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator accepted the invitation from WCVB-TV to face-off during
its regular newscasts against Texas Gov. George W. Bush. Bush's campaign
declined, saying eight all-candidate debates are on the schedule through January
and three before Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are going to be three debates in three weeks,'' said Bush
spokeswoman Karen Hughes. ``I think we're also uncomfortable with a TV station
ruling out some other candidates.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Bush campaign is aware that meeting one-on-one with McCain could elevate
his status as a chief rival. Some Bush supporters said privately that direct
comparisons almost always benefit the underdog, and that Bush runs a greater
risk in a one-on-one session of not comparing favorably.
</P>
<P>
	   For the Democrats, Bill Bradley's campaign said the former senator would not
accept the invitation. There was no immediate answer from Vice President Al
Gore's camp.
</P>

</P>
<P>
	   OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Saying he is ``one of us,'' Republican Gov. Frank
Keating filed papers Monday on behalf of Texas Gov. George W. Bush for the
state's presidential primaries on March 14.
</P>
<P>
	   Surrogates also filed papers on behalf of the two Democratic candidates --
Vice President Al Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush is considered the front-runner for the GOP contest in Oklahoma, while
polls have cast Gore as the favorite in the Democratic race.
</P>
<P>
	   The filing period for presidential candidates opened Monday and ends
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   State officials also have received filing papers, by mail, from GOP
contenders Steve Forbes, Sen. John McCain and Gary Bauer. Lance Ward, Election
Board secretary, said Forbes' filing was posted, but the filings from McCain and
Bauer were being delayed until the campaigns could fix an error on the checks
for the $5,000 filing fee.

	   MANCHESTER, N.H. (AP) -- Republican presidential candidates George W. Bush
and Sen. John McCain are locked in a very close race, while Bill Bradley has an
apparent lead over Al Gore in the Democratic race, says a new poll of New
Hampshire primary voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush had 35 percent and McCain 31 percent, according to the tracking poll
done Friday though Sunday by the American Research Group of Manchester. In a
similar poll taken over the first three days of January, McCain was at 33
percent and Bush at 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In the latest tracking poll, Steve Forbes was at 15 percent. Alan Keyes,
Gary Bauer and Sen. Orrin Hatch each had between 1 and 3 percent with 12 percent
undecided.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the Democrats, Bradley had 46 percent and Gore 41 percent with 13
percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
	   The poll's margin of error was plus or minus 4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   The Republican survey included 507 likely Republican voters and 107
independents who said they plan to vote in the Republican primary. The
Democratic survey included 528 likely Democratic voters and 92
Democratic-leaning independents. In New Hampshire, independents can vote in
either party's primary.

	   PORTSMOUTH, N.H. (AP) -- The government should deliver on some of its past
promises to farmers, Texas Gov. George W. Bush told a farm group Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking by satellite to the American Farm Bureau convention in Houston,
Bush said the government generally has not fulfilled promises to reduce
regulation of farmers and invest in new agricultural technology.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In most cases, you are still waiting,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   He also repeated his call for eliminating federal death taxes, which can
prevent farms from being passed on to children, and using ``fast-track'' trade
negotiations to open foreign markets to U.S. farmers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's a powerful tool in prying open foreign markets,'' Bush said of the
fast-track approach. ``It never has been more necessary.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush also proposed special tax-deferred savings accounts, similar to
Individual Retirement Accounts, for farmers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Down the road, these farm accounts will help in rough years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush also vowed that, as president, he would fight to tear down trade
barriers by foreign governments and the United States, saying that ``we are too
good a people to use food as a diplomatic weapon.''

<HEADLINE> Uncrowded Crowd Greets Bush in Mich  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- If you wanted to meet George W. Bush, this was
your chance.
</P>
<P>
	   Fewer than 150 people turned out Monday afternoon to greet the Republican
presidential front-runner as he arrived for a debate at Calvin College.
</P>
<P>
	   But he still got a loud cheer when he entered the hangar at the Gerald R.
Ford International Airport to the sounds of Van Morrison's ``Bright Side of the
Road.''
</P>
<P>
	   Nearly everyone got to shake the Texas governor's hand, get an autograph or
get a picture taken with him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think Bush is on the right track and he's got a tax break I like, and
he's sincere,'' said Tony Senagor, 74, of Grand Rapids, who described himself as
a straight-ticket Republican. ``I think he's going to be moderate.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   The small turnout for Bush was in sharp contrast to an event several months
ago at the same airport hangar for GOP presidential rival Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator was at the airport to officially kick off his
presidential campaign. About 250 people turned out. Most said they liked McCain
but were unsure about backing an underdog.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has been running ads in Michigan and gaining in strength since the
opening.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Michigan Democratic Chairman Mark Brewer came armed with jelly donuts Monday
as he attacked Bush for having a poor record on health care in Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We think George Bush's ideas are a lot like this donut,'' Brewer said,
holding one up during a pre-debate news conference in Grand Rapids.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It may look good, it may sound appetizing, but in fact it's bad for you.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said McCain's policies were equally poor.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Most of the 175 Calvin College students attending the debate were lucky
enough to win a ticket, but only a handful earned their seats.
</P>
<P>
	   The college held a contest for questions to ask the candidates in the
debate's third round. About 70 questions were submitted, and nine were chosen,
ranging from the effects of negative campaigning to the cost of tuition to
censorship on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   Dave Dykhouse, a sophomore business major, wanted to know how the
candidates' religion would influence them if elected.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was interesting to hear them talk about religion in New Hampshire,'' he
said. ``I want to hear more of that.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   It was easy for Brewer, the state Democratic chairman, to pick the winner of
Monday's debate: Michigan GOP Chairwoman Betsy DeVos, who arranged it without
first checking with Gov. John Engler, a staunch Bush backer.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush at first said he wouldn't participate, then changed his mind. Monday's
debate was the third in four days for the six-man GOP field.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This (debate) was done by Betsy DeVos to embarrass Engler, and so far she
seems to have the upper hand,'' Brewer said.
</P>
<P>
	   DeVos said a no-show by Bush could have hurt him. ``That's a possibility,''
she said, adding she was neutral in the race.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Calvin College students hoped the debate would put their Christian liberal
arts college on the map -- literally.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Not a lot of people outside the Midwest have heard of Calvin College,
unless they are Christian Reform,'' said junior Jeremy Johnson of Lakewood,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When I tell people I go to Calvin, they say, 'Oh, where's that?''' said
Melissa Keeley, a political science freshman from Midland Park, N.J.
``Especially since this is a political debate, maybe it will open the door for
internships in (Washington) D.C.''

<HEADLINE> Judge To Hear Cuba Boy Arguments  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEX VEIGA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- A Florida judge on Monday ordered 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to
remain in the United States until March, a ruling that delighted the Cuban boy's
relatives in Miami and defied a federal government order that he be sent back to
Cuba by Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Rosa Rodriguez issued a temporary protective order
so she can hear arguments filed by Elian's Miami relatives, who are seeking
temporary custody of him. The order requires Elian to remain in the area until
the March 6 hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Waving a copy of the ruling, Lazaro Gonzalez, the great-uncle who is seeking
temporary custody of Elian, yelled ``Victory for Elian!'' in Spanish before
going inside the family's home in Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Today is a great day for Elian,'' said his attorney, Spencer Eig. ''(The
ruling) will provide Elian Gonzalez his day in court.''
</P>
<P>
	   If Lazaro Gonzalez is appointed Elian's guardian, he could seek political
asylum for the boy.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found Thanksgiving Day off the coast of Fort Lauderdale, clinging
to an inner tube after his mother, stepfather and others drowned while
attempting to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   In a case that has touched off huge protests in Miami and Cuba, the
Immigration and Naturalization Service ruled last week that Elian should be
returned to his father in Cuba by Friday -- a ruling endorsed by President
Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS said it found that the boy had a close relationship with his father
and was ordering Elian back to Cuba because he ``belongs with his father.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the judge said Monday that the petition from the boy's Miami relatives
``contains sufficient verified allegations that if emergency relief is not
granted and Elian is returned to Cuba he would be subjected to imminent and
irreparable harm, including loss of due process rights and harm to his physical
and mental health and emotional well-being.''
</P>
<P>
	   INS spokeswoman Maria Cardona said the agency had no comment until its
lawyers had a chance to examine the ruling. Another INS spokesman, Mike Gilhooly
said: ``The INS has no plans to do any enforcement action on Elian. We have no
plans to change the custody arrangement of him being with his Miami family.'' He
did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   Bernard Perlmutter, director of the University of Miami's Children and Youth
Law Clinic, said the judge's decision was ``politically popular,'' but legally
wrong. He said the INS can ignore Rodriguez's decision and return the boy to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   There was no reaction from the Cuban government, which had already scheduled
an evening pro-Elian rally in front of the U.S. Interests Section in Havana. The
Cuban government has repeatedly urged citizens to stage mass protests pressing
for Elian's return.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, said his ex-wife did not get his
permission to take Elian out of Cuba. Gonzalez, with the backing of the Cuban
government, has demanded that his son be returned. But Elian's relatives in
Miami say they can give him a better life off the communist island.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of the judge's ruling, Gonzalez was ordered to appear at the March
hearing. Her order said that his ``failure to appear may result in a decision
adverse to his interests.'' Gonzalez has said that he would not travel to the
United States to retrieve his son.
</P>
<P>
	   The international tug-of-war over the young boy now includes several efforts
by Congress to intervene in his case. On Friday, Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., tried
to delay Elian's departure by issuing a subpoena that requires the boy to
testify before a House committee Feb. 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore has even become involved, questioning earlier Monday
whether the INS had the expertise to decide Elian's fate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'd like to see the dispute adjudicated in our courts, where traditionally
questions like what is best for this child are decided,'' Gore said in an
interview on NBC's ``Today'' show. ``This child's mother died in an effort to
get her child's freedom.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the White House on Monday, Clinton would not comment on Gore's comments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Anybody's free to express their opinion about this on whether they think
they did right or wrong,'' the president said. Like Gore, he also would not
comment on Burton's subpoena.
</P>
<P>
	   But the subpoena drew fresh criticism from Robert Edgar of the U.S. National
Council of Churches, which sent representatives to visit Elian's father in Cuba
and supports the boy's return.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Little Elian deserves to be reunited immediately with his biological
father and closest family members in Cuba,'' Edgar said. ``The longer this whole
process drags on, the more disconnected this small child becomes from those who
have raised him and who love him.''

<HEADLINE> More Disease Control Funding Sought  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration said Monday it will propose a
nearly 50 percent increase in the amount the federal government spends on a
planned national monitoring and control plan to combat infectious disease.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed increase, part of President Clinton's budget for fiscal 2001,
would add $20 million to the federal effort to identify and stem outbreaks of
disease such as influenza, Lyme disease and hantavirus.
</P>
<P>
	   The money would help underwrite a planned new electronic disease
surveillance network. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
already is spending $44 million annually on the project.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This new network will develop a two-way information highway that will
ensure the timely transmission of information from physicians and health
facilities on the front lines to state health departments and the CDC,'' and
thus speed the response to outbreaks, a White House statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   If approved by Congress this year, the increased funding also would help
support public-private partnerships ``to ensure that commercial labs implement
and electronic reporting system compatible,'' with the federal one already under
development, the White House said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton will submit his budget package to Congress next month. The White
House has discussed some details of the package in recent weeks, to draw
attention to initiatives the administration will highlight this year, and test
public reaction to others.
</P>
<P>
	   Between 1973 and 1999, more than 35 new or newly discovered infectious
diseases emerged, including AIDS and toxic shock syndrome.
</P>
<P>
	   The outbreak of a deadly virus similar to an African strain along the East
Coast last year and a recent flu pandemic in Hong Kong ``underscore the ongoing
threat that infectious diseases pose to our health and the increasing impact
they have on health care costs,'' the White House statement said.
</P>
<P>
	   About one of every six health care dollars spent in the United States goes
to fight infectious diseases, and infectious complications in hospitals add
about $20 billion to the national health care bill annually, the White House
said. Such diseases account for about one-quarter of all doctor visits,
according to federal estimates.

<HEADLINE> Union Health Funds Lose Vs. Tobacco  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The tobacco industry won a significant legal victory
Monday when the Supreme Court refused to let union health funds sue cigarette
makers to recover the cost of treating smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
	   The justices rejected appeals in which union health funds from Pennsylvania,
Oregon and New York argued they should be allowed to sue tobacco companies under
federal racketeering and antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're gratified,'' said Herbert Wachtel, a lawyer for Phillip Morris Inc.
``Four courts of appeals have held unanimously that these third-party cases are
without merit. Hopefully, this will put an end to them.''
</P>
<P>
	   Although Monday's action set no national precedent, the three unsuccessful
appeals had been viewed as health funds' best chance to reverse rulings that
have thwarted their lawsuits against cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
	   John Banzhaf of Action on Smoking and Health lamented the court's action.
``The tobacco industry gets to keep its ill-gotten gain and the public health
loses,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Banzhaf said the court's denial of review ``sounds the death knell for these
types of lawsuits by health funds and possibly by other third parties as well.''
</P>
<P>
	   Federal appeals courts also have disallowed smoking-related lawsuits by Blue
Cross, foreign countries and smokers' employers.
</P>
<P>
	   But a federal trial judge in the District of Columbia has allowed a union
health fund's lawsuit against cigarette makers. Matthew Myers, president of
Campaign For Tobacco Free Kids, noted that the Supreme Court's action ``does not
remove that important case from the docket.''
</P>
<P>
	   The health funds' lawsuits accused the tobacco industry of defrauding them
into paying to treat illnesses caused by health-plan participants' smoking.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuits contended cigarette makers and related industry organizations
withheld accurate information about smoking's health effects that might have led
the funds to more aggressively discourage their members from smoking.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawsuits were patterned after similar state claims that led to
settlements in which the tobacco industry will pay the states $246 billion for
health care costs. The Justice Department also sued the industry; its pending
lawsuit was not directly affected by Monday's action.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The health fund lawsuits never have been a central component of the
tobacco-prevention effort,'' Myers said.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal appeals courts ruled unanimously that the union health funds could
not sue because they were seeking payment for damages suffered by their members,
who could sue on their own.
</P>
<P>
	   In dismissing the lawsuit by seven Pennsylvania union health funds, the 3rd
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the states could sue because they were
authorized to do so under state law, or because of the ``political power of
governmental bodies'' -- authority and power union health funds do not have.
</P>
<P>
	   In their Supreme Court appeals, the health funds' operators argued their
members cannot sue under the federal laws they tried to invoke -- laws that
provide for tripled damages.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a clear national interest in holding tobacco companies
accountable for the public health devastation they have wreaked,'' one of the
appeals said.
</P>
<P>
	   Banzhaf said tobacco companies are being given future immunity from such
lawsuits. ``Even if the tobacco industry's conduct costs health plans billions
of dollars in the future, they're not going to be able to collect a dime,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   He suggested that all such funds protect themselves by charging higher
premiums for smokers.
</P>
<P>
	   Tobacco stocks were mostly up on the news. Shares of Philip Morris were up
31 1/4 cents to $24, R.J. Reynolds rose 37 1/2 cents, to $19.81 1/4 and Loews
Corp., parent of Lorillard, was down 31 1/4 cents to $58.68 1/4 at 5:15 p.m.
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Co. Reports Progress in DNA Mapping  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Maryland company announced Monday it has sequenced DNA
that accounts for 90 percent of the human genetic pattern, another step as
private laboratories and government scientists race to map all the human genes.
</P>
<P>
	   The new data is "a rough draft," said Celera Genomics president J. Craig
Venter, acknowledging genes in the Rockville, Md., database have not yet been
assembled to know how and where they fit into the genetic blueprint.
</P>
<P>
	   But, "we've discovered literally thousands and thousands of new genes that
are clearly going to be of importance to the pharmaceutical industry, enabling
them to hopefully move therapeutic advancement forward at a much faster pace,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Celera sells its gene information mostly to pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
	   Previously, government-supported scientists had announced sequencing
one-third of the human genome, on track to complete a working draft of the
entire genetic map by spring.
</P>
<P>
	   Venter said Celera did use the government's public gene database to add to
its own gene discoveries and come up with the 90 percent total. Celera's gene
database, however, is not available for government scientists to reciprocate.
</P>
<P>
	   The human genome is a biological map laying out the exact sequence of the
estimated 3.5 billion pairs of chemicals that make up the DNA in each human
cell. Those chemicals are arranged in specific ways to create the estimated
80,000 to 100,000 human genes, which in turn carry the instructions for all the
body's processes.
</P>
<P>
	   Think of it as a huge jigsaw puzzle. Celera uses what it calls a "shotgun
technique" to identify snippets of DNA, quickly accumulating lots of genetic
puzzle pieces that scientists then must go back and fit together.
</P>
<P>
	   In contrast, the government-sponsored Human Genome Project fits the genetic
puzzle pieces together as they are discovered, accumulating larger, more
accurate pieces, said Kathy Hudson of the National Center for Human Genome
Research.
</P>
<P>
	   Celera's stock rose $55.06 1/4, more than 29 percent, to $242 at 5:15 p.m.
on the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Infertile couples to get medical coverage under new bill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Infertile couples, coping with the emotional and
physical toll of trying to conceive, may have one less thing to worry about:
medical bills.
<P>
	   A measure that passed the state Assembly Monday would require some health
insurance policies to cover infertility treatments.
</P>
<P>
	   Treatments can cost thousands of dollars. Some couples, desperate to have
children, dig into savings accounts, take out loans and borrow from family and
friends, said Susan Slotnick, vice president of Resolve of New Jersey, a
statewide support and information group for people struggling with infertility.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have members who have mortgaged their homes, who have run up their
credit cards, borrowed money from their parents," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   "The costs are prohibitive for the majority of our membership. How can you
tell somebody who can afford the technology, 'OK, you can have a family,'
whereas those who don't have the resources are not entitled to have a family.
That's what we feel this bill remedies - the difference between the haves and
have-nots."
</P>
<P>
	   The bill passed the state Assembly with 45 members voting for it, 11 against
and 15 abstaining. It passed the Senate in December and now heads to Gov.
Christie Whitman's desk for consideration.
</P>
<P>
	   It's uncertain whether Whitman will sign it.
</P>
<P>
	   "Some early indications are that the legislation would be a costly mandated
benefit," said Jayne O'Connor, Whitman spokeswoman. "But the governor has not
taken a position on it. We'll review it."
</P>
<P>
	   The bill requires employers and other groups with 50 or more members to
cover infertility treatments if the medical insurance they offer includes
pregnancy-related benefits. An estimated 535,000 New Jerseyans are infertile,
Slotnick said.
</P>
<P>
	   The measure targets a wide range of treatments, including expensive in vitro
fertilization in which an egg is fertilized outside the uterus and then
implanted. But insurers can require patients to try less expansive treatments
before being eligible for the costly high-tech procedures.
</P>
<P>
	   The measure stipulates that a woman under 35 would have to try to conceive
for two years before being considered infertile and eligible for benefits. Women
over 35 would have to fail to conceive for one year before being eligible.
</P>
<P>
	   Thirteen states already require some type of coverage, according to Diane
Aronson, executive director of Resolve, the National Infertility Association,
located in Massachusetts, one of the states that requires coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   The requirement would increase the cost of health insurance, pushing it even
farther out of reach of the 1.3 million New Jerseyans who don't have insurance
now, said Paul Langevin, president of the New Jersey Association of Health
Plans.
</P>
<P>
	   He said many insurance companies already cover infertility treatments and
employers can add that coverage, if they choose.
</P>
<P>
	   But Sen. Robert Martin, R-Morris, a bill sponsor, said the cost increase
would be slight.
</P>
<P>
	   "When we looked at data from other states, when the costs are spread over a
large pool of risk, it really isn't very expensive," he said. State workers
already have infertility coverage, he pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Still Struggling in Iowa  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa (AP) -- On some hilly stretches of the road from
Indianola to Osceola to Creston, Bill Bradley's bus caravan creeps at 15 mph --
much like the candidate's uphill struggle to pull off a ``January surprise'' in
Iowa.
</P>
<P>
	   Two weeks before voting in the caucuses, Bradley holds out hope for a strong
showing although he has gained little traction in this farm state and remains 20
points behind Democratic presidential rival Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Remember Harry Truman and how they said to him, 'You're never gonna win;
you're never gonna beat that guy Dewey,''' Bradley declares. He says he'll be
happy with 30 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley spent his first days of the new year here preoccupied with damage
control on agriculture and education policy, areas where Vice President Gore has
accused him of neglect.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My mother was a school teacher, my aunt was a school teacher,'' Bradley
told students at Atlantic High School on Monday. He outlined proposals for
after-school programs and for recruiting 60,000 new teachers.
</P>
<P>
	   A day earlier, Bradley was consumed with defending his Senate record on farm
policy against a pointed offensive by Gore. And Gore's supporters were back on
the attack Monday, with Sen. Tom Harkin saying, ``Yes the farm economy is bad,
but matters would be a lot worse if Bill Bradley had had his way when farmers
really needed his vote.''
</P>
<P>
	   Since the vice president has a lock on the party activists who traditionally
dominate Iowa's caucuses, Bradley's challenge is to coax first-timers to the
Jan. 24 caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Crowds for the former senator and basketball star can border on starstruck,
but they also are thin, offering little hope for a big turnout on caucus night.
Where the vice president draws about 500 to high schools and 4-H centers,
Bradley, with his wife, draws closer to half that.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Bradley told could-be supporters at the Crouse Cafe in Indianola,
``On election night, when the caucuses are counted, I want to surprise a lot of
people.''
</P>
<P>
	   He personally keeps count of the pledges voters sign at each stop -- 47 at
the cafe, he reported -- and likes to recall that no insurgent has done better
in the Iowa caucuses than the 31 percent Sen. Edward Kennedy took from winner
Jimmy Carter in 1980.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday alone, Bradley had 15 pages of ``call sheets'' to work through,
telephoning potential caucus goers.
</P>
<P>
	   There is encouragement in the response of such Iowans as retired airline
employee Dottie Lewis of Creston, who said Bradley's flood of straight-talking
TV ads persuaded her to plan to attend a caucus for the first time. ``I've never
been as interested in a candidate before,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Defending his Senate voting record on farm issues is hardly what Bradley
hoped to be doing in January. ``When you're 20 points down it doesn't help,''
said Drake University political science professor Dennis Goldford. But Goldford
suggested the damage may be limited.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know how much of Bradley's support comes from the farm side,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley hoped to go on the offensive Tuesday with a Des Moint event designed
to cast doubt on Gore's anti-tobacco record.
</P>
<P>
	   The intensity of Bradley's effort hasn't turned him into a 24-hour grump.
</P>
<P>
	   Sitting on the bus with a diet A&AMP;W vanilla soda propped between his legs,
Bradley said he was tickled the other night when a couple of gals at the
American Legion, where he drank beer straight from the pitcher, coaxed him into
a ``tag dance.'' He was disappointed not to find a karaoke bar in downtown Des
Moines.
</P>
<P>
	   The often-private Bradley also gabbed about his mental health -- no
depression or other mental illness, ``I can certainly tell you that'' -- and his
favorite recent movie -- ``The Green Mile.'' Both those questions were ruled
off-limits when reporters raised them last year.
</P>
<P>
	   An animated storyteller, Bradley spices his stump speech with dramatizations
of a Russian basketball player's elbow jabs.
</P>
<P>
	   But the elbows from Gore on his record and promises put an angry edge into
Bradley's voice.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore ``doesn't have a leg to stand on'' when it comes to farm policy, he
tells reporters. If he sounds negative -- a no-no among voters, according to
surveys -- he says Gore and his camp started it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I didn't open that door, but they did,'' Bradley said. ``I'm certainly not
going to lighten up.''
</P>
<P>
	   By caucus date, Bradley will have spent $1.4 million on television
advertising here, a sum that his campaign manager Gina Glantz said was
equivalent to Gore's Iowa ad expenses.
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore camp, trying to worsen the perception of Bradley's showing,
whatever vote percentage he gets, calls the ad spending evidence Bradley is out
to win.
</P>
<P>
	   This two-day bus swing through Iowa's heavily Republican southwest is
Bradley's 31st trip to the state as a presidential candidate. And yet, by way of
explaining his persistent double-digit deficit to Gore in polls, Bradley says
Iowans still don't know him. A poll last week said 13 percent of registered Iowa
voters were unsure or uncommitted.
</P>
<P>
	   It doesn't help, Bradley said, that Gore has the forces of the Democratic
Party gathered behind him.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked Sunday about a report that Democratic National Committee officials
were faulting Bradley for not helping the party raise money, as Gore has,
Bradley suggested he doesn't owe the party establishment anything right now.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I feel that the DNC has to be supportive of both candidates. And I think
that early on in this process that wasn't always the case,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We'll help later.''

<HEADLINE> Hostage Confirms Hijacker Photos  </HEADLINE>
   By RAMOLA TALWAR BADAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOMBAY, India (AP) -- A physician who treated fellow passengers aboard a
hijacked Indian Airlines plane said Monday that she recognized the faces of the
hijackers in photographs distributed by the Indian government.
</P>
<P>
	   Bombay pathologist Anita Joshi was one of the few hostages to see the
hijackers without their masks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are the same people'' who appeared in photographs published by India
last week, Joshi said at a news conference in Bombay. The identities of the five
hijackers and their home addresses in Pakistan also were published.
</P>
<P>
	   India has blamed Pakistan for the hijacking and called for the hijackers'
arrest. Pakistan has denied the accusations and said the hijackers are in
Indian-held Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
	   One passenger was stabbed to death and a second man was wounded on the first
day of the eight-day hijacking drama, which ended New Year's Eve after India
released three imprisoned activists for Kashmir's independence. The hijackers
escaped.
</P>
<P>
	   In her first public appearance since the hijacking, Joshi said the
hijackers, who spoke in Hindi and Pashto, said they had planned the operation
for two years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They said they saw Hollywood movies and read books on hijacking. They were
perfectly trained and seemed to understand human psychology very well,'' Joshi
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The physician said the hijackers told her they were happy to see foreigners
on the plane when they boarded it Christmas Eve in Katmandu, Nepal, on a flight
to New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They said, 'If one of you (Indians) die, nothing will happen, but if one
of the foreigners dies ... other governments will put pressure on your
government,''' she quoted the hijackers as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   The strain finally got to her four days into the hijacking, Joshi said, and
she broke down. ``I started yelling and told them to shoot me since, anyway, all
of us were mentally prepared to die.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was like slow poison when every hour they'd shout and tell us to put
our heads down or they would kill us,'' Joshi said.
</P>
<P>
	   She said the hijackers had asked her to treat the two passengers whom they
had stabbed when the plane landed at Amritsar airport, the first of several
stops before it was taken to a desert airstrip at Kandahar, Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
	   Rippan Katyal, returning with his bride from his honeymoon, died of his
wounds.
</P>
<P>
	   The hijackers ``said there was a problem with refueling and so they had to
do this. They asked me, `He won't die, will he?' I told them he needed to be
hospitalized immediately. But when I bandaged him the second time I knew Rippan
was in the last stages,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Katyal's body was taken off the plane in Dubai, along with 27 passengers.
His wife, who had been separated in another compartment, was not told what had
happened to him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I couldn't tell her that her husband was dead,'' Joshi said. News spread
that the hijackers had cut the throats of two people. ``But when the others
asked me if the two were alive, I always said yes.''

	   COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa (AP) -- A chicken in every pot? How about: Not a flake
on any driveway.
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Bradley likes to say he's not a typical politician making empty
campaign promises. But the unusual warm temperatures that melted Iowa's infamous
January snows in the past week brought out this whopper of an addition to his
stump speech: ``If you elect me president of the United States, I promise you
there'll be no more winters in Iowa.''
</P>
<P>
	   The mild weather also was messing up his strategy, joked Bradley, who has
been campaigning here since last January.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said he's been wondering, ``when is this winter going to come?''
</P>
<P>
	   As for his no-new-snow pledge, Bradley owned up that it was ``a variation of
'a chicken in every pot,' except it requires a little greater power than a
president has.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Denounces Forbes Ad  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- Gov. George Bush described himself Monday night
as ``a tax cutting person'' who knows how to get it done, disputing and
denouncing a campaign ad in which presidential rival Steve Forbes accuses him of
breaking a pledge against tax increases in Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. John McCain chimed in, saying that the federal tax cut Bush is
proposing now would spend all the projected budget surplus and $20 billion more,
with benefits going to people who don't need them. He also said the Bush plan
would not guarantee funds to guard future Social Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   The tax hassle was the keynote dispute as the six Republican presidential
candidates met in a 90-minute televised debate.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said he has twice led his state to the biggest tax cuts in its history.
His packages included off-setting increases in sales taxes, but Bush said the
result was lower levies on Texans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am a tax cutting person,'' Bush said. ``I know how to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
	   As president, he said, he would see to it that rates are cut for every
American.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes wasn't budging, saying he stood by his ad. ``A pledge should not be
used as a trinket to win an election,'' he said. ``The ad is accurate. ... You
did break that pledge.'' He said things like that make Americans cynical about
politics.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush shot back, ``One thing that makes the American people cynical is
negative advertisements on TV.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Forbes ad points to a 1994 vow Bush made while running for governor,
signing a pledge to an anti-tax group that he would ``oppose any legislation
establishing a state personal income tax or increasing the sales tax.'' Critics
say Bush in 1997 did propose some tax increases to the Texas legislature to help
fund a $3 billion property tax rollback.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was asked whether he would have negotiated with hijackers as the
Indian government did to gain the release of airliner hostages.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No, never,'' McCain said. ``Next question.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator went on to say that as president, he would have mounted
a commando operation. The retired Naval officer and Vietnam POW said that he
would have had the tires shot out and the airliner involved ``would not have
taken off again.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said he agreed with McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   In turn, the GOP candidates, Alan Keyes, Sen. Orrin Hatch, Gary Bauer,
Forbes, McCain and Bush all declared that Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban
boy whose mother died in escaping to Florida, should not be returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   They also said the boy's father, who wants him returned, should be brought
to the United States to make the decision.
</P>
<P>
	   The nationally televised debate, the third in five days for the Republicans,
was staged at Calvin College in a state Bush calls his ``firewall.'' A victory
in Michigan would help him rebound if he gets upset in earlier primary states.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has made the Feb. 22 Michigan primary one of his top four targets,
along with contests in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jan. 24 Iowa caucuses open this year's election cycle.
</P>
<P>
	   In two debates last week, the candidates wrestled with competing tax-cutting
philosophies. Bush wants $483 billion in reductions over five years, with some
of the money returned to low- and middle-income Americans to fit his
``compassionate conservative'' slogan.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who plans to flesh out his plans Tuesday, is proposing a $240
billion, five-year package that expands the lowest income tax bracket and
creates tax-free savings accounts for the middle class.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator's plan is smaller than Bush's because he would save 60
percent of future government surpluses to protect Social Security. The surplus
also would be spent on Medicare and reducing the national debt, under McCain's
plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Taking a swipe at Bush, McCain said at a Holland, Mich., town hall meeting,
``I don't think it is conservative to ignore the Social Security Trust Fund ...
the problems of Medicare or a $5.6 trillion debt.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> Education Tops Calif. Gov. Agenda  </HEADLINE>
   By SCOTT LINDLAW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Gov. Gray Davis said Monday he would devote more
than 40 percent of his proposed $88 billion state budget to education, opening a
second phase in his effort to turn around California's public schools.
</P>
<P>
	   Davis, a Democrat who rode to office in 1998 on a pledge to fix the schools,
is emphasizing teacher training and recruitment in his second year. Last year,
he focused on school accountability and reading.
</P>
<P>
	   For the upcoming year, he proposed spending $277 million on recruiting and
retaining teachers, particularly in low-performing schools, and wants to create
a pioneering student incentive program.
</P>
<P>
	   His proposed budget, which requires legislative approval, would increase
state aid for California's 10,000 public schools from the current $26.4 billion
to $28.2 billion, or from $6,045 to $6,313 per pupil.
</P>
<P>
	   That would still leave the nation's most populous state below the national
average in per-pupil spending. The state's standardized-test scores are also
below average.
</P>
<P>
	   Davis said California's roaring economy eased the task of finding money for
his proposals. His total school spending package was $36.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is the best economy known to man,'' he said. ``You can't possibly ask
for more money to come in than our economy is generating, and we're allocating
as much as we possibly can to enhance the experience for every child.''
</P>
<P>
	   Teaching incentives include $11,000 for the college educations of
prospective teachers who agree to work in schools that rank in the lower half.
Top graduates who seek teaching credentials could compete for $20,000 teaching
fellowships.
</P>
<P>
	   Teachers who become fully credentialed could get $10,000 for a down payment
on a new home, and they and their schools could get a $2,000 bonus. The reward
for teachers with national board certification would triple to $30,000 for those
in the lowest-performing schools.
</P>
<P>
	   Faced with the need to find at least 26,000 new teachers a year for the next
decade, Davis proposes establishing five teacher recruitment centers and letting
retired teachers keep their full pensions if they return to the classroom.
</P>
<P>
	   Rewards for teachers are becoming more common as states begin to face what
the U.S. Department of Education estimates will be a need for 2.2 million new
public school teachers nationally over the next decade, said Eric Hirsch of the
National Conference of State Legislatures in Denver.
</P>
<P>
	   For students, Davis proposed a $118 million-a-year incentive program that
would provide $1,000 college scholarships to ninth-, 10th- and 11-grade students
who score in the top 10 percent statewide or the top 5 percent of their school
class on standard achievement tests.
</P>
<P>
	   Grades would not be a factor in the merit scholarships. That would make
California the only state that rewards students solely for their standardized
test scores, said Shelby Samuelson, a policy analyst at the National Conference
of State Legislatures.
</P>
<P>
	   The governor's budget also provides for $213 million in tax cuts and
credits, including $100 million for property owners who preserve open spaces or
wildlife habitats and $47 million for individuals who care for elderly
relatives.

<HEADLINE> A Campaign's Overreaching Rhetoric  </HEADLINE>
   By CALVIN WOODWARD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Serious campaign-watchers -- the ones who pick over every
nuance and notice every goof -- say this season's wealth of debates is probably
helping the nation learn what's at stake in the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
	   They just wish the candidates would be more careful with their rhetoric and
stop speaking the shorthand that only the political class understands.
</P>
<P>
	   A ``no-tax pledge'' advocated by several Republicans, for example, is
understood in Washington to mean either no new taxes or no higher tax burden
overall. But to everyone else it might sound like taxes would go away.
</P>
<P>
	   Only the politically attuned might realize that when Democrat Al Gore speaks
in debates, ads and speeches of a nation with universal health care, his own
program does not achieve that goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Beyond such specifics, many of the campaigns' claims have been made without
the context that presidents have limited powers. Bedrock promises such as
Republican George W. Bush's tax cuts and Democrat Bill Bradley's health plan
depend on Congress as well as on economic forces out of their control.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They seem to presume that we're in an economic condition that will last
forever,'' says Wayne Fields, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis
who studies rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
	   Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at
the University of Pennsylvania, has been closely following the primary debates
for The Associated Press, helping to check them for misrepresentation,
exaggeration and mistakes.
</P>
<P>
	   An overarching problem she sees is that the candidates are promising things
they cannot alone deliver and taking credit for things they did not alone
achieve.
</P>
<P>
	   The flat tax promised by Republican Steve Forbes cannot be imposed at the
will of a president. In taking credit for reduced juvenile crime in Texas, Gov.
Bush ignores that such crime is down nationally.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are limits to the office (of president) and we have to acknowledge
that,'' Jamieson said. ``Part of what I think seeds cynicism in politics is that
someone 'promised me he would do this.' He meant to promise he'd try very
hard.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``All of these claims should be heard that way, though they're not voiced
that way.''
</P>
<P>
	   In Monday night's debate in Michigan, Bush took credit for a $1 billion tax
cut the Texas Legislature approved after rejecting his plan to cut taxes overall
by three times as much.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I laid out a plan that cut $1 billion in property taxes,'' he asserted.
Bush was defending himself against accusations that he broke a pledge not to
raise taxes by advancing the plan -- which would have raised some sales and
business taxes in return for a larger total cut.
</P>
<P>
	   It doesn't take a political junkie to know that Republican Gary Bauer sent
the hyperbole meter into the red zone when he promised last week to eliminate
the fear of rape by putting rapists in jail longer. ``America's women wouldn't
have to worry about it,'' he said flatly.
</P>
<P>
	   But when GOP Sen. Orrin Hatch declared: ``I've worked with every federal
judge in the last 23 years,'' few could know he was speaking about his role in
approving judicial appointments on the Judiciary Committee -- not as some sort
of super judge who gets around the country a lot.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They forget that the person who is watching this debate and is otherwise
involved in a life outside politics doesn't have the same set of assumptions,''
Jamieson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, she and others who watch political communications say the debates and
even the 30-second advertising spots are providing critical information.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Spots are really important and even though they're short, voters learn
from them,'' said Bill Benoit, a communication professor at the University of
Missouri.
</P>
<P>
	   They learn through the ads, debates and stump speeches of Bush's stature as
the only Republican with executive experience in government, and of rival John
McCain's brave, chilling past as a Vietnam prisoner of war.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Anything that makes them stand up and talk is useful,'' Fields says.
</P>
<P>
	   But only marginally useful, in his mind, at a stage when he says Gore and
Bradley are overreaching to draw distinctions between each other and the
Republican debates are crowded with candidates who won't be standing much
longer.
</P>
<P>
	   Amid all the chatter, some misrepresentations persist, in some cases arising
more from what is not said than from what is.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore takes credit for helping to pass what he calls the most significant gun
control legislation in a generation. Yet the Senate legislation for which he
cast the tie-breaking vote did not become law.
</P>
<P>
	   At the same time, Gore is coming under attack in a Republican National
Committee ad for a position on gays in the military that he has already changed.

<HEADLINE> Bush Denounces Forbes Ad  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- Gov. George Bush described himself Monday night
as ``a tax cutting person'' who knows how to get it done, disputing and
denouncing a campaign ad in which presidential rival Steve Forbes accuses him of
breaking a pledge against tax increases in Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Sen. John McCain chimed in, saying that the federal tax cut Bush is
proposing now would spend all the projected budget surplus and $20 billion more,
with benefits going to people who don't need them. He also said the Bush plan
would not guarantee funds to guard future Social Security benefits.
</P>
<P>
	   The tax hassle was the keynote dispute as the six Republican presidential
candidates met in a 90-minute televised debate.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said he has twice led his state to the biggest tax cuts in its history.
His packages included offsetting increases in sales taxes, but Bush said the
result was lower levies on Texans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am a tax cutting person,'' Bush said. ``I know how to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
	   As president, he said, he would see to it that rates are cut for every
American.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes wasn't budging, saying he stood by his ad. ``A pledge should not be
used as a trinket to win an election,'' he said. ``The ad is accurate. ... You
did break that pledge.'' He said things like that make Americans cynical about
politics.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush shot back, ``One thing that makes the American people cynical is
negative advertisements on TV.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Forbes ad points to a 1994 vow Bush made while running for governor,
signing a pledge to an anti-tax group that he would ``oppose any legislation
establishing a state personal income tax or increasing the sales tax.'' Bush in
1997 supported a tax-cut bill that included some sales tax increases -- an
action critics say violated the pledge. The bill didn't pass; Bush later signed
a tax-cut measure into law, saying he supported the earlier bill in order to
move the process along.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was asked whether he would have negotiated with hijackers as the
Indian government did to gain the release of airliner hostages.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No, never,'' McCain said. ``Next question.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator went on to say that as president, he would have mounted
a commando operation. The retired Naval officer and Vietnam POW said that he
would have had the tires shot out and the airliner involved ``would not have
taken off again.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said he agreed with McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   In turn, the GOP candidates, Alan Keyes, Sen. Orrin Hatch, Gary Bauer,
Forbes, McCain and Bush all declared that Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban
boy whose mother died in escaping to Florida, should not be returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   They also said the boy's father, who wants him returned, should be brought
to the United States to make the decision.
</P>
<P>
	   The nationally televised debate, the third in five days for the Republicans,
was staged at Calvin College in a state Bush calls his ``firewall.'' A victory
in Michigan would help him rebound if he gets upset in earlier primary states.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has made the Feb. 22 Michigan primary one of his top four targets,
along with contests in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jan. 24 Iowa caucuses open this year's election cycle.
</P>
<P>
	   In two debates last week, the candidates also wrestled with competing
tax-cutting philosophies. Bush wants $483 billion in reductions over five years,
with some of the money returned to low- and middle-income Americans to fit his
``compassionate conservative'' slogan.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who plans to flesh out his plans Tuesday, is proposing a $240
billion, five-year package that expands the lowest income tax bracket and
creates tax-free savings accounts for the middle class.
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator's plan is smaller than Bush's because he would save 60
percent of future government surpluses to protect Social Security. The surplus
also would be spent on Medicare and reducing the national debt, under McCain's
plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Taking a swipe at Bush, McCain said at a Holland, Mich., town hall meeting,
``I don't think it is conservative to ignore the Social Security Trust Fund ...
the problems of Medicare or a $5.6 trillion debt.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush dismissed McCain's plan, which is a revision of a smaller package
produced by the Arizona senator in June. Using reporters to send McCain a
message, Bush said: ``Is this your final tax plan?''
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes still supports a flat tax, an income tax overhaul he touted in his
failed 1996 campaign. The millionaire magazine publisher has broadened his
message to include social issues in an attempt to court conservative voters.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain is trying to change the subject from ethics to taxes, after spending
a week fielding journalists' questions about his work in the Senate on behalf of
major donors. In the town hall meeting, a voter asked McCain to explain himself
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was doing my job and we're releasing all the letters I've written'' to
federal agencies on behalf of political supporters, McCain said. ``But, look,
this is a tough business and I understand these things happen along the way.''
</P>
<P>
	   The centerpiece of McCain's campaign is a promise to clean up the political
culture.

<HEADLINE> Energy Accused of Bungling Project  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Development of the world's largest laser has been marred
by overly optimistic expectations, management bungling and inadequate attention
by senior officials, a task force of scientists said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The $1.5 billion Energy Department project at Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory has been under intense scrutiny since last September, when it was
found to be three years behind schedule and facing $350 million in cost
overruns.
</P>
<P>
	   Only six months earlier, the head of the California weapons laboratory had
told a congressional hearing the project was on schedule and within budget.
</P>
<P>
	   The so-called National Ignition Facility project consists if an
unprecedented array of sophisticated and powerful lasers that are to be key to
monitoring and maintaining America's nuclear weapons without actual bomb
testing.
</P>
<P>
	   A report Monday by a panel appointed by Energy Secretary Bill Richardson to
review the project found significant shortcomings in both management and how the
project was designed from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
	   While the panel said it had not uncovered ``any technical or managerial
obstacles'' to completing the project, ``serious challenges and hurdles
remain.''
</P>
<P>
	   The report to Richardson amounted to scathing critique of the handling of
the 3-year-old laser project by both the Energy Department, which underestimated
its complexity and cost, and by Lawrence Livermore, which was accused of not
giving it top-level attention.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said senior DOE officials and those at Livermore viewed the
project as if it were conventional construction and failed to grasp complexities
of fabricating and assembling a laser system 40 to 50 times more powerful than
anything now in use.
</P>
<P>
	   Since its inception in 1997, the project has been the target of a dozen
scientific and management reviews.
</P>
<P>
	   Last March, Bruce Tarter, Livermore's director, told a congressional hearing
the project was ``on budget and on schedule'' to be completed by 2003.
Laboratory officials gave the same optimistic assessment to Richardson in June.
</P>
<P>
	   Then last September, Richardson was told that serious problems had developed
in assembling the sophisticated laser optics for the 192-beam system, requiring
a $350 million cost overrun and probably four years of delay.
</P>
<P>
	   The task force report reiterated findings that were much the same but said
the project, although technically feasible, is being broadly reworked. The
reworking will be completed in March, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   John McTague, a former vice president of Ford Motor Co. and the task force
chairman, said underestimation of the project's complexity had resulted in
``unrealistic expectations.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were unrealistic because there wasn't enough fleshing out of the
hows, the practical hows, of getting the system built,'' McTague said in a
telephone exchange with reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   The panel urged that the project adopt a new, two-phase approach: build only
half of the system, or a 92-beam laser, then proceed with the other 92 beams
after a two-year test period. McTague said that could bring the project to
completion by 2007.
</P>
<P>
	   In reviewing the project, the panel said DOE's senior defense officials
underestimated its cost because they didn't take into account its complexities
and uncertainties. Instead, the panel said it approved a budget ``appropriate
for (building) an apartment building but ... not appropriate for a
technologically intensive project'' such as the ignition facility.
</P>
<P>
	   The panel also sharply criticized Lawrence Livermore top management and the
University of California, which manages the federal weapons lab, for not paying
close enough top-level attention to the project.
</P>
<P>
	   Tarter, Livermore's director, did not take ``visible or unambiguous
ownership'' of the laser project or ``create an environment that will not allow
for surprises,'' the report said. McTague said a problem was that while the NIF
project was as large as any of the lab's departments, it did not report directly
to the lab director's office.

<HEADLINE> $2.7B Sought for Uninsured Kids  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With millions of uninsured children eligible for federal
health programs, President Clinton will ask Congress for $2.7 billion to make it
easier for states and families to sign kids up, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore planned to highlight the plan Tuesday in Iowa. Health
policy, and how to get insurance to 44 million uninsured Americans, has emerged
as the most significant debate between Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley, who
are locked in a battle for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore also will publicize a new report that finds enrollment in the
Children's Health Insurance Program has doubled in the last year to about 2
million children. Clinton signed CHIP, as the program is called, into law in
1997.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're really encouraged with the trend,'' Chris Jennings, Clinton's health
policy adviser, said Monday. ``The president feels that these numbers bode well
for the future. But he also feels strongly that we need to provide additional
tools for states to enroll kids and to eliminate barriers that have limited
coverage.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's plan would make it easier for children in the federal school lunch
program to enroll in health programs and would allow child-care centers,
homeless shelters and other offices to immediately enroll children. It also
would require many states to simplify Medicaid application forms and let more
19- and 20-year-olds into the programs.
</P>
<P>
	   There are 11 million uninsured children in the United States, although more
than a third are eligible for Medicaid or for CHIP, which helps children whose
families earn too much for Medicaid but not enough to buy insurance on their
own.
</P>
<P>
	   The initiative, a part of Clinton's budget request to Congress for 2001,
would build on these existing programs. It's much like Gore's plan, and many of
the details are virtually identical.
</P>
<P>
	   Specifically, the new budget proposal would:
</P>
<P>
	   --Allow school lunch programs, which also serve low-income children, to
share information with Medicaid officials. A recent study found that almost 4
million uninsured children are in the lunch program, making it a prime place to
find them.
</P>
<P>
	   --Allow child care centers, homeless shelters and welfare offices to enroll
kids right away while their applications for health coverage are being
processed.
</P>
<P>
	   --Require states that have simple CHIP applications also use simpler
applications for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
	   Going further, Gore also would allow more people into CHIP, including
children in families with higher incomes and some parents. The White House is
considering making a similar budget request, but no decision has been made, a
White House official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley take an altogether different approach. He would scrap Medicaid and
CHIP and give poor families subsidies to buy coverage through the federal
workers' insurance plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Medicaid, which provides free health insurance for the poor, traditionally
has had trouble attracting all who qualify for it. Many parents don't even know
about it. Some who do see it as a welfare program and want to avoid what they
consider the embarrassment of accepting welfare. And many states have
complicated application forms or limited hours of service, which make signing up
difficult.
</P>
<P>
	   Those problems are highlighted in a report being released this week by the
Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured. The study of 1,335 low-income
parents found that two-thirds with eligible but uninsured children have tried to
enroll their children but couldn't. More than half gave up because of the
difficulty of the process or were denied coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   The new children's health program seeks to avoid many of those pitfalls with
simpler applications, friendly program names and cost-sharing, where families
pay a small part of the premium and avoid the welfare stigma.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of uninsured children rose in 1998, and CHIP enrolled only about
1 million kids in its first year. That left policy-makers wondering if that
program will suffer from similar problems. With the second year's enrollment
doubled, the White House is celebrating, and Gore, no doubt, will be too.
</P>
<P>
	   The new report notes that states are letting more children into the program
than the first year. Federal law allows into the program children whose
families' incomes are below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, or about
$33,000 for a family of four. Some states set the limit lower.
</P>
<P>
	   In March 1997, just four states covered youngsters up to 200 percent of
poverty. Today, 30 states are doing so or plan to.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador To Adopt Dollar As Currency  </HEADLINE>
   By MONTE HAYES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- Ecuador will gradually replace its currency with the
U.S. dollar to stabilize the Andean nation's economy and prevent hyperinflation,
government officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Juan Falconi, the production minister, said sucres currently in circulation
would be bought back over the next year and only small denomination sucre coins
would be used.
</P>
<P>
	   Finance Minister Alfredo Arizaga said in a television interview Monday that
Ecuador has $400 million worth of sucres in circulation and holds foreign cash
reserves worth $900 million. That ratio ``means there will be no problem in
swapping sucres for dollars,'' Arizaga said.
</P>
<P>
	   The dark orange 50,000 sucre note, the largest denomination, which bears the
national seal and a portrait of former President Eloy Alfaro, will be replaced
with the American greenback under the plan. Under current exchange rates, 50,000
sucres are worth only $2, forcing shoppers to carry small bricks of cash to make
purchases.
</P>
<P>
	   President Jamil Mahuad announced Sunday night that he was pegging the
exchange rate at 25,000 sucres to the dollar, but details of his plan to make
the U.S. dollar Ecuador's official currency only became clear on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahuad, a Harvard-educated political centrist who took office in August
1998, has faced growing calls to resign after failing to stop the rapid decline
of Ecuador's economy.
</P>
<P>
	   The economy shrank 7 percent and inflation topped 60 percent in 1999, the
highest in Latin America. Many economists predicted that speculation against the
sucre would quickly send Ecuador into hyperinflation this year if the government
did not act.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahuad said Sunday night that replacing the currency was ``the only way out
that we have, and it is the road that we have to travel.'' He predicted that
adopting the dollar would reduce annual inflation to 10 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Ecuador's Central Bank opposed the move, but Mahuad warned that he would
call a special session of Congress on Tuesday to fire any Central Bank
executives who tried to block the measure.
</P>
<P>
	   The step means the Central Bank will lose control of much of Ecuador's
monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
	   Scrapping a national currency means a government can no longer print extra
money to meet its budget, thus eliminating a major cause of inflation. Boosting
the money supply devalues the currency.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States technically cannot block a country from adopting the
dollar, but such a move typically involves consultation with U.S. officials.
There was no immediate public response Monday from the U.S. Treasury department.
</P>
<P>
	   Political analyst Cesar Montufar criticized the move, saying it would erode
the nation's sovereignty and make ``the president of the U.S. Federal Reserve''
Ecuador's true president.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of people gathered outside currency exchange offices early Monday
expressed mixed feelings about the announcement.
</P>
<P>
	   Luis Vargas, a merchant, was happy with the news.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We'll be able to work because we can bring merchandise from abroad and we
won't have to face this terrible variation in the value of the currency,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The sucre recently plunged 20 percent in less than a week to 29,000 to the
dollar. A year ago, the sucre was valued at 7,000 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
	   Mahuad's announcement came after a tense week of street protests and rumors
that Ecuador's military was planning a coup. The military high command issued a
statement Saturday expressing support for Ecuador's democratically elected
government.
</P>
<P>
	   Business and labor leaders have accused Mahuad of incompetence, and several
leftist-led organizations demonstrated on Thursday in Ecuador's main cities to
demand Mahuad's ouster.
</P>
<P>
	   Police used tear gas to disperse 1,000 demonstrators who tried to march on
the presidential palace, and the government called a state of emergency, giving
the armed forces authority to maintain order and detain protesters.
</P>
<P>
	   Panama is the only other Latin American nation to use the U.S. dollar as its
official currency. The Central American country has avoided the inflation that
has afflicted other nations in the region, since it could not print currency to
back up excessive government spending.
</P>
<P>
	   The International Monetary Fund said it was ready to dispatch a team to
Quito to provide Ecuadorean officials help ``in adapting their fiscal and
banking strategies to dollarization.''
</P>
<P>
	   IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said the group ``looks forward to
working with the authorities to support their economic program.''

<HEADLINE> Regulators Quiet on AOL-Time Warner  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Regulators who may have to approve a mega-deal between
Time Warner and AOL were noticeably quiet Monday, but the proposed merger
received a chilly reception on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Communications Commission declined to comment on whether the
proposed merger would trigger a fullscale review by the commission. The FCC
typically looks at whether deals involving communication companies are in the
public interest. That evaluation is separate from the review conducted by
antitrust regulators.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department said it was unclear whether it or the Federal Trade
Commission will be asked to evaluate the proposed merger for antitrust concerns.
Each agency has its own group of antitrust experts, and they typically split
regulatory reviews after deciding among themselves whose experts are most
appropriate.
</P>
<P>
	   Some observers predicted that the deal would clear regulatory hurdles,
namely because it involves two companies operating in distinct arenas.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There are enough players who also do this stuff that I don't see anything
incredibly onerous about it,'' said Kip Martin, an analyst with Meta Group,
based in Stamford, Conn. ``There are lots of other content-creators, and a lot
of other access mechanisms out there.''
</P>
<P>
	   Matthew Fairshter, an antitrust lawyer based in Pasadena, Calif., also said
he didn't anticipate any major roadblocks now. But the combined entity could
eventually give rise to concerns about rival Internet companies getting equal
access to cable TV lines over which to deliver their services, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not sure that this has any big road bumps to get over,'' Fairshter
said. There ``could be some concerns about access to the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
	   Members of Congress voiced those very worries on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At some point, all of this concentration and convergence has implications
for consumers because it will minimize competition and choice, giving us fewer
voices and fewer pipelines in the marketplace,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt,
the Senate Judiciary Committee's top Democrat. ``What we should do is to make
sure that all that information does not become funneled and controlled by just
two or three sources.''
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said his committee would
study the merger carefully and expected to be briefed by representatives from
both companies this week. Other members of the committee's antitrust panel said
they would hold hearings.
</P>
<P>
	   Some lawmakers and consumer advocates took announcement of the massive
merger as an opportunity to renew their push for a national policy requiring
cable companies -- like AT&AMP;T and a combined AOL/Time Warner -- to give rivals
equal access to cable lines over which to deliver high-speed Internet
connections.
</P>
<P>
	   ``From a policy standpoint, consumer choice must be fostered for
Internet-based telecommunications services,'' said Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., a
member of the House Commerce telecommunications subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
	   The openNET Coalition, a lobbying group of which AOL is a key member, said
it will continue to press the federal government to require that cable companies
share their lines with competing Internet providers.
</P>
<P>
	   The FCC, thus far, has declined to do so, saying it prefers to let the
marketplace resolve the issue.

<HEADLINE> No. 2 Pentagon Official Resigns  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John Hamre, the deputy secretary of defense who oversaw
the Pentagon's largely successful inoculations against the Y2K computer bug, is
resigning to become head of a major think tank.
</P>
<P>
	   In announcing the surprise move Monday, Defense Secretary William Cohen said
he had recommended that President Clinton nominate Rudy de Leon to replace
Hamre. De Leon has been the Pentagon's under secretary for personnel and
readiness for the past two years and previously was undersecretary of the Air
Force.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton praised Hamre as ``a respected, decisive and forward-looking
leader.'' He said Hamre had implemented innovative defense management
initiatives and defense contracting reforms. ``His impact in these areas will be
felt long after his departure.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hamre, 49, came to the Pentagon in 1993 to be comptroller during the late
Les Aspin's tenure as defense secretary. He held that post until Cohen made him
his top deputy in July 1997, a position Hamre used to push for modernizing the
Pentagon's business practices and improving the security of its computer
systems.
</P>
<P>
	   ``John Hamre has been my friend and partner in running the department,''
Cohen said in a written statement. ``He approaches all issues with extreme
confidence and an extraordinary sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview after Monday's announcement, Hamre said his proudest
accomplishment as deputy defense secretary was spurring the department to
organize a defense against state-sponsored attacks on its computer systems. He
took up that effort after an unsettling incident in early 1998, at a time of
heightened tensions with Iraq, which at first appeared to be a foreign
government-directed ``cyberattack.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We found out we weren't very well organized for it,'' Hamre said.
</P>
<P>
	   The incident proved to be just another private hacker intrusion, but Hamre
said there have been cases since of state-sponsored attacks on Pentagon
computers. He said details of those incidents are secret.
</P>
<P>
	   Hamre took the lead in preparing the Defense Department's far-flung computer
networks for the Y2K rollover. At a cost of $3.6 billion, the effort was
successful except for a temporary New Year's Eve breakdown of a ground station
computer that processes information from a constellation of intelligence
satellites.
</P>
<P>
	   A native of South Dakota, Hamre will leave the Pentagon on March 31 and
become president and chief executive officer of the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, or CSIS. In a written statement released by CSIS, Hamre
said he considered the post a ``once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
	   In joining the think tank Hamre will reconnect with Sam Nunn, former
Democratic senator from Georgia who was chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee while Hamre was a committee staff member. Nunn, chairman of CSIS's
board of trustees, said Hamre will take over on April 3.
</P>
<P>
	   CSIS ranks among the nation's most prominent public policy research
institutions. It was founded in 1962 by David M. Abshire and the late Adm.
Arleigh Burke. The center's current president is Richard Fairbanks, an
ambassador-at-large in the Reagan administration. Fairbanks called Hamre ``the
ideal individual'' to lead CSIS into the new century.
</P>
<P>
	   Like Hamre, de Leon has worked in the Pentagon since the Clinton
administration began.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen credited de Leon with tackling many of the Pentagon's toughest
problems, including most recently a growing controversy over the way the
services implement the administration's policy on homosexuals in the military.
</P>
<P>
	   De Leon also has been overseeing an Army investigation of allegations that
American troops killed hundreds of South Korean civilians in the opening weeks
of the Korean War in 1950. He also has been at the center of so far unsuccessful
efforts to regain Navy use of the Vieques training range in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
	   De Leon was undersecretary of the Air Force from 1994-97. He was staff
director for the House Armed Services Committee for four years before Aspin
brought him to the Pentagon as a special assistant in 1993.

<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks surged early Tuesday, bolstered by big gains
on Wall Street. The dollar was lower against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average climbed 518.88 points, or 2.85
percent, to 18,712.29 points in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Friday, the
average closed up 25.14 points, or 0.14 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 105.24 yen, down 0.08 yen from late Friday in Tokyo but
above its late New York level of 105.20 yen overnight.
</P>
<P>
	   Financial markets in Tokyo were closed Monday for a national holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tokyo's stock market, prices started higher Tuesday in post-holiday
trading, following a new closing high in the Dow Jones industrial average at
11,572.20 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Early gainers in Tokyo included high-technology and communications issues,
which were boosted by gains in U.S. counterparts following news of a proposed
merger between America Online and Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up 61.95 points, or 3.87 percent, to 1,660.96 points. The TOPIX
closed down 10.58 points, or 0.66 percent, on Friday
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, though it fell from its Friday level in Tokyo, the
dollar edged higher compared with the New York level as demand for U.S. stocks
boosted buying of the greenback.

<HEADLINE> Agent: Mayor Milton Milan signed promissory note with accused  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - Camden Mayor Milton Milan signed a $2,500 promissory
note with an alleged drug kingpin accused of running the largest cocaine cartel
in the city's history, a witness in a federal drug trial said Monday.
<P>
	   It is the second time that Milan's name has emerged in U.S. District Court,
where Jose "J.R." Rivera and Luis "Tun Tun" Figueroa are on trial on drug
conspiracy charges.
</P>
<P>
	   Rivera and Figueroa are two of 14 people charged with operating a ring that
prosecutors say controlled a highly profitable city drug market for a decade.
They are the only ones to stand trial and many of their former associates are
expected to testify against them in exchange for plea agreements with federal
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, another witness dropped a bombshell when he alleged that Milan
bought cocaine from the organization in 1993 - before Milan became mayor in
1997. Milan has angrily denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest testimony came Monday from FBI Agent William Grace, who said the
promissory note was among nearly 200 documents seized by agents when they raided
Rivera's gym and auto parts business in February 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The note was dated October 14, 1992 and was on the letterhead of MTM
Contracting Co., Grace said. It was titled "promissory note to pay" and read, in
part:
</P>
<P>
	   "Milan hereby promises to pay back Jose Rivera the amount of $5,000," Grace
testified. That amount, however, was scratched out and $2,500 was written in, he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The note was initialed "M.M." and signed by Milan and Rivera, Grace said.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors did not question Grace about the document and declined to
elaborate on it. The document was among dozens of items presented in court
Monday, including weapons and ammunition seized in the raids, a bulletproof
vest, bank records and a safe that contained more than $200,000 in cash.
</P>
<P>
	   Milan declined comment from his City Hall Office and referred inquiries to
his lawyer, Carlos Martir, who also represents Figueroa. Martir said he was
unaware of any business relationship between Milan and Rivera.and
</P>
<P>
	   "The document speaks for itself," Martir said. "It may have been a loan. I
don't know what for."
</P>
<P>
	   Milan is not charged in the drug case. However, last summer federal
authorities raided his home and City Hall as part of a federal investigation
into alleged corruption in Camden.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Camildo Cruz, the same witnesses who alleged that Milan purchased
cocaine in 1993, testified that he worked briefly for Milan at his construction
company in 1995 and that Rivera contacted Milan for help in getting Cruz the
job.
</P>
<P>
	   Cruz, 34, returned to the stand Monday, undergoing several hours of
cross-examination by the defense, which tried to undermine his testimony. He
made no reference to Milan.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors say Rivera, 40, was the major drug procurer and financier for
the cartel and Figueroa, 34, was an enforcer who used violence to protect the
ring.
</P>
<P>
	   Law enforcement officials have said the organization ran a
multi-million-dollar-a-year business, and was the most entrenched and
significant drug cartel in Camden's history.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities allege that the ring moved large quantities of cocaine from
Puerto Rico through Florida and New York. The ring infiltrated the Camden police
department, and a former detective assigned as a bodyguard to Milan admitted
supplying the ring with an illegal weapon.
</P>
<P>
	   Testimony in the trial resumes Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Energy Accused of Bungling Project  </HEADLINE>
   By H. JOSEF HEBERT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Development of the world's largest laser has been marred
by overly optimistic expectations, management bungling and inadequate attention
by senior officials, a task force of scientists said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The $1.5 billion Energy Department project at Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory has been under intense scrutiny since last September, when it was
found to be three years behind schedule and facing $350 million in cost
overruns.
</P>
<P>
	   Only six months earlier, the head of the California weapons laboratory had
told a congressional hearing the project was on schedule and within budget.
</P>
<P>
	   The so-called National Ignition Facility project consists if an
unprecedented array of sophisticated and powerful lasers that are to be key to
monitoring and maintaining America's nuclear weapons without actual bomb
testing.
</P>
<P>
	   A report Monday by a panel appointed by Energy Secretary Bill Richardson to
review the project found significant shortcomings in both management and how the
project was designed from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
	   While the panel said it had not uncovered ``any technical or managerial
obstacles'' to completing the project, ``serious challenges and hurdles
remain.''
</P>
<P>
	   The report to Richardson amounted to scathing critique of the handling of
the 3-year-old laser project by both the Energy Department, which underestimated
its complexity and cost, and by Lawrence Livermore, which was accused of not
giving it top-level attention.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said senior DOE officials and those at Livermore viewed the
project as if it were conventional construction and failed to grasp the
complexities of fabricating and assembling a laser system 40 to 50 times more
powerful than anything now in use.
</P>
<P>
	   Since its inception in 1997, the project has been the target of a dozen
scientific and management reviews.
</P>
<P>
	   Last March, Bruce Tarter, Livermore's director, told a congressional hearing
the project was ``on budget and on schedule'' to be completed by 2003.
Laboratory officials gave the same optimistic assessment to Richardson in June.
</P>
<P>
	   Then last September, Richardson was told that serious problems had developed
in assembling the sophisticated laser optics for the 192-beam system, requiring
a $350 million cost overrun and probably four years of delay.
</P>
<P>
	   The task force report reiterated findings that were much the same but said
the project, although technically feasible, is being broadly reworked. The
reworking will be completed in March, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   John McTague, a former vice president of Ford Motor Co. and the task force
chairman, said underestimation of the project's complexity had resulted in
``unrealistic expectations.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were unrealistic because there wasn't enough fleshing out of the
hows, the practical hows, of getting the system built,'' McTague said in a
telephone exchange with reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   The panel urged that the project adopt a new, two-phase approach: build only
half of the system, or a 96-beam laser, then proceed with the other 96 beams
after a two-year test period. McTague said that could bring the project to
completion by 2007.
</P>
<P>
	   In reviewing the project, the panel said DOE's senior defense officials
underestimated its cost because they didn't take into account its complexities
and uncertainties. Instead, the panel said it approved a budget ``appropriate
for (building) an apartment building but ... not appropriate for a
technologically intensive project'' such as the ignition facility.
</P>
<P>
	   The panel also sharply criticized Lawrence Livermore top management and the
University of California, which manages the federal weapons lab, for not paying
close enough top-level attention to the project.
</P>
<P>
	   Tarter, Livermore's director, did not take ``visible or unambiguous
ownership'' of the laser project or ``create an environment that will not allow
for surprises,'' the report said. McTague said a problem was that while the NIF
project was as large as any of the lab's departments, it did not report directly
to the lab director's office.

<HEADLINE> 25 Species of Apes Said Endangered  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Not one species of primates has been lost in the past
century, but now 25 species of apes, monkeys, lemurs and other primates are
imperiled and may soon disappear, experts warned Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "As we enter the new millennium, we risk losing our closest living relatives
in the animal kingdom," said Russell Mittermeier, president of Conservation
International.
</P>
<P>
	   The conservation group issued a report that said the main causes of decline
of the primates are the destruction of tropical habitat and attacks by local
hunters as well as the animals' capture for the pet trade and export for
biomedical research.
</P>
<P>
	   The most endangered primates, according to the study, include the golden
bamboo lemur in Madagascar, the yellow-tailed woolly monkey in the tropical
Andes, the mountain gorilla in central Africa and the Tonkin snub-nosed monkey
of Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
	   "The plight of primates is a jarring wake-up call," said Peter Seligmann,
chairman of Conservation International. "Our planet is on the brink of a major
extinction crisis."
</P>
<P>
	   Other primates on the 25-most-imperiled list are:
</P>
<P>
	   The Lac Alaotra bamboo lemur, the Perrier's sifaka, the silky sifaka and the
golden-crowned sifaka, all in Madagascar and the Indian Ocean islands; the
golden lion tamarin, the black lion tamarin, the black-faced lion tamarin, the
buff-headed capuchin and the northern muriqui, all in Brazil; the Miss Waldron's
red colobus, white-naped mangabey, Sclater's guenon, the drill gorilla, and the
cross-river gorilla, all in West Africa; the sanje mangabey in Kenya and
Tanzania; the Delacour's langur, Cat Ba Island golden-headed langur and the
gray-shanked douc langur, all in Vietnam; the Hainan gibbon in China; and the
Sumatran orangutan and the Javan gibbon, both in Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Former Journal Editor Cony Dies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Edward Cony, a former managing editor of The Wall Street
Journal, Dow Jones executive and Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter, has died. He
was 76.
</P>
<P>
	   Cony died Sunday at a nursing home in Aptos, Calif., said Dick Tofel, a
spokesman for Dow Jones &AMP; Co, which publishes the Journal. The cause was
complications from pneumonia.
</P>
<P>
	   Cony started at the Journal as a reporter in the San Francisco bureau in
1953 and stayed with the newspaper for 35 years. He received the Pulitzer Prize
for national reporting in 1961. He was bureau chief and regional news manager
before he was named the Journal's managing editor in 1965.
</P>
<P>
	   Cony was named executive editor of Dow Jones publications and news services
in 1970, and he took on the role of vice president of Dow Jones in 1972.
</P>
<P>
	   He served as president of the Dow Jones Newspaper Fund from 1981 through
1988, and he was an associate editor at the Journal from 1986 until his
retirement in 1988.
</P>
<P>
	   Cony served as a president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors and
the Associated Press Managing Editors Association. When Cony retired, the APME
newsletter called him ``the boss you would like to have.'' At about the same
time, Cony disclosed that he was suffering from the early stages of Alzheimer's
disease.
</P>
<P>
	   He was born in Maine and served in the Army during World War II. He
graduated from Reed College and earned a master's degree in journalism from
Stanford University in 1951.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Gov't Ally Critcizes Boy Order  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA, Cuba (AP) -- Thousands of protesters demanding the return of
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez fell silent Monday upon hearing the announcement that
an American judge had ordered the boy to stay in the United States until at
least March.
</P>
<P>
	   The demonstrators had gathered for the latest in a monthlong string of
rallies lobbying for Elian to be returned from Miami to Cuba and be reunited
with his father. Many looked stunned when Hassan Perez, head of student group
tied to the government, announced the decision that had come that day in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   The order issued by Miami-Dade County Circuit Judge Rosa Rodriguez was
``illegal and arbitrary,'' charged Perez, president of the government's
Federation of University Students.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Who are these beasts?'' asked Perez, referring to Cuban exiles in Miami
who he said would use ``all of their resources to impede the child's return.''
</P>
<P>
	   The temporary protective order -- issued Monday in defiance of a federal
government order that Elian be returned to Cuba by Friday -- sets a March 6
hearing for Rodriguez to hear arguments by Elian's Miami relatives seeking to
keep him in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found Thanksgiving Day clinging to an innertube off Florida's
coast. His mother was lost at sea in the apparent attempt to emigrate illegally
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   By the time the news was being announced in Miami late Monday afternoon,
thousands were already crowding around the U.S. Interests Section on Havana's
main coastal highway for the pro-Elian rally announced in the morning.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the idea is absurd,'' Cuban protester Leonil Feliu said of the
judge's ruling. ``What they are doing is prolonging the process. They know at
the end of the day that they have to bring him to Cuba, all they are doing is
lengthening the inevitable.''

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Spar Over Taxes  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- Gov. George Bush described himself Monday night
as ``a tax cutting person'' who delivered in Texas and would as president, while
Sen. John McCain said his tax plan is ``far better'' for lower and middle income
Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   Taxes were the keynote argument in the third Republican campaign debate in
five days, stirred by Steve Forbes' television ad attacking Bush on grounds he
reneged on a pledge against any tax increases in Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain chimed in, saying that the federal tax cut Bush is proposing now
would spend all the projected budget surplus and $20 billion more, with
two-thirds of the cut going to the wealthiest 10 percent of Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he wants surpluses used to protect Social Security. ``For us to put
all of the surplus into tax cuts, I think, is not a conservative effort,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Disputing the Forbes ad, Bush said he has twice led his state to the biggest
tax cuts in its history. His packages included offsetting increases in sales
taxes, but Bush said the result was lower levies on Texans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am a tax cutting person,'' Bush said. ``I know how to get it done.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes wasn't budging, saying he stood by his ad. ``A pledge should not be
used as a trinket to win an election,'' he said. ``The ad is accurate. ... You
did break that pledge.'' He said things like that make Americans cynical about
politics.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush shot back, ``One thing that makes the American people cynical is
negative advertisements on TV.'' Later, Bush said he would not do to other
candidates what Forbes did to Bob Dole, the GOP nominee in 1996, who emerged
from the primary campaign weakened by Forbes attack ads.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You're not going to win the White House by making pledges that are then
broken,'' Forbes said. ``We've been through that before, particularly on
taxes.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the 1988 presidential campaign, Bush's father made ``read my lips, no new
taxes'' a regular pledge. As president, he accepted tax increases to get a
deficit-cutting budget deal, and the issue was turned against him in his losing
reelection bid in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   The Forbes ad points to a 1994 vow Gov. Bush made while running for
governor, signing a pledge to an anti-tax group that he would ``oppose any
legislation establishing a state personal income tax or increasing the sales
tax.'' Bush in 1997 supported a tax-cut bill that included some sales tax
increases -- an action critics say violated the pledge. The bill didn't pass;
Bush later signed a tax-cut measure into law, saying he supported the earlier
bill in order to move the process along.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Forbes confronted Bush again, this time on abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let's take a dream ride for a moment,'' he said, ``let's pretend that you
get the nomination.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I accept that premise,'' Bush put in.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes then challenged Bush to promise that as nominee, he would preserve
the anti-abortion plank in the Republican campaign platform, and would promise
to pick a running mate and nominate judges committed to end abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said he would choose a vice president who agrees with his policies and
is qualified to be president, would name federal judges who strictly interpret
the law, and would ``work to keep the Republican Party pro-life.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Vagaries aren't going to work'' Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You may not like the answer, but that's the answer,'' Bush told him.
</P>
<P>
	   Five of the six candidates hedged on an administration plan for aid to
Africa to fight the AIDS epidemic. Sen. Orrin Hatch said he agreed with the $150
million in assistance. Bush, McCain and Forbes said they favored helping, but
only with guarantees that the money would actually go to the people in need, not
to corrupt governments.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain was asked whether he would have negotiated with hijackers as the
Indian government did to gain the release of airliner hostages.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No, never,'' McCain said. ``Next question.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Arizona senator went on to say that as president, he would have mounted
a commando operation. The retired Naval officer and Vietnam POW said that he
would have had the tires shot out and the airliner involved ``would not have
taken off again.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said he agreed with McCain.
</P>
<P>
	   In turn, the GOP candidates, Alan Keyes, Hatch, Gary Bauer, Forbes, McCain
and Bush all declared that Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban boy whose mother
died in escaping to Florida, should not be returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   They also said the boy's father, who wants him returned, should be brought
to the United States to make the decision.
</P>
<P>
	   The nationally televised debate, the third in five days for the Republicans,
was staged at Calvin College in a state Bush calls his ``firewall.'' A victory
in Michigan would help him rebound if he gets upset in earlier primary states.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has made the Feb. 22 Michigan primary one of his top four targets,
along with contests in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jan. 24 Iowa caucuses open this year's election cycle.
</P>
<P>
	   In two debates last week, the candidates also wrestled with competing
tax-cutting philosophies. Bush wants $483 billion in reductions over five years,
with some of the money returned to low- and middle-income Americans to fit his
``compassionate conservative'' slogan.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who plans to flesh out his plans Tuesday, is proposing a $240
billion, five-year package that expands the lowest income tax bracket and
creates tax-free savings accounts for the middle class.
</P>
<P>
	   His plan is smaller than Bush's because he would save 63 percent of future
budget surpluses to finance Social Security. He also would use the surplus on
Medicare and reducing the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes still supports a flat tax, an income tax overhaul he touted in his
failed 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain is trying to change the subject from ethics to taxes, after spending
a week fielding journalists' questions about his work in the Senate on behalf of
major donors. The centerpiece of McCain's campaign is a promise to clean up the
political culture.

<HEADLINE> SBC Wants in Texas Long-Distance  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- SBC Communications asked federal regulators Monday to let
it provide long-distance telephone service in Texas, hoping to round out the
package of services it offers to local customers in the state.
</P>
<P>
	   The request comes shortly after a landmark decision by the Federal
Communications Commission to permit Bell Atlantic to offer long-distance to
local customers in New York. SBC filed an application Monday with the FCC
seeking to do the same in Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   SBC wants to position itself to complete the bundle of services -- local
phone, Internet, wireless and even direct satellite broadcast television --
already available to Texas customers. Long-distance calling is a key piece in
giving consumers a one-stop-shopping option.
</P>
<P>
	   Company officials said their bid to enter Texas' long-distance business
would put pressure on other carriers in both the local and long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will be the impetus for lots of competition here,'' said Bob Ferguson,
SBC president for federal relations. The company eventually wants to offer
long-distance throughout its territory. California is likely to be among the
next states it seeks approval for.
</P>
<P>
	   While not tipping their business plans, company officials pledged that their
future long-distance customers would not be charged a minimum monthly fee.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think you can expect our company to be a very aggressive and innovative
competitor in this market,'' said Jim Shelley, president of SBC regulatory
affairs.
</P>
<P>
	   If its application is approved, SBC would become the second Baby Bell to
offer long-distance service to its local customers. Bell Atlantic won the right
to do so in New York last month.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts say the prospects for SBC getting approval are good, especially
since one Bell already has forged a path. They added that the company has worked
hard to show that its local Texas phone business is open to competition -- a
standard that must be met under a 1996 telecommunications law for a Bell company
to offer long-distance in its calling region.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They've got a lot of evidence and a lot of support behind this
application,'' said Mel Marten, telecommunications analyst with Edward Jones in
St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
	   SBC asserts its market is open, noting that about 115 of their rivals have
signed up 1.4 million customers in the state. The company also has undergone a
third-party review to ensure that it is properly processing orders from rivals
seeking to switch customers to their service, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   The FCC has 90 days to decide on the application. It must give substantial
weight to an evaluation by the Justice Department. The Texas Public Utility
Commission also will have an opportunity to weigh in.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas regulators already gave their unanimous approval in December to SBC's
plan, with the commission's chairman declaring that the company had opened its
local markets to competitors. That important endorsement will help boost SBC's
proposal at the FCC.
</P>
<P>
	   The company also has agreed to $289 million in penalties if it does not
continue to give its rivals fair access to its systems.
</P>
<P>
	   But some competitors, including MCI WorldCom, which offers local service to
business customers in metropolitan Texas markets, argue that SBC has not passed
the necessary hurdles.
</P>
<P>
	   ``SBC's bid for long-distance authority in Texas is premature. Unlike the
situation in New York, substantial barriers to competition still exist in
Texas,'' the company said in a statement. It called SBC's systems inadequate for
processing orders from competitors.
</P>
<P>
	   AT&AMP;T called SBC ``hostile to competition'' and said the San Antonio-based
company does not provide its competitors with the same level of quality it does
for itself, as required by federal law. AT&AMP;T also has a pending legal challenge
to the FCC's Bell Atlantic decision.
</P>
<P>
	   Southwestern Bell operates SBC's Texas business. SBC phone systems cover
most of the Southwest and Midwest. Its other units include Pacific Bell, Nevada
Bell, and Southern New England Telecommunications Corp. in Connecticut.

<HEADLINE> 'Killer' Bees Attack Kids in Mexico  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ACAPULCO, Mexico (AP) -- A swarm of Africanized ``killer'' bees attacked
students at a primary school in Acapulco on Monday, leaving five children in
serious condition, the Mexican government news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 20 students were stung at the Vicente Guerrero school and taken to
Acapulco's General Hospital, Notimex reported, citing education officials.
</P>
<P>
	   Classes were suspended to allow authorities to destroy the bees. Officials
said high humidity in the aging school building likely attracted the colony.
</P>
<P>
	   Stings from Africanized bees are not more potent than other varieties, but
they are more aggressive and attack in large numbers. They appear very similar
to European bees, although killer bees have a shorter wingspan.

<HEADLINE> Teen Indicted for Columbine Threat  </HEADLINE>
   By P. SOLOMON BANDA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DENVER (AP) -- A federal grand jury on Monday indicted a Florida teen-ager
accused of sending a computer threat that shut down Columbine High School for
two days and Texas man who made unrelated threats in September.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Ian Campbell, 18, of Cape Coral, Fla., faces one count of sending
threatening communication over interstate commerce, said Jeff Dorschner, a
spokesman for the U.S. Attorney. The charge carries a penalty of five years in
prison and a $250,000 fine. He is free on bail and due in court Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Campbell was accused of using the screen name ``Soup 81'' to send an instant
message on Dec. 15 to Columbine sophomore Erin J. Walton, saying he was going to
``finish what begun.''
</P>
<P>
	   According the indictment, Campbell told Walton not to go to school because,
``if you go I don't want your blood on my hands.''
</P>
<P>
	   Columbine students Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold shot and killed 12 students
and a teacher on April 20 before killing themselves in one of the nation's worst
school shootings.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors also said that Arthur Leon Thomas, 18, of Houston, was indicted
on three counts of sending threatening messages. Thomas allegedly sent
threatening letters to Columbine High School and to Jefferson County Sheriff
John Stone, in addition to a threatening e-mail to a Broomfield resident on
Sept. 30, Dorschner said.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas was not in custody Monday.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Immigrants Found in Seattle  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Three illegal immigrants were found dead Monday inside a
soft-topped container that had been shipped from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
	   Fifteen people who survived the journey inside the same container were taken
into the custody of the Immigration and Naturalization Service and were treated
for malnutrition and dehydration. All 18 are believed to be from China.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS had been alerted ``that there were people aboard this boat,''
spokeswoman Irene Mortensen said, but she would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   The boat, the Cape May, is owned by NYK, a company that also owns a ship on
which 25 illegal immigrants huddled in two containers before being arrested upon
arriving in Vancouver, British Columbia, on Jan. 3. That ``doesn't mean the
shipping line is involved in any way,'' Mortensen said.
</P>
<P>
	   The incident in Canada was one of a series in which Chinese immigrants have
hidden in canvas-topped cargo containers to reach West Coast ports. None of
those have had fatalities, however.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month in Long Beach, Calif., 30 illegal immigrants from China who
crossed the Pacific in specially outfitted containers were arrested after the
boxes were unloaded. Twelve people were apprehended Jan. 2 in Seattle, and 14
more on Jan. 4.

<HEADLINE> Confederate Flag Rhetoric Heats Up  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM DAVENPORT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- A South Carolina lawmaker who insulted the NAACP over
the weekend came back with another slap at the civil rights group Monday,
escalating a war of words over the Confederate flag.
</P>
<P>
	   State legislators are expected early this year to consider removing the flag
from atop the Statehouse. And the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People has imposed a tourism boycott on the state, saying the flag is
offensive.
</P>
<P>
	   State Sen. Arthur Ravenel, a Republican and former congressman, speaking to
a pro-flag rally of about 6,000 people Saturday, said lawmakers should not bow
to the ``National Association for Retarded People.''
</P>
<P>
	   Responding to reports about his comments, Ravenel on Monday said he
``apologized to the retarded folks of the world for equating them with the
NAACP.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ravenel, who has a 40-year-old son whom he describes as retarded, said he
misspoke and that while his apology to retarded people was genuine, he owed no
apology to the NAACP.
</P>
<P>
	   Lonnie Randolph, a state NAACP official, said: ``Most of us are smart enough
to know what the organization is and what the organization stands for. We don't
dignify ignorant comments and ignorant statements with a response.''
</P>
<P>
	   Recent public discussion of the flag had already grown fierce.
</P>
<P>
	   During a Friday night presidential debate here, a Republican dinner crowd
booed when George W. Bush was asked his views on the flag, and cheered when he
said it was up to the people of South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   And a black state senator promoted an ad that juxtaposed the Statehouse, the
flag and a hooded member of the Klu Klux Klan in an advertisement that also
upset many state residents.
</P>
<P>
	   While many South Carolinians -- especially blacks -- consider the flag a
racist symbol, Southern heritage groups and other flag supporters say men died
for the banner and it deserves a place above the dome.
</P>
<P>
	   A poll released over the weekend said 57 percent of the 600 South
Carolinians questioned wanted the flag down, and two-thirds favored moving it to
a memorial on the Capitol grounds. The poll, commissioned by the Heritage
Roundtable of Greenville and taken by Clemson University political science
professor Dave Woodard in mid- and late December, had a margin of error of 4
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think a lot of people are dealing with flag fatigue ... and would like
to see it resolved,'' Woodard said.
</P>
<P>
	   As support grows for the flag's removal, flag advocates are likely to
ratchet up the level of rhetoric to get attention, said Bruce Ransom, also of
Clemson University.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That, perhaps, is why we have seen some of the sharp comment,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Trial Opens on Diverted AIDS Funds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN (AP) -- Jury selection began Monday for two more officials of a
defunct AIDS foundation accused of diverting $2.2 million in federal funds for
AIDS patients to political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   Luis Dubon Otero and Dr. Jorge Garib are charged with conspiring to embezzle
federal funds. The money disappeared in the late 1980s and early 1990s from the
San Juan AIDS Institute, where Garib was medical director and Dubon Otero was a
director.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys began questioning prospective jurors Monday morning and continued
well into the evening, focusing on how much they knew about three San Juan AIDS
Institute managers who were convicted in June of funneling federal funds meant
for patients into fake companies. The selection process was to continue Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Former director Yamil Kouri was sentenced to 14 years in prison and ordered
to pay back $1.3 million. Manager Jeannette Sotomayor was sentenced to three
years and 10 months in prison and property manager Armando Borel received a
one-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. Pedro Rossello was expected to testify in the latest trial, as he did
in the trial against the three managers last year. Rossello had taken the stand
to deny charges that Kouri donated $250,000 to his 1992 gubernatorial campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   More than a dozen other people have been indicted in the case.

<HEADLINE> Vegas Wasn't a Bad Bet for New Year  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS (AP) -- New Year's Eve wasn't such a bad bet for Las Vegas resorts.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite concerns that millennium parties and Y2K fears would make the
holiday a bust for resorts, Las Vegas tourism officials say the holiday wasn't
as bad as had been feared in the waning days of 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   The occupancy level for the city's 121,665 hotel rooms was 91.5 percent on
New Year's Eve, higher than the 85 percent that had been projected, according to
Rob Powers, spokesman for the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority.
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Feldman, vice president of public affairs for Mirage Resorts Inc., said
occupancy was 97 percent at the company's four Las Vegas hotel-casinos.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The fact that -- in the face of unparalleled competition from events,
parties and concerts in virtually every major city around the world -- our
hotels were 97 percent occupied at premium rates with some 300,000 people
partying in the streets, that sounds like an unabashed success,'' Feldman said
Monday.

<HEADLINE> No. 2 Pentagon Official Resigns  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John Hamre, the deputy secretary of defense who oversaw
the Pentagon's largely successful inoculations against the Y2K computer bug, is
resigning to become head of a major think tank.
</P>
<P>
	   In announcing the surprise move Monday, Defense Secretary William Cohen said
he had recommended that President Clinton nominate Rudy de Leon to replace
Hamre. De Leon has been the Pentagon's under secretary for personnel and
readiness for the past two years and previously was undersecretary of the Air
Force.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton praised Hamre as ``a respected, decisive and forward-looking
leader.'' He said Hamre had implemented innovative defense management
initiatives and defense contracting reforms. ``His impact in these areas will be
felt long after his departure.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hamre, 49, came to the Pentagon in 1993 as comptroller during the late Les
Aspin's tenure as defense secretary. He held that post until Cohen made him his
top deputy in July 1997, a position Hamre used to push for modernizing the
Pentagon's business practices and improving the security of its computer
systems.
</P>
<P>
	   ``John Hamre has been my friend and partner in running the department,''
Cohen said in a written statement. ``He approaches all issues with extreme
confidence and an extraordinary sense of humor.''
</P>
<P>
	   Hamre took the lead in preparing the Defense Department's far-flung computer
networks for the Y2K rollover. At a cost of $3.6 billion, the effort was
successful except for a temporary New Year's Eve breakdown of a ground station
computer that processes information from a constellation of intelligence
satellites.
</P>
<P>
	   Hamre will leave the Pentagon on March 31 and become president and chief
executive officer of the private Center for Strategic and International Studies,
which ranks among the nation's most prominent public policy research
institutions.
</P>
<P>
	   Like Hamre, de Leon has worked in the Pentagon since the Clinton
administration began.
</P>
<P>
	   Cohen credited de Leon with tackling many of the Pentagon's toughest
problems, including most recently a growing controversy over the way the
services implement the administration's policy on homosexuals in the military.
</P>
<P>
	   De Leon also has been overseeing an Army investigation of allegations that
American troops killed hundreds of South Korean civilians in the opening weeks
of the Korean War in 1950. He also has been at the center of so far unsuccessful
efforts to regain Navy use of the Vieques training range in Puerto Rico.
</P>
<P>
	   De Leon was undersecretary of the Air Force from 1994-97. He was staff
director for the House Armed Services Committee for four years before Aspin
brought him to the Pentagon as a special assistant in 1993.

<HEADLINE> Former Bin Laden Secretary Charged  </HEADLINE>
   By LARRY NEUMEISTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- An American citizen who allegedly once served as personal
secretary to Osama bin Laden was ordered held without bail Monday on charges
that he was part of the conspiracy behind the 1998 embassy bombings in Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   Wadih El Hage, who is from Arlington, Texas, was denied bail after a federal
judge ruled that he poses a danger to society and might flee.
</P>
<P>
	   Bin Laden and El Hage are among 18 people indicted in a conspiracy to attack
Americans in the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The
attacks killed 224 people, including 12 Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald said El Hage returned to Texas in 1997
from a trip abroad and brought with him new terrorism directives from bin
Laden's group that made clear the organization's violent objectives, especially
in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The ultimate results were the bombings which occurred in August 1998,''
Fitzgerald said.
</P>
<P>
	   The evidence cited by Fitzgerald was the closest the government had come
publicly to accusing El Hage of a direct role in the bombings. The prosecutor
said El Hage's role as a communicator in bin Laden's group made it likely that,
if freed on bail, he would try to tell the group the extent of the government's
knowledge of their activities.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Leonard B. Sand also cited a personal experience as he
ruled that El Hage should not be freed on bail.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge noted the day last June when El Hage, angry because he was not
allowed to have a letter read into the record during a hearing, leaped over a
railing and charged toward Sand. He got within several feet before he was
tackled by federal marshals.
</P>
<P>
	   Sam Schmidt, El Hage's lawyer, said prosecutors had failed to cite ``a
single thing'' that showed El Hage posed a danger to society. He said El Hage
offered no resistance as marshals handcuffed him against a wall that day.

<HEADLINE> Analysis of GOP Debate  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- The six Republican presidential candidates, like
the voters they are courting, support tax cuts. So what's the big debate?
</P>
<P>
	   Their third joint meeting in five days turned again and again to taxes,
particularly Texas taxes -- as the underdogs tried to undermine Gov. George W.
Bush and the front-runner sought to separate himself from ``those voices in
Washington.''
</P>
<P>
	   Each scored political points on an issue almost certain to remain at the
core of the six-man contest. ``There are very thin distinctions between us,''
Sen. Orrin Hatch said. ``We're all going to be tax-cutters.''
</P>
<P>
	   Yes, but their motives differ.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush wants to bury the family legacy. His father, former President George
Bush, broke a no-new-tax pledge during his term and many conservatives harbor
doubts about his son because of it. Also, the two-term Texas governor crafted
his $483 billion package to bolster his case as a ``compassionate conservative''
by helping middle-class Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   John McCain, an Arizona senator running as a political reformer, wants to
change the subject from ethics to taxes. He spent last week answering questions
about his work in the Senate on behalf of political contributors. He was happy
to talk taxes; his letter-writing wasn't mentioned at all Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Steve Forbes, a millionaire publisher with enough money to pose a threat to
Bush, used taxes to make a broader point about the front-runner: He called Bush
a typical promise-breaking, word-parsing politician.
</P>
<P>
	   Only Gary Bauer passed on the issue, opting instead to make a broader appeal
to social conservatives.
</P>
<P>
	   `I will say to my party, it better find its voice ... in opposition to
same-sex marriage and in deference to the sanctity of life or it won't matter
how much we want to cut taxes because the country cannot survive another 10
years in the values meltdown it's in right now,'' said the conservative
activist.
</P>
<P>
	   The debate began with Bush being asked about Forbes' latest ad, which
accuses the Texan of breaking a no-new-tax pledge as governor.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush didn't directly answer the question, but he did note that he cut taxes
twice in Texas and is the only candidate with executive office experience. ``I'm
a tax-cutting person,'' he said. ``I know how to get things done.''
</P>
<P>
	   What Bush didn't mention was that he supported a bill that would have raised
sales taxes. The bill never passed, and Bush eventually signed a $1 billion tax
cut package stripped of the increases, but Forbes believes he can exploit the
doubts about the Bush sequel.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes runs the risk of looking too negative, reminding voters of his 1996
ad campaign that damaged eventual nominee Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked in the debate if he would forgo negative ads, Forbes paused while the
audience tittered. The answer is no, he said finally.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If being negative is telling the truth, I will continue telling the
truth,'' said Forbes.
</P>
<P>
	   Replied Bush, ``I'll tell you something, I'll darn sure not do to candidates
what Mr. Forbes did to Bob Dole in 1996.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's tax-cut package is less than half the size of Bush's, but he also
targets middle-class Americans. The difference is in priorities: The Texan would
spend most of future surpluses on tax cuts while McCain would save 60 percent of
the extra money to bolster Social Security.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a growing gap between the haves and have nots,'' McCain said, as
both he and Bush took the traditionally Democratic road to courting middle-class
voters with their tax packages.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes didn't mention his signature flat tax, but worked hard to portray
Bush as evasive.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There was a lot of hedging about the pledge,'' he said. ``Pledges should
not be lightly made.'' Then, in a veiled reference to Bush Sr., Forbes said of
promise-breaking: ``We've been through that before.''

<HEADLINE> Japanese Foreign Car Sales Jump  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Sales of imported autos in Japan rose in 1999 for the first
time in three years, an industry group said Tuesday, adding to evidence that the
world's second-largest economy is emerging from its deepest slump in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Boosted by a 10.2 percent increase in December imports, full-year sales of
foreign-made cars, trucks and buses rose 0.9 percent to 278,225 from 275,869 in
1998, the Japan Auto Importers Association said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The sales growth comes amid mounting signs that record amounts of public
spending and other government stimulus measures are increasing confidence among
Japan's recession-weary consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   The figures showed German brands led by Mercedes Benz remain overwhelming
favorites among Japanese car buyers, accounting for 58.1 percent of the import
market in 1999, up 6.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   General Motors was the best selling U.S. automaker in Japan last year, with
a 5.9 percent share of import sales. Total sales of U.S. imports, including
vehicles made by U.S. subsidiaries of Toyota, Honda and other Japanese
manufacturers, amounted to 19.76 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Big Three are finding the going tough in Japan even as the economy
gets back on the road to growth.
</P>
<P>
	   The most popular U.S. brand in Japan, Chevrolet, recorded a sales increase
of 8.5 percent in December, lagging behind the market average by two percentage
points. Chrysler sales skidded 17.4 percent, while Ford climbed 18.2
percent.

<HEADLINE> Bush Agrees With Rocker Decision  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush, a former major league baseball
team owner, said Monday that Atlanta Braves pitcher John Rocker should be
required to undergo psychological testing over his disparaging comments about
minorities.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I appreciate the fact that the Atlanta Braves are getting him
counseling,'' Bush, the front-runner for the GOP presidential nomination, said
in a debate Monday night in Michigan. ``But ... in athletics, this is a world of
some young men who make a lot of money who don't -- who aren't responsible for
their behavior.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said that as president he would ``usher in the responsibility era, so
that each American, whether you be a baseball player or anything, wear the
uniform of the United States, are responsible for the actions you take in
life,''
</P>
<P>
	   Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig last week ordered Rocker to undergo testing
and said he would await the results before deciding on any disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, Rocker told Sports Illustrated he would never play for a New
York team because he didn't want to ride a train ``next to some queer with
AIDS.'' He also said, ``I'm not a very big fan of foreigners. ... How the hell
did they get in this country?'' He called a black teammate a ``fat monkey,''
mocked the driving skills of Asian women and insulted single mothers.
</P>
<P>
	   Rocker, 25, apologized and said he was not a racist.
</P>
<P>
	   In the debate, Bush, a former managing general partner of the Texas Rangers,
said of Rocker: ``The fellow said some incredibly offensive things. He is a
public person. And I appreciate them trying to get the man help.''

<HEADLINE> Va. Executes Man Who Killed at 17  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Douglas Christopher Thomas was executed by injection
Monday night for killing his girlfriend's parents when he was 17.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas, 26, made no final statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas fatally shot James Baxter Wiseman and Kathy Wiseman as they slept in
their Middlesex home on Nov. 10, 1990. The Wisemans had been trying to end the
relationship between Thomas and their daughter, who was also convicted in the
killing.
</P>
<P>
	   In a telephone interview last week, Thomas said it was unfair that he faced
execution while his girlfriend, convicted as a juvenile for the same crime, was
released years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What I did when I was 17 was wrong, and yes I should be punished. But to
pay the ultimate price while my co-defendant, who is just as guilty as I am, has
been released to go on with a normal life ... is a little extreme.''
</P>
<P>
	   Jessica Wiseman was 14 when she urged Thomas to kill her parents. She was
convicted of murder as a juvenile because she was too young to be tried as an
adult and was released in 1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Thomas' appeal was based on an international agreement that prohibits
executing juveniles. It was signed by the United States, but the Senate has
refused to ratify it.

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Spar Over Taxes  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- Gov. George Bush described himself Monday night
as ``a tax cutting person'' who delivered in Texas and would as president, but
rival Steve Forbes dismissed the Texan's no-new-tax pledges ``as a trinket to
win an election.''
</P>
<P>
	   Taxes were the keynote argument in the third Republican campaign debate in
five days, stirred by Forbes' television ad attacking Bush on grounds he reneged
on a pledge against any tax increases in Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Arizona Sen. John McCain chimed in, saying his tax plan would be ``far
better'' for middle-class Americans. He also said the federal tax cut Bush is
proposing now would spend all the projected budget surplus and $20 billion more,
with two-thirds of the cut going to the wealthiest 10 percent of Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he wants surpluses used to protect Social Security. ``For us to put
all of the surplus into tax cuts, I think, is not a conservative effort,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Disputing the Forbes ad, Bush said he has twice led his state to the biggest
tax cuts in its history. His packages included offsetting increases in sales
taxes, but Bush said the result was lower levies on Texans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am a tax cutting person,'' Bush said. ``I know how to get it done.'' In
last week's GOP debate, Bush promised to cut taxes ``so help me God.''
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes wasn't budging, saying he stood by his ad. ``A pledge should not be
used as a trinket to win an election,'' he said. ``The ad is accurate. ... You
did break that pledge.'' He said things like that make Americans cynical about
politics.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush shot back, ``One thing that makes the American people cynical is
negative advertisements on TV.'' Later, Bush said he would not do to other
candidates what Forbes did to Bob Dole, the GOP nominee in 1996, who emerged
from the primary campaign weakened by Forbes attack ads.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You're not going to win the White House by making pledges that are then
broken,'' Forbes said. ``We've been through that before, particularly on
taxes.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the 1988 presidential campaign, Bush's father made ``read my lips, no new
taxes'' a regular pledge. As president, he accepted tax increases to get a
deficit-cutting budget deal, and the issue was turned against him in his losing
reelection bid in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   The Forbes ad points to a 1994 vow Gov. Bush made while running for
governor, signing a pledge to an anti-tax group that he would ``oppose any
legislation establishing a state personal income tax or increasing the sales
tax.'' Bush in 1997 supported a tax-cut bill that included some sales tax
increases -- an action critics say violated the pledge. The bill didn't pass;
Bush later signed a tax-cut measure into law, saying he supported the earlier
bill in order to move the process along.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Forbes confronted Bush again, this time on abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Let's take a dream ride for a moment,'' he said, ``let's pretend that you
get the nomination.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I accept that premise,'' Bush put in.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes then challenged Bush to promise that as nominee, he would preserve
the anti-abortion plank in the Republican campaign platform, and would promise
to pick a running mate and nominate judges committed to end abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said he would choose a vice president who agrees with his policies and
is qualified to be president, would name federal judges who strictly interpret
the law, and would ``work to keep the Republican Party pro-life.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Vagaries aren't going to work'' Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You may not like the answer, but that's the answer,'' Bush told him.
</P>
<P>
	   Five of the six candidates hedged on an administration plan for aid to
Africa to fight the AIDS epidemic. Sen. Orrin Hatch said he agreed with the $150
million in assistance. Bush, McCain and Forbes said they favored helping, but
only with guarantees that the money would actually go to the people in need, not
to corrupt governments.
</P>
<P>
	   In turn, the GOP candidates, Alan Keyes, Hatch, Gary Bauer, Forbes, McCain
and Bush all declared that Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban boy whose mother
died in escaping to Florida, should not be returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   They also said the boy's father, who wants him returned, should be brought
to the United States to make the decision.
</P>
<P>
	   The 90-minute, nationally televised debate, the third in five days for the
Republicans, was staged at Calvin College in a state Bush calls his
``firewall.'' A victory in Michigan would help him rebound if he gets upset in
earlier primary states.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has made the Feb. 22 Michigan primary one of his top four targets,
along with contests in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jan. 24 Iowa caucuses open this year's election cycle.
</P>
<P>
	   In two debates last week, the candidates also wrestled with competing
tax-cutting philosophies. Bush wants $483 billion in reductions over five years,
with some of the money returned to low- and middle-income Americans to fit his
``compassionate conservative'' slogan.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who plans to flesh out his plans Tuesday, is proposing a $240
billion, five-year package that expands the lowest income tax bracket and
creates tax-free savings accounts for the middle class.
</P>
<P>
	   His plan is smaller than Bush's because he would save 63 percent of future
budget surpluses to finance Social Security. He also would use the surplus on
Medicare and reducing the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes still supports a flat tax, an income tax overhaul he touted in his
failed 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, at a town hall meeting in Holland, Mich., McCain was asked about
the controversy that's been dogging him for nearly a week over letters he has
written in cases involving campaign donors seeking action from federal
regulators.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was doing my job and we're releasing all the letters I've written,''
McCain said. ``But, look, this is a tough business and I understand these things
happen along the way.''
</P>
<P>
	   There was no mention of the issue during the debate.

<HEADLINE> Candidates Make Capsule Suggestions  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Items the Republican presidential candidates would put in a time capsule to
represent the 21st century, as asked during Monday's debate in Michigan:
</P>
<P>
	   GARY BAUER: The first item that always ought to be put in a time capsule,
whatever the century, is the Declaration of Independence, because of the words:
``We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men are created equal,
endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights, among these the right
to liberty and the pursuit of happiness.''
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bush calls himself 'tax-cutting person' in clash with Republican  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) - Gov. George Bush described himself Monday
night as "a tax cutting person" who delivered in Texas and would as president,
but rival Steve Forbes dismissed the Texan's no-new-tax pledges "as a trinket to
win an election."
<P>
	   Taxes were the keynote argument in the third Republican campaign debate in
five days, stirred by Forbes' television ad attacking Bush on grounds he reneged
on a pledge against any tax increases in Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Arizona Sen. John McCain chimed in, saying his tax plan would be "far
better" for middle-class Americans. He also said the federal tax cut Bush is
proposing now would spend all the projected budget surplus and $20 billion more,
with two-thirds of the cut going to the wealthiest 10 percent of Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he wants surpluses used to protect Social Security. "For us to put
all of the surplus into tax cuts, I think, is not a conservative effort," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Disputing the Forbes ad, Bush said he has twice led his state to the biggest
tax cuts in its history. His packages included offsetting increases in sales
taxes, but Bush said the result was lower levies on Texans.
</P>
<P>
	   "I am a tax cutting person," Bush said. "I know how to get it done." In last
week's GOP debate, Bush promised to cut taxes "so help me God."
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes wasn't budging, saying he stood by his ad. "A pledge should not be
used as a trinket to win an election," he said. "The ad is accurate. ... You did
break that pledge." He said things like that make Americans cynical about
politics.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush shot back, "One thing that makes the American people cynical is
negative advertisements on TV." Later, Bush said he would not do to other
candidates what Forbes did to Bob Dole, the GOP nominee in 1996, who emerged
from the primary campaign weakened by Forbes attack ads.
</P>
<P>
	   "You're not going to win the White House by making pledges that are then
broken," Forbes said. "We've been through that before, particularly on taxes."
</P>
<P>
	   In the 1988 presidential campaign, Bush's father made "read my lips, no new
taxes" a regular pledge. As president, he accepted tax increases to get a
deficit-cutting budget deal, and the issue was turned against him in his losing
reelection bid in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   The Forbes ad points to a 1994 vow Gov. Bush made while running for
governor, signing a pledge to an anti-tax group that he would "oppose any
legislation establishing a state personal income tax or increasing the sales
tax." Bush in 1997 supported a tax-cut bill that included some sales tax
increases - an action critics say violated the pledge. The bill didn't pass;
Bush later signed a tax-cut measure into law, saying he supported the earlier
bill in order to move the process along.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Forbes confronted Bush again, this time on abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   "Let's take a dream ride for a moment," he said, "let's pretend that you get
the nomination."
</P>
<P>
	   "I accept that premise," Bush put in.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes then challenged Bush to promise that as nominee, he would preserve
the anti-abortion plank in the Republican campaign platform, and would promise
to pick a running mate and nominate judges committed to end abortion.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush said he would choose a vice president who agrees with his policies and
is qualified to be president, would name federal judges who strictly interpret
the law, and would "work to keep the Republican Party pro-life."
</P>
<P>
	   "Vagaries aren't going to work" Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
	   "You may not like the answer, but that's the answer," Bush told him.
</P>
<P>
	   Five of the six candidates hedged on an administration plan for aid to
Africa to fight the AIDS epidemic. Sen. Orrin Hatch said he agreed with the $150
million in assistance. Bush, McCain and Forbes said they favored helping, but
only with guarantees that the money would actually go to the people in need, not
to corrupt governments.
</P>
<P>
	   In turn, the GOP candidates, Alan Keyes, Hatch, Gary Bauer, Forbes, McCain
and Bush all declared that Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old Cuban boy whose mother
died in escaping to Florida, should not be returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   They also said the boy's father, who wants him returned, should be brought
to the United States to make the decision.
</P>
<P>
	   The 90-minute, nationally televised debate, the third in five days for the
Republicans, was staged at Calvin College in a state Bush calls his "firewall."
A victory in Michigan would help him rebound if he gets upset in earlier primary
states.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain has made the Feb. 22 Michigan primary one of his top four targets,
along with contests in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
	   The Jan. 24 Iowa caucuses open this year's election cycle.
</P>
<P>
	   In two debates last week, the candidates also wrestled with competing
tax-cutting philosophies. Bush wants $483 billion in reductions over five years,
with some of the money returned to low- and middle-income Americans to fit his
"compassionate conservative" slogan.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who plans to flesh out his plans Tuesday, is proposing a $240
billion, five-year package that expands the lowest income tax bracket and
creates tax-free savings accounts for the middle class.
</P>
<P>
	   His plan is smaller than Bush's because he would save 63 percent of future
budget surpluses to finance Social Security. He also would use the surplus on
Medicare and reducing the national debt.
</P>
<P>
	   Forbes still supports a flat tax, an income tax overhaul he touted in his
failed 1996 campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, at a town hall meeting in Holland, Mich., McCain was asked about
the controversy that's been dogging him for nearly a week over letters he has
written in cases involving campaign donors seeking action from federal
regulators.
</P>
<P>
	   "I was doing my job and we're releasing all the letters I've written,"
McCain said. "But, look, this is a tough business and I understand these things
happen along the way."
</P>
<P>
	   There was no mention of the issue during the debate.

<HEADLINE> Fujimori's Ex-Wife Won't Run  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- President Alberto Fujimori's former wife announced Monday
that she would run for Congress, ending supporters' hopes that she would
challenge Fujimori for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
	   But Susana Higuchi said her party, the Independent Moralizing Front, decided
against selecting a presidential candidate as an act of protest against
Fujimori's decision to seek a third consecutive term.
</P>
<P>
	   Higuchi, whose divorce from Fujimori was bitter and highly publicized, had
been touted in recent weeks as a possible presidential or vice presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   The couple's marital problems became public in 1994, after Fujimori's
supporters in Congress passed a law prohibiting the president's immediate family
members from running for national office. Many Peruvians believed the
legislation was tailored to thwart Higuchi's bid to challenge her husband.
</P>
<P>
	   When Higuchi accused Fujimori of tolerating widespread corruption in his
government and ignoring the needs of Peru's poor, he stripped her of her
ceremonial title of first lady, locked her out of the palace and soon after
filed for divorce. The divorce came through in 1996, removing the prohibition
against a Higuchi candidacy.
</P>
<P>
	   Fujimori has a wide lead over his rival candidates in opinion polls.

<HEADLINE> 2000 Auto Sales To Stay in Fast Lane  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DETROIT (AP) -- Automakers will sell perhaps 1 million fewer cars in the
United States in 2000 than they did in the record-setting year of 1999, but that
would be only a slight bump as the industry stays in the fast lane, company
economists said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Most of the (economic) indicators are still flashing green," said Ellen
Hughes-Cromwick, manager of Ford Motor Co.'s corporate economic group.
</P>
<P>
	   Including medium-duty and heavy trucks, automakers sold a record 17.4
million vehicles in the United States last year. According to projections by Ms.
Hughes-Cromwick and her counterparts at DaimlerChrysler AG and General Motors
Corp., that total will fall to between 16 million and 17 million in 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   Factors that could cause sales to drop this year include the possibility of
higher interest rates and households shifting a bigger share of their income
into savings, the economists told a meeting of the Society of Automotive
Analysts during the North American International Auto Show on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Gasoline prices will be "considerably higher" in 2000, said G. Mustafa
Mohatarem, GM's chief economist, who pegged U.S. sales for 2000 at between 16
million and 16.5 million. At the same time, he said, "Cars will be more
affordable in 2000 than they've been in two decades."
</P>
<P>
	   The influence of gas prices on consumers' vehicle choices has declined since
the oil shocks of the mid 1970s, when there was a wider gap between low- and
high-mileage cars, said W. Van Bussmann, chief economist of DaimlerChrysler's
Chrysler Corp. unit.
</P>
<P>
	   Keeping sales from slipping too far below last year's record levels, they
said, will be continued productivity gains driven by technological advances, and
another year of low inflation.
</P>
<P>
	   "U.S. consumers really have enjoyed a golden age," said Bussmann, who
predicted that sales would total about 16.6 million this year.

<HEADLINE> Bradley Still Struggling in Iowa  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa (AP) -- On some hilly stretches of the road from
Indianola to Osceola to Creston, Bill Bradley's bus caravan creeps at 15 mph --
much like the candidate's uphill struggle in Iowa to pull off a surprise against
what Bradley called ``the Gore-istas.''
</P>
<P>
	   Two weeks before voting in the caucuses, Bradley holds out hope for a strong
showing although he has gained little traction in this farm state and remains 20
points behind Democratic presidential rival Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Remember Harry Truman and how they said to him, 'You're never gonna win;
you're never gonna beat that guy Dewey,''' Bradley declares. He says he'll be
happy with 30 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley spent his first days of the new year here preoccupied with damage
control on agriculture and education policy, areas where Vice President Gore has
accused him of neglect.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, he veered sharply onto the offensive, asking Democrats at a Boone
community college if they would help him ``against the Gore-istas.'' Bradley
called the vice president mistaken in his plan to increase defense spending, and
said that ``for Gore to come here and pose as if he's the defender of the family
farm is an insult'' to Iowans.
</P>
<P>
	   He swiped at President Clinton, too.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley told a Milwaukee hockey fan that he voted for the 1996 Freedom to
Farm Act, which is now despised in this farm state, only because Clinton
promised to follow up with safety-net legislation for family farmers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I took his word, which, you know, isn't always the best thing to do,''
Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, he planned to attack Gore's record on tobacco, aides said.
Spokesman Eric Hauser dismissed the ``Gore-istas'' comment as not negative, but
``tongue-in-cheek and whimsical.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's campaign retorted: ``That slip-sliding sound that you hear is the
sound of an increasingly desperate politician,'' said spokesman Chris Lehane.
``It constitutes blatant hypocrisy given his numerous previous statements about
how he's not going to engage in negative politics.''
</P>
<P>
	   Since the vice president has a lock on the party activists who traditionally
dominate Iowa's caucuses, Bradley's challenge is to coax first-timers to the
Jan. 24 caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Crowds for the former senator and basketball star can border on starstruck,
but they also are thin, offering little hope for a big turnout on caucus night.
Where the vice president draws about 500 to high schools and 4-H centers,
Bradley, with his wife, draws closer to half that.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Bradley told could-be supporters at the Crouse Cafe in Indianola,
``On election night, when the caucuses are counted, I want to surprise a lot of
people.''
</P>
<P>
	   He personally keeps count of the pledges voters sign at each stop -- 47 at
the cafe, he reported -- and likes to recall that no insurgent has done better
in the Iowa caucuses than the 31 percent Sen. Edward Kennedy took from winner
Jimmy Carter in 1980.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday alone, Bradley had 15 pages of ``call sheets'' to work through,
telephoning potential caucus goers.
</P>
<P>
	   There is encouragement in the response of such Iowans as retired airline
employee Dottie Lewis of Creston, who said Bradley's flood of straight-talking
TV ads persuaded her to plan to attend a caucus for the first time. ``I've never
been as interested in a candidate before,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Defending his Senate voting record on farm issues is hardly what Bradley
hoped to be doing in January. ``When you're 20 points down it doesn't help,''
said Drake University political science professor Dennis Goldford. But Goldford
suggested the damage may be limited.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know how much of Bradley's support comes from the farm side,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The intensity of Bradley's effort hasn't turned him into a 24-hour grump.
</P>
<P>
	   Sitting on the bus with a diet A&AMP;W vanilla soda propped between his legs,
Bradley said he was tickled the other night when a couple of gals at the
American Legion, where he drank beer straight from the pitcher, coaxed him into
a ``tag dance.'' He was disappointed not to find a karaoke bar in downtown Des
Moines.
</P>
<P>
	   The often-private Bradley also gabbed about his mental health -- no
depression or other mental illness, ``I can certainly tell you that'' -- and his
favorite recent movie -- ``The Green Mile.'' Both those questions were ruled
off-limits when reporters raised them last year.
</P>
<P>
	   An animated storyteller, Bradley spices his stump speech with dramatizations
of a Russian basketball player's elbow jabs.
</P>
<P>
	   But the elbows from Gore on his record and promises put an angry edge into
Bradley's voice.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore ``doesn't have a leg to stand on'' when it comes to farm policy, he
tells reporters. If he sounds negative -- a no-no among voters, according to
surveys -- he says Gore and his camp started it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I didn't open that door, but they did,'' Bradley said. ``I'm certainly not
going to lighten up.''
</P>
<P>
	   By caucus date, Bradley will have spent $1.4 million on television
advertising here, a sum that his campaign manager Gina Glantz said was
equivalent to Gore's Iowa ad expenses.
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore camp, trying to worsen the perception of Bradley's showing,
whatever vote percentage he gets, calls the ad spending evidence Bradley is out
to win.
</P>
<P>
	   This two-day bus swing through Iowa's heavily Republican southwest is
Bradley's 31st trip to the state as a presidential candidate. And yet, by way of
explaining his persistent double-digit deficit to Gore in polls, Bradley says
Iowans still don't know him. A poll last week said 13 percent of registered Iowa
voters were unsure or uncommitted.

$2.7B Sought for Uninsured Kids
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With millions of uninsured children eligible for federal
health programs, President Clinton will ask Congress for $2.7 billion to make it
easier for states and families to sign kids up, officials said today. Vice
President Al Gore planned to highlight the plan tomorrow in Iowa. Health policy,
and how to get insurance to 44 million uninsured Americans, has emerged as the
most significant issue between Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley, who are locked
in a battle for the Democratic presidential nomination.

they slept in their Middlesex home on Nov. 10, 1990. The Wisemans had been
trying to end the relationship between Thomas and their daughter, who was also
convicted in the killing. In a telephone interview last week, Thomas said it was

<HEADLINE> Case-Assignments Scrutinized  </HEADLINE>
   By PETE YOST Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The chief district judge in Washington directed five
prosecutions of Democratic fund-raisers to judges appointed by President
Clinton, bypassing the normal system for randomly assigning cases, records show.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton confidant Vernon Jordan interceded in one case, asking the
sentencing judge to be lenient with the defendant, prominent Miami businessman
Howard Glicken, who has been a fund-raiser for Vice President Gore. Glicken was
sentenced to community service work and probation for two misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Howard Coble, chairman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on courts
and intellectual property, on Monday disclosed the assignment of the cases of
Glicken and another Miami fund-raiser, Mark Jimenez, now a fugitive in the
Justice Department's campaign fund-raising probe.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, who assigned the cases, already
was under scrutiny for specially assigning cases against presidential friend
Webster Hubbell, as well as fund-raisers Charlie Trie, Maria Hsia and Pauline
Kanchanalak.
</P>
<P>
	   Coble, R-N.C., is seeking a judicial inquiry by Johnson's colleagues on the
appeals court and district court into a possible breach of the code of conduct
for federal judges.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Did Chief Judge Johnson abuse her discretion ... and should she have
allowed the normal random case-assignment process to occur?'' Coble asked in a
letter to the appeals court requesting an investigation. Johnson's
administrative assistant, Joe Alexander, had no immediate comment, nor did the
offices of U.S. District judges Henry H. Kennedy Jr. and Emmet Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
	   Johnson assigned the cases to Clinton appointees under the district court's
``special assignment'' policy, which allows the chief judge to bypass the normal
method of randomly assigning cases by computer.
</P>
<P>
	   Regarding an earlier complaint by the conservative group Judicial Watch,
Judge Stephen Williams of the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of
Columbia said the special assignment system was open to abuse. But he accepted
Johnson's explanation that she was simply trying to see that the court's
caseload was handled expeditiously when she assigned the Hubbell and Trie cases.
</P>
<P>
	   Coble asked whether Johnson made Williams aware of the Glicken and Jimenez
cases.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Was Chief Judge Johnson forthcoming with this new information'' about
Glicken and Jimenez? asked Coble. ``One must ask ... how much evidence would be
enough to justify an investigation?''
</P>
<P>
	   Four judges at the courthouse are Republicans and eight are Clinton
appointees. Johnson, the only other Democrat, is a Carter appointee.
</P>
<P>
	   Coble said Johnson ``bypassed the random case-assignment process'' in cases
that were ``potentially embarrassing to the President, the DNC, and Democrats
generally and one case involving President Clinton's close personal friend
Webster Hubbell.''
</P>
<P>
	   Days before Glicken's sentencing, Jordan wrote Kennedy, a 1997 Clinton
appointee, that ``despite his admission of wrongdoing, I am confident I can
state without hesitation that this conduct is not the type of conduct that
characterizes Howard Glicken.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Mr. Glicken ... has been a member of and active participant in the
Democratic party,'' Jordan added. ``I write this letter to ask for leniency.''
</P>
<P>
	   Glicken pleaded guilty to two misdemeanors July 20 in a deal with the
Justice Department's campaign finance task force. Kennedy fined him $80,000, put
him on 18 months probation and ordered him to do 500 hours of community service.
</P>
<P>
	   A court rule permits Johnson to specially assign cases that are
``protracted.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``No rationalization can possibly justify the direct assignment of the
Glicken case,'' Coble wrote. ``There was nothing complicated or protracted about
this case. In fact, his attorney publicly announced ... the day he was charged
with soliciting a $20,000 foreign contribution ... that Mr. Glicken would plead
guilty.''
</P>
<P>
	   Jimenez, of Miami, fled the country last year after being accused of making
illegal contributions to Clinton, Sen. Robert Torricelli of New Jersey and other
Democratic candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Two weeks after the Jimenez case was assigned to Sullivan, it was moved to
Judge Paul Friedman, who also handled the campaign finance cases of Trie,
Kanchanalak and Hsia. Friedman and Sullivan are Clinton appointees.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Why was Judge Sullivan directly assigned this case ... in the first
place?'' asked Coble. ``How is the Jimenez case related to the Trie case?''

<HEADLINE> Protestant Militant Killed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- A gunman killed a prominent Protestant
militant Monday outside his home, raising fears of a renewed bloody feud between
rival pro-British paramilitary groups in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
	   No group claimed responsibility for the attack in the predominantly
Protestant town of Portadown, 30 miles west of Belfast.
</P>
<P>
	   Police and politicians blamed the outlawed Loyalist Volunteer Force for
gunning down Richard Jameson, who was the reputed local commander of the rival
Ulster Volunteer Force.
</P>
<P>
	   Jameson, 46, died after being shot point-blank in the head as he drove into
his driveway. The lone gunman escaped in a waiting car, police said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The people of Northern Ireland thought they had left these dark days
behind,'' said Portadown's leading Catholic politician, Brid Rodgers, who is a
Cabinet minister in Northern Ireland's new Protestant-Catholic government formed
last month.
</P>
<P>
	   The LVF was founded in 1996 by hard-line UVF members who were opposed to
observing a cease-fire in support of Northern Ireland's peace process.
</P>
<P>
	   The LVF tried to upset peacemaking efforts by killing Catholic civilians at
random, but called its own truce two years ago after its commander, Billy ``King
Rat'' Wright, was assassinated in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The convicted members of both groups have been winning early paroles under
terms of the Good Friday peace accord of 1998. All are supposed to be free by
July.
</P>
<P>
	   But both gangs continue to operate competing criminal rackets in
working-class Protestant towns like Portadown, where tensions between the two
armed camps run particularly high.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, rival UVF and LVF mobs staged a vicious pub brawl after a soccer
game in the town. Jameson was among the dozen people hospitalized with injuries
following that fracas.
</P>
<P>
	   David Ervine, spokesman for the UVF-linked Progressive Unionist Party, said
he knew Jameson personally. Ervine said he'd been targeted by the Loyalist
Volunteers because of his efforts to get them to stop dealing illegal drugs in
the Portadown area.

<HEADLINE> Idaho Postpones Legislative Session  </HEADLINE>
   By MARK WARBIS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- Idaho postponed the start of its 2000 legislative
session Monday after the senate president pro tem died of a heart attack while
taking his regular morning jog.
</P>
<P>
	   The death of Jerry Twiggs led the House and Senate to convene only briefly
at midday before adjourning until Jan. 17.
</P>
<P>
	   Republican Gov. Dirk Kempthorne sent letters to both houses reporting that
``the condition of the state is sound'' but postponed his State of the State
address for a week.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's a sadness that hangs over this state Capitol now,'' the governor
said after meeting with Twiggs' widow, Sandra.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is not how folks thought we'd start the new millennium. But maybe
it's the mark of Idaho, the good people of Idaho that we will take this loss, we
will shoulder it, we will pray together, but we will move forward,'' Kempthorne
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Twiggs, 66, was a retired Blackfoot farmer in his eighth term in the Senate
and fourth as the chamber's president pro tem.
</P>
<P>
	   It was the second senior loss for the Legislature in three weeks. The dean
of the Legislature, Jim Stoicheff, died from a heart attack at home a week
before Christmas.

<HEADLINE> With two weeks to go, Bradley still struggling uphill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa (AP) - On some hilly stretches of the road from
Indianola to Osceola to Creston, Bill Bradley's bus caravan creeps at 15 mph -
much like the candidate's uphill struggle in Iowa to pull off a surprise against
what Bradley called "the Gore-istas."
<P>
	   Two weeks before voting in the caucuses, Bradley holds out hope for a strong
showing although he has gained little traction in this farm state and remains 20
points behind Democratic presidential rival Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   "Remember Harry Truman and how they said to him, 'You're never gonna win;
you're never gonna beat that guy Dewey,"' Bradley declares. He says he'll be
happy with 30 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley spent his first days of the new year here preoccupied with damage
control on agriculture and education policy, areas where Vice President Gore has
accused him of neglect.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, he veered sharply onto the offensive, asking Democrats at a Boone
community college if they would help him "against the Gore-istas." Bradley
called the vice president mistaken in his plan to increase defense spending, and
said that "for Gore to come here and pose as if he's the defender of the family
farm is an insult" to Iowans.
</P>
<P>
	   He swiped at President Clinton, too.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley told a Milwaukee hockey fan that he voted for the 1996 Freedom to
Farm Act, which is now despised in this farm state, only because Clinton
promised to follow up with safety-net legislation for family farmers.
</P>
<P>
	   "I took his word, which, you know, isn't always the best thing to do,"
Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, he planned to attack Gore's record on tobacco, aides said.
Spokesman Eric Hauser dismissed the "Gore-istas" comment as not negative, but
"tongue-in-cheek and whimsical."
</P>
<P>
	   Gore's campaign retorted: "That slip-sliding sound that you hear is the
sound of an increasingly desperate politician," said spokesman Chris Lehane. "It
constitutes blatant hypocrisy given his numerous previous statements about how
he's not going to engage in negative politics."
</P>
<P>
	   Since the vice president has a lock on the party activists who traditionally
dominate Iowa's caucuses, Bradley's challenge is to coax first-timers to the
Jan. 24 caucuses.
</P>
<P>
	   Crowds for the former senator and basketball star can border on starstruck,
but they also are thin, offering little hope for a big turnout on caucus night.
Where the vice president draws about 500 to high schools and 4-H centers,
Bradley, with his wife, draws closer to half that.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Bradley told could-be supporters at the Crouse Cafe in Indianola, "On
election night, when the caucuses are counted, I want to surprise a lot of
people."
</P>
<P>
	   He personally keeps count of the pledges voters sign at each stop - 47 at
the cafe, he reported - and likes to recall that no insurgent has done better in
the Iowa caucuses than the 31 percent Sen. Edward Kennedy took from winner Jimmy
Carter in 1980.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday alone, Bradley had 15 pages of "call sheets" to work through,
telephoning potential caucus goers.
</P>
<P>
	   There is encouragement in the response of such Iowans as retired airline
employee Dottie Lewis of Creston, who said Bradley's flood of straight-talking
TV ads persuaded her to plan to attend a caucus for the first time. "I've never
been as interested in a candidate before," she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Defending his Senate voting record on farm issues is hardly what Bradley
hoped to be doing in January. "When you're 20 points down it doesn't help," said
Drake University political science professor Dennis Goldford. But Goldford
suggested the damage may be limited.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't know how much of Bradley's support comes from the farm side," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The intensity of Bradley's effort hasn't turned him into a 24-hour grump.
</P>
<P>
	   Sitting on the bus with a diet A&AMP;W vanilla soda propped between his legs,
Bradley said he was tickled the other night when a couple of gals at the
American Legion, where he drank beer straight from the pitcher, coaxed him into
a "tag dance." He was disappointed not to find a karaoke bar in downtown Des
Moines.
</P>
<P>
	   The often-private Bradley also gabbed about his mental health - no
depression or other mental illness, "I can certainly tell you that" - and his
favorite recent movie - "The Green Mile." Both those questions were ruled
off-limits when reporters raised them last year.
</P>
<P>
	   An animated storyteller, Bradley spices his stump speech with dramatizations
of a Russian basketball player's elbow jabs.
</P>
<P>
	   But the elbows from Gore on his record and promises put an angry edge into
Bradley's voice.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore "doesn't have a leg to stand on" when it comes to farm policy, he tells
reporters. If he sounds negative - a no-no among voters, according to surveys -
he says Gore and his camp started it.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't open that door, but they did," Bradley said. "I'm certainly not
going to lighten up."
</P>
<P>
	   By caucus date, Bradley will have spent $1.4 million on television
advertising here, a sum that his campaign manager Gina Glantz said was
equivalent to Gore's Iowa ad expenses.
</P>
<P>
	   The Gore camp, trying to worsen the perception of Bradley's showing,
whatever vote percentage he gets, calls the ad spending evidence Bradley is out
to win.
</P>
<P>
	   This two-day bus swing through Iowa's heavily Republican southwest is
Bradley's 31st trip to the state as a presidential candidate. And yet, by way of
explaining his persistent double-digit deficit to Gore in polls, Bradley says
Iowans still don't know him. A poll last week said 13 percent of registered Iowa
voters were unsure or uncommitted.

<HEADLINE> Burger King President Resigns  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MIAMI (AP) -- The president of Burger King's North American division, Paul
Clayton, said Monday he resigned to become chief executive officer of The Jamba
Juice Co.
</P>
<P>
	   Jamba Juice is a San Francisco-based business with 275 stores serving up a
wide variety of icy, all natural fruit smoothies and juices, as well as warm
soups and bread.
</P>
<P>
	   Clayton, 41, said the switch from flame-broiled beef to frozen drinks isn't
linked to recent bad press over the Miami-based burger giant's Pokemon
giveaways.
</P>
<P>
	   "My decision was based on the fact that they have a terrific brand, a rich
culture, a terrific product and a rich future," said Clayton, who will start his
new job Feb. 7 after 16 years with Burger King and three years as president. "I
look forward to being a part of their development process."
</P>
<P>
	   In November, Burger Kings across the nation ran out of the wildly popular
Pokemon toys and cards after children and parents gobbled up kids meals to get
the prizes inside.
</P>
<P>
	   Then, a 13-month-old Sonora, Calif., girl suffocated on a plastic ball that
holds the toys on Dec. 11. Federal officials accused the fast-food giant of
being too slow in recalling the millions of containers.
</P>
<P>
	   Clayton said Burger King did everything necessary to protect its customers.

	   Higuchi, whose divorce from Fujimori was bitter and highly publicized, had
been touted in recent weeks as a possible presidential or vice presidential
candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   The couple's marital problems became public in 1994, after Fujimori's
supporters in Congress passed a law prohibiting the president's immediate family
members from running for national office. Many Peruvians believed the
legislation was tailored to thwart Higuchi's bid to challenge her husband.
</P>
<P>
	   When Higuchi accused Fujimori of tolerating widespread corruption in his
government and ignoring the needs of Peru's poor, he stripped her of her
ceremonial title of first lady, locked her out of the palace and soon after
filed for divorce. The divorce came through in 1996, removing the prohibition
against a Higuchi candidacy.
</P>
<P>
	   Fujimori has a wide lead over his rival candidates in opinion polls.

<HEADLINE> 100,000 Israelis Protest Syria Deal  </HEADLINE>
   By MARK LAVIE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- More than 100,000 Israelis, many waving huge maps
and banners, gathered in the drizzle Monday to demonstrate against the price
Israel would likely pay for peace with Syria -- return of the strategic Golan
Heights.
</P>
<P>
	   As Prime Minister Ehud Barak prepared to leave Shepherdstown, W.Va., after
the second round of Israel-Syria talks, leaders of the 17,000 Israelis who live
on the Golan Heights welcomed their supporters in the square in front of Tel
Aviv city hall.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will never leave the Golan Heights,'' declared Eli Malka, chairman of
the Golan Residents Committee, setting off cheers from the demonstrators.
Filling most of the square, they held banners and signs aloft with messages
including, ``The people are with the Golan'' and ``We will not leave the
Golan.''
</P>
<P>
	   The slogans appeared on stickers, hats and buttons in Hebrew and in Russian
-- an attempt to reach the tens of thousands of recent immigrants from the
former Soviet Union who could be crucial in a planned referendum on the Golan's
fate.
</P>
<P>
	   A huge 3-D map depicted the Golan and its settlements, and a two-story high
balloon declared, ``We will not descend from the Golan.''
</P>
<P>
	   Many of the protesters were teen-agers who were bused in. Before the protest
began, they sang nationalist songs.
</P>
<P>
	   Former Gen. Meir Dagan, just retired from his position as the government's
adviser on terrorism, warned that a Golan pullout would bring ''100 years of
terrorism'' into Israel.
</P>
<P>
	   In response to Barak's claim that failure to make peace would result in a
war, Dagan told the crowd, ``If we give back the Golan, there will also be a
war, and it will be bloodier and costlier than any other war in our history.''
</P>
<P>
	   Returning from the Shepherdstown talks Monday, Foreign Minister David Levy
said no progress was made.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is no drawing of borders and there are no agreements,'' David Levy
told reporters. ``We can certainly not speak of results,'' he said, adding that
closing gaps between the two sides ``will have to wait for the next round.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Freishtat brought his 11-year-old son with him from Jerusalem to
demonstrate against concessions to Syria.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They are not to be trusted with a peace treaty,'' said Freishtat, who
moved here 14 years ago from Silver Spring, Md. Syria is a dictatorship and
shows no signs of change, he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Farmer Yehoshua Weil, 52, faces eviction from the collective village of
Ramot if Israel gives up the Golan Heights. He sees the issue as more than a
matter of real estate. ``It's our home,'' he said, ``but it also appears to be a
change in the nation's values, that settlement is losing its importance.''
</P>
<P>
	   Although the turnout was impressive, organizers failed to produce what they
promised -- the largest demonstration in Israel's history -- reflecting a rift
between Golan Heights settlers and those from the West Bank. The record is
widely believed to be a demonstration against the war in Lebanon in 1982 that
drew between 300,000 and 400,000 protesters.
</P>
<P>
	   The lower-than-expected turnout might also have reflected a recent rift
between Golan Heights settlers and those from the West Bank. After joining
forces at one point, Golan settlement leaders had second thoughts. West Bank
settler leaders were not prominent at the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
	   Chaim Saperia, head of the Public Council for the Golan, said the joint
approach was a ``bad mistake.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said the Golan settlers must appeal to Israel's moderates, while the West
Bank settlers are identified with hawkish ideologues. He said it was essential
to break the link to maximize support among Israelis, though the well-organized
West Bank settlers could have brought in thousands more demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak has pledged to put any agreement with Syria before the people in a
referendum.

<HEADLINE> Bucks 137, Hornets 87  </HEADLINE>
    By GREG BEACHAM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Ray Allen scored 26 points to lead the Bucks' fearsome
offensive attack as Milwaukee trounced Charlotte 137-87 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The defeat was the worst in franchise history for the Hornets, who lost
their sixth straight game with a listless performance in the final game of a
six-game road trip.
</P>
<P>
	   The red-hot Bucks set a franchise record with 13 3-pointers while shooting
64 percent from the floor, including 57 percent on 3-pointers. All 10 Bucks who
played scored at least eight points, and eight finished in double figures.
</P>
<P>
	   Milwaukee won its sixth straight home game for the club's longest home
winning streak since February 1992. The Bucks, who won a double-overtime
thriller against the Wizards two nights ago, got an easy warmup for Wednesday's
showdown with the Los Angeles Lakers.
</P>
<P>
	   Allen, who is expected to be among the three players who will be named
Tuesday to the U.S. Olympic team, was 10-for-16 from the field and had eight
assists. He helped the Bucks get a 22-point lead at halftime which they expanded
to 100-66 after three.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bucks pounded the Hornets with a barrage of outside shooting that
included a season-high 18 points from Tim Thomas, who hit six 3-pointers. Glenn
Robinson, who celebrated his 27th birthday, had 13 points, while Sam Cassell
added 18 points and 12 assists.
</P>
<P>
	   Charlotte hasn't won since beating Milwaukee on Dec. 29. Anthony Mason and
Derrick Coleman had six points apiece and didn't seem interested in the guarding
the Bucks' outside shooters, while Eddie Jones missed his 10th straight game
with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
	   Milwaukee built a 22-point lead in the first half by shooting 60 percent.
Thomas was perfect on four 3-point attempts as the game got out of hand in the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   The onslaught continued after halftime, as the Bucks scored 19 points in the
first six minutes of the third quarter to take an 88-58 lead. Only the shooting
of David Wesley, who had 23 points for Charlotte, kept the game from getting
ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
	   But in the fourth quarter, with Wesley on the bench, the Hornets collapsed.
Milwaukee went on a 24-2 run to open the quarter as Robert Traylor and Haywoode
Workman combined for 19 points.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An Italian man pleaded innocent Monday to a federal
charge that he kidnapped his 2-year-old daughter from Southern California and
took her to Rome, where her mother was killed during an argument when she went
to retrieve the child.
</P>
<P>
	   Carlo Alberto Ventre, 51, entered a plea to a count of international
parental kidnapping. His Los Angeles trial was scheduled to begin on Feb. 29. He
could face up to three years in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   Ventre has been ordered to stay at his brother's home in Las Vegas under
electronic monitoring pending trial.
</P>
<P>
	   A grand jury on Wednesday indicted Ventre on charges of allegedly taking his
daughter, Santina, to Italy in January 1998. Her mother, Toni Dykstra, had sole
custody.
</P>
<P>
	   Dykstra, 29, went to Italy to retrieve Santina and died of a blow to the
head during an argument with Ventre on July 28, 1998. Ventre, who claimed
self-defense, has not been charged in Italy in connection with the death.
</P>
<P>
	   Santina, now 4, was brought back to Southern California in November and has
been living with her maternal grandparents.
</P>
<P>
	   Ventre was arrested in the kidnapping case when he arrived in Los Angeles on
Dec. 19 on a flight from Milan.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Protesters Fall Silent  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA, Cuba (AP) -- Thousands of protesters demanding the return of
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez fell silent Monday upon hearing the announcement that
an American judge had ordered the boy to stay in the United States until at
least March.
</P>
<P>
	   The demonstrators had gathered for the latest in a monthlong string of
rallies lobbying for Elian to be returned from Miami to Cuba and be reunited
with his father. Many looked stunned when Hassan Perez, head of student group
tied to the government, announced the decision that had come that day in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   The order issued by Miami-Dade County Circuit Judge Rosa Rodriguez was
``illegal and arbitrary,'' charged Perez, president of the government's
Federation of University Students.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Who are these beasts?'' asked Perez, referring to Cuban exiles in Miami
who he said would use ``all of their resources to impede the child's return.''
</P>
<P>
	   Perez ended his comments to the applause of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
	   The temporary protective order -- issued Monday in defiance of a federal
government order that Elian be returned to Cuba by Friday -- sets a March 6
hearing for Rodriguez to hear arguments by Elian's Miami relatives seeking to
keep him in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found Thanksgiving Day clinging to an innertube off Florida's
coast. His mother was lost at sea in the apparent attempt to emigrate illegally
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   By the time the news was being announced in Miami late Monday afternoon,
thousands were already crowding around the U.S. Interests Section on Havana's
main coastal highway for the pro-Elian rally announced in the morning.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the idea is absurd,'' Cuban protester Leonil Feliu said of the
judge's ruling. ``What they are doing is prolonging the process. They know at
the end of the day that they have to bring him to Cuba, all they are doing is
lengthening the inevitable.''

<HEADLINE> Evidence of Europa Ocean Exists  </HEADLINE>
    By MATTHEW FORDAHL AP Science Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- New evidence from NASA's Galileo spacecraft bolsters
theories that a liquid ocean lies beneath the crust of Jupiter's moon Europa,
scientists reported Monday after analyzing results from the probe's latest
flyby.
</P>
<P>
	   The findings indirectly support the case for life beneath the moon's icy
crust. Some experts believe primitive organisms could survive just as they do
deep in the Earth's ocean near volcanic vents.
</P>
<P>
	   "Certainly if you are going to look for other environments where life might
form or be able to survive, this might be a good one," said Torrence Johnson,
Galileo's project scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
	   Galileo took measurements of Europa's magnetic field during a Jan. 3 flyby
218 miles above the moon. Researchers hoped to see if the moon's magnetic north
pole had changed since previous encounters.
</P>
<P>
	   The magnetic north pole did indeed reverse and appears to do so about every
5 1/2 hours, something that would make a compass difficult to use. An
underground layer of conductive liquid -- like saltwater -- best explains the
magnetic flip-flop, scientists said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think these findings tell us that there is indeed a layer of liquid water
beneath Europa's surface," said Margaret Kivelson, a spacecraft scientist. "This
new evidence certainly makes the argument for the presence of an ocean far more
persuasive."
</P>
<P>
	   Images from previous Galileo encounters as well as the Voyager spacecraft
had strongly suggested an ocean exists beneath the smooth, reflective surface.
But researchers could not be certain that it still existed, if it ever did.
</P>
<P>
	   "All the geological evidence relates to the period during which those
geologic features formed," Johnson said. "Most geologists feel it's very recent,
but there are some other people in the field who say the surface could be up to
500 million years old."
</P>
<P>
	   The latest findings are particularly important because they suggest liquid
water is still present beneath the surface.
</P>
<P>
	   "The universe and the solar system are actually swimming in water, but most
of it's frozen," Johnson said. "Liquid water is what's important to the
biologist -- liquid water and a source of energy."
</P>
<P>
	   Galileo, which arrived at Jupiter in 1995, is not scheduled to make any more
encounters of Europa. Another spacecraft, the Europa Orbiter, is currently being
developed for launch in 2003. It would start circling the moon in 2008.

   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) -- Railway workers began a strike to press for higher
wages Monday, stopping all international travel and significantly slowing
domestic transport, officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result of the 60-hour walkout, which began at midnight Sunday, only 455

of the Hungarian State Railways has refused to consider more than 8.5 percent,
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the strike, talks between the unions and the representatives of the
state resumed Monday afternoon. Union officials had said they were willing to
stop the strike immediately if an agreement was reached.

<HEADLINE> $2.7B Sought for Health Programs  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With millions of uninsured children eligible for federal
health programs, President Clinton will ask Congress for $2.7 billion to make it
easier for states and families to sign kids up, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore planned to highlight the plan Tuesday in Iowa. Health
policy, and how to get insurance to 44 million uninsured Americans, has emerged
as the most significant debate between Gore and former Sen. Bill Bradley, who
are locked in a battle for the Democratic presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore also will publicize a new report that finds enrollment in the
Children's Health Insurance Program has doubled in the last year to about 2
million children. Clinton signed CHIP, as the program is called, into law in
1997.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're really encouraged with the trend,'' Chris Jennings, Clinton's health
policy adviser, said Monday. ``The president feels that these numbers bode well
for the future. But he also feels strongly that we need to provide additional
tools for states to enroll kids and to eliminate barriers that have limited
coverage.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's plan would make it easier for children in the federal school lunch
program to enroll in health programs and would allow child-care centers,
homeless shelters and other offices to immediately enroll children. It also
would require many states to simplify Medicaid application forms and let more
19- and 20-year-olds into the programs.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan would cost $2.7 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
	   There are 11 million uninsured children in the United States, although more
than a third are eligible for Medicaid or for CHIP, which helps children whose
families earn too much for Medicaid but not enough to buy insurance on their
own.
</P>
<P>
	   The initiative, a part of Clinton's budget request to Congress for 2001,
would build on these existing programs. It's much like Gore's plan, and many of
the details are virtually identical.
</P>
<P>
	   Specifically, the new budget proposal would:
</P>
<P>
	   --Allow school lunch programs, which also serve low-income children, to
share information with Medicaid officials. A recent study found that almost 4
million uninsured children are in the lunch program, making it a prime place to
find them.
</P>
<P>
	   --Allow child care centers, homeless shelters and welfare offices to enroll
kids right away while their applications for health coverage are being
processed.
</P>
<P>
	   --Require states that have simple CHIP applications also use simpler
applications for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
	   Going further, Gore also would allow more people into CHIP, including
children in families with higher incomes and some parents. The White House is
considering making a similar budget request, but no decision has been made, a
White House official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley take an altogether different approach. He would scrap Medicaid and
CHIP and give poor families subsidies to buy coverage through the federal
workers' insurance plan.
</P>
<P>
	   Medicaid, which provides free health insurance for the poor, traditionally
has had trouble attracting all who qualify for it. Many parents don't even know
about it. Some who do see it as a welfare program and want to avoid what they
consider the embarrassment of accepting welfare. And many states have
complicated application forms or limited hours of service, which make signing up
difficult.
</P>
<P>
	   Those problems are highlighted in a report being released this week by the
Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured. The study of 1,335 low-income
parents found that two-thirds with eligible but uninsured children have tried to
enroll their children but couldn't. More than half gave up because of the
difficulty of the process or were denied coverage.
</P>
<P>
	   The new children's health program seeks to avoid many of those pitfalls with
simpler applications, friendly program names and cost-sharing, where families
pay a small part of the premium and avoid the welfare stigma.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of uninsured children rose in 1998, and CHIP enrolled only about
1 million kids in its first year. That left policy-makers wondering if that
program will suffer from similar problems. With the second year's enrollment
doubled, the White House is celebrating, and Gore, no doubt, will be too.
</P>
<P>
	   The new report notes that states are letting more children into the program
than the first year. Federal law allows into the program children whose
families' incomes are below 200 percent of the federal poverty level, or about
$33,000 for a family of four. Some states set the limit lower.
</P>
<P>
	   In March 1997, just four states covered youngsters up to 200 percent of
poverty. Today, 30 states are doing so or plan to.

</P>
<P>
	   Coretta Brown's 3-pointer with 1:17 left got North Carolina within 56-52.

<P>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Lamond Murray scored 20 points against his former team and
Brevin Knight had 14 assists and hit some big free throws Monday night as the
Cleveland Cavaliers won their third straight, 111-106 over the Los Angeles
Clippers.
</P>
<P>
	   Bob Sura added 20 points, rookie Andre Miller had 18 and Knight made seven
free throws in the final 2:16 for Cleveland, which needed to rally to win its
eighth straight over Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
	   Derek Anderson, traded by the Cavs to Los Angeles for Murrray, led the
Clippers with 29 points. Rookie Lamar Odom had 28 before fouling out with 6:06
remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cavs, who recently dropped 10 of 11, wanted to win before heading out on
a seven-game, 12-day West Coast road trip. This one was tougher than it should
have been, and if not for Miller providing an offensive spark in the third
quarter, the Clippers might have pulled away.
</P>
<P>
	   Shawn Kemp, bothered by a sprained foot, scored 17 points on 6-of-14 for
Cleveland, which made 12 straight free throws in the fourth quarter before
Knight missed the first of two with 23 seconds left and the Cavs up two.
</P>
<P>
	   Knight made the second, and after Troy Hudson's basket brought the Clippers
within one, Knight made two more to make it 109-106.
</P>
<P>
	   Clippers coach Chris Ford wanted his team to look for a 3-pointer, but
Hudson drove to the basket and missed a lay-in. Sura then made two more free
throws to close it out.
</P>
<P>
	   Troy Nesby had 15 points and Hudson 14 for the Clippers, who made 10 of 18
3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
	   Los Angeles' outside shooting enabled the Clippers to take an eight-point
lead into the fourth and Cavs coach Randy Wittman decided to play both point
guards -- Miller and Knight -- together for one of the first times all year.
</P>
<P>
	   Millers' 3 from the wing ignited an 11-2 run that gave the Cavs a 90-89 lead
with 8:17 remaining, but Cleveland went five possessions without scoring and the
Clippers tied it again on Nesby's 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
	   However, with Odom on the bench, the Clippers struggled to score and when
they didn't they were forced to foul.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cavs finished 29 of 39 from the line, including 20 of 24 in the second
half.
</P>
<P>
	   Anderson, who had a 4-point play and spectacular layup earlier in the
quarter, went 5-for-5 from the floor and Los Angeles shot 74 percent as a team
in scoring 38 points in the third period to take an 85-77 lead.

    ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) -- Stephon Marbury scored 22 points and Keith Van Horn
added 20 points and 10 rebounds as the New Jersey Nets won for the 12th time in
their its last 17 games, 100-94 over the Orlando Magic on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Nets led 98-87 with 2:29 remaining but Orlando's Darrell Armstrong
scored six consecutive points to pull Orlando within five. Bo Outlaw made one of
two free throws to make it 98-94 with 44.8 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey's Johnny Newman then turned the ball over and the Magic had a
chance to cut it to two points, but Kendall Gill blocked a layup attempt by
Monty Williams with 31 seconds remaining. Gill soared above the rim to block the
shot, drawing protests from the Magic that the ball already was in the cylinder.
</P>
<P>
	   Gill and Lucious Harris combined for two of four free throws in the game's
final 6.9 seconds to finish the scoring.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong led all scorers with 29 points and had eight assists. Outlaw came
off the bench to add 16 points 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Marbury added nine assists and Jamie Feick had 13 rebounds for New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
	   Outlaw's layup pulled Orlando 92-87 but Van Horn and Harris answered with
consecutive 3-pointers to put New Jersey ahead 98-87.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey led by as many as 13 points early in the fourth quarter but
Orlando cut it to 88-84 with an 11-2 run that was capped by a Ben Wallace layup
at the 5:19 mark.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey wasted little time closing Orlando's six-point halftime lead by
starting the third quarter on a 20-6 run. New Jersey led 69-61 at the 5:48 mark
and outscored the Magic 31-15 in the quarter. Van Horn and Marbury each scored
eight points in the period.
</P>
<P>
	   Armstrong scored 15 points and Wallace had 10 points and 11 rebounds as the
Magic led 55-49 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
	   New Jersey led 36-32 with 8:34 remaining in the half but Orlando finished on
a 23-13 run. The Nets were led by Marbury and Burrell with 10 points each.

<HEADLINE> Islanders 2, Coyotes 2, tie  </HEADLINE>
    By IRA PODELL AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   UNIONDALE, N.Y. (AP) -- Bill Muckalt scored early in the third period Monday
night to rally the New York Islanders to a 2-2 tie with the Phoenix Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
	   Muckalt skated down right wing and cut across the slot. His back-hander was
stopped, but the rebound came right back to Muckalt, who scored his eighth goal
at 5:59.
</P>
<P>
	   Sean Burke started his second straight game in goal for Phoenix after
missing 16 contests with a torn thumb ligament. He stopped two point-blank
attempts with 4:30 left in regulation to preserve the draw.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither team has lost this season in overtime. Burke and Kevin Weekes each
turned aside scoring opportunities in the extra session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Islanders drew their only power play with 41 seconds left in overtime,
creating a 4-on-3 advantage, but couldn't convert.
</P>
<P>
	   New York held a 37-32 shots advantage against Phoenix, which completed a
road trip 1-2-1. The Coyotes lead the NHL with 27 road points.
</P>
<P>
	   Deron Quint scored his fifth goal 1:48 into the third period to give the
Coyotes their only lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Quint took a pass from Rick Tocchet, skated to the center of the blue line
and whistled a shot over Weekes' right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
	   Brad Isbister gave New York a 1-0 with a penalty-shot goal in the first
after being pulled down by Keith Carney on a breakaway,
</P>
<P>
	   On the penalty shot, Isbister, playing in his first game against his former
team, skated in to the left of Burke, deked to his backhand and lifted a shot
over the goalie's pad for his 13th goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Isbister, who had an earlier goal waived off when he was called for a
penalty, was traded to the Islanders last March 20.
</P>
<P>
	   It was New York's first penalty shot since Mariusz Czerkawski was stopped at
Washington at Dec. 4, 1998. The last successful Islanders penalty shot was when
Tom Chorske beat Colorado's Patrick Roy on March 7, 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Burke faced a penalty shot for the second time this season. He denied St.
Louis' Terry Yake on Nov. 18 while with the Florida Panthers.
</P>
<P>
	   There have been six goals on 20 NHL penalty shots this season.
</P>
<P>
	   Jyrki Lumme tied it at 1-all 4:36 into the second with his sixth. Jamie
Heward's clearing attempt went right to Lumme just inside the blue line and he
ripped a shot past Weekes.
</P>
<P>
	   Tim Connolly, the Islanders first-round pick -- fifth overall -- in last
year's draft, was a healthy scratch. The 18-year-old center -- the NHL's
youngest player -- played in New York's first 39 games.

Dangerous Public Water Supplies Found in Newfoundland
</P>
<P>
	   ST. JOHN'S, Newfoundland (AP) -- About a third of 197 public water supplies
tested in Newfoundland since 1985 contained high levels of potentially dangerous
chemicals, the province revealed Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Studies have shown consuming water containing high levels of these
chemicals, known as trihalomethanes or THMs, increases the risk of contracting
bladder cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   THMs are among the many by-products created when chlorine is used to
disinfect drinking water.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People should not be alarmed about THMs in their water supplies,''
Environment Minister Oliver Langdon said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The benefits of disinfecting drinking water is greater than the risk on
health from THMs. . . . It's not a crisis situation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the minister said the province would hire a full-time employee to
work with municipalities to help them reduce their THM levels. A new Web site
and brochures are also being put together.
</P>
<P>
	   Sixty-three of the communities tested had unacceptable levels of THM,
prompting some of them to take matters into their own hands.

Natural Resources Minister To Meet With Striking Miners
</P>
<P>
	   POINT ACONI, Nova Scotia (AP) -- Federal Natural Resources Minister Ralph
Goodale did an about-face Monday and agreed to meet with union representatives
for hundreds of illegally striking Cape Breton coal miners.
</P>
<P>
	   But that didn't end the wildcat action at federally owned Devco, or bring 10
or so miners holed up at the bottom of Cape Breton's last working coal mine back
to the surface.
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Noble, a spokesman for the miners, said they want more than just talk.
</P>
<P>
	   He said they won't give up until they see movement from the federal
government on their demand for negotiations on improved severance and retirement
packages for about 1,600 employees of the Cape Breton Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   Ottawa plans to sell its coal assets, including the Prince colliery in Point
Aconi, by the end of the year. It closed another mine, Phalen in nearby New
Waterford, in December.

Amateur Boxing Association Gives Up Fight on No-Beard Rule
</P>
<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- Canada's amateur boxing association has thrown in the towel
in a legal fight with a Sikh boxer who argued the rule against beards in the
ring is discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
	   In an agreement expected to be approved by the courts on Wednesday, any
boxer who sports whiskers as a matter of faith will now be allowed to box, Hank
Summers, president of the Canadian Amateur Boxing Association, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They do have to have a bona fide religious (reason),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of the agreement, the association will also have to try again for a
change to the international rule against beards.
</P>
<P>
	   The issue came to a head last month when the boxing organization went around
a last-minute Ontario court ruling by scrapping the entire light-flyweight
division at a national tournament in British Columbia rather than allow Pardeep
Nagra to fight.

<P>
    KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Kara Lawson scored a career-high 25 points and
Michelle Snow added 24 to lead No. 2 Tennessee to a 79-69 victory Monday night
over Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lady Vols (12-2, 2-0 Southeastern Conference) rebounded from Saturday's
loss to No. 1 Connecticut despite a poor first-half performance that left them
trailing by 13 points at halftime. Arkansas (9-4, 0-1) was led by Wendi Willits
with 16 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee quickly recovered in the second half, using a 20-6 run in the
first 6-  1/2 minutes to retake the lead at 46-45. Lawson, who also had 10
rebounds, and Snow led the offensive charge, combining for 13 points in the
spurt.
</P>
<P>
	   Another slump by the Lady Razorbacks -- who failed to score during a
7-minute stretch against a tenacious Tennessee defense -- allowed the Lady Vols
to take control at 64-52 with seven minutes left.
</P>
<P>
	   Tamika Catchings, who added 13 points, and Snow carried the offensive load
down the stretch for Tennessee. Willits tried to rally Arkansas, hitting two
late 3-pointers, but the Lady Razorbacks couldn't challenge Tennessee in the
final minutes.
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee was at its worst in the first half.
</P>
<P>
	   The Lady Vols struggled offensively the entire half, shooting just 27
percent from the field. Arkansas didn't shoot much better, but managed to stay
close and took its first lead at 9-8 on Celia Anderson's layup at 12:20.
</P>
<P>
	   Back-to-back 3-pointers by Tennessee's April McDivitt and Lawson allowed the
Lady Vols to regain the lead. But a 16-2 run by the Lady Razorbacks gave
Arkansas a 26-18 lead with 4:24 left in the half.
</P>
<P>
	   Tennessee fought back behind Lawson, who hit another 3-pointer and short
jump shot in the closing minutes. But Arkansas didn't wilt, outscoring the Lady
Vols 13-10 in a late first-half run that gave the Lady Razorbacks a 39-26
halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Arkansas hit 6-of-6 free throws in the final three minutes of the first
half.

<HEADLINE> Delphi Acquires Diesel Co. From TRW  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    FLINT, Mich. (AP) -- Delphi Automotive Systems has taken a step toward
increasing its presence in Europe by acquiring Lucas Diesel Systems from TRW
Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   The $871 million purchase was announced Monday by Delphi. Company officials
said the deal should allow the automotive component and systems company to raise
its sales in Europe by 20 percent, or to more than $5 billion annually.
</P>
<P>
	   "Delphi is now uniquely positioned to offer customers complete gas and
diesel engine management systems, including fuel handling, air control,
emissions after treatment, sensors, and actuators, and sophisticated electronic
control," Delphi President J.T. Battenberg III said.
</P>
<P>
	   Delphi officials said the purchase of Lucas will also increase by 16 percent
the company's revenue not derived from sales to General Motors.
</P>
<P>
	   Lucas will be renamed Delphi Diesel Systems and become part of the company's
energy and chassis systems division. Lucas' managing director Dominique Chauvin
will hold the same position at Delphi.
</P>
<P>
	   The operation will employ 8,600 at 12 manufacturing facilities in seven
countries.
</P>
<P>
	   "With the continued increase of diesel penetration around the world,
especially in Europe, we see tremendous growth opportunities," Battenberg said.
"In short, we believe this is the right move at the right time."
</P>
<P>
	   The Troy, Mich.-based Delphi has 210,000 employees and operates 180
manufacturing sites worldwide.

<P>
    SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- Tim Duncan scored a career-high 46 points to lead the
San Antonio Spurs to a 93-86 victory over the Utah Jazz, and back into first
place in the NBA's Midwest Division.
</P>
<P>
	   The Spurs, who now lead the Jazz by a half game, had only two players in
double figures as Terry Porter added 16 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Duncan, who also pulled down 14 rebounds, was 16-of-28 from the floor and
14-of-16 at the free throw line as he topped his previous career-high of 42
points.
</P>
<P>
	   Karl Malone scored 23 points to lead Utah, Howard Eisley added 16 and Bryon
Russell had 15.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah closed the third quarter with a 10-2 run capped by Eisley's 3-point
field goal with 46 seconds remaining that gave the Jazz a 68-59 lead going into
the fourth.
</P>
<P>
	   Trailing 70-61 after a dunk by Greg Ostertag, San Antonio rallied with a
17-4 run, capped by a breakaway dunk by Antonio Daniels with 6:11 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   With Duncan dominating in the low post, San Antonio stretched its advantage
to 84-78 on Duncan's jump shot with 1:56 to play.
</P>
<P>
	   Two free throws by John Stockton brought Utah to 84-82 with 1:13 remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Porter put the game away for San Antonio with consecutive 3-pointers in the
final 51.1 seconds. His second gave San Antonio a 90-84 lead with 16.9 seconds
to play.
</P>
<P>
	   Utah scored its final eight points at the free throw line, with Malone
connecting on a pair to bring the Jazz to within 90-86 with 10.8 seconds
remaining.
</P>
<P>
	   Porter and Duncan answered with three free throws in the final 10.3 seconds
to seal the victory.
</P>
<P>
	   Duncan had 14 of San Antonio's 20 second quarter points as the two teams
played to a 41-41 halftime tie.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Minister To Visit S. Korea  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- China's defense minister will visit military bases
and pay a courtesy call on President Kim-Dae-jung during a trip to South Korea
next week, South Korea said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Chi Haotian will also meet his counterpart in Seoul, Cho Sung-tae, during
his five-day visit, which starts Jan. 19, the Defense Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
	   Cho visited Beijing in August last year and held the first talks between
defense ministers of the two nations, adversaries during the 1950-53 Korean War.
</P>
<P>
	   At that time, local media reported that Cho asked Chi to dissuade communist
North Korea from test-firing a long-range missile. China urged both countries to
reduce tensions on the Korean peninsula.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, North Korea test-fired a missile, which flew over Japan and landed
in the Pacific Ocean. Pyongyang agreed not to go ahead with another test last
year after the United States agreed to a partial lifting of sanctions against
it.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States fought on South Korea's side while China backed North
Korea during the Korean War, which ended with an armistice, not a permanent
peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
	   Chi led a Chinese battalion against U.S. and South Korean forces during the
war.
</P>
<P>
	   China opened diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992. China is
currently South Korea's third-largest trading partner, while South Korea is
China's fifth largest.

	   HAVANA, Cuba (AP) -- Thousands of protesters demanding the return of
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez fell silent today upon hearing the announcement that
an American judge had ordered the boy to stay in the United States until at
least March. The demonstrators had gathered for the latest in a monthlong string
of rallies lobbying for Elian to be returned from Miami to Cuba and be reunited
with his father. Many looked stunned when Hassan Perez, head of student group
tied to the government, announced the decision that had come that day in

Evidence of Europa Ocean Exists
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- New evidence from NASA's Galileo spacecraft bolsters
theories that a liquid ocean lies beneath the crust of Jupiter's moon Europa,
scientists reported today after analyzing results from the probe's latest flyby.
The findings indirectly support the case for life beneath the moon's icy crust.
Some experts believe primitive organisms could survive just as they do deep in
the Earth's ocean near volcanic vents. "Certainly if you are going to look for
other environments where life might form or be able to survive, this might be a
good one," said Torrence Johnson, Galileo's project scientist at NASA's Jet
Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena.

going to the wealthiest 10 percent of Americans.

tonight for killing his girlfriend's parents when he was 17. Thomas, 26, made no
final statement. Thomas fatally shot James Baxter Wiseman and Kathy Wiseman as
they slept in their Middlesex home on Nov. 10, 1990. The Wisemans had been
trying to end the relationship between Thomas and their daughter, who was also
convicted in the killing. In a telephone interview last week, Thomas said it was

the same crime, was released years ago.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Citizen Charged in Bombings  </HEADLINE>
   By LARRY NEUMEISTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- An American citizen who allegedly once served as personal
secretary to Osama bin Laden was ordered held without bail Monday on charges
that he was part of the conspiracy behind the 1998 embassy bombings in Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   Wadih El Hage, who is from Arlington, Texas, was again denied bail after a
federal judge ruled that he still poses a danger to society and might flee. El
Hage was arrested in 1998 and was ordered held bail.
</P>
<P>
	   Bin Laden and El Hage are among 18 people indicted in a conspiracy to attack
Americans in the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The
attacks killed 224 people, including 12 Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald said El Hage returned to Texas in 1997
from a trip abroad and brought with him new terrorism directives from bin
Laden's group that made clear the organization's violent objectives, especially
in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The ultimate results were the bombings which occurred in August 1998,''
Fitzgerald said.
</P>
<P>
	   The evidence cited by Fitzgerald was the closest the government had come
publicly to accusing El Hage of a direct role in the bombings. The prosecutor
said El Hage's role as a communicator in bin Laden's group made it likely that,
if freed on bail, he would try to tell the group the extent of the government's
knowledge of their activities.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Leonard B. Sand also cited a personal experience as he
ruled that El Hage should not be freed on bail.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge noted the day last June when El Hage, angry because he was not
allowed to have a letter read into the record during a hearing, leaped over a
railing and charged toward Sand. He got within several feet before he was
tackled by federal marshals.
</P>
<P>
	   Sam Schmidt, El Hage's lawyer, said prosecutors had failed to cite ``a
single thing'' that showed El Hage posed a danger to society. He said El Hage
offered no resistance as marshals handcuffed him against a wall that day.

<HEADLINE> Sele Spurns Orioles For Mariners  </HEADLINE>
    By RONALD BLUM AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Aaron Sele, who has one of baseball's best curveballs,
threw one off the field, too.
</P>
<P>
	   After his deal with Baltimore came apart over his physical, Sele quickly
agreed Monday night on a $15 million, two-year contract with the Seattle
Mariners.
</P>
<P>
	   "This thing is like a star falling out of the sky," new Mariners general
manager Pat Gillick said. "We're satisfied Sele is as healthy as he was when he
finished the season with the Rangers. He underwent a physical on behalf of us
with another physician, and our physician talked with that doctor and is
satisfied."
</P>
<P>
	   Sele, a 29-year-old right-hander, had reached a tentative agreement last
Friday on a $29 million, four-year contract with the Orioles, a deal that
contained $8 million deferred without interest.
</P>
<P>
	   But that agreement was subject to his passing a physical, and the contract
was never completed. The Orioles considered changes after the medical tests and
were still talking to Sele's agents on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   In the meantime, the pitcher who lives in Kirkland, Wash., turned his
attention to the Mariners, one of baseball's busiest teams this winter.
</P>
<P>
	   Seattle spent much of the offseason considering trades for Ken Griffey Jr.,
but now seems likely to keep him. He is eligible for free agency after the
season and the Mariners had considered deals so they wouldn't win up losing him
for nothing next fall.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, having already signed free agents John Olerud, Arthur Rhodes, Mark
McLemore, Stan Javier and Japanese reliever Kazuhiro Sasaki, Gillick and the
Mariners may be sending Griffey a message that they are trying to win now.
</P>
<P>
	   "We do mean business and we do want to be competitive," said Gillick, who
called the signing a "morale-booster."
</P>
<P>
	   "As we all know, the Yankees and Cleveland are the cream of the crop in the
American League. But you never know what happens. If you win your division and
get in the playoffs, you never know what happens."
</P>
<P>
	   Gillick -- a former GM for Baltimore owner Peter Angelos -- began talks
after Adam Katz, one of Sele's agents, called him Monday. Just 6 1/2 hours
later, he completed negotiations to get Sele, who went to Washington State.
</P>
<P>
	   The new contract calls for a $1 million signing bonus and annual salaries of
$7 million, with none of the money deferred.
</P>
<P>
	   According to another of Sele's agents, Tom Reich, there was a difference on
interpretation with the Orioles on medical tests. Sele has never undergone arm
surgery but was limited to six starts in 1995 because of shoulder tendinitis.
</P>
<P>
	   "The dealing with Baltimore were very cordial from beginning to end and just
didn't work out," Reich said. "To me, Peter Angelos is a good guy."
</P>
<P>
	   Angelos did not return a telephone call seeking comment. After the 1998
season, the Orioles reached a $2.7 million, two-year agreement with reliever
Xavier Hernandez but the deal came undone when the Orioles said he had a
shoulder injury. He then signed a $250,000 agreement with the Astros and won $2
million in a grievance.
</P>
<P>
	   Gillick said Sele had a new physical Monday in California while negotiations
were taking place by telephone.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is going to be normal wear and tear," Gillick said. "You really have
to rely on your medical people. They know which bumps along the road you have to
watch for and which you can work through."
</P>
<P>
	   The Mariners, third in the AL West last season at 79-83, head into spring
training with perhaps the top starting rotation in their division, a group that
includes Jamie Moyer, John Halama and Freddy Garcia.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's great talk in the winter," Gillick said. "You have to do it on the
field."
</P>
<P>
	   The Mariners had tried to sign Chuck Finley, wanting a left-hander who could
beat the best AL teams, but the Indians had gotten him for $27 million over
three years.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, the Mariners were just 1-9 against New York, 3-7 against
Cleveland and 5-8 against Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Sele was 18-9 with a 4.79 ERA with the Texas Rangers last year after going
19-11 with a 4.23 ERA in 1998. In his two years with Texas, Sele missed only one
start, and that was because of flu symptoms.
</P>
<P>
	   He spent the first five years of his major league career with the Boston Red
Sox and has a 75-53 career record.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think this is a business where timing is very important. You only have a
very small window," Gillick said. "You have to react very quickly. Those who
hesitate, as they say, are lost."

<HEADLINE> Cowbys' Gailey Unsure of Future  </HEADLINE>
    By JAIME ARON AP Sports Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   IRVING, Texas (AP) -- Even after an hourlong meeting Monday with Dallas
Cowboy owner Jerry Jones, coach Chan Gailey doesn't know if he'll be keeping his
job.
</P>
<P>
	   Gailey said the talk centered on personnel issues such as free agents and
college players available for the draft. The second-year coach said he resisted
flat-out asking Jones if he is considering changing coaches.
</P>
<P>
	   "Did I want to? Probably," Gailey said. "It's better to let him. Instead of
me commenting on anything, when he gets ready to make a statement, he'll make a
statement."
</P>
<P>
	   Although Gailey didn't ask the big question, he would like an answer, he
agreed.
</P>
<P>
	   "The sooner the better," said Gailey, who for the first time this season at
Valley Ranch wasn't wearing a Cowboys shirt or hat.
</P>
<P>
	   Gailey's job is in jeopardy because Dallas followed an 8-8 regular season
with a 27-10 loss to Minnesota on Sunday. It was the team's biggest defeat of
the season and marked the second straight year the Cowboys were knocked out in
the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
	   Last season, Gailey's first with the Cowboys, Dallas went 10-6 and won the
NFC East before being eliminated 20-7 by Arizona.
</P>
<P>
	   Jones' support of Gailey has gone from absolute to abstract in recent weeks.
Instead of standing solidly behind the coach, Jones has refrained from
discussing his coach.
</P>
<P>
	   The pair walked off the Metrodome field Sunday about 15 feet apart. Jones
told the media he wanted to reserve comment for a few days before discussing the
coach's status.
</P>
<P>
	   Gailey said he senses he could be fired because of what he's read. Jones,
though, has never directly said publicly that he's considering making a change.
</P>
<P>
	   "No, but he gets asked the question and he doesn't deny it," Gailey said.
"That's what I read in the paper."
</P>
<P>
	   Jones was not immediately available for comment. Team spokesman Rich
Dalrymple said the owner will be involved in NFL meetings later this week and
could be tied up for days.
</P>
<P>
	   Gailey was Pittsburgh's offensive coordinator when Jones hired him to
replace Barry Switzer in February 1998. Jones, who wanted a creative offensive
mind, proclaimed "Chan's the man!" and even wrote into the contract that Gailey
would always call the plays.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of this season's problems came from the Cowboys' inability to move the
ball, especially in the second half of games. Dallas lost four games despite
holding the other team to 13 points.
</P>
<P>
	   Gailey said he doesn't believe that being the head coach and offensive
coordinator is too much for him. He said that he and Jones did not discuss
whether Gailey should start looking for a coordinator.
</P>
<P>
	   The coach said he would be willing to hire a coordinator, "If I had a guy."
</P>
<P>
	   Gailey said he wouldn't hire anyone who doesn't share his philosophy. If
someone were brought in with a different mindset.
</P>
<P>
	   "I probably wouldn't be the head coach," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   But Gailey is, and he'll keep doing his job until told otherwise, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm going to keep working as hard as I can until they say, "Don't come
back,' " he explained.

<HEADLINE> Marine Jet Crashes; Pilots OK  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   YUMA, Ariz. (AP) -- A Marine Corps jet crashed during a training exercise
Monday, but the two pilots ejected and did not suffer serious injuries, a
military spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   The F/A-18 Hornet fighter based in San Diego crashed east of Yuma, said Maj.
Stephen Kay, a spokesman for Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
	   The pilots were taken to Yuma Regional Medical Center for treatment of minor
injuries. No other aircraft were involved, Kay said.
</P>
<P>
	   The pilots are part of Marine Fighter Attack Squadron 242, which frequently
trains or refuels at the Yuma Marine Corps Air Station near the
Arizona-California line.
</P>
<P>
	   The cause of the crash is under investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   In June, another F/A-18 Hornet based at Miramar crashed during an exercise
near Yuma. The two pilots ejected; one died.
</P>
<P>
	   In November, an F/A-18 Hornet from the Navy's Blue Angels precision flying
team based in Pensacola, Fla., crashed during a training flight near Moody Air
Force Base in Georgia. Both people aboard were killed.
</P>
<P>
	   The F/A-18 is a twin-seat attack jet manufactured by the McDonnell Douglas
Corp. It costs $28 million and was first used by the Marine Corps in October
1989.

<HEADLINE> Karmapa Hasn't Requested Asylum  </HEADLINE>
   By DEEPAK SHARMA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DHARMSALA, India (AP) -- A teen-age Buddhist leader who fled Chinese-ruled
Tibet has not asked India for asylum, a member of the Dalai Lama's
government-in-exile said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The 14-year-old Karmapa arrived in Dharmsala on Wednesday after an eight-day
trek over the Himalayas.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have not applied to the government of India,'' said K.A. Lontashiwangd,
religious affairs minister in the Dalai Lama's administration. ``But if the
government decided to give asylum, that can be accepted.''
</P>
<P>
	   India's Foreign Office spokesman, Raminder Singh Jassal, told an informal
press briefing that the government is looking into the circumstances and
consequences of the Karmapa's arrival.
</P>
<P>
	   The Karmapa's defection is the most significant exodus since the Dalai Lama
and tens of thousands of Tibetans departed their homeland after a failed 1959
uprising against Chinese rule.
</P>
<P>
	   Both China and India have reacted cautiously to the defection.
</P>
<P>
	   China's fragile ties with India suffered a setback after India conducted
nuclear tests in May 1998, citing China as a security threat. India and China
fought a war in 1962.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Julia Taft arrived in India on Monday and
flew to Dharmsala, the seat of the Dalai Lama's government-in-exile, where she
will visit Tibetans as part of her job to investigate the conditions of refugees
and migrants.
</P>
<P>
	   Jassal said Taft's trip had been scheduled before the news of the Karmapa's
escape.
</P>
<P>
	   Early Sunday, the Karmapa left the Chonor Guest House, where he had stayed
since his arrival here. The Dalai Lama's administrators refused to say where he
went.
</P>
<P>
	   But local police and monks, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he had
moved to Gyuto monastery in Sidvari, 10 miles southeast of Dharmsala, where the
exile Tibetan community has its biggest university.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have shifted him to keep him away from the media and his followers,''
Longtashiwangd said. ``We want him to have a good rest.''
</P>
<P>
	   China approved the 17th Karmapa's enthronement in 1992 and used him as a
symbol to project its toleration of Tibetan Buddhism. He is the only high lama
whose accession had been agreed upon by both the Chinese authorities and the
Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
	   The Karmapa's Kagyu sect, known as the ``Black Hats,'' is one of four main
strands of Tibetan Buddhism.

<HEADLINE> Head of U.S. Army Visits No Gun Ri  </HEADLINE>
   By KYONG-HWA SEOK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NO GUN RI, South Korea (AP) -- The head of the U.S. Army met Monday with
survivors of an alleged mass killing of refugees by American soldiers during the
Korean War and promised a thorough investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   Army Secretary Louis Caldera made the pledge when he visited No Gun Ri, a
hamlet in central South Korea where survivors say American soldiers killed
hundreds of refugees in the first weeks of the Korean War in 1950.
</P>
<P>
	   Caldera's first visit to No Gun Ri was part of a U.S. government inquiry. He
told a dozen survivors that the United States ``is committed to a thorough
investigation'' alongside South Korean authorities.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, Caldera met with Chung Hae-joo, South Korea's minister for
government policy coordination. Caldera planned to meet with President Kim
Dae-jung later in the day.
</P>
<P>
	   Before Monday's meeting, Caldera, accompanied by 18 other American officials
and advisers, visited a railroad tunnel where survivors say up to 400 civilian
refugees were machine-gunned by American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Where exactly were the soldiers?'' Caldera asked during a briefing by a
survivor in front of the tunnel. ``How many machine guns were there?''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I don't know, but the bullets rained down from everywhere,'' Chung Ku-ho
responded through an interpreter. Chung, then 13, was one of several dozen
villagers who survived the attack.
</P>
<P>
	   Declassified U.S. military documents said American ground commanders feared
that enemy soldiers, disguised in the common white clothing of civilians, were
mixing in South Korean refugee columns.
</P>
<P>
	   During Caldera's visit to No Gun Ri, several Koreans raised a banner that
read in English: ``You must know what you did. You must repay. Wake up from your
ignorance.''
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in Seoul, Caldera met South Korean Defense Minster Cho Sung-tae and
his deputy, Park Young-ok.
</P>
<P>
	   In September, The Associated Press quoted dozens of villagers and U.S.
veterans as saying that hundreds of Korean civilians were killed at No Gun Ri by
American soldiers who feared communist North Korean soldiers were infiltrating
groups of refugees.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States and South Korea had previously dismissed the claims, but
opened investigations after the AP report was published.
</P>
<P>
	   Since then, South Koreans have come forward with more stories of alleged
mass killings of civilians by U.S. troops. Historians say Korean forces on both
sides of the conflict committed atrocities.
</P>
<P>
	   The Army secretary told the AP on Sunday that the United States could not
study ``every firefight, every battle'' of the 1950-53 Korean War. Caldera said
all loss of life was regrettable, but emphasized the need to establish whether
civilians were killed intentionally.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States led a 16-nation U.N. force in defense of South Korea
against North Korea, which was backed by China and the Soviet Union. About
55,000 Americans were killed and more than 8,000 are still listed as missing.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Citizen Charged in Bombings  </HEADLINE>
   By LARRY NEUMEISTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- An American citizen who allegedly once served as personal
secretary to Osama bin Laden was ordered held without bail Monday on charges
that he was part of the conspiracy behind the 1998 embassy bombings in Africa.
</P>
<P>
	   Wadih El Hage, who is from Arlington, Texas, was again denied bail after a
federal judge ruled that he still poses a danger to society and might flee. El
Hage was arrested in 1998 and ordered held without bail.
</P>
<P>
	   Bin Laden and El Hage are among 18 people indicted in a conspiracy to attack
Americans in the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. The
attacks killed 224 people, including 12 Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal prosecutor Patrick Fitzgerald said El Hage returned to Texas in 1997
from a trip abroad and brought with him new terrorism directives from bin
Laden's group that made clear the organization's violent objectives, especially
in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The ultimate results were the bombings which occurred in August 1998,''
Fitzgerald said.
</P>
<P>
	   The evidence cited by Fitzgerald was the closest the government had come
publicly to accusing El Hage of a direct role in the bombings. The prosecutor
said El Hage's role as a communicator in bin Laden's group made it likely that,
if freed on bail, he would try to tell the group the extent of the government's
knowledge of their activities.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Leonard B. Sand also cited a personal experience as he
ruled that El Hage should not be freed on bail.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge noted the day last June when El Hage, angry because he was not
allowed to have a letter read into the record during a hearing, leaped over a
railing and charged toward Sand. He got within several feet before he was
tackled by federal marshals.
</P>
<P>
	   Sam Schmidt, El Hage's lawyer, said prosecutors had failed to cite ``a
single thing'' that showed El Hage posed a danger to society. He said El Hage
offered no resistance as marshals handcuffed him against a wall that day.

<HEADLINE> Judge To Hear Cuba Boy Arguments  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEX VEIGA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- A Florida judge on Monday ordered 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to
remain in the United States until March, a ruling that delighted the Cuban boy's
relatives in Miami and defied a federal government order that he be sent back to
Cuba by Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Rosa Rodriguez issued a temporary protective order
so she can hear arguments filed by Elian's Miami relatives, who are seeking
temporary custody of him. The order leaves Elian in the custody of the relatives
until the March 6 hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Waving a copy of the ruling, Lazaro Gonzalez, the great-uncle who is seeking
temporary custody of Elian, yelled ``Victory for Elian!'' in Spanish before
going inside the family's home in Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Today is a great day for Elian,'' said his attorney, Spencer Eig. ''(The
ruling) will provide Elian Gonzalez his day in court.''
</P>
<P>
	   If Lazaro Gonzalez is appointed Elian's guardian, he could seek political
asylum for the boy.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found Thanksgiving Day off the coast of Fort Lauderdale, clinging
to an inner tube after his mother, stepfather and others drowned while
attempting to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   In a case that has touched off huge protests in Miami and Cuba, the
Immigration and Naturalization Service ruled last week that Elian should be
returned to his father in Cuba by Friday -- a ruling endorsed by President
Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS said it found that the boy had a close relationship with his father
and was ordering Elian back to Cuba because he ``belongs with his father.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the judge said Monday that the petition from the boy's Miami relatives
``contains sufficient verified allegations that if emergency relief is not
granted and Elian is returned to Cuba he would be subjected to imminent and
irreparable harm, including loss of due process rights and harm to his physical
and mental health and emotional well-being.''
</P>
<P>
	   INS spokeswoman Maria Cardona said the agency had no comment until its
lawyers had a chance to examine the ruling. Another INS spokesman, Mike Gilhooly
said: ``The INS has no plans to do any enforcement action on Elian. We have no
plans to change the custody arrangement of him being with his Miami family.'' He
did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   Bernard Perlmutter, director of the University of Miami's Children and Youth
Law Clinic, said the judge's decision was ``politically popular,'' but legally
wrong. He said the INS can ignore Rodriguez's decision and return the boy to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   By the time the ruling was announced, thousands of Cubans were already
crowding around the U.S. Interests Section in Havana for a pro-Elian rally.
Hassan Perez, president of the government's Federation of University Students,
called the ruling ``illegal and arbitrary.''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, said his ex-wife did not get his
permission to take Elian out of Cuba. Gonzalez, with the backing of the Cuban
government, has demanded that his son be returned. But Elian's relatives in
Miami say they can give him a better life off the communist island.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of Rodriguez's ruling, Gonzalez was ordered to appear at the March
hearing. Her order said that his ``failure to appear may result in a decision
adverse to his interests.'' Gonzalez has said that he would not travel to the
United States to retrieve his son.
</P>
<P>
	   Rodriguez, of Puerto Rican heritage, was elected to the Miami-Dade Circuit
Court bench in 1998 and was transferred to family court in the fall after being
accused of campaign finance violations by her rival. She denied wrongdoing and
an investigation continues.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami-Dade Commissioner Jimmy Morales, who backed her campaign, said she
will remain objective in determining her decision for Elian. ``She's extremely
bright,'' he said. ``I think Elian will get his fair shake with Rosa
Rodriguez.''
</P>
<P>
	   The international tug-of-war over the young boy now includes several efforts
by Congress to intervene in his case. On Friday, Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., tried
to delay Elian's departure by issuing a subpoena that requires the boy to
testify before a House committee Feb. 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore has even become involved, questioning earlier Monday
whether the INS had the expertise to decide Elian's fate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'd like to see the dispute adjudicated in our courts, where traditionally
questions like what is best for this child are decided,'' Gore said in an
interview on NBC's ``Today'' show. ``This child's mother died in an effort to
get her child's freedom.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the White House on Monday, Clinton would not comment on Gore's comments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Anybody's free to express their opinion about this on whether they think
they did right or wrong,'' the president said. Like Gore, he also would not
comment on Burton's subpoena.

<HEADLINE> Asian Nations Top Economy List  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BRISCOE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two societies viewed by human rights groups as under
authoritarian regimes were cited by international economists Monday as the most
economically free in the world -- Hong Kong and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
	   An index compiled with the help of think tanks in 53 countries ranks
countries on a variety of economic issues. It reaches the same conclusion about
the top of the list as a similar report by the conservative Heritage Foundation
last month. Both also scored New Zealand third and the United States fourth.
</P>
<P>
	   Hong Kong topped economic freedom lists before it was returned to China in
1997 and has not slipped, said the report's principal author, James Gwartney.
Criteria for the ranking include the size of government, structure of the
economy, monetary policies, price stability, freedom to use alternative
currencies, recognition of property rights, freedom of trade, and openness to
international markets.
</P>
<P>
	   The governments of Singapore and of China, which allows Hong Kong some
freedoms not enjoyed in the rest of the country, are both listed as
authoritarian regimes by the pro-democracy Freedom House in its latest report
ranking countries according to the exercise of political freedom and civil
liberties.
</P>
<P>
	   Gwartney said that although political and civil freedoms are not part of the
index, high economic freedom tends to increase pressure for democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't think the fact we have elections is what counts for the high level
of achievement of the United States," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The annual Economic Freedom of the World report was published by the Cato
Institute and Canada's Fraser Institute and released at news conferences in
Washington and Hong Kong. Sponsors said it was constructed under the leadership
of Milton Friedman, Nobel prize winner.
</P>
<P>
	   "It shows the critical role that economic freedom plays in achieving and
maintaining prosperity," said Ian Vasquez of Cato, which advocates limited
government, free markets, individual liberty and peace.
</P>
<P>
	   Other countries ranking in the top 10 were the United Kingdom, Ireland,
Australia, Canada, Luxembourg, and in a tie for tenth, Netherlands and
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
	   The least free economies among 123 surveyed were Burma, Democratic Republic
of Congo, Sierra Leone, Rwanda, Madagascar and Guinea-Bissau.

<HEADLINE> No.5 Connecticut 77, No.15 Texas 67  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM O'CONNELL AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) -- Albert Mouring was perfect from long range as
Connecticut built a 17-point lead, then Khalid El-Amin made the big plays down
the stretch as the fifth-ranked Huskies beat No. 15 Texas 77-67 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Huskies (12-2) were making their first appearance at the Hartford Civic
Center since losing there last Wednesday to Notre Dame, a loss that dropped them
three spots in the Top 25.
</P>
<P>
	   With Mouring having a second good game from 3-point range -- he went 4-for-5
in Saturday's win at Pittsburgh -- Connecticut built a 56-39 lead with 12:35 to
play in the very physical game that featured a lot of whistles and little
action.
</P>
<P>
	   Mouring's fifth 3 in as many attempts gave the Huskies their biggest lead
and it seemed they would coast to the win.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Longhorns (9-4) went on a 15-3 run as Connecticut scored once in 11
possessions and were within 59-54 with 4:46 left on two free throws by Ivan
Wagner.
</P>
<P>
	   That's when El-Amin, the point guard who led Connecticut to the national
championship last season, took over and was responsible for scores on the next
three possessions.
</P>
<P>
	   He found freshman Tony Robertson on the break for a layup that made it
61-54. After Chris Mihm scored for Texas, El-Amin and Connecticut center Jake
Voskuhl worked a nice screen and roll play that saw the big man dunk for a 63-56
lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas again answered on a hook shot by Mihm, but El-Amin extended the lead
by working the same screen and roll with Voskuhl only this time the guard didn't
pass to the center and instead nailed a 3-pointer for a 66-58 lead with 3:01 to
play.
</P>
<P>
	   The Longhorns got within 71-67 on a 3-pointer by Wagner with 25 seconds left
but Mouring and Edmund Saunders each made two free throws and Saunders scored on
a layup after a steal by El-Amin for the final margin.
</P>
<P>
	   Mouring finished with 21 points, one off his career high, while El-Amin had
14 points and eight assists. Voskuhl had nine points and 11 rebounds in his
matchup with Mihm, which drew 22 NBA scouts.
</P>
<P>
	   Mihm finished with 18 points and 10 rebounds, scoring eight points over the
final six minutes. Gabe Muoneke and Darren Kelly each added 12 points for Texas.
</P>
<P>
	   Texas, which shot 33 percent (24-for-72), really hurt itself at the free
throw line, going 13-for-25 as it had a three-game winning streak snapped.
</P>
<P>
	   Connecticut shot 44 percent (24-for-54) and led by Mouring's 5-for-6, went
6-for-10 from 3-point range.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Protesters Fall Silent  </HEADLINE>
   By ANITA SNOW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA, Cuba (AP) -- The communist government on Monday blasted a Miami
judge's decision to order Elian Gonzalez to stay in the United States until at
least March, saying those blocking the boy's return to Cuba are ``beasts whose
hearts cannot hear.''
</P>
<P>
	   Many among the thousands of people gathered for the latest in a month of
rallies looked stunned when student leader Hassan Perez announced that the
decision had come just hours before.
</P>
<P>
	   The order issued by Miami-Dade County Circuit Judge Rosa Rodriguez was
``illegal and arbitrary,'' charged Perez, president of the government's
Federation of University Students.
</P>
<P>
	   Perez has been regularly called upon to deliver the government's central
message during the rallies demanding that Elian be returned from Miami to Cuba
and be reunited with his father. Seen as an important future communist leader,
Perez is also a deputy in Cuba's National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
	   The judge has ``given the child Elian Gonzalez to the unknown uncle, who had
him taken hostage in complicity with the mafia and the extreme right,'' Perez
told the crowd as the protests resumed outside the American mission in Havana.
In recent weeks, the government has varied the location of the rallies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Who are these beasts whose hearts do not hear, who fight to keep a child
who has become a world symbol?'' he asked. The Cuban exiles in Miami, he said,
will use ``all of their resources to impede the child's return.''
</P>
<P>
	   Perez's lengthy speech went on to criticize individual exile leaders and
their varied legal attempts to keep the boy in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Perez ended his comments with the traditional Cuban communist signoff:
``Fatherland or death! We will overcome!'' and the applause of the crowd.
</P>
<P>
	   The temporary protective order -- issued Monday in defiance of a federal
government order that Elian be returned to Cuba by Friday -- sets a March 6
hearing for Rodriguez to hear arguments by Elian's Miami relatives seeking to
keep him in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found Thanksgiving Day clinging to an inner tube off Florida's
coast. His mother was lost at sea in the apparent attempt to emigrate illegally
to the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   By the time the news was being announced in Miami late Monday afternoon,
thousands were already crowding around the U.S. Interests Section on Havana's
main coastal highway for the pro-Elian rally announced in the morning.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the idea is absurd,'' Cuban protester Leonil Feliu said of the
judge's ruling. ``What they are doing is prolonging the process. They know at
the end of the day that they have to bring him to Cuba. All they are doing is
lengthening the inevitable.''

<HEADLINE> Judge To Hear Cuba Boy Arguments  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEX VEIGA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- A Florida judge on Monday ordered 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to
remain in the United States until March, a ruling that delighted the Cuban boy's
relatives in Miami and defied a federal government order that he be sent back to
Cuba by Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Rosa Rodriguez issued a temporary protective order
so she can hear arguments filed by Elian's Miami relatives, who are seeking
temporary custody of him. The order leaves Elian in the custody of the relatives
until the March 6 hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   Waving a copy of the ruling, Lazaro Gonzalez, the great-uncle who is seeking
temporary custody of Elian, yelled ``Victory for Elian!'' in Spanish before
going inside the family's home in Little Havana.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Today is a great day for Elian,'' said his attorney, Spencer Eig. ''(The
ruling) will provide Elian Gonzalez his day in court.''
</P>
<P>
	   If Lazaro Gonzalez is appointed Elian's guardian, he could seek political
asylum for the boy.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian was found Thanksgiving Day off the coast of Fort Lauderdale, clinging
to an inner tube after his mother, stepfather and others drowned while
attempting to reach the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   In a case that has touched off huge protests in Miami and Cuba, the
Immigration and Naturalization Service ruled last week that Elian should be
returned to his father in Cuba by Friday -- a ruling endorsed by President
Clinton and Attorney General Janet Reno.
</P>
<P>
	   The INS said it found that the boy had a close relationship with his father
and was ordering Elian back to Cuba because he ``belongs with his father.''
</P>
<P>
	   But the judge said Monday that the petition from the boy's Miami relatives
``contains sufficient verified allegations that if emergency relief is not
granted and Elian is returned to Cuba he would be subjected to imminent and
irreparable harm, including loss of due process rights and harm to his physical
and mental health and emotional well-being.''
</P>
<P>
	   INS spokeswoman Maria Cardona said the agency had no comment until its
lawyers had a chance to examine the ruling. Another INS spokesman, Mike Gilhooly
said: ``The INS has no plans to do any enforcement action on Elian. We have no
plans to change the custody arrangement of him being with his Miami family.'' He
did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
	   Bernard Perlmutter, director of the University of Miami's Children and Youth
Law Clinic, said the judge's decision was ``politically popular,'' but legally
wrong. He said the INS can ignore Rodriguez's decision and return the boy to
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cuban government condemned the ruling. Hassan Perez, president of the
government's Federation of University Students, told thousands of people
gathered at a pro-Elian rally: ``Who are these beasts whose hearts do not hear,
who fight to keep a child who has become a world symbol?''
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, said his ex-wife did not get his
permission to take Elian out of Cuba. Gonzalez, with the backing of the Cuban
government, has demanded that his son be returned. But Elian's relatives in
Miami say they can give him a better life off the communist island.
</P>
<P>
	   As part of Rodriguez's ruling, Gonzalez was ordered to appear at the March
hearing. Her order said that his ``failure to appear may result in a decision
adverse to his interests.'' Gonzalez has said that he would not travel to the
United States to retrieve his son.
</P>
<P>
	   Rodriguez, of Puerto Rican heritage, was elected to the Miami-Dade Circuit
Court bench in 1998 and was transferred to family court in the fall after being
accused of campaign finance violations by her rival. She denied wrongdoing and
an investigation continues.
</P>
<P>
	   Miami-Dade Commissioner Jimmy Morales, who backed her campaign, said she
will remain objective in determining her decision for Elian. ``She's extremely
bright,'' he said. ``I think Elian will get his fair shake with Rosa
Rodriguez.''
</P>
<P>
	   The international tug-of-war over the young boy now includes several efforts
by Congress to intervene in his case. On Friday, Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., tried
to delay Elian's departure by issuing a subpoena that requires the boy to
testify before a House committee Feb. 10.
</P>
<P>
	   Vice President Al Gore has even become involved, questioning earlier Monday
whether the INS had the expertise to decide Elian's fate.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'd like to see the dispute adjudicated in our courts, where traditionally
questions like what is best for this child are decided,'' Gore said in an
interview on NBC's ``Today'' show. ``This child's mother died in an effort to
get her child's freedom.''
</P>
<P>
	   At the White House on Monday, Clinton would not comment on Gore's comments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Anybody's free to express their opinion about this on whether they think
they did right or wrong,'' the president said. Like Gore, he also would not
comment on Burton's subpoena.

President Al Gore planned to highlight the plan Tuesday in Iowa. Health policy,
and how to get insurance to 44 million uninsured Americans, has emerged as the

their masks. "They are the same people" who appeared in photographs published by

Evidence of Europa Ocean Exists

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- New evidence from NASA's Galileo spacecraft bolsters
theories that a liquid ocean lies beneath the crust of Jupiter's moon Europa,
scientists reported Monday after analyzing results from the probe's latest
flyby. The findings indirectly support the case for life beneath the moon's icy
crust. Some experts believe primitive organisms could survive just as they do
deep in the Earth's ocean near volcanic vents. "Certainly if you are going to
look for other environments where life might form or be able to survive, this
might be a good one," said Torrence Johnson, Galileo's project scientist at

<HEADLINE> Kaye calls for private collection agencies to go after fines  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Courts have not proven to be particularly good bill
collectors and it is time to turn that job over to the professionals, the
state's chief judge says.
<P>
	   Judith Kaye said private bill collectors will be hired to go after "every
penny we can" in court-ordered fines and surcharges. Six court jurisdictions
will be targeted at first, and Kaye said she'd like to expand the program
statewide if the returns are positive.
</P>
<P>
	   "Experience has shown that governmental institutions are not equipped to
function as collection agencies and are therefore not particularly successful at
this task," Kaye said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaye also called in her annual State of the Judiciary address Monday for
bolstering drug and community courts so they can handle many more misdemeanor
cases; establishing an inspector general to investigate whether the appointments
of fiduciaries and other lawyers are politically motivated; and continuing jury
reforms.
</P>
<P>
	   The state Office of Court Administration said private agencies would be used
at first to collect fines and surcharges imposed in six court jurisdictions:
Suffolk County Court, Suffolk District Court, Nassau District Court, Queens
state Supreme Court, New York City Criminal Court and Rochester City Court.
</P>
<P>
	   Jonathan Lippman, chief state administrative judge, said those courts were
picked because of the large amounts of outstanding payments due.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaye proposed using the money the collection agencies raise to help pay for
an increase in the fees paid to court-appointed lawyers who defend indigent New
Yorkers. Those fees are currently $40 an hour for in-court work and $25 an hour
for out-of-court time.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaye called those fee levels "absolutely ludicrous" and "totally
unrealistic" and said too many inexperienced lawyers are handling too many such
cases because they aren't worth the time of veteran lawyers. The entire legal
system suffers because of it, Kaye said.
</P>
<P>
	   She proposed increasing the assigned counsel fees to $75 an hour for felony
and Family Court cases and to $60 an hour for non-felony cases.
</P>
<P>
	   The president-elect of the state Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers,
Kathryn Kase, said Kaye was on the right track with her proposed fee increase.
But Kase said the proposal doesn't go far enough.
</P>
<P>
	   "Unless rates are raised to at least $100 per hour, we fear that competent
counsel will continue to flee the assigned counsel panels in urban areas where
overhead costs are higher than $60 per hour," Kase said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaye acknowledged that low-level nonviolent misdemeanor offenders are a
problem to the police, the communities the offenders live in and to the courts.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Gov. George Pataki proposed prosecuting as a felony a fourth
misdemeanor charge against a person with three prior misdemeanor convictions. He
said some criminals had dozens of such convictions on their records for offenses
such as shoplifting, marijuana possession and disorderly conduct without ever
serving prison time.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaye advocated a different approach. She said the prosecution of misdemeanor
offenders often turns into "human recycling" because the court system doesn't
have the capacity to hold actual trials. Of the 375,000 arrest cases in the New
York City Criminal Court last year, for example, only 822 or 0.2 percent, were
resolved at trial.
</P>
<P>
	   Kaye said the constant plea-bargaining serves neither defendants nor the
court system.
</P>
<P>
	   She said she will ask the Legislature to create 23 new Criminal Court
judgeships in New York City and also temporarily reassign state Supreme Court
justices to hear misdemeanor cases.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition, Kaye advocated changing the law so that more bench trials can
be held in misdemeanor cases and that more resources be given to drug and
community courts.
</P>
<P>
	   State Sen. James Lack, a Suffolk County Republican who chairs his chamber's
judiciary committee, said he favors putting more emphasis on drug courts and
other alternative forms of adjudicating cases to provide more room for trying
felony cases in the courts.

<HEADLINE> Pataki to propose sixth state budget to the Legislature  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Gov. George Pataki presents a proposed budget to the
state Legislature this morning that will be heavy on public education programs
and, apparently, light on the contentious issues which have prevented the 15
previous budgets in New York from being passed on time.
<P>
	   Riding years of budget surpluses, Wall Street prosperity, employment gains
and with no political war against the Legislature on the horizon, Pataki's sixth
budget could be his most harmonious as governor.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki's proposal will be for the 2000-01 fiscal year which begins April 1.
The state budget for the current year totals about $73.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
	   The broad outlines of Pataki's spending proposal began to take shape in
December, when the Legislature and governor agreed to the $9 billion, 3 1/2-year
Health Care Reform Act 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   That program contained two elements crucial to a more orderly budget passage
in 2000. The first was a commitment to spend most tobacco settlement money due
New York state until 2003 on health care programs for the uninsured. The act
also included a cease-fire of sorts between the state Assembly and Pataki over
the possibility of significant Medicaid cuts over that period.
</P>
<P>
	   Both the spending of the tobacco settlement and Medicaid cuts had figured to
be chief battlegrounds in Albany this year over the 2000-01 budget.
</P>
<P>
	   State Sen. Joseph Bruno, leader of the Senate's Republican majority, said
Medicaid in particular was a highly divisive issue which helped account for past
budget impasses in Albany. Both he and state Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a
Democrat, have said in the last week they see no reason why a budget cannot be
approved by the April 1 deadline this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki declared during his State of the State speech to lawmakers last week
that education would be the main thrust of his budget plan in 2000-01. He wants
to ensure that students get resources needed to improve themselves and that
schools are safe and intolerant of unruly pupils.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki said the tax-cutting proposals in his budget would center around the
gross receipts tax on energy - companies have long felt it is onerous and an
unfair disadvantage to doing business in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Bruno tried to score a few last-minute points for budget reform.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno said he would ask Pataki not to call any of the "three-men-in-a-room"
budget meetings. Those are the sessions, much criticized by reformers and many
legislators, where the governor, the Assembly speaker and the Senate majority
leader sit behind closed doors and hash out the most important aspects of new
budgets and other crucial matters.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm going to ask the governor not to call any, and the governor is the
governor and he'll do whatever he sees fit," Bruno said.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki spokeswoman Zenia Mucha said it would suit the governor fine if the
Legislature took his proposed budget, worked out its own budget in public in
conference committees and submitted it to Pataki for final approval.
</P>
<P>
	   "The governor has always said that he favors an open process and that they
should have conference committees," Mucha said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Legislature tried to devise a budget without Pataki's input via
conference committees in 1998, but was dismayed when Pataki vetoed hundreds of
millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year's budget was not given final approval by the Legislature until
Aug. 14, due largely to squabbles over education and Medicaid spending. Past
year's budgets have been delayed because of fights between Pataki and the
Assembly over Workers' Compensation reforms and the continuation of New York
City rent control laws.
