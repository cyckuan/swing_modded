<HEADLINE> EU Births at Post-War Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
statistical office Eurostat said on Friday that the number of
babies born in the 15 EU member states in 1998 is expected to have
fallen to nearly 4.01 million, about the same as the post-war low
recorded in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Eurostat said that, in the near future, the number of births
will probably continue to decrease as the large numbers of women
born in the mid-1960s "baby boom" move out of the peak
childbearing ages, and are replaced by the smaller numbers of
women born during 1965 to 1975. In 1997, the number of babies born
in EU was 4.05 million.
</P>
<P>
In the mid-1960s, the annual number of the live births was over
two million higher than today, but between 1965 and 1975 "
fertility dropped dramatically". It has been on a downward path
ever since, although there were modest increases recently in 1996
and 1997 to 4.03 million and 4.05 million respectively, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The statistics report noted that not all EU member states are
expected to have moved in the same direction in 1998. In Austria,
Finland Germany and Greece, falls in births should be considerable.
But France and the Netherlands are expected to see significant
rises.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the number of deaths in EU member states last year
is expected to have dropped to 3.69 million from 3.71 million in
1997. This will probably lead to a fall in EU natural population
growth from 336,000 in 1997 to 320,000 last year. The post-war low
was 278,000 in 1995, the Eurostat said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. world fastest female
sprinter Marion Jones received the coveted Jesse Owens
International Trophy Award as the world's outstanding amateur
athlete - male or female - for 1998.
</P>
<P>
With her name now linked to Owens, winner of four gold medals
at the 1936 Olympics and one of the greatest athletes in track and
field history, Jones wants to surpass the feats of the late
Florence Griffith Joyner, perhaps the best women's sprinter ever.
</P>
<P>
"I sit and think about being mentioned in the same breath as
Florence and Jesse Owens," said Jones said. "Now, I plan to be in
track and field for as long it takes to go after Florence's
records and golds."
</P>
<P>
Griffith Joyner's world records in the 100 meters and 200
meters are 10.49 and 21.34 seconds respectively. Jones' best marks
are 10.65 and 21.62.

<P>
CAIRO, February 12 (Xinhua) -- One person was killed and 14
others injured on Friday in a road accident in eastern Egypt, the
Middle East News Agency (MENA) here reported.
</P>
<P>
The accident took place on the Zaafarana-Ras Ghareb Road on the
Red Sea coast when a tourist bus rammed a truck, killing the bus
driver and injuring 14 people, including 12 tourists, a source of
Egypt's Interior Ministry was quoted by MENA as saying.
</P>
<P>
Three of the wounded were in serious condition and have been
hospitalized, the source said.
</P>

</P>
<P>
Seventeen passengers, including 12 Russians and five Yugoslavs,
were on the bus owned by a Cairo-based tourist company when the
accident occurred.
</P>
<P>
Traffic accidents are common in Egypt as vehicles are often
driven at high speed and drivers impatient. In the past three
weeks, 43 people were killed and 75 others wounded in road
accidents.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 12 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is to
receive a 450 million Rand (75 million U.S. Dollars) grant from
the Swedish government over the next three years in terms of an
agreement signed by the two governments Friday.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, signed by Swedish Foreign Minister Anna Lindh
and South African Deputy Foreign Minister Aziz Pahad in Cape Town,
will provide funding for education, housing and economic
cooperation between the two countries, South African Press
Association reported.
</P>
<P>
It will also support the development of arts and culture and
democratic government in South Africa, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement also envisions the two countries working more
closely to eradicate poverty and promote human rights in the
southern African region.
</P>
<P>
Pahad said ties between South Africa and Sweden were excellent,
and the two countries would be working toward broadening their
relationship.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela would visit Sweden next
month, and it was hoped Swedish Prime Minister Goeran Persson
would visit South Africa later this year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Lindh said Sweden supported the further write-off of developing
 countries' debts and had written off most of what it was owed
from Africa.

<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan is present at the meeting,

Representatives from 14 countries, including China, are

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Calls for Technology Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Opening the Southern African Development Community (SADC)
consultative conference here Friday, the president noted that the
revolution in science and technology is moving our world from the
industrial age to a new era of information technology. In this
new era, where the Internet is endlessly expanding cyber space,
new and unlimited possibilities of development are emerging.
</P>
<P>
"We see a progressive shift from capital-intensive industries
to knowledge-intensive ones. Our duty is to capture the
knowledge, internalize it and use it to open up new frontiers of
development," the president said.
</P>
<P>
It is also through the new advances in science and technology
that production is shifting from low wage developing countries to
high wage developed countries. In this connection, availability of
cheap labor and dependence on the production and export of
commodities no longer offers a viable basis for the development of
our region, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I therefore, look forward to this conference coming up with a
dynamic strategy on information technology and knowledge
management that should promote the SADC program of work".
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Chiluba also required international cooperation
to promote transfer of science and technology to developing
countries. "Southern African can not fully benefit from the new
information technology if there is no supportive framework for
transfer of technology," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is about time that the question of science and technology
orientation, policy and change was placed high on the agenda of
international cooperation, the president added.

Culture Minister Gabriel Machinga Friday congratulated local
writer Yvonne Vera for winning the prestigious Sweden's Voice of
Africa Literary award.
</P>
<P>
Vera won the award for her latest book "Butterfly Burning"
which captures township life in the colonial era from as early as
the 1940s. The prize came with a 12,600-U.S. Dollar reward, the
Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>

Machinga said it was pleasing to note that Vera had once again
showed Zimbabweans and the entire world that her work was not just
good by local standards but that it could compete effectively
internationally.
</P>
<P>
By winning the award, Machinga said, Vera had demonstrated the
high level of literary expertise some of which lay untapped in
Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
He also hoped that her winning would go a long way to inspire
all future writers and those that were in the business of writing.
</P>
<P>
Machinga said he was delighted that Vera continued to project a
positive image of Zimbabwe on the international scene.
</P>
<P>
The widely acclaimed Bulawayo-born writer is the three-time
winner of the Zimbabwean Book Publishers Literary Award.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 she won the Commonwealth Literary Award for African
region for her book "Under The Tongue".
</P>
<P>

world, placing her among a galaxy of renowned writers like Nelson

<HEADLINE> UK Doctors Call for Mass Meningitis Vaccine Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- A group of British doctors
called Friday on children who enter primary school to be routinely
vaccinated against meningitis.
</P>
<P>
The call came as another south Wales school began mass
vaccinations against the brain disease. Two of the school's
sixth-formers were admitted to hospital with suspected meningitis
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The call for a mass vaccination program came as Y Pant School,
in Talbot Green, Mid Glamorgan, began treating about 1,000 pupils
and staff with antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
Britain is now seeing the highest number of meningitis cases
since the Second World War with three already died.
</P>
<P>
Dr Nigel Higson of the Primary Care Virology Group told BBC
Radio 4's Today program that countries like the U.S.A. and Spain
had a more radical program on meningitis vaccination.
</P>
<P>
"10,000 people carry meningitis for every one case. There is a
lot of disease in the community and we do not know which people
are carrying it," he said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, children are vaccinated against Hib meningitis, but
the main cause of the recent outbreaks has been meningococcal
meningitis.
</P>
<P>
Meningitis experts predict a new lifelong vaccine against the C
strain will be on the market in next few years.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese
diplomat on Friday told an open U.N. Security Council session that
"the ultimate way to protect civilians in armed conflict is to
effectively prevent and eliminate all armed conflicts."
</P>
<P>
Qin Huasun, Chinese permanent representative to the United
Nations, said that "The root cause for humanitarian crisis should
be wiped out through ethnic reconciliation, confidence building
measures, economic development and the maintenance of national
stability."
</P>
<P>
Qin made the remarks at the Council session, presided over by
Lloyd Axworthy, foreign minister of Canada, which holds the
presidency of the 15-member Security Council for the month of
February.
</P>
<P>
"Quite some regions in the world are still plagued by armed
conflict right now, which not only threatens the peace and
security in the region and the world at large, but also brings
severe damages to the people of the countries and regions
involved," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Civilians are subjected to forced deplacement and violent
assault," he said, "In particular, women and children, as one of
the most vulnerable social groups, are most gravely affected in
conflict situations." "This calls for full attention of the
international community," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that "We believe that no matter when and where conflict
breaks out, the parties involved should be urged to end it as soon
as possible through peaceful means, to abide by strictly the
various international laws, including the international
humanitarian law, to provide, as best they can, protection and
assistance to civilians, to prevent and forbid the various forms
of violent assault against civilians or attempts to obstruct the
provision of humanitarian assistance to civilians."
</P>
<P>
Also present at the meeting was U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan, who has attached great importance to manage and prevent
conflicts across the world, on the African continent in
particular.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's Matola City and
Portugal's Loures City have agreed to enhance cooperation in
education, health, culture, tourism, municipal administration and
economic development.
</P>
<P>
This was revealed Friday by Demetrio Alves, mayor of Loures,
when concluding his visit to Matola City in southern Mozambique,
the Mozambique News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the existing bilateral mechanism, he said, "we could
initiate more vigorous and lasting cooperation in the
above-mentioned fields."
</P>
<P>
Alves disclosed that his city will help Matola train teachers
in addition to providing various materials, including four
computers, 20 dust bins and two trucks, which will soon arrive in
Matola.
</P>
<P>
He announced that Loures will soon offer some music equipment
to Matola.
</P>
<P>
Loures and Matola became friendly cities in 1996. Thereafter,
goods worth about 500,000 U.S. Dollars have been donated to the
Mozambican city.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Germany Expects PKK Leader to Hand Himself over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The German government expects
that the leader of the Kurdish Workers party (PKK) Abdullah Ocalan
will hand himself over to police authorities in Germany, according
to a report of the German Press Agency.
</P>
<P>
The report, quoting the Germany news magazine "Der Spiegel"
which will be published next Monday, said that the leader of the
PKK, which is banned both in Turkey and in Germany, was desperate
because no European nations wanted to have him.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, 49, also feared that Turkish elite forces may track him
down and kidnap him.
</P>
<P>
German Federal Prosecutor Kay Nehm had no information that
Ocalan planned to hand himself over to German authorities, his
spokeswoman said in Karlsruhe. If Ocalan surfaced in Germany he
would be arrested, she said.
</P>
<P>
Last November Ocalan was detained by Italy's police on his
arrival at Rome airport on a German arrest warrant.
</P>
<P>
Since Germany, fearing politically motivated attacks at home,
disclaimed to ask for his extradition and Rome refused to hand him
over to Turkey, citing the existing death penalty there as reason,
he was allowed to leave Italy last month, and then his whereabouts
have been unknown.

"Willful invocation of Article VII of the Charter of the U.N.
and the use of force or the unilateral threat of the use of force
without the authorization of the Security Council against a
sovereign state in the thick of a humanitarian crisis, with no
consideration given to the specific causes of such crisis will
only complicate the matter and further intensify the conflict," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"In this connection, we hope that countries and organizations
concerned will stick strictly to the principles of the
international law and the U.N. Charter, and respect, in real
earnest, the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political
independence of all countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We call for the elimination of double standards in the
humanitarian field," he said, "The international community should
give equal attention to incidents in all corners of the world
involving civilian losses in armed conflict."
</P>
<P>
The situation in Africa has been very troubling in recent
years, he said, adding that at some places in the region, crisis
are building up, while at others, old conflicts are rekindled.
</P>
<P>
"Civilians, especially women and children, are put through
agonizing pains and sufferings," he said. "The international
community should take necessary steps to support the efforts of
African countries and organizations in solving their hot-spot
issues, and to provide meaningful and effective assistance to help
keep civilians out of harm's way."
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese Government has always paid much attention to the
matter of protection of civilians in armed conflict and
participated actively in deliberations of this matter in the
General Assembly and other related organs," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council convened an open discussion on how to
protect civilians in armed conflict. U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan was present at the session, presided over by Lloyd Axworthy,
foreign minister of Canada, who holds the presidency of the
15-nation Security Council for the month of February.

<HEADLINE> Study Links Male Schizophrenia to Pregnancies Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- A new study has produced
evidence of a link between pregnancy and childbirth complications
and the later development of schizophrenia in young men.
</P>
<P>
Christina Hultman from the University of Uppsala, Sweden, and
colleagues from Europe and Japan found that early onset of
schizophrenia is associated with bleeding during pregnancy, and
small size for gestational age.
</P>
<P>
Their findings, published Friday in the British Medical
Journal, also showed that males whose mothers have had at least
three previous children may be at greater risk of developing the
condition.
</P>
<P>
The research examined information on children born from 1973 to
1979. It compared data from the Swedish birth register with
patients who were admitted to hospital for treatment of
schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
Reduced placental function may subtly impair foetal brain
development, leaving the individual more vulnerable to later
schizophrenia, the researchers suggested.
The link is weaker for female children, they said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Tests S-400 Air Defense System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Friday that it
successfully tested its latest S-400 air defense system at the
Kapustin Yar site in the country's northern Arkhangelsk region.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax reported that the launched rocket reached its
target. The test launches, conducted in a closed circuit,
indicated that they involved all the technical capabilities of the
system, including target spotting and missile homing.
</P>
<P>
However, Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev, who attended the test,
said it is still premature to assess the system's capability.
</P>
<P>
"No conclusions can be made now because government testing has
not begun," he said, adding that his ministry will continue
investing in the system.
</P>
<P>
Russian Air Force Commander Anatoly Kornukov said the missile
system is 85 percent operational.
</P>
<P>
"This is a preliminary test. A lot still needs to be done to
bring this missile system to the required standard, so it can spot
and destroy any of the presently-available means of air attack in
the range of 300-400 kilometers," Kornukov said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. NationWide Poverty Rate Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Some 13.8 percent of
Americans lived in poverty in 1995, lower than the 15.1 percent
recorded in 1993, the Census Bureau reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Poverty dropped in every state except Hawaii, Idaho and Montana
between 1993 and 1995, according to the Census Bureau.
</P>
<P>
However, the poverty rates varied from state to state.
Mississippi retained the dubious honor of poorest state in the
nation, with 21.4 percent of its inhabitants living in poverty,
while New Hampshire remained the state with the smallest poor
population -- just 6.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
A family of four was considered poor if its annual income was
below 15,569 U.S. dollars in 1995. For a family of three, it was
12,158 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The report also examined median income levels, which rose in
every state between 1993 and 1995 as expected because the figures
were not adjusted for inflation. Nationally, the typical family
earned 34,076 dollars in 1995, but that alos ranged considerably
across the country -- from 25,354 dollars in West Virginia to
44,345 dollars in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
The variations are explained by a variety of factors, including
the economic conditions in each state, the types of industry and
demographics such as the proportion of single-parent households,
experts said.
</P>
<P>
Each year, some $20 billion in federal money is allocated based
on the poverty rates in each county.
</P>
<P>
The Census Bureau updates its estimates every few years, rather
than waiting for the official census every 10 years. Each estimate
is based on a three-year average, meaning the 1995 figures
represented the 1994-1996 average.

<HEADLINE> Ghana, Cuba Seal New Trade Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Ghana and Cuba Friday signed a
new trade agreement that replaces a 16-year-old barter trade
protocol between them, giving way to free market transactions with
payments in convertible currency.
</P>
<P>
The agreement places emphasis on the active participation of
private sector operators with minimal direct state involvement,
Ghana News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Ghana's Trade and Industry Minister John Frank Abu and Cuban
Minister of Foreign Trade and Industry Ricardo Cabrisas Ruiz,
initialed on behalf of their respective countries.
</P>
<P>
Ruiz arrived in Accra, the capital, Thursday night for a
three-day visit to discuss with Ghanaian government officials how
Cuba and Ghana could intensify their cooperation in all sectors of
the economy, particularly trade, in the new world trade order.
</P>
<P>
Until recently trade exchanges between Ghana and Cuba were
carried out through the barter system with Ghana exporting log,
sawn timber, cocoa beans, aluminium products, toilet soap and
cooking oil in exchange for refined and raw sugar, medical
equipment and pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
There are about 1,000 Cuban professionals in Ghana assisting
with the health delivery and agriculture sectors in the rural
areas under a special exchange program.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, Ghanaian Foreign Minister Victor Gbeho said
that his country has no intention to observe trade sanctions on
Cuba imposed by the United States some 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
He said such a sanction is meant to stifle Third World
countries in the fast developing world economy and ''we have no
intention to be part of it.''
</P>
<P>
Gbeho said this when Ruiz paid a courtesy call on him. Gbeho
referred to the U.S. trade embargo on Cuba and said the action has
 not been approved by the United Nations and is therefore not
binding on other countries.

<HEADLINE> Heavy Snowfalls Hit Eastern Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Heavy snowfalls in Eastern Europe
Friday cut off many villages from the outside world and caused
chaos on roads, reports of media here said.
</P>
<P>
In eastern Slovakia, the army was called in to rescue villagers
trapped by the snowfalls. Many roads in eastern and central
Slovakia were blocked by stranded buses and trucks. Rail services
were also partly disrupted.
</P>
<P>
The snowfalls also caused power cuts and prompted a run on
shops are people started hoarding food stocks. Many schools
remained closed.
</P>
<P>
In Ukraine, heavy snowfalls severed electricity supplies to
more than 130 mountain villages. Three houses collapsed and many
others were buried by avalanches in the Carpathian mountains.
</P>
<P>
Some 500 cars were stuck in traffic jams on mountain roads,
while a number of remote winter resorts were inaccessible, reports
said.
</P>
<P>
Mountain passes to neighboring Hungary, Romania and Slovakia
were closed. Up to 7,000 police and troops were involved in rescue
operations in the region.
</P>
<P>
Poland was also in the grip of a cold spell with heavy
snowfalls. The region around the city of Cracow was worst hit.
</P>
<P>
Although in eastern Austria, fresh snowfalls caused numerous
road accidents, the situation in most western European nations
improved.
</P>
<P>
But in the French and Swiss Alps, there was still a danger of
avalanches. And in Germany, the motoring organization ADAC warned
drivers about possible traffic jams on motorways as weather
forecasters predicted more snowfall in the south and icy
temperatures with sunny skies in the north for this weekend.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Seeks Palestine-Jordan Confederation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) Chairman Yasser Arafat said Friday that he is
ready to form a political confederation between Jordan and a
future Palestinian state, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
In an address to a mass rally of Fatah supporters in the West
Bank city of Hebron, Arafat noted that the Palestinian National
Council (PNC), the top Palestinian leadership organization, had a
decision to forge a confederation entity with Jordan.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to a decision made by the PNC in 1985, which
was considered and then rejected by Jordan's late King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Historically and geographically, the Palestinians and the
Jordanians are closely bonded. Arafat described the two peoples as
"twin brothers," the radio said.
</P>
<P>
But analysts say that Hussein rejected the idea of
confederation for fear of instability in his kingdom, the majority
of whose population are Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted Jordanian officials as saying that Jordan's
new ruler, King Abdullah, will follow his father's policy
regarding the country's relations with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In response to Arafat's surprising declaration, David
Bar-Illan, media advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, said that a confederation does not remove the danger
of a unilaterally-declared Palestinian state, which Israel
strongly opposes.
</P>
<P>
He said such a political unity might also forge alliances with
countries hostile to Israel, such as Iran and Iraq. The prospect
of such an anti-Israeli alliance is one of the deepest concerns
Israel has over a future Palestinian state.

<HEADLINE> Schroeder Appeals for Solution to Metalworkers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, February 12 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder, issued on Friday an appeal to employers and workers in
the key metalworking sector to "sit down together and agree on an
economically justifiable result".
</P>
<P>
In an appeal before the weekend consultations of the
metalworkers union IG MetalL on whether to hold a vote for
possible strike action, Schroeder expressed his alarm about a
possible labor conflict at a time when he had "increasing concern"
about the German economy.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder was in Stuttgart on Friday for a visit to the
Daimler-Chrysler company, but issued a written appeal to IG Metall
boss Klaus Zwickel and the employers association Gesamtmetall boss
Werner Stumpfe.
</P>
<P>
Stumpfe reportedly replied that the employers would go into
proposed mediation talks without any preconditions and would seek
to help such talks proceed "constructively and quickly".
</P>
<P>
But Dieter Schulte, chairman of the German Trade Union
Federation, warned the employers against seeking wage mediation
purely for "tactical purposes...If this is only a trick, then the
situation would get worse."
</P>
<P>
The wage dispute, so far unresolved in a series of negotiations
in various regions, pits IG Metall's demands for a 6.5 percent
wage hike for the country's 3.5 million metalworkers, as against
employers' offer of a 2.3 per cent increase.
</P>
<P>
IG Metall's executive board, to meet over the weekend in
Frankfurt, will have to decide whether to call for a vote among
the union's rank-and-filelte members for all-out strike action.
</P>
<P>
Under current plans, the vote would take place February 22-24,
and 75 percent approval is needed for any strike action.
</P>
<P>
The last major IG Metall-organized strike came in 1995, chiefly
hitting industries in the state of Bavaria before a wage
settlement was reached.

<P>
The report quoted State Radio as saying that the city, captured

A regional security source also dismissed the government claim,
saying that to his knowledge the government forces had not yet
entered Mbanza Congo, which is located along a direct route to
Soyo where 20,000 barrels of crude oil are produced daily and
several foreign oil firms are based.
</P>

<HEADLINE> (UPDATE) U.S. Senate Fails to Pass First Impeachment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Senate on Friday
voted 45-55 to reject the first impeachment article of perjury
against President Bill Clinton in the final day of the Senate
trial.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went to trial in the Senate on January 7, is
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in two articles
of impeachment in connection with his relationship with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
But the Senate acquitted the president by 55 pros and 45 cons,
with 10 Republicans joining all 45 Senate Democrats in
acquittal.
</P>
<P>
"Not guilty as charged," Chief Justice William Rehnquist
declared.
</P>
<P>
A smaller margin was expected to reject a second article of
impeachment charging Clinton with obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
Both charges would have required 67 votes for conviction, a
threshold that senators have known for weeks would not be met.
</P>
<P>
"Senators, how say you? Is respondent William Jefferson
Clinton guilty or not guilt?" Rehnquist said to a hushed
chamber, beginning the vote.
</P>
<P>
One by one, senators rose from their seats and declared
"guilty" or "not guilty".
</P>
<P>
The Republicans who voted against conviction on perjury
were: Slade Gorton of Washington, Susan Collins and Olympia
Snowe of Maine, John Chafee of Rhode Island, James Jeffords of
Vermont, Richard Shelby of Alabama, Arlen Specter of
Pennsylvania, Ted Stevens of Alaska, Fred Thompson of Tennessee
and John Warner of Virginia.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was in the White House residence during the vote.
Aides said he did not watch on television. The final votes were
broadcast by the networks to a nation long since weary of the
proceedings.

<HEADLINE> UK's Male Suicide Rates Increase Markedly in 20 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Over the past 20 years, suicide
rates for young men in England and Wales increased by 83 percent,
whereas rates for young women declined by 11 percent, British
scientists reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The reason behind the disparity could be that women's favored
method of killing themselves has become less deadly over that
period, Dr David Gunnell, of the University of Bristol, and
colleagues said in a letter to The Lancet medical journal.
</P>
<P>
Young women could be just as likely to attempt suicide as men,
just less likely to succeed, their new research suggested.
</P>
<P>
The researchers studied the methods of suicides used by 15-34
year-olds in England and Wales using the data from the Office of
National Statistics.
</P>
<P>
They found that in women, rates of suicide from overdose in
1993-95 were 36 percent lower than the rates in 1968-70, while in
young men overdose suicide rates have changed little.
</P>
<P>
They also found that suicide by hanging increased by 339
percent in men and by 191 percent in women, while suicide by
drowning decreased by 30 percent in men and 34 percent in women.
</P>
<P>
Suicide by other methods increased by 89 percent and 56
percent, according to their research.
</P>
<P>
The authors concluded by calling for a broadening of mental
health strategies to target British women as well as men.
</P>
<P>
"Current concern with the mental health of young men should be
broadened to include all young people", they said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Azerbaijan to Quit CIS Security Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Azerbaijan will not extend its
participation in the CIS Collective Security Treaty, which expires
later this year, Interfax reported Friday, quoting a high-ranking
diplomat in Baku, the Azeri capital.
</P>
<P>
The diplomat said the Azeri delegation will take this position
at the CIS summit scheduled for the end of February.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the negative attitude to the treaty to the
Armenian-Azeri conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh.
</P>
<P>
"Withdrawal from the treaty will be Baku's reply to the
Armenian occupation of 20 percent of Azeri territory and Russian
deliveries of S-300 missiles and MiG-29 aircraft to Armenia," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"Baku fears that the Kremlin will use the treaty as a rigid
structure for restoring its old geopolitical sphere of
monopolistic influence," the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
Russia has repeatedly said that its military cooperation was
conducted in accordance with bilateral accords and was not
targetting any third countries.
</P>
<P>
Azerbaijan was the second member of the pact to indicate its
intention to quit the treaty after Uzbekistan in a major blow to
the integration of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).
</P>
<P>
Tashkent does not consider expedient further membership in the
regional security alliance, Interfax quoted a high-ranking source
in the Uzbek Foreign Ministry as saying earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, which was signed in Tashkent on May 15, 1992, by
Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan, is due to expire in
April this year. Belarus, Azerbaijan and Georgia joined the pact
later.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, which came into effect in 1994 when it was ratified
by all the signatory countries, stipulates that the member states
may withdraw from it upon the expiration of a five-year term.
</P>
<P>
Georgia has also indicated its reservation over the treaty,
demanding major revisions.

<HEADLINE> Serb President Accuses Western Powers of Playing Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The president of the Republic of
Serbia Milan Milutinovic accused on Friday the Western powers of
playing games in the talks on Kosovo in Ramboillet southwest of
Paris.
</P>
<P>
He said that over the past six days since the talks began,
there has been no direct meeting between the Serb delegation and
the ethnic Albanian delegation, because the international
mediators deliberately prevented them to meet each other.
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately here in Rambouillet there is no dialogue," said
Milutinovic at a press conference in Paris. "It's quite natural
then to ask what was the purpose of coming to Rambouillet in the
first place."
</P>
<P>
Entering a critical stage, the talks on Kosovo remain
deadlocked as the ethnic Albanians refuse to sign a 10-point peace
plan presented by the Contact Group, which guarantees the
integrity of the Yugoslav border.
</P>
<P>
The Albanians want to hold a self-determination referendum at
the end of a three-year interim period and want the NATO to
participate in the process.
</P>
<P>
The Serb delegation wants the Albanians to sign the Contact
Group peace proposal as a precondition to engage in full talks.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook, who is one of the
co-chairmen of the Kosovo talks, Thursday held Serbs responsible
for the deadlock in Rambouillet.
</P>
<P>
But Milutinovic said that the opposite is true, as the
Albanians don't want to talk.
</P>
<P>
"They (Western countries) want to expose us... They are
protecting them (Albanians) and attacking us," he said.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic also warned that Yugoslavia would stage guerrilla
style war against the NATO for years if the military alliance
launched air strikes in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We have never given into pressure in our history. Whatever has
happened we have always fought," he said.
</P>
<P>
NATO countries, especially the United States, have threatened
to launch air strikes against Serb forces in Kosovo if the peace
talks in France fail.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot believe that they want to have a Vietnam in Europe.
That would mean blood up to the knees," said the Serb president,
adding that the Yugoslav government is taking seriously the threat
by NATO.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers of the six-nation Contact Group will meet
on Sunday in Paris to discuss whether to extend the talks for
another week.
</P>
<P>
The Western nations have given February 20 as the ultimate
deadline for the two sides in conflict in Kosovo to accept their
peace proposal.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Mir Station May Cease to Exist in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 12 (Xinhua) -- A leading Russian cosmonaut
said Friday that the Mir space station may cease to exist late
August, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The mission of the Russian-French-Slovak crew to Mir which
starts on February 20 may become conclusive, said crew commander
Viktor Afanasyev.
</P>
<P>
He said flight supervisors have given the crew instructions on
its possible moves to close the station down.
</P>
<P>
In that case, the cosmonauts will leave the station and return
to Earth on August 23. Five days later, the Progress M cargo ship
will slow Mir down and take it away from the orbit.
</P>
<P>
However, Afanasyev still hopes that investments could be found
to finance more crew to Mir, which he believes "is still in a
satisfactory condition."
</P>
<P>
Afanasyev's remarks were apparently in contradiction with a
government resolution issued last month extending for three more
years the service of Mir, which was originally scheduled to be
shut down next Summer.
</P>
<P>
Under the document signed by Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov,
the space station will remain in orbit until 2002, and all phases
of the Mir flight, including its exit from orbit, would be
financed with budget money starting in the second half of 1999,
Tass reported, quoting the Governmental Information Department.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Acquitted of Perjury, Obstruction of Justice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Senate on Friday ended
an impeachment trial against President Bill Clinton and declared
acquittal of his perjury and obstruction of justice, thus ending
a 13-month drama starting by disclosure of the president's
relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
The vote allows the 42nd president to finish his term in
office.
</P>
<P>
"It is therefore ordered and adjudged that William Jefferson
Clinton be and hereby is acquitted of the charges in the said
articles," Chief Justice William Rehnquist declared.
</P>
<P>
Senators voted 50-50 on the impeachment article accusing
Clinton of obstruction of justice, far short of the two-thirds
required for conviction. Earlier, senators rejected the charge
of perjury by a 55-45 vote, as 10 Republicans joined the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
Both Charges would have required 67 votes for conviction, a
threshold that senators have known for weeks would not be met.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was in the White House residence during the vote.
Aides said he did not watch on television.
</P>
<P>
Eager to get beyond the impeachment crisis that paralyzed the
capital for a year, the president was prepared to make a
statement about an hour after the verdict, though he wasn't
saying whether it would be on paper or in person. After that he
will leave on Sunday for a trip to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The final votes were broadcast by the networks to a nation
long since weary of the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
Senate chamber doors, mostly closed for the last four days,
were opened for a final vote shortly after noon EST, ending a
fifth week of the trial.
</P>
<P>
Before the votes were taken, the articles of impeachment were
read for a final time. Senate Majority leader Trent Lott
declared it was time for senators to fulfill their "obligation
under the Constitution."
</P>
<P>
House prosecutors had hoped to attract support from most or
all the Senate's 55 Republicans, but their prospect had faded
even before the Senate voting.
</P>
<P>
Ten Republicans joined the Democrats in the first voting of
the impeachment article of perjury, while five Republicans
rejected the second impeachment of obstruction of justice.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Urged to Consider Israel's Security Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 12 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Joschka
Fisher on Friday urged Lebanon to take Israel's security demand
into consideration before a real peace in the border area between
the two countries could be achieved.
</P>
<P>
"Part of the solution to achieve peace is not only the
withdrawal of Israeli armed forces from the land of Lebanon, it is
also the security interests of Israel," Fisher told a news
conference after talks with Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss.
</P>
<P>
"We support the compliance of (United Nations) Resolution 425
but this is one thing. The other thing is to be wise and to see
the interests of all and everybody in the region," he added.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
In April last year, Israeli cabinet approved the 20-year-old
Resolution 425, which called for unconditional Israeli withdrawal
from Lebanon, but conditioned its implementation the Lebanese
government's guarantees for its north's security.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria, the main power broker with 35,000 troops
stationed in Lebanon, rejected the offer and asked Israeli troops
to leave the country without any conditions.
</P>
<P>
Israel accused Syria of holding south Lebanon as a bargaining
chip to seek a full Israeli withdrawal which also includes Syria's
Golan Heights, which Israel captured in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
The German minister, whose country currently holds the
six-month rotating presidency of the European Union, also held
talks with Lebanese President Emile Lahoud later in the day.
</P>
<P>
He was to leave here for Syria Friday evening to continue his
first Mideast tour which had taken him to Israel and Palestinian
self-rule areas.

<HEADLINE> MIGA Raises Ceilings for Political Risk Insurance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Multilateral Investment
Guarantee Agency (MIGA) announced on Friday a landmark increase in
the amount of political risk insurance coverage it may issue for
foreign direct investments in a project and host country.
</P>
<P>
MIGA's project limit more than doubled from 50 million U.S.
dollars to 110 million dollars, and its country limit increased
from 250 million dollars to 350 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Additional amounts of insurance coverage are also available
through MIGA's reinsurance and coinsurance arrangements with other
insurers, the MIGA said.
</P>
<P>
These increases will enable investors to obtain higher levels
of insurance coverage for their new investments in MIGA's 127
member developing countries.
</P>
<P>
MIGA's Executive Vice President Motomichi Ikawa noted that the
new project limit will enhance MIGA's ability to facilitate
investments that require significant amounts of insurance
coverage.
</P>
<P>
The new country limit is vital to host countries whose
outstanding exposures have been fast-approaching MIGA's allowable
limit.
</P>
<P>
MIGA, formed in 1988, is a member of the World Bank Group. Its
mandate is to encourage foreign direct investment in developing
countries by providing political risk insurance against transfer
restriction, expropriation, breach of contract, and war and civil
disturbance risks.
</P>
<P>
It also extends investment marketing services to developing
countries for more effective promotion of their private investment
opportunities.

<HEADLINE> (UPDATE) Clinton Acquited of Perjury, Obstruction of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Senate on Friday
rejected a censure vote on President Bill Clinton's relationship
with former White House intern Monica lewinsky, right after the
president was acquitted of two charges of perjury and
obstruction of Justice by two Senate's votings.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was raised by Senator Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif.,
who had recommended to censure Clinton for "shameful, reckless
and indefensible" behavior.
</P>
<P>
Her proposed censure, which Democrats may try to resurrect
after a mid-February recess, would rebuke Clinton for giving false
or misleading testimony and "impeding discovery of evidence in
judicial proceedings." The symbolic effort was a reminder that,
acquittal aside, Clinton remains forever tarnished as only the
second president in history to be impeached.
</P>
<P>
But it was amounting to almost a public show with nothing
damaged for Clinton's presidency.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Senate ended the impeachment trial against
President Bill Clinton and declared acquittal of his perjury and
obstruction of justice, thus ending a 13-month drama starting by
disclosure of the president's relationship with for White House
intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
The vote allows the 42nd president to finish his term in
office.
</P>
<P>
"It is therefore ordered and adjudged that William Jefferson
Clinton be and hereby is acquitted of the charges in the said
articles," Chief Justice William Rehnquist declared.
</P>
<P>
Senators voted 50-50 on the impeachment article accusing
Clinton of obstruction of justice, far short of the two-thirds
required for conviction. Earlier, senators rejected the charge
of perjury by a 55-45 vote, as 10 Republicans joined the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
Both Charges would have required 67 votes for conviction, a
threshold that senators have known for weeks would not be met.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was in the White House residence during the vote.
Aides said he did not watch on television.
</P>
<P>
Eager to get beyond the impeachment crisis that paralyzed the
capital for a year, the president was prepared to make a
statement about an hour after the verdict, though he wasn't
saying whether it would be on paper or in person. After that he
will leave on Sunday for a trip to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Ms. Lewinsky, who testified earlier this month by videotape,
watched on television, according to associates.
</P>
<P>
The final votes were broadcast by the networks to a nation
long since weary of the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
Senate chamber doors, mostly closed for the last four days,
were opened for a final vote shortly after noon EST, ending a
fifth week of the trial.
</P>
<P>
Before the votes were taken, the articles of impeachment were
read for a final time. Senate Majority leader Trent Lott
declared it was time for senators to fulfill their "obligation
under the Constitution."
</P>
<P>
House prosecutors had hoped to attract support from most or
all the Senate's 55 Republicans, but their prospect had faded
even before the Senate voting.
</P>
<P>
Ten Republicans joined the Democrats in the first voting of
the impeachment article of perjury, while five Republicans
rejected the second impeachment of obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
Henry Hyde, the lead House prosecutor, said after the votes
that his team had nothing to be ashamed of the defeat, rejecting
any idea that the Republican House's impeachment effort
tarnished its credibility despite public opposition.
</P>
<P>
"All Americans can take great comfort," the Illinois
Republican said. "Congress has strengthened, not weakened the
ties that bind our nation together."

<P>
BRUSSELS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- World Population is expected
to hit 6 billion later this year, United Nations Population Fund
told a five-day international conference which wound up in the
Dutch city of The Hague on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The UN fund said the world's population is due to reach 6
billion on October 12, 1999. Currently, the world population is
increasing at an annual rate of over 78 million, equivalent to the
population of France, Greece and Sweden combined, or a city the
size of San Francisco every three days.
</P>
<P>
The overall rate of population growth, presently 1.33 percent,
has begun to slow and if the current trend continues the world
population will rise to 10.7 billion by 2050, the UN fund said.
</P>
<P>
But the United Nations predicts that fertility rates will fall
faster, bringing the world population to 8.9 billion by 2050.

<P>
NAIROBI, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Tea crops in Kenya decreased
last week due to a continued dry spell while tea quality in
Malawi improved thanks to moderate rainfall and sunshine, a
leading tea brokerage house said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Mombasa-based Africa Tea Brokers (ATB) said it had been
hot, dry and windy in most of Kenya's tea-growing areas.
</P>
<P>
``Crop is dropping fast with some factories having to reduce
plucking rounds,'' said ATB.
</P>
<P>
Long rain season usually runs from March to May in Kenya's main
planting

regions.
</P>
<P>
In Malawi, ``widespread, often heavy, rainfall has now given
way to longer periods of sunshine interspersed with some showers
resulting in useful leaf intake with improved quality,'' ATB
said.

<HEADLINE> SADC Faces Challenges, Opportunities: Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a statement addressed in the opening ceremony of SADC
consultative conference Friday here, Alfred Nzo, Chairman for the
Council of Minister and South Africa Foreign Minister, said the
SADC's basic goal should be to broaden access to information and
communications technology as the one sure way to create new
opportunities for socio-economic development.
</P>
<P>
"As a region, we have been able to attain positive economic
growth for four consecutive years since 1995. Although most member
states registered positive growth rates, progress was particularly
noted in at least three countries, which on average, grew by more
than five percent in 1998. We are optimistic that the rate of
growth will accelerate to greater heights in the years ahead."
</P>
<P>
It is clear that the widespread economic reforms over the past
decade have contributed to the achievement and maintenance of
macro-economic stability and growth in most of the member states,
Nzo said.
</P>
<P>
He has invited the representatives of the business community
present at this conference to seriously consider investing in the
region.
</P>
<P>
On the theme for this consultative conference: SADC in the next
 Millennium-Opportunities and Challenges of Information
Technology, Nzo said, this conference is expected to deliberate on
possible strategies in this regard for the region, as well as find
a viable means to achieve such strategies.
</P>
<P>
"We will therefore be looking forward to the views of our
development partners on how to broaden access to information and
communications technology and thereby improve our region's
economic productivity and international competitiveness," he
added.

The Office of Ethiopian Government Spokesperson Selome Taddesse
said in a statement here that during Ethiopia's defense and
counter-offensive engagements at the two fronts, six enemy tanks
and three BM-21 rocket launchers were demolished, adding that
various heavy artillery and military warehouses were destroyed by
the Ethiopian army.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that Ethiopia published its six-day war
communique in fighting on the two fronts.
</P>
<P>
At the Badme-Sheraro front, the Office said, more than 4,000
Eritrean soldiers were killed and injured, and two tanks, three
BM-rocket launchers, heavy artillery and ammunition warehouses
were ravaged.
</P>
<P>
The Office claimed that over 3,000 Eritrean soldiers were

There were "only limited skirmishes occurring" on both
Badme-Sheraro and Tsorona fronts when the resumed fighting entered
its sixth day Thursday, according to the Office Thursday.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Urges to Protect Humanitarian Personnel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Steps and measures must
be taken to improve the safety and security of humanitarian
workers, UNICEF said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Security Council's opening debate on the
protection of civilians in armed conflict, Executive Director
Carol Bellamy said UNICEF and its partners on the ground struggle
daily with the task of gaining humanitarian access to endangered
civilian population, a struggle made all the more difficult as the
issue of access becomes political.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy said in recent years, UN staff have been increasingly
targeted for violent attack, murder and rape, and their right to
use communications systems for their own operations has been
denied.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy said all UN staff must be given proper training in how
to cope with the lawlessness and violence that awaits them.
</P>
<P>
UNICEF, together with other U.N. bodies, has invested heavily
in this area, such as development of an incident tracking system
that will be made available to member states and UN staff and
security awareness training programs to over 200 duty stations,
Bellamy said.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy stressed that these measures are only a beginning, and,
by themselves, they cannot begin to meet the security needs of the
30,000 UN staff members in the field.

<HEADLINE> UNICEF Urges Protection of Children in Armed Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The protection of
children in armed conflict must be framed by standards and norms
embodied in international human rights instruments and
humanitarian law, the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) said
here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Security Council's opening debate on the
protection of civilians in armed conflict, Executive Director of
UNICEF Carol Bellamy said over 300,000 children, girls as well as
boys, have participated as combatants in the 30 most recent
conflicts, and many of these children, some less than 10 years
old, have witnessed or taken part in acts of unspeakable violence,
often against their own families or communities.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy said in establishing 18 as a minimum age for
participation in United Nations peacekeeping operations, the U.N.
set an important precedent, one aimed at ensuring the highest
standard for the organization, and the U.N. recommended that this
policy serve as an example for police and military forces
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Bellamy said the reasons that give rise to children's
participation in armed conflicts are often the very causes of the
conflicts themselves: poverty, discrimination, displacement and
marginalization.
</P>
<P>
She said preventing the recruitment of children is as important
as demobilization, and both objectives require a long-term
commitment to education, to vocational training, attention to
psycho-social needs and to reunifying children with their
families.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, peace agreements and peacekeeping operations
must include full-fledged demobilization, programs specifically
designed for child soldiers, she said.
</P>
<P>
These must be aimed not only at reclaiming and destroying
weaponry, but with providing former child soldiers with material
benefits and vocational alternatives, she added.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Britain was the second biggest
exporter of services in the world after America in 1997, according
to latest figures by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).
</P>
<P>
A survey by the ONS showed Britain's worldwide exports jumped
from 82.7 billion U.S. dollars to 93.9 billion dollars in the
year.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that Britain has become increasingly reliant
on service sector earnings to pay its way abroad. Service sector
earnings have continued to rise since 1997.
</P>
<P>
Since 1970, average annual growth for services and
manufacturing has been 2.6 and 2.7 percent respectivedly. Services
account for about two-thirds of total economic output.
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter of last year, for example, services
generated a surplus of 5.44 billion dollars, the biggest quarterly
surplus on record.
</P>
<P>
The City remains the biggest generator of foreign earnings,
producing a net 9.92 billion dollars in 1997 from activities such
as banking and insurance.
</P>
<P>
The ONS's survey also showed other big earners in 1997 were
consultants, lawyers, computer experts, fashion, film, pop music
and advertisers.

<HEADLINE> Russia Voices Concern Over Armed Incidents in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry on
Friday expressed "mounting concern" over "the armed incidents in
the so-called no-fly zones in northern and southern areas of
Iraq."
</P>
<P>
It said in a statement that the sporadic airstrikes by U.S. and
British planes on Iraqi territory "are fraught not only with
serious political consequences but also -- which is absolutely
inadmissible -- with human casualties, including those civilian,"
Itar-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the creation of the no-fly zones was a
unilateral move taken without a sanction of the U.N. Security
council and therefore unacceptable from the point of view of the
international law.
</P>
<P>
"The references of the United States and Great Britain to
resolution 688 of the Security Council are absolutely wrongful,"
the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
It warned that U.S. and British attempt to instigate armed
uprisings against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein against the
background of systematic bombings "is a dangerous game fraught
with a threat to the preservation of the Iraqi statehood and a
disintegration of the country which can have unpredictable
consequences for the whole region."
</P>
<P>
Russia urged all sides to "show restraint and prevent a further
aggravation of the situation, primarily to stop the military
activity in the skies of Iraq."
</P>
<P>
"It is now important as never before to create a favorable
political atmosphere for further diplomatic efforts, primarily
within the framework of the Security Council, to agree on a
mutually acceptable platform for restoring the cooperation between
the U.N. and Iraq and lifting economic sanctions on that country,"
the statement said.

<HEADLINE> American Tourists Mugged in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 12 (Xinhua) -- A group of American
tourists had a bitter taste of South African crime when they were
robbed Friday in broad daylight by a 10-man gang armed with
knives.
</P>
<P>
The tourists were mugged while they were watching a play at a
pre-school in Mamelodi, Pretoria, South African Press Association
(SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The gang apparently broke up into two groups of five. One group
held up the driver of the tour bus around noon as he waited for
the party outside the pre-school.
</P>
<P>
The robbers took the driver's money and cell phone before
ransacking the bus and taking money, bags, passports and other
items which the tourists had left aboard, according to SAPA.
</P>
<P>
The other half of the gang, meanwhile, forced the tour guide
into a toilet in the school and robbed him before entering the
school hall and confronting the tourists as they sat in the
audience.
</P>
<P>
The play disrupted, the robbers forced the Americans to empty
their pockets and took money, jewelry, video and still cameras,
SAPA said.
</P>
<P>
The robbers ran away through the township.
</P>
<P>
The shaken tourists, most of them elderly, were then driven
back to their hotel in central Pretoria where police took
statements from them.
</P>
<P>
No one was hurt during the robbery, although several of the
victims were treated for shock.
</P>
<P>
The tourists were believed to be visiting the school under the
auspices of an American charity.
</P>
<P>
Police had not yet totaled the amount of money and value of the
goods taken in the robbery. Nobody has been arrested so far.

<HEADLINE> Genetic Food Prompts New Safety Fears in The UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Genetically-modified (GM) food
has caused new wave of fears in the UK Friday after scientists
renewed calls for the British government to impose immediately a
moratorium on the GM foods.
</P>
<P>
Twenty international scientists from 13 countries have issued
an unprecedented memorandum supporting the findings by British
scientist Arpad Pusztai, which found that rats fed on GM potatoes
suffered damaged organs and a weakened immune system.
</P>
<P>
Dr Arpad Pusztai was forced to retire from the Rowett Research
Institute in Aberdeen, Scotland, after making the claims in a
television program last August.
</P>
<P>
The institute said he had issued misleading information and had
been talking about the wrong potatoes.
</P>
<P>
However, the group of scientists, including toxicologists,
genetic engineers and medical experts, after re-examining Dr
Pusztai's work, said in the joint memorandum that his conclusions
were justified.
</P>
<P>
"We found that his data is sound", their spokesman, Dr Vyvyan
Howard, a toxipathologist at Britain's Liverpool University, told
the BBC.
</P>
<P>
The scientists called for further research to establish the
risks of allowing GM crops to be used in foodstuffs.
</P>
<P>
The latest findings have left British consumers confused in the
wake of some leading supermarkets deciding not to stock such goods
while others said to be happy to continue selling the produce if
they have clear labelling.
</P>
<P>
An opinion poll showed that 31 percent of Britons believe that
GM food poses a health risk to their families and 53 percent
wanted more statutory controls on them.
</P>
<P>
But the calls from consumer, environmental and food pressure
groups, have been rejected by the British government.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair has said the government will
not be holding a moratorium on GM foods despite the new outcry
over safety.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on a local radio interview, Mr Blair said: "There is
no more GM food that can be sold in this country without going
through a very long regulatory process.
</P>
<P>
"Let's proceed on the basis of genuine scientific analysis and
inquiry, proceed with very great care and caution and not get the
facts mixed up", he said.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Determined to Improve Electricity Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government is
determined to improve electricity supply in the country by
rehabilitating existing power stations, building new ones and
importing electricity from neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Minister of Power and Steel Mallam Bello said at a
press briefing here Friday that some 145 million U.S. Dollars
would be spent this year for the rehabilitation of six power
generating stations.
</P>
<P>
The rehabilitation would enable National Electric Power
Authority to reduce the recurring load shedding in the country
from April this year, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Another 156 million Dollars would be spent for the construction
of a double circuit transmission line from the Shiroro power
station in neighboring Niger State to Abuja, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Bello disclosed that a west African inter-connection project
involving Nigeria, Benin and Togo was being evolved to enable the
country to import electricity to offset shortfalls.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the project would include the construction of
a 330 kv transmission line from Ikeja in Lagos to the border
between Nigeria and Benin.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government, the minister said, has received
proposals for private sector participation in power generation,
including one from Mobil which intends to build a 350 mw thermal
power plant in the Bonny area of Rivers State, southeast Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Bello pointed out that the National Electric Power Authority
Decree was being amended to accommodate private sector
participation in this sector.
</P>
<P>
The most populous African country is critically faced with
shortage of electricity supply during the past several years,
seriously affecting the growth of its economy.

<HEADLINE> SADC Calls for Information Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a communique issued at the end of the two-day SADC
consultative conference held here, the regional grouping said the
world is experiencing an information revolution and that as SADC
stands on the dawn of the next millenium, the core of world
economy is becoming the creation of information, packaging into
services and the distribution of these services to the consumers.
</P>
<P>
The conference agreed that SADC should ensure that information
technology is accorded priority in terms of policy thrust and
resource allocation, according to the communique.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, SADC called on all stake-holders to work out
 strategies for implementing the conclusions and recommendations
endorsed by the conference to improve and broaden equitable access
to information and communications technology as a means of
creating new opportunities for socio-economic development in
southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
The communique called on international cooperating partners to
promote the transfer of science and technology to developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
It also said that this is dependent on SADC creating a
supportive framework to facilitate such technology transfer,
including the mobilization of internal resources for development.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the conference is "SADC in the next millenium:
opportunities and challenge of information theology"

<HEADLINE> APP Party Urged to Stop Alliance talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a joint letter to the APP Chairman, Senator Mahmud Waziri,
said that "we cannot in conscience accept by whatever name called,
which is intended to produce a presidential candidate from outside
the ranks of APP presidential candidates."
</P>
<P>
The two parties out of the three registered political parties
in the west African country have been working on producing a joint
candidate to improve their chances of defeating the People's
Democratic Party (PDP) which dominated the local and state
elections held in December and January.
</P>
<P>
But their plans have run into a storm of protest by APP
aspirants who saw the prospect of a joint presidential candidate
produced from the two parties as the end of their dream to become
the president of the country.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, the aspirants also effectively ruled out sharing
any platform with the AD, contending that "the vice-presidential
candidate should also be found and designated from among the ranks
of the party."
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC)
of Nigeria rejected the proposed alliance between the two parties,
saying that it runs counter to the relevant laws and electoral
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
However, some leaders of the two parties are still working on
producing a joint presidential candidate and their hopes dimmed
now as the six APP presidential candidate opposed the efforts for
alliance.

<HEADLINE> Brazil, Japan Charged With Dumping Steel in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government
announced on Friday that it has found evidence that Brazil and
Japan have illegally dumped steel in the United States at up to 70
percent below normal prices.
</P>
<P>
In a step that could lead to punitive tariffs on imported
steel, the Commerce Department made a preliminary finding that
producers from those countries sold steel in U.S. markets at
prices dramatically below production costs or home-market prices.
</P>
<P>
According to the Commerce Department, steel products from Japan
may have been sold at up to 67.59 percent below the fair value and
from Brazil at up to 71.02 percent.
</P>
<P>
The department also said that Brazil may have illegally
subsidized its producers, driving down the price of steel by up to
9.45 percent.
</P>
<P>
A ruling in an investigation into possible steel dumping by
Russia was delayed. The administration said it is continuing its
investigation into whether Russia dumped steel at unfair prices,
and plans to release findings next week.
</P>
<P>
The country's steel imports surged to record highs last year as
the Asian economic crisis reduced demand abroad and forced foreign
producers to seek U.S. outlets, often by selling goods at prices
below the prevailing U.S. levels.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. steel producers blame at least 10,000 layoffs and
three company bankruptcies on the import surge.
</P>
<P>
Before the punitive tariffs could be imposed, the Commerce
Department would have to make a final dumping determination by
late April and the U.S. International Trade Commission would have
to find, by mid-June, that the imports injure or threaten to hurt
U.S. steel industry.
</P>
<P>
There are already signs that steel imports dropped sharply in
December because of fears of retroactive tariffs from Japan and
Russia, and Friday's ruling could begin to lower imports from
Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that as the global economic troubles hit U.S.
companies harder, more industries -- including computer
chip-makers, machine tool companies, textile manufacturers and
automakers -- could also file dumping complaints seeking
protective tariffs.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Cypriot Town Hit by Strikes, Protests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Larnaca, a quiet coastal town
of Cyprus, has been hit by strikes of hotel and harbor workers
fearing losing jobs, and protests by officials and civilians
against the construction of a desalination plant.
</P>
<P>
Employees of the Golden Bay and Lordos Beach hotels have been
on strike for over two weeks in protest of managements' decision
to lay off 73 staff to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
A local court ruled on Tuesday that the strikers should not
block the entrances to the two hotels.
</P>
<P>
However, the unions warned that strike action would spread
across the entire country from next week if the dispute was not
resolved by then.
</P>
<P>
Zacharias Ioannides, manager of Hoteliers' Association,
condemned on Friday the union's decision to escalate the strike,
saying that a nationwide strike would be a serious blow to the
country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Another strike was staged by Larnaca harbor workers and
stevedores who are worried about the uncertain future of the port
as well as of their jobs.
</P>
<P>
After 13 days on strike, they continued to block the harbor
entrance on Friday, with negotiations at the Labour Ministry due
to resume next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' Labour Minister Andreas Moushouttas told reporters that
the unions wanted alternative works and compensation for the
surplus staff set to lose their jobs once the port is turned into
a leisure harbor.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Larnaca Mayor George Lycourgos on Wednesday led a
protest, blocking traffic at the airport roundabout, against the
construction of a desalination plant in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government last week awarded an Israeli
joint-venture the contract to build the Larnaca desalination plant.
</P>
<P>
Larnaca residents do not want the permanent desalination
plant, the island's second, to be so near. They say the area is
protected and frequented by tourists, and suggested moving the
plant to more "industrial" areas.
</P>
<P>
Protesters, including officials and civilians, drew up a
petition asking President Glafcos Clerides to intervene and put a
stop to the proposed plant in the protected Larnaca area.

ROME, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Some 50,000 Italians marched on
Saturday morning through the streets of Milan to protest against a
wave of killings since the start of the year.
</P>
<P>
Italian Social Solidarity Minister Livia Turco and the ruling
Left Democrat Party secretary Walter Veltroni were among the
political leaders taking part in the demonstration called by the
country's three powerful labor unions.

<HEADLINE> Panda Cub Well Loved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- An advertisement in the local
media and on the Internet seeking a name for a seven-month-old
giant panda cub has brought an overwhelming response from both
home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
In less than a week, the Shanghai Zoo where the male cub lives
received more than 500 suggestions including the names "Longer"
and "Sweet."
</P>
<P>
An Australian sent the name "Half-Half" through the Web,
explaining that "one half of the baby panda belongs to his mother
and the other half to his father, and he belongs to China and the
world. He links us all together."
</P>
<P>
This cub is very special. He is both one of a small number of
giant pandas naturally bred in captivity, and a crystallization of
unremitting efforts by many people.
</P>
<P>
The baby giant panda was born at a zoo in Chongqing in
southwest China, where its mother Xinxing lives, and was flown to
Shanghai, where the father Chuanchuan is, on January 26.
</P>
<P>
As the only giant panda at the Shanghai Zoo at that time,
Chuanchuan has been sent to Chongqing once a year since 1990, and
spent every mating season in February and March with Xinxing. The
couple have successfully produced seven cubs in a natural way,
four of whom have survived.
</P>
<P>
According to an agreement reached by the two zoos, the youngest
one was left in the mother's care until he grew strong enough to
move to Shanghai to be with his lonely father.
</P>
<P>
Yang Tinghui, a senior keeper with the Shanghai Zoo, was sent
to Chongqing two weeks in advance to become acquainted with the
baby prior to bringing him to Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
An air conditioned shed was been prepared, as well as a slide,
a rockery, rubber balls and some other toys, and four keepers took
turns looking after him round the clock for the first month.
</P>
<P>
The baby giant panda has easily adapted himself to the zoo,
Yang said, and he sleeps soundly and eats well, mostly milk,
calcium powder and bamboo leaves.
</P>
<P>
He plays with the rubber balls, climbs the iron railings, rolls
on the ground and goes up to the keeper to shake hands with her.
</P>
<P>
"The baby seems to know it is home," Yang said. "He's a real
lovely naughty kid."
</P>
<P>
Shi Xinquan, director of the Shanghai Zoo, said that a name
will be selected for him by March after consulting with animal
lovers and zoologists.
</P>
<P>
The giant panda is one of the world's most endangered species,
with only about 1,000 left in the wild, 80 percent in southwest
China's Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
Experts say these animals have a very low reproductive capacity,
and the female giant pandas become pregnant no more than once a
year and delivers one or two babies each time. Only 10 percent of
giant pandas are able to mate naturally.
</P>
<P>
China has tried many ways to increase the number of the species
and succeeded in breeding the first giant panda by artificial
insemination in 1963. Since then, 12 zoos and one animal reserve
worldwide have bred about 140 giant pandas, but the survival rate
has been a rather low 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, more zoos have joined hands in helping giant
pandas mate naturally. Early this month, the zoo in Lanzhou,
capital of northwest China's Gansu Province, introduced a female
giant panda to three males in Chengdu, capital of Sichuan, hoping
that a match will be made with one of them.

<HEADLINE> 4th ASEM Senior Officials Meeting on Trade, Investment Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The fourth ASEM Senior
Officials Meeting on Trade and Investment (SOMTI IV) ended
Saturday after a wide range of consultations and discussions,
SOMTI IV co-chairmen said.
</P>
<P>
Describing the meeting as "positive" and "fruitful", SOMTI IV
Co-chairman Finian Tan, deputy secretary of the Ministry of Trade
and Industry from Singapore, said at a press conference that
senior officials reached a number of agreements on proposals to
carry out the Trade Facilitation Action Plan (TFAP) and the
Investment Promotion Action Plan (IPAP) adopted by leaders at
Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) II in London last year.
</P>
<P>
Co-chairman Karun Kittisataporn, director-general of the
Department of Business Economics of the Ministry of Commerce from
Thailand, said SOMTI IV also endorsed recommendations regarding
Asia Europe Business Forum (AEBF) and exchanged views on
WTO-related issues such as the rise of protectionist pressure in
the wake of the financial crisis, the strengthening of the
Multilateral Trading System, and importance of pushing forward
broad-based negotiations and achieving universality of WTO
membership, Tan said
</P>
<P>
Tan also said senior officials discussed the global economic
developments, including issues such as the spreading of financial
turbulence worldwide, trade and investment ramifications of the
current economic and financial situation in the Asian countries
affected by the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The participants welcomed the substantial efforts made by these
countries to stabilize their economies and supported their efforts
to continue and deepen their economic reform measures, Tan added.
</P>
<P>
Tan finally said senior officials also expressed confidence
that these efforts, which have begun to create modest but
encouraging results, would lead to restoration of economic and
financial stability in Asia and create preconditions for growth in
Asia once again.
</P>
<P>
The SOMTI IV started on February 11 with attendance by senior
officials from all 26 ASEM partners.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials have agreed that SOMTI V would be held on July
7 to 8, 1999, in Brussels, Belgium, to be hosted by the European
Commission and the incoming presidency of the European Union,
Finland.

<HEADLINE> 12,000 Albanians Demonstrate in Rambouillet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RAMBOUILLET, France, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Some 12,000
Albanians demonstrated Saturday in Rambouillet in support of the
Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA), an Albanian separatist guerrilla
force in the Yugoslav province, said police sources.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators, waving banners in support of the KLA and the
red Albanian flag with the black double headed eagle, went through
the center of the town without disturbance while all the shops in
the town were closed.
</P>
<P>
The talks on Kosovo which began one week ago in Rambouillet, 50
kilometers southwest of Paris, are facing the risk of breakdown,
as both Serb and Albanian delegations have refused to make any
concessions.
</P>
<P>
About 5,000 Albanians gathered at a square in Rambouillet at
noon, but they were kept away from the chateau where closed-door
meetings were held by Serb and Albanian delegates along with three
international mediators.
</P>
<P>
Some of the demonstrators carried placards with the words "Free
Kosovo". Many of them wore traditional Albanian white caps.
</P>
<P>
The French government has reinforced the already substantial
police force in Rambouillet fearing an outbreak of violence.
</P>
<P>
Police were apparently taken by surprise by the large number of
demonstrators converging on the small town, as police intelligence
expected only 1,000 to 1,500 demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators came from all over Europe, especially Germany,
where a large Albanian community lives. Many others came from
Switzerland, Belgium and France.
</P>
<P>
The Center of Information on Kosovo for the European Union, an
Albanian group, said that some 500,000 Albanians living in Western
European countries originated from Kosovo.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The task force of the west
African peace-keeping force ECOMOG in Sierra Leone Saturday set up
a special garrison to protect capital Freetown, a report reaching
here said.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a statement issued by the task force as
saying that the new garrison, commanded by Colonel Buhari Musa,
will play a major role in implementing all ECOMOG security
arrangements for the defense of Freetown.
</P>
<P>
But "all operation in Sierra Leone will be directly controlled
from the ECOMOG headquarters", said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The change was ordered by overall ECOMOG Commander, General
Timothy Shelpidi, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG, which reinstated elected President of Sierra Leone
Ahmed Tejan Kabbah in March 1998, has cleared Freetown of the
rebels who infiltrated and almost took the city in January.
</P>
<P>
The regional peace-keeping force now has in Sierra Leone over
15,500 troops from neighboring countries including Nigeria,
Guinea, Ghana and Mali.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, an alliance of the Revolutionary United Front and
soldiers who toppled Kabbah in may 1997, remain active in the east
and the north of the tiny west African country, where they
reportedly hold diamond towns.

<HEADLINE> Factions in Mogadishu Ready to Talk: Italian Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Italian special envoy to
Somalia Francesco Sciortino has said that the rival sides of
Mogadishu are now ready to come to the negotiation table.
</P>
<P>
Sciortino, member of the Addis Ababa-based Standing Committee
for Somalia's Affairs, revealed this during his two-day visit to
Mogadishu for the assessment of a possible political settlement
for the differences among the various warlords contesting for the
top posts of the war-ravaged capital.
</P>
<P>
Sciortino, a former consular in the Italian Embassy in
Mogadishu before war, said at a press conference on Friday night
he now has new hopes that something can be done.
</P>
<P>
"To find a solution is not impossible as the gap is not very
large," Sciortino said, noting that bruises are now healed through
diplomatic shuttles in Nairobi and collaboration toward the common
good of Somalia is in hand.
</P>
<P>
Even though each of the opposing sides of the capital had
forwarded its political agenda and the way they would like to have
Mogadishu governed in written and verbal forms, he has now the
impression that a chance is being given the diplomatic option in
resolving the differences, said the Italian envoy.
</P>
<P>
The envoy has warned the Somalis should not lose this chance
when the international community is once again trying to help
Somalia by unifying the efforts of the countries involved in the
Somali affairs.
</P>
<P>
The envoy has met the traditional leaders, civic groups
including the local human rights organization, women groups and
Somali intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
Sciortino said they were focusing on Mogadishu where Somalia's
largest political crises now lies.
</P>
<P>
All talks were focused on the ways of ending the stalemated
political divergence over the administration of Mogadishu with
each group manifesting its desire to contribute to the solution to
the problem.
</P>
<P>
Sciortino who left for Nairobi Saturday will return to
Mogadishu in about 10 days with his pledges in helping the people
of Mogadishu to sort out their problems.
</P>
<P>
"The unification of the efforts of the outside players (the
countries involved in Somalia's affairs), a real study on
Somalia's problem and cessation of hostilities by the Somalis are
the only means of getting a lasting peace for Mogadishu and a
solution for the major part of Somalia's overall problems," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government, the European Union, the United Nations
and the international community as a whole can better help the
starving people of Somalia only if they reach a comprehensive
peace and understanding among themselves, he added.

WASHINGTON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. Senate acquitted President Bill Clinton on Friday
on charges that he committed perjury and obstruction of justice to
hide sexual indiscretions with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky, permitting the 42th president of the United States to
complete the remaining 708 days of his term.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. Commerce Department announced plans on Friday to
slap punitive duties ranging from 25 percent to 80 percent on
steel imported from Japan and Brazil, asserting that steelmakers
from those countries have been selling at unfairly low prices in
the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton plans to announce on Saturday that he will
send American troops to Kosovo as part of a peacekeeping force to
be formed if an agreement is reached by the warring parties,
Administration officials and diplomats said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
-- American Airlines was once again forced to cancel about half
its scheduled flights on Friday because of the labor dispute with
its pilots, creating chaos on the busiest travel day of the
Presidents' Day holiday weekend.

<HEADLINE> Canada, U.S. Discuss Nuclear-Missile Shield </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Canada and the United States
have started high-level discussions about a controversial proposal
to protect North America from nuclear attack by deploying a
ballistic-missile defense system across the continent, Canada's
Globe and Mail newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd Axworthy, considered a skeptic
on the issue, raised it in private talks on Thursday in Ottawa
with Strobe Talbott, the U.S. deputy secretary of state, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy also plans to visit the Colorado Springs, Colo.,
headquarters of the North American Aerospace Defense Command next
month for briefings on what role NORAD, a joint Canada-U.S. unit,
might be asked to play if such a system was ever deployed.
</P>
<P>
Many experts say that a system like the one envisioned by the
Pentagon -- a system to shoot down incoming rockets fired by some
states such as the Democratic People's Republic of Korea or
accidentally launched from Russia -- would require Canadian
participation, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Given the vast sums the U.S. military is spending on research
and development, Washington is going to be pushing for some signal
of co-operation from Canada, Canadian government sources said.
</P>
<P>
"We're going to have to come to some decisions over the future,
... which won't be easy for us," a senior Canadian official was
quoted by the newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Russian officials warn that the system would be the first step
in new nuclear arms race.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy is said by government sources to be very concerned
that the new proposal could undermine nuclear arms control
agreements.
</P>
<P>
Canadian and U.S. officials stressed that the talks are
preliminary because the United States is still several years away
from determining whether it could actually make a system work,
said the newspaper.

<HEADLINE> China's Non-Communist Party Leaders Stress Fight Against Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The fight against corruption
and improving education are some of the major topics that Chinese
non-Communist party leaders are proposing for government work in
1999.
</P>
<P>
He Luli, chairwoman of the Central Committee of the
Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, says that the
Communist Party's victory last year was unforgettable, but this
year the country needs a tougher fight against corruption among
officials. She hopes the government will take tougher measures
because of the wide-spread concern among the public.
</P>
<P>
She suggests that the government concentrate on reforms and
improving education, especially in rural area, where the number of
school dropouts is growing.
</P>
<P>
Ding Shisun, chairman of the Central Committee of the China
Democratic League, says that developing non-government backed
education programs should be given a higher position, and the most
important thing is drafting laws and regulations to encourage
private schools.
</P>
<P>
Wan Guoquan, the honorary chairman of the China Democratic
National Construction Association's Central Committee, says that
since China is becoming an aging society, the government must pay
attention to senior citizens and give retirement pensions to them
on time.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the National People's Congress this March, Premier Zhu
Rongji held two seminars to solicit opinions from non-Communist
party leaders and other figures.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ethnic Group Revives Its Language </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The language of the Tu ethnic
group is now popularly used by these people of northwest China.
</P>
<P>
China has 200,000 people of Tu nationality, most of whom live
in northwest China's Qinghai and Gansu provinces. In the past,
they mainly spoke the Chinese and Tibetan languages in daily life.
</P>
<P>
Li Keyu, a linguist of Tu nationality, revived the native
language of his people in 1979, and now many are eager to learn.
</P>
<P>
Shortly thereafter, the Qinghai Provincial Committee of
Nationality Affairs opened a language training center at the Huzhu
Autonomous County of the Tu Nationality. To date, 522 people have
graduated from the center and are enthusiastically popularizing
their own language.
</P>
<P>
Beginning in 1983, a campaign encouraging the study of the Tu
language was launched across Tu villages, and school children
began learning to read and write it in 1995.
</P>
<P>
To promote the spread of the Tu language, films have been
dubbed in Tu and many books have been translated into the native
tongue, all of which have been well received among the Tu people.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Dissident Osama Leaves Afghanistan: Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Saudi dissident Osama bin
Laden has left Afghanistan, a Taliban official confirmed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Syed Tayyab Agha, a Taliban official, told Xinhua from the
southern Afghan city of Kandahar, headquarters of the Taliban
militia, Saturday that they did not know where he had gone.
</P>
<P>
"We have not forced him to leave Afghanistan. But we do not
know where he is. Osama is not present at the place where he was
living, " Agha said.
</P>
<P>
Taliban sources quoted Osama as saying before leaving
Afghanistan "the decision to leave Afghanistan is my own, there is
no pressure from Taliban side on me to leave Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
"I do not want that the general Afghan people should undergo
more sufferings due to my presence in Afghanistan. I am thankful
to the Taliban support in my presence in Afghanistan," Osama
added.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi millionaire came in the late 1970s to fight along
with the Afghan Mujahideen (holy fighter) against the Soviet
forces. Osama left Afghanistan after the withdrawal of the Soviet
forces. He again came to Afghanistan in May, 1996 from Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Saeed Ur Rehman, chief Taliban representative based in
Islamabad told Xinhua Saturday evening that "he (Osama) might have
left Afghanistan due to the restrictions imposed on him by the
Taliban militia."
</P>
<P>
Reports from the Afghan capital of Kabul on Wednesday said that
the Taliban have banned Osama from receiving visitors or having
outside contact.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taliban Wednesday once again ruled out the
possibility of Osama's extradition, saying that such a demand was
illogical.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted a statement issued by the Taliban's supreme
leader Mulla Omar as saying that "Osama bin Laden no longer has
any facilities with him to communicate with any one."
</P>
<P>
Osama has been accused by the United States of masterminding
the bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last August.
The U.S. launched cruise missile attacks on the alleged terrorist
camps run by Osama in the Afghan province of Khost on August 20
last year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has been asking the Taliban to expel Osama from
Afghanistan or hand him over to the U.S., but the demand was
refused by the Taliban, saying that Osama is a guest of the Afghan
nation.

<HEADLINE> Pak, Indian Congressmen Call for Steps to Avoid Nuke Disaster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, February 13 (Xinhua) -- A two-day first ever
conference of Pakistani and Indian parliamentarians concluded here
Saturday, urging their governments to take all possible steps to
avoid an accidental nuclear catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
The conference, attended by some 100 lawmakers from the two
nations, issued a joint statement, underscoring the need for
efforts to achieve the goal of a weapon-free world.
</P>
<P>
"Governments should be asked to agree to a dialogue on nuclear
issue with intent of decreasing tensions and controlling an arms
race in the sub-continent," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
It said the on-going foreign secretary level dialogue between
Pakistan and India should be enhanced.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers applauded the upcoming visit by Indian Prime
Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee to Pakistan scheduled for February
20 to meet his Pakistani counterpart Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
The statement stressed the need for initiation of parliamentary
dialogue, saying a joint parliamentary committee should be formed
to promote contact between the two parliaments.
</P>
<P>
It also called for relaxation of visa for businessmen and
exchange of business delegations, cultural troupe, students,
magazines and newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the concluding session, head of the Indian
delegation Balram Jakhar said that the non-official meeting was
the beginning of a new era in Indo-Pak relations and should
continue.
</P>
<P>
He and his fellows will be looking forward to receiving their
Pakistani colleagues in New Delhi "in a month or two" for the next
session, said Jakhar.
</P>
<P>
Raza Kasuri, member of the Pakistani National Assembly, the
lower house, said parliamentarians of the two countries should not
depend on organizations like The News, a private Pakistani
English newspaper which sponsored the conference, adding such
meetings should be arranged by themselves at least twice a year.
</P>
<P>
Some 35 members from both houses of Indian parliament
representing major parties participated in the meeting with more
than 60 of their Pakistani counterparts.

<HEADLINE> Close Race for PDP's Nomination for Nigerian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Seven Presidential aspirants
will be vying for the nomination of the People's Democratic Party
(PDP) for party's flag bearer at its special national convention
schemed for Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Former Head of State General Olusegun Obasanjo and former
Vice-President Alex Ekwueme are said to be in very close race for
the nomination.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that if the alliance between the Alliance
for Democracy (AD) and the All People's Party (APP) fails, the PDP
flag bearer for the February 27 presidential election could become
the next president of the country's Fourth Republic.
</P>
<P>
The PDP dominated the local and state elections held last
December and January this year, and won more than 50 percent of
the votes cast throughout the west African country.
</P>
<P>
In what seems to be a war without guns, at least 160 retired
army officers including generals have lined up behind the two top
contenders of the PDP, according to a Saturday Punch report.
</P>
<P>
Leading the Obasanjo side are former military President General
Ibrahim Babangida, former Chief of Army Staff Lieut. General
Theophilus Danjuma, former National Security Adviser Lieut.
General Aliyu Mohammed Gusau and former military governors.
</P>
<P>
Former National Security Adviser General Gusau is Obasanjo's
point man in the North of the country, deploying enormous
resources in favor of Obasanjo's quest for the Fourth Republic
presidency.
</P>
<P>
Babangida's group has in the past five months mounted a
ferocious campaign within and outside the country to enhance
Obasanjo's ambition for presidency.
</P>
<P>
Behind Ekwueme are former military Vice-President Admiral
Augustus Aikhomu, former Adjutant General of Nigerian Army Major
General David Jemibewon, former Aviation Minister Air Vice-Marshal
Anthony Okpere and a host of others.
</P>
<P>
Ekwueme's support in military circles has mainly revolved
around Babangida's former deputy, Admiral Aikhomu, and Marshal
Okpere who has pledged to deploy all resources at Ekwueme's
disposal to ensure his success at the polls.
</P>
<P>
Both Obasanjo and Ekwueme have publicly acknowledged the
support being given them by the retired military officers.
</P>
<P>
As all seven aspirants of the PDP were summoned Friday night
before the party's clearing committee in capital Abuja for a
special interview, the committee was sharply divided into two when
it got to the turn of Obasanjo, according to one witness.
</P>
<P>
In the case of Obasanjo, some committee members argued that he
failed to deliver his ward and local government, and thus is
disqualified from the presidential race.
</P>
<P>
A decision adopted by the party's National Executive Committee
on November 26 last year says that any governorship or
presidential aspirant who failed to deliver his ward or local
government shall be disqualified from the race.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the South-south and South-east caucus of the party
has also written a letter to PDP National Chairman Chief Solomon
Lar and its National Executive Committee, drawing the party
leaders' attention to the decision.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Announces Progress on Lockerbie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 13 (Xinhua) -- South Africa Saturday
announced that progress was made on the issue of Lockerbie bombing
following a meeting between Libyan leader Muammar Qaddafi and
envoys from South Africa and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
"We are happy to be able to announce that positive results were
achieved in these discussions and that common understanding was
reached on all the outstanding issues on this matter," the South
African President's Office said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"This was made possible by the sincere cooperation of Colonel
Qaddafi who addressed letters in this regard to President Mandela
and the Saudi Royal House," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The contents of the letters were not disclosed in the
statement.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela's top aide, Jakes
Gerwel, and Saudi Prince Bandar Bin Abdullaziz met with Qaddafi on
the Lockerbie issue in Tripoli this week.
</P>
<P>
A report had been made to United Nations Secretary-General Kofi
Annan who mandated this initiative by Mandela and Saudi King Fahd,
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The bombing of an American airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland,
in 1988 killed 270 people on board and on the ground.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain have been seeking the trial of
two Libyan suspects, but Libya has refused to hand over the two
men as it could not reach agreement with the U.S. and Britain on
where the two Libyans should be jailed if they were found guilty.
</P>
<P>
As the latest effort to break the deadlock, Britain and the
U.S. Friday proposed that the U.N. could monitor the treatment of
the two Libyans while they serve their jail terms in Scotland.

PARIS, February 13 (Xinhua) -- A French navy ship on Saturday
evacuated members of an evaluation mission of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) from the insurgent Comoro island of Anjouan to
Moroni, capital of the Comoros.
</P>

The OAU mission was sent to Anjouan by some African countries
in the region early this week to evaluate the situation there and

</P>
<P>
Ministry sources said that the growing number of traffic

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Animal Exhibit Sparks Controversy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- A wave of controversy swept
Shanghai this week when seven rare animals were placed on exhibit
in a downtown shopping mall as part of a campaign ostensibly
promoting the protection of wild animals.
</P>
<P>
The obviously frightened and listless caged animals -- two six-
month-old Siberian tiger cubs, for six-month-old African lion cubs
and a one-year-old Cheetah -- were on exhibit in the gallery of
New World City, a busy shopping center in downtown Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Curious shoppers were charged 50 yuan for a photograph with the
animals.
</P>
<P>
"The animals are lovely, but pitiful," said one little girl
whose father voiced his opposition to the exhibit.
</P>
<P>
"Why should the animals be placed in cages and exhibited here
to publicize a protection campaign?" asked the father. "This
appears to be nothing more than a commercial venture."
</P>
<P>
However, a representative for the campaign sponsors said
allowing the general public to view the animals was designed to
promote an awareness of the need to protect wild animals, as well
as the ecology and environment.
</P>
<P>
"To protect wild animals, we must be close to them," said New
World general manager Xu Jiaping, adding the shopping center
provided a perfect venue for giving the general public a first
hand view of endangered species.
</P>
<P>
Reports indicate the animals were moved from the Shanghai
Wildlife Zoo on the evening of February 8.
</P>
<P>
Fei Zhenxian, deputy general manger of the zoo, said the
animals were fed fresh beef and chickens, with two staffers
closely monitoring their health at all times.
</P>
<P>
Du Decang, director of the Shanghai Wildlife Protection Center,
said unpredictable factors such as temperature, humidity, food and
air quality can adversely affect the health of animals and in some
cases may even be life threatening.
</P>
<P>
He said visits to zoos, media coverage and legislation provide
channels for enhancing public awareness of the need to protect
animals and the environment.
</P>
<P>
"Rare species such as Siberian tigers should not be exhibited
in a crowded shopping center," Du said.

<HEADLINE> Poverty Drives up to 15,000 Boys in Sex Trade in S.Lankan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Poverty and lack of education
and family care drive 10,000 to 15,000 Sri Lankan boy children
into the sex trade, a non-government organization revealed in a
latest report on sexually abused and exploited children.
</P>
<P>
The report, released by Protecting Environment and Children
Everywhere (PEACE), said that abuse from foreign paedophiles are
directed mostly at young boys although overall more girls are
abused than boys.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey carried out in the coastal areas, 85
percent of the children abused by foreign paedophiles are boys.
</P>
<P>
However, the local paedophiles outnumber foreign ones by many
thousands, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"It should be realized that for every foreign paedophiles there
would be many local collaborators who should be considered equally
guilty," Chairman of the Child Protection Authority Professor
Harendra de Silva was quoted in the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, severe poverty levels as well as lack
of education, care, supervision and concern are some of the main
causes that lead children to sexual abuse.
</P>
<P>
The rehabilitation programs to the sexually abused children
have not had much success. The reasons, the report noted, are that
the programs were not geared towards the needs of society and that
the vocational training given were not geared to job placements.
</P>
<P>
"Any solution to the problem of commercial sexual exploitation
of children must address the root cause such as poverty,
dysfunctioning in the family unit, broken homes, migration of
women abroad to seek employment and the advertising of Sri Lanka
as a haven for sexual exploitation," the report stressed.
</P>
<P>
Education and raising the awareness levels of the public about
the problem are cited by the report as means to help eliminate
child exploitation from the country.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Lifts Ban on Fuel Importation by Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
has lifted the ban on importation of fuel by road after laying
down tight security and tax control measures on such import, local
media reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Energy and Minerals, Abdallah Kigoda, told the
National Assembly in the central city of Dodoma Friday that the
ban has been lifted with immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
However, Kigoda cautioned local dealers not to misuse the
opportunity, warning that illegally imported fuel will be
confiscated.
</P>
<P>
The move was part of the government's initiatives to liberalize
fuel industry in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
The liberalization should not be considered as a chance to
cause chaos in the market and deny the state revenue, Kigoda said,
adding that smuggled fuel has affected fuel pricing system.
</P>
<P>
From now on, Kigoda said, his ministry will conduct surprise
checks on importers and those implicated with irregular activities
will have their licenses revoked.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that patrols will be tightened at all entry
points to ensure that every drop of oil imported complies with the
specified quality standards and is subjected to taxation.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the fuel traders to build a culture of operating
legally by observing laid-down ethics and regulations.
</P>
<P>
In May 1997, fuel dealers were allowed to import fuel through
neighboring Kenya, to cover an acute shortage of fuel,
particularly in Lake Victoria regions after transportation
difficulties caused by unusual rains linked to El Nino.
</P>
<P>
Until 1997 fuel trade in Tanzania was operated by foreign
companies. Domestic businessmen were limited to running petrol
stations only as agents.
</P>
<P>
But the dealers, who were licensed to operate for two years,
were discovered to engage in foul plays including evading taxes,
smuggling and adulterating oil products.
</P>
<P>
Such revelations forced the government to ban fuel imports by
road from Kenya's west town of Kisumu.

<HEADLINE> Famine-Hit Tanzania Bans Cereals in Brewery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 13 (Xinhua) - Tanzania has banned the
use of cereals in making brew as the country is suffering from a
critical food shortage.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye Friday told the National
Assembly in its 14th session in central city of Dodoma that he has
directed officials all over the country to ensure the limited
available food was used sparingly, local media reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier official reports said that Tanzania needs 600,000 tons
of food to relieve its people in more than half of the country
from an ever- worsening food shortage.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye told the parliament that the government has taken
precautionary measures against the shortages including waiving tax
on imports, insisting that the state's initiatives need public
support.
</P>
<P>
"The food shortage this time is serious and if we don't
cooperate, we will fail to feed our people," he told the House.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye directed food shortage and disaster committees at all
levels to make regular assessment of shortages and to supervise
the distribution of food available.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the unstable state of food in the country on
persistent drought and last year's El Nino-charged rains which
washed away crops in the field.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister urged his people to revive traditional
methods of preserving food right from the household level and get
rid of post-harvest losses.
</P>
<P>
He also challenged the Tanzanians to revolutionize agriculture
by using modern farming methods including irrigation farming to
assure themselves of adequate food supply.
</P>
<P>
"Quality seeds and farming inputs should also be distributed to
the farmers in time to boost agricultural production to avoid
begging for food handouts," he said.

PARIS, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers on Saturday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The acquittal of U.S. President Bill Clinton by the Congress
has turned a page of one year of scandal which marked the image of
the 42nd president of the United States. This has also given a
kick off to the presidential and legislative elections on November
5, 2000. The elections will be the last chance for Clinton to
restore his reputation tainted by Monicagate, as the president
sees the election of Vice President Al Gore to the White House as
his only chance of salvation.
</P>
<P>
-- The risk of a failure of the Kosovo talks in Rambouillet is
worrying Western countries, which will have a foreign ministers'
meeting on Sunday to evaluate the situation of the talks. The Serb
side has refused to accept a high degree self-rule for Kosovo and
the deployment of an international peacekeeping force, while the
ethnic Albanian insists on gaining independence for the province.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- With the acquittal by the Congress of charges of perjury and
blocking justice, U.S. President Bill Clinton will from now on
concentrate on preparing for the 2000 presidential and legislative
elections with the objective of letting Vice President Al Gore win
the presidency and the Democrats obtain a majority in the Congress.
</P>
<P>
-- After three years of relative calmness, crimes and
delinquencies again saw a notable growth in France in 1998. Police
reported 3,565,525 cases of crimes and delinquencies during the
whole year, which is 2.06 percent more than that of 1997.

</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton achieved the greatest triumph of
his turbulent political career on Friday when the Senate
decisively acquitted him, bringing down the curtain on a scandal
that had threatened to oust him from the White House.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Germany's finance ministry has warned that if the European
Central Bank fails to react to deteriorating economic conditions,
Europe's governments may have to adopt fiscal policy alternatives.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- British Prime Minister Tony Blair on Friday rejected calls
for a ban on genetically modified food after 20 international
scientists supported controversial findings that potatoes
engineered can damage the brains, immune systems and vital organs
of rats.
</P>
<P>
The Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- The Kosovo peace conference was close to collapsing on
Friday as the Serbs insisted they would not negotiate unless
ethnic Albanian Kosovars signed a contested declaration.

<HEADLINE> HK Govt Decision on Resuming Land Sales Welcomed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong government's
decision to resume land sales in April after a suspension of ten
months was welcomed by real estate agents, bankers and legislators.
</P>
<P>
They all described the decision as a good move to ensure
stability in Hong Kong's property market and provide sufficient
land to meet its long-term needs.
</P>
<P>
The government revealed that the land sales plan will be
achieved by introducing a modest Land Sale Program for 1999-2000,
coupled with a new "application system" whereby developers may
apply for sale of sites from a "reserve list".
</P>
<P>
Real estate agents said that the government's land sales
methods will be conducive to the readjustment of land supply in a
flexible way so as to meet the market's demands.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers quoted Li Ka-shing, chairman of the Cheung
Kong (Holdings), as saying that the government's decision "helps
to stabilize the property prices". The most important is that
people are able to make their home purchases, he added.
</P>
<P>
Bankers said that banks in Hong Kong have adequate funds to
offer loans to those who are in need.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Legislative Council agreed that the resumption
of land sales symbolizes a positive step the government has taken
to revive the economy and help stabilize land prices.
</P>
<P>
Rosanna Wong, chairman of the Housing Authority, said with
sufficient land the authority will be able to help meet the
government's housing production target.
</P>
<P>
"We are happy that 15 hectares of land will be available for
the Private Sector Participation Scheme in the coming year with an
estimated production of 14,700 flats. Another 27 hectares have
been set aside for the ensuring four years to 2004, with an
estimated production of 24,000 units," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said the authority is committed to public housing
production, and with the resumed land sales, the authority is
confident both that the 50,000 flat-a-year production target will
be met and that annual production will be more even than
previously.

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Keep MAS' Activity in Forex Market Opaque </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Lee, who is also MAS' chairman, made the remarks while speaking
at a dinner for members of the Economics Society of Singapore
Friday night.
</P>
<P>
In a wide-ranging speech on Singapore's economic management,
Lee said his country's monetary policy is centered on the
management of the Singapore dollar exchange rate rather than on
domestic interest rates.
</P>
<P>
"We have chosen the exchange rate as our policy variable,
because it has a more immediate and direct impact on prices and a
stronger effect on aggregate demand," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lee said MAS manages the Singapore dollar not against any
single currency but against a trade-weighted basket of currencies
of Singapore's main trading partners.
</P>
<P>
Affirming MAS' policy objective is price stability, Lee said
MAS sets a target band for the exchange rate and intervenes to
moderate exchange rate fluctuations and to guide the exchange rate
to the target band.
</P>
<P>
"MAS is, however, ready to intervene to repel speculation,
should it judge that the exchange rate has been pushed excessively
in direction that are not justified by fundamentals," he
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Lee believes that the present level of the Singapore dollar
exchange rate is "broadly appropriate for current economic
conditions and prospects."

<TEXT>
<P>
Domestic demand for meat, an indispensable part of the festival
menu, has been up sharply in advance of the traditional festival.
</P>
<P>
China faces a difficult task in preventing the spread of animal
diseases due to the adverse effects of last summer's record
flooding and unseasonably high winter temperatures.
</P>
<P>
A recent circular issued by the aforementioned departments
called for tighter supervision over the domestic meat market in
order to ensure Chinese citizens will enjoy a safe holiday season.
</P>
<P>
Meat distributors have been urged to strictly follow hygiene
standards for meat processing, transportation and marketing. The
circular also called for strict quarantine inspections of breeding
operations and slaughterhouses.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Garment Exports Show Sharp Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's garment exports
in 1998 increased by 66 percent as compared to 1997, making the
garment industry a leading exporter and employment provider in
Cambodia, according to the Ministry of Commerce.
</P>
<P>
The ministry's official Mak Pich Rith was quoted Saturday by
the Vision as saying that garment's exports in 1998 reached to
about 378 million U.S. dollars as compared with 227 million U.S.
dollars in 1997 and 79 million U.S. dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
He said that the sharp growth of garment exports should
attribute to the tremendously increase in garment factories.
Cambodia now has 139 garment factories while in 1997 it had just
70.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, this figure will increase even
further in 1999 as many factories under construction now started
production.
</P>
<P>
And "even now, more and more garment factories are making
applications to the Council for the Development of Cambodia (CDC)
for investment licenses and we are receiving a lot of inquiries
from prospective investors in this sector," Mak Pich Rith said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 378 million U.S. dollars in exports, an estimated 72
percent was to the United States while the rest was to Europe and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Most garment manufacturers were taking advantage of the
Generalized System of Preference (GSP) and most favored nation
(MFN) status offered by the United States to establish their
factories here.
</P>
<P>
Mak Pick Rith said that exports to the European Union will also
show significant increases in the future since there was no quota
to these countries, unlike the United States which imposed quotas
on 12 categories of Cambodian garments in January, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe, Namibia Urged to Use Ivory Proceeds in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe and Namibia should
divert the bulk of the money accruing from the experimental ivory
trade with Japan into effective elephant management programs and
effective anti-poaching activities, wildlife experts said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the decision by the Convention on International Trade
in Endangered Species (CITES) Standing Committee to allow Zimbabwe
and Namibia to engage in experimental ivory trade with Japan, the
experts said that the two countries should not get carried away as
many challenges lay ahead.
</P>
<P>
The Herald newspaper Saturday quoted Officer of the Africa
Resources Trust Project, Jon Hutton as saying that while the CITES
decision was just and would bring in immediate economic benefits,
Zimbabwe had to closely monitor its elephants and intensify
anti-poaching activities.
</P>
<P>
"I think it was a just decision, but it must be pointed out
that it is a decision which comes along with a lot of
responsibilities on all the countries involved," said Hutton.
</P>
<P>
There are concerns that any legal ivory trade would stimulate
illegal trade and increased poaching activities in Zambia and
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe and Namibia needed to take these issues into account,
since they are genuine concerns, Hutton said.
</P>
<P>
"It is essential that poaching is kept under control so that
there will be no suggestion that illegal trade is on the
increase," he said, adding that Zimbabwe now needs to quickly
dispose of its quota to Japan so that any illegal trade thereafter
would be detected.
</P>
<P>
Director with a Namibian non-governmental organization, Rossing
 Foundation Len le Roux said the CITES decision was well received
in his country, adding that proper management mechanisms, however,
needs to be put in place.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed as speculation the argument that limited ivory
trade would lead to increase poaching activities.
</P>
<P>
"It is particularly encouraging to communities in rural areas,
which over the years have been involved in wildlife management.
However, it is not going to be easy, as many challenges lie
ahead," Roux said.

<HEADLINE> 6,000 Cellphones Stolen Per Month in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Cellular phone theft has
reached epidemic proportions in South Africa, with 6,000 phones
being stolen each month, Saturday Star newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Police believe that there is a powerful international syndicate
behind the racket, rendering many of the normal safety measures
useless, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
To overcome "blacklisted" phones being disabled, police say
that the syndicate swops the phone's microchip, which provides the
phone's identity. The thieves are also said to ship the phones to
countries where blacklisting is ineffective.
</P>
<P>
But the police did not identify the suspected syndicate behind
the scene.
</P>
<P>
Both South Africa's cellphone operators, MTN and Vodacom, admit
that cellphone theft is a big problem for them.
</P>
<P>
According to MTN's group executive of corporate relations,
Jacques Sellschop, more than 60 percent of the stolen cellphones
on MTN's network are never used again on its network.
</P>
<P>
This, he explained, means they are either being sent out of the
country, or their "cellular fingerprint" is somehow changed so
that the phone is no longer recognizable.
</P>
<P>
To curb this criminal activity, Sellschop called on the
government to urgently bring in legislation to make it illegal for
people to tamper with cellphones or change a phone's identity
number on the microchip.
</P>
<P>
However, he said: "At the moment, the police can't arrest
someone they catch changing the microchip."

<HEADLINE> Non-Performing Loans Stand 1.3 Billion Dollars in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Total outstanding
non-performing loans in Kenya's banking industry stood 80 billion
Shillings (around 1.3 billion U.S. Dollars) at the end of 1998,
according to the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK).
</P>
<P>
Micah Cheserem, CBK's governor, said the trend, which accounted
for 30 percent of the banking industry, was alarming and must
immediately be addressed, as he was quoted by local media as
saying Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the banks to reduce the level of non-performing
loans , adding that 1999 has ushered in an era of stiff
competition in banking industry where spreads between deposit and
lending rates would narrow dramatically.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launching of the first credit reference bureau
in Kenya Friday, the Governor further advised the banking
institutions to engage the services of rating agencies in order
to avoid accumulated bad debts.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the credit bureau would facilitate lenders in the
banking industry to countercheck the credit worthiness of
potential borrowers, but warned that it is not a substitute for a
sound credit management system.
</P>
<P>
"This will avoid the present situation where the same loan
defaulter has so many unserviced loans in different
institutions," Cheserem said.
</P>
<P>
The new bureau's Manager Director Steve Mills said that it took
nine years for his bureau to build the system's data base of more
than four million files.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Keen on Improving Ties With Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's new king Abdullah Bin
Hussein has expressed his keenness on improving bilateral ties
with Syria, which had been soured since 1994.
</P>
<P>
In a congratulation message to Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
on his re-election carried by the semi-official Jordan Times
Saturday, Abdullah expressed Jordan's keen interests in
strengthening ties with Syria in all aspects.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian parliament named Assad, 68, for a fifth seven-year
term in office on Thursday after he overwhelmingly won a national
referendum as the sole presidential candidate on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After his reelection, Abdullah had telephone conversations with
Assad and the two leaders discussed means of enhancing bilateral
ties, which had been cool since 1994, when then Jordanian King
Hussein signed a peace treaty with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Technically, Syria is still at war with the Jewish state and
the two countries frequently exchange fire at the strategically
situated Golan Heights, which are still under Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
In his first visit to Jordan since 1994, Assad arrived in Amman
on Monday to attend the funeral of the late King Hussein, who died
of lymphatic cancer at the age of 63 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah, the eldest son of Hussein, acceded to the Jordanian
throne hours after Hussein died.

<P>
MAPUTO, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Cholera has killed five people
in the last five days in the Mozambican capital, and sent 205
others to Central Hospital of Maputo, local health official said.
</P>
<P>
The Noticias newspaper Saturday quoted the directress of the
Maputo Health Bureau, Olivia Ferreira, as saying here Friday that
the epidemic disease broke out due to the heavy rains in the last
two weeks across the country, especially in the southern areas.
</P>
<P>
The directress said that the heavy rains had damaged the
running water supply systems, forcing people to drink water from
the polluted rivers, a major cause of cholera.
</P>
<P>
She said that some parts of the water pipes broke, reducing the
running water supply while increased mud and sand in the rivers
greatly affected the handling capability of water plants.
</P>
<P>
The health official called on the residents in the capital city
to take preventive measures to curb the further spread of
cholera.
</P>
<P>
Several hundreds of people died of the disease in the hardest
hit period from the end of 1997 to early 1998 when 600 others were
hospitalized for cholera.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year, some 1,500 people reportedly died of
cholera across the southern African country while almost 30,000
suffered from the diseased.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Egyptian newspapers on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- An Arab businessmen council was set up for consolidating
Arab solidarity through the Arab League and for supporting the
unified Arab action in economic and social fields. The council,
comprising 50 businessmen, is headed by Arab League Secretary
General Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Meguid.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein will visit Egypt soon as
part of his Arab and European tour, said Jordanian reliable sources
on Friday. Abdullah will hold talks with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak on boosting bilateral ties and measures to urge Israel to
implement the peace agreements with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Al-Gomhuria:
</P>
<P>
-- Jordan's new King Abdullah Bin Hussein congratulated Syrian
President Hafez al-Assad late Friday on his reelection for a fifth
five-year term in office. In their telephone conversations,
King Abdullah expressed his country's keenness on boosting ties
with Syria in various fields.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Mail:
</P>
<P>
-- International donors praised Egypt's economic reforms on
Friday, but decided to cut their assistance to the country in 1999
by about one billion U.S. dollars. The donors, meeting in a World
Bank-sponsored two-day conference in Paris, said the decline
reflected a smaller need for aid as private investment becomes
increasingly important for the economy.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Calls for Arms Transfer Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia has appealed to
weapons manufacturers and marketeers to restrict arms transfer in
order to stop fueling armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Such transfer has led to armed conflicts being provoked or
prolonged, Malaysia's Permanent Representative to the United
Nations Hasmy Agam said at a UN Security Council meeting on
"Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict" in New York, whose
speech was released here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The arms transfer restriction is "imperative if we are to stop
fueling further armed conflict in our contemporary world," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia feels that there should also be a more concerted
international effort and collaboration to combat illegal arms
flow, Hasmy said, urging the international community to support
selected measures identified to alleviate the suffering of
children caught in armed conflicts.
</P>
<P>
"Clearly, those who are guilty of acts of violence against
children during armed conflict should be punished accordingly,"
Hasmy said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is glad that among such punitive measures is that the
targeting of schools and hospitals has now been made a war crime
under the New Statute of the International Criminal Court, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Hasmy said Malaysia also shared the concern regarding the
access of civilian populations to international protection and
humanitarian assistance.

<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Neither the financial crisis
in Asia and Brazil nor turmoil anywhere else in the world has had
any effect on the spirit in which 1.2 billion Chinese are
welcoming in the Chinese Lunar New Year, known here as the Spring
Festival.
</P>
<P>
According to ancient Chinese astrology, February 16 will mark
the end of the Year of the Tiger and usher in the Year of the
Rabbit.
</P>
<P>
Beneath colored rabbit balloons and large discount ads,
Beijingers are elbowing their way through the crowds in the
bustling shopping malls and supermarkets, hunting for goods and
gifts.
</P>
<P>
The residents in an increasingly modern Beijing still prefer to
spend this most import festival of the year in a traditional way.
One survey shows that 86 percent of Beijingers plan to reunite
with families and friends during this holiday season.
</P>
<P>
And Chinese children are looking forward to receiving gifts and
money from their parents and grandparents during Spring Festival.
</P>
<P>
"I was very excited when my mother gave me ten or twenty cents
at Spring Festival time when I was a child," said 36-year-old Li
Yimei.
</P>
<P>
"I will give my son 100 yuan this festival, and with the money
given by his grandparents and other relatives, he will probably
receive about 1,000 yuan," said Li.

The annual gala entertainment program presented by China
Central Television on the eve of the festival has been a regular
part of the celebrations for 16 years now.
</P>
<P>
"Although it is becoming more and more difficult to please
everyone, this program is still the focus for many people," said
Zhang Hong, who works for a company attached to Qinghua University.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, China's largest commercial city, will have a more
international flavor to its celebrations this year with singing
stars from Japan, Singapore, Thailand and Hong Kong slated to
perform on the city's stages.
</P>
<P>
Many residents are planning to travel during the holidays,
including nearly ten thousand to Hong Kong, Macao, southeast Asia,
Australia and Europe, double the number who did so last year.
</P>
<P>
"All 300 tables in our restaurant have been reserved for
festival eve," said a waiter at Shanghai's New World Restaurant.
</P>
<P>
In the south China city of Guangzhou, more than 100,000
residents will take trips arranged by travel agencies, and some
will make the long journey to the easternmost point in China to be
the first to welcome the Year of the Rabbit.
</P>
<P>
In northeast China's Harbin City in Heilongjiang Province and
the city of Shenyang in Liaoning Province, residents will be
allowed to set off fireworks again after a four-year ban, adding
to the gaiety of the festival.

The Tibetan New Year comes several days earlier than the Spring

<HEADLINE> HK SAR Secretary of Justice On Beijing Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Elsie Leung Oi-sie, secretary
of justice of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR),
today exchanged views with relevant departments of the State
Council and the National People's Congress Standing Committee on a
recent verdict of the SAR's Court of Final Appeal.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa, Leung came to
Beijing on Friday to brief relevant central departments and law
experts on the verdict concerning the right of abode of some Hong
Kong residents' children living in inland areas.
</P>
<P>
Leung held meetings today with representatives of the Hong Kong
and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council and the Commission
of Legislative Affairs of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Leung told reporters she had heard the main
concern of the relevant departments on some of the terms of the
verdict which involved the power and status of the NPC and its
Standing Committee, as well as the interpretation of the Basic Law
of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
Relevant departments of said these terms contravened the
principles of the state constitution and the Basic Law, and
corrections must be made in this matter, Leung said, adding that
her meeting helped increase mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
The relevant departments showed concern over the rapid increase
in the population of Hong Kong and the heavy social burden caused
by this verdict, according to Leung.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong residents' children living in inland areas are still
residents of those areas, and must obtain approval before settling
in Hong Kong, and are subject to related laws and border entry and
exit regulations, Leung said that she was told by the relevant
departments.
</P>
<P>
Leung expressed the hope that the handling of this matter will
not affect the confidence of Hong Kong residents in the rule of
law, and that related SAR departments will handle it with a
positive and constructive attitude.
</P>
<P>
She also quoted Tung Chee Hwa as saying that the "one country,
two systems" is a new concept and is inevitable that it will pose
some questions in its implementation.
</P>
<P>
She said she believes that the matter will be solved in a sound
manner, since the Hong Kong SAR and inland areas have forged a
good relationship in the 20 months since the establishment of the
SAR.

<P>
NAIROBI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
given an alarm over the cholera epidemic which so far has killed
at least 28 people in the eastern Coast Province.
</P>
<P>
Director of the Medical Services, Julius Meme, said Friday that
all the eight provinces had been put on alert to fight the
disease.
</P>
<P>
Saturday's Daily Nation quoted Meme as saying that the Ministry
of Health has distributed adequate antibiotics and intravenous
fluids to hospitals and health centers to help treat those who
have been affected by cholera.
</P>
<P>
Kenyans should observe basic hygiene standards to help minimize
the risk of the epidemic spreading, the health official urged.
</P>
<P>
Meme also cautioned residents in the affected areas against
bathing in and washing clothes at the source of the contaminated
water from River Jombo.
</P>
<P>
He said the Coast outbreak was suspected to have originated
from the Lunga Lunga area in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the director said an inter-sectoral public health
surveillance team had been set up in capital Nairobi to ensure
that a similar outbreak will be averted.

WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Allen Iverson finally came
up with an outstanding offensive performance, just in time for the
Philadelphia 76ers' first loss of the season tonight.
</P>
<P>
Iverson scored 46 points, nearly equaling his total during the
76ers' 3-0 start, but Malik Rose atoned for poor performances by
David Robinson and Tim Duncan to lead the San Antonio Spurs to a
98-94 victory.
</P>
<P>
Rose scored a career-high 22 points on 10-of-12 shooting and
grabbed nine rebounds as the Spurs snapped a three-game losing
streak.
</P>
<P>
Iverson's score tied Grant Hill for the most in an NBA game
this season. Philadelphia was trying for its first 4-0 start since
1984-85, and Iverson scored 25 in the first half, and added 16
more in the fourth as Philadephia came back from a 15-point
deficit to tie the game at 91-all.
</P>
<P>
Robinson, Duncan and Avery Johnson scored 15 points apiece for
the Spurs, which just shot 28-for-51 at the line.
</P>
<P>
Hughes had 12 points and George Lynch 11 for the 76ers.

<HEADLINE> Chang-like Mamiit Impresses Sybase Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Sybase Open will
feature two players with the similar background in the seminfinal
match as both Cecil Mamiit and Michael Chang outclassed their
opponents in quarterfinals on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mamiit disposed of Mark Woodforde 7-6 (7-5), 4-6, 6-3 in 2
hours, 27minutes while fourth seed Chang destroyed Christian Ruud
6-1, 7-5 at the men's tournament at San Jose, California.
</P>
<P>
In his first quarterfinal match in an ATP tour event, Mamiit,
who bears great similarity with Chang in height and origin, has
stuck to a baseline game and moved about the court, trying to
incorporate Chang's running style and metal toughness into his
game.
</P>
<P>
Similar to diminutive Chang, Mamiit is measured only 5-foot-8,
short by today's tennis standard, and like Chang's Chinese-
American background, Mamiit's parents are Filipinos though he
himself is a native of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
Mamiit, the 1996 NCAA singles champion, said that he hopes to
follow the example of Chang, who has been a hero to many Asian-

<HEADLINE> EDS-Consumer Satisfaction Survey Ministry Gives Ear to Consumers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of
Information Industry (MII) is to conduct its most extensive survey
ever in the first half of this year about customer satisfaction
with the country's telecommunications services.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Telecommunications Administration of the MII
called together earlier this week the 38 inter-regional
telecommunication operators across the country to order a
nationwide survey in the four fields of mobile telephony, Internet,
radio paging and telephone information services.
</P>
<P>
"The survey aims to discover inferior areas in service and find
out the average level of service quality in the country's
telecommunications sector," the ministry stated in a news release
today.
</P>
<P>
The MII will publicize the names of the top operators that
customers are most satisfied with by mid year.
</P>
<P>
"Publication will help the operators that boast quality service
and competitiveness to accelerate expansion, so that the
telecommunications service market will become more and more
regulated," the news release said.
</P>
<P>
This is a further step that the one-year-old MII took to re-
focus government administration on consumers' needs and service.
</P>
<P>
"The government wants to demonstrate that the basic line of
telecommunications administration lies in safeguarding national
interests and the lawful rights of consumers," said Zhang
Chunjiang, director-general of the Bureau of Telecommunications
Administration.
</P>
<P>
The MII plans to adopt new service standards and quality
supervision systems on various telecommunications services this
year.
</P>
<P>
"We will strengthen resolution of service problems that people
strongly deplore," Zhang said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese People Satisfied with Life Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Most Chinese urban citizens
expressed satisfaction with their lifestyles in 1998, according to
a recent survey conducted by an influential investigation company
here.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based Horizon Market Survey and Analysis Company
surveyed some 5,700 urban residents above the age of 18 in 11
cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenyang and
Chongqing. Results showed that 6.8 percent of the respondents were
very satisfied with their life in 1998 and 63.6 percent of the
respondents were quite satisfied.
</P>
<P>
Of the respondents, only 2.3 percent said the question was hard
to answer.
</P>
<P>
Compared with life in 1997, 5.2 percent of the respondents said
their lifestyle had improved remarkably in 1998, 28.1 percent
thought their life improved a little bit and 42.8 percent said it
was the same.
</P>
<P>
The group of respondents experiencing notable improvements in
lifestyles were between the ages of 18 and 24 and above the age of
55. Most of them had received higher education and had
considerably high income, the survey showed.
</P>
<P>
Middle-aged people, blue collar workers and those made
redundant as well as those who have not received higher education
tend to consider that there was a drop in the quality of their
lives.
</P>
<P>
Researchers also found that the level of education has a
crucial influence on satisfaction with lifestyle.

<HEADLINE> India, Pakistan Launch Bus Diplomacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The bus service between
India's capital New Delhi and Pakistan's cultural city Lahore with
a distance of 500 km is expected to enhance the interaction and
relations between the peoples of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee will be a passenger
on board the historic inaugural run of the bus service to Lahore
on February 20 and he will be received at the border by Pakistan
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
The decision to introduce the bus service was taken by the two
prime ministers when they had met in New York last September. The
bus service, the trial runs for which have already been made by
the two sides, will be the first of its kind to ferry passengers
outside India. The service, twice a week from each side by each
operator from New Delhi and Lahore, will be on Tuesday, Wednesday,
Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
At present, nearly 1,000 passengers from both sides avail the
bi-weekly train service provided between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Although there is no word on the agenda of talks, the two prime
ministers are expected to hold talks on wide-ranging subjects of
regional and bilateral nature. Vajpayee has already said that he
was going to Pakistan with an "open mind". India's offer of no
first use of nuclear weapons is also expected to figure during the
talks.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee's visit to Pakistan is the first by an Indian prime
minister in nearly 10 years, though they have been meeting in
third countries. The last such visit by an Indian prime minister
was by Rajiv Gandhi when he had visited Pakistan in 1989.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, India and Pakistan are engaged in foreign
secretary-level dialogue to discuss eight identified issues, which
include peace and security, including confidence building
measures, Jammu and Kashmir, etc. The next round of dialogue is to
be held in New Delhi from February 17. But this has been now put
off in view of the Vajpayee's visit to Lahore from February 20.
Vajpayee's visit to Pakistan is expected to raise the ongoing
dialogue between the two countries from official level to
political level.
</P>
<P>
Since division in 1947, India and Pakistan have gone to war
three times and constant skirmishes along the Control Line in
disputed Kashmir areas have been reported. The two countries have
held several rounds of talks in a bid to solve their differences,
yet they failed due to deep gap over the Kashmir issue. India
maintains that Kashmir is its part of territory while Pakistan
maintains that it is a disputed area. Pakistan has time and again
said that Kashmir is a root cause of tension between the two
countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- A Bangladesh team will leave for
Brussels this week to finalize negotiations on the signing of the
third-generation cooperation agreement between this South Asian
nation and the European Union (EU), The Financial Express daily
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The discussion on the accord, covering a wide range of
economic, trade, development and social issues, will take place in
Brussels on February 17 and 18.
</P>
<P>
The negotiation process is almost completed, and only some
adjustment in wordings like intellectual property rights and the
issue of trade liberalization remain unfinished, the report quoted
sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The accord will be signed upon completion of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was scheduled to have been signed by the end of
1998, but the final round of negotiations between the two sides
was delayed as Bangladesh's commerce secretary could not make time
to visit Brussels within the scheduled time.
</P>
<P>
The first development cooperation deal between Bangladesh and
the then European Economic Community was negotiated in 1975 and
signed in 1976, in which only the "real areas" of international
relations were covered.
</P>
<P>
As the accord continued beyond its limited tenure of five
years, the second one was skipped and now it was time for the
third generation agreement which would have new issues like
intellectual property rights and some social clauses such as human
rights, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
EU is the largest trading bloc of Bangladesh.

<HEADLINE> Parliament Approves Increase of Bulgaria's Quota in IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Bulgarian Parliament Friday
approved almost unanimously an increase of the country's quota in
the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
A total of 146 of the 150 MPs voted for the decision, with one
against and three abstaining.
</P>
<P>
The quota will increase by 175 million Special Drawing Rights (
SDRs), equivalent to 245 million U.S. dollars, or 37.7 percent, to
640.2 million SDRs (896.28 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
A quarter of the 175 million SDRs could be paid in SDR or other
currency the IMF usually uses in its payments, the Finance
Minister Mouravei Radev told the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Given the country's financial troubles, another IMF member
country may extend a loan to Bulgaria. The loan will be floated
free of interest and any charges, said Radev.
</P>
<P>
The remaining of the 175 million SDRs, about 131.4 million SDRs
(183.96 million dollars), could be paid in the national currency
of lev, and remitted through issue of a non-transferrable interest-
free promissory note crediting the IMF's account with the National
Bank of Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
The actual payment will equal only some 1,000 million leva (577,
400 dollars) required to meet the new quota.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Brokerage Gets IFC Financing for Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC), member of the World Bank Group, Friday approved
a financing package of 20 million U.S. dollars to a South Korean
securities brokerage firm, the first financing of its kind in the
East Asian country.
</P>
<P>
The fund will be used to help Ssangyong Investment and
Securities Company, Ltd. (SISCO) restructure and streamline its
operations, the IFC said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The project, involving the delinking of the SISCO from
Ssangyong Group which was South Korea's sixth largest conglomerate
until September 1998, demonstrates that foreign investors can spin
off parts of a group by taking a controlling stake within a
comprehensive restructuring plan approved by the South Korean
authorities, the IFC said.
</P>
<P>
SISCO's new controlling shareholders, headed by Hambrecht &AMP;
Quist Asia Pacific, headquartered in San Francisco, U.S., expect
to substantially improve operating policies and procedures and
raise disclosure and transparency levels to global standards,
according to the IFC.
</P>
<P>
IFC Vice President for Investment Operations Jemal-ud-din
Kassum said that the project would help mobilize additional
financing to complete SISCO's recapitalization plan and stimulate
further foreign capital inflows into the South Korean securities
brokerage industry.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring of SISCO is also likely to increase market
confidence and be viewed as a model of corporate restructuring in
South Korea, he added.
</P>
<P>
SISCO, formed in 1973 and taken over by Ssangyong Group in 1984,
is one of the country's largest securities companies with a nation-
wide network of 66 branches.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Considers Tax Cut to Stimulate Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is consulting the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) about either lowering the value
added tax (VAT) or personal income tax under the seventh letter of
intent to stimulate the domestic demand, sources of the Finance
Ministry said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The move followed a series of interest rate cuts which have
failed to immediately boost consumption or stem the deflationary
spiral.
</P>
<P>
The government is considering to cut VAT to the pre-crisis
level of seven percent from the current level of 10 percent. A
decision is expected next week, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda said recently that the
government was planning to implement an economic stimulus package
and increase fiscal spending in March.
</P>
<P>
The government is under pressure to produce some economic
expansion this year following negative growth of eight percent in
the country's gross domestic product last year.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment is still rising and banks are still experiencing
rising levels of non-performing loans as business failures
increase.
</P>
<P>
A recently released study showed that the poorest members of
society had shouldered the biggest burden from both the VAT and
overall tax levies.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the IMF has adopted a "very flexible"
position and is ready to give the Thai government full authority
to revamp macroeconomic policy.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese courts have
strengthened the battle against pornographic and illegal
publishing, in an effort to bring wholesome entertainment to the
public for the Spring Festival, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
A circular released Friday by the Supreme People's Court (SPC)
listed several cases regarding illegal pornographic books and
video compact discs (VCDs) that have been recently concluded.
</P>

The criminals involved received imprisonment sentences from one
to 11 years, depending on the number of pornographic books and
VCDs they had sold and the money they had made from their illegal
activities, the paper said.

<P>
They have also been ordered by the courts to pay fines up to 10,
000 yuan (1,205 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Liu Jiachen, SPC vice-president, revealed Friday that more and
more cases concerning illegal and pornographic publications have
been brought in front of the courts.

<P>
He pledged that courts across the country, now busy with these
cases, will render an iron-handed crackdown on criminal actions of
this kind, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
There is a separate section in the 1997 version of the Chinese
Criminal Law about the "crimes of making, selling and spreading
pornographic articles."

In addition, the top court of China last December issued a
judicial interpretation of handling criminal cases concerning
illegal publications.

<HEADLINE> Albanian Women's Group Urges Families to Turn in Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- An Albanian women's group
Friday urged families to turn in weapons to authorities to keep
them out of the reach of children, a day after two kids died when
playing with a gun in the southern port city of Vlore.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, a 14-year-old boy accidentally shot dead his 10-
year-old playmate with a gun he found at home. Scared by what he
had done, the boy immediately killed himself with the same gun.
</P>
<P>
Following the shocking tragedy, the Women's Homeland of Vlore --
consisting mainly of mothers in the city -- issued a public appeal
to families to turn in their weapons and called for all-out
support from municipal authorities, organizations and media.
</P>
<P>
"Home-stored weapons will bring death. Turn in your weapons.
Only by doing so, can we protect the life of our children and
their happy future," the appeal reads.
</P>
<P>
During the nation-wide riots that hit Albania in early 1997,
several military arsenals were ransacked, causing 600,000 to 700,
000 weapons to scatter among civilians.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian government, with the help of international
organizations, has been making great efforts to recover these
weapons, but with little effect so far.

<HEADLINE> Colombia's Flower Sales to U.S. Drop Due to "La Nina" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The "La Nina"
phenomenon in recent months prevented Colombian flowers to blossom
in time, thus delaying their harvest and affecting sales to the
United States for St. Valentine's Day which falls on February 14.
</P>
<P>
Rosas Colombianas company manager Fernando Fonseca Friday said
that January 26 to February 6 was the period in which all the
orders for St. Valentine's Day were dispatched. But this year
about 20,000 boxes (one box with 150 flowers) were not exported to
the United States because of the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
Fonseca said that St. Valentine's Day was the best sales
opportunity for Colombian flower producers both in term of
quantity and in price. The sales at this period represent 10 to 15
percent of their sales to the U.S. market.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador also export flowers to the States, taking up 25 percent
of the U.S. market, compared to 50 percent by Colombia.

<HEADLINE> Experts Propose Measures for Sustainable Development of Mining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese experts have urged
that "practicing thrift of resources" as a basic state policy so
as to achieve the sustainable development of the mining industry.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has already embodied "population control
" and "environmental protection" as two state policies.
</P>
<P>
Experts attending a meeting on the "Sustainable Development of
the Mining Industry" held recently in Beijing pointed out the
contradiction of the severe shortage of mining resources and the
growing demand on such resources is intensifying in the country.
</P>
<P>
Other major problems of the industry include the accelerated
consumption of the verified resources in comparison to the slow
growth in reserves; the waste in resources and damage to the
ecology; inadequate investment, backward technology, and poor
economic returns, they acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
"China's annual mineral ore output stands at about five billion
tons, ranking the third in the world, which can basically cope
with the need of future economic development. However, the
industry is also facing great challenges," experts said.
</P>
<P>
They proposed deepening the reform, expanding the investment in
geological exploration, readjusting mining policies and
establishing modern enterprise system according to the law of the
socialist market economy and encouraging technical progress.

<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The 9th Group of 15 (G-15)
summit concluded Friday in Montego Bay, Jamaica, with a commitment
to promote the development of their countries, face the currency
crisis and defend regional interests.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after the three-day summit, the leaders
from the 15 developing countries committed themselves to improve
the living standards of their people.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the world economy panorama at the end of the
century "points to the need of achieving a more just distribution
of the benefits produced by the globalization and liberalization
processes."
</P>
<P>
They reiterated their commitment to establish policies based on
the laws of the market, which have an important role in the
development and the promotion of institutions and infrastructure
in the countries.
</P>
<P>
They said that they will take advantage of the technological
and human advances to act in time to reduce in their countries
the impacts of the crises provoked by stock market fluctuations.
</P>
<P>
They said that the growth of the G-15 countries has been
detained by the systematic impact of the crises, the high
unemployment rates, the growing inequality of income between the
countries, and the threats of a new protectionism.
</P>
<P>
The participants said in the document that another common
characteristic is that the crises have worsened poverty and have
generated social instability.
</P>
<P>
For this reason the G-15 asked for more assistance to the
multilateral organizations, such as the International Monetary
Fund and the World Bank to effectively face the economic crises.
</P>
<P>
The G-15 member nations called for measures to watch and
supervise the operations of big financial markets, including the
speculative.

They also proposed the inclusion of social security networks as
an integral part of the development policies and programs, to
guarantee the fulfillment of the basic needs for the poor.
</P>
<P>
The G-15 members expressed their willingness to improve and
intensify their consultations and dialogues with the most
industrialized countries, or the Group of Eight (G-8).
</P>
<P>
They said that the international community must accelerate the
implementation of the project for the most indebted countries,
helping them reduce the burden and the service of their debt at a
bilateral and multilateral level.
</P>
<P>
The 10th G-15 summit will be held in 2000 in Egypt, and the 11
th in 2001 in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The Group of 15 is made up of Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Egypt,
India, Indonesia, Jamaica, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru,
Senegal, Zimbabwe, Venezuela, Sri Lanka, and Algeria.
</P>
<P>
G-15 member states account for 30 percent of the world's
population and produce 2 trillion U.S. dollars in goods, or nearly
40 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) of all developing
nations.

<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- An improvement in the quality

</P>
<P>
An official with the Military Service Law Revision Office under
the Department of General Staff said that the world's major
military powers began reducing the sizes of the troops and
professionalizing their militaries after the threat of a large-
scale hot war faded with the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that China is to trim its 3-million-strong PLA
to 2.5 million by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
The official emphasized that "when our army becomes smaller, we
will have to make its stronger to ensure our national safety."
</P>
<P>
The revised law shortens the service of compulsory servicemen
from three or four years to two years and raises the ceiling for
professional servicemen from 18 years to 30 years. Thus the
portion of professional servicemen will gradually grow.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the PLA expects the number of
professional servicemen grow from 18 percent at present to about
35 percent of the total by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
The revised law allows the PLA to recruit professionals with
specialized skills the army needs of the citizenry, another effort
for upgrading the amry's quality.

<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Mark Price, the NBA's all-
time leader in free-throw percentage and a four-time All-Star,
officially announced his retirement from the NBA at a news
conference in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Price, who turns 35 on Monday, was released by the Orlando
Magic on June 30. He played for four different teams in his last
four seasons, missing a total of 140 games due to injury.
</P>
<P>
"You have to know when to say when," he said. "And now is the
perfect time. I did have offers to play this year. It makes me
feel good to step down as my choice and not because nobody wants
me."
</P>
<P>
The brother of Houston Rockets guard Brent Price, Mark Price
played 12 years in the NBA and holds records for free-throw
shooting percentage in the regular season (90.4) and playoffs (94.
4).
</P>
<P>
Price averaged 15.2 points and 6.7 assists per game for Orlando,
Cleveland, Washington and Golden State. He was named to the All-
NBA First Team in 1993 with the Cavaliers and won a Gold Medal for
Dream Team at the 1994 World Championships in Toronto.

<HEADLINE> O'Neal's Injury not Serious </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Los Angeles Lakers were
able to breathe a sigh of relief today when it was determined that
an injury suffered by superstar Shaquille O'Neal is not considered
serious.
</P>
<P>
O'Neal did not play Thursday against the Minnesota Timberwolves
due to what was first thought to be strains of muscles in his
abdomen and right groin.
</P>
<P>
The Lakers were held to their lowest point total in more than
two years in an 86-75 loss.
</P>
<P>
Following an examination by team physician Steve Lombardo, it
was discovered that the injury that sidelined O'Neal was only a
strained right groin muscle.
</P>
<P>
Lakers spokesman John Black said O'Neal is listed as day-to-day
and will receive treatment the next two days in hopes of playing
Sunday afternoon against the Indiana Pacers.
</P>
<P>
O'Neal was injured at the end of Wednesday's 103-98 victory at
Denver, in which he scored 29 points. At last season's outset, he
had an abdominal injury that he later aggravated, forced to miss
20 games.
</P>
<P>
This is the third time in four seasons O'Neal has been
sidelined early in the campaign. He missed the first 23 games of
the 1995-96 season with a broken thumb.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Allows Currency to Float </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's Central Bank allowed
its currency, the sucre, to float freely on Friday.
</P>
<P>
News of the move caused the value of the sucre to drop sharply
from 7,300 against one U.S. dollar at Thursday's closing to 8,000
in the early trading hours Friday.
</P>
<P>
But the sucre rallied later Friday, standing at 7,400 against
the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank President Luis Jacome said the measure was
designed to ensure security to its internal market and to respond
to the needs to the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank has spent 60 million dollars of its reserves
this week buying the sucre to defend its value, Jacome said.
</P>
<P>
It will continue to intervene in the foreign exchange market to
protect the sucre against speculators, but in a more limited
fashion than before, he said.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Fidel Jaramillo resigned late Thursday due to
the nation's economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Jaramillo said he resigned because he opposed the government's
decision to impose one percent tax on bank transactions.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador was plagued by a massive budget deficit and Latin
America's highest inflation in 1998. It has been hurt by falling
prices for its main export item, oil.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador's decision to let its currency float came amid fears of
financial instability in the region following Brazil's decision
last month to freely float its currency, the real.

<HEADLINE> Albania to Strengthen Efforts to Crack Down on Coffee Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Albanian authorities will
strengthen their efforts to crack down on coffee smuggling in face
of rampant activities of smuggling the commodity into the country
over recent months, the local media reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the Ministry of Finance revealed that
the quantity of coffee imported in the country through the Customs
only totaled 1.7 tons in January, significantly lowered than the
actual mount consumed.
</P>
<P>
The quantity of coffee imported in 1998 averaged at 14.5 tons
monthly, excluding the amount smuggled into the country, according
to the statistics.
</P>
<P>
Albanian customs authorities said that a considerable amount of
coffee smuggled is illegally carried into the country using
livestocks.
</P>
<P>
In face of such rampant activities of coffee smuggling, the
national information bureau, Customs, prosecution authorities, the
Ministry of Finance and other government authorities have decided
to coordinate their efforts to crack down on activities of coffee
smuggling, the local media reported.
</P>
<P>
In strengthening the anti-smuggling efforts, the Ministry of
Finance will act to check the accounts of companies operating the
sale of coffee and re-export of goods and examine all documents
for the import and export of coffee.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the authorities will also strengthen the inspection
of border checkpoints against activities of smuggling, according
to the local media.

<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Peru's gold sales went up by 85
percent in 1998 to reach 925.3 million U.S. dollars, Customs
sources said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Peruvian gold output stood at 93.78 tons in 1998, or a 22.07
percent rise, the Energy and Mines Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The output increase is attributed to an expansion in the
Yanacocha gold deposit, which alone yielded 41.35 tons of gold
last year.
</P>
<P>
Due to the drop of metal prices on the market, gold has become
the only metal produced in Peru that covers its costs and even
generates profits.

SOFIA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The snowstorm which started
Thursday night cut electricity supply to 166 settlements, water
supply to 21, disrupted telephone connections to 17 across the
country, and created difficulties along the roads, Bulgarian civil
defense authorities announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
In Sofia, the runways of the Sofia airport are being cleaned

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Says Int'l Rubber Agency "Technically Dead" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The International Natural
Rubber Organization (INRO) has in effect been killed by the recent
withdrawal of Malaysia and Thailand from its membership, according
to the Indonesian Rubber Association (Gapkindo).
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of the two major rubber producers would make the
organization's buffer stock operations no longer functional, the
Jakarta Post daily Saturday quoted Gapkindo executive director
A.F.S. Budiman as saying.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Indonesia would follow suit and quit the group,
Budiman said Friday that membership in the organization was no
longer necessary because the INRO technically did not exist
anymore.
</P>
<P>
He said a special session would be formally held to talk about
the fate of the rubber agency.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia are the world's top rubber
producers. Malaysia has served notice of withdrawal from the INRO,
a group of 6 producer countries and 17 consumers, effective
October 15, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, the world's largest rubber producer, shocked the
market early this week with the announcement it would also quit
the INRO, which has long been accused of not doing enough to prop
up sagging prices.
</P>
<P>
Thailand also decided not to pay contributions worth 10.84
million U.S. dollars to the INRO's buffer stock account for the
new round of interventions.
</P>
<P>
Budiman said the INRO's imminent demise would put pressure on
the already depressed Indonesian market.
</P>
<P>
"There's nothing we can do if the INRO is disbanded. We expect
prices to fall further, especially if consumers do not absorb
enough rubber," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Rubber prices have slipped to a 30-year low of around 60 U.S.
cents a kilogram since the Asian financial crisis began in the
middle of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Budiman said, for Indonesia, the INRO is still needed to
facilitate the country's rubber exports. Indonesia's rubber
exports are predicted to increase by at least five percent to 1.61
million tons this year from 1.53 million tons in 1998, but the
exports are expected to earn less foreign exchange due to lower
demand and lower prices.
</P>
<P>
The INRO's main aim is to stabilize world rubber prices by
buying when prices drop sharply and selling when prices surge.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian, Argentine Presidents Promise to Enhance Mercosur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso and his Argentine counterpart, Carlos Menem, on
Friday ratified the South American Common Market (Mercosur)
agreements and the definitive implementation of the common market.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents signed a document to this effect after a
meeting in Sao Jose dos Campos, Brazil, to discuss the effects of
the real devaluation on the bilateral trade, and the strengthening
of the Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders decided to create a joint commission to
supervise the trade between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that Brazil's subsidies on its exports to other
Mercosur members will be eliminated in compensation for the
effects of the devaluation of the Brazilian currency, the real, on
trade among the group.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso told reporters that Mercosur is the solution to the
transitory crisis his country is undergoing, and thanked Menem for
his support to Brazil in this case.
</P>
<P>
Menem said that his country went through a similar crisis in
1989, but surmounted the difficulties after taking stringent
measures. Today Argentina grows and wants Brazil to grow too, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Argentina exported to Brazil 8.02 billion U.S. dollars worth of
products in 1998, and imported from its neighbor 6.74 billion
dollars, registering a 1.28-billion-dollar surplus.
</P>
<P>
The Brazilian Enterprises Association for Mercosur Integration
said that the devaluation of the real could help increase up to 15
percent the Brazilian exports to its Mercosur partners.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso and Menem also agreed Friday to monitor the trade among
the regional group, which also includes Paraguay and Uruguay, with
Chile and Bolivia as associate members.
</P>
<P>
A diplomatic shuttle has been underway over the past days in
order to dispel the clouds over Mercosur.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso met Uruguayan President Luis Maria Sanguinetti last
week in Brasilia. On Thursday, he also met Paraguayan President
Raul Cubas. The four presidents of Mercosur members are scheduled
to meet in Rio de Janeiro next week.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The state of alert in
Mexico's Popocatepetl volcano continued Friday when steam and gas
emissions persisted, National Disaster Prevention Center
researcher Alicia Martines said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
She told the press that the activity of the volcano, located
some 80 kilometers southeast of the capital city, diminished in
comparison to Thursday, because only eight eruptions of water
steam, gases, and small quantities of cinders were registered
Friday.
</P>
<P>
She said that the emission of sulphur dioxide, the deformation
of the volcanic cone and the growth of the lava body maintain at
stable levels.
</P>
<P>
She noted that police personnel remain in the zone of danger
with radio communication equipment to warn of any danger, and
advise the public to keep a distance of seven kilometers away from
the volcano.
</P>
<P>
According to the Civil Protection Agency of the state of
Morelos, which neighbors the volcano zone, the steam and gas
eruptions reached a height of 600 to 800 meters.
</P>
<P>
The Popocatepetl volcano spewed Thursday morning 10 columns of
gas and steam and there was in the afternoon a low magnitude
earthquake that lasted less than one minute, without danger to the
public.

<HEADLINE> China to Beef Up Its Shipbuilding Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 13 (Xinhua) -- China plans to restructure its
shipbuilding industry and step up technical upgrading in the
industry in a bid to sharpen its competitive edge, said today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
To break up monopoly and facilitate competition, the government
will split China State Shipbuilding Corp (CSSC), the industry's
backbone, into two large corporate groups.
</P>
<P>
The government has required shipbuilding enterprises of a
certain production capacity to establish research and development
(R&AMP;D) facilities of their own in addition to the six State-level
priority R&AMP;D centers, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that CSSC's total turnover amounted to
22.06 billion yuan (dlrs 2.6 billion) in 1998 amid the Asian
financial crisis and a slack international shipping market.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the steady development of the industry to
technical upgrading, capacity expansion, investment in research
and development, and improved management expertise.
</P>
<P>
China's shipbuilding sector has reportedly lost a significant
number of vessel orders to foreign competitors as a result of
currency devaluation and lower production efficiency, according to
the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The government has begun to value the importance of
shipbuilding industry as a primary foreign-exchange earner and is
encouraging it to expand its share of the international and
domestic markets.

<HEADLINE> 3 Nabbed for Carrying Heroin Near Jakarta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- Police have arrested three
suspects caught in possession of two kilograms of heroin at a
hotel in Tangerang near Jakarta Thursday night, the Indonesian
Observer reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The suspects were identified as Mechelio Tiv from France, and
two Indonesian nationals, both residents of Tangerang.
</P>
<P>
Tangerang police head Lieutenant Colonel Puji Iskandar said the
police had confiscated the narcotics worth 4 million U.S. dollars
in the street.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the arrest of the suspects was based on a
series of tip-offs supplied by local residents.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Metro Jaya police spokesman Colonel Alex Bambang
Riatmodjo said that drug consumption in Jakarta has increased
rapidly due to the accelerated instances of heroin smuggling from
overseas, especially from the African continent.
</P>
<P>
He declared that in this month alone, police have arrested 50
persons who were distributors and consumers of controlled
substances, most of whom were thugs and hoodlums.
</P>
<P>
In order to uncover the drug distribution network, the police
have questioned 400 thugs, some of whom were taken into police
custody after confiscating heroin or other drugs in their
possession.
</P>
<P>
He said a part of the confiscated drugs had been destroyed in a
formal ceremony several days ago in the yard of the Indonesian
Police Headquarters in South Jakarta, amidst fears that the drugs
would be stolen by enterprising police officers and sold to
consumers in Jakarta.

<HEADLINE> Decision on Wilkinson Bid to be Revealed Next Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Howard Wilkinson has told the
English Football Association whether he is willing to stay on as
England coach, but refused to publicly reveal his answer until
next week.
</P>
<P>
However, Wilkinson did indicate that the FA seem to be looking
for a short-term appointment until June.
</P>
<P>
He made a brief statement following a lengthy meeting with Noel
White, chairman of the FA's international committee, charged with
making a decision on the successor to Glenn Hoddle.
</P>
<P>
Wilkinson, whose post as caretaker boss for the friendly
against France, expired on Thursday, said: "I have had a meeting
with Noel White this afternoon to discuss the current situation at
the FA in the context of the recent restructuring proposals being
taken forward within the FA.
</P>
<P>
"These proposals concern the integration of all professional
and international football within the FA.
</P>
<P>
"The implementation of these proposals and the selection of the
right person for the England coach are crucial if England are to
become the world's best.
</P>
<P>
"The rush to make a decision, any decision, must not be allowed
to force compromises to have to be made. These decisions will
affect football in this country for the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of our discussions, it is expected that an
announcement will be made next week concerning the situation
taking us through to June.
</P>
<P>
"Given my position within the FA, it would not be appropriate
at this time to make public my personal decision in respect of the
position of England coach," he added.

<HEADLINE> Ghana to Consider Bid for African Nations Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ACCRA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Ghana will consider bidding to
host next year's African Nations Cup in place of Zimbabwe,
officials said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ghana Football Authority (GFA) Chairman Mohammed Nurudeen
Jawula told a press conference in Ghana's northern town of Tamale
that his outfit is consulting with internal stakeholders including
the Ministry of Finance to take a decision within a week or two.
</P>
<P>
He said the executive committee of the Confederation of African
Football (CAF) is expected in Accra in the next two weeks and "we
hope to put our case strongly before them as a replacement
candidate before they take a final decision in Guinea in March 14".
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe were stripped as hosts of the 2000 event by CAF last
Monday. The federation gave a deadline of March 10 for bids to
host the event, scheduled to kick off on January 10 next year.
</P>
<P>
South Africa has already declared interest in hosting the
Nations Cup for a second time after organising the tournament in
1996.
</P>
<P>
Alhaji Jawula said Ghana is using the forthcoming CAF Under 20
Youth tournament scheduled to take off next week to prove what she
can do when given chance.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed suggestions that Ghana was becoming over ambitious
and was "taking more than she could chew."
</P>
<P>
"It is only pessimists who think that way. If those who take
the final decision think that we are on the right path we have
every right to be ambitious."
</P>
<P>
Jawula said a country needs four well equipped stadiums to host
the competition and Ghana has identified six for consideration by
CAF.
</P>
<P>
"When we talk about hosting such a tournament, the Accra,
Kumasi and Obuasi stadiums come in handy while Cape Coast is about
90 percent completed. Tamale and Sekondi would also be developed
to meet the required standards," the GFA boss said.
</P>
<P>
The authorities have refurbished the Accra and Kumasi stadiums
at a cost of 10 billion cedis in preparation for next week's youth
championship.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe were disqualified as hosts of the African Cup on
Monday after the CAF executive committee found they had not made
sufficient progress in building stadiums for the tournament or
developing an infra-structure for the televising of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
Jawula said Ghana has facilities for accommodation and live
broadcast of matches and only needs to improve on them.

MOSCOW, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Olympic Committee
on Friday voiced its support for International Olympic Committee (
IOC) president Juan Antonio Samaranch in his work in the Olympic
movement despite the bribery scandals.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued at a national meeting, the committee also

implicated in the Salt Lake City 2002 Winter Olympics bidding
scandal.
</P>
<P>
"The international Olympic movement turned into the best

the planet in the 20th century," the statement said. "That was
especially vivid in the past two decades when Juan Antonio
Samaranch led the International Olympic Committee."
</P>
<P>
It said that one should not reach the conclusion that the
entire Olympic movement and the IOC leadership are in crisis only
on the basis of actions by some IOC members.
</P>
<P>
The committee said that Russia "protests against the wholesale
disparagement of the achievements, the work level and the leading
role of the International Olympic Committee."

LONDON, February 12 (Xinhua) - Britain said on Friday the
Contact Group on former Yugoslavia would be consulted over the
weekend on the talks between Serbs and Kosovo Albanians.
</P>
<P>
"The Contact Group will be consulted this weekend, maybe by
telephone with Robin Cook and Hubert Vedrine calling members," one
official said.
</P>
<P>
He said it was also possible that foreign ministers from the
six-nation Contact Group, comprising Britain, France, Germany,
Italy, Russia and the United States, would meet on Sunday, with
Paris the likely venue if a face-to-face meeting went ahead.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group last week summoned representatives from
Serbian government and Kosovo Albanians to talks in France in an
attempt to end the year-long conflict in the region.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which started in Rambouillet near French capital of
Paris last Saturday, were scheduled to last for a week.
</P>
<P>
But it was likely that the talks should have to continue for a

WELLINGTON, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The ruling New Zealand
National Party is catching up with its major rival the Labor
Party, according to the first two polls of this year.
</P>
<P>
The TV One-Colmar Brunton poll showed the National Party rising
six percentage points to 41 percent, just one percentage point
behind the Labor Party, which fell three percentage points from
the previous poll.
</P>
<P>
And the NBR-Compaq poll put the National Party up three
percentage points at 35 percent, still trailing the Labor Party
with 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the TV One-Colmar Brunton survey of 1,000 people, Prime
Minister Jenny Shipley rose six percentage points to 29 percent in
the preferred prime minister stakes, overtaking the Labor Party's
leader Helen Clark, who fell six percentage points to 19 percent.
</P>
<P>
The rising support rate for the National Party and its leader
Prime Minister Shipley can be attributed to the significant
improvement of the current economic situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The two polls have a margin of error of 3.2 percent and 3.5
percent respectively.

<HEADLINE> Man United Bid Worries ITC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The UK's commercial television
regulator, the Independent Television Commission (ITC), has
expressed reservations about the proposed takeover of Manchester
United football club by BSkyB, the satellite broadcaster
controlled by Rupert Murdoch.
</P>
<P>
Responding to newspaper reports that it had urged the
Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC) to block the takeover, the
ITC said any such deal would need to be carefully investigated "to
ensure that there will be effective competition".
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the organization said the issue was "
particularly acute" in the case of Premier League football clubs.
</P>
<P>
However, the ITC stopped short of saying whether it had asked
the MMC to block the deal as had been reported in the Financial
Times.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said the ITC had told the MMC that it should stop
such takeovers because they would impede the sale of broadcast
rights.
</P>
<P>
The evidence was given in private by officials headed by Peter
Rogers, the ITC chief executive.
</P>
<P>
They reportedly said that the acquisition of sporting teams by
broadcasters could distort the market in television rights to
matches, lower the price paid and affect the quality.
</P>
<P>
They are also reported to have said they were against a
conditional agreement to a takeover, on the grounds that the
conditions might not be enforceable because of the low standard of
management in some football clubs.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the MMC said any ITC objections would be
treated with respect but would hold no more sway than submissions
by the two companies involved, football fans, politicians and
other interested parties.
</P>
<P>
BSkyB said last night that it remained confident that there
were no competition grounds for blocking the takeover. BSkyB
already owns the rights to broadcast Premier League football until
2001.
</P>
<P>
It will ultimately be up to Trade Secretary Stephen Byers to
accept or reject the recommendation of the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission. He is expected to receive its report in March.
</P>
<P>
BSkyB's proposed 623 million pounds takeover of Manchester
United has produced widespread opposition among fans and small
shareholders, and from other smaller clubs.
</P>
<P>
They feared that the deal will lead to a reduction in the
revenues received by smaller clubs, and ultimately a European
super-league of top clubs that can only be viewed on a pay-per-
view basis.
</P>
<P>
Sports Minister Tony Banks and Football Taskforce head David
Mellor are among those who have expressed reservations about the
deal.
</P>
<P>
If the Manchester United bid does go through, it looks like
opening the floodgates for the ownership of other football clubs
by broadcasters.
</P>
<P>
Newcastle United has already received a bid from cable operator
NTL, while until recently Arsenal was in talks with television
broadcaster Carlton.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, investors in BSkyB have been optimistic that the
plan will be approved. BSkyB's share price has been rising,
boosted by the launch of its new digital service. The company has
attracted 7 million viewers to its Sky Sports channel, with
football one of the main draws.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 13 (Xinhua) -- The Monetary Board of the
Central Bank of the Philippines has approved the proposed merger
of Asianbank Corp. and Philippine Bank of Communications (PBCom),
which is set for completion in April.
</P>
<P>
This is the second approved merger for this year in the
Philippines. The first one was the merger between Prudential Bank
and Philipinas Bank.
</P>
<P>
"The highest policy-making body (monetary board) has approved
in principle the memorandum of understanding on the proposed
merger of Asianbank and PBCom on February 10," Central Bank
Gabriel Singson was quoted as saying by the Philippine Post
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Singson said that the approval is in line with the central bank
policy to develop larger and stronger banking institutions.
</P>
<P>
The governor is referring to the tightened minimum
capitalization requirement for all banks implemented last year in
a bid to shield the financial system from the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Banks were given up to next year to beef up their capital base
by 20 percent to 60 percent depending on what category they belong
to.

<HEADLINE> Three Appear in Court after Floodlight Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Three men arrested at a
football ground have appeared in court on charge of criminal
damage and conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
They appeared before magistrates to face charges in connection
with an alleged attempt to fix a Premiership match by sabotaging
floodlights.
</P>
<P>
The three men -- Chee Kew Ong, 49, a manager, and Eng Hwa Lim,
35, an electrical engineer, both from Paddington, London, and Wai
Yuen Liu, 37, a car salesman from Kensington, London -- were
remanded in custody until 19 February at Horseferry Road
Magistrates Court.
</P>
<P>
The three were arrested by officers from Scotland Yard's
Organised Crime Squad near Charlton Athletic's home ground in
southeast of London on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian nationals Ong and Lim and Hong Kong-born Liu said
nothing during the 20-minute hearing.
</P>
<P>
It was alleged that each of them had conspired with others to
obtain a financial advantage and "deny persons the opportunity to
win money by betting in that you were able to determine the
outcome of a match".
</P>
<P>
The second charge alleged that the three men had had electrical
equipment intended "to destroy or damage the electrical supply,
concourse and safety lighting belonging to Charlton Athletic
Football Club".
</P>
<P>
The men were told this alleged damage was "in a way which you
knew was likely to endanger human life".
</P>
<P>
Another man, a Briton aged 48, who was also arrested, was
earlier released on police bail.

<HEADLINE> FIFA Clears FA over "Cash-for-Votes" Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- World football's governing body
FIFA has cleared the Football Associations of England and Wales of
any wrong-doing over the "cash-for-votes" scandal.
</P>
<P>
The controversy over the proposed grant to the FA of Wales (FAW)
led to the departure of FA chief executive Graham Kelly and
chairman Keith Wiseman.
</P>
<P>
Press reports had alleged that there was a link between the
cash and Wales' intention to back Wiseman in his bid to become a
FIFA vice-president.
</P>
<P>
But FIFA investigated the affair and told the reporters that
there was no evidence of foul play and the matter was now closed.
</P>
<P>
A FIFA spokesman said: "The two associations involved were
asked to submit a report to FIFA on what happened.
</P>
<P>
"FIFA have found that there were no incorrect or improper
actions that would warrant further investigation. The case is now
closed as far as FIFA is concerned."
</P>
<P>
The FAW had always insisted the money would not go to them and
would instead be pumped into the Football Trust.
</P>
<P>
After the story was surfaced, Kelly became the first to resign
at the end of December, after the FA had conducted their own
investigation into the affair and decided he had acted without
consulting either the executive or the FA's full council in
advance.
</P>
<P>
Wiseman tried to cling onto power until a meeting of the full
council in January, but he followed Kelly out of the door after
being met with widespread opposition from within the FA.
</P>
<P>
After hearing the FA had been cleared, Kelly said: "It feels
rather strange.
</P>
<P>
"The first I heard of this was this -- I didn't know there was
an investigation going on but it's nice to be cleared by it.
</P>
<P>
"The critical issue was that I couldn't persuade the (FA)
executive committee that what I was doing was legitimate and in
the best interests of English football.
</P>
<P>
"We could have carried on arguing but it would have been a very
messy dispute, and I don't know whether I would have won
irrespective of today's findings by FIFA."
</P>
<P>
Geoff Thompson was installed as interim chairman following
Wiseman's demise, while director of public affairs David Davies
replaced Kelly in the short-term.
</P>
<P>
The FA welcomed the official announcement, which follows a
meeting with FIFA president Sepp Blatter a fortnight ago.
</P>
<P>
FA spokesman Steve Double said: "We gave a full report on the
matter to Sepp Blatter two weeks ago when David Davies and Geoff
Thompson went to Switzerland to meet him.
</P>
<P>
"It was made clear to us then that FIFA fully accepted our
version of events. We are pleased that they have publicly
confirmed that today," he said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Clinton Acquitted But Tarnished Forever </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
won bipartisan acquittal Friday in the Senate, concluding a
searing national drama that tarnished him forever as the second
president to be impeached.
</P>
<P>
Clinton "hereby is acquitted of the charges," declared Chief
Justice William Rehnquist after a somber Senate twice refused to
vote the two-thirds majority needed for conviction.
</P>
<P>
The first vote, on perjury, was 55-45 against, with 10
Republicans joining all 45 Democrats voting not guilty.
</P>
<P>
The second vote, on obstruction of justice, was 50-50, with
five Republicans breaking ranks to join the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, was
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in two articles of
impeachment in connection with his relationship with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky. The two articles were approved by
the House along partisan lines on December 19 last year.
</P>
<P>
Moments after the trial ended, Republicans bottled up an effort
led by Republican Senator Dianne Feinstein to censure Clinton for
"shameless, reckless and indefensible" behavior. Several Democrats
said they did not expect the issue to resurface when lawmakers
return to the Capitol after a break.
</P>
<P>
After a grueling five weeks, in which senators sat silently for
hours listening to legal arguments, it was a day for keepsakes.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton was exercising
in the White House when he received word of the first vote in a
phone call from his chief of staff, John Podesta. The president
had returned to work in time to learn he was finally free of the
threat of removal from office.
</P>
<P>
About wo hours after the Senate voting, Clinton declared he was
"profoundly sorry" for what he said and did in the Monica Lewinsky
affair that triggered it all.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that he was "humbled and very grateful for the
support and the prayers I have received from millions of Americans
over this past year. Now I ask all Americans, and I hope all
Americans here in Washington and throughout our land will
rededicate ourselves to the work of serving our nation and
building our future together."
</P>
<P>
The votes, coming several months after the dismissal of Paula
Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit, marked the second consecutive
major legal and political victory for Clinton. He still faces the
threat of an indictment from Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr,
either before or after he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
There had not been any doubt for weeks about the outcome, the
only suspense coming over whether either article of impeachment
would gain a majority. In the end, neither did.
</P>
<P>
Friday's verdicts were broadcast nationally to a public that
had long since said it wanted the trial over -- but seemingly
never tired of watching, reading and joking about it.
</P>
<P>
Lewinsky is expected to write a book and make several media
appearances in the coming months. Linda Tripp, whose tape-recorded
conversations with Lewinsky helped propel Starr's investigation,
is also embarking on a series of media appearances to refurbish
her image.
</P>
<P>
That investigation began in January 1998, when the nation awoke
to the shocking allegations that the president had had a sexual
relationship with the young woman in the White House.
</P>
<P>
His denials were famously forthright -- "I did not have sexual
relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky," he said a few days
later. But that depended, it later developed, on the definition of
sexual relations.

<HEADLINE> Human Capital Investment Important: Professor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Countries which have invested
in human capital and industrial physical capital formation will
have an easier time in economic recovery from the world financial
crisis, a professor at Columbia University in New York said Friday.
</P>
<P>
These crisis-hit countries will do better than those which have
invested in service industries or have over-consumed as a result
of overvalued currencies, Associate Professor of Economics and
Education Francisco Rivera-Batiz said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua on Friday, he said countries
adopting policies required to ease the crisis, such as cutting
budget deficits, increasing the regulation and supervision of the
banking industry could also fare better.
</P>
<P>
The professor, a Mexican, said a sustained recession in Brazil
may deeply affect its neighbors and its contagion effects may
affect more in the region.
</P>
<P>
"There are few countries in Latin America which are in a
position to sustain high economic growth in the next year", he
predicted.
</P>
<P>
"One should not expect a collapse like that in East Asia,
assuming that the U.S. economy continues to grow at its current
pace. If the U.S. were to go into recession, then the economic
situation in Latin America would be in more shaky ground," he
warned.
</P>
<P>
He said the terms and conditions set by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) to disburse funds have often been
counterproductive, pushing the economies further into recession
and hurting the poorest sectors there.
</P>
<P>
Industrialized nations have for the last ten years pushed for
an indiscriminate opening of financial markets in developing
countries to the world, but by pushing their own financial
self-interest, they "have led many emerging markets to jump into
quicksand, into which some have sunk", he said.
</P>
<P>
Rivera-Batiz is Director of the Economic Policy Management
Program for Emerging Markets, which is sponsored by the World Bank
and Columbia University. The project, with each term lasting about
one year, has been successful, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the graduates have been promoted to ministerial
positions and central banks and some are now close advisors of
presidents and economic policy makers in relevant countries.
</P>
<P>
The program focuses on applied economics with lectures
including Professor Jagdish Bhagwati, a key consultant behind the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) who spent a lot of
time helping formulate the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
"Countries must place a high premium on educating economic
policy makers. Improvement of the standard of living are dependent
on sound economic policy," Rivera-Batiz said.

<HEADLINE> China Pledges Support for SADC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- China emphasizes South-South
cooperation and supports Southern African countries "in their
efforts to maintain peace and stability, and promote regional
economic cooperation", a senior Chinese official said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
He Xiaowei, Assistant Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
cooperation, said at the closing meeting of the two-day
consultative conference of Southern African Development Community
(SADC) that China keeps fairly good bilateral ties with most
member counties of SADC and will continue to push forward such
friendly cooperative relations, as it always does.
</P>
<P>
Chine will continue to strengthen and expand cooperation with
SADC countries in trade, economic and technological cooperation
and investment, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said,"China will make special efforts to explore cooperation
in development of information technology and more Chinese
corporations and enterprises will be endowed with financial and
policy support to establish subsidiaries or joint ventures in SADC
countries."
</P>
<P>
He said that the world has entered the era of information, with
high- velocity development of high technology of computer, network
and information, whereas the accelerated pace of global
informatization, has become an important mark of 21st century's
knowledge economy.
</P>
<P>
Information technology began to play a more and more important
role in international competition, He said.
</P>
<P>
Compared with developed countries, informatization in China and
African countries still seems underdeveloped in many aspects, such
as average telephone density, length of optical fibre, number of
personal computers, information handling technology, utilization
rate of information materials and manufacturing of software, He
said.
</P>
<P>
China attaches great importance to the development of
information technology, especially the application and advancement
of computer network and information technology, the Chinese
official said.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Trying to Bring Fish to The Desert </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 12 (Xinhua) -- British scientists are working
with their colleagues in Israel, Denmark and Greece to develop a
technology which enables marine fish to be farmed in the desert.
</P>
<P>
The world-first project, being co-ordinated by environmental
geochemist Michael Krom at University of Leeds, UK, aims to
produce a working system within eighteen months.
</P>
<P>
It will help to provide people living in barren regions with "a
vital source of protein and a valuable, if unlikely, cash crop",
the university said Friday in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Growing marine fish in artificial environments is difficult
because the fish produce nitrogen-rich waste, which has to be
constantly removed.
</P>
<P>
One of the most crucial aspects of the new project will be
developing a cartridge to identify the presence of the toxic
hydrogen sulphide, and then remove it.
</P>
<P>
The new recirculating mariculture production system will also
be environmentally friendly, the university said.
</P>
<P>
A small-scale system will be built in the Negev desert at
Eilat, Israel, and will be home for thousands of seabream.
</P>
<P>
The researchers will monitor the system and develop a computer
model of the processes within it, to apply the technology on a
larger scale. A second, more advanced plant is already planned for
Greece.

OTTAWA, Feburary 12 (Xinhua) -- A Canadian coast guard ship
arrived on the scene Friday of a Greek freighter drifting off the
northwest coast of Vancouver Island, report says.
</P>
<P>
The container ship Hanjin Elizabeth lost power in high winds
and nine-metre seas, about 90 kilometres from land.
</P>
<P>
An ocean-going tug was dispatched from Seattle to tow the
260-metre ship to port.
</P>
<P>
None of the 24-member crew aboard the ship were injured in the
accident.
</P>
<P>
The coast guard vessel was standing by in case the 24 crew
members need to abandon the ship.
</P>
<P>
But officials said there is no immediate danger despite 35-knot
winds.
</P>
<P>
The ship became disabled because of damage to its main engines.
The Greek-flagged 43,966 dwt ship was bound for Seattle from
Tokyo.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Talks in Rambouillet Remain Deadlocked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 12 (Xinhua) -- The talks on a political
settlement to the conflict in Kosovo remained deadlocked Friday,
the fifth full day of the negotiations which began last Saturday
in Rambouillet southwest of Paris.
</P>
<P>
Britain, which is one of the co-chairmen of the talks, and NATO
have raised their tone criticizing the Serb side, while the Serb
leaders have accused Western countries of being unfair to the Serb
delegates and protecting the Albanian side.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook Thursday held the Serb
side responsible for the impasse of the talks, and NATO Secretary
General Javier Sonala Friday said that the unilateral signing of a
10-point peace framework by the Serb side is "little acceptable"
for the West.
</P>
<P>
The peace framework, presented by the Contact Group, calls for
high degree self-rule in Kosovo but no independence of the
province, as is claimed by the ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
NATO is preparing to reinforce its military deployment in
neighboring Macedonia in case a deal is struck on sending a
peacekeeping force to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Serbs have rejected the deployment of NATO force in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The Serb leaders have been sharpening their criticism of
Western mediators, accusing them of protecting the ethnic
Albanians while attacking the Serbs during the talks.
</P>
<P>
President of the Serb Republic Milan Milutinovic warned NATO of
a Vietnam style guerrilla warfare in Kosovo if the military
alliance launches air strikes against Serb forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He also accused the Western countries of protecting Albanians
at a press conference in Paris Friday, after he visited the Serb
delegates in Rambouillet.
</P>
<P>
Vice Prime Minister of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Vuk
Draskovic Friday accused the ethnic Albanians of imposing "an
ultimatum" by claiming the presence of the NATO force in Kosovo
prior to an acceptance of the Contact Group peace framework.
</P>
<P>
"The Albanian delegation has addressed an ultimatum as it
regards the acceptance by the Serb side of a presence of NATO
international peacekeeping force as a condition for signing the 10
principles of the Contact Group," said Draskovic in Belgrade upon
his return from Paris.
</P>
<P>
He accused the Albanian delegation of trying to make the Serb
side responsible for a failure of the talks in Rambouillet and
make the NATO force enter Kosovo to help the separatist group, the
Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the French television channel LCI,
Draskovic, who is a member of the Serb delegation, also expressed
his suspicion that the United States wishes to see a failure of
the Rambouillet talks.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will arrive in
Rambouillet Sunday "to evaluate the situation by herself," said
U.S. mediator Christopher Hill Friday.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference given in Rambouillet, Hill said that the
foreign ministers of the six-nation Contact Group will discuss the
situation of the talks Sunday for the first time since they were
started.
</P>
<P>
He said that although some progress has been made in the talks
over the past several days, especially in political fields, many
profound differences exist over some aspects of the text presented
by the Contact Group.
</P>
<P>
The Contact Group has given the Serb and Albanian delegates six
days to conclude an agreement, but an extra week could be extended
for the talks on condition that some progress has been achieved in
the first week.

<HEADLINE> SADC Identifies Goals in Information Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 12 (Xinhua) -- Southern African Development
Community (SADC) has identified six goals in the field of
information technology in order to keep pace with the rest of the
world, chairman of the SADC Council of Ministers, Alfred Nzo,
said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to a closing statement delivered by Nzo at the SADC
consultative conference, the first goal is to develop an
information society in southern Africa, to ensure that information
technology becomes entrenched in their daily lives.
</P>
<P>
Nzo, who is also South African Foreign Minister, said the
second goal is to improve and broaden equitable access to
information and communications technology.
</P>
<P>
The removing of trade barriers and restrictive licensing
practices and encouraging technology transfers from industrialized
countries in order to reduce costs related to information
technology, was seen as the third goal.
</P>
<P>
The fourth is to develop SADC wide information and
communication technology infrastructure, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The encouragement of the growth of software and hardware
development facilities in SADC through the increased development
of local information technology was taken as the fifth goal of the
regional group, with the sixth being the improvement of human
resource capacity in information technology.
</P>
<P>
This is a crucial factor for sustained development of
information technology.
</P>
<P>
Information technology is changing every aspect of human life
and the way societies interact, Nzo told the closing meeting.
</P>
<P>
He called for support for their endeavor from the developed
world, which not only is technologically advanced but also has the
human resource and financial capacity.
</P>
<P>
"For our part, we are committed to putting adequate resources
into information and communication technologies. This is because
we believe that these offer the possibility for the region to
leapfrog directly into information age without necessarily passing
through the usual phase of industrialization," Nzo said.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference was attended by SADC's 14 member
countries and international cooperating partners including Canada,
China, Cuba, Greece, Germany, Denmark, Japan and The World Bank.

Eurofighter jets.
