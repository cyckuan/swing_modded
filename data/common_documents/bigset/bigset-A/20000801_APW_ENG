   EDEN, Miss. (AP) -- An Amtrak train bound for Chicago was delayed
more than two hours after it struck part of a semitrailer crossing
the tracks in Yazoo County, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   No serious injuries were reported in Monday night's accident
near U.S. Highway 49 nine miles north of Yazoo City, Amtrak
spokesman Steven Taub said.
</P>
<P>
   About 135 passengers on ''The City of New Orleans'' waited from
the time of the crash at 7 p.m. until almost 9:30 p.m. while crews
repaired minor damage, Taub said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It could have been worse,'' Yazoo County Sheriff James
Williams said. ''It was bad it happened at all, but lucky no one
was injured.''
</P>
<P>
   Other details were not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   Taub said the authorized rail speed for that stretch is 79 mph.
The crash happened at a crossing without a guard arm.
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, these incidents happen quite a lot,'' Taub
said.

<HEADLINE> Northwest DC-10 makes emergency landing at Sea-Tac; two other incidents reported </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATAC, Wash. (AP) - Three unusual jetliner landings - but no
accidents - were reported Monday at Seattle-Tacoma International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   A Northwest Airlines DC-10 made an emergency landing about 2
p.m. after losing power in one of its three engines on takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest Flight 34, bound for Amsterdam, had 249 people aboard,
airport spokesman Bob Parker said. Those aboard the flight heard a
loud noise, and the engine was shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Pilots spent about 20 minutes dumping fuel and swinging around
for an emergency landing. Nobody was injured.
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, a Continental Airlines 737 reported it had a
possible problem with its flaps as it approached Sea-Tac on a
flight from Newark, N.J. Flight 123, with 154 people aboard, landed
with no problems.
</P>
<P>
   In the third incident, an Alaska Airlines MD-80 landed about 8
p.m. after reporting one of its two generators had gone off-line
after the plane left on a flight for San Jose, Calif. The plane has
two generators, plus an auxiliary power unit, but the pilot opted
to return to the airport after one of the generators failed,
airline spokesman Jack Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Flight 384 was carrying about 100 people.

<HEADLINE> Giants 4, Brewers 3, 11 Innings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (AP) -- Ellis Burks hit a leadoff home run in the 11th
inning, lifting the San Francisco Giants over the Milwaukee Brewers
4-3 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants had not gotten a hit since the second inning until
Burks connected off David Weathers (3-4).
</P>
<P>
   Brewers pitchers had retired 13 straight batters before Burks'
13th homer. Burks had a two-run single earlier in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Robb Nen got the final two outs for his 26th save and set a
major league record for saves in July at 14, one shy of the record
for any month.
</P>
<P>
   Felix Rodriguez (4-1) pitched two hitless innings for the win.
</P>
<P>
   At 19-8, the Giants tied their best record in July since moving
west in 1958. They also finished 19-8 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Geoff Jenkins hit a two-run homer in the fifth for the Brewers,
tying the score at 3. He also was hit by a pitch and scored on a
single by Jeromy Burnitz.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins' homer was the last hit for either team team until
Burks' shot.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco starter Mark Gardner went seven innings, allowing
four hits and three runs. He got a no-decision, leaving his
five-game winning streak intact.
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee starter Jimmy Haynes pitched six innings and did not
allow a hit over the last four. He struck out seven.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Mueller and Barry Bonds singled in the Giants first,
setting up Burks' two-run single. Burnitz had an RBI single in the
bottom half.
</P>
<P>
   Mueller drove in a run with a groundout in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Belliard opened the Brewers fifth with a triple that bounced
out of the glove of Burks in right field before he hit the wall.
With two outs, Jenkins hit his 18th homer.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Richie Sexson got his first hit with Milwaukee when he
singled to lead off the fourth. ... Milwaukee pitcher Kyle Peterson
will begin a 30-day rehab assignment with Class A Beloit. ...
Milwaukee's infield had made just one error in the last 12 games
until it committed two in the second inning on Monday. ...
Belliard's seventh triple tied a Milwaukee record for most in one
NL season.

<HEADLINE> Eric Lindros May Return to Flyers  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Eric Lindros waited until the final hours to
let the team that stripped him of his captain's job and made him an
outcast know if he would return.
</P>
<P>
   After a tumultuous season marked by a feud with general manager
Bob Clarke and four concussions in five months, Lindros was
expected to sign the Philadelphia Flyers' $8.5 million qualifying
offer.
</P>
<P>
   He had until 12:01 a.m. Tuesday to sign the offer sheet. Team
officials said Monday that Lindros had yet to sign, and they were
not sure when they would receive the fax.
</P>
<P>
   However, the team's offices closed at 9:30 p.m., so a signed
copy of the offer sheet could have been sitting in the tray of a
fax machine in an empty room.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got lots of time left today,'' Lindros said Monday
before participating in a charity golf tournament in Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't comment on anything at this point,'' Carl Lindros,
Eric's father and agent, said late Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The qualifying offer included a two-way contract that would
allow the Flyers to send Lindros to their AHL affiliate, the
Philadelphia Phantoms, and pay him a minor league salary of
$85,000.
</P>
<P>
   If Lindros signed the offer sheet, it doesn't guarantee he will
wear a Flyers uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros, still recovering from his sixth concussion, was
examined recently by Dr. James Kelly, a neurologist in Chicago, and
an independent doctor in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ''They both had similar timelines as far as December, January as
far as coming back playing,'' Lindros said. ''I'm going to continue
with my therapy and be ready when I'm ready. If I was to jump in at
the start of the year, I'd be playing with fire.''
</P>
<P>
   That could lead to further trouble with the Flyers because
Clarke has already said that the team's physicians believe Lindros
will be healthy enough to start the season.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros has a $20 million insurance policy that covers him this
season. If he doesn't play 20 games, the 27-year-old star center
will receive the full premium tax-free.
</P>
<P>
   When he submitted the qualifying offer, Clarke seemed to reach
out to Lindros, and call for a truce.
</P>
<P>
   ''On a personal level, I greatly regret the extent to which the
relationship between myself and Eric and his family has
deteriorated,'' Clarke said. ''I intend to do whatever I can to try
to move this relationship onto a better course.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later Clarke urged Lindros to look past their
contentious relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ''It'd be nice if we got along, but it's not necessary in my
opinion,'' Clarke said. ''You're a hockey player, you play for your
coach and your teammates. Lots of players don't like their
managers, but you still play for your teammates and that's what we
encourage him to look at.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindros had 28 goals and 32 assists in 57 games last season,
including four periods of the playoffs. He has made six All-Star
teams and won an MVP award in 1995, but the Flyers lost in their
only Stanley Cup final with him.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros came to Philadelphia in 1992 following a trade with
Quebec that included six players, two first-round draft choices and
$15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros' relationship with Clarke, his childhood hero,
deteriorated to a point last season where the two men didn't speak
for months.
</P>
<P>
   The boiling point came after Lindros criticized the team's
medical staff for failing to diagnose his second concussion of the
season on March 4.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke then stripped Lindros of his captaincy, and the star was
ostracized from the team until he returned for Games 6 and 7 of the
Eastern Conference finals against New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke had an even bigger problem with Lindros' parents. He
accused Carl and Bonnie Lindros of meddling in team matters and
running their son's life.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want his mom and dad. We've had enough of them,''
Clarke said after the season.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between the Lindros family and the Flyers
soured further after Lindros suffered a collapsed lung on April 1,
1999, in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   The potentially life-threatening injury was diagnosed the
following day. After the injury, Lindros and his family had little
confidence in the team's medical staff.

Republicans Open 37th National Convention
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Determined to send George W. Bush to the White House,
Republicans opened their 37th national convention Monday with a meticulously
scripted appeal to voters in the political middle. Colin Powell praised the
Texas governor's ''passion for inclusion,'' and bluntly challenged the GOP to
follow his lead. Bush knows ''that the party of Lincoln has not always carried
the mantle of Lincoln,'' Powell told delegates and a nationwide television
audience. ''He wants the Republican Party to wear that mantle again.''

-- did not include treason, although an investigation into that charge was still
underway, assistant Police Commissioner Moses Driver said. The charges also fell
outside an amnesty period granted between the time rebel gunmen led by Speight
stormed parliament on May 19 and the date that the last of their dozens of
hostages were released on July 13, Driver said.

<HEADLINE> Wildfires Rage in 10 Western States  </HEADLINE>
By BILL MARTINEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIDGECREST, Calif. (AP) -- Wildfires raged in 10 Western states
Monday, crackling through a half-million acres of timber, bush and
brush. One of the biggest fires burned untamed after incinerating
seven homes in a Sierra Nevada hamlet.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 50 blazes have blackened more than 538,000 acres in
Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico,
Utah, Washington and Wyoming in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   It's the worst fire season since 1988, when 5 million acres
burned in the West, said Michelle Barret, spokeswoman for the
National Interagency Fire Center in Boise, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were 2.2 million acres burned year-to-date in 1988.
We're already at 3.5 million and we're just coming into fire season
in most of the West,'' Barret said.
</P>
<P>
   Fire bosses said it would be weeks before some of the blazes
could be contained, and dry lightning forecast for Montana, Idaho,
Nevada and Oregon was expected to bring more blazes.
</P>
<P>
   ''The West is just in a terrible time,'' Barret said. ''Dry
lightning doesn't bode well for us. You couldn't write a more
dangerous situation than the one we have right now. In this game,
weather is everything.''
</P>
<P>
   With at least 10,714 firefighters deployed, resources stretched
thin and fatigue setting in, the Pentagon ordered up soldiers from
Fort Hood, Texas, and Marines from Camp Pendleton, Calif.,
</P>
<P>
   ''Hallelujah!'' Barret said. About 500 soldiers will arrive in
Idaho on Tuesday for on-the-job training. About 500 Marines are
expected to arrive in Boise on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The largest wildfire in California, a 63,275-acre inferno in
Sequoia National Forest, was burning on the eastern side of the
Southern Sierra, 120 miles north of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Seven homes -- including several mobile homes -- were destroyed
Saturday in the Kennedy Meadows area, a hamlet at the
6,000-foot-level on the south fork of the Kern River. Accessible
only by steep roads, the community is popular for camping and
fishing but is so remote it only got phone service last year.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the hamlet's 43 permanent residents fled when flames
moved through during the weekend. Those residents were still out of
their homes Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 1,600 firefighters, aided by the water-dropping sorties
of 17 helicopters and tankers, had it 15 percent surrounded Monday
with full containment estimated Aug. 10. There were 11 minor
firefighter injuries.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of six California fires, including a 3,000-acre blaze
burning five miles east of Temecula on the Pechanga Indian
Reservation and the Agua Tibia Wilderness of Cleveland National
Forest. Thirty cabins were briefly threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Some 700 firefighters and a dozen water-dropping air tankers and
helicopters had it 10 percent surrounded. Full containment was not
expected until Aug. 8.
</P>
<P>
   There were 13 wildfires in Idaho, including the 77,000-acre
Salmon-Challis National Forest blaze in the east-central area of
the state. In southeast Idaho, the 850-acre West Fork blaze,
threatened 10 homes and 10 commercial structures in Lava Hot
Springs.
</P>
<P>
   Montana firefighters battled nine fires, including a giant
six-blaze complex of fires that blackened 48,700 acres five miles
east of Ashland in the southeast corner of the state.
</P>
<P>
   In northeast Nevada, homes were threatened by the
lightning-caused 65,778-acre South Cricket grazing land fire 15
miles northeast of Wells. In the southeastern area, another fire
burning in 15,500 acres of pinion pine and juniper northeast of
Pioche, Nev., also threatened structures.

<HEADLINE> Tropical Storm Daniel Moving Away  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU (AP) -- Tropical Storm Daniel changed course away from
Hawaii as it gathered strength Monday, prompting the National
Weather Service to cancel all watches and warnings throughout the
state.
</P>
<P>
   The storm was centered about 225 miles east-northeast of
Honolulu and 150 miles east of Kahului, Maui, as of 5 p.m. HDT (11
p.m. EDT), National Weather Service forecaster Kevin Komada said.
It was moving west-northwest at about 12 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to stay far enough away where we're not going to
anticipate any effects,'' Komada said. ''We're going to be on the
extreme outer fringe and we're not looking for winds to be that
strong.''
</P>
<P>
   After weakening overnight, the storm began intensifying Monday
with winds reaching 70 mph, just below hurricane-strength winds of
at least 74 mph.
</P>
<P>
   That strengthening caused a new center of circulation to form
north of the previous track, pulling the storm further north away
from the islands, Komada said.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasters said data from radar and hurricane-tracking planes
showed that Daniel formed an eye early Monday. Then, just as
quickly, the eye disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ''It might briefly have become a hurricane,'' said Jim Weyman,
director of the Central Pacific Hurricane Center.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, a tropical storm warning was in effect for the
islands of Oahu, Maui, Molokai and Lanai, and a tropical storm
watch was in effect on Kauai. Those were canceled at 11 p.m. EDT.
</P>
<P>
   Maui County closed schools and county offices Monday, and state
officials told nonessential personnel to stay home. On Molokai,
officials closed the Kalaupapa National Historical Park.
</P>
<P>
   To the southeast, the storm caused few problems Sunday when it
came closest to the Big Island, Hawaii, bringing surf of up to 10
feet to east-facing beaches. Many beaches, trails and campsites
were closed.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers hoped the predicted heavy rains would bring some relief
to drought-stricken areas of the state, but forecasters said late
Monday that the most they could expect was some localized showers.

<HEADLINE> Countries Accused In S.Leone War  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United States and Britain publicly
accused Liberia and Burkina Faso on Monday of fueling the war in
Sierra Leone by helping its notorious rebels sell diamonds and buy
arms.
</P>
<P>
   ''The United States intends to support measures against both
Burkina Faso and Liberia unless they cease their support for the
war in Sierra Leone,'' U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke warned.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said the measures under consideration include
freezing the foreign assets of both countries and visa restrictions
on senior officials. Washington is also prepared to reexamine U.S.
assistance, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Liberian Foreign Minister Monie Captan demanded that the Western
powers present ''concrete evidence'' of the allegations that could
be examined by a panel of eminent persons. Burkina Faso's U.N.
Ambassador Michel Kafando also called for proof, but said his
government is also ''ready and willing'' to receive investigators
from the United Nations or any other source.
</P>
<P>
   In early July, the Security Council imposed a ban on the
purchase of Sierra Leone diamonds that don't have a government
certificate. It is a bid to strangle the ability of the rebel
Revolutionary United Front to finance the 9-year civil war that has
killed and maimed tens of thousands in the West African nation.
</P>
<P>
   The council's resolution referred to illegal diamonds being
shipped through neighboring Liberia but didn't mention Burkina
Faso.
</P>
<P>
   At Monday's town hall-style hearing by the Security Council
committee that monitors sanctions on Sierra Leone, the United
States and Britain went much further in pinpointing responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ''The governments of Liberia and Burkina Faso, including through
the actions of their presidents, are fueling the war in Sierra
Leone and profiting from the diamond trade,'' Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I appeal to them to end their support for the Revolutionary
United Front and to put a permanent halt to their involvement in
the diamonds for arms trade,'' he told the open meeting which
included representatives from governments, the diamond industry and
voluntary organizations.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering
delivered a similar message to Liberian President Charles Taylor
during a visit to West Africa in mid-July. Taylor reacted
defensively and took ''sharp issue'' with the evidence, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Liberia's diamond production in recent years is estimated at
between 100,000 and 150,000 carats, worth less than $10 million,
but it has exported 6 million carats of RUF diamonds worth $300
million, Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
   About 90 percent of Sierra Leone's diamond mines remain in rebel
hands and the United States estimates the RUF earns $30-50 million,
and perhaps as much as $125 million a year, from illicit diamond
sales, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The diamonds are being purchased by unidentified middlemen, many
Lebanese, who resell them to Belgian, South African, Israeli,
Indian, Russian and other buyers, Holbrooke said.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the diamond trade moves through Liberia, in the
late 1990s about 40 percent of smuggled Sierra Leone diamonds went
through Guinea, he said. Subsequently, significant quantities moved
through the Ivory Coast and Burkina Faso, probably for sale to
South African and European buyers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The money earned by the rebels is being used to buy more
sophisticated weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ''A year ago, the RUF were ... drug-crazed, machete-wielding
thugs. They are now acquiring machine guns, shoulder-fired
surface-to-air missiles and the means to shoot down aircraft,''
Holbrooke said. ''This is extraordinarily dangerous not only for
the region but for the United Nations,'' which has 13,000
peacekeepers in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Pattison, head of the United Nations Department in the
British Foreign Office, gave details of recent meetings between RUF
rebels and presidents Charles Taylor of Liberia and Blaise Compaore
of Burkina Faso.
</P>
<P>
   Three rebels -- one carrying diamonds to pay for Burkina Faso
''material support'' -- traveled with Taylor to a June 5 meeting
with Compaore in the Burkina Faso capital of Ouagadougou, he said.
On June 10, the same rebel leader flew to the Liberian capital,
Monrovia, to meet Taylor, carrying more diamonds to buy equipment,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor has arranged transport of arms, munition, food, fuel and
soldiers for the rebels and produced a plan to fortify the diamond
producing areas around Kono which the RUF implemented in June and
July, Pattison said.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to tighten his control of diamond production,
Taylor in June authorized establishment of a cover company in
Liberia -- the Liberian Investment Corporation -- with a subsidiary
in Burkina Faso to hide RUF mining operations in Sierra Leone, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Study: Convention Coverage Down  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- During half-time on ''ABC Monday Night
Football,'' play-by-play man Al Michaels squeezed in a 90-second
interview with ABC News' Peter Jennings in Philadelphia. Something
about a convention.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was on with the half-time hoopla at the Hall of Fame
Game.
</P>
<P>
   This is the year that coverage of political conventions became a
specialty item.
</P>
<P>
   At convention time in election years past, ABC, CBS and NBC went
wall-to-wall and head-to-head. But in covering Monday's opening of
the Republican National Convention, the broadcast networks devoted
less than two hours total in prime time.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's Jennings was back for an hour special when the football
game was over at 10 p.m. Eastern.
</P>
<P>
   So was CBS, with Dan Rather anchoring. But CBS' coverage had to
share the slot with ''48 Hours.'' The newsmagazine began with an
unrelated story that bumped the live address by prospective first
lady Laura Bush. Then the broadcast joined retired Gen. Colin
Powell's speech eight minutes late.
</P>
<P>
   To its credit, CBS stuck with Powell. ABC cut away five minutes
early as Jennings grandly referred to ABC News' 24-hour coverage
(on Web site ABC.com, that is).
</P>
<P>
   NBC News, which offered no broadcast coverage in prime time, had
the night's biggest (and arguably only) scoop. Interviewed on cable
network MSNBC, former President George Bush told correspondent
Jamie Gangel that if President Clinton doesn't knock off the
insults about his son George W. inside a month, ''I'm gonna tell
the nation what I think about him as a human being and a person.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the three broadcast networks met competitively at the
convention during just one 30-minute period: their regular nightly
newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   But signing off for ''NBC Nightly News,'' anchor Tom Brokaw told
viewers they could find him and more coverage by clicking on the
NBC News Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a dramatic new dimension to covering the convention
this time,'' he said. ''This truly is the first 'e-convention.'''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Robert Lichter had described this new dimension in less
rosy terms.
</P>
<P>
   ''The 'big three' networks have handed off much of the campaign
coverage to the 24-hour cable news networks and Internet sites,''
said Lichter, president of the Center for Media and Public Affairs,
a nonpartisan research and educational organization that studies
news and entertainment media.
</P>
<P>
   ''America is on the verge of having a subscription democracy,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Diminished airtime for political conventions by the broadcast
networks isn't anything new. But the three major television
networks this year have cut by a third the time devoted to the
presidential campaign as compared with 1996, according to a study
by the center released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The study examined news coverage by ABC, CBS and NBC from Jan. 1
to July 26, and found that evening news shows devoted 21 hours, 33
minutes to the presidential race this year.
</P>
<P>
   That compares to 32 hours, 18 minutes during the previous
presidential election year, meaning that more than a minute of
political coverage was shaved from each network show per night, the
study said.
</P>
<P>
   Up to now in this election season, CBS has had the steepest
decline, cutting coverage 43 percent from the 1996 election cycle,
the study said. ABC's coverage declined 38 percent and NBC's
coverage was down 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're not wired in,'' Lichter said, ''you're disconnected
from the political process.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite. During the convention, PBS is providing extensive
over-the-air coverage through the auspices of ''The NewsHour With
Jim Lehrer.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it seemed that with three all-news cable networks (up
from two in 1996), plus the supplemental Web sites of the broadcast
networks, this week's proceedings hadn't just been certified as an
e-convention. They were also transformed into a niche product for a
specialized audience.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the broadcast networks remained free to go on with
their customary mission -- feeding the larger appetite for
entertainment fare such as football, ''Big Brother'' or a ''Law &AMP;
Order'' rerun.

<HEADLINE> Albright To Meet Vatican Minister  </HEADLINE>
By ELLEN KNICKMEYER
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- The Vatican has something to offer Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright: its influence with the Palestinians in
prodding them toward accord with Israel on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican, for its part, wants something from the U.S-brokered
mediation on Jerusalem's final status: a say.
</P>
<P>
   Albright interrupted her flight home from an Asian tour to meet
Tuesday with the Vatican's foreign minister, Archbishop Jean-Louis
Tauran, on the failed Israeli-Palestinian talks at Camp David in
July.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican made clear during the talks that it, along with
Israel and the Palestinians, holds its own distinct position on the
city, sacred to Christians, Jews and Muslims alike.
</P>
<P>
   The talks deadlocked over rival claims by Israel and the
Palestinians to Jerusalem as a capital. Palestinians said they
would accept nothing less than full sovereignty over east
Jerusalem, home to all the city's most important religious sites.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican has a different vision for Jerusalem, long-held and
so strongly felt that Pope John Paul II publicly reminded Camp
David's powerbrokers of it during the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Urging all sides ''not to overlook the importance of the
spiritual dimension of the city of Jerusalem,'' John Paul repeated
the Holy See's insistence that international oversight -- ''a
special statute, internationally guaranteed'' -- would best
safeguard the city's holy sites and all its religions.
</P>
<P>
   In February, the Palestinians and the Vatican signed an accord
that, among other conditions regarding Palestinian territory, calls
for international safeguards of freedom of religion in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear if Arafat's insistence at Camp David on full
Palestinian sovereignty over east Jerusalem posed a conflict with
that accord.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has a long history with John Paul, who has met with the
Palestinian leader a half-dozen times starting in 1982, when Israel
still was calling Arafat a terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul was saying two decades ago that he saw Israel and
Palestinians both as having a right to their own homelands.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, a week after an icebreaking handshake with then-Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Arafat said in Rome that he saw
that city as a model for the ultimate status of Jerusalem. The
Vatican is a sovereign state within Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want Jerusalem to be a city open to Israelis and
Palestinians, exactly like Rome is the capital of the Vatican and
of Italy,'' Arafat said on a trip to lobby for Italian and Vatican
support.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Jerusalem question could make the peace process fail -- or
become the symbol of peaceful coexistence among Muslims, Christians
and Jews,'' Arafat said, prophetically, then.

Republicans Open 37th National Convention
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Determined to send George W. Bush to the White House,
Republicans opened their 37th national convention Monday with a meticulously
scripted appeal to voters in the political middle. Colin Powell praised the
Texas governor's ''passion for inclusion,'' and bluntly challenged the GOP to
follow his lead. Bush knows ''that the party of Lincoln has not always carried
the mantle of Lincoln,'' Powell told delegates and a nationwide television
audience. ''He wants the Republican Party to wear that mantle again.''

Countries Accused In S.Leone War

   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United States and Britain publicly accused Liberia
and Burkina Faso on Monday of fueling the war in Sierra Leone by helping its
notorious rebels sell diamonds and buy arms. ''The United States intends to
support measures against both Burkina Faso and Liberia unless they cease their
support for the war in Sierra Leone,'' U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke warned.
U.S. officials said the measures under consideration include freezing the
foreign assets of both countries and visa restrictions on senior officials.
Washington is also prepared to reexamine U.S. assistance, the officials said.

outside an amnesty period granted between the time rebel gunmen led by Speight
stormed parliament on May 19 and the date that the last of their dozens of
hostages were released on July 13, Driver said.

<HEADLINE> 3 Odd Landings at Northwest Airport  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATAC, Wash. (AP) -- Three unusual jetliner landings were
reported Monday at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   A Northwest Airlines DC-10 made an emergency landing about 2
p.m. after losing power in one of its three engines on takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   Northwest Flight 34, bound for Amsterdam, had 249 people aboard,
airport spokesman Bob Parker said. Pilots spent about 20 minutes
dumping fuel and swinging around for an emergency landing. No one
was injured.
</P>
<P>
   A short time later, a Continental Airlines 737 reported it had a
possible problem with its flaps as it approached Sea-Tac on a
flight from Newark, N.J. Flight 123, with 154 people aboard, landed
with no problems.
</P>
<P>
   In the third incident, an Alaska Airlines MD-80 landed about 8
p.m. after reporting one of its two generators had gone offline
after the plane left for San Jose, Calif. The plane has two
generators, plus an auxiliary power unit, but the pilot opted to
return to the airport, airline spokesman Jack Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Flight 384 was carrying about 100 people.

<HEADLINE> States Seek Congressional Districts  </HEADLINE>
By P. SOLOMON BANDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- At least five Western states are on track to land
new congressional seats as a result of the census, but more
representation doesn't necessarily translate into more political
clout.
</P>
<P>
   Census Bureau figures released Monday project an 8 percent
increase in the voting-age population in the West, the largest
regional jump in the nation since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The South had the second largest jump, with its voting-age
population growing by nearly 6 percent, the bureau reported.
Georgia and Florida are expected to gain one seat apiece.
Nationally, the voting-age population grew by 4.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   California, Colorado, Montana and Nevada each is expected to
gain one congressional district, while Arizona and Texas each is
expected to gain two, according to a study by Election Data
Services of Washington, D.C. New Mexico and Utah are not projected
to gain seats.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're still not going to match the power of New York, or
Texas, or Florida,'' said Katy Atkinson, a Denver political
consultant who usually works with Republicans. ''We're just talking
about one seat here, one seat there, which really won't shift power
in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would take a huge shift in population and I don't think
that such a huge shift will take place.''
</P>
<P>
   The process to create congressional districts and redraw
boundaries will begin after the census. The new seats will be in
place for the 2002 elections.
</P>
<P>
   If census projections hold, Republicans may benefit more than
Democrats, analysts predicted. California is the only one of the
five Western states expected to gain seats that is controlled by
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the artifacts of the West is that these states also
have a higher percentage of Republicans,'' said University of
Colorado political science professor Scott Adler. ''You're likely
to see these states gaining seats, but probably gaining Republicans
in those seats.''

   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- At least two people were killed and
17 others injured in explosions at a carnival and a Roman Catholic
cathedral in the southern Philippines, officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   One explosion ripped through a town festival in Monkayo, 580
miles southeast of Manila on the island of Mindanao late Monday,
killing two men and injuring 16 others, police said. Investigators
could not conclude who was responsible, said regional police
spokesman Hermelino Bermoy.
</P>

   Also late Monday, a grenade exploded near the cathedral in the
Muslim-dominated town of Jolo, 250 miles southwest of Monkayo,
injuring one man, the military's Southern Command said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third grenade blast in less than two weeks in the
town on Jolo island, where Muslim extremists are holding 29
hostages, including 15 foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Muslim separatist rebels have been blamed for other recent
bombings in the southern Philippines, but some explosions have been
triggered by quarrels among local residents.

<HEADLINE> Peres' Defeat a Familiar Role  </HEADLINE>
By DINA KRAFT
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The color drained from Shimon Peres' face as
the tally of votes was read aloud. Once again, he had lost an
election.
</P>
<P>
   The Nobel peace laureate and former Israeli prime minister --
celebrated more abroad than in his own country -- found himself cast
in the familiar role of loser, defeated in Monday's poll of the
Knesset's 120 legislators by a relative unknown in the election for
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The eloquent elder statesmen and master politician, thought a
shoo-in for the ceremonial post, gained only 57 votes. The other 63
went to Moshe Katsav, an underwhelming legislator from the hawkish
Likud Party.
</P>
<P>
   Peres may have the most impressive resume in Israel's
parliament. His career spans the country's 52 year history -- from
the man responsible for developing Israel's nuclear capacity in the
1950s, to an architect of the Israeli-Palestinian peace process.
</P>
<P>
   He has served in each of the top four posts: defense minister,
finance minister, foreign minister, prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Persuading elected officials to hire him was never a problem.
Getting elected himself was.
</P>
<P>
   He lost four elections for prime minister, and tied for one in
1984. That led to a ''rotation'' agreement with the other
candidate, Yitzhak Shamir; Peres served from 1984-86.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1995 he took office for a second time after the
assassination of Yitzhak Rabin. He served until May 1996, when he
was narrowly defeated by hard-liner Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   An architect of the breakthrough Oslo Accords, launching the
peace process with the Palestinians, Peres shared the 1994 Nobel
Peace Prize with Rabin and Yasser Arafat. Although he is revered
abroad as a statesman, hawks at home say he is too conciliatory to
Israel's Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Legislator Eli Goldschmidt of Peres' One Israel faction said it
was hard to watch Peres lose another race.
</P>
<P>
   ''Apparently, a person's greatness does not necessarily
translate into an ability to win elections,'' Goldschmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak also was caught off-guard by the
defeat -- until Sunday, media counts said 65 legislators were with
Peres, only 45 were with Katsav and 10 were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   ''My heart today is with Shimon Peres who has contributed his
entire life to the security and peace of Israel,'' Barak told the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately it was the powerful ultra-Orthodox Shas party that
turned the tide.
</P>
<P>
   Party officials said all 17 Shas legislators voted for Katsav
after their spiritual leader Rabbi Yitzhak Kadouri had a vision
that Katsav -- an observant Jew -- was favored by the heavens.
</P>
<P>
   Peres' fellow lawmakers blamed ethnic politics. Shas has built a
following decrying discrimination of Sephardic Jews of Middle
Eastern by the country's elite of Ashkenazi Jews of European
descent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his many years in government, the Iranian-born Katsav
campaigned as the underdog who rose from humble origins.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was not a proper vote, it was an ethnic vote,'' said Labor
lawmaker Colette Avital.
</P>
<P>
   Peres was welcomed back to his home north of Tel Aviv Monday
night by a drum-beating crowd of supporters, chanting ''Peres, the
nation is with you.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We will continue to work for peace and won't give up,'' Peres
called out in response.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Israel Television, Peres' daughter said the
religious legislators missed the mark when they failed to choose
the man whose career was marked first by securing the Jewish
state's capacity to defend itself -- and then by securing its
peaceful existence.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hear they say Katsav keeps the (biblical) commandments -- but
my father actually fulfills them,'' said Tsvia Valdan.

<HEADLINE> Book Helps ID Bosnia War Victims  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- A book containing pictures
of personal belongings found on bodies discovered near Srebrenica
has helped dozens of families identify relatives missing from
nearly five years ago in the worst massacre of the Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   Between 7,000 and 10,000 Muslim men were believed to have been
systematically killed when Serb forces overrun the eastern enclave
of Srebenica in 1995. Thousands were buried in mass graves around
the town. Others were left unburied.
</P>
<P>
   Since June 19, the International Committee of the Red Cross has
been showing the book containing photographs of torn clothes,
boots, socks and other personal items found on about 300 recovered
remains to people whose relatives are among the missing.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, dozens of victims have been identified, according
to Amor Masovic, head of the Muslim Commission for Missing Persons
in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every day, families call saying they recognized in the book
the clothes of their beloved and we then combine the clothes with
the body,'' he said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   So far 4,000 bodies have been found and are being stored in a
morgue in Tuzla in northern Bosnia. Only a few have been identified
because of the advanced state of decomposition and lack of
sufficient dental and other records.
</P>
<P>
   The book offers the best chance of bringing closure to at least
some of the victims' families, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We absolutely hit the nail on the head with this book,''
Masovic said.
</P>
<P>
   Nine specially trained Red Cross teams carefully go through the
book with family members, trying to help them find an item by which
they can recognize a victim.
</P>
<P>
   Of tens of thousands of pictures taken, only those that would
cause the least pain were printed in 500 copies of the book:
various jackets, underwear, a sweat shirt emblazoned with ''Los
Angeles,'' snapshots of laughing children at birthday parties or of
smiling men carrying a case of beer.
</P>
<P>
   The items testify to the victims' lives and last moments.
</P>
<P>
   For five years already, families of the victims have been
demanding to know the fate of their sons, brothers, fathers and
husbands. Without recognizing a body and giving it a decent burial,
some families fill their days and nights with expectations that
maybe someday, somewhere, by some miracle, their dearest will be
found alive.
</P>
<P>
   The success achieved with the book made the Muslim commission
and the Red Cross consider widening the project and printing books
with items found on bodies in other mass graves in Bosnia and maybe
in the region of Serbia and Croatia too, Masovic said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have millions of photos from exhumations and turning them
into books means getting good results for minimum investment,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether any plans were made for a common book with
pictures of items found on Muslim, Serb and Croat victims of the
war could be published, Masovic said his Serb and Croat colleagues
do not have the same problem.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the Bosnian 1992-95 war, the Serb Commission
for Missing Persons exhumed about 1,500 Serb bodies and the Croat
Commission about 450.
</P>
<P>
   ''So, they have more time to do the identification,'' Masovic
said. ''We have exhumed 8,704 bodies so far, of which 4,000 only
around Srebrenica.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 80 percent of the bodies found elsewhere by the Muslim
Commission were identified. But from the 4,000 Srebrenica bodies,
only 76 were identified before the book came out.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should have done this book in 1996,'' Masovic said.

<HEADLINE> Indian High-Tech Workers Homesick  </HEADLINE>
By MIA PENTA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- When Anjali Sikka's husband got a job at
Microsoft three years ago, she had to leave friends, family and the
security she felt in her hometown in India.
</P>
<P>
   She struggled to adapt to her new home in Seattle. Finding
simple things -- her favorite lentils, a beauty parlor -- became a
chore. But mostly, Sikka was desperate to find other Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than lose sight of the culture left behind by Sikka and
other transplants lured by the high-tech industry, Indians in
Seattle are networking and starting businesses -- from restaurants
to movie theaters -- that give them a taste of home.
</P>
<P>
   ''Being new to Seattle, it's hard to find people from your same
hometown,'' said Sikka, 26. ''You miss what you are familiar
with.''
</P>
<P>
   Sikka started a Web site, seattleguru.com, to help relocated
Indians find the area's nearly 200 Indian businesses, from child
care to doctors to jewelers. It also helps them find roommates or
apartment buildings where other Indians live.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's your own people, your own language. Even though you are
far away from home, you feel closer,'' said Arif Azhar, whose
family owns the Roxy Theater in Renton.
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech industry, in need of specialized workers, has been
tapping foreign countries -- India, in particular. Suresh Ramal, an
information analyst at the Indian Embassy in Washington, D.C., said
technology plays a large part in the emergence of Indian
communities across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That growth has been largest in California, Texas and New York,
all of which have Indian populations over 60,000, according to the
embassy.
</P>
<P>
   In Seattle, the 1990 Census -- taken before the region's
high-tech industry took off -- reported nearly 4,000 Indian
residents. But, according to the embassy, the population has grown
as high as 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. is among the top 10 companies that employs
workers on high-tech visas, with 8 percent of its 20,000 employees
in the region from other countries.
</P>
<P>
   That trend could continue as the high-tech industry heavily
lobbies Congress to issue more high-tech visas, which let
college-educated foreigners work up to six years in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Juma visits Paramjit Kaur's beauty shop in Kent every two
weeks to have her eyebrows plucked the Indian way -- by quickly
looping thread around the hairs and yanking them out.
</P>
<P>
   Kaur ''does it the way I'm used to,'' Juma said. ''When she
finally opened her shop, I was like, 'Yes, finally I get what I
want.'''
</P>
<P>
   Before her wedding, Alpna Sharma went to the parlor because she
needed someone who could do mehndi -- intricately designed temporary
henna tattoos on the hands and feet of Indian brides, considered
symbols of happiness.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a part of tradition,'' she said. ''It's something I want
to continue. Growing up here, it's easy to lose your culture.''

<HEADLINE> Carruth Defendant Pleads Guilty  </HEADLINE>
By JENNA FRYER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- A man accused of shooting the girlfriend
of former Carolina Panthers receiver Rae Carruth pleaded guilty to
second-degree murder Monday, a prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   Van Brett Watkins also pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit
first-degree murder, intent to kill an unborn child and shooting
into occupied property, said assistant district attorney Gentry
Caudill.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins admitted in court that he fired the gun that killed
Cherica Adams, Caudill said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We anticipate that he will testify in the other cases,'' the
prosecutor said.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins, Carruth, Michael Eugene Kennedy and Stanley Drew
''Boss'' Abraham all were charged with first-degree murder,
conspiracy and intent to kill an unborn child in the Nov. 16
shooting. Watkins and Kennedy also were charged with discharging a
firearm into occupied property.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins' lawyer, Claire Rauscher, refused to comment on the plea
or on the possibility that Watkins would testify.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins faces more than 50 years in prison but won't be
sentenced until after Carruth and the two other men are tried.
During Monday's hearing, prosecutors said they hoped to try the
defendants together in October.
</P>
<P>
   Carruth's lawyer, David Rudolf, said Watkins' testimony can't
hurt his client ''if he tells the truth, which is that Mr. Carruth
had nothing to do with this.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams was shot four times from a passing vehicle as she drove
her car in a Charlotte suburb. She was pregnant with Carruth's
child at the time. The boy was delivered by emergency Caesarean
section hours after the shooting. Adams died Dec. 14.
</P>
<P>
   Carruth has been out of action since October with an ankle
injury. He was in the third year of a four-year, $3.7 million
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins' plea came just two weeks after reports that prosecutors
had called off any bargains that would have allowed the defendants
to plead guilty to second-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
   It also came the same day that a judge held a hearing to
determine how much child support Carruth should pay for his son,
Chancellor Adams.
</P>
<P>
   At the child support hearing, psychologist Jonathan Gould argued
that Carruth should be allowed supervised, videotaped visits with
his son. Carruth is being held in jail without bond, so Gould
suggested the visits could be held in a conference room adjacent to
the jail library.
</P>
<P>
   Gould's report was admitted into evidence, then sealed by Judge
Yvonne Mims Evans. Evans said she would rule on the visitation
request Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Adams' parents, Saundra Adams and Jeffrey Moonie, have sued
Carruth for custody of the child and for child support. Saundra
Adams has temporary custody.
</P>
<P>
   Moonie, visibly upset, declined to comment on Watkins' plea.

<HEADLINE> Quake Shakes Indonesia's Capital  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- A magnitude 5.5 earthquake shook the
capital of Jakarta early Tuesday, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   There were no reports of injuries or damage.
</P>
<P>
   The quake hit at 1:59 a.m. and was centered beneath the Java
Sea, 155 miles northwest of Jakarta, said seismologist Soehardjono
of the meteorological agency.
</P>
<P>
   A magnitude 5 quake can cause considerable damage if located
near an urban area. Indonesia is prone to earthquakes because of
its location on the Pacific ''Ring of Fire'' -- a line of
volcanically active areas stretching from the western coast of the
Americas across to Japan, Southeast Asia and the South Pacific.

<HEADLINE> Ex-President Bush Sharing a Salute  </HEADLINE>
By WALTER R. MEARS
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Politics has been the family calling for
three generations, yet George W. Bush dismisses talk of a dynasty.
Still, his legacy is on the ticket and in his shadow Cabinet as he
seeks to reclaim the White House his father lost eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
   George W. would not be where he is without the family name.
Taking that advantage without overplaying it is not an easy course.
</P>
<P>
   Former President Bush and his wife, Barbara, drew an opening
ovation when they appeared in the VIP gallery at the Republican
National Convention Monday night. ''We are so proud of you, the
entire Bush family,'' Rep. Henry Bonilla of Texas told them.
</P>
<P>
   George Bush, former President Gerald R. Ford, and Nancy Reagan
take the convention's salute Tuesday night. But the role of the
elder Bush is a limited one. No prime time speech as when Ronald
Reagan played to the cheers of the 1988 convention, urging
Republicans to ''win one more for the Gipper'' by helping Bush
succeed him.
</P>
<P>
   Too much George Bush at this convention could play into the
Democrats' contention that George W. is trying to win a replay
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   There is no denying the father's impact, and Bush doesn't
pretend otherwise. ''After all, it wasn't but two years after he
left the presidency that two of his sons ran for governor,'' Bush
said in an interview with USA Today. George W. won his first Texas
term in 1994; brother Jeb lost that year but now is governor of
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Their grandfather was a winning politician, too, Sen. Prescott
Bush of Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   On his way to the presidential nomination, George W. Bush called
the father-son impact ''the John Adams and John Q. factor.'' They
were the only father and son ever elected presidents, six terms
apart in 1796 and 1824.
</P>
<P>
   Bush seeks to succeed the man who beat his father eight years
ago. President Clinton is campaigning for his designated political
heir, Vice President Al Gore, and taunting Bush as he does so.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nearest I can tell, the message of the Bush campaign is 'How
bad could I be? I've been governor of Texas. My daddy was
president. I own a baseball team. They like me down there.' ''
</P>
<P>
   George Bush's place in the campaign of George W. became a
sensitive point with the Republican nominee when critics said that
the former president had pushed his son to choose Dick Cheney for
vice president, implying that the younger Bush was not making his
own decisions. Cheney was President Bush's secretary of defense.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bush said that they talked about the choice and that it was
no sign of weakness for a man to get advice from his father. But he
said the decision was based on his own work with Cheney as a
campaign adviser and was his alone.
</P>
<P>
   Colin Powell, the general George Bush made chairman of the joint
chiefs of staff, and Condoleezza Rice, a national security adviser
in the Bush White House, surely would be major figures in a George
W. Bush administration. Bush has hinted that Powell might be his
secretary of state. Ms. Rice, Bush's chief adviser on foreign
policy, could play the same role in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Both are black, both had prime time speech slots at the
Republican National Convention. Introducing Powell via satellite TV
Monday night, Bush said ''I hope his greatest service to America
might still lie ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   There surely would be other Bush veterans in a new Bush
government, hardly surprising because it fits the pattern of both
parties. The officials of one administration are the logical
recruits for another.
</P>
<P>
   Connections and comparisons of father and son are constant and
inevitable, as when George W. not only pledged no new taxes but
promised cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ''Read my lips, no new taxes,'' George Bush vowed from every
platform in his 1988 campaign, but reneged on the pledge as
president. George W. said after his father's defeat that it was a
self-inflicted wound.
</P>
<P>
   ''Breaking his pledge cost him credibility and weakened his
base,'' George W. said.
</P>
<P>
   He is on record with a comparable pledge. ''This is not only no
new taxes,'' he said in a campaign debate on Jan. 16. ''This is tax
cuts, so help me God.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Bush made only a handful of campaign appearances for
his son during the primaries, campaigning for a day in Iowa, for an
afternoon in New Hampshire, the latter event marked by an inadroit
phrase.
</P>
<P>
   ''This boy, this son of ours, is not going to let you down,''
the former president said. With critics then, and still, trying to
make inexperience an issue against Bush, ''boy'' was not the image
his campaign wanted left with voters.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the idea of a Bush dynasty. George W. counters that
suggestion by saying that he isn't trying to win on an inheritance,
but by earning trust and votes.
</P>
<P>
   Bush favors the description of his political heritage Powell
offered in urging his election.
</P>
<P>
   ''He is a man who comes from a family with a generations-long
tradition of public service,'' Powell said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bush Eager To Tell U.S. His Plans  </HEADLINE>
By LAURIE KELLMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- George W. Bush is eager to tell the
country about his plans to ''use these good times for great
purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   The GOP nominee-to-be is working his way to the Republican
National Convention by stumping through battleground states won by
Democrats in 1996 and 1992, including Arkansas, Missouri, Kentucky
and Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   ''But not this time, not this year,'' Bush said Monday in a
satellite remarks to the gathering in Philadelphia after his wife's
prime-time convention speech.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've seen thousands of people. The crowds have been big and
the enthusiasm even bigger,'' he said from a classroom at
Westerville South High School. ''And I cannot wait to stand before
you Thursday night and tell America how I want to use these good
times for great purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush arrives in Philadelphia on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas governor watched his wife with a group of honor
students while waiting to go on camera himself.
</P>
<P>
   Seated in a school chair, he grinned proudly as she took the
stage. ''She looks great,'' he said. Then, as Laura Bush said she
was ''honored to open this convention that will nominate my husband
for president of the United States,'' Bush joked, ''I wrote that
line for her.''
</P>
<P>
   In his convention remarks, Bush recalled his premarital pledge
to Laura -- the one about her never having to deliver a political
speech.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know you're as glad as I am that she didn't hold me to that
promise,'' he told the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Bush will deliver more broad-themed, short speeches
described as practice runs for the 3,900-word address that he
delivers Thursday night to accept the Republican nomination for
president.
</P>
<P>
   The Bushes practiced their speeches separately, but in front of
about a dozen friends and staff members Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''I wanted to see her speech on first delivery,'' Bush said.
''Nor did she help me practice mine.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Monday, Bush attended rallies at the University of
Dayton, a private Catholic college, and in the Senate atrium of
Ohio's state Capitol in Columbus. In both places, he sounded many
of the themes he is expected to raise in his convention speech.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got a lot of work to do, and I'm ready to do the work,''
he told the Columbus audience. He said Americans were ''sick and
tired of the politics of tearing people down.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats held a competing rally a few blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in Dayton, Bush proclaimed, ''Ours is not the politics
of personal destruction'' and pledged to wage ''a campaign of
hopefulness.'' He also promised to ''keep the peace'' and
strengthen America's military.
</P>
<P>
   As with most recent Bush rallies, only those with invitations
were allowed up front. Still, a group of about two dozen people
with Gore signs chanted ''Al Gore'' on the edge of the rally.
</P>
<P>
   Bush ignored the group, but Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, turned to
them and said, ''The First Amendment is alive and well. We welcome
our friends.''

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Bush Launches Convention  </HEADLINE>
By KALPANA SRINIVASAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Out from behind her husband's shadow, Laura
Bush is carving her own path in the campaign that could lead her to
the East Wing of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   She charmed delegates Monday night with her rousing kickoff
speech at the GOP convention. An increasingly valuable asset in
Gov. George W. Bush's presidential bid, she planned to return to
his side on the campaign trail Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   She comes back here later this week to show off yet another
facet of her campaign role at a major fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   At the convention, the delegates greeted the Texas first lady
exuberantly, amid a shower of metallic streamers and red, white and
blue confetti. She drew a standing ovation when she suggested that
voters want to return respect to the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   America wants a leader who reflects ''its heart and its values
and its leadership in the world,'' Mrs. Bush said. ''They will be
looking for someone to uphold that honor and that trust.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the Texas governor would fulfill those dreams.
</P>
<P>
   ''He shares credit and doesn't cast blame,'' she said. ''He sets
a tone that's positive and constructive, a tone that's very
different from the bitterness and division that too often
characterize Washington, D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   The former librarian and schoolteacher walked on stage to the
Jackson Five classic ''ABC,'' setting the tone for a speech framed
around her experience and interest in education.
</P>
<P>
   She pledged that if her husband is elected, she will focus her
attention on the issues she has championed in Texas, such as early
childhood development and reading and learning.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty students from a Houston charter school sat in desks
behind her. They recited multiplication charts and chanted, ''There
are no shortcuts'' before Mrs. Bush took center stage.
</P>
<P>
   Referring not-so-indirectly to Vice President Al Gore, Mrs. Bush
noted that her husband's opponent sometimes spends a night at a
teacher's home before visiting a school.
</P>
<P>
   ''George spends every night with a teacher,'' said Mrs. Bush,
53, to a round of cheers. The pair wed in 1977 in Midland, Tex.,
where they both grew up.
</P>
<P>
   Standing next to her state's delegation in the center of the
convention hall, Minnesota Secretary of State Mary Kiffmeyer said
she ''loved that line ... There's a quality about Laura Bush, a
genuineness, a sensitivity, and I think the American people are
looking for that kind of First lady,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Bush credited her husband for working to make education
more accessible to young adults, recounting how the couple used to
read Dr. Seuss stories to their daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the major reasons George is running for president is to
make sure every child in America has that same opportunity to grow
up reading,'' said Mrs. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   She looked out at more than a few friendly faces. The Bushes'
twin daughters, Jenna and Barbara, sat beside the candidate's
parents -- former President and Barbara Bush. Laura Bush's mother,
Jenna Welch also watched from the audience.

   The governor caught his wife's address from an Ohio high school,
where he stood with a group of honor students. Grinning proudly as
she took the stage, he said, ''She looks great.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he told the delegates via satellite: ''You heard from
the best speaker in the family.''
</P>

reminded me just how much I love her,'' he said.

<P>
   Mrs. Bush said she can attest to the candidate's unswerving
principles, having sat beside him during his ups and downs in
politics and in baseball, referring to his time as a managing
partner with the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   ''His core principles will not change with the winds of polls or
politics or fame or fortune or misfortune,'' Mrs. Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   She is certain that her husband will one day ''be a fabulous
grandfather. In the meantime he'll make a great president,'' she
quipped.

<HEADLINE> Spotlight Is Fleeting for Doles  </HEADLINE>
By TED ANTHONY
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- They claim center stage once more Tuesday
night, surrounded by admirers, warmed by effusive praise, carrying
the GOP's message with the same fervor. But this time, for Bob and
Elizabeth Dole, the spotlight is fleeting and a bit less bright.
</P>
<P>
   He returns as an elder statesman -- the 20th-century war hero,
the gentleman legislator from Kansas, the totem to be treated with
deference. Her role is now dual -- the would-be first lady of 1996
and, more recently, the presidential candidate who could have made
Bob Dole America's first first man. And yet both are saddled with
campaign-season failures.
</P>
<P>
   It's an unusual situation that creates an unusual dilemma for
Republicans: What role should these GOP stalwarts play at the 2000
convention of the self-described party of the future?
</P>
<P>
   ''She's without a doubt the top woman in the party. He
represents patriotism and people who have served their country
selflessly,'' says Roger Hartley, a public affairs specialist at
Roanoke College in Virginia. ''They're still very important to the
Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly neither Dole is absent here, either physically or in
spirit.
</P>
<P>
   The senator, in addition to addressing the convention Tuesday
night, is ''working'' as a ''correspondent'' for Comedy Central,
trading on the dry wit he has untethered of late and generally
being a ''senior something'' -- the way he described himself last
month. He doesn't seem at all, well, doleful.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a good ticket and we did our best and we didn't win. We
accept responsibility for that,'' a relaxed Dole said Monday night
on CNN's ''Larry King Live.'' ''But it looks good this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole, also scheduled to speak in prime time Tuesday,
promised when she withdrew from the presidential race in October
that she was ''a long way from twilight.'' On Monday, at a fete
sponsored by the Lifetime Network honoring her accomplishments as
Cabinet member, Red Cross chief and successful woman, Florida Rep.
Tillie Fowler predicted an even brighter future.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what mountain Elizabeth Dole will climb next,''
Fowler said. ''But I do know this: She has always been ahead of her
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding a place for vanquished candidates can be a thorny issue.
The Democrats waited years to offer group hugs to the defeated
George McGovern (1972) and Walter Mondale (1984). Michael Dukakis
(1988) is still waiting. On the Republican side, it took years
before Richard Nixon overcame the stigma of resignation and was
welcomed home.
</P>
<P>
   President Bush, who lost to Bill Clinton in 1992, is a different
story. First off, he actually served as president; second, with
Ronald Reagan ailing and unavailable, he offers a convenient bridge
between the adored Reagan years and the Republicans' anticipated
administration of George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Bob and Elizabeth Dole somewhere in the middle --
associated with good eras and accomplishments but hobbled a bit by
recent defeats. Yet some say name recognition alone can carry the
day for them -- especially him.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of it depends on how you've been beaten, whether you
were gracious in defeat and the overall tenor of the campaign,''
says Rick Hardy, a University of Missouri political scientist who
worked on Republican Fred Thompson's aborted 1996 presidential run.
Dole, he says, is ''a man that didn't shame the Republican Party,
even in defeat.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., says Dole's ''deep
reservoir of support'' and longtime presence in the GOP would
''make it kind of strange not to have him around.'' Former national
Republican Chairman Haley Barbour speaks of the ''affection and
nostalgia'' people hold for Dole.
</P>
<P>
   And Kansas Gov. Bill Graves, chairman of his state's delegation,
expects Dole to be welcomed throughout the week; people, Graves
said, remember him as ''the total package as a public servant.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Bob Dole,'' says Graves, ''is still one of the bright stars of
the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   And so the Doles step forward again, not the center of attention
but proving that two intersecting, incredibly circuitous political
careers have a few more twists and turns left.
</P>
<P>
   ''I kind of like people rediscovering Bob Dole,'' says Alfred
Eckes, former executive director of the Republican Caucus of the
House of Representatives and now an Ohio University history
professor.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's not a 24-hour meteor. His public life demonstrated
extraordinary ability and bravery. Who better to recognize? Who
else do they have around? I'm sure they'll trot out Gerry Ford, but
how far can they go with that?''

<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Woody Williams came within one out of his
second career shutout and Phil Nevin hit a two-run homer to lift
the San Diego Padres past the Philadelphia Phillies 4-1 Monday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Williams (6-3), making his fifth start since coming off the
disabled list with an aneurysm under his right armpit, allowed four
hits and lost the shutout when Pat Burrell homered with two outs in
the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Williams struck out four and walked two to improve to 3-1 in his
last four starts.
</P>
<P>
   Nevin, who hit a game-winning ninth-inning homer Sunday against
Pittsburgh, gave Williams all the support he would need with a
two-run homer in the sixth off Bruce Chen (5-1).
</P>
<P>
   Chen, acquired three weeks ago in a trade for Andy Ashby, had
retired 12 straight batters before walking Ryan Klesko with two
outs in the sixth. Nevin then homered over the right-field wall,
giving him six RBIs in his last two games.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Owens had an RBI triple in the eighth off Chris Brock,
scoring Williams, and then scored on Ruben Rivera's single to make
it 4-0.
</P>
<P>
   Chen allowed two runs and four hits with five strikeouts and two
walks in seven innings. He is 1-1 with a 3.15 ERA in four starts
since the trade.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres' Rivera struck out in his first three at-bats, giving
him 34 strikeouts in his last 25 games.
</P>
<P>
   Williams flew out to center fielder Doug Glanville with runners
on second and third to end the second. Coming into the game,
Williams had gone 7-for-10 since returning from the disabled list
on July 2.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Williams' only career shutout came June 25, 1998, at
Montreal. He has three career complete games. ... The Phillies
obtained RHP John Sneed from Toronto to complete Wednesday's trade
that sent Rob Ducey to the Blue Jays. ... None of the three major
leaguers acquired by the Padres on Monday -- RHPs Jay Witasick,
Heathcliff Slocumb and 1B-OF John Mabry -- arrived in time for the
start of the game. ... Joe Vitiello started in left field in the
Padres' makeshift lineup. ... Monday's game was the 5,000th
regular-season contest in San Diego history. The Padres played
their first game on April 8, 1969.

<HEADLINE> Huggins Turns Down Clippers Job  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI (AP) -- Bob Huggins turned down an offer to coach the
Los Angeles Clippers on Monday night, preferring to stay at the
University of Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins' decision left the NBA's worst team still in search of a
coach. Huggins turned down a four-year contract believed to be
worth a total of $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''We received a call from coach Huggins Monday evening notifying
us of his latest position,'' said Joe Safety, the Clippers' vice
president of communications. ''We wish him well.''
</P>
<P>
   Huggins was tempted by the chance to coach in the NBA, but
decided against taking over one of its least successful teams.
</P>
<P>
   ''To have the opportunity to be a head coach in the NBA and to
coach the greatest basketball players in the world is without a
doubt a goal of mine,'' Huggins said in a statement. ''I'm hoping
someday I will have the opportunity again. But for now, I have made
commitments to players, families and the community that I would
like to see through.''
</P>
<P>
   Huggins met with the Clippers and got their offer on Friday. He
was in Michigan recruiting when he informed the team and the
university of his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ''I still have the burning desire to make a run at the national
championship and there's no better place for me to do it than
here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   During his 11 seasons at Cincinnati, Huggins has taken the
Bearcats to one Final Four and made them a consistent Top 25 team.
The school gave him a $54,000 raise last spring, keeping his
contract among the most lucrative in Conference USA.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers were 15-67 last season, the NBA's worst record, but
improved their roster on draft day with a series of moves.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins has had an interest in coaching in the NBA for some
time.
</P>
<P>
   He withdrew as a candidate for the Miami Heat's head coaching
job in June 1995. Miami was interested in hiring Huggins, then
halted negotiations when Pat Riley resigned from the New York
Knicks. Huggins signed a 10-year extension at Cincinnati, and the
Heat hired Riley.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins has been mentioned in connection with several NBA
vacancies the last few months. He denied a report this month that
Clippers owner Donald Sterling had discussed the job with him.
</P>
<P>
   Huggins' best team provided one of his biggest disappointments
last season. A team ranked No. 1 most of the season came apart
after center Kenyon Martin -- the top pick in June's NBA draft --
broke his leg in the Conference USA tournament. The Bearcats then
lost in the second round of the NCAA tournament for the fourth
consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati enters the upcoming season without five of its top
players from last year's team -- Martin, forwards Pete Mickeal, Ryan
Fletcher and Jermaine Tate and guard DerMarr Johnson.

<HEADLINE> Athletics 6, Blue Jays 1  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE M. PETERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- David Wells lost on the road for the
first time this season as Tim Hudson pitched the Oakland Athletics
over the Toronto Blue Jays 6-1 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Wells (16-4), who leads the majors in victories, had been 10-0
on the road this year. Overall, he had won 13 in a row away from
SkyDome since Sept. 7, 1999, when he lost at Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Miguel Tejada and Adam Piatt homered as Oakland won its third
straight game. Jason Giambi put the A's ahead to stay with an RBI
double in the fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson (12-3) went eight innings, allowing one run on just three
hits. He walked walked one and struck out five.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson has won 11 of his last 12 decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Wells pitched eight innings, giving up five earned runs and 12
hits. He walked two, and has walked only 24 this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays have won 19 of Wells' 22 starts this year. Their
last loss with Wells on the mound was July 15 against Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Mecir, acquired by the A's from Tampa Bay on Friday, made
his first appearance for Oakland and pitched a scoreless ninth.
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied at 1 in the fifth, Wells walked Ryan
Christenson walked with one out. An out later, Giambi's double
sailed to the fence in left-center, scoring Christenson easily.
</P>
<P>
   The A's loaded the bases with one out in the seventh inning
against Wells. But Olmedo Saenz grounded to short and then stumbled
and fell while running to first as the Blue Jays turned a double
play.
</P>
<P>
   Saenz had to be helped off the field with a strained left
hamstring.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the eighth, Ben Grieve singled and Tejada hit
his 24th home run. Terrence Long followed with a double and scored
on Eric Chavez's double. Chavez later scored on Christenson's
suicide squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Fullmer hit a solo home run off Hudson in the second. It
was 22nd homer.
</P>
<P>
   The A's tied it at the bottom of the inning on Piatt's solo
homer off Wells. All four of his home runs this season have come
against left-handed pitchers.
Notes: A's starters have pitched at least seven innings in the
last five games. ... The Athletics traded Triple-A Sacramento
catcher Danny Ardoin to Triple-A Salt Lake for first baseman Mario
Valdez. ... Toronto second baseman Homer Bush was in the original
lineup, but pulled before the game and replaced by Craig Grebeck.
Bush was hit by a pitch on Sunday, and although X-rays were
negative, he was not available to play. ... Right-hander Steve
Traschel, acquired by the Blue Jays in a trade from Tampa Bay, will
join the team in Toronto on Thursday and enter the rotation.

<HEADLINE> Angels 5, Tigers 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Pinch-hitter Scott Spiezio hit a
three-run homer with two outs in the ninth inning, and Tim Salmon
also homered in the ninth as the Anaheim Angels stunned the Detroit
Tigers and closer Todd Jones with a 5-4 victory Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon led off the ninth with his 23rd homer off Jones (0-2),
who blew just his second save in 31 chances. Garret Anderson
walked, and one out later, Ron Gant -- in his first game since being
traded from Philadelphia -- also walked.
</P>
<P>
   With two outs, Spiezio hit a drive that just cleared the 18-foot
high wall in right field. It was his 11th homer and the first by an
Angels' pinch hitter this season.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Petkovsek (4-2) pitched the ninth inning for the win.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Weaver allowed one run and five hits, striking out a
career-high 12 batters in eight innings for Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Gant, traded for pitcher Kent Bottenfield, went 0-for-3 and
struck out with the bases loaded to end the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez hit a solo homer, his 15th, and Juan Encarnacion
hit a two-run homer in the seventh to give Detroit a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers took a 2-1 lead in the fifth when Encarnacion legged
out a double to left-center, making a nice headfirst slide to avoid
the tag of second baseman Benji Gil. Encarnacion moved to third on
a flyout and scored when Salmon's long throw to third deflected
into the dugout for an error.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The walk-off homer was the second for Spiezio who also had
one against Francisco Cordero on May 14 in an 7-6 win against
Texas. ... Weaver became the first Detroit pitcher with
double-digit strikeouts in a game since Justin Thompson did it July
10, 1999, against Milwaukee. ... Detroit's Damion Easley ended a
2-for-19 drought with a fifth-inning double. ... Anaheim's Darin
Erstad needs 23 RBIs in the Angels' final 55 games to become the
first batter in major league history to drive in 100 runs from the
leadoff spot. The closest anyone has come is 98, by Boston's Nomar
Garciaparra in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Lindros Rejects Flyers' Offer  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- After being stripped of his captaincy and
getting ostracized from the team, Eric Lindros had enough of the
Philadelphia Flyers.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros reportedly rejected the team's $8.5 million qualifying
offer Monday, and elected to become a restricted free agent.
</P>
<P>
   CTV Sportsnet and Headline Sports quoted Lindros family lawyer
Gordon Kirke as saying that the center is now a restricted free
agent. Kirke would not provide further details until Tuesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't comment on anything at this point,'' Carl Lindros,
Eric's father and agent, said late Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The qualifying offer included a two-way contract that would
allow the Flyers to send Lindros to their AHL affiliate, the
Philadelphia Phantoms, and pay him a minor league salary of
$85,000.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros, still recovering from his sixth concussion, was
examined recently by Dr. James Kelly, a neurologist in Chicago, and
an independent doctor in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ''They both had similar timelines as far as December, January as
far as coming back playing,'' Lindros said. ''I'm going to continue
with my therapy and be ready when I'm ready. If I was to jump in at
the start of the year, I'd be playing with fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindros has a $20 million insurance policy that covers him this
season. If he doesn't play 20 games, the 27-year-old star center
will receive the full premium tax-free.
</P>
<P>
   After a tumultuous season marked by a feud with general manager
Bob Clarke and four concussions in five months, Lindros appears to
have bid the Flyers farewell.
</P>
<P>
   The Flyers maintained the right to match any offer to Lindros,
and are entitled to compensation if he leaves as a Group 2 free
agent.
</P>
<P>
   When he submitted the qualifying offer, Clarke seemed to reach
out to Lindros, and call for a truce.
</P>
<P>
   ''On a personal level, I greatly regret the extent to which the
relationship between myself and Eric and his family has
deteriorated,'' Clarke said. ''I intend to do whatever I can to try
to move this relationship onto a better course.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks later Clarke urged Lindros to look past their
contentious relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ''It'd be nice if we got along, but it's not necessary in my
opinion,'' Clarke said. ''You're a hockey player, you play for your
coach and your teammates. Lots of players don't like their
managers, but you still play for your teammates and that's what we
encourage him to look at.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindros had 28 goals and 32 assists in 57 games last season,
including four periods of the playoffs. He has made six All-Star
teams and won an MVP award in 1995, but the Flyers lost in their
only Stanley Cup final with him.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros came to Philadelphia in 1992 following a trade with
Quebec that included six players, two first-round draft choices and
$15 million.
</P>
<P>
   Lindros' relationship with Clarke, his childhood hero,
deteriorated to a point last season where the two men didn't speak
for months.
</P>
<P>
   The boiling point came after Lindros criticized the team's
medical staff for failing to diagnose his second concussion of the
season on March 4.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke then stripped Lindros of his captaincy, and the star was
ostracized from the team until he returned for Games 6 and 7 of the
Eastern Conference finals against New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke had an even bigger problem with Lindros' parents. He
accused Carl and Bonnie Lindros of meddling in team matters and
running their son's life.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't want his mom and dad. We've had enough of them,''
Clarke said after the season.
</P>
<P>
   The relationship between the Lindros family and the Flyers
soured further after Lindros suffered a collapsed lung on April 1,
1999, in Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   The potentially life-threatening injury was diagnosed the
following day. After the injury, Lindros and his family had little
confidence in the team's medical staff.

<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Barbra Streisand is sticking to her plan to sing
only two farewell shows in New York - and those shows sold out in
no time.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets to the Sept. 27-28 performances at Madison Square Garden
sold out hours after they went on sale Monday. Tickets ranged from
$125 to $1,500, with VIP tickets going for $2,500, including
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Streisand has said the shows plus two performances in Los
Angeles on Sept. 20-21 will mark the end of her concert career.
</P>
<P>
   ''Garden officials requested two additional concerts in New
York, but she held to her pledge that the pair would be her final
public performances,'' said the singer's publicist, Ken Sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Streisand's live performances have been infrequent. Prior to a
pair of 1993-94 New Year's concerts in Las Vegas, she had not
performed before a paying audience in nearly three decades except
for a single night in Las Vegas to mark the arrival of the
millennium.

<HEADLINE> Indians Plan Tribal Takeover  </HEADLINE>
By BRIAN MELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   TABLE MOUNTAIN RANCHERIA, Calif. (AP) -- Joe Casillas and his
siblings want to go home to the Indian reservation they left 32
years ago. Home to their people and the plot the family once owned.
</P>
<P>
   That plot is now under a cash-flush casino. And the tribal
leaders of Table Mountain Rancheria want nothing to do with the
Casillas or the 115 other disenfranchised members seeking to
recapture their heritage and share in the profits.
</P>
<P>
   The feud, brewing quietly for years, could intensify: Former
residents and descendants say they are planning to take over the
tribal headquarters as early as Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is just a dream come true for us to be able to go back,''
said Casillas, 39. ''It's gonna open up a lot of doors.''
</P>
<P>
   The doors were shut in 1983 after a small band of Mono and
Chukchansi Indians still living on the small reservation regained
federal recognition. They set up a constitution recognizing those
who had been living continuously on the rancheria nestled in the
Sierra foothills about 20 miles northeast of Fresno.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of many carved out in the early 1900s for homeless
Indians. But after losing federal recognition in the 1950s, many
members deserted the parched land to find work.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't move off to move off, we just moved off to work. We
had to eat,'' said Larry Lewis, whose father was a tribal chairman
before the family moved away to become loggers.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, 57, living on disability pay in a dilapidated trailer
without a phone or electricity, said he applied to rejoin, but his
efforts have been met with silence.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal lawyers have said none of the disenfranchised group took
advantage of an open enrollment period in 1981. The Bureau of
Indian Affairs rarely intervenes in these matters, and says tribal
councils can decide who is a member.
</P>
<P>
   Rancheria officials are not commenting and tribal leaders have
refused numerous interview requests.
</P>
<P>
   The Coalition of the Original Descendants of Table Mountain
Rancheria was formed three years ago. On July 18, the group of
about 120 -- twice the size of the voting membership recognized on
the rancheria -- voted to oust all five tribal councilors.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear how much is at stake financially. Coalition members
say voting members get $14,000 a month. Tribal finances are not

<HEADLINE> Homeless March Hits GOP Convention  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER BROWN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Three days of protests coinciding with the
GOP convention have remained peaceful with just a few arrests, and
police credit their decision to communicate with demonstrators.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're not going to do anything they want. But there's a lot
of room in there for talking,'' said police Commissioner John
Timoney.
</P>
<P>
   Police caution the week is not over, but the early success is
unmistakable:
</P>
<P>
   --Police negotiated a peaceful end to Monday's illegal homeless
march of 3,000 people, which for months organizers had said would
include as many as 100 arrests and ''large-scale civil
disobedience.''
</P>
<P>
   --About 75 anti-death penalty activists walked away after a brief
confrontation with police about whether they could block traffic
downtown Sunday. More than 500 uniformed officers assembled, and
the standoff dissolved after 40 minutes of discussion.
</P>
<P>
   --Police arranged for a workers' rights group to hold a 15-minute
rally inside the atrium shopping area of Lord &AMP; Taylor's department
store Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   --On Sunday, police closed an entrance to the Benjamin Franklin
Bridge to New Jersey so that 200 people could rally against police
brutality.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have various levels of tolerance. We're not going to let
anyone get hurt, we're not going to put up with any violence or
serious property damage. Absent that, we're willing to make a
deal,'' Timoney said.
</P>
<P>
   Recent international meetings in Seattle and Washington, D.C.,
led to massive arrests and, particularly in Seattle, millions in
property damage. At April's World Bank meeting in Washington,
police arrested more than 1,200 people.
</P>
<P>
   In Philadelphia, 17 people have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
   ''I really think it's testimony to good judgment on the part of
the police commissioner and the mayor,'' said attorney Jonathan
Blazer, legal counsel for the homeless-rights group Kensington
Welfare Right Union.
</P>
<P>
   Homeless-rights organizer Cheri Honkala had been planning
Monday's homeless march for months and vowed that she would march
to the ''door of the Republican National Convention.''
</P>
<P>
   But after a 4-mile march to within a half-mile of the convention
site and negotiations with police, Honkala said they was close
enough to be heard.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got to do what we set out to do which was walk right up to
the convention center,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Timoney remained ''cautiously optimistic'' about the rest of the
week.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not naive; I see what I see. There are some folks clearly
looking for the trouble,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon: Recruitment Is Climbing  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Thanks partly to its snappy new Internet
sites, the Pentagon is reaching more potential recruits -- and
expects to meet its enlistment goals this year.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since 1997, all four services are expected to
meet their enlistment goals, officials said Monday, crediting new
recruiting methods and a host of job incentives.
</P>
<P>
   Incentives offered in the last couple of years -- to draw new
recruits or keep those in the service from leaving -- include better
pay, more enlistment bonuses, shorter service time and computers in
the barracks for those who want to get an online education while
they serve in the military.
</P>
<P>
   The services also have added recruiters and are using the
Internet more aggressively.
</P>
<P>
   ''The majority of our leads are coming off of the Web page,''
said Air Force recruiting spokesman Master Sgt. Tom Clements.
''It's our most productive method of getting leads'' for recruiters
to pursue.
</P>
<P>
   Army officials say that since they redesigned their Web site,
they've corresponded with more than 30,000 chat room users,
generating more than 7,000 follow-up e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have said the slump in recruiting in recent years is
due partly to higher-paying civilian jobs in the strong U.S.
economy, a higher rate of people going to college and the fact that
fewer young people nowadays know anyone in uniform or think of the
military as a possible career.
</P>
<P>
   The Marines regularly meet their sign-up goals, the Army, Air
Force and Navy have not always been as successful.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy made its goal last year, but in 1998 fell 7,000 short
of the 55,000 recruits it was looking for. The Army failed to get
enough people in the last two years and the Air Force last year
missed its goal for the first time in 20 years as pilots turned
their backs on the military for jobs with commercial airlines.
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, the Air Force signed up the 34,000 recruits
it was looking for by July 18, with two months left in the fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're happy, but ... not celebrating,'' said Air Force
recruiting spokesman Master Sgt. Tom Clements, predicting the
Pentagon will continue to face an uphill battle in coming years.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force believes its improved recruiting is due in to
increased and more strategically placed television advertising, an
increase in the number of recruiters, and the ''attractive,
revamped Web page,'' Clements said.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force also has been offering as incentives shorter
enlistment periods for some jobs and more bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   The Army says it expects to sign up 12,000 more people than last
year. In 1999, it recruited about 68,000, well short of the 74,000
goal. So far this year it has signed 76,000 and expects to meet the
goal of 80,000 before the year ending Sept. 31, said Army director
of recruiting Col. Kevin T. Kelley.
</P>
<P>
   The Army focused on recruitment ''from top leadership down,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   New Army incentives included a program in which several
corporations have pledged to give preferential hiring treatment to
those who've completed their service. Another allows the enlistee
to attend two years of college before joining the Army, giving a
monthly stipend during those studies.
</P>
<P>
   Kelley said officials are ''very optimistic and positive'' about
the results they've gotten so far. ''What we cannot do is ...
relax,'' he said. ''We have to keep on going because it's still a
very competitive market place.''

<HEADLINE> Verizon Unions Negotiate Jobs  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- More than 85,000 employees of Verizon
Communications are negotiating for a bigger share of the telephone
giant's growing wireless operation.
</P>
<P>
   The Communications Workers of America and International
Brotherhood of Electrical Workers unions, armed with authority to
call a strike, headed for a second day of talks Tuesday with
Verizon, which was created by the June merger of Bell Atlantic and
GTE. The union's contract with Verizon expires this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, neither side would characterize the talks, nor even
pinpoint where they are being held in Washington. The unions and
the company agreed the going could be tough.
</P>
<P>
   ''I expect they will grow more intense,'' CWA spokeswoman
Candace Johnson said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, CWA struck Bell Atlantic and IBEW honored the picket
lines, affecting service in 13 Eastern states and the District of
Columbia. A 1989 strike by both unions against Nynex, which later
merged with Bell Atlantic, lasted four months.
</P>
<P>
   The authority to strike this time came during regional talks in
New York and Philadelphia last week. An impasse at 12:01 a.m.
Sunday could send operators and technicians to the picket lines and
leave 25 million homes and businesses from Maine to Virginia
without help setting up phone services, repairing or installing
lines, and figuring out their telephone bills.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders say they are seeking better benefits, wages and
working conditions and concessions to create more union-represented
jobs in the wireless division.
</P>
<P>
   A fraction of workers in the Verizon wireless division are
unionized, while most of the company's local phone operation
workers are union members. Armed with data on wages and employee
productivity, the sides are at odds over what kind of access the
unions should have to wireless jobs, among the fastest-growing
sectors in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our members have made Verizon a success,'' Johnson said. Union
officials say Verizon's wireless operation uses new job categories,
profit-sharing options and temporary workers to shut out the
unions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The union right now is free to conduct an organizing campaign,
if it so wishes,'' because the wireless division is a separate
company responsible for its own labor relations, said Verizon
spokesman Steven Marcus.
</P>
<P>
   The company's traditional ''wire-line'' operations just happen
to have a strong union tradition, he said. In wireless services,
''for the most part there is no tradition of union
representation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that Verizon Wireless already has a small bargaining
unit.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said those roughly 50 jobs -- out of 32,000 in the
company -- were grandfathered in from Bell Atlantic's merger with
Nynex mobile communications company. Wire-line workers would lose
their union benefits if they were to seek wireless jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The Communications Workers of America, bargaining separately
from the electrical workers, adds excessive stress and forced
overtime as major issues. Workers at call centers, who market
products to and solve problems for phone customers, are not given
proper training, and employees are forced to work overtime, cancel
vacations and stay on shifts despite family emergencies, the union
says.
</P>
<P>
   Marcus said the company has increased union wire-line jobs in
the last year.

<HEADLINE> Cheney Joins Hastert in Quest  </HEADLINE>
By JEANNINE AVERSA
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Dick Cheney is teaming up with House Speaker
Dennis Hastert to not only help Republicans capture the White House
but also to keep them in control of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney -- George W. Bush's vice presidential ticket mate and a
five-term member of the House -- is kicking off Day Two of the
Republican National Convention Tuesday by taking part in a luncheon
for the Illinois lawmaker.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's appearance ''serves to energize our troops,'' said John
McGovern, a spokesman for Hastert, whose entered Congress while
Cheney was there representing Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dick Cheney is a veteran of the House and appreciates the
importance of keeping a majority,'' McGovern said. Cheney's support
''reinforces the partnership we are building between the
presidential campaign and the congressional campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Hastert, meanwhile, said he wasn't ruffled by the relative
absence of congressional candidates as speakers in the convention
lineup. ''We're doing this district by district-- the old-fashioned
way,'' Hastert said. ''We have the best candidates. They're going
to have the money to get their message out.''
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, Cheney will spend time on the convention floor
rehearsing his speech, which will be delivered Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Aides say he has completed the text but continues to tinker with
certain passages. They wouldn't reveal the themes Cheney will
discuss.
</P>
<P>
   Speech writing experts said Cheney may face some challenges as
he steps back into public life after being in the private sector
for the last five years as a globe-trotting executive at
Halliburton Co., a giant oil-service firm.
</P>
<P>
   Giving a corporate speech and a political speech are ''hugely
different,'' said Robert Orben, a speech writer for President Ford.
</P>
<P>
   ''The essence of a business speaker is to be a serious person,''
Orben said. ''One of the things you learn in the world of
international business, is that you better go easy on jokes, humor
doesn't always translate. But in politics humor is a real asset''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Cheney -- calm, collected, even appearing a bit
distant at times -- quietly worked the opening day of the convention
as Democrats launched a new line of attack on his record.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, they went after his student and then fatherhood
draft deferments during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, a Vietnam veteran and
sometimes-mentioned possible running mate for Al Gore, said Cheney
''had other priorities in the '60s. So did a lot of other young men
who went over there and didn't come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush campaign spokesman Ari Fleischer said Democrats ''have
fallen into a full panic about this Republican ticket,'' and
questioned why Harkin hasn't criticized President Clinton, who also
avoided the draft.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's interesting that Harkin would discuss his feelings about
Cheney and never say a word about Clinton,'' Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   At the convention, Cheney, often accompanied by his wife, Lynne,
was welcomed with rousing applause and chants.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're so proud of you,'' one supporter yelled to Cheney Monday
evening as he listened to speeches by Bush's wife, Laura, and
retired Gen. Colin Powell. Cheney, in an uncharacteristic move,
responded by giving a thumbs up and flashing a wide smile.
</P>
<P>
   ''He will be a superb vice president,'' Powell said of his
former colleague during the speech. Powell was chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff while Cheney was secretary of Defense during
the administration of Bush's father.
</P>
<P>
   The hoopla was a far cry from Cheney's days as a private
citizen.
</P>
<P>
   In his trademark low-key style, Cheney described his transition
into the whirlwind Republican campaign as little more than a
''change of pace.''

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's President Meets Rivals  </HEADLINE>
By DANIEL COONEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   YOGYAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- Indonesia's embattled president met
his main political rivals in this ancient city Tuesday, hoping to
ease tensions imperiling his grip on power along with the nation's
fragile economy and fledgling democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting is hosted by the city's revered sultan behind the
whitewashed walls of his sprawling palace. It comes six days before
President Abdurrahman Wahid faces pressure at an annual meeting of
the People's Consultative Assembly, Indonesia's highest legislative
body.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid's, whose patchy record and unpredictable style has
infuriated lawmakers, met with assembly chairman Amien Rais,
parliamentary Speaker Akbar Tandjung and Vice President Megawati
Sukarnoputri.
</P>
<P>
   Infighting among the four, who head different political parties,
has led to fears of a deepening rift within Wahid's coalition
government, formed 10 months ago after decades of authoritarian
rule.
</P>
<P>
   Sultan Hamengku Buwono X invited the group for reconciliation
talks after a similar meeting was canceled last month when Megawati
failed to attend. Her party was angered by Wahid's decision to fire
one of its top officials from the Cabinet and his refusal to tell
the parliament why.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid and Megawati made no comment when they arrived at the
palace.
</P>
<P>
   ''The controversy in the political situation is quite high,''
said Tandjung, who heads the Golkar Party. ''We want the
controversy to become low.''
</P>
<P>
   Rais also hoped progress could be made.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid has been increasingly criticized for his inability to end
a long-running separatist war in the country's west and an ongoing
bloody religious conflict in the east, and failure to fix the
ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
   Disgruntled senior lawmakers have promised not to launch
impeachment proceedings during the assembly, but said Wahid should
be removed if his performance does not improve soon.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's currency, the rupiah, hit a 21-month low earlier
this month, on fears of greater political instability and a
possible outbreak of violence during the assembly's session.

<HEADLINE> William Maxwell, revered New Yorker editor and writer, dies at 91  </HEADLINE>
By HILLEL ITALIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - William Maxwell, the revered editor of such New
Yorker writers as J.D. Salinger and John Cheever and himself an
accomplished man of letters, died at his home Monday. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Hired in 1937 by The New Yorker's Katharine White, a founding
editor and the wife of E.B. White, Maxwell was on staff for 40
years and worked with some of the magazine's most celebrated
authors, including Salinger, Cheever, John O'Hara, John Updike and
Harold Brodkey.
</P>
<P>
   In ''About Town,'' a history of The New Yorker published this
year, author Ben Yagoda noted that Maxwell's correspondence with
writers ''exudes a palpable empathy.'' For many, Maxwell was the
ideal editor, a man of civilized temperament and compassionate
rigor.
</P>
<P>
   Cheever, with whom he had an especially close, intense
relationship, once praised him for ''the advice he gave me and the
advice he didn't give me.'' Cheever and Brodkey were among those
who dedicated books to Maxwell.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a writer I don't very much enjoy being edited. As an editor
I tried to work so slightly on the manuscript that 10 years later
the writer would read his story and not be aware that anybody was
involved but him,'' Maxwell once commented. ''This involves
listening and watching the writer's face for signs of
dissatisfaction. Again, it is a simple matter of love.''
</P>
<P>
   In person, the slightly built Maxwell was the very image of the
vintage New Yorker staffer: learned, but self-effacing; gracious,
but not effusive; dignified, but not stuffy - the kind of man who
would laugh out loud at a Marx Brothers movie.
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell's career as an author preceded his time at The New
Yorker. His first novel, ''Bright Center of Heaven,'' was published
in 1934. Subsequent books included the story collections ''Billie
Dyer'' and ''Over by the River,'' and the 1980 novel, ''So Long,
See You Tomorrow,'' which won the American Book Award.
</P>
<P>
   His works demonstrated what a sensitive man could do with a
seemingly limited number of experiences. Maxwell's life hardly
ranked with Hemingway's for manly adventure, but in his mind he
endured conflicts as challenging as any bullfight.
</P>
<P>
   The author was born Aug. 16, 1908, and lived his early years in
Lincoln, Ill., a quiet town complete with tree-shaded streets and a
courthouse square.
</P>
<P>
   This world seemed incapable of changing, but it did, with little
warning. When Maxwell was 10, his mother became sick with the flu
and died. His father remarried, sold the house and moved the family
to Chicago. Again and again, the author relived those events in his
books.
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell's was the fiction of disruption. The seemingly peaceful
settings - a Midwestern town, Manhattan's Upper East Side, the
French countryside - are haunted by death, betrayal, a child's
dreams. Even a damaged bicycle becomes a symbol for lost innocence,
something that can never ''be made shining and whole again.''
</P>
<P>
   He was the purest of writers, and remained so in interviews.
Like Vladimir Nabokov, Maxwell preferred giving his answers in
writing, tapping them out on an old electric typewriter, pausing to
allow the reporter to read his response and patiently waiting for
the next question.
</P>
<P>
   In 1945, Maxwell married Emily Gilman Noyes, who died July 23.
They had two daughters, Katharine and Emily.

<HEADLINE> Bush Name Is Put Into Nomination  </HEADLINE>
By TERENCE HUNT
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Mixing politics and patriotism, Republicans
turned to a trio of wartime heroes to offer convention testimonials
for Texas Gov. George W. Bush -- untested on the world stage -- and
energize voters with a call to keep America the strongest country
in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Former Bush challenger John McCain, one-time GOP presidential
nominee Bob Dole and retired Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, commander of
the war against Iraq, stepped forward for the second night of the
Republican's convention gala. McCain came with a message of unity
and reconciliation, saying in a prepared speech ''it is my time to
serve'' his former rival.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates wildly cheered another veteran, retired Gen. Colin
Powell, as he praised Bush on Monday night for bridging racial
divides and improving schools in Texas. But Powell also took
Republicans to task for missing no opportunity to ''roundly and
loudly condemn affirmative action.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell said the GOP must reach out to minorities -- ''and not
just during an election-year campaign. My friends, if we're serious
about this, it must be a sustained effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, slowly making his way to Philadelphia on a bus trip
through five states, tantalized the convention with a brief speech,
beamed to the convention hall by satellite from Westerville, Ohio.
Ahead in the polls, Bush said he was ''traveling through states
that Democrats won in the last few elections. But not this time.
Not this year.'' He will lay claim to the nomination Thursday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also hinted that Powell, the only black to serve as
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, would get a job in his
administration. Powell is a leading candidate to be Bush's
secretary of state. ''I hope his greatest service to America might
still lie ahead,'' the governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats tried to deflate the impact of Powell's address and
steal attention from the convention. Civil rights leader Jesse
Jackson said there was a ''tremendous gap between the personal
virtues and values of Colin Powell and the policies of the
Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said the delegates ''would not dare embarrass'' Powell
but that neither George W. Bush nor his brother Florida Gov. Jeb
Bush would support affirmative action in their states. Democrats
also were unveiling another television ad critical of Bush. The new
spot, on health care, is part of a $3.5 million, 17-state one-week
blitz.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's wife, Laura, a former librarian and the mother of their
twin girls, also took a star turn on opening night, admitting that
she was a little overwhelmed with her prime-time speech. But she
went on to praise her husband as a consensus builder between
Republicans and Democrats who ''shares credit and he doesn't cast
blame.
</P>
<P>
   ''He sets a tone that's positive and constructive, a tone that's
very different from the bitterness and the division that too often
characterized Washington D.C.,'' Texas' first lady said.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates gushed about her address. ''It seemed like it came
from the heart,'' said Diane Adams, Republican national
committeewoman from Indiana. ''And when you talk about somebody you
love, it's easy for it to come from the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's parents, former President Bush and his wife Barbara,
beamed smiles from their VIP seats. Bush running mate Dick Cheney
also was on hand to cheer and got a salute from Powell, who served
under Cheney when he was secretary of defense.
</P>
<P>
   Former Presidents Bush and Ford take the spotlight Tuesday night
in a convention tribute to former Republican presidents. Nancy
Reagan was flying in from California to stand in for her husband,
suffering from Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, Bush's most vigorous primary challenger, came to the
convention with a unity speech. A draft of his remarks linked
McCain's grandfather, a World War II admiral, with former President
Bush, a World War II Navy pilot.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many years ago, the governor's father fought for our country,
with distinction, under the command of my grandfather,'' McCain
says. ''Now it is my turn to serve under the son of my
grandfather's subordinate.'' McCain himself is a war hero, who
withstood 5&AMP;frac12; years of captivity during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's words were far different from those he used in the heat
of the primary campaign when he accused Bush of taking the ''low
road'' and pandering to anti-Catholic and religious right
sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's prepared remarks called for ''government reform'' in
general, but made no direct mention of his bid to overhaul election
finance laws -- the issue that divides McCain from Bush and other
GOP leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Republican strategists say Bush has to use the convention to
persuade Americans that he can lead the whole country, not just the
state of Texas, and has what it takes to deal with international
problems. That's where testimonials from respected veterans such as
Dole, who was gravely wounded in World War II, and Schwarzkopf,
could help.
</P>
<P>
   Powell drew perhaps his biggest applause when he said Bush would
follow the example set by Presidents Reagan and Bush in making sure
the nation remained strong militarily.
</P>
<P>
   Hewing to the carefully calculated script of moderation and
tolerance, the speakers' lineup on the second night of the
convention also included Rep. Jim Kolbe of Arizona, the only openly
gay Republican in Congress, Condoleezza Rice, the black woman who
is Bush's chief foreign policy adviser, and Elizabeth Dole, the
former Cabinet member who briefly ran for the GOP nomination
herself.

<HEADLINE> Peru President's Grip on Power Firm  </HEADLINE>
By RICK VECCHIO
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Despite deadly protests against his
inauguration and international pressure for democratic reform,
President Alberto Fujimori's authoritarian hold on power appears as
firm as ever.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, the State Department expressed disappointment
Monday that Fujimori did not outline more detailed democratic
reforms during his inaugural speech three days earlier.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. officials gave no indication that sanctions were any
more likely against the 62-year-old leader than before his
swearing-in Friday, which was marred by protesters torching several
government buildings, including the state-run Banco de la Nacion,
killing six bank employees.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrators were protesting Fujimori's severely questioned May
28 re-election to an unprecedented third five-year term, which was
boycotted by his presidential opponent, Alejandro Toledo. Monitors
from the Organization of American States deemed the ballot far from
''free or fair'' and refused to observe the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Congress withheld $42 million in emergency
anti-narcotics and development aid from Peru in late June, sending
an apparent signal to Fujimori to improve his democratic
credentials.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clinton administration has since backed away from an
initially tough position, fearing that pushing Fujimori's
government toward international isolation could undermine the
regional war on drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd be surprised if there were a strong internationally
brokered and organized stance that was really able to solicit
anything more than marginal changes of behavior by Fujimori,'' said
Carol Graham, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say Peru's opposition played into Fujimori's hands with
its failure to prevent the worst anti-government violence seen here
since the early 1990s, when Fujimori's government turned the tables
on the deadly Maoist Shining Path insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   ''It creates a favorable situation for Fujimori to reopen the
themes of violence and terrorism and present himself once again as
a symbol of stability,'' said Giovanna Penaflor, head of the
private polling firm Imasen.
</P>
<P>
   The violence overshadowed a peaceful protest against Fujimori's
regime the night before, which drew at least 80,000 people in what
many said was the largest mass rally in modern Peruvian history.
</P>
<P>
   The violence also prompted a rare public appearance by feared
security adviser Vladimiro Montesinos.
</P>
<P>
   Montesinos sat impassively with top police and military
commanders Saturday while the president defiantly labeled his foes
as ''solely capable of guaranteeing chaos and violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori pledged he would not weaken the National Intelligence
Service, controlled by Montesinos. The president's opponents accuse
the shadowy spy chief of using illegal surveillance, blackmail and
infiltration to maintain Fujimori's control over all branches of
government.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori promised a high-level OAS delegation in June that he
would work with the opposition to reform the military and
intelligence service, create an independent judiciary and promote
freedom of expression and of the press.
</P>
<P>
   ''But what we've seen until now is a government absolutely
impervious to any type of negotiation, dialogue or concession,''
political scientist Fernando Rospigliosi said.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori failed to regain a clear congressional majority in the
April 9 general elections. But he managed to achieve legislative
control anyway after a wave of last-minute defections from
opposition ranks in the final days before his swearing-in.
</P>
<P>
   His foes charge that he used bribes, threats and intimidation to
persuade opposition lawmakers to jump ship and give his alliance a
majority. He has denied the allegations.

<HEADLINE> Washington Debates Aid to Colombia  </HEADLINE>
By KEN GUGGENHEIM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two deadly guerrilla attacks on Colombian
police have raised delicate questions after the recent approval of
a $1.3 billion anti-narcotics aid package.
</P>
<P>
   Can U.S.-provided anti-drug helicopters be used for missions
that aren't directly related to drugs? If so, could that push the
United States deeper into Colombia's protracted civil war?
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend, the helicopters -- provided under an earlier
counternarcotics package -- were used to carry security forces to
Arboleda, a mountain town 90 miles northwest of Bogota, where as
many as 22 policemen may have been killed.
</P>
<P>
   But two weeks earlier, the helicopters sat idle as 13 officers
were killed in cold blood in the southwestern town of Roncesvalles.
The officers were shot one-by-one after they ran out of ammunition
and tried to surrender, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The Roncesvalles killings prompted Rep. Benjamin Gilman, R-N.Y.,
chairman of the House International Relations Committee, to write
to Secretary of State Madeleine Albright his misgivings that U.S.
use restrictions might have kept the helicopters from being used.
</P>
<P>
   Both U.S. and Colombian officials denied that was the case.
Colombian National Police Chief Ernesto Gilibert said helicopters
were not deployed because they weren't equipped to fly at night.
</P>
<P>
   An American official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
U.S. policy allows Colombia to use the helicopters ''for
humanitarian purposes to prevent a loss of life and to provide
evacuation.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States regularly reviews helicopter flight records to
make sure helicopter use complies with guidelines, the official
said. To date, Colombia has consistently met those guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is sensitive from two sides. On one side is Gilman,
who supports the Colombian aid and wants to see the United States
help the Colombian National Police as much as it can.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side are opponents of the aid, skeptical that it
can be limited to the drug fight and keep the United States from
getting drawn into Colombia's 36-year-long war against leftist
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.3 billion package signed by President Clinton on July 13
will provide helicopters and other assistance to Colombian army
counternarcotics battalions. Those battalions will fight
guerrillas, who finance their insurgency by protecting drug
producers.
</P>
<P>
   The package also shifts the focus of U.S. aid from the police,
whose main task is fighting drugs, to the army, whose main task is
fighting guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have insisted they will not cross the line
between fighting drug trafficking and fighting the rebels.
Opponents say that's a tough distinction to make.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., said the concerns raised by Gilman
''speak to the whole problem that there's very little clarity about
rules of combat.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's very unclear what's counternarcotics and what's
counterinsurgency. We're going to have over and over and over again
many examples like this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The attack in Roncesvalles did not appear to be tied to a
counternarcotics operation. The officers spent 27 hours fighting
off an attack by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia,
according to police. When they ran out of ammunition, they tried to
surrender. Each officer was shot point-blank in the head.
</P>
<P>
   John Mackey, an aide to Gilman, said Colombian police officials
told him they were reluctant to use the Black Hawk helicopters
because they thought they were restricted to counternarcotics
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The National Police chief insisted there was no question they
could have been used.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we need to use them for humanitarian purposes, we're not
going to hesitate in doing so. What's more, we've already done
so,'' Gilibert told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   He said U.S. rules are clear about when the helicopters, flown
by Colombian pilots, can be used.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going to use them to attack a guerrilla group, but,
yes, we can use them to defend ourselves,'' Gilibert said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. State Department spokesman Philip Reeker said Monday the
helicopters used in Arboleda were ''in the right location'' with
the forces that were going to try to rescue the police.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.S.-supplied aircraft are generally permitted to conduct
such rescue flights and search-and-rescue missions in addition to
their normal counternarcotics responsibilities,'' he said. ''So
that was very much in keeping with the standard practice.''

<HEADLINE> Gays Welcome at GOP Convention  </HEADLINE>
By BART JANSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Brian Bennett, a conservative Catholic who
also is gay, hopes George W. Bush is the leader who will move the
Republican Party away from the past on the issue of gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, one of about a dozen gay Republicans who met with Bush
in April, said the candidate seemed interested in issues facing
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I came out of the meeting feeling like we should be part of
this party,'' said Bennett, a convention delegate from California.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has made inclusion a key theme of his campaign. For gays,
that has meant a larger -- albeit still small -- role at the
convention.
</P>
<P>
   This year, 18 delegates and alternates are openly gay, compared
to five in 1996, according to Kevin Ivers, spokesman for the
national gay group Log Cabin Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   An openly gay congressman, Rep. Jim Kolbe of Arizona, was to
speak to the convention Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once that happens and the sky doesn't fall, it'll happen again
in the future,'' said Jeff Bissiri, an alternate delegate who is
president of Log Cabin's Los Angeles chapter.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the GOP platform says homosexuality is incompatible with
military service, offers no special legal protection based on
sexual preference and opposes recognition of gay marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, chief of staff to former GOP Rep. Robert Dornan, says
the party needs to make plenty of progress on gay rights.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe many party officials are aware of it, but they need
a little encouragement from the top. I think George Bush is the man
to give them that encouragement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, the Log Cabin Republicans held a parallel
convention to call for greater tolerance. In 1992, Patrick Buchanan
criticized homosexuals in a speech to the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Stewart, a delegate and mayor of Plattsburgh, N.Y., said he
is pleased by progress in the GOP since then.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the Republican Party is slowly turning itself in a
more moderate direction, speaking to middle America,'' he said.
''This presidential campaign is going to be a close one and George
Bush is going to have to speak to all America.''

<HEADLINE> Crash Citizenship Plan Faulted  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- One of Vice President Gore's attempts to
improve government -- by erasing a massive backlog of citizenship
applications -- produced such confusion that thousands of people
became citizens without adequate background checks, the Justice
Department says.
</P>
<P>
   The rush to naturalize 1.2 million new citizens in fiscal year
1996 ''compromised the integrity'' of the process at the
Immigration and Naturalization Service, according to a report
released Monday by the Justice Department's inspector general.
</P>
<P>
   The report said there is no evidence that the 1996 presidential
election motivated the crash program, but at least one official in
Gore's government-reinvention office told investigators he felt
pressure to have the backlog erased in time for the new citizens to
vote in November.
</P>
<P>
   The 684-page report concluded that there was no evidence to
support critics' claims that the crash ''Citizenship USA'' program,
a part of Gore's government reinvention effort, was designed to
influence the election or ''further inappropriate political ends.''
</P>
<P>
   About 1.2 million people were given citizenship from October
1995 to September 1996 under the program that eliminated a massive
backlog of nearly 500,000 citizenship cases at the Immigration and
Naturalization Service. At the time, the waiting period for
citizenship was as much as three years.
</P>
<P>
   Critics complained that the rush program was aimed at producing
hundreds of thousands of new voters who were likely to vote
Democratic in the 1996 presidential election in November. The
program succeeded in erasing the backlog by Sept. 31, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the White House nor officials at the National
Performance Review Office -- Gore's government-reinvention operation
-- intervened to lower standards or change procedures to get
applicants naturalized in time to vote, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   But the National Performance Review Office was aggressively
involved in pressing for a speedup of applications at INS early in
the program, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   At least one NPR official, Douglas Farbrother, ''believed that
the (citizenship) program had a deadline that was directly
connected to the upcoming election,'' although others at NPR viewed
it as a good government initiative, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1996, Farbrother raised concerns with Deputy Attorney
General Jamie Gorelick and senior INS officials that the program
was lagging behind schedule and made his views known to the extent
that Gorelick threw him out of his office, according to the
investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Farbrother told investigators that he understood that
citizenship applicants had to be naturalized in time to register to
vote in the November 1996 election and that ''this was one motive
for the NPR's involvement'' in the Citizenship USA program,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   But the report concluded that while some may have hoped for
political benefit, ''we did not find evidence that officials of INS
or the (Justice) Department adopted this as a goal.'' After May
1996, the NPR had little involvement in the program, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the investigators found that the crash program -- which
intensified even more after the March meeting in Gorelick's office
-- put quantity over quality and ''compromised the naturalization
process.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation, involving 1,800 interviews and review of
80,000 pages of documents, confirmed media reports at the time that
the INS had processed applicants so quickly that in many cases
citizenship was granted before the INS received criminal background
checks from the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators found at least 1,300 such cases in Chicago, 2,500
in Los Angeles and nearly 1,000 in Miami. There likely were tens of
thousands of cases where applications were approved without
complete background checks, according to the investigators. But the
report said there was no way to determine how many unqualified
individuals might have gained citizenship.

Republicans Open National Convention
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Determined to send George W. Bush to the White House,
Republicans opened their 37th national convention Monday with a meticulously
scripted appeal to voters in the political middle. Colin Powell praised the
Texas governor's ''passion for inclusion,'' and bluntly challenged the GOP to
follow his lead. Bush knows ''that the party of Lincoln has not always carried
the mantle of Lincoln,'' Powell told delegates and a nationwide television
audience. ''He wants the Republican Party to wear that mantle again.''

Homeless March Hits GOP Convention

   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Thousands of homeless activists caused traffic headaches
but few other problems Monday as a third day of Republican National
Convention-related protests remained peaceful with only 11 arrests. While police
threatened to arrest demonstrators who walked in the streets, officials
acquiesced almost immediately when the group -- led by about 80 children and
some 20 people in wheelchairs -- started marching in the roadway. The impromptu
parade extended 4 miles from City Hall to within a block of the convention site,
ending in a city park. There were no arrests.

Study: Drinking Protects Diabetics

   DALLAS (AP) -- Two new studies support the idea that diabetics who make
moderate drinking a routine are less likely to suffer from heart disease,
despite fears it can throw off their blood-sugar balance. Researchers have
already shown that having an occasional drink with dinner is good for the
general population; it cuts the risk of heart disease and stroke by as much as
20 percent. In both new studies researchers found that diabetics who consumed
more than half a drink per day cut their heart disease risk in half compared
with those who rarely drank or never consumed alcohol at all.

<HEADLINE> Change Seen in GOP Rhetoric  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Ray Dearin has noticed a change in how
Republicans talk.
</P>
<P>
   ''The vocabulary's different. We're hearing a lot more terms of
empathic understanding, of people and their feelings,'' said
Dearin, an Iowa delegate who happens to be a communications
professor at Iowa State University. ''We're hearing less hard-edged
rhetoric.''
</P>
<P>
   Dearin, 58, should know. He's been involved in the last six GOP
conventions and was a delegate in 1980, 1984 and 1996. He has also
studied the acceptance speech of every Republican presidential
nominee since Wendell Wilkie in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   His academic specialty is political rhetoric. His hobby is
politics.
</P>
<P>
   And Dearin said his professional standing with colleagues has
never been threatened by his longtime Republican roots. In 1972 he
was Iowa chairman of Educators for Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think they think of me as a Republican scholar, but as
a scholar who happens to be a Republican,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Fellow Republicans are in awe that a guy named George Wallace is
now on their team. At this week's GOP convention, Wallace Jr. gets
stopped repeatedly to sign an autograph, shake a hand, or spin a
tale about events he barely recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, Wallace is the celebrity Alabama delegate, and
it's not for being such an effective public service commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's father was the longtime Democratic governor remembered
for demanding segregation in the 1960s, although he later preached
inclusion in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Wallace wants to make one thing clear: His family
didn't change its political views. The political parties changed
theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel very comfortable here,'' Wallace said of the party.
''This is where I belong, but I do realize the strength of the name
has got me quite a bit more attention.''
</P>

   It's been a difficult year for rancher Marie Ingalls. Her son
was shot and killed last summer at age 42 by his stepson, and
Ingalls recently underwent treatment at the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, Minn., for a brain tumor.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the former state legislator from Mud Butte, S.D., is
determined to live life as fully as she can. She recently took a
European vacation with her husband and this week she is fulfilling
a lifelong dream of attending a national convention as a delegate.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's something I always wanted to do,'' Ingalls said. ''It's
exciting for us to be here. I got kind of choked up on the floor
this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I think she is just a testament to South Dakota toughness and
resiliency,'' said state Rep. Bill Peterson of Sioux Falls.

   Mormon members of Utah's contingent at the GOP convention are
used to spending Monday nights in faith-promoting ''Family Home
Evenings.''
</P>
<P>
   This week, instead, they talked about national politics and
listened to Laura Bush and Gen. Colin Powell extoll the virtues of
education and diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional candidate Derek Smith and his wife, Genine, left
their three children with grandparents in Utah. ''We're getting a
little bit of time together,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Several delegates and alternates brought their children along to
share the experience. Tom and Nathan Draschil, father and son from
Provo, are both delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Family Home Evening is encouraged by Mormon leaders as a way to
ensure that parents and children spend time together at least one
night a week. It can focus on religious study and reflection or
secular fun.

<HEADLINE> McCain Gets Chance To Mend Fences  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- This time around, John McCain says, speaking
to the Republican convention won't be particularly prestigious.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's something that's usually accorded to losers,'' McCain
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator spent several hours Monday preparing for
Tuesday night's address, which he said will focus on his support
for primary rival George W. Bush and the greatness and promise he
sees in America's future.
</P>
<P>
   For McCain personally, the speech offers a chance to mend fences
with the Republican officials he alienated during a sometimes
bitter campaign against the Texas governor. He also gets a chance
to appear graceful in defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ''The American people,'' McCain said repeatedly this week,
''don't like sore losers.'' But he also got laughs by repeating an
old quote from the late football coach Vince Lombardi: ''Show me a
good loser and I'll show you a loser.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain says this speech is not as nerve-racking as the one he
gave in 1996 nominating Bob Dole for president because this time
only his own reputation is on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile on Monday McCain worked to bring the young and
independent voters who supported his presidential bid into the
Republican fold, making his case on MTV and planning congressional
campaign trips to both coasts.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you want those old geezers to be interested in your
issues,'' get involved, vote in congressional races, he said at an
MTV-sponsored event at the Hard Rock Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   If enough voters ages 18-26 cast ballots this fall, they could
swing the election, McCain said on a stage in front of a
stained-glass portrait of Elvis.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Pharmaceutical To Sue U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE GEDDA
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Sudanese pharmaceutical plant targeted by
U.S. missiles two years ago was engaged in no illicit activities,
its owner said in announcing he will seek $50 million in
compensation from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In ordering the attack against the al-Shifa plant in August
1998, President Clinton alleged that the facility had links to
Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi-born millionaire suspected in the
bombings of U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   Salah Idris, the Sudanese businessman who purchased the plant
five months before it was destroyed, will file a civil action suit
in the U.S. Court of Claims in hopes of obtaining restitution.
</P>
<P>
   He has retained the Washington law firm of Jones, Day, Reavis
and Pogue, which said in a statement that Idris will establish that
al-Shifa was ''engaged only in pharmaceutical processing and
packaging,'' with no connection to international terror.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton coupled the attack on the Khartoum facility with cruise
missile strikes against alleged terror camps in Afghanistan said to
have been under bin Laden's control.
</P>
<P>
   The statement by the law firm said the U.S. government has
retreated systematically from declarations that high officials made
two years ago to justify the attack on the plant, ''except for the
claim that a chemical component of VX nerve gas known as Empta was
found in a soil sample taken by a foreign agent near the plant.''
</P>
<P>
   It added that a study commissioned by Idris found no trace of
Empta in the ground soil and drainage sludge at al-Shifa but
instead found evidence of common pesticides with ''chemical
similarity'' to Empta.
</P>
<P>
   Idris said he has always opposed terrorism as a tool of
political action, has never met with bin Laden and has not
knowingly done business with him or any of his associates.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent administration comment on the issue, State
Department spokesman Philip Reeker stood by the initial
justification for the bombing. He said last week that evidence
suggests bin Laden was seeking to acquire weapons of mass
destruction, including chemical weapons, for use against American
targets. He said Empta, used to make chemical weapons, was found
outside the al-Shifa facility.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the nearly two years since the attack, the evidence about
the purpose of this chemical plant remains persuasive,'' Reeker
said.
</P>
<P>
   Idris said he understands the need of the U.S. government to
defend itself against acts of terror. ''But a government becomes
what it fears most when it lashes out against the innocent and then
fails to recognize its errors and make full restitution,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Washington Monument Reopens  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two years after scaffolding went up,
summertime tourists in the nation's capital will be able to visit
an unblemished Washington Monument again.
</P>
<P>
   First in line to ascend Monday, nearly two hours before the
ticket booth opened, were six members of the Dallman family of
Chesterfield, Mo., a suburb of St. Louis. Steve Dallman, vice
president of a chemical company, said the family learned of the
reopening three weeks ago through a school history project of
daughters Natalie, 12, and Katie, 11.
</P>
<P>
   Dallman, who said he last went up the monument 25 years ago,
when he was 13, found the newly cleaned monument ''astounding.''
''The view has always been beautiful,'' he said. ''It just looks
the way it should look.''
</P>
<P>
   A line of about 300 snaked around paths leading to the ticket
booth. Among the crowd were about 200 people in black and yellow
costumes adorned with hieroglyphics, members of the Ancient
Egyptian Order led by Dr. Orrin Bright, an Atlanta physician.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's to remind the world that the obelisk is an ancient
African symbol,'' he said. The monument takes the shape of an
Egyptian obelisk, although at 555 feet it rises more than five
times as high as the tallest standing true obelisk, a 97-foot-high
monument to Queen Hatshepsut at fabled Karnak Temple.
</P>
<P>
   Getting into the monument is a bit different from when the last
tourists peered from Washington's tallest structure. Under a new
system, the Washington Monument's free tickets must be used on a
day and at a time designated. A limited number are available at the
ticket booth or in advance from a commercial agency at $1.50 each,
plus 50 cents per order.
</P>
<P>
   The monument, closed since December, will be shuttered again
this December to complete the $10 million refurbishing. The
National Park Service hopes for a permanent reopening in February
or March, before the cherry blossoms bloom in a major Washington
rite of spring.
</P>
<P>
   During the closure, the monument's single elevator will get a
new cab with opaque walls that become transparent so passengers can
see some of the 193 memorial stones that line the surrounding
staircase.
</P>
<P>
   Workers have cleaned 94,000 square feet of surface, remortared
11.8 miles of joints and repaired 78 of the monument's 36,000
stones.

<HEADLINE> Punk Rocker, Kasich Cross Paths  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Just a couple of guys hanging out at the
bar: Ohio Rep. John Kasich and punk rock rebel Johnny Rotten.
</P>
<P>
   The two crossed paths at a reception Monday at Finnegan's Wake
Pub, Rotten wearing a luminescent yellow shirt and spiked red hair,
Kasich in a dark business suit.
</P>
<P>
   The Ohio Republican, perhaps confusing the Sex Pistols with the
Rolling Stones, told Rotten he should support George W. Bush
because he's a ''street fighting man.''
</P>
<P>
   Rotten was in Philadelphia working on his VH1 variety show. He
was constantly interrupted from enjoying his Murphy's Stout beer by
college-aged Republicans who wanted to pose for a picture with him.
</P>
<P>
   When one young man couldn't figure out how to use the camera,
Rotten urged him to ''go get a slave to do it for you.''
</P>
<P>
   After a brief chat about delivering music through the Internet,
Kasich got the Rotten thumbs-up.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's a nice chap,'' Rotten said. ''I like him. If he runs for
the president's job, I'd vote for him.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia's most famous mythical boxer was a no-show, but
light-heavyweight champion Roy Jones Jr. tried to put some fight in
the Republican Senate candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Jones flew from Pensacola, Fla., Monday night to be the featured
guest at a fund-raiser for GOP Senate candidates.
</P>
<P>
   In a soft voice, the boxer promoted an upcoming fight and urged
high-rollers and senators -- including the ''Louisville slugger''
Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky -- not to forget children.
</P>
<P>
   ''Stand up for people who can't help themselves -- the kids in
our society,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Former heavyweight boxer Michael Spinks was also in attendance,
as a huge portrait of his brother Leon towered above him. Two
heavyweight champs with roots in the Philadelphia region, Joe
Frazier and Larry Holmes, weren't around.
</P>
<P>
   And although his theme music played, neither was ''Rocky.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   A brief shudder of fear spread through the Hard Rock Cafe when
Arizona Sen. John McCain started speaking at a reception designed
to promote MTV's get-out-the-vote campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think I'll spend 40 minutes talking about the North Korean
nuclear buildup,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   Just a joke, folks. McCain instead told dozens of college
students that politicians often ignore their interests because too
many young people don't register to vote.
</P>
<P>
   One 19-year-old, Elizabeth Hess, said she was inspired to
register -- not necessarily by McCain, but because her mother
dragged her to the Hard Rock Cafe with her boyfriend.
</P>
<P>
   While McCain spoke, a newly minted member of the media filmed
him from behind. It was his wife Cindy, who was given a camera by
ABC's ''Good Morning America'' and asked to keep a video diary of
her week.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's make sure you get on national television,'' McCain told
his audience. ''When I say three, shout 'Good Morning America.'''
</P>
<P>
   No dissenters from the ''Today'' show were heard.
</P>
<P>

   Elizabeth Dole is known for her stroll while making a speech at
the 1996 Republican convention. She has another fond memory of the
campaign four years ago: a ''Tonight'' show appearance with Jay
Leno.
</P>
<P>
   Dole wore a black leather jacket and rode on a motorcycle with
Leno, making a few fancy moves with a stunt double's help.
</P>
<P>
   She smiled watching a tape of that moment Monday afternoon at a
testimonial luncheon sponsored by Lifetime Television.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many people thought that was the highlight of the campaign,''
said her husband, losing presidential candidate Bob Dole. ''I can't
remember any highlights of the campaign.''

<HEADLINE> Philippine Ambassador's Home Bombed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- A bomb exploded Tuesday at the home of
the ambassador of the Philippines in central Jakarta, witnesses
said. At least one person was killed and several injured.
</P>
<P>
   The blast happened at about 12:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Details were sketchy. However, witnesses and police at the scene
said the bomb appeared to have been hidden in a car parked outside
the home near several government offices as well as homes of other
foreign diplomats and senior government officials.
</P>
<P>
   The ambassador's home was severely damaged.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear who was in the home at the time or
if Ambassador Leonides Caday or other diplomatic staff were among
those killed or hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Office workers ran from their buildings nearby immediately after
the powerful blast, which shook the downtown area.
</P>
<P>
   No further details were immediately available.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Accuses GOP of Deception  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Sitting on the sidelines in warm and
humid Florida, President Clinton accused Republicans of using their
convention in Philadelphia to deceive the public.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their strategy is to talk about compassion and all that, and
it's a brilliant strategy, a pretty package, and they're hoping if
they wrap it tight enough, nobody will open it before Christmas,''
Clinton said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats must make sure that voters focus on the reality and
implications of GOP programs well before the November election,
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   In appearances in Tampa and Palm Beach, Clinton raised $1
million for Democratic Senate candidates, including Florida
Insurance Commissioner Bill Nelson.
</P>
<P>
   He dismissed the prescription drug plan drafted by House
Republicans as ''a bunch of baloney'' that would help drug
companies, not the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   He portrayed Republican-proposed tax cuts as the
will-of-the-wisp day dreams of people who spend lottery winnings
before they actually win any money.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted that the Treasury Department will pay off $221
billion of federal debt this year and called that ''the largest
one-year debt pay-down in American history, a giant step toward
paying off the entire national debt by 2012.
</P>
<P>
   Republican-backed tax cuts would prevent the government from
achieving that goal, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president ripped Republican plans and policies on the
environment, on maintaining economic prosperity, on education,
crime, health care, civil rights and raising the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now their strategy is to blur all that,'' Clinton said,
asserting that Republicans are using phrases like ''compassionate
conservatism'' to paper over the harshness of their programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're not bragging about shutting the government down twice
anymore, or trying to shut the Department of Education down, or
having the biggest Medicare and education and environmental cuts in
history,'' he said at the Palm Beach event. ''Gone is the harsh
rhetoric and mean words of 1992 through 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   He compared the Republican eagerness for tax cuts to
overindulgence in a cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every time I go to a cafeteria, everything I see looks good,
but if I eat it all, I'll get sick,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Republicans appear bent on spending the entire
surplus, even if emergencies arise for which the money is needed.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lot like getting one of those letters in the mail, the
one that says ''you MAY have won $10 million'', the president said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But did you go out and spend that $10 million the next day?''
he asked. ''If you did you should support Republicans in this
election. But if you didn't, you better stick with us.''
</P>
<P>
   The president planned to linger in Florida through Tuesday
afternoon, giving politics a momentary rest and focusing on his
golf game.

<HEADLINE> Nashville Wary After Cop Shootings  </HEADLINE>
By VICKI BROWN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- A motorist dies after a police stop. A
suspected robber is shot dead in his car. A store owner dies in a
barrage of police bullets. An autistic man dies under police
restraint.
</P>
<P>
   This famous city of the South is having an uneasy summer
following a bitter spring. In one four-week period, four people
died after confrontations with Nashville police -- all of them
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ''We should be standing up and saying this is enough,'' said
Timothy Forsythe, the father of 18-year-old Timothy Hayworth, the
robbery suspect fatally shot in March.
</P>
<P>
   Public outcry against deadly force by police has recently hit
fever pitch in New York and Los Angeles. Philadelphia's police also
came under scrutiny following the videotaped arrest of a suspected
carjacker.
</P>
<P>
   Now Nashville residents are questioning whether their police
force is adequately trained and monitored. They also fear the
deaths aren't coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems like there is a pattern going on where innocent
people of color are being killed,'' said Brendolyn Randolph, whose
son Larry Davis was killed after he was pulled over for speeding.
</P>
<P>
   Police Chief Emmett Turner, who became the city's first black
chief in 1996, said the department is reviewing its policies and
training.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm committed to having a professional police department, and
will do whatever is necessary to bring that about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The first police-related death was March 30 when a man matching
Hayworth's description tried to rob a jewelry store. Detectives
said he attempted to run them over and they opened fire. A pistol
was found in Hayworth's pants, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, 25, was shot April 9 after two officers stopped him for
speeding. They fired two shots as he drove away, hitting him in the
head and shoulder. Davis had no gun.
</P>
<P>
   On April 21, Chong Hwan An, 49, was shot by two officers when he
allegedly ignored their orders to drop his gun. He was shooting at
two people who had just robbed his beauty salon.
</P>
<P>
   And Calvin Champion, 32, died April 30 after police used pepper
spray and pulled him face-down on the ground. A caregiver from
Champion's group home had complained the autistic man was becoming
too aggressive toward her 3-year-old child. He later died.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the four deaths, a coach for a police-sponsored
sports league for children was charged in July with molesting boys,
and three officers are under investigation for allegedly
mistreating Hispanic residents when moonlighting as apartment
security guards.
</P>
<P>
   In the past six months, officers also have been punished for
statutory rape, falsifying traffic tickets, brokering off-duty
security jobs, drunken driving, sexual assault, drug use and
running a downtown sex club.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is too much scandal in a police department of this
size,'' said Ray Winbush, director of Fisk University's Office of
Race Relations. ''Something is wrong and has to be corrected.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner recently hired the Police Executive Research Forum, a
Washington-based consulting firm, to help the department regain the
public's confidence. Tony Narr, one of the consultants, said
officers and the community want to work together to bring about
positive changes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes you don't see that. Sometime there's a lot of
suspicion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A grand jury investigated all four deaths and found in each case
that the officers were justified in using deadly force. The
officers involved have since returned to patrol duty.
</P>
<P>
   A new civilian-led office of professional accountability,
established after the Hispanic harassment was reported last fall,
is still investigating one of the deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Known as ''Music City U.S.A.,'' ''the Athens of the South'' and
''the buckle of the Bible Belt,'' Nashville is home to the Southern
Baptist Convention, the Grand Ole Opry and Al Gore's campaign
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The city has grown in the last decade to a population of 530,000
that is 25 percent black, 2 percent Hispanic and 2 percent Asian,
according to U.S. Census projections.
</P>
<P>
   However, only 189 of the police department's 1,251 officers are
minorities and only about a dozen are fluent in a language other
than English, police spokesman Don Aaron said.
</P>
<P>
   Turner says recruiting minorities is difficult because of the
tight labor market and better-paying, less dangerous jobs in the
private sector. But, he said, a graduating class of 48 recruits in
June included eight blacks and one Korean.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Bill Purcell said personnel problems were unavoidable ''in
a department of this size, in a city that is growing in the ways
that ours has.''
</P>
<P>
   Victims' relatives, meanwhile, say they are resorting to
lawsuits and political pressure for justice.
</P>
<P>
   Ludye Wallace, a city councilman and president of the NAACP's
Nashville chapter, says blacks have long had problems with white
officers and the most recent incidents are ''a reminder of possible
sickness that might be within our city.''

<HEADLINE> W. Va. Rejoins South in GOP Region  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- West Virginia broke away from the South 137
years ago. Now, Republicans have voted it back.
</P>
<P>
   The vote Monday was just technical, and few delegates even paid
attention when the Republican National Convention passed a
resolution allowing West Virginia to join the GOP's Southern
region.
</P>
<P>
   ''West Virginia is going to be back with the South,'' GOP state
chairman David Tyson said. ''This vote is a moment of history, I do
believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   But some of his fellow West Virginians, when asked, didn't seem
to know what he was talking about.
</P>
<P>
   ''I do seem to remember David mentioning something about it to
me,'' was the response from Gov. Cecil Underwood, chairman of the
delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Civil War, Republican Party organizations have
grouped West Virginia for purposes of some regional meetings with
Ohio, Minnesota, the Dakotas and other Midwestern states.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have nothing in common with those people on issues, so we
feel we are better aligned with the South,'' Tyson said.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson said West Virginia has always had economic and social ties
with Virginia, Kentucky and the other Southern states. And they
have been together in all of the more modern economic councils and
collegiate sports conferences.
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia separated from Virginia to become the 35th state
in a move engineered by President Lincoln in 1863 at the height of
the Civil War. No sooner had that been done than the Army of
Northern Virginia marched through the new state en route to
disaster at Gettysburg, Pa., where the men of the 7th West Virginia
regiment fixed bayonets against them.

<HEADLINE> Labor Cozies Up to Republicans  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Among the corporations, trade groups and
other special interests feting Republicans this week are
organizations not normally aligned with the GOP: organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the nation's biggest labor unions are holding receptions
in honor of friendly congressional Republicans. And the Republican
National Committee saluted Teamsters President James Hoffa on
Monday night with the kind of reception usually reserved for big
donors.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a really positive sign, both for the Republican Party and
the labor movement,'' said Rep. Jack Quinn, R-N.Y., one of three
GOP lawmakers to be honored by 16 unions on Wednesday. ''It shows
we can reach out to other people and other factions, and it's very
positive for the labor movement because they know some Republicans
are willing to help them.''
</P>
<P>
   When Republicans captured the House in 1994, the GOP leadership
pushed legislation to restrict how unions spend their dues money,
supported a bill allowing employers to give comp time rather than
overtime and attacked ''union bosses.''
</P>
<P>
   But labor leaders are seeing the wisdom of reaching out to
supporters in both parties instead of pitching their tent firmly in
the Democratic camp.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every time we've accomplished everything, it has been a
bipartisan vote in the end,'' said Mary Elizabeth Teasley, director
of government relations for the National Education Association, or
NEA, the nation's largest labor union. ''We're going to build a
bipartisan majority, not a specific-party majority.''
</P>
<P>
   The RNC bash for Hoffa was the highest-profile evidence of
improving relations between the GOP and the Teamsters. Hoffa has
delighted Republicans by withholding a presidential endorsement by
his union until after Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   While many in the room sought a formal endorsement of George W.
Bush, most were realistic and hoped to achieve a lesser goal of
blocking the union from endorsing Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think there's enough time to grow the relationship to
get a full endorsement, but I think neutrality is a real
possibility,'' Pennsylvania Labor Secretary Johnny J. Butler said.
</P>
<P>
   Unions still give most of their money to Democrats. And while
there are 42 Republican members of the NEA who are delegates to the
convention here -- up from 15 in 1992 -- that number pales in
comparison with the 350 NEA members who will be delegates at the
Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles later this month.
</P>
<P>
   Still, organized labor is making an effort to cross party lines
at a time when the Republicans continue to control both houses of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our members didn't want us to be lap dogs for any political
party,'' said Andrew Stern, president of the 1.4-million member
Service Employees International Union, the health care workers'
union that is the largest in the AFL-CIO. ''They wanted us to be
watchdogs for their issues.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an effort cheered by Republican lawmakers who have opposed
their leadership's anti-union tilt.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hard-working people should be a base for us,'' said Rep. Peter
King, R-N.Y. ''And yet we've been driving them away.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican union members welcome the move across party lines.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Democratic Party has taken unions for granted,'' said
Geraldine Sam of Texas, a kindergarten teacher and NEA member who
is here as a Bush delegate. ''If unions are willing to come to the
party, we're willing to work with the unions.''
</P>
<P>
   To build bridges to the GOP, Stern called upon former Republican
National Chairman Richard Bond.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is nothing Republican or Democratic about a health care
worker being stuck by a dirty needle,'' Bond said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Marge Roukema of New Jersey, one of the GOP lawmakers
honored by SEIU on Monday night, has introduced legislation
requiring hospitals to use safer needles that protect health care
workers from accidental pricks.
</P>
<P>
   Others honored Monday were Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, for
his support of nursing home legislation; and Rep. Mark Foley of
Florida, for championing a bill that would protect health care
worker whistleblowers from retaliation.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the SEIU and 15 other unions, many of them
representing transportation workers, plan to honor Quinn, along
with Reps. Frank LoBiondo of New Jersey and Ray LaHood of Illinois.

<HEADLINE> BC-NY--Upstate Air,0472  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y.(AP) - The state Department of Environmental
Conservation is urging the federal Environmental Protection Agency
not to mark western New York as out of compliance for air quality.
</P>
<P>
   Even small excesses of ozone may mean the EPA can require
stiffer emissions standards for automobiles and industry - a move
some Rochester-area critics say would harm an already shaky upstate
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Simply put, such a designation will only make it that much
more difficult for our area to prosper,'' said Marvin E. Decker,
chairman of the Rochester-based Genesee Transportation Council.
</P>
<P>
   During measurements the DEC took from 1997 to 1999, four western
New York counties - Wayne, Niagara, Erie and Chautauqua - showed
levels of ozone in the air slightly higher than federal standards
allow.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say exceeding ozone standards even a little is
harmful to public health. But according to others, the excess in
western New York is not enough to cause harm.
</P>
<P>
   At ground level, ozone is a pollutant and one of the chief
components of smog. It can trigger asthma and other respiratory
ailments and levels of ozone above .08 parts per million in an
eight-hour period, exceed the federal standard.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, some levels are fractionally higher. In Wayne County,
ozone levels - measured at an air monitoring station in Williamson
- are .086 parts per million - 6 thousandths above the standard.
</P>
<P>
   In western New York, Erie County exceeds the ozone standard by
the smallest amount, at .085 parts per million. Chautauqua exceeds
it the most, at .089 parts per million.
</P>
<P>
   The Wayne County measurement, Decker told the Rochester Democrat
and Chronicle, could cause the entire Metropolitan Statistical Area
to be in violation of standards. That area includes Wayne, Monroe,
Ontario, Livingston, Genesee and Orleans counties.
</P>
<P>
   In upstate New York, slightly higher levels of ozone are too
small to harm health, said DEC spokeswoman Jennifer K. Post.
</P>
<P>
   One expert disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once you get above those (permitted) levels of ozone, you're
putting people at risk,'' said Peter Iwanowicz, director of
environmental health for the American Lung Association in Albany.
''We take these (higher levels) very seriously. A public health
response always dictates the most protective measures.''
</P>
<P>
   But according to Post, the boost in upstate levels of ozone are
in part the result of pollution transported from power plants in
the midwest and Canada - a factor western New York businesses and
motorists can do nothing about, said Post.
</P>
<P>
   The Nanticoke facility in Ontario, Canada, 63 miles west of
Buffalo, is one of the largest sources of ozone emissions in North
America.
</P>
<P>
   ''But you can't ignore the fact that some ozone is homegrown,''
the result of emissions from car tailpipes and factory
smokestacks,'' said Iwanowicz. ''The finger-pointing game only gets
you so far.''

<HEADLINE> Court Rules in Titanic Salvage Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- The company with salvage rights to the
Titanic has been blocked from cutting into the sunken ship by a
federal judge, who said a recent management change raises concerns
about what will happen to the artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge J. Calvitt Clarke Jr., acting without a
request, issued the order Friday, two days after the company,
R.M.S. Titanic, said it was looking for $300 million in lost
diamonds. He also repeated his ban on selling objects taken from
the wreck.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, R.M.S. Titanic stockholders fired the company's
old managers and picked new ones who pledged to speed up the
salvage operation.
</P>
<P>
   The new president, Arnie Geller, told Clarke in March about a
plan to cut into the Titanic this summer. The company later
scrapped the plan, saying the technology wasn't ready.
</P>
<P>
   But last Wednesday, R.M.S. Titanic said it would sell some
artifacts ''of non-historical and archaeological significance,''
including diamonds, gold and currency, from the wreck site.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Davis, an attorney for the company, said the judge's order
mainly clarified and reiterated previous rulings. He said Clarke
was aware that the company is selling chunks of Titanic coal and
used some coins found on the ship as collateral for loans.
</P>
<P>
   The court has ruled that Titanic artifacts can only be sold as a
single collection for public display. R.M.S. Titanic has raised
money for salvage operations with traveling exhibitions of Titanic
artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   R.M.S. Titanic was awarded sole salvor status by Clarke in 1992
but has been salvaging the wreck since 1987. It has conducted five
expeditions, recovering 5,000 items from the wreck site in the
North Atlantic, about 400 miles off Newfoundland.

<HEADLINE> Red Sox 8, Mariners 5  </HEADLINE>
By JIM COUR
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Jason Varitek hit a three-run homer in the eighth
inning as the Boston Red Sox rallied to beat the Seattle Mariners
8-5 Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 5-4, the Red Sox got singles from Scott Hatteberg and
Mike Lansing off Jose Mesa (3-6) to put runners at the corners with
two outs. Closer Kazuhiro Sasaki came in and allowed an RBI single
to Trot Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Varitek, a former Mariners' top draft choice, then hit a drive
into the right-field bleachers for his eighth homer. It was
Sasaki's third blown save in 28 opportunities and first since June
14, a stretch of 15 consecutive successful saves.
</P>
<P>
   Rich Garces (6-0) pitched a scoreless seventh to get the
victory. Hipolito Pichardo, who struck out in the ninth, pitched
two innings for his first save.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners had only three hits off six Boston pitchers,
including two by Rickey Henderson and a grand slam by Jay Buhner in
the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner and Henderson are the two Mariners who will lose the most
playing time because of the arrival of Al Martin in Monday's trade
with San Diego. Martin will back up Henderson in left field and
Buhner in right.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner's ninth career grand slam came after Ramon Martinez
walked Henderson, Alex Rodriguez and Edgar Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson, baseball's career stolen base leader, had three
steals and 22 since joining the Mariners on May 17.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox came back in the second to score three runs off Paul
Abbott on Nomar Garciaparra's his 16th homer, an error by third
baseman David Bell, and a sacrifice fly by Mike Lansing.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott allowed four runs -- two earned -- and six hits in 5 1-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners made it 5-3 in the bottom of the inning on
Rodriguez's RBI groundout. In the sixth, Lansing had an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez allowed five runs, one hit and five walks in one-plus
inning. He has a 46.29 in two starts against Seattle.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Red Sox placed 2B Jose Offerman on the DL with a
bruised left knee retroactive to July 30. INF Morgan Burkhart was
recalled from Triple-A Pawtucket. The team requested unconditional
release waivers on INF Mike Stanley. ... The Mariners sent IF-OF
John Mabry and minor league pitcher Tom Davey to San Diego. ...
Buhner is 4-for-7 with two homers, both this season, and a double
in his career against Martinez. ... After Henderson's single in the
second, he had reached base eight consecutive times; two hits and
six walks. ... Henderson stole three bases in a game for the first
time since July 16, 1999, for the Mets at Tampa Bay.

<HEADLINE> Dennis Miller Opens On MNF  </HEADLINE>
By HOWARD FENDRICH
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dennis Miller produced what was expected -- and wouldn't be from
anyone else with a football broadcasting job.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the first quarter of his debut on ''Monday Night
Football,'' the comedian already had made references to the Vatican
and male genitalia -- though not, thankfully, in the same sentence.
</P>
<P>
   There were also remarks about the Socratic method, the Rosetta
stone and the Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Sergio Leone got a
mention, too.
</P>
<P>
   Miller gave an uneven performance during the preseason Hall of
Fame Game between the San Francisco 49ers and New England Patriots,
mixing witty non-sequiturs with on-the-job training.
</P>
<P>
   Play-by-play announcer Al Michaels, the lone holdover on an
otherwise overhauled cast, summed up the broadcast in the closing
seconds of New England's 20-0 victory, saying to Miller, ''It's
like you won a prize to a fantasy announcing camp, isn't it?''
</P>
<P>
   Miller was hired in June as ABC Sports tried to perk up a
program that has seen ratings decline for five straight seasons.
Nielsen numbers for Miller's first outing were expected Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Miller kept his wry rants far shorter, and cleaner, than he does
on HBO's ''Dennis Miller Live'' (which Michaels duly plugged in the
second quarter).
</P>
<P>
   Much of what Miller said early on sounded like scripted jokes.
He even could be heard setting one up during the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   As Eric Dickerson, one of two new sideline reporters hired by
producer Don Ohlmeyer, began an interview with 49ers assistant
Ronnie Lott, Miller's voice awkwardly intruded with the comment,
''I've got a good Lott line.''
</P>
<P>
   When Dickerson finished, Miller delivered the line:
''Ironically, a guy named 'Lott' was the guy who turned the other
guys into pillars of salt.''
</P>
<P>
   That's OK coming from an announcer if it sounds like it's off
the top of his head, but very little did in Miller's case during
the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it was as if he had carefully studied the team's rosters
and written down riffs on names.
</P>
<P>
   On Patriots Pro Bowl safety Lawyer Milloy playing special teams:
''You know lawyers -- they get paid by the hour.''
</P>
<P>
   On San Francisco's Jeff Garcia: ''He's the Canadian league
import with the Mexican-sounding name. A NAFTA quarterback. And,
trust me, they'll feel free to trade him if it doesn't pan out this
year.''
</P>
<P>
   And when 49ers rookie receiver Eric Chew was involved in a play,
Miller couldn't resist mentioning regurgitation.
</P>
<P>
   As the show progressed, though, Miller did gel better with
Michaels and the other announcer in the booth, Hall of Fame
quarterback Dan Fouts.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, clearly the showpiece of the new ''Monday Night
Football'' crew, didn't appear on-camera until 6 minutes into the
broadcast, as Michaels first introduced viewers to his other new
cohorts -- Dickerson and Melissa Stark on the sidelines (replacing
Lesley Visser), then new Xs-and-Os analyst Fouts (replacing Boomer
Esiason).
</P>
<P>
   When Miller, with tie knot loosened, finally spoke, he served up
what many were waiting for: ''As far as my personal approach to the
game, well, I know a lot of you people are thinking that I won't
take this seriously. But I just want you to know it is a game, but
I also realize it's a game many of you take seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not the Vatican, but then again the pope doesn't have to
go across the middle on guys like Ronnie Lott very frequently.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohlmeyer liked his new product.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had some rough spots, but overall it was a good start,''
the producer said. ''I was really pleased with our announcers for
the first game. I thought Eric and Melissa had a nice debut, and
the trio in the booth has a chance to be something special.''
</P>
<P>
   Some other observations from the irreverent and irony-loving
Miller:
</P>
<P>
   -- ''It's kind of odd to be here at Canton, the Tigris and
Euphrates of football history, and look down at an artificial
(turf) field, though.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ''I'm not sure there's such a thing as minor groin surgery.
Anyone has a sharp instrument around my genitalia, I'm thinking
it's major.''
</P>
<P>
   -- On Patriots coach Bill Belichick: ''He blinks about as
frequently as Clint Eastwood in a Sergio Leone film.''
</P>
<P>
   -- On the experimental ''Umpcam,'' a camera the size of lipstick
affixed to the bill of the umpire's cap: ''The angle looked lower.
I think that's the new 'Cupcam.'''
</P>
<P>
   Michaels noted there had been no need to use the censor button.
That was a measure of success for Miller, but it remains to be seen
if his ''Monday Night Football'' shtick -- toned down from his HBO
persona in terms of language and pace, but still obscure at times --
will work with viewers over the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, whose next test comes at the Aug. 14 preseason game
between the St. Louis Rams and Tennessee Titans, even unveiled what
he said could be used as a wrapup line when a game's outcome is no
longer in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ''Start blow-drying Teddy Koppel's hair, 'cause this one's
done,'' Miller said, referring to the host of ABC's ''Nightline.''
After chuckling from Fouts and Michaels, Miller continued,
''Actually, I used the Ouija board on that one. ... He hasn't been
called Teddy since he was an embryo.''

<HEADLINE> Patriots 20, 49ers 0  </HEADLINE>
By RUSTY MILLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANTON, Ohio (AP) -- Despite first-game jitters in their new
jobs, Bill Belichick and Dennis Miller got off to good starts.
</P>
<P>
   On a night for fresh approaches, Kevin Faulk set up one
touchdown and scored another and Michael Bishop accounted for two
scores as the Patriots beat the San Francisco 49ers 20-0 in the Pro
Football Hall of Fame exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick won his first game as New England's head coach, and
Miller appeared to be a fan favorite in his first game as a member
of the ''Monday Night Football'' announcing crew.
</P>
<P>
   ''The thing that I was most happy with is that we played hard,
and I've tried to emphasize that from day one,'' Belichick said.
''Coming to the Hall of Fame -- the legends we've been around here --
is really good for everybody on our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller joined Dan Fouts and Al Michaels in the ABC booth in an
effort to turn around a steady five-year decline in the show's
ratings. His irreverent style and caustic perspective are expected
to add a new segment of viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Before the first points were scored, Miller had already scored
points with one-liners dealing with the Vatican, male genitalia and
the Tigris and Euphrates rivers.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 22,840 thinned out as the second half progressed in
the preseason opener for both teams. The loudest cheers of the
fourth quarter came when the fans began chanting, ''Den-nis!
Den-nis! Den-nis!'' and tried to get Miller to pop his head out of
the press box.
</P>
<P>
   New England quarterback Drew Bledsoe only played the first
series. He was 2-of-3 for 20 yards before giving way to Bishop.
</P>
<P>
   Besides throwing the TD pass to Faulk, Bishop also scored on a
22-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was nice to take a few snaps and get an opportunity out
there,'' Bishop said. ''I got to learn from my mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Raymont Harris, a former Ohio State tailback, carried seven
times for 42 yards on New England's second possession, which ended
on Adam Vinatieri's 21-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was a heck of a performance by Raymont on that drive,''
Bledsoe said. ''I'm really, really excited to see that and can't
wait to work with him for the whole season.''
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the second quarter, Faulk returned a punt 22
yards to the San Francisco 22. Four plays later, Vinatieri made it
6-0 with a 39-yard kick.
</P>
<P>
   Faulk, a second-year back out of LSU, grabbed a short slant pass
from Bishop and avoided three tackles, cutting back to the middle
for a 25-yard touchdown just before the half ended.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, three players who spent all or most of their
careers with the 49ers were inducted into the Hall of Fame:
quarterback Joe Montana, defensive back Ronnie Lott and linebacker
Dave Wilcox. Joining them in the class of 2000 were former Raiders
lineman Howie Long and Pittsburgh owner Dan Rooney.
</P>
<P>
   That was about it for the San Francisco highlights. There
weren't many during the game itself.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Montana back on the sidelines again, the 49ers still
floundered.
</P>
<P>
   They managed just four first downs in the opening half --
matching the number of times their quarterbacks were sacked.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, we've sure got some work to do,'' San Francisco
coach Steve Mariucci said. ''The thing you've got to remember is
that to every season there is a start, a journey and a finish.
We've got a long way to go in every area. But this is where we
start.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Garcia was 6-of-7 for 50 yards, while rookies Giovanni
Carmazzi and Tim Rattay, the 49ers' third- and seventh-round draft
picks, both had off nights. Carmazzi was 3-for-7 for 19 yards
passing and Rattay was 10-of-21 for 105 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers' Jerry Rice, the NFL's leading career receiver
beginning his 16th season, had one catch for 4 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Belichick was the head coach of the Cleveland Browns for five
seasons, including in 1995 when Art Modell moved the franchise to
Baltimore. Partisan Browns fans were expected to boo Belichick
during pregame introductions, but Belichick's name was not
announced.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a great football area. The tradition just oozes out,''
Belichick said. ''And it's a thrill to be back. I'm sure there were
mixed opinions of me, but that's their opinions and I can't worry
about it.''

<HEADLINE> NFL Camps Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   Priest Holmes had every reason to be wary of Jamal
Lewis, the
Baltimore Ravens' top pick in the 2000 draft.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Instead, Holmes welcomed the rookie running back to training
camp and went out of his way to prepare him for the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be hard to be threatened because I've been playing so
long,'' Holmes said Monday. ''I have a very good work ethic and I
believe in Christ, and those two things are hard to beat.''
</P>
<P>
   Now in his fourth season, Holmes ran for 1,008 yards in 1998 and
averaged 5.7 yards last year as the backup to Errict Rhett, who
left for Cleveland during the offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ''First of all, Priest is a heck of a running back,'' Ravens
fullback Chuck Evans said. ''It takes a lot to get 1,000 yards in
the NFL. He's a good guy, a perfect human being. The guy just works
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes remains the No. 1 running back, but there's no telling
how the depth chart will look after Lewis returns from the
dislocated elbow he received in Friday's scrimmage against the
Washington Redskins.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes couldn't care less. He figures he'll get his carries, and
he looks forward to the time when Lewis returns.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to save the hits off me,'' Holmes said. ''I know
Jamal is going to be in there on third-and-1, and that's one less
hit I'll have to take. It should help me in terms of speed and
endurance.''
</P>
<P>
   Holmes just isn't saying that. He has proved he's unselfish, as
exhibited by his rapport with fans who attend Ravens training camp.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't a hat, or a piece of paper or a football that he
won't sign. He doesn't put his name down, either. He talks with
each fan as if he's a friend.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was out there for an hour Saturday, and when I got done he
was still out there,'' coach Brian Billick said.
</P>
<P>
   Holmes isn't interested in his own numbers. He just wants to
win, and he figures Lewis can make it happen. If it means Holmes
get less carries and less notoriety, then so be it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'll give him all my knowledge, because the goal is to get to
the playoffs. It's a big year for me, whether I get 200 snaps or 89
like I did last year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Jamal can add size and punch. He's got the power, I've got the
speed. Nothing changes,'' Holmes added. ''I'm still going to run
60-yard touchdowns this year; I do it every year. But there are
times we need a bigger back to push the line back.''
Giants:
</P>
<P>
   Starting free safety Shaun Williams will miss Saturday's
preseason opener against Chicago with a sprained left big toe.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was hurt on the first play of last Saturday's
intrasquad scrimmage when someone rolled onto the back of his foot.
He is expected to miss 1-2 weeks, but could be out longer. The
encouraging news, according to coach Jim Fassel, is that X-rays
were negative and the swelling eased.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, who is on crutches and walking with a protective boot,
will be replaced by Lyle West, the Giants' sixth-round pick last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Pro Bowl defensive end Michael Strahan spent Monday in
Manhattan, his fourth straight absence, to have doctors and his
chiropractor loosen his stiff back. He will not play against
Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Sean Bennett returned to practice Monday after
missing a week with a bulging disc in his lower back.
Bengals:
</P>
<P>
   Center Rich Braham will have surgery to remove a bursa sac from
his right knee and might miss the season opener against Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Braham, limited by swelling and soreness in the knee during
training camp, decided on surgery Monday. Trainer Paul Sparling
estimated he will be out 3-5 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Braham is the only player on the Bengals' roster who has started
an NFL game at center. Fourth-year veteran Brock Gutierrez, who has
played guard and center, is expected to start Cincinnati's
preseason game Friday in Buffalo.
Broncos:
</P>
<P>
   Running back Olandis Gary returned to practice Monday for the
first time since straining his right hamstring more than a week
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gary, who strained his hamstring July 23 during Denver's first
full-pad workout, ran without any visible limp, and coach Mike
Shanahan was optimistic about his recovery.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought he looked fairly good,'' Shanahan said. ''You can
see he's not full speed, but he's making some strides.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Gary, running back Terrell Davis has been held out of
some practices as he returns from knee surgery. Davis said he
expects to play in the team's first preseason game Saturday at
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm excited about this weekend,'' he said. ''Hopefully, I'll
get a significant amount of carries and some playing time.
Hopefully, I'll come out OK and look at film and say, 'I'm
back.'''
Seahawks:
</P>
<P>
   Sean Dawkins, an eight-year veteran receiver, injured a toe in
Sunday's scrimmage and missed practice Monday. Coach Mike Holmgren
didn't know how long Dawkins, who returned to camp last Wednesday
after being cut and re-signed, would be sidelined.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Derrick Mayes returned to practice Monday after a
hamstring injury. Dawkins and Mayes are the team's top receivers
since Joey Galloway was traded to Dallas.

<HEADLINE> NBA Trades, Signings To Resume  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of the top four NBA free agents, three are headed to Florida.
The latest is Eddie Jones, who is on the verge of going to Miami in
a nine-player blockbuster trade.
</P>
<P>
   July began with Tim Duncan turning down Orlando, while Grant
Hill and Tracy McGrady decided to join the Magic. Now that it's
August, trades and free-agent signings can resume.
</P>
<P>
   While trades involving Allen Iverson, Patrick Ewing and Shawn
Kemp were still in the rumor stage, the word is already out on the
deal between the Hornets and Heat.
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte was set to send Jones, Anthony Mason, Ricky Davis and
Dale Ellis to Miami for P.J. Brown, Jamal Mashburn, Otis Thorpe,
Tim James and Rodney Buford.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was the latest player to decide against signing with the
Bulls, whose grand plan to stockpile salary cap room for this
summer has turned into a grand failure. Chicago, which thought it
could at least get McGrady and Jones, might end up with no more
than Ron Mercer and Brad Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was considering the Bulls until Monday morning, but
decided it would be better to wait and see.
</P>
<P>
   ''About 9:30 this morning Eddie told me, 'Mama, I may have to go
to Chicago because Charlotte and Miami can't come up with a
deal,''' Jones' mother, Frances Thigpen, told the Miami Herald. ''I
said, 'We have to start sending up some timber -- we have to pray.'
He said, 'Yeah, Mama, pray for me.'''
</P>
<P>
   Orlando is expected to wait until Thursday to announce the
signings of Hill and McGrady, which will give the Magic 48 hours to
find a rebounder, perhaps Maurice Taylor, to replace Ben Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   Wallace and Orlando reserve guard Chucky Atkins are both headed
to Detroit, which is using Hill's salary cap space on the two Magic
defectors.
</P>
<P>
   The Toronto Raptors were hoping to land Indiana's Austin
Croshere, but that can only happen if the Pacers allow themselves
to be outbid. The Raptors also liked Houston's Cuttino Mobley, but
he has decided to stay with the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs are trying to convince the Clippers' Derek Anderson to
join them, while the Boston Celtics are exploring numerous
sign-and-trade options involving their free-agent power forward,
Danny Fortson, who is coveted by the Golden State Warriors and New
York Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   Portland forward Brian Grant opted out of the final four years
and $41 million of his contract to become a free agent, and he
could sign an even more lucrative deal as part of a sign-and-trade
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers are reportedly interested in a sign-and-trade
sending Grant and another player to Cleveland for Kemp.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shawn would look forward to going to Portland and winning a
championship, which has always been his goal,'' said Kemp's agent,
Tony Dutt.
</P>
<P>
   Other big-name rumors being reported in various media outlets
included Iverson to the Pistons in a three-way deal (with Jerry
Stackhouse, Jerome Williams and Glen Rice to the 76ers; Matt Geiger
to the Pistons and Christian Laettner to the Lakers) and Ewing to
Portland for Grant and Jermaine O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   There also was speculation that Charlotte, after acquiring Brown
from Miami, would reroute him to the Lakers for Rice.
</P>
<P>
   As for Chicago, no one is quite certain what will happen.
</P>
<P>
   Duncan and Hill showed no interest in going there despite the
Bulls' ability to pay them maximum salaries. McGrady went to
Chicago for a recruiting trip, only to spurn the Bulls in favor of
a warm climate.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Thomas listened to Chicago, too, but turned the Bulls'
interest into lucrative leverage that will keep him in Milwaukee
with the Bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Having been turned down by most of the marquee names, Chicago
may choose to pursue several B-list free agents -- from Mercer to
Derek Anderson to Jahidi White to Miller -- or decide to pack it in
for another year and wait for the salary cap to jump, perhaps by as
much as $8 million, heading into the 2001-02 season.
</P>
<P>
   Mercer drew interest from the Nets, but New Jersey has
insufficient salary-cap room to sign him after being denied an
injury exception of $3.8 million by the league office on Monday.
The Nets asked for the exception because Jayson Williams can no
longer play, but the league turned it down -- along with a request
for an injury exception for Kerry Kittles -- because the Nets waited
more than six months from the day of Williams' injury to apply.
</P>
<P>
   Several players, most notably Duncan, will stick with their own
teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Eastern Conference champion Indiana Pacers, with the
possible exception of Croshere, should remain intact despite having
four free-agent starters -- Jalen Rose, Reggie Miller, Rik Smits and
Mark Jackson. All are expected to re-sign, with Rose reportedly
getting the maximum allowable salary -- about $9.2 to $9.6 million
for next season -- under terms of the collective bargaining
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Antonio Daniels, a close friend of Duncan's, will stay with the
Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   Rashard Lewis, who entered the NBA straight out of high school
three years ago, will remain in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Eisley should remain in Utah as the heir apparent to John
Stockton at point guard, Joe Smith will stay in Minnesota, and Tim
Hardaway should do the same in Miami. Toni Kukoc could re-sign with
Philadelphia, although the sides were said to be far apart on
money.

<HEADLINE> Everybody Wants a Piece of Woods  </HEADLINE>
By MARY FOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Seven-year-old golfer Jamal Gaddis became
famous overnight. Not for his game, but because his friends found
out he was chosen to play on the same course with Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were all like, 'Wow, man, how'd you get to do that?'''
Gaddis said. ''They all wish they were me.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaddis was one of 125 kids selected to be part of the clinic the
Tiger Woods Foundation put on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the biggest thrill of my life,'' said Richard Linehop,
13, of LaPlace. ''He's everything I want to be. He's really good at
golf and he's rich. That's what I hope to do.''
</P>
<P>
   While adults across the city tried to beg, buy or browbeat their
way into the clinic, Woods closed the events to the public.
</P>
<P>
   To discourage those hoping to get too close to him, Woods was
flanked by his own security men, beginning with a dinner and
auction Sunday night that benefited the Tiger Woods Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, more than 50 New Orleans police circled the golf
course where the clinic was scheduled. Only those with credentials
-- golfers, guests and media -- got through the roadblocks and past
the fence.
</P>
<P>
   There was little doubt that Woods' mind was on his work, not his
stardom.
</P>
<P>
   By 9:30 a.m., Woods was on the course with 25 youngsters, well
away from the reporters and fans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got to see Michael Jordan when he was in New Orleans, now I
get to see Tiger Woods,'' said Julian Polk, 11, who has played golf
for three years. ''Jordan used to be my favorite in the world. Now,
Tiger is.''
</P>
<P>
   Heavy rain and lightning cleared the course about an hour into
Woods' first session. While the kids waiting their turn scrambled
for cover with their parents, Woods and the 25 youngsters he had
been working with huddled under a tent.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had a Q&AMP;A session in the tent,'' Woods said. ''They asked a
lot of good questions.''
</P>
<P>
   The queries ranged from the British Open to the benefits of
meditation. And when the event was forced from the course to the
Municipal Auditorium, where 3,500 school kids waited for Woods, the
scope widened to include such things as his monthly income, his
religion and if he thought there should be more opportunity for
female golfers.
</P>
<P>
   ''The kids are pretty intelligent,'' Woods said. ''It's just
that a lot of time they're just too shy to let that inquisitiveness
come out. And when you make them feel comfortable, it's amazing how
they relax and everything just flows.''
</P>
<P>
   For an hour, Woods made his audience of youngsters, parents and
others comfortable. He fielded questions easily, mixing laugh lines
with inspirational messages about what it takes to combine
athletics and studies, why rules are important, and how to make the
most of life.
</P>
<P>
   Then, taking a golf ball from a kid in the audience, Woods
wrapped up the day by repeating his trick of bouncing the ball on
the face of a golf club.
</P>
<P>
   ''What do I get out of this?'' Woods said. ''Tremendous
enjoyment. There's no dollar amount that you can put on a kid's
genuine smile.''

<HEADLINE> Golfer Michael Clark Wins Deere  </HEADLINE>
By JAY HUGHES
<TEXT>
<P>
   SILVIS, Ill. (AP) -- Michael Clark won his first PGA tournament,
a deer he can display in his house and a Deere for his yard.
</P>
<P>
   He collected all three, plus a $468,000 paycheck, on Monday when
he became the sixth first-time winner this season by rolling in a
12-foot birdie putt on the fourth playoff hole to beat veteran Kirk
Triplett in the rain-delayed John Deere Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, an avid hunter, plans to prominently display the trophy --
which features a statue of a running deer -- in the new house he and
his wife recently bought in Dalton, Ga. That is, assuming it passes
muster with his wife, Ryndee. Clark said she hid his mounted
10-point deer head in a closet when they moved.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw that trophy at the beginning of the week and I said,
'They've got a nice buck on there. That would look nice on my
mantle,''' Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   A self-described ''good old boy,'' Clark finished 11th in
Q-school last November to get his tour card. The win earned him a
two-year PGA Tour exemption.
</P>
<P>
   Tournament sponsor Deere &AMP; Co. also threw in one of its
green-and-yellow lawn tractors, something Clark said he's wanted
for a while. Part of his paycheck might go for more equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now I can get a front-end loader. ... I can get all the things
I want. I'm dead serious,'' said Clark, whose best previous finish
this season was a tie for 13th at the Compaq Classic in New
Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   In a final round suspended Sunday because of heavy rain, Clark
shot a 4-under 67, but Triplett birdied the final hole of
regulation to force the tie in a tournament-record 19-under 265.
Triplett, whose victory in the Nissan Open this year was his career
first, had a final-round 70.
</P>
<P>
   Both players twice made birdies to keep the playoff going.
Triplett earned $280,000 of the $2.6 million purse, helping his bid
to make the Presidents Cup team in October.
</P>
<P>
   Triplett, who was 2 over in nine holes before thunderstorms
suspended play Sunday, said the rain delay helped him. He said he
played more aggressively Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not too often you get a second chance at the last round
in the same tournament,'' he said. ''I just had good aggressive
focus all day because I was always behind and I always needed to
make birdie.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Howell, who turned pro last month after winning the NCAA
championship at Oklahoma State, had a 66 and finished one stroke
out of the playoff. He earned $176,800, boosting his yearly
earnings high enough to earn a special tour exemption.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is more than I had expected this week,'' said Howell, who
is still carrying his college bag.
</P>
<P>
   Clark led by one when play was suspended and started getting
himself mentally ready for the playoff when Triplett's final-hole
approach wound up in birdie range. Clark said he relied on
experience from losing a playoff on the old Nike Tour, now the
Buy.Com Tour, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I heard Triplett knocked it close, I more or less had
given him the putt mentally and knew we were going to the
playoff,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, who plans to play The International in Castle Rock,
Colo., next weekend, said he hopes to collect another victory soon.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want more people to know who Mike Clark is instead of
everybody this week going, 'Who?''' he said.

<HEADLINE> 'X-Files' Crew Member Electrocuted  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN SANTOS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A member of a television production crew
working on an episode of the hit television series ''The X-Files''
was electrocuted and six others were injured Monday when an
electrical line sent a 4,800-volt charge through the scaffold they
were using.
</P>
<P>
   ''It charged the entire scaffolding,'' Fire Department spokesman
Jim Wells said. Six people were standing on the scaffolding, and a
seventh person was on the ground, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear how the power line came into contact with the
scaffolding, which was set up 15 feet above the ground at the back
of a three-story apartment building, Wells said.
</P>
<P>
   The crew was working on the season premiere of ''The X-Files,''
the spooky series about the paranormal produced by 20th Century
Fox, said Steven Melnick, the studio's vice president of media
relations.
</P>
<P>
   Melnick identified the man killed as Jim Engh. Melnick said he
did not know his age or how long he had worked for the show. Engh
had been on the scaffolding.
</P>
<P>
   A second person was hospitalized in serious condition after
earlier being listed in critical condition, Melnick said. The other
five victims were treated and released, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''All of us are deeply saddened by the tragic loss of our friend
and colleague Jim Engh,'' Chris Carter, creator and executive
producer of ''The X-Files,'' said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our hearts go out to his family and friends. He will be deeply
missed by all who have known him and worked with him,'' Carter
said. ''Our thoughts and prayers are with the other crew members
who were injured. We wish them a speedy recovery.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a production notice at the scene, the crew was
preparing for a scene involving dialogue, a foot chase down an
interior rear stairwell and rain effects on rear stair windows.
</P>
<P>
   Filming at the location was to begin Tuesday, Melnick said. He
said he was not sure if the filming would go forward as planned.
None of the actors in the series, which stars Gillian Anderson and
David Duchovny, was present when the accident occurred.

<HEADLINE> Satellites Beam US Into Convention  </HEADLINE>
By LAURA MECKLER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- George W. Bush arrived at his convention
early, beamed to cheering delegates via satellite, though he may
have been upstaged by another satellite import -- a gospel-preaching
local minister who rocked the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   With images filling giant screens, delegates to the Republican
National Convention loved the show.
</P>
<P>
   Embracing new technology, convention organizers are using more
remote satellite feeds than ever before to bring coast-to-coast
symbols of America right into their arena.
</P>
<P>
   Later this week, satellite hookups will fill the hall with a war
hero aboard a battleship, a New Jersey senior talking about Social
Security and a tour of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles,
a monument to the victims of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   ''We wanted to show this is a coast-to-coast convention,'' said
Andy Card, the convention's co-chairman. ''We're reaching out
beyond our hall and beyond our party.''
</P>
<P>
   The outreach includes a series of videos on social programs
around the country that work without the benefit of government. On
Wednesday, video tributes will honor former Republican presidents,
and on Thursday, a biographical film will tell the Texas governor's
story.
</P>
<P>
   Political conventions, already made-for-TV productions, are now
having TV productions made for them.
</P>
<P>
   The videos fill the First Union Center,projected onto a 25-by-16
foot center screen and a pair of 9&AMP;frac12; by 12 foot screens on either
side.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're very slick,'' said Keith Martin, senior anchor at
WBRE-TV in Wilkes-Barre, Pa. ''They have a huge budget. I'm
jealous.''
</P>
<P>
   Satellites have long been used to show the presidential nominee
making his way from his hotel to the convention floor. In 1996,
Democrats expanded on the concept, beaming President Clinton into
his convention each day as he rode a campaign train to Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Now Republicans are taking the next step. Bush will appear each
day, but he's not the only one.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, retired Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf will talk
tough from the deck of the USS New Jersey in Camden, N.J. On
Wednesday, Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan will lead a tour of
the Weisenthal Center.
</P>
<P>
   Convention spokeswoman Leslie Goodman said there are concerns,
particularly about the Schwarzkopf feed.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have to worry about weather and worry about line of
sight,'' she said. ''It's a much less controlled environment,
especially when you're going into a live show. These are things
that haven't been done before.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, House Speaker Dennis Hastert formally opened the
convention via satellite from historic Carpenter Hall. Later,
delegates heard the Rev. Herbert Lusk of Philadelphia's Greater
Exodus Baptist Community Revitalization Church preach the gospel of
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are supporting Governor Bush because we know he gives faith
a chance,'' Lusk thundered to a cheering congregation, revival
style. ''Mr. Bush, we are praying for you. Keep the faith. We love
you!''
</P>
<P>
   The delegates loved Lusk.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's almost like it came into the building,'' said Ann Bock of
Indiana, Pa. ''It seemed to take us with it.''
</P>
<P>
   And they got more excited when Bush appeared on the big screens
from the campaign trail in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   But, as even his partisans noticed, Bush looked a little stiff
as he spoke to the camera from a classroom. Behind him were
motionless students seated and straight-faced.
</P>
<P>
   ''He felt a little nervous in front of the camera, don't you
think?'' said Dick Alderson of Westchester, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Wilson of Macon, Miss., figured it's probably difficult to
speak in a silent room into a camera that's being projected for a
cheering convention crowd. But he figures most of his fellow
delegates were pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ''Delegates certainly love the nominee,'' he said, ''so the more
they see of him the happier they are.''

<HEADLINE> Baseball Trades Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   B.J. Surhoff, Will Clark and Al Martin, welcome to the pennant
race.
</P>
<P>
   All three joined first-place teams Monday, part of 11 deals that
came before the afternoon trading deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Rondell White, Tom Goodwin, Steve Trachsel, Todd Hollandsworth
and Henry Rodriguez also moved. In all, more than 100 players
changed places in the last month -- Detroit was the only club that
did not make a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a very volatile market,'' New York Yankees general
manager Brian Cashman said.
</P>
<P>
   From now on, all trades require putting players through waivers,
often a tricky proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta boosted its outfield by getting Surhoff from Baltimore
and St. Louis got Will Clark from the Orioles to fill in for
injured Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   But several players mentioned prominently in trade talks -- Juan
Gonzalez, John Wetteland, Jeromy Burnitz and Rico Brogna -- stayed
put.
</P>
<P>
   Brogna had heard, and hoped, he was heading to the Boston Red
Sox. When the Philadelphia first baseman found out he wasn't
moving, he nearly left the Phillies before their game at San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought very seriously about calling the bellman and telling
him to come get my luggage and then flying home,'' Brogna said.
</P>
<P>
   The AL East-leading New York Yankees, linked to most every
available star, did nothing Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, the two-time World Series champions had already
traded for David Justice, Denny Neagle, Glenallen Hill and Jose
Vizcaino in the last month.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not easy trying to line up matches with people, whether
it's payroll, talent or a whole lot of other issues,'' Cashman
said. ''Some big names got floated out there. I'm comfortable with
the team we have.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who turned down a trade to the Yankees in June, was
pursued by Seattle. But the AL West leaders could not close a deal
for the Detroit slugger.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were optimistic,'' Mariners general manager Pat Gillick
said. ''It was a decision that was made by the Tigers. The ball was
in their court.''
</P>
<P>
   After missing out on the two-time MVP, the Mariners acquired
another outfielder, getting Martin from San Diego for first
baseman-outfielder John Mabry and a minor league pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles were in the middle of two big trades, sending Clark
and cash to St. Louis for third base prospect Jose Leon and moving
Surhoff to Atlanta in a five-player deal.
</P>
<P>
   Minus McGwire, the NL Central-leading Cardinals felt compelled
to add a bat at first base.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire went on the disabled list July 6 with pain in his right
knee, and there's no telling when he'll return. In his absence, St.
Louis is 8-13.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's some uncertainty about Mark,'' Cardinals manager Tony
La Russa said. ''We think he's got a chance to come back, but in
the meantime Will Clark's a winning-type of veteran. He should help
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark was hitting .301 with nine homers and 28 RBIs in 79 games
with Baltimore. McGwire is batting .303 with 30 home runs and 69
RBIs in only 221 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew that our front office was really trying and that they
were catching some heat back home because some guys were going
other places,'' La Russa said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals filled another need, too. With catcher Eli Marrero
likely out until September with an injured left thumb, they got
Carlos Hernandez from San Diego for Heathcliff Slocumb. During the
weekend, St. Louis acquired Jason Christiansen and Mike Timlin for
the bullpen, making Slocumb expendable.
</P>
<P>
   The NL East-leading Braves, hoping for a return to the World
Series, got Surhoff and reliever Gabe Molina from the Orioles for
outfielder Trenidad Hubbard and two minor leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   Surhoff is batting .293 with 27 doubles, 13 homers and 57 RBIs.
He owns the longest consecutive games streak in the majors at 427.
</P>
<P>
   ''We felt like improving the offense of our ballclub, especially
in the outfield, was something we needed to do,'' Braves general
manager John Schuerholz said.
</P>
<P>
   Surhoff, also coveted by the Yankees, joined the Orioles for the
1996 season. Tears welled up in his eyes as he talked about the
trade.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just wouldn't have expected it to happen the way it
happened,'' he said. ''It's not that I don't want to play in

<P>
	   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - The Eastman Kodak Co. was in full effect
at the Republican National Convention.
</P>
<P>
   More than 30 delegates and their friends from Monroe County wore
bright red sport shirts at a pre-convention reception sponsored by
Kodak at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts.
</P>
<P>
   The shirts bore a county logo on the left breast and a slogan on
the left sleeve: ''We're leading New York.'' The garments were paid
for by Monroe County Republican Chairman Stephen J. Minarik III.
</P>
<P>
   For Kodak executives the wine and hors d'oeuvres in a fine art
gallery also amounted to a kind of marketing tool. Hundreds of New
Yorkers drifted in and out during the event.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're the largest manufacturing employer in New York state,''
said Kodak Chief Executive Officer Daniel Carp. ''These people have
to get to know me as a human being. It's my responsibility to my
employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Kodak officials did not say exactly how much they spent on the
affair. Carp brushed aside questions about Kodak buying influence
with political big shots.
</P>
<P>
   ''We compete on a world stage with the Japanese, with the
Europeans, all who have their mechanism of working with
government,'' he said. ''This gives me the chance to talk with
people I otherwise wouldn't meet.''

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP)-- Stocks opened mixed Tuesday as investors tried to
interpret conflicting signals about the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half hour of trading, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 5.63 at 10,529.33.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index fell 40.86 to 3,726.66. The Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 index was down 1.82 at 1,429,19.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign that the economy is still growing rapidly,
consumer spending posted a strong rebound in June after two months
of lackluster growth, the government said Tuesday. The Commerce
Department said spending rose by 0.5 percent in June, a slightly
better-than-expected gain.
</P>
<P>
   The rebound in spending outstripped American workers' gain in
incomes, which rose up 0.4 percent in June. That was in line with
analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The uptick in spending is good news for corporations that rely
on consumer demand but it could also intensify worries about
inflation and another possible interest rate hike by the Federal
Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, investors Tuesday were also reviewing another key
report-- the National Association of Purchasing Management
manufacturing index. The manufacturing report found growth in the
nation's industrial sector remained flat in July at 51.8 percent.
Analysts had expected a small increase.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Investigates Chinese Research  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- The federal government is investigating medical
research projects conducted in China by three Harvard-affiliated
institutions following a complaint that researchers failed to
protect study participants.
</P>
<P>
   The studies, which involved thousands of Chinese participants,
seek genetic and other causes for conditions including asthma,
obesity, miscarriage and schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   The Harvard School of Public Health, Brigham and Women's
Hospital in Boston and Massachusetts Mental Health Research Corp.
were named in the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Psychiatric epidemiologist Gwendolyn Zahner, formerly an
assistant professor at Harvard's school of public health, filed the
complaint with the federal Office for Protection from Research
Risks, which was recently revamped and renamed the Office for Human
Research Protection.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cheaper, larger and faster genetics studies are possible in
China only because the country has not yet established the legal,
environmental, workplace and medical protections afforded to
American citizens,'' Zahner wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The 15-page complaint, obtained by The Boston Globe, concerns a
dozen studies recently concluded or still under way in China, some
of which involve taking blood samples for DNA analysis, the
newspaper reported Tuesday. The government is currently looking
into five of the studies, said Robin Herman, a spokeswoman for the
Harvard school.
</P>
<P>
   In each case, the Harvard researchers worked with Chinese
collaborators, who carried out much of the work. Two studies were
funded by Millennium Pharmaceuticals of Cambridge, and the
remainder by the National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Zahner's complaint says some of the participants were
illiterate, and she questions whether they voluntarily consented,
were coerced by Chinese health officials or paid to participate.
The complaint also asks if DNA samples were obtained by local
officials, which could put the participants at risk of
discrimination or forced sterilization.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers and institutions defended their research
practices, saying participants were identified in the research by
code numbers, not names.
</P>
<P>
   ''No research was done without obtaining informed consent, and
no people were put in harm's way,'' said James Ware, dean for
academic affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Participants were not paid, but they were reimbursed for lost
wages, Herman said.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are all observational studies; this is not any kind of
treatment,'' she added. ''We're looking at large populations. We
can say nothing about the individual about what we're learning.''
</P>
<P>
   The government is still reviewing the institutions' responses,
months after they were submitted.
</P>
<P>
   At least one ethicist pointed up the potential problems of
conducting research in a country like China.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're all tied up in knots about the ethics of conducting
cross-national research, particularly between rich and poor
countries and those with poor human rights records,'' Ruth Faden,
executive director of the bioethics institute at Johns Hopkins
University, told the newspaper. ''Our current set of regulations
governing research on human subjects is inadequate.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Accuses GOP of Deception  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- From the sidelines in Florida, President
Clinton accused Republicans of using their convention in
Philadelphia to deceive the public. George W. Bush called him
desperate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Their strategy is to talk about compassion and all that, and
it's a brilliant strategy, a pretty package, and they're hoping if
they wrap it tight enough, nobody will open it before Christmas,''
Clinton said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   That followed his more personal remarks of last Friday, when he
said, ''Nearest I can tell, the message of the Bush campaign is
just that, 'How bad could I be? I've been governor of Texas, my
daddy was president, I own a baseball team. ...'''
</P>
<P>
   Bush had been ignoring the taunts, but when asked about
Clinton's comments Tuesday, he said:
</P>
<P>
   ''Good. You know something, I welcome President Clinton's
criticism. It's amazing to me that the president of the United
States would spend time trying to be a political pundit. He's so
desperate to have his legacy intact by getting Al Gore elected that
he'll say anything, just like Al Gore will.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, raising money in Florida for Senate candidates, said
Democrats must make sure voters focus on the implications of GOP
programs before the November election.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Fox Television he pursued the idea that
Republicans are blurring their record and exploiting ''a tendency
in this country to give the other crowd a chance after they've been
out for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   He called Bush ''charming'' and ''attractive'' and Dick Cheney,
his running mate, ''a very nice man.'' But he said of the
Republicans, ''It's like they're almost saying, we have a right to
obscure our record from the people.''
</P>
<P>
   He dismissed the prescription drug plan drafted by House
Republicans as ''a bunch of baloney'' that would help drug
companies, not the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   He portrayed Republican-proposed tax cuts as the
will-of-the-wisp day dreams of people who spend lottery winnings
before they actually win any money.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted that the Treasury Department will pay off $221
billion of federal debt this year and called that ''the largest
one-year debt pay-down in American history, a giant step toward
paying off the entire national debt by 2012.
</P>
<P>
   Republican-backed tax cuts would prevent the government from
achieving that goal, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president ripped Republican plans and policies on the
environment, on maintaining economic prosperity, on education,
crime, health care, civil rights and raising the minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now their strategy is to blur all that,'' Clinton said,
asserting that Republicans are using phrases like ''compassionate
conservatism'' to paper over the harshness of their programs.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're not bragging about shutting the government down twice
anymore, or trying to shut the Department of Education down, or
having the biggest Medicare and education and environmental cuts in
history,'' he said at the Palm Beach event. ''Gone is the harsh
rhetoric and mean words of 1992 through 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   He compared the Republican eagerness for tax cuts to
overindulgence in a cafeteria.
</P>
<P>
   ''Every time I go to a cafeteria, everything I see looks good,
but if I eat it all, I'll get sick,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Republicans appear bent on spending the entire
surplus, even if emergencies arise for which the money is needed.
</P>
<P>
   It's a lot like getting one of those letters in the mail, the
one that says ''you MAY have won $10 million'', the president said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But did you go out and spend that $10 million the next day?''
he asked. ''If you did you should support Republicans in this
election. But if you didn't, you better stick with us.''

<P>
   Singers Lee Ann Womack and Brad Paisley, along with the band
Lonestar, announced the nominations at a news conference at
Adelphia Coliseum. Winners will be announced Oct. 4 at a ceremony
at the Grand Ole Opry House, broadcast live by CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Hits by Paisley and Womack were positioned as potential big
winners. Womack's ''I Hope You Dance'' and Paisley's ''He Didn't
Have to Be'' were nominated in the best song, single and video
categories.
</P>
<P>
   Hill was nominated for the top award -- best entertainer -- along
with her husband, Tim McGraw; the Dixie Chicks; Alan Jackson; and
George Strait. Last year's winner, Shania Twain, was not nominated.
</P>
<P>
   Hill also was nominated for best female vocalist; vocal event of
the year for ''Let's Make Love,'' a duet with McGraw; and best
album, single and video, all for ''Breathe.'' She could win eight
awards because as a producer, she would get two awards if she wins
best album and single.
</P>
<P>
   Hot newcomer Paisley was nominated in six categories, including
best male vocalist with Jackson, Strait, McGraw and Vince Gill.
Paisley's other nominations were album of the year for ''Who Needs
Pictures'' and the Horizon award for career progress.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest surprise was ''Murder on Music Row.'' The song,
which criticizes the recent pop music direction that Nashville has
taken, got Jackson and Strait a nod for best vocal event. Writers
Larry Cordell and Larry Shell were nominated for best song.
</P>
<P>
   Nominated with Hill for best female vocalist were Martina
McBride, Jo Dee Messina, Womack and Trisha Yearwood.
</P>
<P>
   Joining ''I Hope You Dance,'' ''He Didn't Have to Be'' and
''Breathe'' in the best single category were ''How Do You Like Me
Now'' by Toby Keith and ''Buy Me a Rose'' by veteran Kenny Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   About 6,000 workers in the country music industry nominate and
vote for CMA winners. The awards began in 1967.

<HEADLINE> Cable Channel Aims at 'Fine Living'  </HEADLINE>
By DUNCAN MANSFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   KNOXVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Ah, the good life!
</P>
<P>
   What is it? Well, paradise comes in many forms.
</P>
<P>
   A 24-hour cable channel launching next year called Fine Living
promises to capture its rich, rare and relaxed essence. In other
words, upscale TV.
</P>
<P>
   Scripps Networks, a growing purveyor of lifestyles programming
including Home &AMP; Garden Television and the Food Network, has
dreamed up Fine Living.
</P>
<P>
   What exactly will be on the new channel hasn't been decided --
more focus groups are scheduled across the country next month.
Scripps is somewhere between an idea and a product at this point.
</P>
<P>
   But if it were a magazine, Fine Living probably would be closer
to Town &AMP; Country than HGTV-like Good Housekeeping. Magazines, in
fact, were part of the inspiration -- publications like The Robb
Report, Wine Spectator and Cigar Aficionado.
</P>
<P>
   ''We did some research to tell us if we are crazy or on the mark
in terms of concept,'' said Susan Packard, president of Scripps'
New Ventures division, adding that Scripps liked the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Never has there been a moment in history where we have seen so
much disposable income and yet so little disposable time ... to
enjoy the fruits of our labor,'' Packard said.
</P>
<P>
   Fine Living will be aimed at satisfying ''the needs of these
very time-starved people by providing the best of the best in a
number of categories.''
</P>
<P>
   The channel will key on five main topics: dining (fine cuisine
and spirits), personal transportation (luxury cars, yachts and
jets), homes (mansions, ski chalets, antiques), travel (exotic
getaways, five-star hotels) and personal finance (estate planning,
charitable giving).
</P>
<P>
   ''What you are trying to do is grab a demographic that is
high-end,'' said analyst Derek Baine at Paul Kagan Associates. ''It
is just a question of how big is that market and how much
competition are they going to have from the 'Lifestyles of the Rich
and Famous' and some of those programs on E!''
</P>
<P>
   Baine guesses Fine Living will find an audience, and could even
leverage its cache if it manages a joint venture later with some of
these upscale magazines it emulates.
</P>
<P>
   Scripps Networks is drawing from the lessons learned with HGTV,
which tapped the do-it-yourself audience of home remodelers,
crafters and hobbyists so effectively when it launched in late
1994. Today, HGTV reaches 62 million homes and gets 14 million hits
a month on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Lowe, who founded HGTV and is now president and chief
operating officer of parent company E.W. Scripps, said Fine Living
is a logical next step.
</P>
<P>
   He compares it to Home Depot's expansion into EXPO Design
Centers, home improvement stores in which stoves are commercial
grade and lighting fixtures can cost thousands.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is a smaller audience but it is an audience that is growing
out of the basic Depot story,'' Lowe said.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, he said, Fine Living is ''just an extension both
economically and taste-wise of the folks who are maybe Home &AMP;
Garden or Food viewers ... and certainly those folks who are
already there.''
</P>
<P>
   Scripps will be targeting households in the $75,000 and up
income brackets. Programming will focus on ''professional men and
women who are adventurous, active, focused on quality and service,
and tech-savvy,'' the network says.
</P>
<P>
   Though a smaller audience, it could still represent tens of
millions of potential viewers, the network says. And they could
lure advertisers who are trying to reach them now primarily through
print media.
</P>
<P>
   ''The future is about continuing to define passionate audience
segments that have sizable advertising and commerce attached to
them, and this is certainly one that we think has not been
tapped,'' Lowe said.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'Hollow Man'  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   The screenplay is almost as transparent as star Kevin Bacon, but
let's not kid ourselves. You're not going to see ''Hollow Man'' to
hear this invisible guy speak.
</P>
<P>
   You're going for the full dose of the remarkable visual wizardry
in the movie's ads, chillingly showing Bacon vanish from skin to
bone.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hollow Man,'' the latest sci-fi blood bath from director Paul
Verhoeven (''Starship Troopers,'' ''RoboCop''), is driven purely by
its visceral special effects.
</P>
<P>
   The plot is your basic
invisibility-sends-narcissist-scientist-into-ego-overdrive story,
with the cliched ex-lover (Elisabeth Shue) working alongside him
despite their rocky romantic history.
</P>
<P>
   The dialogue and characters are largely incidental, except for
the Invisible Mr. Bacon, represented for much of the movie by a
digitized stand-in depicting the actor as a smoky phantom or a
gruesome, skinless ghoul.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, a brilliant, vainglorious
researcher who has discovered the secret of invisibility for a
military project and makes himself the first human guinea pig.
Trouble is, while Caine has found an antidote that restores
invisible lab animals, the counteragent doesn't work on people.
</P>
<P>
   So he's stuck in limbo, confined to an underground research
bunker except for a couple of nasty voyeuristic jaunts around
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Delusions of godhood overwhelm him. Caine mutinies against his
fellow researchers, waging a war of attrition to eradicate anyone
with knowledge of the invisible man. Then he'll be free to do as he
pleases, rampaging through a world ignorant of his presence.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the script's few perceptive lines, Caine proclaims,
''It's amazing what you can do when you don't have to look at
yourself in the mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   Everything else is pretty much doggerel. There are vapid
exchanges among the scientists, bland repartee between Caine and
former lover Linda McKay (Shue), and a cookie-cutter romantic
triangle involving her new boyfriend (Josh Brolin).
</P>
<P>
   ''You want to know what it's like to make love to an invisible
man?'' Caine asks his ex.
</P>
<P>
   ''It would be like old times,'' McKay responds. ''You were never
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Strange they couldn't make a go of it, with wit like that to
prop up their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The mad-scientist story line is essentially the same as H.G.
Wells' ''The Invisible Man'' and the 1933 Claude Rains classic,
adapted from the novel by director James Whale. But oh, how far
Hollywood has come from objects floating in the air and Rains
swathed in bandages.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon spent much of his time on set painted green, blue or black
so he could be matted out later, with phantom glimpses of the
invisible Caine inserted digitally, based on computer imaging of
the actor.
</P>
<P>
   Visions of Caine covered in water, mist and blood are striking.
The images of Caine vanishing and partly reappearing -- along with
the similar rematerialization of an invisible gorilla -- absolutely
dazzle.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hollow Man'' plays out much like a haunted-house story, with
all the requisite oversights by the victims. The supposedly
brilliant researchers prove themselves as dumb as fence posts when
it comes to practical matters, such as wandering the labyrinthine
bunker alone while their invisible foe stalks them, or repeatedly
failing to make sure Caine is dead when they manage to get the
better of him.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, McKay says, ''The concept of Sebastian is much
more appealing than Sebastian himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Ditto with ''Hollow Man.'' The invisibility idea was ripe for a
retread, but the movie ambles shallowly in Whale's wake, bringing
little new to the concept other than visual fireworks.
</P>
<P>
   But again, no one's going to ''Hollow Man'' for its brains.
They're going to see an invisible maniac on the prowl. In that
regard, Verhoeven and company deliver with bombastic aplomb.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hollow Man,'' distributed by Sony's Columbia Pictures, runs
114 minutes and is rated R, with loads of very visible violence.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'Space Cowboys'  </HEADLINE>
By BOB THOMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
	   If John Glenn can journey into space at age 77, why not Clint
Eastwood, 70, Tommy Lee Jones, 53, Donald Sutherland, 66, and James
Garner, 72?
</P>
<P>
	   Why not, indeed? While the quartet may seem creaky, they do
heroic work in ''Space Cowboys,'' directed and produced by
Eastwood.
</P>
<P>
	   Movies may be a youth market these days, but there's great fun
in watching these accomplished pros do what they do best, which is
to breathe life, humor and strength into their roles.
</P>
<P>
	   You might ask why in heaven's name NASA would send up four
over-the-hill astronauts on a near-impossible mission? (They are
accompanied by a couple of scornful youngsters, Loren Dean and
Courtney B. Vance, but their roles are subordinate.)
</P>
<P>
	   The premise, as written by Ken Kaufman and Howard Klausner, is
semi-convincing. In the late 1950s, the four were hot-dog test
pilots selected to be Team Daedalus, named after the wing-builder
of Greek mythology. They were to be the first pioneers in space.
</P>
<P>
	   Perhaps because the pilots were such free spirits, the
government disbanded Team Daedalus and sent a monkey on their
mission. A blander set of astronauts was chosen for the first space
flights.
</P>
<P>
	   Forty years later, NASA faces a crisis: A Russian satellite is
failing and its loss might destroy communications in Russia. A NASA
bureaucrat, played by James Cromwell, proposes a desperate
solution: Send up Team Daedalus to attempt repair of the satellite.
</P>
<P>
	   ''Space Cowboys'' starts slowly, necessarily so. The four fliers
are depicted in their prime, using younger actors in shadowy
black-and-white, with the stars' voices. Then they are shown in
present-day: Eastwood retired and embittered; Jones a crop-duster
and stunt daredevil; Sutherland an engineer of rollercoasters;
Garner a rural preacher. Eastwood manages to inject action into the
sequences.
</P>
<P>
	   Tension builds at NASA, where Eastwood and Cromwell have been
enemies since Cromwell pulled the plug on Daedalus 40 years before
(amazingly, he's still working for NASA). The mission director,
William Devane, scorns the oldsters, as do the current astronauts.
Somehow, the four get through the physical training.
</P>
<P>
	   When the revived Team Daedalus blasts off, the real drama
begins. If you think Apollo 13 had a problem, you ain't seen
nothing yet.
</P>
<P>
	   As always, Eastwood directs with a firm hand. The action scenes,
partly filmed at the Houston and Orlando space centers with a huge
boost from Industrial Light and Magic, are riveting. Director
Eastwood doesn't neglect his own performance: His taciturn,
skeptical character remains a cinema classic.
</P>
<P>
	   The four actors work in perfect harmony: Eastwood the leader;
Jones the fearless adventurer; Sutherland the wise, sardonic
problem solver; Garner the stabilizing force. Marcia Gay Harden has
some moments as a NASA official with a fondness for Jones. But it's
a man's movie, and most of the other female characters are limited
to watching with concerned looks.
</P>
<P>
	   The Warner Bros. release was produced by Eastwood and Andrew
Lazar. Rated PG-13, mostly for mild swearing and tense action.
Running time: 130 minutes.

<HEADLINE> At the Movies: 'The Tao of Steve'  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID GERMAIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're looking for love, ''The Tao of Steve'' presents a
blithe cinematic how-to, spelling out the do's, don'ts and maybes
for successful courtship.
</P>
<P>
   Captured with great heart and humor, this refreshing romantic
comedy is highlighted by winning performances from Donal Logue as
an overweight, underachieving lady-killer and Greer Goodman as the
woman who spells femme fatale for his lecherous ways.
</P>
<P>
   On its surface, the movie is a fairly predictable
boy-remeets-girl story as Dex (Logue) woos Syd (Goodman), a
forgotten woman from his torrid Casanova-on-campus days in Santa
Fe, N.M., a decade earlier.
</P>
<P>
   What elevates ''The Tao of Steve'' is the smart, mirthful
screenplay co-written by Goodman, her sister and the film's
director, Jenniphr, and their friend Duncan North, whose way with
women was the basis for the script.
</P>
<P>
   The writers insightfully explore dating stereotypes, sexual
posturing and the expectations men and women bring to
relationships. They create a tight little band of romance warriors,
with the ensemble cast depicting disdainful women, haplessly
heartsick men, couples in bliss and marriages on the brink. A third
Goodman sister, Dana, co-stars as a bartender seduced by Dex.
</P>
<P>
   The most important thing in Dex's life is the steady lineup of
women he manages to bed, despite his girth, his slacker lifestyle
and his propensity to smoke pot for breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   In a nutshell, the tao Dex preaches is the image of the remote,
unfathomable male, a James Dean, a James Bond, the sort who ''never
tries to impress women but always gets the girl.'' The ultimate
progenitor of the tao, in his mind, is the icy cool Steve McQueen.
</P>
<P>
   The tao's three key rules: Eliminate your desire, because a
woman will sense it; display excellence in her presence; then
retreat.
</P>
<P>
   ''The basic rule is, we pursue that which retreats from us,''
Dex instructs a tao protege.
</P>
<P>
   Follow these precepts, Dex lectures, and women will capitulate.
</P>
<P>
   It's a gussied-up variation of the schoolyard
playing-hard-to-get approach. But to a degree, the tao of Steve
articulates the sort of guile the most noble of lovers may have
stooped to, posing as something else for fear a new partner will
find fault with the real person.
</P>
<P>
   The perceptive Syd slices through Dex's facade, shaking him and
the tao to their core with an observation about that greatest of
heartbreakers, Don Juan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Don Giovanni slept with thousands of women because he was
afraid he wouldn't be loved by one,'' Syd tells Dex.
</P>
<P>
   Smitten with Syd, Dex halfheartedly continues to trumpet the tao
of Steve while gradually violating its rules. He is unable to
eliminate his desire, telling Syd flat out that he's falling in
love with her. Dex does do excellent things in her presence, though
not the calculated actions the tao requires but gestures from his
ordinary life, such as an endearing encounter with children he
teaches as a part-time kindergarten instructor.
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, it is Syd who retreats and Dex who must decide
whether to pursue or lapse back into wanton ways.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been trying to turn you into me,'' Dex tells one of his
tao disciples, ''and I'm not even sure I want to be me anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Logue received a well-deserved special acting award for ''The
Tao of Steve'' at last winter's Sundance Film Festival. The movie
gave Logue his first chance to carry a film after years of smaller
parts in ''The Patriot,'' ''Runaway Bride'' and ''Blade.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides proving Logue can handle a lead role, ''The Tao of
Steve'' marks an excellent filmmaking debut for Jenniphr and Greer
Goodman, who plan to collaborate on future movies. Look forward to
the next chapter in the Goodmans' tao.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Tao of Steve,'' released by Sony Pictures Classics, runs
90 minutes and is rated R for language and some drug use.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 21; Nasdaq Falls 36  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed Tuesday as investors mulled
conflicting signals about the U.S. economy. Technology stocks fell
on profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
   At midday on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was
up 20.88 at 10,543.37.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index was down 36.22 at 3,730.77, giving
back more than a third of its 103.99-point advance on Monday. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 3.21 at 1,434.04.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign that the economy is continuing its rapid growth,
consumer spending posted a strong rebound in June after two
lackluster months, the government said Tuesday. The Commerce
Department said spending rose by 0.5 percent in June, a slightly
better-than-expected gain.
</P>
<P>
   The rebound in spending outstripped American workers' gain in
incomes, which rose 0.4 percent in June. That was in line with
analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The uptick in spending is good news for corporations that rely
on consumer demand but it could also intensify worries about
inflation and another possible interest rate hike by the Federal
Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, investors Tuesday were also reviewing a report from
the National Association of Purchasing Management that activity in
the nation's industrial sector was unchanged in July. Analysts had
expected a small increase.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Dow with its economy-sensitive stocks is getting
encouragement from the purchasing management report that shows the
economy is slowing to healthy levels,'' said Alfred E. Goldman,
director of market analysis, A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc., St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing the Dow higher was Disney, up $1.25 to $39.938 and Merck
&AMP; Co. up $1.25 to $72.50.
</P>
<P>
   Internet and telecommunications stocks pulled the Nasdaq lower.
Among them were Cisco, off $1.50 at $64, and Worldcom, down $1.125
at $37.938. But Amazon.com, showed some legs after sustaining a
steep decline last month, adding $1 to $31.125,
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 439.24 million
shares, up from Monday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 1.17 to 499.54.

<HEADLINE> EU: US Can't Rule Out Mad Cow  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL AMES
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Cases of mad cow disease are unlikely
to occur in the United States and Canada but cannot be ruled out,
according to a European Union report released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The report studied the risks of the cattle ailment -- bovine
spongiform encephalopathy, or BSE -- spreading beyond the nine
European nations with confirmed cases.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is still unlikely, but cannot be excluded that BSE is
present in the USA and Canada,'' said a European Union statement on
the report by a team of European scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union's Scientific Steering Committee found that
mad cow disease ''is uncertain, but likely'' in Italy, Spain and
Germany, where no domestic cases have been found.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists based their analysis on patterns of live cattle
and cattle-feed exports from Britain during the 1980s and 1990s
when British herds were hit by an epidemic of the disease blamed on
the use of cattle feed that included ground animal remains.
</P>
<P>
   The fatal cattle ailment has been linked to a similar
brain-wasting illness in humans, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, which
has killed about 50 people in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Since the British outbreak, which affected some 180,000 cattle,
about 200 cases have been found in Portugal and smaller numbers in
Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, France, Denmark and,
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union study covered 23 nations. It concluded the
occurrence of mad cow disease was ''highly unlikely'' in the non-EU
members Australia, Chile, New Zealand, Norway, New Zealand,
Argentina and Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
   However, the experts included United States and Canada with EU
members Austria, Finland and Sweden, where the presence of infected
cattle was unlikely but not excluded.
</P>
<P>
   ''These countries are probably free of BSE -- but individual BSE
cases may nevertheless occur in the future,'' the report said.
''However the development of an epidemic is not likely.''
</P>
<P>
   The report said there was a risk infected livestock imported
from Britain may have been used in cattle feed in the United States
before the introduction of tighter safeguards during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is among several nations with bans on British
beef since the early or mid 1990s. The 15-nation European Union
dropped a worldwide prohibition of British beef exports last year,
after London introduced safety measures.
</P>
<P>
   The EU said separately it was investigating reports that a new
BSE-type disease has been detected in sheep in Vermont. U.S.
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman on July 14 ordered the slaughter
of 376 sheep originating from Belgium on suspicion that they may
have a mad cow-type disease.

<HEADLINE> Film Festival Showcases Minorities  </HEADLINE>
By NEKESA MUMBI MOODY
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Chi Moui Lo's film debut, ''Catfish in Black
Bean Sauce,'' centers on two young Vietnamese refugees who come to
America and end up being adopted by a black family. Suffice to say,
it's not mainstream Hollywood fare.
</P>
<P>
   Lo had difficulty getting a studio to finance the film, which
cost $2 million to make and stars Paul Winfield, ''Love and
Basketball's'' Sanaa Lathan, ''The Joy Luck Club's'' Lauren Tom,
and the filmmaker himself.
</P>
<P>
   ''The studios basically hinted that the problem with the film
was too many minorities, too many old people,'' said Lo, who has
appeared on shows such as ''NYPD Blue.'' ''They said, 'Your movie
is a minority of a minority of a minority.'''
</P>
<P>
   While the film has not been embraced by major Hollywood studios,
it has found an audience -- at this year's Urbanworld Film Festival.
Now in its fourth year, the New York-based event has become a key
venue for minority filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The festival, which opens Wednesday, features approximately 70
films ranging from short independent flicks to big-budget,
high-profile releases. Among the films that have premiered at
Urbanworld are last year's hit ''The Best Man.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Here's an opportunity for your film as a filmmaker of color to
get seen and to have audiences understand it and to relate to it
and to connect to it,'' said Malcolm Lee, director of ''The Best
Man.'' ''A lot of other film festivals don't always offer that, an
opportunity to be lauded as such.''
</P>
<P>
   Most films entered at Urbanworld must either be made by a black
person or be about black people. However, there are opportunities
for other minorities to show their work -- eight Hispanic filmmakers
and eight Asian filmmakers will have their projects shown this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Urbanworld was launched in 1997 by 32-year-old Stacy Spikes, a
former marketing executive at Miramax Films and October Films.
Spikes saw how few opportunities there were for minority filmmakers
to display their talents, especially at other film festivals, even
those designed to focus on non-mainstream films.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel there is a lot more black content that should be shown
at those festivals that are shown,'' he said. ''But they are doing
us a favor. If they were doing such a great job, Urbanworld
wouldn't exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee credits the festival for helping ''The Best Man'' debut at
No. 1 at the box office last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a very good platform for us in that it got the word of
mouth going early, that was about two months before we opened,'' he
said. ''A lot of people sent e-mails out regarding the film after
Urbanworld.''
</P>
<P>
   In many respects, Urbanworld's success is representative of the
strides made in black film over the past two decades. Films like
''Soul Food,'' ''Waiting to Exhale'' and ''How Stella Got Her
Groove Back'' have proved profitable and demonstrated that there is
an audience willing to plunk down money to see blacks in starring
roles.
</P>
<P>
   And blacks are having more success behind the camera as well.
One of the summer's biggest hits, ''Scary Movie,'' was directed by
Keenan Ivory Wayans, and co-written by two of his brothers, Shawn
and Marlon.
</P>
<P>
   Wayans remembers how few black films were being made when he
helped write Robert Townsend's 1987 film ''Hollywood Shuffle,''
which he also starred in. Along with Spike Lee's ''She's Gotta Have
It,'' those films ushered in a new era in black filmmaking, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you look at all the people who are here now just in that
short period of time, it's definitely had a positive impact, and we
can see growth,'' he said. ''It's just a matter of now going to the
next level, which is not being perceived just as black filmmakers,
and just being filmmakers.''
</P>
<P>
   Other minority filmmakers are hoping for the same thing. Lo's
''Catfish'' opens nationwide Aug. 25 in 40 markets, and despite its
minority theme, Lo considers the film mainstream.
</P>
<P>
   ''My story is about mother and child, family relationships,'' he
said. ''I think for decades we have been seeing films about mother
and child through a white perspective. And in my film, I think we
get to see it through an African-American and Asian perspective ...
and it's universal.''

<HEADLINE> Hill, Paisley Lead CMA Nominations  </HEADLINE>
By JIM PATTERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- Faith Hill received eight nominations
Tuesday for Country Music Association awards, while Nashville
showed a willingness to criticize itself by nominating the song
''Murder on Music Row'' twice.
</P>
<P>
   Singers Lee Ann Womack and Brad Paisley, along with the band
Lonestar, announced the nominations at a news conference at
Adelphia Coliseum. Winners will be announced Oct. 4 at a ceremony
at the Grand Ole Opry House, broadcast live by CBS.
</P>
<P>
   Hits by Paisley and Womack were positioned as potential big
winners. Womack's ''I Hope You Dance'' and Paisley's ''He Didn't
Have to Be'' were nominated in the best song, single and video
categories.
</P>
<P>
   ''It feels really good,'' Womack said. ''Even with such a great
song, you never know what's going to happen. I've heard great songs
before that didn't sell the records or get radio airplay or get
awards nominations.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill was nominated for the top award -- best entertainer -- along
with her husband, Tim McGraw; the Dixie Chicks; Alan Jackson; and
George Strait. Last year's winner, Shania Twain, was not nominated.
</P>
<P>
   Hill also was nominated for best female vocalist; vocal event of
the year for ''Let's Make Love,'' a duet with McGraw; and best
album, single and video, all for ''Breathe.'' She could win eight
awards because as a producer, she would get two awards if she wins
best album and single.
</P>
<P>
   Hot newcomer Paisley was nominated in six categories, including
best male vocalist with Jackson, Strait, McGraw and Vince Gill.
Paisley's other nominations were album of the year for ''Who Needs
Pictures'' and the Horizon award for career progress.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't feel worthy, but I'm honored,'' Paisley said. ''Folks
must feel like I'm on the right track.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest surprise was ''Murder on Music Row.'' The song,
which criticizes the recent pop music direction that Nashville has
taken, got Jackson and Strait a nod for best vocal event. Writers
Larry Cordell and Larry Shell were nominated for best song.
</P>
<P>
   ''That song hit the nail on the head,'' Paisley said. ''There is
so much glamour going on in Nashville that it felt good to hear a
song come out and flat-out say, 'Look, let's not lose the heart.'''
</P>
<P>
   Nominated with Hill for best female vocalist were Martina
McBride, Jo Dee Messina, Womack and Trisha Yearwood.
</P>
<P>
   Joining ''I Hope You Dance,'' ''He Didn't Have to Be'' and
''Breathe'' in the best single category were ''How Do You Like Me
Now'' by Toby Keith and ''Buy Me a Rose'' by veteran Kenny Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   About 6,000 workers in the country music industry nominate and
vote for CMA winners. The awards began in 1967.

<HEADLINE> Cancer Drug, Gene Therapy Promising  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A combination of gene therapy and drugs is
showing promise in treating head and neck cancers, researchers in
Texas report.
</P>
<P>
   If borne out in further trials, the findings could point the way
to more effective treatment of almost 500,000 people who suffer
head and neck cancers annually.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at the M.D. Anderson Cancer Clinic in Houston report
that the combination therapy caused tumors to shrink in 25 of 30
patients tested. Their findings are reported in the August issue of
the journal Nature Medicine, published Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cancerous tumors, some as large as 2&AMP;frac12; inches, disappeared in
eight patients, the scientists reported. In others, the tumors
shrank by up to half.
</P>
<P>
   The positive findings are reported as gene therapy has come
under close scrutiny after the death of a patient undergoing
experimental treatment last September.
</P>
<P>
   The field has been criticized for too much hype and two few
successes, said W. French Anderson of the University of Southern
California, who was not involved in the newly reported research.
</P>
<P>
   But, Anderson added in an article accompanying the new paper,
''Gene therapy seems to be turning the corner after a very bad
year.''
</P>
<P>
   In the new paper, a team led by the Houston clinic's Fadlo Khuri
used a specially engineered virus called ONYX-015, which destroys
cells with a mutated tumor suppressor gene called p53. That mutated
gene occurs in up to 70 percent of head and neck tumors, the
scientists noted. ONYX-015 does not damage normal cells.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the gene therapy, the team added the traditional
chemotherapy drugs, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil, in patients with
recurrent squamous cell cancer of the head and neck. These cancers
are often associated with the use of tobacco and alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   They reported that ONYX-015 in combination with chemotherapy is
more effective than either treatment alone.
</P>
<P>
   Current chemotherapy produces results in only 30 percent to 40
percent of patients, and tumors often recur. By comparison, none of
the responding tumors treated with the combination therapy had
reappeared after six months.
</P>
<P>
   In the trial, the ONYX-015 was injected directly into the
tumors. The scientists suggested that future trials look into other
methods of administration and the possibility of using the gene
therapy in combination with other methods of treatment, including
radiation and surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Khuri, scientists participating in the research
represented U.S. Oncology, Dallas; the University of Glasgow,
Scotland; Royal Marsden Hospital and the Imperial Cancer Research
Fund, both in London; Western General Hospital, Edinburgh,
Scotland; Princess Margaret Hospital, Toronto; and ONYX
Pharmaceutical, Richmond, Calif.

<HEADLINE> ABC Report News Disputed  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- An environmental watchdog group called for the
firing of ABC News correspondent John Stossel, who in a report
called organic food no safer than regular food and warned it could
even be dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Stossel's report, first aired on the newsmagazine ''20/20'' in
February, seemed in part to debunk the common belief that organic
food is safer because no pesticides are used.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our tests surprisingly found no pesticide residue on the
conventional samples or the organic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Washington-based Environmental Working Group charges
that pesticide tests were never conducted for the show.
</P>
<P>
   The group says it has complained to ABC News president David
Westin as well as Stossel.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the report was repeated on a July 7 edition of
''20/20.'' On that broadcast, Stossel reiterated his point in a
comment to anchor Cynthia McFadden: ''It's logical to worry about
pesticide residues, but in our tests, we found none on either
organic or regular produce.''
</P>
<P>
   Stossel has won a wide following on ABC with his contrarian
approach to hot-button issues, taking on such things as government
regulation and defendants who claim to be victims. The segment's
producer, David Fitzpatrick, is traveling in Africa and unavailable
for comment. The network said neither he nor Stossel would comment
until the matter could be looked into.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're asking everyone involved to reserve comment until we've
looked at the files and spoken directly to the producer,'' said ABC
News spokeswoman Sonya McNair. ''If a mistake has been made, we
will correct it.''
</P>
<P>
   The group said scientists working for the show did test produce
for bacteria, but not for pesticides. It said chicken was tested
for pesticides, and traces were found on the regular poultry but
not on the organic poultry. This finding favorable to the organic
food proponents was not mentioned on the show, the group said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 78; Nasdaq Slips 34  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed Tuesday as investors mulled
conflicting signals about the U.S. economy. Technology stocks fell
on profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
   At midafternoon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average
was up 78.20 at 10,599.37.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index was down 33.98 at 3,733.01, giving
back nearly a third of its 103.99-point advance on Monday. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 9.61 at 1,440.44.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign that the economy is continuing its rapid growth,
consumer spending posted a strong rebound in June after two
lackluster months, the government said Tuesday. The Commerce
Department said spending rose by 0.5 percent in June, a slightly
better-than-expected gain.
</P>
<P>
   The rebound in spending outstripped American workers' gain in
incomes, which rose 0.4 percent in June. That was in line with
analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The uptick in spending is good news for corporations that rely
on consumer demand but it could also intensify worries about
inflation and another possible interest rate hike by the Federal
Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   In yet another sign of an economic slowdown, construction
spending fell 1.7 percent in June, a government report said.
Analysts expected a small increase.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, investors Tuesday were also reviewing a report from
the National Association of Purchasing Management that activity in
the nation's industrial sector was unchanged in July. Analysts had
expected a small increase.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Dow with its economy-sensitive stocks is getting
encouragement from the purchasing management report that shows the
economy is slowing to healthy levels,'' said Alfred E. Goldman,
director of market analysis, A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc., St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing the Dow higher was Disney, up $1.50 to $40.125 and Merck
&AMP; Co. up $2 to $73.625.
</P>
<P>
   Internet and telecommunications stocks pulled the Nasdaq lower.
Among them were Cisco, off $1.25 at $63.75, and Worldcom, down
$1.125 at $37.938.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 585.24 million
shares, up from Monday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 1.20 to 499.44.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Blast Kills Two  </HEADLINE>
By GEOFF SPENCER
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- The Philippine ambassador narrowly
escaped assassination Tuesday when a bomb blew apart his car.
Indonesia's president blamed Philippine Muslim separatists for the
attack, which killed two people and injured at least 22.
</P>
<P>
   The Philippines' largest Islamic rebel group quickly denied
responsibility for the blast, which scattered shrapnel and debris
for hundreds of yards in a neighborhood of diplomatic residences
and government offices just a block from the homes of the U.S.
ambassador and Indonesia's vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said some victims were mutilated by the explosion, and
some bloodied survivors walked around in a daze before emergency
crews arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Philippine Ambassador Leonides Caday was conscious but bleeding
profusely when passers-by pulled him from the back seat of his
Mercedes. He was taken to a hospital in the back of a truck. His
chauffeur was in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's President Abdurrahman Wahid was quick to pin the
attack on a Muslim insurgency in the southern Philippines and not
ethnic and separatist violence or political turmoil in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is related to the problems in the southern Philippines,''
said Wahid, who denied it was linked to security fears ahead of a
potentially stormy meeting of Indonesia's supreme legislative
assembly next week.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian military officers have recently accused Philippine
Muslim groups of supplying weapons to Islamic militias fighting
Christians in Indonesia's eastern Maluku islands. Thousands have
died in sectarian clashes there during the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, 17 Christians and two Muslims were killed in clashes
in the island group, also known as the Moluccas, 1,500 miles east
of Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   Police said an embassy guard and a woman street vendor died in
Tuesday's bombing in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the ambassador and his chauffeur, at least 20 others
were injured, said officials at the state-run Cipto Mangukusumo
Hospital. Four were in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   The Philippines Embassy said the ambassador sustained head, hand
and leg injuries, but was ''out of danger.'' Hospital officials
said he underwent surgery for his wounds.
</P>
<P>
   The ambassador's residence was badly damaged along with
neighboring homes of other diplomats and government offices.
</P>
<P>
   Some witnesses said the explosion came from the envoy's Mercedes
and blew it apart as it turned into the entrance of his residence
on Imam Bonjol Street.
</P>
<P>
   However, police investigators theorized that another car parked
near the entrance might have contained the bomb, which was
detonated as the Mercedes pulled into the driveway.
</P>
<P>
   In Manila, the Philippine government ordered all its embassies
to be placed on high alert.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Aguirre, President Joseph Estrada's national security
adviser, said it is the first time a Philippine diplomatic post had
been bombed. ''We didn't expect that to happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Philippines' largest secessionist group, the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front, denied it was behind the attack even though it is
accused of carrying out a series of bombings recently at home,
including two at shopping malls in Manila.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Escobar, the leader of Abu Sayyaf, another Muslim rebel
group accused of bombings, said some Indonesians supported the
Islamic secessionist movement in the mainly Roman Catholic
Philippines. His group has made international headlines by holding
29 hostages, including 15 foreign tourists, on a remote Philippine
island.

<HEADLINE> New Focus on Iraq's Standing  </HEADLINE>
By LEON BARKHO
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- Its invasion of Kuwait touched off a war
that left Iraq defeated and devastated and reduced a decade later
to a nation of children begging on street corners and families
relying on rations.
</P>
<P>
   The arrival of a senior U.N. official Tuesday focused new
attention on where this once-rich oil dynamo stands on the 10th
anniversary of its invasion and the imposition of U.N. sanctions to
punish it for the aggression
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. sanctions, which forbid trade with Iraq, are to remain
in place until U.N. weapons inspectors certify that Iraq's
biological, chemical and nuclear weapons and the missiles used to
deliver them have been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Without trade, the Iraqi economy has been crippled. But
President Saddam Hussein, the architect of the Kuwaiti invasion,
remains firmly in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, attention is focusing not on what he did 10 years
ago, but on how ordinary Iraqis are suffering today.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's arrival of Benon Sevan, executive director of the U.N.
Office for the Iraq Program, comes at a critical stage for Iraq,
still locked in a standoff with the U.N. Security Council over
weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. weapons inspectors left Iraq shortly before the United
States and Britain began airstrikes in December 1998 meant to
punish Iraq for a lack of cooperation with the inspectors. The
Iraqi government has barred U.N. inspectors from returning.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq does not hide its resentment of the oil-for-food program
Sevan oversees, which places all Baghdad's dealings with the
outside world under strict scrutiny. Proceeds from oil sales under
the program, which are expected to top $10 billion in the current
six-month phase, go directly to a U.N. escrow account and are only
spent to pay for approved purchases to offset the impact of
sanctions on ordinary Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
   Cabinet ministers have frequently charged that the Iraqi people
are the last to benefit from the program, while U.N. agencies
involved in running it are the first to take advantage of it.
</P>
<P>
   More than 600 international staff work under Sevan, whose
expenses Iraq claims consume up to 4 percent of oil revenues
expected to hit $18 billion this year if oil prices hold. Some 30
percent goes to a U.N. fund to compensate victims of Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   But in a statement on Monday, Sevan lauded the program, saying
it has made the ''situation for many (in Iraq) significantly
better.''
</P>
<P>
   He called the U.N.-monitored oil deal ''by far the largest
humanitarian program ever administered by the United Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan recently approved $7.1 billion
in spending under the program's present leg, which runs from June
to December.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Sevan nor his aides in Baghdad would disclose the agenda
of the current visit. But besides Iraqi complaints, Sevan is
expected to raise issues about the security of his staff.
</P>
<P>
   In late June, two U.N. staffers were killed when a gunman
stormed the headquarters of the U.N. Food and Agriculture
Organization in Baghdad. The authorities did not even condemn the
killing. Instead they seized on it, allowing the gunman to address
a news conference during which he said he acted because of concern
about the plight of his country under sanctions.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Dow Adds 52; Nasdaq Drops 60  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed Tuesday as investors mulled
conflicting signals about the U.S. economy. Technology stocks fell
on profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
   In late afternoon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial
average was up 51.72 at 10,573.34.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index was down 60.33 at 3,706.69, giving
back nearly two-thirds of its 103.99-point advance on Monday. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 6.75 at 1,437.58.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign that the economy is continuing its rapid growth,
consumer spending posted a strong rebound in June after two
lackluster months, the government said Tuesday. The Commerce
Department said spending rose by 0.5 percent in June, a slightly
better than expected gain.
</P>
<P>
   The rebound in spending outstripped American workers' gain in
incomes, which rose 0.4 percent in June. That was in line with
analysts' expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The uptick in spending is good news for corporations that rely
on consumer demand but it could also intensify worries about
inflation and another possible interest rate hike by the Federal
Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   But in another sign of an economic slowdown, construction
spending fell 1.7 percent in June, the Commerce Department said.
Analysts expected a small increase.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, investors Tuesday were also reviewing a report from
the National Association of Purchasing Management that activity in
the nation's industrial sector was unchanged in July. Analysts had
expected a small increase.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Dow with its economy-sensitive stocks is getting
encouragement from the purchasing management report that shows the
economy is slowing to healthy levels,'' said Alfred E. Goldman,
director of market analysis, A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons Inc., St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Pushing the Dow higher was Disney, up $1.50 to $40.125 and
Coca-Cola, bubbling up 2.688 to $64.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of utilies, pharmaceuticals and petroleum equipment
makers were generally up.
</P>
<P>
   Internet and telecommunications stocks pulled the Nasdaq lower.
Among them were Cisco, off $1.50 at $63.25, and Worldcom, down $1
at $38.06.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 707.56 million
shares, up from Monday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 1.25 to 499.39.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe White Taking Farmers' Land  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- In a massive, racially tinged land
seizure, Zimbabwe's government has confirmed plans to take more
than half of all the white-owned farming land in the country
without paying for it and redistribute it to 500,000 black
families.
</P>
<P>
   The government had already said it would confiscate 804 farms
from Zimbabwe's white minority. But in a statement late Monday,
Vice President Joseph Msika announced a sharp increase in the
total, saying more than 3,000 farms will be resettled.
</P>
<P>
   A top official sketched out the plan Tuesday, saying the army
will be called in to help move 500,000 landless black families onto
the confiscated lands before the rainy season in November.
Procedures to nationalize the first 211 farms will start by the end
of the week, preparing the way for resettlement of an initial group
of 37,000 families, Local Government Minister Ignatius Chombo said.
</P>
<P>
   With the expanded seizure, the government now plans to take 12
million of the 19 million acres owned by whites, Msika said. He
said the government will use a recent law allowing it to take
private property without compensation.
</P>
<P>
   White farmers have expressed shock at the plan, first reported
by government radio on Sunday. Farmers' leaders held crisis
meetings Tuesday to prepare a response, but they had no immediate
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers' silence was in part a reflection of the massive
confusion here over the government's intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's announcement followed two days of hazy accounts
in state media, which first reported the escalation in land
seizures and then suddenly backed off. Earlier, the government said
it was beginning immediate resettlement on nationalized land on
July 15 but none has occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the uncertainty, it remained unclear how the
government could accomplish the resettlement.
</P>
<P>
   The 40,000-strong Zimbabwe army, which is supposed to help, has
11,000 of its best troops backing the Congolese president in his
nation's two-year civil war. And military officials admitted
earlier this year that some troops were on forced leave to cut
costs and that the army's transport capacity was only about 200
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Chombo expressed confidence that the army has the ability to
pull off the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has the vehicles needed to move people from one point to
the other. It will also establish a communications center to ensure
decisions are made fast and are implemented,'' he said in the
government-run Herald newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The seizure plan is the latest episode in a six-month siege of
white farmers' property in Zimbabwe, where the tiny white minority
-- most descendants of British and South African settlers from
Zimbabwe's days as a British colony -- owns about a third of the
productive land.
</P>
<P>
   In February, government-backed squatters started occupying more
than 1,600 white farms, trapping some white farmers in their homes
and attacking others. President Robert Mugabe called the
occupations a legitimate protest against unfair ownership of land,
though opposition leaders said he was just trying to boost his
support among landless blacks in advance of parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Political violence since the seizures began has claimed at least
31 lives, mostly opposition supporters and white farmers, and has
thrown Zimbabwe's agriculture-based economy into turmoil. Farms
disruptions by violent occupiers have cut the nation's wheat and
tobacco production, and white leaders warn that further land
confiscations without carefully planned resettlement on productive
farms will likely trigger food shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe's largest labor group said Tuesday that it will go
ahead with a nationwide strike planned for Wednesday to protest the
land seizures and political violence, but said it will shorten the
shutdown to one day instead of three to avoid damaging the already
faltering economy. The Commercial Farmers' Union, which represents
the country's 4,000 white farmers, has said it will join the
strike.
</P>
<P>
   The farmer's union said it received reports that the militants
occupying farms -- including armed veterans of the bush war that
ended white rule here in 1980 -- have been instructed by Mugabe's
government to step up intimidation on farms whose owners join the
strike.

<HEADLINE> Germany Struggling With Neo-Nazis  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL GEITNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- With statistics confirming an alarming rise in
neo-Nazi violence this year, officials pledged Tuesday to step up
police pressure on Germany's far right, including shutting down
extremist Web sites where possible.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal interior ministry officials said they had
agreed to set up a national database listing anyone convicted of
neo-Nazi or anti-foreigner offenses and to take steps to try to
block neo-Nazi homepages on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Internet is becoming -- slowly but very noticeably -- a
platform for extreme-right agitating, and one shouldn't just watch
it and do nothing,'' said parliamentary president Wolfgang Thierse.
</P>
<P>
   Proposals were also made to increase police presence at
potential hot spots and to improve security at Jewish sites.
</P>
<P>
   Demands also mounted for the government and judicial system to
impose tougher penalties on neo-Nazis convicted of attacks on
foreigners and other violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin's commissioner of foreigner affairs, Barbara John, said
robbers or thieves are often punished more severely than someone
convicted of causing bodily harm by beating up a foreigner.
</P>
<P>
   ''Violence is made too easy, violence remains practically
unpunished or punished too little,'' she told WDR radio.
</P>
<P>
   Interior Ministry state secretary Cornelie Wolgast said the
issue would also be addressed at a government-sponsored roundtable
with business and labor on job creation. Right-wing violence ''has
to be ostracized by the entire society,'' she said after a meeting
of federal interior, justice and family ministry officials.
</P>
<P>
   Demands for a crackdown on right-wing extremism mounted after an
explosion last week at a train station injured 10 recent immigrants
from the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Police in Duesseldorf said Tuesday the blast was caused by an
old hand grenade that had been rebuilt, but did not identify its
origin. They also said they had received six claims of
responsibility for the attack, but haven't been able to verify any
of them.
</P>
<P>
   Officials have said, however, that anti-foreigner sentiment was
among the most likely motives.
</P>
<P>
   Right-wing violence directed against foreigners has been on the
increase in Germany, especially in the east, which is still
suffering from high unemployment and the drastic social changes
that followed the collapse of communism.
</P>
<P>
   Two new instances of neo-Nazi activity were reported Tuesday:
</P>
<P>
   Police said they found swastikas spray-painted on 15 cars at a
Volkswagen dealership near Leipzig -- the second such attack in the
area in two weeks. And police on the Baltic Sea resort island of
Ruegen reported 10 youths marched down a beach in Goehren Monday
night shouting ''Sieg Heil'' and other Nazi slogans.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics released by the government Tuesday showed 157
anti-Semitic offenses in the second quarter of this year, 17 more
than in the first three months and 47 more than the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Just for the month of June, 129 offenses with extreme-right
connections were recorded, including 28 attacks on individuals and
two arsons. That was 47 more than in May and 32 more than June
1999.
</P>
<P>
   But out of 144 suspects investigated in June, only 12 were taken
into custody and charges were brought against only nine, said
lawmaker Ulla Jelpke from the opposition Party of Democratic
Socialism.
</P>
<P>
   ''In other words, more than 90 percent of the extreme-right
perpetrators are running around free again,'' she said, demanding
tougher penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors have recently begun taking over high-profile
cases of neo-Nazi violence from state officials in an attempt to
demonstrate how seriously the government takes such crimes and to
deter copycats.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Minister Herta Daeubler-Gmelin said new laws were not
needed to fight right-wing violence, but that existing laws must be
more strictly enforced.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who commits an anti-foreigner crime must know ''that
he'll be brought before the court quickly and punished hard,'' she
said in Tuesday's Berliner Zeitung.

<HEADLINE> State's first witnesses says New York was looking out for Cayugas  </HEADLINE>
By WILLIAM KATES
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - New York acted honorably in acquiring
Cayuga Indian lands two centuries ago and even took steps to
protect the Iroquois tribe, a Canadian anthropologist testified
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After two weeks of listening to how New York officials lied,
bribed and cheated the Cayugas out of their 64,027-acre
reservation, U.S. District Judge Neal McCurn heard a different
historical perspective from the state's first witness, Alexander
von Gernet.
</P>
<P>
   McCurn previously ruled that New York illegally acquired the
Cayugas reservation land in 1795 and 1807 by purchasing it from the
tribe in violation of the 1790 Indian Trade and Intercourse Act,
which required Congressional approval for all Indian land
transactions. Following a monthlong trial, a federal court jury in
February awarded the Cayugas $36.9 million for their lost ancestral
lands.
</P>
<P>
   The judge is now weighing historical and economic factors to
decide whether the jury's award should be increased.
</P>
<P>
   It is important to look at the pre-Revolutionary War years to
understand New York's behavior dealing with Native Americans after
that time, said von Gernet, a Native American expert from the
University of Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   It was long-standing policy that New York assumed authority over
Indian land transactions within its borders, von Gernet said.
Historical documents show that as early as 1684, the colonial
governor was required to approve any land deals with Indian tribes,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   That policy was carried forward in other treaties, laws and
proclamations enacted over the next century, von Gernet testified.
It was a policy also included in the state constitution, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Congress was a newfangled institution. Colonial New York had a
longrunning relationship with the tribes,'' von Gernet said. ''The
idea of dealing firsthand with the Iroquois had a long history in
New York. It was not one that emerged after the Revolutionary
War.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cayugas fought on the British side in the Revolutionary War
and there was widespread sentiment in the fledgling federal
government and among New York lawmakers to treat the tribe as a
conquered people and make them wards of the state, von Gernet said.
</P>
<P>
   However, then Gov. George Clinton ignored the warnings and
instead decided to broker a treaty with them, von Gernet testified.
Although the state clearly came out the winner by gaining ownership
of Indian lands, the treaty also ensured reservation land would be
set aside for the Cayugas and protected them from unscrupulous
individuals who were striking private deals to buy their land, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Von Gernet also testified:
</P>
<P>
   -That it was the Cayugas who tried to dispose of their land for
22 years before the 1795 sales and first approached the state about
buying their reservation land.
</P>
<P>
   -That the Iroquois Grand Council had dissolved during the
Revolutionary War, leaving the Cayugas and other tribes to each
follow its own course. The Cayugas' witnesses have testified that
in agreeing to the 1795 treaty, New York knowingly ignored Iroquois
tradition, which required the Grand Council's consensus to make the
treaty binding.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, von Gernet said, following the war, the Cayugas
split into factions led by local chiefs who earned their position
through achievement as opposed to inheriting them.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was considerable confusion about who was empowered in
diplomatic discourse,'' von Gernet told McCurn.
</P>
<P>
   He said the majority faction led by Fish Carrier moved to
Buffalo Creek in western New York and tried to sell off the Cayugas
lands to private individuals in deals that were determined illegal
by state lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The minority faction, led by Steel Trap, returned to the Cayuga
Lake area, where faced with an onslaught of settlers, it eventually
worked out the 1789 lease giving all the tribe's lands to New York
except for the 64,000-acre reservation.

<HEADLINE> Penn Traffic to open nine supermarkets in Vermont and New Hampshire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SYRACUSE, N.Y. (AP) - A decade after it pulled out of New
England, Penn Traffic Co. is going back.
</P>
<P>
   The company announced Tuesday that it had regained operating
control of six supermarkets in Vermont and three others in New
Hampshire and will have all of them open in the next two weeks. The
stores have been leased to The Grand Union Co. since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are excited about doing business again in Vermont and New
Hampshire,'' said Joseph V. Fisher, president and chief executive
officer of the struggling supermarket chain. ''Our associates are
working hard to restock the shelves and spruce up the stores as
soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Grand opening ceremonies for the stores in Vermont and New
Hampshire are set for Aug. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Penn Traffic owns and operates 220 supermarkets in upstate New
York, Ohio, West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Vermont and New Hampshire
under the Big Bear, Big Bear Plus, Bi-Lo, Quality, and P&AMP;C names.
</P>
<P>
   Penn Traffic reported a loss of $26.7 million, or $1.33 per
share, for the first quarter that ended April 29. It has now lost
nearly $87 million since emerging from bankruptcy reorganization
last June.

<HEADLINE> Brown Not Charged in Knife Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEECH ISLAND, S.C. (AP) -- Investigators say they could not find
enough evidence to charge James Brown, who was accused of swinging
a knife at a utility worker.
</P>
<P>
   The worker had filed a criminal incident report on July 13, more
than a week after the alleged incident at the home of the
67-year-old Godfather of Soul.
</P>
<P>
   According to police, the worker went to Brown's home to respond
to a complaint of a power outage. The worker entered through an
unlocked security gate, and Brown allegedly accused him of
trespassing and approached him with a steak knife.
</P>
<P>
   The utility company said there was nothing wrong with Brown's
electricity and they didn't know who called in the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, whose hits include ''I Got You (I Feel Good),'' and
''Papa's Got a Brand New Bag,'' served a sentence for assault and
weapons convictions from 1988 to 1991. In 1998, he completed a
90-day drug treatment program to avoid a two-year prison sentence
on marijuana and gun charges. Brown said he used the marijuana for
medicinal purposes to treat eye ailments.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mick Jagger got no satisfaction in family court
Tuesday when his request to be exempted from revealing his finances
in a child custody case was denied.

<P>
   New York law requires that a child support order be based on the

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Barbra Streisand is sticking to her plan to sing
only two farewell shows in New York -- and those shows sold out in
no time.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets to the Sept. 27-28 performances at Madison Square Garden
sold out hours after they went on sale Monday. Prices ranged from
$125 to $1,500, with VIP tickets going for $2,500, including
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Streisand has said the shows plus two performances in Los
Angeles on Sept. 20-21 will mark the end of her concert career.
</P>
<P>
   ''Garden officials requested two additional concerts in New
York, but she held to her pledge that the pair would be her final
public performances,'' said the singer's publicist, Ken Sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Streisand's live performances have been infrequent. Prior to a

<HEADLINE> Study Looks At Gun-Control Act  </HEADLINE>
By LINDSEY TANNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- A new study finds that murder and suicide rates
did not drop any faster in states that had to toughen their laws to
comply with the 1994 Brady Act to regulate handguns.
</P>
<P>
   The study also reports, however, that fewer people 55 and older
used guns to kill themselves after the act took effect.
</P>
<P>
   The findings provoked strong words on both sides of the
gun-control debate; they were also questioned in an editorial that
accompanied the study in Wednesday's Journal of the American
Medical Association. The AMA supported the Brady Act.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association claimed the research supports the
notion that gun regulations like the Brady Act have no effect on
crime. Advocates of stricter gun laws said the study is not an
appropriate measure of the success or failure of the Brady Act.
</P>
<P>
   The findings follow research presented last week by the Center
to Prevent Handgun Violence, which estimates that 9,368 lives were
saved between 1994 and 1998 because guns were less available to
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the center, Sarah Brady, is married to James Brady,
for whom the act is named. Brady was the press secretary wounded
and paralyzed in the 1981 assassination attempt on President
Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   As implemented in 1994, the Brady Act required licensed dealers
to perform background checks and observe a five-day waiting period
before selling handguns. In 1998, instant background checks
replaced the waiting period requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Eighteen states already met the Brady requirements in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The lead authors of the study, Georgetown University policy
analyst Jens Ludwig and Philip Cook of Duke University, examined
national statistics from 1985 through 1997 to compare the Brady
law's impact on crime in the 32 states that had to toughen their
laws.
</P>
<P>
   The authors noted that homicide and suicide rates had already
begun to decline nationwide before 1994, but they assumed those
rates would fall faster in ''treatment states'' -- those that had to
adopt new laws to comply.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they found no overall difference -- except that gun
suicides dropped 6 percent among people aged 55 and older in the
treatment states, Ludwig said.
</P>
<P>
   Reductions in suicides also were seen in other age groups but
the numbers were not statistically significant, Ludwig said.
Suicides are comparatively common in older adults, so it's not
surprising that the biggest impact would be found in that age
group, he said.
</P>
<P>
   National Rifle Association spokeswoman Kelly Whitley said the
study ''proves what the NRA has been saying all along. Legislation
like the Brady Act ... has no impact on the criminal misuse of
firearms.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ludwig acknowledged that the research was not designed to
analyze the Brady Act's indirect impact on what is known as the
secondary gun market -- gun sales by unlicensed dealers -- which
experts say is the source of a significant number of weapons used
in crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The findings show ''the importance of extending regulations like
the Brady Act to secondary market sales,'' Ludwig said.
</P>
<P>
   The editorial in JAMA, written by a crime expert not involved
with the new study, questioned the meaning of the research and
called the Brady Act ''the most important national policy
initiative related to firearms in over two decades.''
</P>
<P>
   The editorial's author, Richard Rosenfeld of the department of
criminology and criminal justice at the University of Missouri in
St. Louis, said the study was limited by a lack of evidence of the
Brady Act's impact on firearm trafficking from state to state and
by its failure to examine the secondary gun market.
</P>
<P>
   He said the examination of the law's impact on suicide was a
strong point of the research.
</P>
<P>
   ''Knowledge of how primary market regulations affect the
secondary firearms market is the single most important next step in
research on how the Brady Act and similar strategies affect levels
of criminal violence in the United States,'' Rosenfeld wrote.

<HEADLINE> Vatican Pushes on Jerusalem Issue  </HEADLINE>
By ELLEN KNICKMEYER
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- The Vatican held to its own hard line
Tuesday on the future of Jerusalem, insisting in talks with
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright that the city's warren of
holy sites and religions needs international oversight.
</P>
<P>
   Albright listened, but made clear the Vatican proposal for
international stewardship of the holy sites had no takers at Camp
David.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody wanted -- I mean, at Camp David certainly the issue of
internationalization was not the solution,'' Albright told a Rome
news conference before talks at the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   Albright interrupted her trip home from an Asian tour to discuss
the current status of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations with her
counterpart at the Vatican, where Pope John Paul II had watched --
and spoken out on -- the Camp David talks from afar.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S.-brokered talks deadlocked on the crucial issue of
Israel's and the Palestinians rival claims to Jerusalem as their
capital. Palestinians, particularly, insisted on nothing less than
full sovereignty over east Jerusalem, where a half-mile holds sites
holy to Christians, Muslims and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   With no direct say in the Israel-Palestinian negotiations, John
Paul made his case before pilgrims in St. Peter's Square during the
talks, urging all sides ''not to overlook the importance of the
spiritual dimension of the city of Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Vatican's foreign minister, Archbishop
Jean-Louis Tauran, pressed the position John Paul laid out, saying
a ''special statute, internationally guaranteed,'' is a
''necessity'' for the city's sacred places.
</P>
<P>
   Tauran listed dialogue and respect for international decisions --
particularly U.N. resolutions -- as the other essentials for a
''just and lasting peace in that part of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   One long-standing U.N. resolution demands Israel withdraw from
territory occupied in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
   Tauran himself has spoken of Israel ''illegally occupying'' east
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The Vatican over the years has taken up the cause of pilgrims,
including Israeli security closures that Palestinian Muslims said
denied them access to holy sites for months at a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Jews were blocked from the Western Wall under Jordan's control
of east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The Holy See also worries over the diminishing presence of
Christians in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul's visit to the city -- long delayed by Mideast
conflicts -- this year provided some of the most emotional moments
of the 80-year-old pontiff's papacy.
</P>
<P>
   That papacy has seen a half-dozen meetings with Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat, starting in 1982, when Israel still was
calling Arafat a terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul's openness to Arafat and his support of a Palestinian
homeland provided international credibility at a time when they
badly needed it.
</P>
<P>
   Any influence that built up with the Palestinians hasn't been
enough so far to budge them on the essential issue of east
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were not interested in internationalization even though
they called for an open city,'' Albright told reporters in Rome of
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat has used the phrase ''open city'' to describe his plan
for Jerusalem for years, one that would allow free movement for all
in east Jerusalem under what he increasingly has made clear would
be full Palestinian sovereignty
</P>
<P>
   ''Exactly like Rome is the capital of the Vatican and of
Italy,'' Arafat said in Rome in 1996, on a trip to lobby Italy and
the Vatican.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Jerusalem question could make the peace process fail -- or
become the symbol of peaceful coexistence among Muslims, Christians
and Jews,'' Arafat said then.

<HEADLINE> 29 Killed in Kashmiri Attack  </HEADLINE>
By QAISER MIRZA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SRINAGAR, India (AP) -- Unarmed Hindu pilgrims and Muslim porters
came under rifle fire Tuesday on their way to a religious shrine in
disputed Kashmir, killing at least 29 people, police said.
Thirty-nine others were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack at
Pahalgam, 55 miles south of Srinagar, the capital of Kashmir. But
police said they suspected Islamic guerrillas fighting for
Kashmir's independence.
</P>
<P>
   The attack came as the federal government in New Delhi prepared
to talk to the main guerrilla group in Kashmir, which has been
wracked by an Islamic insurgency for 11 years.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an attempt to sabotage the peace process set in motion,''
said Chief Minister Farooq Abdullah, the highest elected official
in Kashmir. He said the militants were trying to create confusion
at a time when ''a silver lining has started to appear in the dark
clouds of violence.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah and the federal government have been trying to
negotiate with guerrilla groups, notably the Hezb-ul-Mujahedeen
outfit, which announced a unilateral cease-fire Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The attack came at a makeshift shack near the Ardoo Bridge on
the outskirts of town as the pilgrims were eating dinner, Press
Trust of India news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   ''First there were some gunshots. ... Soon the security forces
also began firing, said Muzaffar Wani, a Muslim businessman who was
on the pilgrimage and was hospitalized. ''It was chaotic. We
couldn't see who was firing at us.''
</P>
<P>
   Security forces and police fired back at the gunmen, who fled
under cover of darkness, said police and army officials reached by
telephone. Two militants and a policeman were among those killed,
Kulbushan Jandiyal, director of information of the state
government, told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The pilgrims had been walking to Amarnath Cave, a religious site
for Hindus in the mountains that takes two days to reach. The
government provides extensive security for pilgrims because of
threats from separatists.
</P>
<P>
   Army soldiers and paramilitary soldiers fanned out across the
mountains to search for the assailants.
</P>
<P>
   Some 20,000 pilgrims are camping in tents and hotels in
Pahalgam, where they begin a 30-mile trek into the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those killed were porters and men hired to ferry
pilgrims on their horses. Most of those hired are Muslim.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of Kashmir is controlled by India and the rest by
Pakistan. More than a dozen guerrilla groups have been fighting
security forces to make Kashmir independent.

<HEADLINE> France Keeps Concordes Grounded  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN GECKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- French authorities decided Tuesday to keep Air
France's Concordes grounded, saying the supersonic jetliners won't
fly again until investigators can recreate the events that sparked
last week's raging fire and deadly crash.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have not pinpointed what led to the Concorde's
dive into a hotel in the town of Gonesse, killing 113 people. A
panel of experts will convene Thursday to try to nail down what
happened, French Transport Minister Jean-Claude Gayssot said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until we pull together all these elements to establish a chain
of events, Air France flights will not be resumed,'' Gayssot said
after a Cabinet meeting. He said ''absolutely no one,'' including
Air France, had pressured authorities to resume flights.
</P>
<P>
   British and French aviation experts, meeting separately from
crash investigators in Paris, have failed so far to decide which
extra safety measures should be put into place -- another mandatory
step before the Air France Concorde flights can resume, the General
Direction for Civil Aviation said.
</P>
<P>
   France's pilots applauded the move.
</P>
<P>
   ''We believe this decision is very wise,'' said Patrick Auguin,
vice president of France's National Union of Air Pilots. ''It is
very important for Concorde pilots to have confidence in their
planes.''
</P>
<P>
   An Air France charter flight from Paris to New York crashed in a
ball of flames shortly after takeoff on July 25 just outside Paris,
killing all 109 people on board and four on the ground. Bodies of
the majority of those killed had not yet been identified or
released to families.
</P>
<P>
   Air France grounded its remaining five Concordes immediately
after the crash. The world's other seven Concordes, owned by
British Airways, resumed most flights after a day's pause.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Monday that it could take 18 months before
they could determine the cause of the accident.
</P>
<P>
   The Transport Ministry's Accident and Inquiry Office said seven
work groups had been formed to focus on key elements of the
investigation, including the wreckage, the aircraft's systems and
engines, preparation for flight and eyewitness accounts.
Investigators said Tuesday they had not found evidence of problems
prior to takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there is evidence that one or two of the Concorde's
tires exploded and one of the plane's engines shut down, followed
by the partial shutdown of another engine. In addition, the
undercarriage did not pull up and the jet had difficulty climbing
into the sky, never achieving sufficient speed, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   The Accident and Inquiry Office has said the flames spewing from
the side of the aircraft before it crashed most likely came from a
''major fuel leak'' and that part of a fuel tank was discovered on
the runway. Investigators said Tuesday that they have not found any
engine fragments on the runway.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, British Airways grounded one of its Concordes for
repairs Tuesday, delaying its morning flight to New York by more
than two hours.
</P>
<P>
   The plane scheduled to take the flight had just had an engine
changed, and technicians felt more adjustments needed to be made,
British Airways reported. Another Concorde was assigned to the
flight.
</P>
<P>
   Two days earlier, a British Airways Concorde flying from London
to New York had to make an emergency stop in eastern Canada after
the plane's captain smelled fuel in the cabin. Despite that and two
other weekend incidents, British Airways said it expected to
continue operating regular service out of London and New York.

<HEADLINE> New York's popular game species lucrative for hunters  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Hunters had a successful season with wild
turkeys, despite the number going down slightly from last year's
take.
</P>
<P>
   Wild turkeys, indigenous to the area but absent from New York
for almost 100 years, have returned in large numbers, according to
John Cahill, commissioner of the state Department of Environmental
Conservation.
</P>
<P>
   Cahill said wild turkey is the second most popular game to hunt,
with 250,000 hunters annually. This year hunters took 8,766
turkeys, down about 200 from last year, according to the DEC.
</P>
<P>
   They speculated the unusually cool and rainy summer may have
influenced numbers.

<HEADLINE> Comptroller projects $516.2 million surplus  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The state comptroller on Tuesday
projected that Connecticut will end the 2000 fiscal year with a
budget surplus of $516.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Comptroller Nancy Wyman's estimate is about $46 million higher
than last month's. Wyman said higher-than-expected consumer
spending drove up tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
   Combined, the income and sales taxes will produce more than $7.3
billion, or nearly $347 million over original estimates.
</P>
<P>
   About $196 million of the surplus has already been allocated by
the Legislature. Another $35 million must go to the state's
emergency rainy day fund.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the nearly $285 million surplus will fund
various school construction projects.
</P>
<P>
   The final surplus figure for the fiscal year will be released
Aug. 31.

<HEADLINE> Alan Alda Shows TV Influences  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- There's often an air of pomposity whenever
actors from film or theater discuss their craft.
</P>
<P>
   That's usually not the case with television, if they are asked
at all. As an art form, the box in everyone's home doesn't get the
same respect as the big screen or the Broadway boards.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's odd,'' actor Alan Alda said. ''As soon as television was
possible, everyone was watching it, and people would have to be
influenced by it, either positively or negatively.''
</P>
<P>
   Alda narrates an illuminating attempt to tie television's
present to its past, ''Influences,'' which premieres on Bravo on
Sunday at 7:30 p.m. Eastern (Aug. 6). Eight episodes of the
half-hour series, the first produced by the Museum of Television &AMP;
Radio, have been made and more will come if the response is
positive.
</P>
<P>
   The avuncular Alda is an ideal selection because he straddles TV
generations. While he tackles new roles like the
Alzheimer's-afflicted doctor on ''ER'' last season, his work as
Hawkeye Pierce on ''M A S H'' lives on in rerun perpetuity.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in California, Alda wanted to be a writer. Watching
people like Sid Caesar and Lucille Ball on television helped put
him in front of the camera.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although they were doing half-hour comedy, they were working
in a style where it was a little play,'' he said. ''They were
acting, they weren't doing standup comedy. It was very instructive
to watch it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Influences'' lacks the heft of Bravo's film forum, ''Inside
the Actor's Studio,'' but thankfully also lacks the pervasive
self-importance. The breezy conversations with people like Ted
Danson, Ray Romano, Tracey Ullman and John Lithgow are richly
illustrated with clips from the museum's archives.
</P>
<P>
   When Danson reveals that he used Andy Griffith as a role model
for how Sam Malone tolerated the idiosyncracies of everyone at the
bar on ''Cheers,'' Griffith appears on the screen with Don Knotts'
Barney Fife.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not quite Shakespeare for Lithgow, who credits ''The
Three Stooges'' for some of his physical comedy in ''3rd Rock From
the Sun.'' He can take Larry, Moe and Curly, he admits, only ''in
small doses.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best of the series pairs Roseanne with David Chase,
creator of ''The Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I lived for television growing up,'' Roseanne explains. ''The
whole world of it just sucked me into another dimension.''
</P>
<P>
   Her father would let Roseanne stay up to watch Johnny Carson's
monologue on the ''Tonight'' show as a reward for doing the dishes.
''I looked at Johnny Carson every night and willed myself to be
sitting there,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The show runs tape of a demurely dressed Roseanne making her
''Tonight'' show debut. She made a joke that night about June
Cleaver, leading ''Influences'' to contrast the idyllic 1950s world
of ''Leave it to Beaver'' with the rougher, blue-collar household
on Roseanne's own sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   Chase talks about how he and his father used to sit and watch
''The Untouchables'' together. He explains his admiration for
''Twin Peaks,'' showing how a surrealistic dream sequence from that
series was an antecedent to Tony Soprano's talking fish in this
season's finale of ''The Sopranos.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm attracted as a viewer to things that just meander,'' Chase
says.
</P>
<P>
   Alda believes that if ''Influences'' is made 20 years from now
with contemporary TV stars, ''The Sopranos'' will be one of the
shows they cite. He sees the series as a way of keeping
television's creative past alive.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the museum can give people who currently do television an
opportunity to go back to these high-water marks and draw
inspiration from them, they won't disappear,'' he said. ''They
won't just have been a moment that people enjoyed that passed.''
</P>
<P>
   The actor is a trustee of the Museum of Television &AMP; Radio,
which has branches in New York and Los Angeles. He and Bob Batscha,
the museum's president, also see the series as a way to let people
who can't get to the two facilities use its archives.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, people are coming to realize the importance of
television as a creative art form, Batscha said.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is looking for new material, even as it tends to its
collection of material from TV's formative years. Even this
summer's guilty-pleasure hit, ''Survivor,'' has a place.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can see why people are captivated by it,'' Batscha said.
''Is it Shakespeare? No, but who would make that comparison? Will
it be in the museum? Of course, it will be. People will want to
answer the question, why did it connect with people in the summer
of 2000?''

<HEADLINE> Indian Movie Star Is Kidnapped  </HEADLINE>
By K.N. ARUN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRAS, India (AP) -- For 30 years, Veerappan and his gang have
prowled the jungles of southern India, gunning down at least 130
policemen and slaughtering elephants, felling thousands of
sandalwood trees and kidnapping people, according to police.
</P>
<P>
   Among his latest victims is a 72-year-old movie star, Rajkumar,
abducted from his vacation home in the forests of Tamu Nidal state
on Sunday night along with three others.
</P>
<P>
   Veerappan, 56, has eluded police for 18 years but is believed to
be tired of running from the law and weakened by asthma. He has
offered to surrender in exchange for amnesty. He left an audio
cassette with the wife of the actor as he led his new hostages
away.
</P>
<P>
   Rajkumar's son, Ambareesh, told United News of India on Tuesday
that the eight-minute tape contained no ransom demand. In it
Veerappan warned that no Tamils should be hurt and demanded the
release of a man being held without trial.
</P>
<P>
   Veerappan -- who like many resident of southern India uses one
name -- has granted three interviews in the past, all of them to the
news magazine Nakeeran.
</P>
<P>
   He recounted in one videotaped interview how he killed his foes,
cutting up their bodies and floating them down the river or tying
up policemen and throwing them into anthills to die a slow, painful
death.
</P>
<P>
   Veerappan cupped his hands and trumpeted like an elephant or
imitated birds, deer and wild animals. He said elephants often
responded to his call, only to be shot dead.
</P>
<P>
   Veerappan said he shot his first elephant at age 10. He took to
regular ivory poaching and sandalwood smuggling in the early 1960s
and was first arrested in 1965 by Karnataka forest officials. But
he escaped, reportedly after smearing oil on his hands to slip out
of the handcuffs.
</P>
<P>
   The elusive gang leader uses his knowledge of the terrain and
animals, or the support of hunters and farmers, who regard him as a
saint. He is generous with gifts and money and has helped local
hunters over the years, in return for shelter or information about
police and forest guards.
</P>
<P>
   In a videotaped interview three years ago, Veerappan sported
olive-green fatigues and carried a gun in his hand. He is tall and
skinny, with a huge handlebar mustache and a prominent Adam's
apple.
</P>
<P>
   He became notorious in the 1980s, operating in the forests
contiguous to Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. His second arrest was in
1986 in Bangalore, but he escaped again and has not been captured
since. He once admitted to smothering his newborn daughter so her
crying wouldn't give away his hiding place.
</P>
<P>
   The 1991 killing of P. Srinivas, Karnataka Deputy Conservator of
Forests, was among his most brutal, police have said. Srinivas was
lured into the jungle on the pretext that Veerappan and his gang
were willing to surrender. A few days later, the beheaded body was
found at the edge of the forest.
</P>
<P>
   A special police and commando force reduced Veerappan's gang,
estimated at 150, to about a dozen in two years. Many died in
shootouts; others surrendered or were captured, including
Veerappan's brother, Arjunan.
</P>
<P>
   After Arjunan's arrest, Veerappan began kidnapping. Arjunan and
three other gang members died in police custody. They were said to
have committed suicide by taking poison, but Veerappan claimed they
were tortured and killed.

   WUERZBURG, Germany (AP) -- Taking less than an hour to
deliberate, a military court sentenced a U.S. soldier on Tuesday to
life in prison without parole for killing an 11-year-old ethnic
Albanian girl while on peacekeeping duty in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what went wrong that day,'' Army Staff Sgt. Frank
Ronghi, 36, of Niles, Ohio, said in an apology ''from the bottom of
my heart'' to the family of Merita Shabiu.
</P>
<P>
   But Merita's mother, Remzije, said the killing was all the more
painful because it was at the hands of a NATO soldier sent to
protect ethnic Albanians. ''Not only Merita died. We all died,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ronghi, who sat impassively as the verdict was read, pleaded
guilty on Friday to charges of murder, forcible sodomy and indecent
acts in the Jan. 13 death of Merita.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know what I did was very wrong,'' he told the court Tuesday.
''That's why I pleaded guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I apologize from the bottom of my heart to the family. I ask
them for forgiveness,'' Ronghi said, reading from a piece of paper
and showing no emotion.
</P>
<P>
   But the girl's father, Hamdi Shabiu, said through a translator
that while they were satisfied with the verdict and the Army's
handling of the case, the family would never be able to forgive
Ronghi.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he had accidentally killed her, we would forgive him on the
spot,'' he said, his distraught wife at his side. ''But not only
did he do what he did to her, he wanted to hide her body, so that
we would not even have a grave for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronghi was led out of the courtroom to be returned to the U.S.
military stockade in Mannheim. An Army spokesman, Maj. Eric Gunhus,
said it would probably take a week to 10 days before Ronghi is
flown from Germany to Fort Leavenworth, Kan., to begin serving his
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   In an emotional day of testimony, prosecutors described in
painstaking detail how Ronghi lured the girl into a basement where
he assaulted her, then killed her to stop her cries.
</P>
<P>
   He came back later for the body, stuffed under a stairway in two
U.N. flour sacks, and buried it beneath the snow on a hilltop. A
private who accompanied Ronghi reported the incident to superiors.
</P>
<P>
   Merita's parents and two siblings, who traveled from Kosovo for
Ronghi's sentencing, had left the courtroom by the time Ronghi
apologized.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are simple people, but we have seen justice work,'' the
father said.
</P>
<P>
   Ronghi, a weapons squad leader assigned to the 3rd Battalion,
504th Parachute Infantry Regiment at Fort Bragg, N.C., also
apologized to the Army, his unit and his family ''for all the hurt
I have caused.''
</P>
<P>
   The defense opened by describing Ronghi ''as an ordinary person
who did ordinary things,'' until he encountered a culture of
excessive violence and abuse of power during duty in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was while he was in Kosovo that he stumbled,'' Capt. Kerry
Suneo said. ''He stumbled hard. He'll be the first to tell you
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Testifying, Merita's parents described their escape to Macedonia
from Serb persecution -- and the relief they felt at being able to
return home under the protection of NATO forces after the bombing
stopped June 15, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   They stressed that they did not blame the U.S. military for
their loss. ''The whole army did not do this to me,'' Hamdi Shabiu
said. ''This was Ronghi's fault.''

<HEADLINE> 'Survivor' Rules Prime Time  </HEADLINE>
By FRAZIER MOORE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- An island, a house and the seat across from
Regis: Those are the places that most viewers have their eyes on
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   CBS's ''Survivor'' remained the top-rated prime-time show last
week, according to Nielsen Media Research figures released Tuesday.
About 27 million viewers watched college student Jenna get voted
off the island.
</P>
<P>
   Next-ranked were the Sunday, Thursday and Tuesday editions of
ABC's Regis Philbin-hosted game show, ''Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came CBS's ''Big Brother,'' which landed in fifth place
with its live Wednesday edition airing after ''Survivor.'' The
week's other five installments of this voyeur-vision series didn't
fare as well, ranking 20, 29, 45, 48 and 75.
</P>
<P>
   For the week, ABC and CBS tied, each scoring a 6.6 household
rating and a 12 share, though ABC edged out CBS in average viewers
-- 9.70 million to 9.55 million. NBC had 8.87 million viewers (6.2
rating and 11 share), and Fox had 5.91 million (4.0 rating, 7
share).
</P>
<P>
   UPN had 3.19 million viewers (2.0, 4), the WB had 2.42 million
(1.6, 3) and Pax TV had 1.4 million (1.0, 2).
</P>
<P>
   NBC's ''Nightly News'' won the evening news ratings derby with
9.74 million viewers (7.2 rating, 16 share). ABC's ''World News
Tonight'' had 8.81 million viewers (6.7, 15), while ''The CBS
Evening News'' had 7.75 million viewers (6.0, 13).
</P>
<P>
   A rating point represents 1,008,000 households, or 1 percent of
the nation's estimated 100.8 million TV homes. Share is the
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show.
</P>
<P>
   For the week of July 24-30, the top 10 shows, their networks and
ratings were:
</P>
<P>
   ''Survivor,'' CBS, 16.3; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire''
(Sunday), ABC, 15.2; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Thursday),
ABC, 14.8; ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (Tuesday), ABC, 13.5;
''Big Brother'' (Wednesday), CBS, 10.4; ''The Practice,'' ABC, 9.9;
''Law &AMP; Order'' (Wednesday), NBC, 9.1; ''Everybody Loves Raymond,''
CBS, 8.9; ''Law &AMP; Order'' (Monday), NBC, 8.5; ''Mysterious Ways,''
NBC, 8.4.

<HEADLINE> West Nile is here to stay, experts say  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - The West Nile virus is here to stay and is
likely to keep spreading into other areas of the country, experts
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although there have been no reports of human infections so far
this year, ''we have to redouble our efforts, because now is the
time when you would see any human cases,'' said Dr. Steven Ostroff,
a West Nile authority at the national Centers for Disease Control
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   With the mosquito-borne virus appearing this year in
Connecticut, New Jersey and Maryland, ''the range is wider than
last year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ostroff spoke on a panel at New York University Medical Center
convened by three members of Congress ''because New Yorkers have as
many questions as answers'' on how to protect themselves, said Sen.
Charles Schumer, D-NY.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, with Queens as the epicenter, the first U.S. case of
West Nile was reported in late August; a total of seven people in
the New York area died and 62 were infected.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year the virus has appeared only in birds and
mosquitoes - bloodsucking insects that can spread West Nile to
humans. The latest infestation seems to be centered around Staten
Island.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nita Lowey, D-NY, said New Yorkers are confused about how
to act on a day-to-day basis, asking questions like, ''Do I go to
Central Park, do I not go to Central Park?''
</P>
<P>
   And especially when it comes to their children, they wonder:
''Are they better off wearing long sleeves and gloves, or just
staying in the house all summer?''
</P>
<P>
   Over the winter, health authorities set up a monitoring system
to locate and destroy insects infected with the virus while they
were hibernating. And several weeks ago, trucks started spraying
neighborhoods where West Nile-bearing mosquitoes or birds were
found, including Central Park and parts of Long Island and
Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   The system ''is working,'' said Ostroff, judging by the lack of
human infection.
</P>
<P>
   Despite some public concern, the spraying compounds being used
are among the safest available, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ostroff was introduced by Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-NY, as the
nation's West Nile ''czar,'' backed by $20 million in federal
funding for research and prevention of the virus over a two-year
period.
</P>
<P>
   ''The data are telling us that the virus is here to stay, and is
likely to keep moving to other areas,'' Ostroff concluded. Agreed
Dr. Marty Blazer, an NYU specialist in infectious diseases: ''It
will not go away, it will remain in our ecosystem.''
</P>
<P>
   The West Nile virus is commonly found in Africa, Eastern Europe,
West Asia and the Middle East. Its appearance in the New York area
last year was the first in the Western Hemisphere, prompting a
massive campaign of aerial and ground spraying to kill mosquitoes.
</P>
<P>
   The first case was detected by Dr. Deborah Asnis, director of
infectious diseases at Flushing Hospital Medical Center in Queens.
In August of last year, she contacted the city's Department of
Health to report two patients with encephalitis, a swelling of the
brain which can be caused by West Nile.
</P>
<P>
   From now on, ''we believe knowledge and understanding are the
most effective antidote,'' Asnis said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   While some people infected with West Nile show no symptoms,
others suffer from a flu-like condition that can include high
fever, gastrointenstinal problems, muscle ache, a headache, or
mental confusion.
</P>
<P>
   The only sure way to diagnose an infection is through a test
that detects antibodies to the virus, said Dr. Marcy Layton, the
Health Department's assistant commissioner for communicable
diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Warned Schumer: ''There should be no fear, no panic - but you
can't be too careful.''

<P>
	   MIDDLE ISLAND, N.Y. (AP) - A new federally funded program
designed to give local schools the flexibility to shape their own
drug and alcohol prevention programs will begin at four schools in
eastern Suffolk County.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Michael Forbes and U.S. Secretary of Education Richard
Riley announced Tuesday that four middle schools - Central Islip,
Longwood Central and South County Central school districts - would
receive a federal grant totaling $839,000.
</P>
<P>
   The money will be used to fund the hiring and training of three
new full-time coordinators for the Safe and Drug Free Schools
program. The coordinators will work with students and parents in
designing and implementing drug and alcohol prevention programs
tailored to their needs.
</P>
<P>
   ''Feeling safe in school is directly related to increased
learning,'' said Forbes. ''This new program is a step in the right
direction because it gives the schools flexibility.''

<HEADLINE> Colombian Attacks Trigger Response  </HEADLINE>
By WILL WEISSERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Colombian rebels have adopted the tactic
of hurling hundreds of combatants against small police outposts in
remote areas, and apparently taking no prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   But as the police body count rises, so is the storm of protest
against the rebels, who last weekend demolished most of a remote
mountain village in their assault.
</P>
<P>
   ''The world should be watching these attacks, they are
international atrocities,'' Monsignor Alberto Gilbert, head of the
Roman Catholic Church's conference of bishops in Colombia, told The
Associated Press on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend attack on the village of Arboleda, 90 miles
northwest of the capital Bogota, by hundreds of rebels of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, killed at least 14
police officers and four civilians. Security forces were searching
on Tuesday for more victims.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels first used two car bombs to blow up the Arboleda
police station and three other buildings, crushing about a dozen
people inside. The guerrillas hurled dynamite wrapped in burning
cloth into the remains of the police station while others detonated
smaller explosives they had planted around the area.
</P>
<P>
   A church, a bank and a health clinic were among the buildings
that were demolished in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, a spokesman for the U.S. State Department called
the rebels' action ''bloody and irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly the 15,000-strong FARC has taken to attacking rural
hamlets without warning, pitting hundreds of rebels against usually
no more than a dozen or two police officers. Civilians are left to
fend for themselves in the crossfire.
</P>
<P>
   On July 15, the FARC attacked the police station in the
southwestern Colombian town of Roncesvalles. After their ammunition
ran out, 13 policemen surrendered to the rebels. The guerrillas
then systematically executed the policemen.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Miguel Vivanco, executive director of the Human Rights
Watch-Americas, noted that not all policemen and security forces
are involved in the fight with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we see these kind of extra-judicial killings it's clear
that Colombia's violence has reached massive and extraordinary
levels,'' Vivanco said in a phone interview from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are no words to sufficiently condemn the terrible acts
of barbarism committed by these guerrillas,'' Colombian President
Andres Pastrana told a crowd Tuesday during a public ceremony in
the southwestern city of Neiva.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana said the rebels this year have killed 73 police
officers, destroyed 51 villages and killed more than 42 civilians.
</P>
<P>
   It is not known why the rebels adopted their latest strategy,
but it is clear why it has been successful so far. Government
forces cannot protect every town, and with the villages so isolated
a large force of rebels can overwhelm a police station and escape
while reinforcements are struggling to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are astonished that those who carry out (these attacks)
pretend to be fighting for their people,'' Pastrana said.
</P>
<P>
   However, human rights observers have also criticized government
security forces and their de facto allies, right-wing paramilitary
groups, of numerous human rights violations.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Denounces U.S. Stance  </HEADLINE>
By ZEINA KARAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- In an escalating war of words, Hezbollah
on Tuesday denounced statements by a U.S. official branding the
Islamic militant group as terrorist and accused the United States
of committing ''terrorist aggression'' against Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   A statement issued by the Iran-backed group in Beirut also
repeated that any decision to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv
to Jerusalem would be tantamount to an ''aggression'' against all
Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   ''The shameful American decision to move the U.S. Embassy to
occupied Jerusalem is an expression of the official terrorist
policy that the United States sponsors and fully supports,'' the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Such a decision constitutes a terrorist aggression against the
people of our nation and its sacred rights ... and provides a
flagrant cover for Zionist terrorism.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to recent comments by President Clinton that he was
considering moving the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem before
the end of the year, Hezbollah's leader, Sheik Hassan Nasrallah,
warned Sunday that American envoys would be sent home in coffins if
that happened.
</P>
<P>
   ''The honorable (Arab) people can turn your embassy to rubble
and return your diplomats in coffins,'' Nasrallah said.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. State Department expressed outrage Monday over
Nasrallah's remarks. ''Such violent threats deserve condemnation of
the entire international community,'' spokesman Philip Reeker said.
''This illustrates once again why that organization is on our list
of terrorist organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   In its statement Tuesday, Hezbollah's said Reeker's
''terrorist'' remarks were directed against the Lebanese people,
Palestinians and Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah, which fought Israeli troops in southern Lebanon
before they withdrew in May, was linked in the 1980s to a series of
attacks against U.S. interests in Lebanon that killed more than 270
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Militants also kidnapped Westerners, including Americans, and
held them for several years in Lebanon during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah has consistently denied ties to the anti-Western acts,
but Western intelligence reports have linked it with the militants
and the organization is still on the State Department's list of
terrorist organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement Tuesday, Hezbollah also called on Palestinians
to ''use all available means to defend'' Jerusalem and urged Arabs
and all Muslims to confront jointly what it termed U.S. and Israeli
attempts to rob them of what is theirs.
</P>
<P>
   Jerusalem is holy to Muslims, Christians and Jews alike.
Palestinians want the city's predominantly Arab east for the
capital of their future state, while Israel insists that Jerusalem
should remain undivided under its sovereignty.

<HEADLINE> Report: Viagra May Aid Diabetics  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE (AP) -- Viagra, the popular impotence drug for men,
could give relief to millions of diabetics who suffer from a
stomach condition that impedes digestion, according to new
research.
</P>
<P>
   The condition, called gastroparesis, affects as many as 12
million diabetics, and can trigger vomiting, dehydration and loss
of appetite.
</P>
<P>
   Viagra may ease the condition by helping stomach muscles to
relax, aiding in the passage of food, lead author Christopher
Ferris said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   As an impotency drug, Viagra works much the same way, causing
certain muscles in the penis to relax and allowing improved blood
flow.
</P>
<P>
   So far, researchers have only tested their findings on mice, but
a human clinical trial could begin as early as September, Ferris
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm quite optimistic,'' Ferris said, a professor at Vanderbilt
University Medical Center in Nashville, Tenn. ''I suspect what
we're seeing in the mice will be very similar to what we see in
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Viagra's manufacturer, Pfizer Inc., did not participate in the
study, Ferris said. The study appears in the August issue of
Journal of Clinical Investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Marc Rendell, who has studied the effects of Viagra on
diabetics as director of the Creighton Diabetes Center in Omaha,
Neb., said he was intrigued by the research, but questioned how
successful the drug will be in treating gastroparesis.
</P>
<P>
   ''I must say I haven't seen any particular effects in diabetic
patients that seem favorable,'' said Rendell, who was not involved
in the study. ''Some patients (who use Viagra) will actually
complain of stomach upset.''

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves ADS Drug  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The first single-dose form of the drug most
widely used to treat attention deficit disorder in children won
government approval Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration said it had approved Concerta
for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Between 4 percent and 12 percent of school-age children -- an
average of about 2.5 million, mostly boys -- are believed to have
ADHD. Symptoms include short attention span, impulsive behavior and
difficulty focusing and sitting still.
</P>
<P>
   Methylphenidate -- best known under the name Ritalin -- often is
prescribed to increase a child's alertness.
</P>
<P>
   But current forms of the drug require two or three doses daily,
often requiring youngsters to break up their schooldays with visits
to the nurse's office.
</P>
<P>
   The new drug lasts 12 hours, which will avoid in-school and
after-school dosing.
</P>
<P>
   Concerta was developed by Crescendo Pharmaceuticals Corp. and
will be manufactured and marketed by ALZA Corp. of Mountain View,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The new form of the drug will eliminate the stigma of taking a
drug in school and the problems of getting it to the school nurse
or interrupting after-school programs or practice, said Dan
Swisher, vice president of ALZA.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes the condition private. It eliminates the
embarrassment for children,'' he said in a telephone interview.

<P>
   Swisher said McNeill Consumer Healthcare is assisting in the
marketing of Concerta, which should be available in two weeks. He
said the price has not been determined but will be comparable to
other ADHD treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, people suffering from ADHD have problems following
instructions and paying attention. They may seem not to listen; be
disorganized; miss details; have trouble starting tasks, or
performing tasks that require planning or long-term effort; appear
to be easily distracted or forgetful. In many cases they seem
''hyper,'' being fidgety, impulsive and unable to wait their turn.
</P>
<P>
   Not all people with the disorder exhibit all the symptoms all
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the symptoms also are associated with youthful
rambunctiousness, which has raised questions whether today's
youngsters are being overdiagnosed and overdrugged.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the American Academy of Pediatrics issued in May
its first guidelines for ADHD, hoping to eliminate incorrect
diagnoses and ensure untreated children get the help they need.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines are for children 6 through 12. Most ADHD research
has involved that age group.
</P>
<P>
   Concerta is an extended-release formula in tablet form designed
to be taken in the morning before a child leaves for school.
</P>
<P>
   In clinical trials the most common side effects were headaches,
reported by 14 percent of patients. Less common were upper
respiratory tract infection and stomachache.

<HEADLINE> Arms Dealer To Face German Trial  </HEADLINE>
By STEPHEN GRAHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- The German-Canadian arms-industry lobbyist at the
heart of a corruption scandal that has engulfed former German
leader Helmut Kohl and his party will have to stand trial in
Germany, a judge ruled Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Karlheinz Schreiber, who is currently fighting efforts to
extradite him from Canada, will face charges including bribery and
tax evasion in connection with the 1991 delivery of German-built
tanks to Saudi Arabia, said Maximilian Hofmeister, a judge in the
southern town of Augsburg.
</P>
<P>
   Schreiber is suspected of being the go-between for secret
contributions to associates of Kohl that came to light last year,
triggering a wave of revelations about illegal donations to the
Christian Democratic party, which Kohl once headed.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl has been called before a parliamentary probe into whether
government decisions were influenced by the donations. The former
chancellor, while admitting that he accepted $1 million in
undeclared gifts from party supporters, has denied his government
was bought but refuses to name the party's benefactors.
</P>
<P>
   In the Augsburg case, Schreiber is accused of paying $1.8
million to Holger Pfahls, then a top official in the German defense
ministry, to ensure that 36 tanks were passed from the German army
to Saudi Arabia in 1991 after the German company Thyssen-Henschel
failed to deliver new units to the Saudi forces on time during the
Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Former Thyssen managers Juergen Massmann and Winifried Haastert
will also stand trial. they and Schreiber are also accused of
skimming off $12 million in undeclared commissions from the tank
deal.
</P>
<P>
   However, the judge decided not to pursue charges against former
party treasurer Walther Leisler Kiep for abetting tax evasion.
State prosecutors had argued that Kiep must have known that a
$500,000 cash donation from Schreiber to the Christian Democrats in
1991 hadn't been taxed.
</P>
<P>
   Hofmeister said it was impossible to say whether Schreiber would
be extradited in time for the trial, which is expected to start in
the first half of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Pfahls was not charged to stand trial as the court has no
address for the former official, who is believed to be somewhere in
Asia.

<HEADLINE> BA: Concorde Demand Still Steady  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BARR
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- British Airways insists that demand for seats on
its Concorde has not dropped off after the Air France crash a week
ago, despite a series of embarrassing problems since then with the
British fleet of supersonic jets.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways resumed its Concorde flights after a single
day's pause after the Air France flight crashed outside Paris on
July 25, killing 113 people.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, British Airways -- the only airline flying the
supersonic jets at the moment since the French fleet is grounded
for now -- said Concorde traffic was comparable in recent days to
the same time period in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Some days this year are worse, but the airline pointed to one
recent post-crash Concorde flight from New York that arrived with
82 passengers, compared to 32 on the same date a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's performance since the crash, however, hasn't helped
calm fears about its safety.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's flight to New York, with 33 of the 100 seats filled,
was more than two hours late departing. The first plane assigned to
the flight was pulled after mechanics decided more work was needed
on a recently replaced engine, and another Concorde was rolled out.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, emergency services were out on the runway to attend
to the landing of a Concorde at Heathrow after a report of a loud
bang in an engine.
</P>
<P>
   The following day, the first flight to New York was delayed by a
refueling problem. The day's second flight got only as far as
Gander, Newfoundland, where it made an emergency landing after
fumes that smelled like fuel got into the cabin.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways operates a single round-trip flight daily
between New York and London, which the airline said that is normal
in August.
</P>
<P>
   The French disaster was the first in 25 years of commercial
operations for Concorde. But because the Concorde makes far fewer
flights than most aircraft, that one crash gave it one of the worst
safety records for passenger aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Since there have only been 80,000 Concorde flights in a quarter
century, the aircraft now has a rate of 12.5 fatal incidents per
million flights, according to according to www.AirSafe.com, a Web
site that tracks safety data.
</P>
<P>
   The Boeing 727, with 46 fatal incidents since 1965, has a much
better safety rate -- 0.64 per million -- because the aircraft has
made nearly 72 million flights. The DC-9, which ranks second with
42 crashes, has a fatality rate of 0.72 per million flights.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways has one of the better safety records, at 0.32
fatal incidents per million flights, compared to 1.19 per million
for Air France, according to AirSafe data. American Airlines has a
rate of 0.53 per million, Delta 0.30 per million and United 0.50
per million.

<HEADLINE> Polling firm sues Internet service providers over 'spamming' blacklist </HEADLINE>
By BEN DOBBIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - A leading Internet-based polling company
is suing America Online and a dozen other Internet service
providers for blocking correspondence with some 2.7 million of its
6.6 million online members.
</P>
<P>
   Harris Interactive Inc., which publishes the Harris poll, filed
suit in federal court late Monday seeking unspecified damages from
AOL, HotMail, Netscape and other providers that subscribe to the
''Realtime Blackhole List'' maintained by Mail Abuse Prevention
System (MAPS).
</P>
<P>
   The nonprofit California company was established to fight e-mail
abuse. Harris Interactive was added to the list for purportedly
sending unsolicited bulk e-mail or ''spam'' - an accusation the
market research company heatedly denies.
</P>
<P>
   The listing prompted service providers to block Harris
Interactive from corresponding with some 41 percent of members
served by those providers, the lawsuit alleges. The Rochester-based
company is also suing MAPS, based in Redwood City, Calif., and a
market research competitor, Incon Research of Norwalk, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ''Harris Interactive was sending mail to people who didn't want
it,'' said Kelly Thompson, the MAPS list's project manager, ''and
they refused to change their procedures so that that could not
happen.'' She declined to comment on the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Yesmail.com, a Chicago-based online marketer, won a
temporary restraining order preventing MAPS from placing Yesmail on
its list of spammers. The order was suspended after the two sides
agreed to try to negotiate a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Harris Interactive was initially listed in December, then placed
on probation and listed again in mid-July, Thompson said. ''Anybody
is free to send us a nomination, and once we receive it, we
investigate it ... as to whether that site should be listed,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris Interactive's chief executive, Gordon S. Black, alleged
that MAPS had acted on a complaint from Incon, a competitor ''whose
motivation to defame us appears to be based on our leadership in
the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris Interactive is not only a pioneer in market research on
the Internet but helped develop many of the polling industry's
privacy policies, Black said. ''Nobody in our business has more
stringent standards of conduct,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it sought restitution only after attempting in
vain to resolve the dispute through negotiations. The lawsuit
accuses the service providers of antitrust violations, commercial
disparagement and curtailing its ability to conduct business.
</P>
<P>
   Black called AOL's decision to block e-mails ''a particularly
egregious example of market abuse by an Internet giant,'' noting
that AOL owns Digital Marketing Systems, a research firm that is an
active competitor.
</P>
<P>
   Neither America Online nor any of its interactive brands use the
MAPS list, countered AOL spokesman Rich D'Amato. ''We are confident
that our spam-fighting techniques are entirely appropriate and that
this lawsuit against American Online has no merit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Denying that it sends unsolicited e-mail to attract new members
to its online panel, Harris Interactive maintains instead that
members can join the panel only after registering at the company's
site and 26 other recruiting sites.
</P>
<P>
   Harris Interactive said its 6.6 million registered parties are
surveyed on diverse issues ranging from online buying habits to
public policy. Rather than being quizzed over the telephone, people
now can call up a Web page e-mail message and fill out a
questionnaire.

<HEADLINE> Latest test results show no new signs of virus  </HEADLINE>
By DENISE LAVOIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. (AP) - No new cases of the West Nile-like strain
of the encephalitis virus have been found in the latest tests on
mosquitoes and birds in Connecticut, state environmental officials
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The virus was detected in mosquitoes collected from a Stamford
park on July 11. Tests on a crow found in a Stamford yard on July
23 - about a mile from where the mosquitoes were found - also
turned up positive for the virus.
</P>
<P>
   In the most recent round of testing, 10,253 mosquitoes were
tested from 43 sites across the state. All came out negative.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday, 148 birds had tested negative and results on
another 127 birds were pending. The only positive result came from
the bird found in Stamford.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore G. Andreadis, chief entomologist for the Connecticut
Agricultural Experiment Station, said Tuesday he expects the state
will get additional positive test results for West Nile in birds
and mosquitoes through the summer.
</P>
<P>
   He said the risk to humans is relatively low, but urged
residents to take steps to protect themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when the virus first surfaced in the region, it
killed seven people and sickened 62 others in New York. It killed
hundreds of birds in Connecticut, New York and New Jersey. No human
cases have been reported this year.
</P>
<P>
   The virus is most dangerous for children under 5, the elderly
and people with weakened immune systems. But most people who
contract it experience flu-like symptoms and never realize they
have been exposed to the virus.
</P>
<P>
   Encephalitis, an inflammation of the brain, has many different
causes. So far this year, 13 cases of encephalitis have been
reported in Connecticut. No evidence of West Nile infection has
been found in 12 of those cases; test results are pending on one
case.
</P>
<P>
   The state sprayed pesticide last week in sections of Stamford,
Darien and New Canaan after the infected mosquitoes were found.
</P>
<P>
   Environmental officials have repeatedly urged people to
eliminate mosquito breeding grounds by removing standing water
collected in gutters, flower pots, old tires and other items around
their home.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully, with the measures being taken - larviciding and
adulticiding (spraying pesticide) - hopefully that will prevent
this virus from amplifying too much,'' Andreadis said.
</P>
<P>
   Mosquitoes have been trapped weekly at 73 sites around the state
since June 1, then tested for both West Nile and Eastern Equine
Encephalitis.

<HEADLINE> Amnesty International checks alleged abuse at women's prison  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN CHRISTOFFERSEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - Amnesty International said Tuesday it
plans to ask its members around the world to call for a probe of
alleged abuses at Connecticut's only prison for women.
</P>
<P>
   The human rights group wants an investigation into allegations
of sexual abuse of inmates and other misconduct by prison staff at
York Correctional Institution in Niantic, said Christine Doyle,
research director of Amnesty International U.S.A. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The group also says prisoners have complained that male guards
do pat-down searches of the female inmates and are present when
those inmates undress or shower.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to do a specific action targeting York,'' Doyle
said. ''For us to target a specific institution is always
serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty has received the allegations of sexual abuse in the past
week, Doyle said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We received a few startling cases,'' Doyle said. ''Now we're
just trying to do research into it to see if they're credible.''
</P>
<P>
   Correction Department spokeswoman Christina Polce said the
agency is not aware of any recent claims of sexual abuse at York,
but would investigate. ''We take all allegations seriously,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Amnesty also has received ''dozens'' of complaints of male
officers conducting pat-downs or watching nude prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you can have male officers in the same room with naked
female inmates we consider that a serious human rights abuse,''
Doyle said. ''We outright condemn it and call for an end to that
practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Polce said the department cannot assign correctional officers to
a prison based on gender.
</P>
<P>
   ''The responsibilities of a correctional employee are not gender
specific,'' Polce said. ''We should not discriminate against an
employee based on gender.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Kelley, a union steward at York, said correctional
officers do not stand guard while inmates shower or undress. He
said there are no open showers at the prison.
</P>
<P>
   Male officers do not strip-search female prisoners, except in an
emergency, and pat searches are done in the open, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And sexual misconduct can occur no matter who's guarding whom,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The gender of the officer and the gender of the inmate doesn't
come into play,'' Kelley said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mark Ryan, an activist in Hamden, said an officer
aggressively searched his wife, who is an inmate at York.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said to her, 'I can do this all day because I'm a
corrections officer,''' Ryan said. ''To her it's very upsetting.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the abuse reports are older, but Amnesty wants to see
how they were handled, Doyle said.
</P>
<P>
   In April, prison worker John E. Palladino, 43, was convicted of
sexually assaulting a female inmate at York. It is illegal for
staff to have sex with inmates, even if it is consensual.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut is one of only six states that allows male guards to
conduct physical searches of female prisoners, Doyle said.
</P>
<P>
   Prison officials say the use of male guards at women's prisons
is common around the country.

<HEADLINE> US: Progress Made on Free Trade  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Negotiators from the United States and Jordan
made ''very substantial progress'' toward a free trade agreement
and will meet again in the fall to try and close a deal, U.S. Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   A free trade agreement would eliminate trade barriers between
the two countries over a period of years. The United States has
such agreements with Canada and Mexico, its partners in the North
American Free Trade Agreement, and with Israel, an agreement it
reached in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Barshefsky said from Amman that in meetings with Jordan's King
Abdullah II and his economic advisers, both sides narrowed
differences in a number of areas.
</P>
<P>
   ''The progress is sufficiently strong that I don't believe it
will require substantial new negotiations,'' she said in a video
conference with reporters in Washington after a luncheon meeting in
Amman with Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
   She said the two sides will meet in early fall, probably in
Washington. While she refused to predict whether a deal could be
closed then, she said: ''The president and the king would both like
to get this done as quickly as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton announced during the king's visit to
Washington in June that the two countries had agreed to negotiate a
free trade agreement to boost economic contacts. The Clinton
administration considers Jordan critical to achieving an overall
Middle East peace settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ''A strong, stable Jordan is very important for peace in the
Middle East,'' Barshefsky told reporters Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Barshefsky said the negotiations with Jordan were based on the
outline of the deal reached with Israel, but it must be updated in
such areas as electronic commerce, which did not exist 15 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan's official Petra news agency said Abdullah expressed hope
that a free trade agreement with the United States would boost
foreign investment in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hope that this agreement will give a big opportunity for
international firms to invest in Jordan and to benefit from its
human resources and economic and geographic advantages,'' Abdullah
said, according to Petra.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Prime Minister Mohammad Halayqah predicted a free trade
agreement will be reached in September.
</P>
<P>
   Since ascending to the throne in 1999 after the death of his
father, King Hussein, Abdullah has been pushing various reforms to
Jordan's economy in an effort to attract foreign investment
including seeking membership in the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   A free trade agreement with Jordan would have to be approved by
Congress. Administration officials said key Republicans and
Democrats in Congress are being kept informed on the progress of
negotiations to ensure strong support for any final agreement.

<HEADLINE> Man indicted for criminally negligent homicide in auto death of police officer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A Staten Island man involved in a high-speed
police chase that ended in an officer's death, was indicted Tuesday
on charges including criminally negligent homicide.
</P>
<P>
   Officer John Kelly, 31, an eight-year veteran of the force,
pulled over Guido Tritto, 43, for speeding along the Staten Island
Expressway, on July 17. When Kelly got out of his car, Tritto sped
off on his motorcycle. Kelly chased Tritto for more than a mile and
then lost control of his unmarked cruiser, smashing into a
telephone pole.
</P>
<P>
   He was pronounced dead shortly afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Tritto fled the scene and was arrested the following day.
</P>
<P>
   ''Officer Kelly died in the line of duty, doing what he did
best, protecting our city. For so many reasons he is a hero. May
justice be served,'' said Staten Island District Attorney William
L. Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   Tritto is scheduled to be arraigned next week.

<HEADLINE> No death penalty for 19-year-old accused of killing his grandmother </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FREEHOLD, N.J. (AP) - Citing the family's wishes, prosecutors
won't seek the death penalty against a teen-ager accused of killing
his own grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon Cowser, 19, of Ocean Township, is accused of murder,
felony murder, robbery, conspiracy and other charges in the Nov. 30
slaying of Mattie Belle Chapman, 77, of Neptune.
</P>
<P>
   Telling her he needed a ride, Cowser allegedly lured Chapman
from her apartment, strangled her and submerged her in a creek to
make sure she was dead.
</P>
<P>
   Then, with the help of Nathaniel Burkard, he stole $3,300 from
her bank account and went on a spending spree, prosecutors say.
</P>
<P>
   Burkard, 19, of Asbury Park pleaded innocent Monday during brief
arraignments before Superior Court Judge James A. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Monmouth County Prosecutor John Kaye met with members of the
family ''as a supplement to our internal review of the case by the
(prosecutor's) Homicide Review Committee and the family position
was clearly opposed to the death penalty,'' said Second Assistant
Prosecutor Robert Honecker.
</P>
<P>
   Chapman loved her grandson and supported him even when he got
into trouble. Members of her church, Good Hope Baptist Church in
Asbury Park, have urged Kaye not to seek the death penalty because
she would not have wanted it, according to Theodore V. Fishman, a
public defender.

<HEADLINE> Judge blocks use of uncertified teachers at troubled schools  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A state Supreme Court justice barred the Board
of Education Tuesday from hiring or assigning uncertified teachers
in the city's poorly performing schools for the upcoming school
year.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Gloria C. Aronin issued the temporary restraining order
after Education Commissioner Richard Mills sued the city board,
alleging it had violated his order to comply with a new rules
requiring that after September 1999, new teachers at the troubled
schools had to be certified. A hearing was set for Aug. 15.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in Brooklyn, follows months of negotiations
between Mills and New York City Schools Chancellor Harold Levy, who
has said he was having difficulty staffing those schools with
certified teachers as required by the Board of Regents.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 600 uncertified teachers were hired to work last
year at 99 city schools on the state's ''registration review'' list
of poorly performing schools. Mills warned Monday that the state
would take legal steps to ensure that ''students that have some of
the greatest educational needs in the city and state have highly
qualified, certified teachers.''
</P>
<P>
   School officials argued Tuesday that Mills should give them more
time to either reassign uncertified teachers or certify them
through an accelerated certification program approved by the Board
of Regents last month. Deputy Chancellor David Klasfeld called the
suit ''premature.''
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't take issue with the commissioner's order,'' Klasfeld
said. ''I think we do take issue with him going to court.''
</P>
<P>
   In an April letter to Mills, Levy said one problem he faces is
that the city board ''pays less than the market wage rate that is
necessary in this part of the state to attract an adequate pool of
certified candidates.''

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Taking White Farmers' Land  </HEADLINE>
By ANGUS SHAW
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- In a massive land seizure, Zimbabwe's
government has confirmed plans to take more than half of all the
white-owned farming land in the country without paying for it and
redistribute it to 500,000 poor black families.
</P>
<P>
   The government had already said it would confiscate 804 farms
from Zimbabwe's white minority. But in a statement late Monday,
Vice President Joseph Msika announced a sharp increase in the
total, saying more than 3,000 farms will be resettled.
</P>
<P>
   The seizure plan is the latest episode in a six-month siege of
white farmers' property in Zimbabwe, where the tiny white minority
owns about a third of the productive land. Ensuring political
violence has claimed at least 31 lives, mostly opposition
supporters and white farmers.
</P>
<P>
   In February, government-backed squatters started occupying more
than 1,600 white farms, trapping some white farmers in their homes
and attacking others. President Robert Mugabe called the
occupations a legitimate protest against unfair ownership of land,
though opposition leaders said he was just trying to boost his
support among landless blacks in advance of parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
   The latest seizure plan was sketched out Tuesday by a top
official. He said that the army will be called in to help move the
landless black families onto the confiscated lands before the rainy
season in November. Procedures to nationalize the first 211 farms
will start by the end of the week, preparing the way for
resettlement of an initial group of 37,000 families, Local
Government Minister Ignatius Chombo said.
</P>
<P>
   With the expanded seizure, the government now plans to take 12
million of the 19 million acres owned by whites, Msika said. He
said the government will use a recent law allowing it to take
private property without compensation.
</P>
<P>
   White farmers have expressed shock at the plan, first reported
by government radio on Sunday. Farmers' leaders held crisis
meetings Tuesday to prepare a response, but they had no immediate
comment.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers' silence was in part a reflection of the massive
confusion here over the government's intentions.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night's announcement followed two days of hazy accounts
in state media, which first reported the escalation in land
seizures and then suddenly backed off. Earlier, the government said
it was beginning immediate resettlement on nationalized land on
July 15 but none has occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the uncertainty, it remained unclear how the
government could accomplish the resettlement.
</P>
<P>
   The 40,000-strong Zimbabwe army, which is supposed to help, has
11,000 of its best troops backing the Congolese president in his
nation's two-year civil war. And military officials admitted
earlier this year that some troops were on forced leave to cut
costs and that the army's transport capacity was only about 200
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Chombo expressed confidence that the army has the ability to
pull off the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has the vehicles needed to move people from one point to
the other. It will also establish a communications center to ensure
decisions are made fast and are implemented,'' he said in the
government-run Herald newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe's political problems have also thrown the country's
agriculture-based economy into turmoil. The farms disruptions by
violent occupiers have cut the nation's wheat and tobacco
production, and white leaders warn that further land confiscations
without carefully planned resettlement on productive farms will
likely trigger food shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe's largest labor group said Tuesday that it will go
ahead with a nationwide strike planned for Wednesday to protest the
land seizures and political violence, but said it will shorten the
shutdown to one day instead of three to avoid damaging the already
faltering economy. The Commercial Farmers' Union, which represents
the country's 4,000 white farmers, has said it will join the
strike.
</P>
<P>
   The farmer's union said it received reports that the militants
occupying farms -- including armed veterans of the bush war that
ended white rule here in 1980 -- have been instructed by Mugabe's
government to step up intimidation on farms whose owners join the
strike.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 85; Nasdaq Slips 81  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- New economic reports calmed Wall Street's
inflation fears Tuesday, sending blue chip stocks higher. But
technology stocks dropped amid profit-taking from Monday's rally.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks of health care and utility companies -- issues investors
usually turn to during economic uncertainty-- enjoyed broad gains.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 84.97 to 10,606.95.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index fell 81.47 to 3,685.52, giving back
most of its 103.99-point advance on Monday. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index rose 7.27 to 1,438.10.
</P>
<P>
   Investors found comfort in three economic reports released
Tuesday -- all eased inflation worries and fears that the Federal
Reserve will raise interest rates when its policy-making Open
Market Committee meets Aug. 22. The inflation-wary Fed has already
pushed rates higher six times over the past 13 months.
</P>
<P>
   ''We got some salutary news,'' said David Orr, chief economist
at First Union Capital Markets Group in Charlotte, N.C., ''It
showed the economy was not too hot, nor too cold.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first report, the National Association of Purchasing
Management said activity in the nation's industrial sector was
unchanged in July. Analysts had expected a small increase.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported construction
spending fell 1.7 percent in June. Analysts had also forecast a
small increase in that figure.
</P>
<P>
   A third report found stronger-than-expected consumer spending
during June, and that the gain outstripped American workers' income
gains. But investors looked past that sign of economic strength
because the Commerce Department report also found that the prices
Americans pay for goods overall were unchanged.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that personal spending rose faster than personal
incomes did not bother the market,'' said Alfred E. Goldman,
director of market analysts at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis.
''Spending is good as long as we are not seeing an increase in
prices nor outspending supply,'' Goldman said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Dow with its economy-sensitive stocks got some
encouragement from the purchasing management report, which showed
the economy is slowing to healthy levels.
</P>
<P>
   Big gainers on the Dow included The Walt Disney Co., up $1.312
at $40, and Coca-Cola, up $1.562 at $62.875. Analysts upgraded
Disney partly on the strength of its ABC television show ''Who
Wants To Be A Millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Every major pharmaceutical company got healthier, including
Bristol-Myers Squibb, up $2.75 at $52.25 and Pfizer, up $2.625 at
$45.75.
</P>
<P>
   HMO stocks rallied, led by Cigna up $1.375 at $101.25, and
WellPoint Health Networks, up $2.50 at $89.688. Cigna's
second-quarter earnings, released after the market closed, topped
Wall Street estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Duke Energy, up $1.625 at $63.313, was one of the big gainers
among utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Internet and telecommunications stocks pulled the Nasdaq lower.
Among them were Cisco, off $2.25 at $63.188, and Worldcom, down $1
at $38.063.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a nervous moody market that is approaching new growth
stocks in a tentative fashion-- up one day, down the next,'' Goldman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 7-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where composite volume came to 1.11
billion shares, down from Monday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was down 2.87 to 497.77.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 2.37 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 0.70 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.32 percent, and France's CAC-40 was
down 0.06 percent.

<HEADLINE> Engine Makers Accused on Pollution  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- State officials and environmentalists are
complaining that truck engine manufacturers are trying to renege on
part of a much ballyhooed 1998 consent agreement with the Justice
Department to curtail pollution from large trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints came as the Environmental Protection Agency
issued a formal regulation Tuesday on the first phase of a
two-stage program announced last year to cut truck pollution.
</P>
<P>
   The final EPA rule gives engine manufacturers until 2007, an
additional three years, to comply with a provision that would
require them to test truck engines under actual driving conditions
when determining if they comply with emission standards.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, six truck manufacturers, which together account for
nearly 95 percent of all diesel truck engines sold, promised in
1998 as part of a $1 billion consent agreement to design pre-sale
emissions test procedures to take into account actual highway
driving conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Attempts were unsuccessful Tuesday to reach officials at any of
the six engine manufacturing companies.
</P>
<P>
   The consent agreement stemmed from EPA findings that the
manufacturers for years had installed devices that allowed trucks
to pass the pre-sale tests, but then exceed pollution requirements
during actual highway driving.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturers as part of the agreement said they would
remove the devices during overhaul and that is being done.
</P>
<P>
   But the manufacturers also promised to have the more realistic
pre-sale emissions testing procedures in place by 2002 under the
consent agreement. A proposed EPA rule announced last fall called
for all manufacturers to have the new test procedures in place by
2004.
</P>
<P>
   But the final rule issued Tuesday extends the deadline until
2007. While the rule does not affect the consent agreement, the
extension could give manufacturers ammunition to argue for a change
in the agreement as well, some environmentalists fear.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now the companies are pressing their case at the Justice
Department'' to get a similar extension as part of the consent
agreement, said Frank O'Donnell, who has followed the issue for
Clean Air Trust, an environmental advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Perciasepe, head of the EPA's air pollution office, said
that the decision to give manufacturers until 2007 to put in place
the new test procedures won't affect emission reductions.
</P>
<P>
   ''The bottom line is, the rule is a 40 percent reduction in
nitrogen oxide emissions from diesel engines,'' said Perciasepe in
an interview. He said the tougher emission standards the EPA is
proposing for 2007 will require companies to conduct more stringent
pre-sale engine tests.
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturers have complained to the EPA and Justice
Department that they can't meet the requirement for the more
stringent testing procedures by 2002 and 2004, especially under
driving conditions in hot or cold weather or at higher altitudes.
</P>
<P>
   State air pollution control officials also have complained about
the manufacturers' attempt to relax the requirements under the 1998
consent decree, which at the time was hailed by EPA and Justice
officials as one of the most important environmental enforcement
victories achieved by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're worried if manufacturers once again break their consent
decrees and emit far more (pollution) than allowed, it could
acerbate our ability to meet federal health based (air quality)
standards,'' said Bill Becker, executive director of the
Association of State and Territorial Air Pollution Administrators.
</P>
<P>
   Becker wrote to Justice and EPA officials this week urging that
the manufacturers' requests for extensions on the test procedure
requirements be rejected.
</P>
<P>
   ''We absolutely cannot afford any backsliding,'' wrote Becker.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, the EPA issued its final rule giving the
manufacturers an additional three years to comply with the new
testing requirements. Justice has yet to make a decision on whether
to agree to changes in the consent agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The companies that signed the 1998 consent agreement were Mack
Trucks Inc., Cummins Engine Co., Detroit Diesel Corp., Navistar
International Transportation Co., Caterpillar Inc., Renault and
Volvo Truck Corp. Renault and Volvo truck companies have since
merged.

<HEADLINE> USDA To Give Farmers Sugar  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping to boost depressed sugar prices, the
Agriculture Department announced plans Tuesday to give
government-held sugar to farmers who agree to plow under some of
this year's crop.
</P>
<P>
   The program also is intended to discourage farmers from
forfeiting to the government some 1.4 million tons of sugar that
are being held under federal marketing loans.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department currently holds about 174,000 tons of
sugar left over from the 1999 crop -- the equivalent of 2 percent of
this year's projected production. The amount of sugar available for
USDA to give to farmers is expected to increase as farmers forfeit
some of the stocks that are now under loan.
</P>
<P>
   Giving the surplus to farmers to entice them to destroy part of
this year's crop will save the government on monthly storage costs,
currently about $2 a ton, USDA officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're optimistic that it will get a significant amount of
acreage out of production and restore balance to the U.S. market,''
said Jack Roney, an economist for the American Sugar Alliance, a
growers' group.
</P>
<P>
   USDA is unsure what the impact will be on production and prices,
said Mary Beth Schultheis, a spokeswoman for Agriculture Secretary
Dan Glickman.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will depend on producers' interest in enrolling in the
program,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers would not take possession of the sugar itself but would
instead receive a ''payment-in-kind'' certificate that they could
redeem for cash.
</P>
<P>
   By law, no producer can receive more than $20,000 each, the
equivalent of 15 acres of sugar beets, which is about 7 percent of
the average farmer's production.
</P>
<P>
   Wholesale sugar prices are down 23 percent this year because of
heavy domestic production and a surge in imports. Some farmers
switched to sugar beets in recent years when prices for corn and
other crops dropped sharply.

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves New Diabetes Drug  </HEADLINE>
By PHIL GALEWITZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday
approved Bristol-Myers Squibb's new diabetes drug Glucovance, which
may help patients control their blood sugar better than some
existing pills.
</P>
<P>
   The approval comes at an opportune moment for Bristol-Myers,
which next month will lose patent protection on its top diabetes
drug, Glucophage. The pill, with $1.3 billion in sales last year,
is the company's top selling medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Glucovance, which is a combination of Glucophage and a generic
diabetes pill Metformin, is intended as a therapy for patients with
Type 2 or adult onset diabetes. Analysts estimate Glucovance could
generate annual sales of at least $900 million.
</P>
<P>
   A Bristol-Myers-funded study of 800 patients, presented at the
American Diabetes Association meeting in June, found that
Glucovance worked better at reducing patients blood sugar than
either Glucophage or Metformin alone.
</P>
<P>
   The company did not conduct any tests of Glucovance against two
newer diabetes drugs-- SmithKline Beecham's Avandia and Eli Lilly's
Actos. Lilly sells Actos in partnership with Japanese firm Takeda
Pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   Over two-thirds of the patients in the study who received
Glucovance achieved ADA recommended blood sugar goals. ''Glucovance
represents a new approach to managing type 2 diabetes,'' said
Richard J. Lane, president of Bristol-Myers' worldwide medicines
group. ''It is our hope that the introduction of this novel agent
could change the treatment paradigm for the more than 15 million
patients in the U.S. with this condition.''
</P>
<P>
   The most common side effects of Glucovance are usually diarrhea,
nausea, and upset stomach. Less frequently, symptoms of
hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) such as lightheadedness, dizziness,
shakiness, or hunger may occur.
</P>
<P>
   In rare cases, Glucovance may cause lactic acidosis, which can
be fatal in up to half of the cases. Lactic acidosis occurs mainly
in people whose kidneys are not functioning properly. Patients
should not take the drug if they have kidney problems, the company
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bristol-Myers' research pipeline has been under increased
scrutiny since the company in April was forced to delay by at least
a year its launch of a new hypertension drug called Vanlev. The FDA
identified some safety problems during its review of the drug.
Vanlev had been heavily promoted and had been seen as a potential
$2 billion-a-year drug for Bristol-Myers.
</P>
<P>
   The company also faces a patent challenge on its top cancer
drug, Taxol.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Bristol-Myers rose $2.75 to $52.25 on Tuesday on the
New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Bishop Suspect Attacked in Jail  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GUATEMALA CITY, Guatemala (AP) -- An army captain accused of
killing a Roman Catholic bishop who was a vocal human rights
campaigner was attacked and stabbed in the jail, officials said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Two people attacked Byron Lima Oliva late Monday, stabbing the
army captain in the back, said prison director Basilio Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Lima Oliva, a karate expert who was also trained in the
Guatemalan military, fought back and wounded his two attackers, who
had to be hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez said officials were investigating whether the attack
was an assassination attempt or a common prison fight.
</P>
<P>
   Lima Oliva and his father, retired Col. Disrael Lima Estrada,
along with Jose Obdulio Villanueva, a former presidential guard,
are accused of killing Bishop Juan Jose Gerardi.
</P>
<P>
   Gerardi, the head of the Roman Catholic Church's human rights
office, was clubbed to death April 26, 1998, at his seminary. The
killing came two days after he released a major report blaming the
military for most of the civilian deaths and human rights abuses
committed in Guatemala's 36-year civil war, which ended in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Democrats say if Torricelli can't stop McGreevey, no one can  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - U.S. Sen. Robert Torricelli has a national
reputation as his party's money man and Clinton defender. Jim
McGreevey is the local glad-hander whose network of union leaders,
party operatives and other supporters scared away the senator from
making a run for governor.
</P>
<P>
   If McGreevey's candidacy is so strong it blocked Torricelli,
Democrats say others don't have a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Bob Torricelli's candidacy can't take off, Bob Torricelli
who some people were calling the 800-pound gorilla, how do the
other 125-pound gorillas take off? It's just not going to happen,''
state chairman Tom Giblin said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   McGreevey has worked to build his campaign for governor since
his narrow loss to Republican Gov. Christie Whitman in 1997.
Whitman is barred from seeking a third term.
</P>
<P>
   The Woodbridge Township mayor appeared to be the party's
presumptive nominee until Torricelli started soliciting support.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago Torricelli admitted his ambitions to leave
Washington for Trenton.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday he withdrew, citing in part McGreevey's support.
Torricelli's announcement came hours after McGreevey garnered
public endorsements from 30 elected Democrats, including Newark
Mayor Sharpe James.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday afternoon McGreevey was in Jersey City where he
collected endorsements from U.S. Rep. Bob Menendez and several
Hudson County officials.
</P>
<P>
   McGreevey has a Statehouse news conference scheduled for
Wednesday where he plans to announce more endorsements from county
Democratic organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ''For the past six years we have been working real hard, in fact
daily, to build a broad-based coalition,'' McGreevey said. ''On an
ongoing basis, I have worked to forge relationships, in fact
friendships.''
</P>
<P>
   Those relationships now show in the form of support from across
the state, McGreevey said.
</P>
<P>
   No one else is as good at building those relationships, what
politicians call ''retail politics'', Giblin said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He went to their weddings, their wakes, their parties,''
Giblin said.
</P>
<P>
   And right now no other candidate is doing that, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just don't see it. Everybody knows Bob Torricelli is one of
the top three or four fund-raisers in the country and all he brings
to the party. And still the support is there for McGreevey,''
Giblin said.
</P>
<P>
   But not all Democrats are buying that party line.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think the electoral process was meant to be a
coronation,'' said Walter Fields, a Democratic consultant. ''If we
are simply going to have this process of anointment, then we might
as well eliminate the primaries. They're meaningless.''
</P>
<P>
   Fields, who once headed the state chapter of the NAACP, said
Democrats should be worrying about more than just collecting
support from party bosses.
</P>
<P>
   Residents, voters and rank-and-file party members need to be
included and their concerns addressed by a candidate, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the critical question we should be asking: What is this
candidate saying?'' Fields said.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Underscores Statehood  </HEADLINE>
By HASSAN MESTAHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
insisted in an interview published Tuesday that he will ''never,
never'' retreat on his intention to unilaterally declare a
Palestinian state in September.
</P>
<P>
   The interview was published in the Saudi Gazette newspaper as
Arafat arrived in Algeria for talks with Algerian President
Abdelaziz Bouteflika, saying he did not consider the Camp David
summit a failure and urging Russia to play a role in future
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The interview, conducted Friday, was the first time since the
collapse of the Camp David summit that Arafat reiterated that he
would unilaterally declare an independent state on Sept. 13 if no
deal with Israel is ironed out.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether he had changed his timetable, Arafat was quoted as
saying: ''Never, never. There is no retreat on the fixed timetable
of the declaration of the state. It will be declared on the fixed
time, which is September 13, God willing, regardless of those who
agree or disagree.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who sponsored the Camp David talks, threatened Friday
that Washington would review its relationship with the Palestinians
if Arafat presses ahead with plans to declare a state.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat said Israeli ''intransigence'' was to blame for the
failure of the Camp David talks last month and accused the Israeli
government of refusing to come to terms with key issues, including
the status of Jerusalem, according to APS, the official Algerian
news agency.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat met Bouteflika in Annaba, 370 miles east of Algiers, as
part of a diplomatic tour of Arab capitals in search of support for
his side in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Arafat traveled to Khartoum, capital of Sudan, and was
expected to travel later in the week to Egypt. He has also visited
France, Saudi Arabia and other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat will visit Moscow on Aug. 10-12 and may seek to persuade
Russia to take a more active role in the Mideast peace process,
news reports said.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat may meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but no
definite schedule has been made, the ITAR-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
   The main stumbling block between Israel and the Palestinians in
reaching a permanent peace accord remains the status of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians demand sovereignty over traditionally Arab east
Jerusalem, which Israel captured from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
war. Israel has long insisted that Jerusalem remain united under
exclusive Israeli sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   In Riyadh, King Fahd told U.S. Assistant Secretary of State
Edward Walker that it is impossible to have peace in the Middle
East if Israel does not leave all Arab lands it captured,
particularly east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Walker visited Saudi Arabia as part of a two-week tour expected
to include 14 Middle East nations in a bid to enlist support for
the U.S. argument that the Palestinians need to make concessions in
their talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   An official Saudi source speaking on condition of anonymity said
Fahd told Walker that the eastern part of Jerusalem must become the
capital of a Palestinian state.

<HEADLINE> Union Authorizes Strike on Verizon  </HEADLINE>
By GREG TOPPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The union representing more than 72,000
customer service workers for Verizon Communications in 12
Northeastern states authorized its president to call a strike this
weekend if a settlement isn't reached in contract talks.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon workers from Maine to Virginia are negotiating for
higher pay, better benefits and improved working conditions at the
telecommunications giant's facilities. Union negotiators also are
trying to organize Verizon's wireless workers.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon was created in June by the merger of Bell Atlantic and
GTE. Its wireless operation is its fastest growing division. The
wireless operation is a separate company run through a joint
venture with Vodafone AirTouch.
</P>
<P>
   Talks continued Tuesday between Verizon, the Communications
Workers of America and the International Brotherhood of Electrical
Workers. The CWA represents about 72,500 Verizon workers, and the
IBEW represents 12,000 others.
</P>
<P>
   CWA spokesman Jeff Miller said the unions would strike together
if an agreement can't be reached by 12:01 a.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The CWA on Tuesday said its executive board voted Monday night
to give President Morton Bahr authority to call a strike if the
deadline passes without an agreement. Last week, CWA workers
approved the strike authorization, the first step in a three-step
procedure for calling a strike. All that remains is for Bahr to set
the strike date.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the dispute was generated by the unions' call for access
by union members to new jobs in the wireless operation.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said differences in wages and benefits between union and
nonunion workers are significant. He said the pay scale for
union-covered service representatives tops out at $44,400, while
workers doing similar jobs in the wireless operation make only
$33,000.
</P>
<P>
   The nonunion workers also have fewer choices for health care,
must contribute to their health plan premium and don't enjoy a
pension.
</P>
<P>
   The nonunion workers, he said, also receive a smaller employer
contribution to their 401(k) plan.
</P>
<P>
   Although the union is demanding concessions to make it easier to
organize at the wireless company, Verizon spokesman Steve Marcus
said the union doesn't need them to conduct an organizing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He said the company needs flexibility deciding what is pays
wireless workers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're committed to fair compensation for our workers, but it's
essential that we be able to compete and succeed in the face of
rapid changes and expanding competition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   An impasse early Sunday could send operators and technicians to
the picket lines and leave 25 million homes and businesses without
help setting up phone services, repairing or installing lines or
figuring out their telephone bills.
</P>
<P>
   Verizon workers in 12 states and the District of Columbia are
represented. The states covered: Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont,
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Delaware,
Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia.

<HEADLINE> Early Israel Elections Inevitable  </HEADLINE>
By JACK KATZENELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Early elections over a peace treaty with the
Palestinians are inevitable, Ehud Barak's supporters and detractors
alike said Tuesday, a day after the Israeli prime minister's
embarrassing double defeat in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Barak's candidate for president, Nobel laureate
Shimon Peres, was defeated in an upset vote in parliament, and just
a few hours later the hawkish opposition won one no-confidence vote
on Barak's peace policies and tied a second.
</P>
<P>
   The parliamentary challenges fell short of toppling the
government, but made it painfully clear to Barak, elected by a
landslide just 15 months ago, that he will be unable to pass a
hotly contested peace treaty with the Palestinians in this Knesset.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Israel's peace camp said Barak should use the
three-month Knesset recess to try to conclude a deal with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, then call elections, turning the
vote into a peace referendum.
</P>
<P>
   ''During these three months, the prime minister has to make a
heroic attempt to complete the negotiations with the Palestinians
... and to initiate early elections,'' said Yossi Sarid, leader of
the dovish Meretz party, a partner in the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Israel television, Barak said he did not
anticipate early elections, and that he intended on rebuilding his
government in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The next regularly scheduled elections are in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has said there will be no letup in the drive for an
agreement, and Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Tuesday that
both sides are in daily contact, even after July's Mideast summit
at Camp David ended inconclusively.
</P>
<P>
   Erekat said Camp David was not a failure, and that both sides
broke new ground. At the U.S. presidential retreat, Israel offered
the Palestinians limited sovereignty over parts of Jerusalem and
land swaps in exchange for some West Bank territory. Arafat
insisted on full sovereignty over all of traditionally Arab east
Jerusalem, and the talks broke off.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians are worried by Barak's domestic difficulties,
said Nabil Amr, a Palestinian Cabinet minister. ''If he wastes more
time with hesitation, he will have no agreement and no
government,'' Amr told Al-Jazeera television.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, who was in Algeria and was also traveling to Sudan as
part of ongoing trips to push the Palestinian cause, said Tuesday
he is determined to declare a Palestinian state on Sept. 13, the
treaty deadline, even if no agreement is reached.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Palestinian officials have hinted that a delay is
possible. President Clinton said last week that he opposed any
unilateral moves and warned of repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   If peace talks fail, Barak would have little difficulty
restoring his broad-based coalition. Three hawkish factions that
defected ahead of Camp David in protest over anticipated
concessions would likely be eager to return to the government.
</P>
<P>
   However, as long as there is a real possibility for a peace
agreement with the Palestinians, Barak will have difficulty
mustering a majority in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's votes in parliament showed that the alliance between
the right wing, the religious parties and Russian immigrants, which
ruled the country under former right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, has re-emerged.
</P>
<P>
   The day began with Peres' humiliating defeat in the presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
   No less ominous for Barak were two no-confidence votes later
Monday that made it clear no peace agreement will be passed by the
present parliament.
</P>
<P>
   In the first ballot, on Camp David, the government tied 50-50,
with eight abstention. In the second, over Barak's proposals to
give the Palestinians a say in running Jerusalem, the opposition
won 53-48, with seven abstentions. The government did not fall
because 61 votes are needed to pass no-confidence motions.
</P>
<P>
   Barak faces another difficult day Wednesday when an opposition
bill to call early elections is expected to pass in a preliminary
vote. However, three more readings are required that could only
take place after the recess, in late October.
</P>
<P>
   Israel radio's political commentator, Hanan Kristall, said the
Knesset is tying Barak's hands. ''He can't do anything. He is a
totally lame duck,'' Kristall said.
</P>
<P>
   The defectors have urged Barak to form a so-called government of
national unity with the Likud. Barak's disgruntled foreign
minister, David Levy, who is considering leaving the government, is
also pressing Barak to bring in Likud.
</P>
<P>
   Likud chairman Ariel Sharon said a national consensus can be
achieved only if the prime minister agrees that Jerusalem remain
undivided under Israeli sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   ''He does not have a majority and I think we will have to go to
elections,'' Sharon told reporters.

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves ADD Drug  </HEADLINE>
By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The first single-dose form of the drug most
widely used to treat attention deficit disorder in children won
government approval Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Food and Drug Administration said it had approved Concerta
for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Between 4 percent and 12 percent of school-age children -- an
average of about 2.5 million, mostly boys -- are believed to have
ADHD. Symptoms include short attention span, impulsive behavior and
difficulty focusing and sitting still.
</P>
<P>
   Methylphenidate -- best known under the name Ritalin -- often is
prescribed to increase a child's alertness.
</P>
<P>
   But current forms of the drug require two or three doses daily,
often requiring youngsters to break up their schooldays with visits
to the nurse's office.
</P>
<P>
   The new drug lasts 12 hours, which will avoid in-school and
after-school dosing.
</P>
<P>
   Concerta was developed by Crescendo Pharmaceuticals Corp. and
will be manufactured and marketed by ALZA Corp. of Mountain View,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The new form of the drug will eliminate the stigma of taking a
drug in school and the problems of getting it to the school nurse
or interrupting after-school programs or practice, said Dan
Swisher, vice president of ALZA.
</P>
<P>
   ''It makes the condition private. It eliminates the
embarrassment for children,'' he said in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   Swisher said McNeill Consumer Healthcare is assisting in the
marketing of Concerta, which should be available in two weeks. He
said the price has not been determined but will be comparable to
other ADHD treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, people suffering from ADHD have problems following
instructions and paying attention. They may seem not to listen; be
disorganized; miss details; have trouble starting tasks, or
performing tasks that require planning or long-term effort; appear
to be easily distracted or forgetful. In many cases they seem
''hyper,'' being fidgety, impulsive and unable to wait their turn.
</P>
<P>
   Not all people with the disorder exhibit all the symptoms all
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the symptoms also are associated with youthful
rambunctiousness, which has raised questions whether today's
youngsters are being overdiagnosed and overdrugged.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the American Academy of Pediatrics issued in May
its first guidelines for ADHD, hoping to eliminate incorrect
diagnoses and ensure untreated children get the help they need.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines are for children 6 through 12. Most ADHD research
has involved that age group.
</P>
<P>
   Concerta is an extended-release formula in tablet form designed
to be taken in the morning before a child leaves for school.
</P>
<P>
   In clinical trials the most common side effects were headaches,
reported by 14 percent of patients. Less common were upper
respiratory tract infection and stomachache.

   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - A 2&AMP;frac12;-month-old baby boy died Tuesday
after police were called to his home by an adult who told them he
was not breathing. The cause was unknown.
</P>
<P>
   Elijah Luckett was pronounced dead at the scene at an apartment
on Pacific Avenue by representatives of the Atlantic County Medical
Examiner's office. An autopsy was scheduled for late Tuesday,
according to Sgt. Michael Tullio, a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   ''Right now, it's just a sudden death investigation. There's
nothing suspicious that we know of,'' Tullio said. ''Unless the
M.E. finds (signs of) trauma, which we don't have now, it's being
treated as a sudden death.''
</P>
<P>
   There were adults in the building at the time of the 12:30 p.m.
call, Tullio said. It wasn't immediately clear who lived in the
apartment with the child, he said.

<HEADLINE> Assault charge reduced against singer Tim McGraw but trial still looms </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) - A felony assault charge against
country singer Tim McGraw was reduced Tuesday but McGraw, singer
Kenny Chesney and McGraw's manager still face trial for an
altercation with sheriff's deputies following a concert in June.
</P>
<P>
   A trial date of Dec. 7 was set for the three, who now face
various misdemeanor charges and potential jail terms of up to a
year. The singers were represented by their attorney and did not
appear at the hearing in Orchard Park Town Court in suburban
Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Only McGraw had been charged with a felony following the
incident which began when Chesney allegedly took an unauthorized
ride on a police horse following his performance at the George
Strait Country Music Festival June 3.
</P>
<P>
   While Erie County Sheriff's deputies were trying to put an end
to Chesney's ride, McGraw allegedly came up from behind and grabbed
a deputy by the throat, Sheriff Patrick Gallivan said. Manager Mark
Russo is accused of joining in the scuffle.
</P>
<P>
   All three have denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to keep emphasizing that this was all due to a
misunderstanding,'' said Scott Siman, McGraw's manager in
Nashville. ''Kenny had permission to ride the horse.''
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Frank Clark's agreement to lessen the most
serious charge against McGraw to misdemeanor assault was made over
the objection of the sheriff, who has been angered by the singers'
antics since their arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not a funny thing,'' Gallivan said. ''It is not OK that
Faith Hill dresses up in uniform and takes away Tim McGraw in
handcuffs at a performance. It makes light of the situation. It's
not OK for Kenny Chesney to get on a horse and go on Jay Leno.''
</P>
<P>
   Singer Hill and McGraw are married. McGraw was nominated Tuesday
for three Country Music Association awards, including best
entertainer and best male vocalist. He and Hill, also up for top
entertainer, were nominated together for best vocal event for
''Let's Make Love.''
</P>
<P>
   The singers' attorney, Thomas Eoannou, said McGraw is
appreciative that the felony charge - which could have brought a
seven-year prison term - is gone.
</P>
<P>
   Siman in Nashville said McGraw has taken the arrest seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have refrained from commenting while other people have made
light of it. I think everybody in America is joking about it,''
Siman said, ''and we can't.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Chesney said the singer would have no comment.
</P>
<P>
   The incident began after Chesney received permission to sit on
one of the Mounted Division horses, which were used for security at
the concert, from the adult daughter of Capt. James Coyle, who
oversees the division.
</P>
<P>
   Gallivan said children are sometimes allowed to sit on the
horses but that Chesney was told he could not ride the horse. After
riding off, he ignored repeated orders by deputies to dismount, the
sheriff said.
</P>
<P>
   Eoannou did not rule out the possibility a settlement could come
in the case, but ''at this point it's scheduled to go to trial,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   McGraw, 33, of Brentwood, Tenn., is now charged with
third-degree assault, obstructing governmental administration,
menacing and resisting arrest. He is free on $2,500 bail.
</P>
<P>
   Chesney, 32, of Nashville, whose hits include ''How Forever
Feels,'' is charged with disorderly conduct and Russo, 44, of
Hendersonville, Tenn., is charged with disorderly conduct and
resisting arrest.

<HEADLINE> 51 Injured in Japan Factory Blast  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- A powerful explosion tore through a gunpowder
factory in western Japan Tuesday, injuring at least 51 area
residents and shattering windows in buildings up to a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those injured in the blast at Nihon Yushi Co.'s
gunpowder-making plant were hit by flying glass or other objects,
said Seiichi Tsuchida, a spokesman for the town of Taketoyo. None
of the injuries was life-threatening.
</P>
<P>
   The casualty toll in the 10:30 p.m. blast could have been higher
but the factory was not operating because of a summer holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said 150-foot flames shot up from a fire that engulfed
the factory, destroying several of its buildings, according to
Tsuchida. The factory was located in Aichi prefecture (state),
about 155 miles west of Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   ''At first I thought it was a big earthquake,'' Tsuchida said of
the 10:30 p.m. blast. He said glass was shattered at a shop about
one mile away. Kyodo News agency reported that 161 homes were
damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said police were trying to determine the cause of the
blast.

<HEADLINE> FCC offers new 866 toll-free area code, which began Saturday  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The explosive demand for toll-free phone
numbers has prompted the Federal Communications Commission to
create a new area code, 866. It became effective Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   All long-distance carriers draw from the same pool of toll-free
numbers - overseen by the FCC. The pool would have exhausted by the
fall without the new exchange, said Paul LaPlante, a spokesman for
AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   The original toll-free area code, 800, was invented by AT&AMP;T
nearly 35 years ago. A second toll-free exchange, 888, was
introduced in March 1996, and then 877 debuted in April 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Each area code contains nearly 8 million valid phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ''We hardly envisioned revolutionizing the way business gets
done when we first introduced the service,'' said Roy Weber, a
research director for AT&AMP;T Labs who helped create toll-free
technology. ''Yet it has done just that, when you consider it has
spawned new industries like catalog shopping, and has become
synonymous with smart customer service for companies ranging from
the Fortune 500 to home-based businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   Toll-free service was designed to relieve the burden of
operators handling collect calls to businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, AT&AMP;T carried about 30 billion toll-free calls,
representing nearly 40 percent of all calls across its national
network.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, based in Basking Ridge, said 866 and 855 - the exchange
scheduled to go into service in November - should meet the
industry's need for new toll-free numbers until sometime in 2004.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   MURPHY, N.C. (AP) - A pet treat maker has voluntarily recalled
dog treats made from pig's ears, saying Monday the items may be
contaminated with salmonella.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina Prime Pet said pet owners can become ill by handling
the treats, then touching food or their own mouths without washing
their hands first.
</P>
<P>
   The treats are labeled ''Pig Ears Product Code 10102 - 100
Count'' or ''Smoked Pig Ears Product Code 10103 - 100 Count''
between April 16 and April 26. The ears are distributed in
Pennsylvania, Virginia, New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland and the
District of Columbia by Super Dog Pet Food Co.
</P>
<P>
   A federal Food and Drug Administration test was positive for
salmonella, while tests by three independent laboratories were
negative, Carolina Prime Pet said.
</P>
<P>
   Salmonella is an organism that can cause serious and sometimes
fatal infections in the very young or old, or in people who have
weakened immune systems. Healthy people may suffer fever, headache,
vomiting, nausea, abdominal pain or diarrhea.

landslide just 15 months ago, that he will be unable to pass a
hotly contested peace treaty with the Palestinians in this Knesset.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Israel's peace camp said Barak should use the
three-month Knesset recess to try to conclude a deal with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, then call elections, turning the
vote into a peace referendum.
</P>
<P>
   ''During these three months, the prime minister has to make a
heroic attempt to complete the negotiations with the Palestinians
... and to initiate early elections,'' said Yossi Sarid, leader of
the dovish Meretz party, a partner in the coalition.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with Israel television, Barak said he did not
anticipate early elections, and that he intended on rebuilding his
government in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The next regularly scheduled elections are in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has said there will be no letup in the drive for an
agreement, and Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat said Tuesday that
both sides are in daily contact, even after July's Mideast summit
at Camp David ended inconclusively.
</P>
<P>
   Erekat said Camp David was not a failure, and that both sides
broke new ground. At the U.S. presidential retreat, Israel offered
the Palestinians limited sovereignty over parts of Jerusalem and
land swaps in exchange for some West Bank territory. Arafat
insisted on full sovereignty over all of traditionally Arab east
Jerusalem, and the talks broke off.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians are worried by Barak's domestic difficulties,
said Nabil Amr, a Palestinian Cabinet minister. ''If he wastes more
time with hesitation, he will have no agreement and no
government,'' Amr told Al-Jazeera television.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, who was in Algeria and was also traveling to Sudan as
part of ongoing trips to push the Palestinian cause, said Tuesday
he is determined to declare a Palestinian state on Sept. 13, the
treaty deadline, even if no agreement is reached.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Palestinian officials have hinted that a delay is
possible. President Clinton said last week that he opposed any
unilateral moves and warned of repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   If peace talks fail, Barak would have little difficulty
restoring his broad-based coalition. Three hawkish factions that
defected ahead of Camp David in protest over anticipated
concessions would likely be eager to return to the government.
</P>
<P>
   However, as long as there is a real possibility for a peace
agreement with the Palestinians, Barak will have difficulty
mustering a majority in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's votes in parliament showed that the alliance between
the right wing, the religious parties and Russian immigrants, which
ruled the country under former right-wing Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, has re-emerged.
</P>
<P>
   The day began with Peres' humiliating defeat in the presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
   No less ominous for Barak were two no-confidence votes later
Monday that made it clear no peace agreement will be passed by the
present parliament.
</P>
<P>
   In the first ballot, on Camp David, the government tied 50-50,
with eight abstention. In the second, over Barak's proposals to
give the Palestinians a say in running Jerusalem, the opposition
won 53-48, with seven abstentions. The government did not fall
because 61 votes are needed to pass no-confidence motions.
</P>
<P>
   Barak faces another difficult day Wednesday when an opposition
bill to call early elections is expected to pass in a preliminary
vote. However, three more readings are required that could only
take place after the recess, in late October.
</P>
<P>
   Israel radio's political commentator, Hanan Kristall, said the
Knesset is tying Barak's hands. ''He can't do anything. He is a
totally lame duck,'' Kristall said.
</P>
<P>
   The defectors have urged Barak to form a so-called government of
national unity with the Likud. Barak's disgruntled foreign
minister, David Levy, who is considering leaving the government, is
also pressing Barak to bring in Likud.
</P>
<P>
   Likud chairman Ariel Sharon said a national consensus can be
achieved only if the prime minister agrees that Jerusalem remain
undivided under Israeli sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
   ''He does not have a majority and I think we will have to go to
elections,'' Sharon told reporters.

<HEADLINE> Early Israeli Elections Inevitable  </HEADLINE>
By JACK KATZENELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Early elections over a peace treaty with the
Palestinians are inevitable, Ehud Barak's supporters and detractors
alike said Tuesday, a day after the Israeli prime minister's
embarrassing double defeat in parliament.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Barak's candidate for president, Nobel laureate
Shimon Peres, was defeated in an upset vote in parliament, and just
a few hours later the hawkish opposition won one no-confidence vote
on Barak's peace policies and tied a second.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cinnaminson man pleads guilty to Medicaid fraud  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A Cinnaminson man pleaded guilty Tuesday to
charges that he defrauded the Medicaid Program by billing it for
substance abuse programs he never held.
</P>
<P>
   Tommie Murry, 41, pleaded guilty to conspiracy, theft by
deception and corporate misconduct, as well as two counts of
Medicaid fraud.
</P>
<P>
   He was charged with defrauding Medicaid of about $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   Murry had been employed as the executive director of The Excel
Center, a now defunct outpatient drug and alcohol treatment center
formerly located in Vineland. It provided services to many Medicaid
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Murry and The Excel Center submitted bills to Medicaid for
multiple sessions of group alcohol and drug therapy for Medicaid
patients. But the groups never took place, said John Smith, acting
insurance fraud prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the guilty plea, The Excel Center will be
fined $10,000 and will forfeit about $1.7 million in Medicaid
claims, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Murry faces up to five years in prison when he is sentenced Oct.
13.
</P>
<P>
   Murry has an unlisted phone number and could not be reached for
comment.

<HEADLINE> Media Empire Denies Talk of Sale  </HEADLINE>
By JIM HEINTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- The media holding company of beleaguered tycoon
Vladimir Gusinsky on Tuesday denied reports that the company may be
sold to the state-controlled natural gas monopoly Gazprom.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Media-Most, also accused the Kremlin of doing
''everything'' it could to create financial problems for the
company, which includes broadcast and print outlets that have been
critical of President Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, another mogul, Boris Berezovsky, said Tuesday he has
begun talks with the government on selling back his stock in
Russia's premier television network, ORT. Berezovsky controls a 49
percent stake in ORT; the state has a controlling interest.
</P>
<P>
   Observers said such deals could threaten media freedom by giving
the government greater control over the influential outlets.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky was jailed for four days in June after being arrested
on charges of cheating the state of some dlrs 10 million in a
privatization deal. Gusinsky and many observers saw the arrest as a
Kremlin attempt to crack down on independent-minded media. But the
case was abruptly dropped last month for lack of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Kommersant -- which is owned by Berezovsky, a
Gusinsky rival -- reported Tuesday that Media-Most and
Gazprom-Media, an arm of the gas company, held a meeting Monday
about selling Media-Most to the gas monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   ''All that is said in the story does not conform to reality,''
said a statement released by Media-Most.
</P>
<P>
   Gazprom already owns about 30 percent of Media-Most's NTV
television channel and holds 17-20 percent more of NTV's stock as
collateral for a loan. Gazprom, which also owns media outlets that
compete with Media-Most's, has been stepping up pressure on NTV in
recent months to settle its debts.
</P>
<P>
   The Media-Most statement lashed out at the Kremlin, which its
said ''has done everything in the past year to create additional
financial problems for the holding.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The main goal ... is to establish control over NTV and change
the leadership of the company and with them, it is understood, the
editorial politics,'' the statement said.''
</P>
<P>
   Gazprom-Media chief Alfred Kokh said talks were under way on
Media-Most's debts to the gas company, but said sale of the media
holding as a whole was not under discussion, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts say such a deal has long been under consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky announced plans recently to merge his media outlets
into a single holding that would help protect his political
interests. He said Tuesday that the holding could include his stake
in ORT if talks on selling his stock to the government fail,
Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
   ORT administrators could not be immediately reached for comment,
and the Kremlin press service said it had no information on the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Media-Most's flagship NTV television network is seen as
important to Russian democracy, as the only one of the country's
three major networks that is not state-controlled. ORT's coverage
of the government has been largely favorable.
</P>
<P>
   Gusinsky has been in Spain with his family since last week, and
has not commented publicly on the end of the probe against him.

<HEADLINE> Protests Break Out Over Chavez  </HEADLINE>
By TIMOTHY WARREN
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Supporters of President Hugo Chavez
and opposition backers exchanged blows and threw rocks and bottles
at each other Tuesday in clashes over results from last weekend's
elections.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez ordered in federal troops to southwestern Merida state to
quell the violence that left nine people injured after results
showed an incumbent governor from an opposition party there losing
to a pro-Chavez candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had to send troops ... because the governor tells us he's
not going to give up his government to the revolutionary
candidate,'' Chavez, who says he is leading a ''social revolution''
for Venezuela, told reporters in the capital, Caracas.
</P>
<P>
   New election results Tuesday gave the opposition fewer
governorships than previously announced, stirring disputes between
Chavez supporters and the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday's elections, Venezuelans voted for the president, the
legislature, governors, mayors and other officers to
''re-legitimize'' the overhauled political system created in a new
constitution pushed through by Chavez last year.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez won re-election handily with a 21-point lead over his
nearest challenger, former Zulia state Gov. Francisco Arias. His
coalition also won about 60 percent of the new 165-member
legislature.
</P>
<P>
   The revised results published Tuesday gave Chavez's leftist
Patriotic Pole coalition at least 14 of Venezuela's 23
governorships. Earlier results had given the opposition a slim
majority but the final count gave them only seven. The allegiance
of the remaining two governorship was unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the governorships were still in limbo Tuesday, however,
because candidates were disputing the results.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute in southwestern Merida state turned violent when
supporters of the incumbent governor, William Davila, clashed with
Chavez backers. The violence injured nine people and forced local
businesses to close, the state government said.
</P>
<P>
   Davila, who was way ahead in pre-election polls, held a close
lead over Chavez ally Florencio Porras as initial balloting came
in. But results released Tuesday showed Porras up by some 1,750
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Davila called the count ''a fraud,'' questioning why more than
9,500 votes have been declared invalid.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary-general of Davila's Action Democratic Party,
Timoteo Zambrano, pleaded with international election monitors to
stay in the country, saying ''it's not true that these elections
have been transparent.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Organization of American States, which sent an
observer team to Venezuela, said they did not detect any
irregularities but added they would withhold final judgment until
more information is available.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney general Javier Elechiguerra announced Tuesday his
office was investigating complaints of voting irregularities in
seven states.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez said Tuesday his coalition would continue fighting for
its candidates in disputed elections. ''We're consolidating our
revolution, and like any battle, we have to care for it up to the
last bit of territory,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his landslide victory, Chavez now faces a viable
opposition for the first time since he took office last year and
plowed through his ''social revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Chavez will have to negotiate and make deals to get his most
radical changes approved, since many require a two-thirds majority
in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In his victory speech, Chavez appealed to the Roman Catholic
Church, business leaders and the political opposition -- all of whom
he derided in his first 18 months in office -- to help get Venezuela
back on its feet.
</P>
<P>
   ''A balance of power has been restored. Now we have to see how
Chavez responds,'' newspaper editor Teodoro Petkoff said Monday on
a local radio show.

   AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) -- Left-hander Tony Saunders' rehabilitation
from a broken bone in his pitching arm was delayed on Tuesday when
his scheduled start for Class-A Charleston was postponed by rain.
</P>
<P>
   Saunders, of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, has been rescheduled to

   Saunders will start the first game and is slated to pitch two

</P>

<HEADLINE> Autopsy Done On Kansas State Player  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN, Kan. (AP) -- An autopsy was performed Tuesday to
determine the cause of death of Kansas State tackle Anthony Bates,
a university spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Dull, the university's sports information director, said
Tuesday he had no further information about the death of the
20-year-old from Tempe, Ariz. It wasn't known when autopsy results
would be available.
</P>
<P>
   Bates was driving near campus Monday when he suffered a
''medical condition,'' the university said without providing
details.
</P>
<P>
   His pickup truck crossed into the opposite lane and struck a
car, then continued south about 800 feet before hitting two parked
cars and coming to a stop, according to a Riley County police
report.
</P>
<P>
   The report said Bates was unconscious and taken to Mercy Health
Center, where he died at 3:18 p.m. A hospital spokesman said he
could provide no information, deferring to Kansas State.
</P>
<P>
   Bates, a 6-foot, 280-pound redshirt junior, was due to report
for practice on Thursday with other veteran players.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know that I speak for each and every member of this program
in expressing our pain, our compassion and our deep, deep sympathy
for Anthony's parents, relatives and friends who also are suffering
tremendously over the tragic passing of this very special young
man,'' Kansas State coach Bill Snyder said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Anthony, simply and honestly put, was a wonderful person;
caring, giving, unselfish and friendly. He was a man of character
and values. To say we hurt, to say we miss him, to say we love him
is dramatically understated. I ask all Wildcat fans to include
Anthony, his family and his teammates in their prayers during this
period of mourning.''
</P>
<P>
   Bates transferred to Kansas State from Phoenix Junior College
and was a redshirt last season.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was just perfect in every since of the word,'' Phoenix JC
assistant head coach Loren Dawson said. ''He was never in trouble
and was not only in class, but excelled in class. He wasn't
recruited hard by the bigger schools out of high school because of
his height, but when we got him, he was a difference-maker for us.
He was one of the best players we ever had. Nobody ever worked
harder.''
</P>
<P>
   The accident happened on the day newcomers reported to preseason
camp for the Wildcats, who are starting practice early to prepare
for their Aug. 26 opener against Iowa in the Eddie Robinson Classic
at Arrowhead Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   A management information systems major, Bates earned academic
honors on the Big 12 Conference Commissioner's Honor Roll in three
semesters.
</P>
<P>
   He was an all-state player at Mountain Pointe High School in
Phoenix, graduating in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Bates was an Eagle Scout and a member of the National Honor
Society and Fellowship of Christian Athletes. He is survived by his
parents, Allen and Sharon.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for a memorial service were pending.

<HEADLINE> Bus crash on West 34th Street leaves at least three seriously injured </HEADLINE>
By LUKAS I. ALPERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A city bus struck and seriously injured an NYPD
traffic agent Tuesday evening, then jumped a curb and crashed into
a Solomon Smith Barney building.
</P>
<P>
   Two other people were seriously hurt, and at least 34 injured in
all. Many were treated at the scene by dozens of medical
technicians, according to a Fire Department spokesman and eye
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The wreck happened on 34th Street between Eighth and Ninth
avenues in Manhattan and temporarily halted traffic on the block.
The eastbound bus was left standing on end in the middle of the
street, its front section in the doorway of the 10-story building
it struck.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Bolcy, 34, works around the corner from the accident and
said he saw the bus driver slumped over the wheel before the bus
came to rest.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw the bus jump up on the sidewalk and through the trees.
He didn't even slow down,'' Bolcy said. ''If he hadn't hit that
wall, he'd still be going.''
</P>
<P>
   The bus hit the traffic agent as the agent leaned into the
window of a parked car, Bolcy said. Another witness reported seeing
the bus driver thrown out a window when he hit the building.
</P>
<P>
   Others ''were jumping out of the windows of the bus and
running,'' Bolcy said.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't immediately clear whether any pedestrians other than
the traffic agent were hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Two of those seriously hurt were taken to St. Vincent's
Hospital. The third went to Bellevue.

<HEADLINE> Lazio makes cameo appearance at GOP convention  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) - New York U.S. Senate candidate Rick Lazio
used his brief appearance Tuesday at the Republican National
Convention to slam first lady Hillary Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know about you, but I don't want to be lectured for
the next six years by Hillary Rodham Clinton,'' Lazio told a
cheering New York GOP delegation.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, running in a state where Democrats hold a 5-to-3 voting
advantage, sought to keep his distance from the more conservative
national GOP platform, including its anti-abortion plank. He
carefully managed all of his public appearance so that beyond doing
media interviews, he appeared only with moderate New York
politicians like Gov. George Pataki and New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   He also publicly rejected the national platform, especially the
recently reaffirmed anti-abortion platform. ''I don't support the
anti-abortion plank,'' Lazio said. ''I think the platform, frankly,
has become largely obsolete.''
</P>
<P>
   He said GOP presidential nominee George W. Bush's more
mainstream ideas were the real party platform. ''Governor Bush is
running on the ideas that he believes in and that's what's
important,'' he said. ''I'm running on the ideas that I believe in.
I'll be running on my record.''
</P>
<P>
   A Zogby International poll Sunday had Lazio holding a slight
lead over Clinton, 50 percent to 42 percent with a 4 percentage
point margin of error. Several of the most recent previous polls
had shown the two in a dead heat.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio stepped into the race for the seat of retiring Democratic
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan when Giuliani dropped out in May after
being diagnosed with prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio reminded supporters that support for him against Clinton
could help Bush against Vice President Al Gore in New York, which
usually votes Democratic in presidential elections. ''We are
effectively running against the White House and all that entails,''
he said. ''The better we do, the worse it is for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki also jumped on Clinton, telling a cheering breakfast
crowd that Clinton didn't know the difference between Erie County,
N.Y., and Erie, Pa. - a reference to her calling a Pennsylvania
radio station last week thinking she was calling one in New York -
and that when Bush wins: ''We will finally have a first lady we can
be proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to spoil Lazio's day, New York Democratic Party
Chairwoman Judith Hope appeared at the New York GOP's hotel to call
on Lazio to release his income tax records. ''We just decided to
follow him here to Philadelphia ... to tell him we're not going
away, we really think he should do the right thing,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Former New York U.S. Sen. Alfonse D'Amato defended Lazio and
pointed out all of the financial controversies the first lady has
been part of. ''The last person in the world to be attacking anyone
is Judith Hope,'' D'Amato said. ''If she wants to talk about
someone's tax record, she should look at their own candidate,
Hillary Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said he would release his tax record by the end of summer.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Lazio supporters said his low profile in Philadelphia
illustrates how different he is from Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rick's focus has to be on New York and not on national
politics,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, New York GOP consultant and television
commentator Jay Severin said Lazio's image could be harmed by
spending a lot of time at a convention that just reaffirmed the
party's anti-abortion and other conservative planks.
</P>
<P>
   ''He doesn't need to give Hillary Clinton big fat targets to
shoot at,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Cook Wins Wells Fargo Invitational  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWCASTLE, Wash. (AP) -- John Cook set the course record with a
10-under-par 62 Tuesday and it gave him a three-stroke victory over
Brent Geiberger in the Wells Fargo Invitational, a charity event
hosted by Seattle native Fred Couples.
</P>
<P>
   Cook, who had a 13-under 131 total, broke the record of 66 set
Monday on the year-old The Golf Club at Newcastle by Geiberger.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Sluman, who had a 68, finished third at 138, while PGA
rookie and Seattle native Jeff Gove had a 72 and was at 141, one
stroke in front of Couples, who had a 69 Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cook started and ended his round with a birdie and he added
eight others.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was telling (Sluman) that I don't care what the event is,''
Cook said. ''I don't care if it's playing with your buddies at
home, or pros on the tour. Making birdie putts is fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Cook, ranked 105th on the PGA Tour money list this year, became
the first two-time winner of the charity event, which began in
1994. He won in 1995 with a final-round 63.

<HEADLINE> Barak: U.S. To Build Embassy  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The United States plans to move its embassy to
Jerusalem by Jan. 20, the day President Clinton leaves office,
Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Barak told Israel television he understood the United States
''will rent offices by Jan. 20, and they will build an embassy.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Barak's statement, State Department spokeswoman
Victoria DeLong and White House spokesman P.J. Crowley both said
they had no information that a final decision had been made on
moving the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The two spokespeople referred back to Clinton's statement Friday
that he intends to review moving the embassy and that he will make
a decision by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Barak mentioned the embassy move as among the positive results
of the failed U.S.-mediated summit at Camp David with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   After the talks collapsed, Clinton expressed concern that the
Palestinians would make good on their pledge to declare statehood
unilaterally on Sept. 13, if there is no agreement by that deadline
for a final peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton suggested that would prompt him to move the embassy from
Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   The move would lend support to Israeli claims to the city -- but
would also infuriate many in the Muslim world. Some militant groups
have threatened to target U.S. diplomats if the United States moved
its embassy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has suggested that the Palestinians were more to blame
for the collapse of the Camp David summit, by not moving as Israel
had on the sensitive issue of Jerusalem. Both sides softened
positions on other core issues, including refugees and borders.
</P>
<P>
   Barak agreed to extend limited sovereignty to the Palestinians
in some of the city's Arab neighborhoods. Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat insisted on full sovereignty throughout east Jerusalem,
including the ultrasensitive walled Old City, home to sites holy to
Muslims, Christians and Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said that the Muslim quarter of the Old City, and Sheik
Jarrah -- an Arab area abutting the walls of the Old City -- were not
on the table ''at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Not counting out discussion of those areas -- once the sacred
core of every Israeli government's commitment to Jerusalem -- showed
how far Barak had moved. Some in the Israeli opposition say he has
gone too far and are calling for early elections.
</P>
<P>
   Barak also said that a multibillion dollar fund set up by the
United States and European nations to compensate Palestinian made
refugees by Israel's 1948 independence war would also compensate
Jews driven out of Arab countries after the war.

<HEADLINE> Pataki gets increased role in convention  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) - Gov. George Pataki, who started the National
Republican Convention hosting intimate breakfast meetings, assumed
a higher profile Tuesday when tapped to replace actor Bruce Willis
for a tribute to the surviving GOP presidents.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, a diehard supporter of Texas Gov. George W. Bush,
provided the narration while video clips of the Ronald Reagan,
Gerald Ford and George Bush presidencies played on large screens
for delegates.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, 87, and Bush, 76, were on hand for the event. Former first
lady Nancy Reagan attended in behalf of her 89-year-old husband,
who has Alzheimer's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki's name came up Monday when schedulers found out that
Willis could not keep his commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bad consolation prize for someone who had been on Bush's
short-list of potential running mates.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was March of '99 when I endorsed Governor Bush and since
that time I've been trying to be supportive,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki will meet Bush when the presumed nominee arrives at the
Philadelphia airport Wednesday, and introduce him at a rally there.
</P>
<P>
   Bush seems willing to have the New York governor closely
involved. Pataki is one of a group of Republican governors here in
Philadelphia entrusted by Bush to rev up the delegates.
</P>
<P>
   ''They pick people they think have the creditability to go out
and talk to delegations about the issues on which Governor Bush is
basing his campaign,'' Pataki spokeswoman Zenia Mucha said.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki led the cheerleading - on a different subject every day
but always along the Republican convention theme - to delegates
from Idaho, Nevada, Delaware, Michigan, North Carolina, Virginia,
Massachusetts and California.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki continued to deflect questions about his willingness to
accept a job in a Bush cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ''I love being governor, I've always loved being governor,'' he
said. ''I'm going to continue to do everything I can to continue to
make New York, our great state, a better state and I'm going to try
from now until November 7 to help Governor Bush in any way I can
but I love being governor.''

<HEADLINE> U of Minn. Coach Admits Payment  </HEADLINE>
By ARNIE STAPLETON
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- The University of Minnesota might have found
a way to retrieve its $1.5 million buyout of former basketball
coach Clem Haskins.
</P>
<P>
   A university attorney said Tuesday that Haskins has acknowledged
giving $3,000 to a woman who tutored basketball players after she
had been ordered to stay away from the program.
</P>
<P>
   Haskins had denied such a payment in his previous responses to
NCAA and school investigators, as well as to university president
Mark Yudof.
</P>
<P>
   But in an ''addition and correction process'' to the NCAA's
official notice of inquiry, Haskins acknowledged the payment to
former tutor Jan Gangelhoff in spring 1998, university attorney
Mark Rotenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This allegation is new information to the university and
constitutes an important, sad turn of events,'' Rotenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Rotenberg said the university has not decided whether it would
try to reclaim the $1.5 million buyout to Haskins, but said lawyers
are looking into it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not going to happen this week,'' Rotenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Rotenberg said the university might consider a claim of
''fraudulent inducement'' if school officials could show they
didn't have information on the payment when they bought out
Haskins' contract in June 1999, three months after the scandal
broke.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Zamansky, Haskins' attorney, would not comment specifically
on the latest revelation or on Rotenberg's suggestion that the
university could try to reclaim Haskins' financial settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no change in Coach Haskins' belief that the
conclusion of the independent investigators is wrong,'' Zamansky
said.
</P>
<P>
   Haskins did not immediately return a call to his Kentucky ranch.
</P>
<P>
   Rotenberg also said it was his understanding that Haskins
maintains that he did not know Gangelhoff was doing coursework for
players.
</P>
<P>
   ''So, this admission doesn't necessarily mean that Coach Haskins
is now acknowledging that he knew about the cheating,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yudof has defended the buyout of Haskins, saying the university
needed to move on and it was a decision based on the best
information he had at the time.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal broke in March 1999 when Gangelhoff told the Saint
Paul Pioneer Press she did more than 400 pieces of coursework for
up to 20 players.
</P>
<P>
   The university launched an investigation that took nine months
and led to a 1,000-page report now in the hands of the NCAA. The
school's report concluded in November that Haskins knew of the
fraud, lied to investigators and told his players to lie after the
wrongdoing was exposed.
</P>
<P>
   A federal grand jury also is looking into the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Haskins originally denied he had paid Gangelhoff to work with
players after she had been disassociated from the program because
of suspicions that she was doing players' coursework. But the
university's investigation concluded that he was the only
''reasonable source'' of the payment.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U. of M. is an academic institution; we're not the FBI,''
Rotenberg said. ''We spent a lot of time and money trying to
isolate the truth. We think we got this allegation essentially
right the first time, but the misstatements by Mr. Haskins
regarding this particular point obviously did not help our
investigators.''
</P>
<P>
   Haskins' personal financial records, turned over to the NCAA,
showed the payment was made, Rotenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   University officials will appear at an NCAA infractions
committee hearing later this month to argue that the basketball
program shouldn't be penalized beyond the self-sanctions already
imposed, including scholarship reductions, recruiting restrictions
and repayment of some tournament money.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA is expected to rule on the matter in October.

   DALLAS (AP) -- The Dallas Mavericks re-signed free agents Hubert
Davis and Gary Trent on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the contracts were not released, but Trent, who opted
out of his contract on July 1, was expected to sign a one-year deal
that will raise his salary from $2.2 million to $2.4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Davis had rejected a one-year offer worth $3.5 million, even
though the six-year value of his previous contract was just $4.5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, an eight-year pro from North Carolina, played in 79 games
for the Mavericks last season and averaged 7.4 points, 1.7 rebounds
and 1.8 assists per game. He led the NBA in three-point shooting at
49.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Trent, a forward, was limited to 11 games due to groin and
hamstring injuries. He averaged 13.7 points and 4.7 rebounds in
27.4 minutes per game.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Airport Probe Begins  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- In the wake of a power failure that
shut down Sydney Airport for 80 minutes, federal authorities began
a probe Wednesday amid concerns about the airport's ability to cope
with Olympic traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The shutdown Tuesday morning at the airport control tower was
the second in less than a month. All international and domestic
takeoffs were grounded, and some arriving planes were diverted to
other airports.
</P>
<P>
   More than 500 flights were delayed, diverted or canceled
throughout the day, leaving thousands of customers stranded for up
to several hours.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yet again Sydney Airport collapses in a heap. I shudder to
think what's going to happen when the Olympics are on,'' said
Sydney businessman Neil Forbes, whose morning flight to Melbourne
was delayed for two hours.
</P>
<P>
   John Anderson, the federal Transport Minister, ordered a review
of airport power supply problems to be conducted by an independent
electrical engineering group. The report is due by next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson also said an internal investigation is being conducted
into claims that maintenance cuts at the airport are affecting
vital equipment. That probe stems from a radar blackout on July 6.
</P>
<P>
   Batteries took over Tuesday when the electricity failed, but two
backup generators that could have provided more power than the
batteries were out of service.
</P>
<P>
   Air traffic controllers were forced to turn off their computers,
air conditioners and even kettles while on battery power, to
prevent a total airport blackout.
</P>
<P>
   The airport will be operating at full capacity during the
Olympic period, especially right before and after the Games, which
are scheduled for Sept. 15-Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they can't get it right now, how will they cope in the
Olympics?'' asked Richard Mortimer, who was delayed 90 minutes on
his flight from Adelaide to Sydney. ''Perhaps they'd better start
checking all the plugs.''

<HEADLINE> Pirates Sign Benjamin To Extension  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Pirates signed reserve
infielder Mike Benjamin to a $1.85 million, two-year contract
extension Tuesday, one day after utilityman John Vander Wal agreed
to a two-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin has played second base, shortstop and third base since
signing with the Pirates as a free agent before the 1999 season,
batting .247 in 110 games last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without question, he's been a real good player for us,''
general manager Cam Bonifay said. ''He's probably as good as there
is at what he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin, 34, is hitting .277 with two homers and 15 RBIs this
season. He has made only 10 errors in his two Pirates seasons. He
is a .234 career hitter in 12 seasons with the Giants, Phillies,
Red Sox and Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin, who has a $700,000 salary this season, will make
$925,000 per year in 2000 and 2001. He could make an additional
$300,000 per year in incentives based on plate appearances.

<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Vladimir Guerrero hit a three-run homer and Trey
Moore pitched five shutout innings in his first appearance in more
than two years as the Montreal Expos snapped a seven-game skid with
a 4-0 win Tuesday night over the St. Louis Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrero hit his 26th home run -- and first since July 16 -- off
Rick Ankiel (7-7) with runners on first and second in the fifth
inning as Montreal won for just the sixth time in its last 21
games.
</P>
<P>
   Moore (1-0), making his first appearance since June 6, 1998,
allowed two hits and three walks, and struck out eight. He missed
the entire 1999 season after having arthroscopic surgery on his
left shoulder Aug. 5, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Telford allowed two hits over two innings in relief of
Moore and Steve Kline finished the Expos' fourth shutout of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, whose season-high 10-game lead in the NL Central
over Cincinnati was down to four before the game, is 7-13 since
Mark McGwire went on the DL.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal's Milton Bradley singled with one out in the fifth and
advanced to second on Jose Vidro's infield single.
</P>
<P>
   After a groundout, Guerrero hit a drive over the wall in left
center to put the Expos up 3-0. Guerrero, who was intentionally
walked twice in the game, leads the Expos with 86 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Ankiel, 1-4 in his last five starts, allowed six hits and three
runs in five innings. He struck out five and walked three.
</P>
<P>
   Moore didn't allow his first hit until Craig Paquette singled
with one out in the fifth. Fernando Vina added a two-out single
before Moore struck out Edgar Renteria with his 82nd pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Will Clark, acquired from Baltimore on Monday to play first base
while McGwire is out with a knee injury, doubled off the base of
the wall in right center with two outs in the seventh in his first
at-bat for St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Andy Tracy's RBI triple in the seventh off reliever
Matt Morris drove in Montreal's fourth run.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Clark arrived at Olympic Stadium a few hours before the
game and took batting practice. Clark, who wears number 28, entered
the game at first base in the sixth. ... Carlos Hernandez made his
first start behind the plate for the Cardinals, batting seventh. He
went 1-for-4. ... Eric Davis left the team Monday and flew to Los
Angeles because of a death in his family. He is expected to rejoin
the team in St. Louis this weekend. ... Montreal's Mike Mordecai
went home to Warrior, Ala., Tuesday, where his wife Jennifer was
due to give birth to their first child. Mordecai is expected to
rejoin the team on Friday in Houston. ... Moore became the 12th
starter the Expos have used this season. He also became the team's
25th pitcher this season, a new team record.

	   NIAGARA FALLS, N.Y. (AP) - Ceramic fibers maker Unifrax Corp. on
Monday moved to double its size with the acquisition of Carborundum
Insulation Technologies.
</P>
<P>
   Unifrax officials said the deal potentially pushes Unifrax's
sales above $160 million while making the company a major
international player in the high-temperature insulating products
market.
</P>
<P>
   ''We, for the most part, have been a North American-focused
business,'' said Paul J. Viola, Unifrax's vice president of
acquisitions and strategic development. ''That kept us out of about
two-thirds of the worldwide ceramic fiber market.''
</P>
<P>
   Viola said the acquisition is not expected to have any direct
impact on the company's Western New York operations, which include
plants in Tonawanda, Amherst, and Sanborn, as well as its
headquarters and research laboratory in Niagara Falls.
</P>
<P>
   The deal reunites Unifrax - the U.S. ceramics fiber business
that St. Gobain SA did not acquire when it purchased most of
Carborundum's operations in 1995 - with what had been its foreign
sister business, at once providing the company visibility to the
worldwide ceramic fiber market, Viola said.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition is expected to help Unifrax sell its new Isofrax
thermal insulation, which the company is marketing as a new type of
insulation that meets European health and safety regulations.
Isofrax, which is made of bio-soluble fiber, can be used to
insulate turbines, furnaces, kilns and flues, as well as other high
temperature uses.
</P>
<P>
   The terms of the deal were not disclosed. Unifrax said it will
finance the acquisition with a combination of bank debt and seller
financing. The purchase is expected to close by the end of
September.

<HEADLINE> Diamond Trade Targeted in Africa  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Accused of fueling Sierra Leone's civil
war, Liberia and Burkina Faso promised Tuesday to cooperate with
investigations and asked for aid to end the illegal trade in
diamonds and arms in their countries.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Britain charged Monday that the presidents
of the two West African countries were helping Sierra Leone's
notorious rebels sell diamonds and buy increasingly sophisticated
weapons that have kept the nine-year war going.
</P>
<P>
   The two-day open hearing on the role of ''blood diamonds'' in
the war, organized by the U.N. Security Council committee
monitoring sanctions against Sierra Leone, put the spotlight on
Liberia and Burkina Faso as conduits for the illegal trade in
diamonds and weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Bangladesh's U.N. Ambassador Anwarul Chowdhury, who chairs the
committee, said it will examine the allegations against the two
countries. ''Before the Security Council takes a decision, it has
to look into these more closely and more thoroughly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In early July, the Security Council imposed a ban on the
purchase of Sierra Leone diamonds that don't have a government
certificate. The move was aimed at strangling the ability of the
rebel Revolutionary United Front to finance the civil war, which
has killed and maimed tens of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke warned Monday that Washington
would support measures against Burkina Faso and Liberia unless they
stop facilitating rebel diamond sales. U.S. officials said the
measures could include freezing the countries' foreign assets and
visa restrictions on senior officials.
</P>
<P>
   Liberian Foreign Minister Monie Captan and Burkina Faso's U.N.
Ambassador Michel Kafando demanded proof of the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's concluding session, Captan noted that Sierra Leone
recently reported an increase in its diamond revenue and asked
whether the government there might be selling rebel diamonds since
the RUF still controls about 90 percent of the diamond mines.
</P>
<P>
   He said Liberia will ''actively participate'' in a regional
investigation of the illegal diamond trade, which includes RUF
representatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''Liberia remains committed to working with the international
community in finding ways and means of bringing to an end the
illegal trade in arms and diamonds,'' Captan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberian minister urged the international community and U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan to provide technical assistance to
help Liberia ''monitor and control illicit trading within its
territory.'' Liberia also wants U.N. peacekeeping troops deployed
on its side of the Sierra Leone border to improve monitoring, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Kafando said Burkina Faso is ''ready and willing'' to receive
investigators from the United Nations or any other source.
</P>
<P>
   Burkina Faso also needs international expertise to address the
problem of diamond trafficking and has asked for radar to better
monitor its airports, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But closing the diamond traffic through other nations is just
part of the overall solution to severing the link between diamonds
and war, representatives from governments, the diamond industry and
private organizations told Tuesday's session.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs
Howard Jeter said Sierra Leone must also deal with official
corruption, and the international diamond markets must address
''the larger issue of the lack of transparency and
accountability.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain's U.N. Ambassador Jeremy Greenstock questioned whether a
system to certify Sierra Leone diamonds could work without a global
system to certify the origin of every diamond in the world -- a
system that until now does not exist.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jeter said closing the illegal routes was a priority.
</P>
<P>
   ''Rough diamonds from Sierra Leone will continue to seek the
most profitable route to market,'' he said. ''Illicit routes -- and
in particular those that facilitate the diamonds-for-arms trade --
must be shut down.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan announced appointments Tuesday to a five-member panel to
collect information on possible violations of the arms embargo and
the link between the diamond trade and arms. It will be chaired by
Martin Chungong Ayafor of Cameroon.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the situation in Sierra Leone ''dangerous and
volatile,'' the secretary-general said achieving a durable peace in
Sierra Leone will require a politicial solution ''based on a robust
and credible international military presence.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States opposes any increase in the U.N. peacekeeping
force in Sierra Leone, which is nearing its 13,000-strong ceiling.
But Annan said in a report to the Security Council Tuesday that he
remains convinced the force should be beefed up and would make a
recommendation shortly.

<HEADLINE> Japan Test Flight Arrives in Cuba  </HEADLINE>
By VIVIAN SEQUERA
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA (AP) -- Dozens of travel agents, journalists and tourists
arrived in Cuba Tuesday evening on the first of four Japanese
flights aimed at discovering whether this Caribbean island could
become a major tourism destination for Asian travelers.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the flights will help expose the Cuban people
to people and customs from another part of the world, said Kenya
Uno, chief political and economic officer for the Japanese Embassy
in Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the four charter flights of Boeing 747 jets owned by
Japan Airlines will carry up to 350 passengers. The first flight
carried 286 travelers.
</P>
<P>
   The visits are the result of an agreement between the airline
and the state-operated Cuban tourism company Cubanacan. For the
visits to continue after the initial flights, there will have to be
enough Japanese interested to make the trips worth the cost, Uno
said.
</P>
<P>
   The four trial trips call for five days on the island, with
visits to the beach resort of Varadero and the colonial city of
Trinidad, as well as the capital Havana.
</P>
<P>
   Traveling on the first flight were members of the board of
directors of Japan Airlines, as well as Masatake Kusamichi, member
of the board of directors of the Nissho-Iwai corporation, which is
among the 10 largest commercial firms in Japan. Nissho-Iwai is also
the principal commercial creditor of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   About 4,000 Japanese visited Cuba last year, and that number
could surpass 5,000 this year, according to Japanese Embassy
estimates. Japanese officials add that much will depend on the kind
of attention received by the Japanese visitors, who are accustomed
to first-class service.
</P>
<P>
   So far the service in Cuba, Uno said, ''does not reach that
level.''
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for the first wave of Japanese visitors, the chef
from the Japanese ambassador's residence in Havana gave a three-day
course in sushi preparation to the chefs at one of the capital's
best hotels, the Melia Cohiba.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Cubans chefs' first efforts at sushi, said Uno, ''We
tasted it ... and frankly, it turned out very well.''

<HEADLINE> Witness: Teitelbaum, Doherty have hotel confrontation  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) - While the talk is of compassion and unity at
the Republican National Convention, things aren't running quite so
smoothly among New York's attendees.
</P>
<P>
   According to two witnesses, tempers flared in the New York GOP's
convention hotel lobby Monday night as one of Gov. George Pataki's
top aides had a verbal confrontation with the manager of New York
City Mayor Rudy Giuliani's aborted U.S. Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation between Bruce Teitelbaum, the Giuliani
official, and Thomas Doherty, Pataki's chief patronage dispenser,
occurred in the lobby of the Warwick Hotel shortly before midnight,
according to Leonard Guttman, a vice president with the New York
City Health and Hospitals Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum refused to comment Tuesday on the incident. A
spokeswoman for Pataki denied there had been any confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   Guttman said he was talking with Teitelbaum in the Warwick
lobby.
</P>
<P>
   ''Governor Pataki had walked in and was going up the elevator
and then a moment later this guy comes up and starts shouting at
Bruce, shouting in a very agitated way - verbally abusive,'' the
Giuliani administration aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Guttman said he was told after the incident by Teitelbaum and
another person that the man doing the shouting was Doherty.
</P>
<P>
   ''I never met him in my life,'' Guttman said.
</P>
<P>
   Guttman said the encounter lasted ''a few minutes, or at least
it felt that way.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ''Bruce held his cool ... . At the end, they just
walked away'' from each other, Guttman said.
</P>
<P>
   Another source familiar with the incident and speaking only on
condition of anonymity said Doherty accused the ''Giuliani camp''
of being responsible for a story in Monday's New York Post saying
Pataki was working behind the scenes to replace state GOP Chairman
William Powers with Doherty.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, Powers and other Republicans have denied the story.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki spokeswoman Zenia Mucha denied there had been any
confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is such an out-and-out lie,'' Mucha said. ''He and Tom
had a 15-second conversation and Tom kept going.''
</P>
<P>
   She refused to make Doherty available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the state settled a lawsuit against Doherty and
others for more than $150,000 stemming from an argument he got into
in 1996 with a state worker in an Albany bar.
</P>
<P>
   The employee, who was subsequently fired, said Doherty had vowed
during their argument that she would lose her job. The employee, as
part of the settlement, was given a new state job.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the Pataki and Giuliani camps have been
strained ever since 1994, when the Republican mayor crossed party
lines to endorse then-Gov. Mario Cuomo in his bid for a fourth
term.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki beat Cuomo, a Democrat, in that race to become governor.

<HEADLINE> Israel Inagurates New President  </HEADLINE>
By RON KAMPEAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's new president was inaugurated Tuesday
and pledged to maintain peace at home while Israel's government
pursues peace with its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe you chose me to bring peace among us,'' Moshe Katsav
told legislators, adding that making peace with the Arabs was best
left to parliament and the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   That was a veiled reference to former Prime Minister and Nobel
peace laureate Shimon Peres, whom Katsav defeated Monday in a poll
of the Knesset's 120 legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Peres was the nominee of Prime Minister Ehud Barak's government,
and was expected to promote Barak's far-reaching proposals to
finalize peace with the Palestinians and the Syrians. Katsav's
Likud party said that was inappropriate for the largely ceremonial
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   The peace process has riven Israelis, and Katsav has said he
would put aside his own hard-line beliefs and work to mend the
wounds.
</P>
<P>
   He mentioned the 1995 assassination of peace architect Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin by an ultranationalist Jew, and he suggested
that his countrymen -- still mired in shrill debate -- had learned
nothing from that tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Have we learned the lesson of this abominable murder?'' he
asked.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for Katsav's victory was his appeal -- as an observant
Jew -- to the Knesset's 22 ultra-Orthodox lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   He wore a skullcap during the swearing-in, even though it is not
a religious ceremony, and told legislators that he believed the
Jews had survived centuries in exile ''only because our ancestors
kept the commandments.''
</P>
<P>
   He said one of his goals would be to reinforce Israel's ties to
Diaspora Jews.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must act to increase their attachment to Israel and
Judaism, each year thousands abandon Judaism and become alienated
from it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Katsav, 54, was born in Iran, and is the first president to come
from among the Jews who immigrated from Muslim countries and who
suffered discrimination at the hands of the European Jewish
establishment in the first years of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Ezer Weizman, who was president until last month, congratulated
Katsav and said his election was a sign that Israel had overcome
such social distinctions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once Israel was divided into 'ours' and 'others','' said
Weizman, himself a scion of the establishment. ''No longer: the
definition of 'others' is not worthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Weizman's term was cut short by three years after he admitted to
taking hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash gifts from a
millionaire French friend. A police report recommended against
prosecution, but suggested he should step down.
</P>
<P>
   ''Try not to get into trouble,'' Weizman cracked to Katsav.
''It's not easy''

<HEADLINE> Councilman charged with drunken driving  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DUMONT, N.J. (AP) - A Dumont councilman was charged with drunken
driving on Tuesday after Bergen County prosecutors began an
investigation into whether the borough's mayor and police chief
tried to squash his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Fredericks, who serves as the council's liaison to the
police department, was charged with driving while intoxicated,
careless driving, failure to keep right and failure to wear a seat
belt for allegedly driving drunk on July 22.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors directed police to issue the charges as a result of
the investigation into the incident, Assistant Bergen County
Prosecutor Lucia Van Wetering said.
</P>
<P>
   The office has questioned Mayor Donald Winant and Police Chief
Michael Affrunti after learning that Fredericks was taken into
custody, then released.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement sources have told The Record of Hackensack that
Affrunti ordered police to release Fredericks while officers were
processing charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   Fredericks didn't return a message left at his office Tuesday.
His home telephone rang unanswered. Winant and Affrunti also didn't
return telephone messages Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Sources who spoke on condition of anonymity told The Record that
officers found Fredericks sleeping at the wheel of his sports
utility vehicle outside a Knights of Columbus lodge, drove him
home, then later spotted him weaving along the road in his car.
Fredericks failed a roadside sobriety test, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   After Fredericks was arrested, Affrunti came from home into the
station and ordered police to release him, the sources said. Winant
arrived to drive Fredericks home, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Affrunti told a reporter last week that Fredericks was never
pulled over, The Record said.
</P>
<P>
   Fredericks faces a Sept. 13 appearance in municipal court on the
charges. Penalties for the most serious offense, driving while
intoxicated, range from 30 days to six months in jail and the loss
of a driver's license for six months to 10 years.

<HEADLINE> Mets 3, Reds 2  </HEADLINE>
By IRA PODELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Mike Hampton pitched 7 1-3 strong innings and
drove in a run and new shortstop Mike Bordick had three hits and an
RBI Tuesday night in the New York Mets' 3-2 victory over the
Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton (11-7) allowed two runs and eight hits to snap the Reds'
four-game winning streak. The left-hander struck out six and did
not walk a batter.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds chased Hampton in the eighth after he allowed a leadoff
single to Chris Stynes and an RBI double to Barry Larkin. One out
later, Turk Wendell relieved and gave up a triple to Dante Bichette
that scored Larkin.
</P>
<P>
   John Franco came on and walked Alex Ochoa, got Sean Casey to
ground out and struck out Benito Santiago looking with runners on
second and third.
</P>
<P>
   Armando Benitez pitched the ninth for his 26th save in 30
chances.
</P>
<P>
   Bordick went 3-for-4 in his fourth game since being acquired
from Baltimore. Edgardo Alfonzo and Bubba Trammell added two hits
apiece for the Mets, who won for the seventh time in eight games.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Parris (5-14) pitched well for the Reds after allowing
single runs in the first two innings. He allowed three runs and
seven hits in six innings and has lost 10 of 13 decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets took a 1-0 lead in the first when Alfonzo singled with
two outs, moved to second on a walk to Mike Piazza and scored on
Robin Ventura's single. Hampton gave New York a two-run lead an
inning later with a sacrifice fly to right, following singles by
Trammell and Bordick.
</P>
<P>
   Bordick made it 3-0 in the sixth with an RBI single after Parris
walked Todd Zeile and Trammell with two outs.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Reds longest winning streak of the season is six from
May 7-13. ... Hampton, who walked nine on opening day in Tokyo, has
walked one batter in his last two starts. ... Bordick was 1-for-10
after his homer on the first pitch he saw with the Mets on
Saturday. ... For the second straight night Larkin was booed by
Mets fans, disappointed he vetoed a trade last month that would
have brought him to New York. Larkin reached on Bordick's error in
the first inning. Bordick, New York's second choice to replace the
injured Rey Ordonez at shortstop, reached in the fourth when Larkin
booted his grounder. Bordick was credited with a hit. ... Reds
pitching coach Don Gullett was doing better after experiencing
tightness in his chest following Monday's game. Gullett is expected
to rejoin the club either Tuesday or Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Oil Giant Fined $94M  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- The government has fined federal
oil giant Petrobras $94 million for causing the country's worst oil
spill in 25 years, a news agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The federal Environmental Protection Agency ordered Petrobras to
pay the amount over three years for a spill earlier this month that
damaged some 370 acres of a preserved area along the Iguacu River,
in southern Brazil, and killed some of the river's fauna, Estado
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   It took workers several days to contain the more than 1 million
gallons of crude oil that spewed from a burst Petrobras pipeline at
the Getulio Vargas refinery in Araucaria, about 435 miles southwest
of Rio.
</P>
<P>
   The government fined Petrobras $28 million in January, when an
underwater oil pipe broke and spewed at least 340,000 gallons of
crude into Rio's famous Guanabara Bay and through protected
mangrove swamps.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's worst oil disaster was in 1975, when an oil tanker from
Iraq dumped nearly 8 million gallons of crude into the bay and
forced the closure of Rio's famous beaches for nearly three weeks.

<HEADLINE> First witness faints in front of jury after describing Bosnian atrocities </HEADLINE>
By LARRY NEUMEISTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A woman haunted by memories of repeated rape by
Bosnian Serb soldiers fainted Tuesday in front of a jury deciding
if a former wartime leader should pay damages for atrocities
committed by his soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse brought a dramatic close to the first day of a
trial to determine how much money, if any, Radovan Karadzic should
be ordered to pay. The Bosnian Serb leader is already under
indictment by the U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague,
Netherlands, on charges of genocide. He is an international
fugitive and was not in court Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The witness who fainted was identified only as ''N.S.'' and is
among 10 victims accusing Karadzic of crimes against humanity. The
group is suing him in U.S. District Court in Manhattan under a
221-year-old law that allows foreign citizens to sue foreign
officials and citizens for violating the law of nations.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey Clark, a lawyer who has represented Karadzic in the past,
did not immediately return a telephone message.
</P>
<P>
   Catharine A. MacKinnon, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said the
case resulted because women were ''raped in captivity with
factory-like efficiency.''
</P>
<P>
   Another lawyer, Maria T. Vullo, called the plaintiffs ''refugees
who are asking you to tell them and the world that what happened to
them is wrong and should never happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Money could never remedy damage like this but this suit is all
they have,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs allege Karadzic personally planned and ordered a
campaign of murder, rape, forced impregnation and other torture.
</P>
<P>
   N.S. said she was living with her husband and two children in
Bosnia in the early summer of 1992 when soldiers gathered outside
her home, including a neighbor who had propositioned her weeks
earlier and threatened her when she declined.
</P>
<P>
   She said they took her and the children in a car to a barn where
she was raped by the neighbor, who told her she would be forced to
deliver a Serbian child and that she was now under the control of
an invincible Serbian army.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks afterward, she said, she was repeatedly raped by
Serbian soldiers who wore pictures of Karadzic on their pockets.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was very humiliated that this was happening to me,'' she
recalled tearfully as she spoke through an interpreter. ''I was
thinking of killing my children and then committing suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she feared the soldiers would attack her 8-year-old
daughter because they threatened to treat the girl as they had her
mother.
</P>
<P>
   ''I begged them to do to me whatever they please but to spare my
children,'' she said. ''One of the soldiers took her hand and I
fainted and collapsed.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she later awoke with her children at her side, happy
she was alive.
</P>
<P>
   '''They're gone mommy. They didn't touch me,''' she said her
daughter told her.
</P>
<P>
   Months after their ordeal began, the three were rescued by a man
who drove them to the International Red Cross but warned: ''Don't
you ever tell anyone who saved you, who brought you here.''
</P>
<P>
   N.S. was the first witness in the trial being heard by a
six-person jury.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Peter K. Leisure said Karadzic had already
been found in default, so the jury must only determine the value of
damages.
</P>
<P>
   N.S. said she was testifying in the hopes that others would
learn that what happened in Bosnia should never happen anywhere,
regardless of nation or race. She now lives in Croatia with her
family, and said she occasionally suffers fainting spells because
of the trauma.
</P>
<P>
   After she fainted in court, pictures of Karadzic were taken down
and ambulance workers who treated her were asked to remove their
uniforms because of the memories they might revive.
</P>
<P>
   A lawyer for the plaintiffs had taped a photograph of Karadzic
to the chair where the defendant would ordinarily sit. A larger
picture of him also was placed on an easel before the jury.
</P>
<P>
   ''He couldn't destroy me,'' N.S. said she would like to tell
Karadzic. ''We are alive. He couldn't destroy us just because we
are Muslims.''

<HEADLINE> DEC says zebra mussels are declining  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WATERTOWN, N.Y. (AP) - They still number in the billions, but
zebra mussel populations around New York are declining, state
environmental officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Although New York State Department of Environmental officials
stopped counting the quarter-inch, black-and-white-striped zebra
mussels in 1995 because there simply were too many, Steve R. LaPan,
Lake Ontario unit leader for the DEC, said their numbers have
stopped increasing.
</P>
<P>
   The reason? Not enough to eat.
</P>
<P>
   And, according to information obtained from recent dives in the
lake, the mussels also are up to 11 millimeters smaller.
</P>
<P>
   Power and water plants have spent $100 million a year to install
filtration and chemical systems to eliminate zebra mussel problems
in their water systems. Still, the pesky creatures have
irreversibly altered the aquatic ecosystem, concentrating toxins in
algae and eliminating native clams.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our system will never go back to what it was,'' said Edward L.
Mills, director of a Cornell University field station on Oneida
Lake. ''Native species are being lost and contaminants are
concentrated. We have 20 percent of the world's fresh water in this
area. We need to do everything we can to protect those systems
because they ultimately affect our health and well-being.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientists say that the scarcity of food is causing quagga
mussels to replace zebra mussels. Quagga mussels are similar in
size but are round on the bottom, instead of flat, and feed on a
greater variety of zooplankton, which makes lake waters clearer.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are vaccum cleaners taking food to a lower level,'' Mills
said.
</P>
<P>
   In Oneida Lake, bass populations are increasing because the
clearer water encourages aquatic plant growth, Mills said.
</P>
<P>
   However, clearer water doesn't mean cleaner water. Airborne and
groundwater toxins, including PCB and mercury, are becoming
concentrated at the bottoms of lakes in the remaining algae plants.
It's possible that an increase in contamination in algae plants
eventually will lead to an increase in contamination in the fish
that feed on those plants.
</P>
<P>
   Clearer water also may contribute to increased mortality in fish
larvae because they are more vulnerable to being found and eaten by
other fish. A decrease in large clams also is evident in Lake
Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some clam beds are full of empty shells,'' LaPan said.
''(Zebra mussels attach to clams and) literally steal food out of
their mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   Impact of the loss of clams has not been determined, but LaPan
said he doesn't believe it will have a direct impact on the fish
system. However, parasites and grubs that clams harbor, and
muskrats that feed on clams may be affected, he said.
</P>
<P>
   With the introduction of such exotics as the zebra mussel, the
Great Lakes are becoming more like the Black, Caspian and Baltic
seas of Europe. Changing ballast in the Atlantic Ocean before
entering the Great Lakes system has improved since the policy
became mandatory, said Charles R. O'Neil, senior extension
associate with Sea Grant. But the system is not foolproof. Some
exotics still remain in the sludge at the bottoms of boats.

<HEADLINE> Teddy Roosevelt's great-grandson speaks to GOP convention  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) - President Theodore Roosevelt was a national
icon, and as a former New York governor, a source of pride for the
entire state.
</P>
<P>
   His great-grandson, Theodore Roosevelt IV, entered the national
political arena Tuesday night by giving a prime-time speech about
protecting the environment, a cause closely linked to President
Roosevelt.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is encouraging that the Republican Party is granting
prime-time attention to issues concerning environmental protection
and conservation of our natural resources,'' said Roosevelt, an
investment banker and chairman of the League of Conservation
Voters. ''Few issues so closely affect our quality of life.''
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt's 2-minute speech focused on environmental concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of the world's best scientists give us 20, maybe 30,
years to turn back the tide on ecological devastation,'' Roosevelt
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But, I daresay, most conservation advocates are not driven
simply by a desire to see our species survive a few more years. No.
Humankind as the great exterminator is simply not a role with which
we can live.''
</P>
<P>
   Roosevelt also is a New York delegate to the convention.
</P>
<P>
   President Roosevelt led America into foreign affairs with a
motto of ''speak softly and carry a big stick,'' and domestically
became a ''trust buster,'' breaking up railroad and other
monopolies. He won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1906 for mediating a
peace to the Russo-Japanese War. He is also known in New York state
as a conservationist after adding greatly to national park land and
western forests and preserving New York's wilderness in the 6
million acre Adirondack Park.
</P>
<P>
   The Roosevelts aren't the only New Yorkers with a family
connection at the convention.
</P>
<P>
   One of the featured speakers Thursday night is U.S. Rep. Vito
Fossella, who will talk about Social Security. His
great-grandfather, former U.S. Rep. James O'Leary, cast a vote in
the House of Representatives to help create Social Security.

<HEADLINE> Bus crash on West 34th Street leaves 34 injured  </HEADLINE>
By LUKAS I. ALPERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A city bus careened onto the sidewalk and into a
building Tuesday evening injuring 34 people, one critically,
including a NYPD traffic agent.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses described seeing the eastbound M-34 bus lose control
shortly after crossing Ninth Avenue on 34th Street. The bus
careened into a parked car, hitting the traffic agent who witnesses
said was leaning into the window of the car talking with the
driver.
</P>
<P>
   The bus then jumped the curb, crashed through a fifteen-foot
tree and then a planter, smashing into the entrance of a Solomon
Smith Barney building, and finally coming to rest in front of a
garage.
</P>
<P>
   The traffic agent fell away from the bus and was not run over,
said Richard Sheirer, director of the city's Office of Emergency
Management.
</P>
<P>
   The traffic agent was brought to Bellevue Hospital and was
listed in serious but stable condition, authorities said. The bus
driver was brought to St. Vincent's, where he was listed in
critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-six others were taken to area hospitals, none with
life-threatening injuries. Six people refused medical treatment,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Other than the driver and traffic agent - who was on the street
- the other 32 injured were all passenger on the bus, authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I saw the bus jump up on the sidewalk and through the trees.
He didn't even slow down,'' said Jean Bolcy, 34, who works around
the corner from where the accident happened.
</P>
<P>
   ''If he hadn't hit that wall, he'd still be going,'' Bolcy
added, saying he thought he saw the bus driver slumped over the
wheel before the bus came to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, passengers ''were jumping out of the windows of the
bus and running,'' Bolcy said.
</P>
<P>
   The wreck happened just after 7 p.m. and halted traffic on the
block for over two hours while dozens of Emergency Medical Service
workers tended to the injured in the shadow of the bus' crumpled
remains.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there's one thing you can say about this it's that this may
be a true miracle on 34th street, that you could have a city bus go
up on the sidewalk at 7 o'clock on a warm summer night and have
only one person get hit,'' Sheirer said.

<HEADLINE> 4th OSU Player Arrested in Beating  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CORVALLIS, Ore. (AP) -- A fourth Oregon State football player was
arrested Tuesday in the beating of another student.
</P>
<P>
   Corvallis police said Dennis Weathersby, 20, turned himself in
to police Tuesday and is charged with third-degree assault.
</P>
<P>
   Weathersby was a freshman cornerback for the Beavers last
season. He broke up 17 passes -- two shy of the school record.
</P>
<P>
   Three Oregon State receivers -- Robert Prescott, Alton ''Junior''
Adams and James Newson -- were charged with third-degree assault in
the case last month.
</P>
<P>
   Third-degree assault is a Class C felony that carries a maximum
prison term of five years.
</P>
<P>
   The players are accused of beating Victor Becerra, 21, at a
Corvallis house party on July 22. He was treated at a hospital for
injuries to the face.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Dennis Erickson announced last week that Prescott and
Adams have been suspended indefinitely from competition. He did not
suspend Newson.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon State athletic officials did not return calls Tuesday
night about Weathersby's status with the team.

<HEADLINE> Ohio St. To Retire Player's Numbers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Heisman Trophy winners Howard ''Hopalong''
Cassady and Vic Janowicz will become the second and third Ohio
State football players to have their numbers officially retired.
</P>
<P>
   The school said Tuesday that Janowicz's No. 31 will be retired
during halftime of a game against Penn State on Sept. 23.
</P>
<P>
   On Nov. 18, Cassady's No. 40 will be retired during halftime
ceremonies of Ohio State's regular season finale against Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   The only Ohio State football player to have his number retired
is Archie Griffin, the 1974 and 1975 Heisman Trophy winner. The
only two-time winner of the Heisman, Griffin wore No. 45.
</P>
<P>
   Janowicz won the Heisman Trophy in 1950. In that season, he
scored 16 touchdowns and accounted for 875 yards in total offense.
In an 83-21 victory over Iowa, he scored two touchdowns, passed for
four and set a Big Ten record with 10 extra points.
</P>
<P>
   Janowicz, a member of the Ohio State Athletic Hall of Fame and
the National Football Foundation Hall of Fame, died in February
1996.
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, Cassady rushed for 701 yards and eight touchdowns and
averaged 5.7 yards per carry, earning him unanimous All-America
honors.
</P>
<P>
   The following year, Cassady again was an All-America after
rushing for 964 yards and 15 touchdowns and won the Heisman Trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Cassady currently lives in Tampa, Fla., but returns to Columbus
in the summer to serve as a coach for the Columbus Clippers, the
top farm team of the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State has had two other Heisman Trophy winners: Les Horvath
in 1944 and Eddie George in 1995.

Houston Comets to a 68-60 victory over Washington on Tuesday night,
dropping the Mystics one game behind Detroit for the final playoff
spot in the Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Washington closed the first half with a 14-3 run to take a 35-33

<HEADLINE> Devil Rays 6, Indians 5  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) -- Gerald Williams hit a two-run single
in the ninth inning to spoil Bob Wickman's Cleveland debut and give
the Tampa Bay Devil Rays their club-record tying sixth straight
win, 6-5 over the Indians on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Wickman came to the Indians last week in a seven-player deal
from Milwaukee. But he couldn't hold a 5-4 lead in his first shot
as closer.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Cox led off the ninth with a walk off Wickman (0-1) and
pinch-runner Jason Tyner went to second on a sacrifice bunt. After
Russ Johnson walked, pinch-hitter Jose Guillen hit an infield
single to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, once traded with Wickman from the Yankees to Milwaukee
in 1996, then lined a soft single to left to win it.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Creek (1-1) pitched a perfect ninth for the win.
</P>
<P>
   The Devil Rays trailed 5-1 before scoring two runs in the sixth.
Miguel Cairo had an RBI double and another run scored when Fred
McGriff grounded into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Cox snapped an 0-for-13 slump with a seventh-inning homer that
made it 5-4.
</P>
<P>
   David Segui hit his second homer since coming to Cleveland last
week from Texas in the second inning to give the Indians a 1-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Wil Cordero, also acquired in a trade last week, added an RBI
double in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thome's two-run homer in the fifth made it 5-1 Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
Notes: McGriff played in his 2,000th career game. .... Both teams
held close door meetings before the game after being active in
recent trades. ... Indians manager Charlie Manuel said Manny
Ramirez, who has been used as a DH since returning from a left
hamstring injury July 13, could resume playing in the outfield by
the end of the week. ... RHP Jaret Wright (shoulder) is scheduled
to throw four innings in his second rehab start Wednesday with
Double-A Akron. ... The Devil Rays placed 3B Vinny Castilla (lower
back inflammation) on the 15-day DL. He could be sidelined an
extended period.

<HEADLINE> Yankees 5, Royals 4  </HEADLINE>
By BEN WALKER
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Scott Brosius, back in the lineup after missing
two games because of tightness in his right calf, homered to lead
off the eighth inning and the New York Yankees beat the Kansas City
Royals 5-4 Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius hit the second pitch from reliever Ricky Bottalico (7-3)
far over the left-field wall for his 10th homer.
</P>
<P>
   Brosius had struck out with the bases loaded in his previous
at-bat. Earlier, he flied out to leave runners at second and third.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals, playing without injured All-Star first baseman Mike
Sweeney, lost their fifth in a row. They fell a season-worst 11
games below .500.
</P>
<P>
   New York stole six bases -- and was caught once -- for its most
steals since April 11, 1998, against Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams hit a two-run double and David Justice followed
with an RBI double as the Yankees rallied for a 4-2 lead in the
seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Damon tied it with a two-run double in the Royals eighth
off Mike Stanton. Jeff Nelson (7-2) struck out Joe Randa with the
bases loaded to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Rivera worked the ninth for his 25th save.
</P>
<P>
   Yankees starter Dwight Gooden pitched seven sharp innings,
giving up one earned run and four hits. He has a 1.86 ERA in five
games, four of them starts, since signing with New York in June.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City starter Dan Reichert took a 2-1 lead into the
seventh, but walked Chuck Knoblauch and Derek Jeter to start the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Tim Byrdak struck out Paul O'Neill, then threw a wild
pitch in the dirt with Williams batting. The ball stayed at
Williams' feet, and catcher Gregg Zaun couldn't find it.
</P>
<P>
   With Byrdak pointing and shouting, the ball remained loose for
several seconds before Knoblauch took off and reached third without
a throw. Jeter remained at first.
</P>
<P>
   Williams followed with a hard grounder between third baseman Joe
Randa and the bag. The ball appeared to nick umpire Jim Reynolds
and slow down as it rolled to the corner.
</P>
<P>
   Without a fast carom, left fielder Mark Quinn needed extra time
to retrieve the ball, and that allowed Jeter to beat the relay
home.
</P>
<P>
   An error by Jeter at shortstop let the Royals take a 1-0 lead in
the fourth, but they ran themselves out of a big inning. Quinn was
thrown out trying to stretch a single, Rey Sanchez was trapped off
third on a grounder to Jeter and Randa was nailed trying to stretch
his RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Dave McCarty, subbing for Sweeney, doubled and scored on Zaun's
sacrifice fly for a 2-0 lead in the fifth. Jorge Posada had an RBI
grounder in the Yankees sixth.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Sweeney sustained a bruised right hand when hit by a pitch
Sunday from Tampa Bay's Esteban Yan. Sweeney had been the only
Royals player to start every game this season. Manager Tony Muser
does not expect Sweeney to play Wednesday afternoon, and hopes he
can return Thursday. ... Model Tyra Banks sat in the front row
behind the Royals dugout. No surprise, she was picked as ''Fan of
the Game'' on the video board during the seventh-inning stretch.
... Yankees RHP Orlando Hernandez, out since July 14 because of
elbow and back trouble, pitched four scoreless innings for Class A
Tampa. ... Brosius made a nifty pickup at third base on McCarty's
grounder and made a long, backhanded flip to get a forceout at
second.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Embassy To Move to Jerusalem  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- The United States plans to move its embassy
from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem by Jan. 20, the day President Clinton
leaves office, Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Barak told Israel television he understood the United States
''will rent offices by Jan. 20, and they will build an embassy.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about Barak's statement, State Department spokeswoman
Victoria DeLong and White House spokesman P.J. Crowley both said
they had no information that a final decision had been made on such
a move.
</P>
<P>
   The two officials referred back to Clinton's statement Friday
that he intends to review moving the embassy and that he will make
a decision by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Barak mentioned the embassy move as among the positive results
of the failed U.S.-mediated summit at Camp David with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the summit, Clinton said Friday he was putting
the embassy move ''under review and I'll make a decision sometime
between now and the end of the year on that.'' The statement
apparently aimed to support Barak, embattled by hard-liners at home
who say he offered too many concessions at Camp David.
</P>
<P>
   The embassy move would lend support to Israeli claims to the
city -- and would infuriate many in the Muslim world. Protests broke
out in some Palestinian cities after Clinton's statement and some
militant groups have threatened to target U.S. diplomats if the
United States moved its embassy.
</P>
<P>
   After the Camp David talks fell apart, Clinton also warned the
Palestinians not to follow through with their pledge to declare
statehood unilaterally on Sept. 13, if there is no agreement by
that deadline for a final peace deal. Clinton said the move would
be a ''big mistake'' and said the ''entire relationship'' with the
Palestinians would be reviewed.
</P>
<P>
   He also suggested the Palestinians were more to blame for the
failure of Camp David, by not moving as Israel had on the sensitive
issue of Jerusalem. Both sides softened positions on other core
issues, including refugees and borders.
</P>
<P>
   Barak agreed to extend limited sovereignty to the Palestinians
in some of the city's Arab neighborhoods. Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat insisted on full sovereignty throughout east Jerusalem,
including the ultrasensitive walled Old City, home to sites holy to
Muslims, Christians and Jews. Arafat has blamed Israel for the
summit's failure, saying he refused to go far enough on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   Barak said that the Muslim quarter of the Old City, and Sheik
Jarrah -- an Arab area abutting the walls of the Old City -- were not
on the table ''at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Not ruling out discussion of those areas was a large step by
Barak from the stance of earlier governments -- which long
considered those areas the sacred core of their commitment to
Jerusalem. Some in the Israeli opposition say Barak has gone too
far and are calling for early elections.
</P>
<P>
   Barak also said that a multibillion dollar fund set up by the
United States and European nations to compensate Palestinian made
refugees by Israel's 1948 independence war would also compensate
Jews driven out of Arab countries after the war.

<HEADLINE> Dole Pays Tribute to War Heroes  </HEADLINE>
By MIKE FEINSILBER
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Eyes glistening, Bob Dole spoke to the
Republican Party Tuesday on behalf of hundreds of thousands of
''voiceless heroes'' who never came home from wars. He said that
wearing this nation's uniform in battle was a greater honor than
winning his party's presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In paying tribute to his comrades in arms, Dole, 77, also hailed
young Americans, ''heroes in waiting.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Don't be fooled by their wardrobe or their music,'' he
advised. ''They are as great a generation as this nation has ever
produced.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Even as we meet, they are fighting quiet wars of their own,
combating poverty, prejudice, isolation and indulgence. My fondest
hope is that all their challenges are posed in community service,
in classrooms and research labs, not on foreign battlefields.''
</P>
<P>
   The moment could only have been emotional for both Dole and his
wife, Elizabeth. He was swamped by Bill Clinton in the presidential
election of 1996; she tried to win the GOP's presidential
nomination last year, but quit the race in October.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Dole was seated with former Presidents Ford and Bush. She
seemed to be wistful.
</P>
<P>
   In her own moment at the podium, Mrs. Dole saluted George W.
Bush, this convention's sure nominee, as one who will ''put an end
to the smash-mouth politics of recent years and to the name-calling
that tarnishes our trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Dole admitted having his voice catch toward the end of
his address as he talked about veterans. ''You try not to look at
people you know in the audience,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Dole was one of 671,846 U.S. servicemen wounded in combat in
World War II -- another 292,132 were killed -- and he said he was
''honored to speak for these voiceless heroes, and for their
comrades who survived the deadliest war ever inflicted on the human
family.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole virtually lost use of an arm in combat in Italy. His spine
was crushed, and his shoulder, arm and collarbone were broken. He
was unable to move and nearly bled to death.
</P>
<P>
   Dole expressed his determination to see the construction of a
memorial to World War II veterans on the Mall in Washington, near
the Lincoln Memorial, a controversial site.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the real memorial to servicemen was not made of
pillars or arches.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is to be found everywhere: at this convention and in the
upcoming one in Los Angeles, and in the November election, and
every time free men and women assemble to determine their
destiny.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole summed up why he remains -- as he proclaimed himself in 1996
-- ''the most optimistic man in America.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I have seen Americans split the atom, abolish Jim Crow,
eliminate the scourge of polio, win the Cold War, plant our flag on
the surface of the moon, belatedly recognize the talents of women
and others once relegated to the shadows, develop the Internet,
lead The Information Age, and map the human genome.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole started with a quip about his failed 1996 campaign:
''There's still time for a recount.''
</P>
<P>
   Then the band played the Army, Navy, Marine and Air Force
service anthems while veterans of those services stood. Dole got a
standing ovation. He finished, ''My fellow Americans, this proud
veteran salutes you.'' He gave the audience a crisp military salute
and marched off.

<HEADLINE> Obituaries in the News  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressWilliam Maxwell:
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- William Maxwell, the revered editor of such New
Yorker writers as J.D. Salinger and John Cheever and himself an
accomplished man of letters, died Monday. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell's death came eight days after the death of his wife,
Emily, to whom he was married for 55 years.
</P>
<P>
   Hired in 1937 by The New Yorker's Katharine White, a founding
editor and the wife of E.B. White, Maxwell was on staff for 40
years and worked with some of the magazine's most celebrated
authors, including Salinger, Cheever, John O'Hara, John Updike and
Harold Brodkey.
</P>
<P>
   In ''About Town,'' a history of The New Yorker published this
year, author Ben Yagoda noted that Maxwell's correspondence with
writers ''exudes a palpable empathy.'' For many, Maxwell was the
ideal editor, a man of civilized temperament and compassionate
rigor.
</P>
<P>
   Cheever and Brodkey were among those who dedicated books to
Maxwell.
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell's career as an author preceded his time at The New
Yorker. His first novel, ''Bright Center of Heaven,'' was published
in 1934. Subsequent books included the story collections ''Billie
Dyer'' and ''Over by the River,'' and the 1980 novel, ''So Long,
See You Tomorrow,'' which won the American Book Award.
Derek Hill:
</P>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Derek Hill, an English artist who did costume
designs for several well-known plays and painted portraits of
Prince Charles, died Sunday. He was 83.
</P>
<P>
   Hill's stage work includes costume designs for ''Castor and
Pollux'' at the Oxford University Opera Club in 1935, the ballet
''The Lord of Burleigh'' at Sadler's Wells in London in 1937 and
''Il Trovatore'' at Covent Garden in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   In 1956, he began to spend much of his time on Ireland's remote
Tory Island, based in a primitive hut, painting both the rugged
landscape and the people.
</P>
<P>
   Hill was made an honorary citizen of Ireland in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   He twice painted portraits of Prince Charles, and the two men
occasionally painted together.
</P>
<P>
   Other portrait subjects included Earl Mountbatten, Bernard
Berenson, Yehudi Menuhin, Michael Tippett, John Betjeman and
Frederick Ashton.
Leah Welch:
</P>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Leah Welch, who was paralyzed by polio in
1949 and later dedicated herself to making life better for people
with disabilities, died Friday. She was 76.
</P>
<P>
   Welch lobbied legislators and members of Congress on behalf of
the disabled and was invited to the White House to witness
President Bush sign the Americans With Disabilities Act in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being paralyzed from the neck down and spending her last
16 years on a ventilator, Welch was active and spoke frequently to
groups about the needs of disabled people.
</P>
<P>
   She founded Independence Crossroads, which helped find personal
care attendants for disabled people. The business now does mostly
in-home counseling and advocacy for the disabled.
John Wells:
</P>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- John Wells, a doctor and member of the established
St. Ives artists' community in England, died July 27. He was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Wells was raised in an artists' colony and went on to study
medicine while taking evening classes in life drawing. After
qualifying as a doctor, he set up a practice on the remote Scilly
Isles, off the southwest tip of England, continuing to paint part
time.
</P>
<P>
   Wells' work drew on the area's rugged landscape of sea and rock,
and was influenced by the Russian Constructivists, with their lines
and geometrical shapes.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, in which he served as a Royal Navy medial
officer, he took up painting full time.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, he founded the Crypt Group, a collection of modernists
within the community of St. Ives in Cornwall. He had his first
London show in 1946, and gained recognition in Britain and abroad
throughout the 1950s.
Pinkie Wilkerson:
</P>
<P>
   BOSSIER CITY, La. (AP) -- Democratic state Rep. Pinkie Wilkerson,
a three-term lawmaker and former state attorney general, was killed
Tuesday when a truck slammed into the back of her car. She was 52.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkerson had been a House member since 1992, representing all
or parts of Claiborne, Bienville, Lincoln and Union parishes.
</P>
<P>
   She was vice chairman of the House Health and Welfare Committee
and a member of the civil law and judiciary committees. She pushed
legislation dealing with child abuse and neglect, foster children
and battered women.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkerson had been slated to be a delegate to the Democratic
National Convention in Los Angeles this month. She was a delegate
to the 1996 party convention in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of her election to the House in 1991, Wilkerson was
an assistant district attorney and worked as an assistant state
attorney general during the 1980s.

<HEADLINE> Dole Is Back and He's Loose  </HEADLINE>
By CALVIN WOODWARD
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Leave it to Bob Dole to break through all
that's scripted at the Republican convention and drop a few ad
libs.
</P>
<P>
   Taking the stage Tuesday night to pay tribute to the military,
the 1996 Republican presidential candidate spoke without the weight
of expectations, having ''no agenda and no greater ambition.''
</P>
<P>
   That seems to have loosened him up.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's still time for a recount,'' he cracked, referring to
his sound defeat at the hands of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He said South Carolina Sen. Strom Thurmond, 97, ''took me to
Constitution Hall and showed me where he first met Ben Franklin.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1996 campaign, Dole has been busy raising money for a
World War II memorial on Washington's Mall, serving as an
intermediary in the Balkans, writing a book on political humor and
making commercials for a male impotence drug.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota: ''Land of 10,000 lakes and one goofy governor!''
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska: ''Only state never visited by Bill Clinton since he's
been president!''
</P>
<P>
   The roll call of the states, the way the nominee is officially
chosen, is different this year, spread out over three nights
instead of packed into one.
</P>
<P>
   But it's still a chance for delegates to make a plug for the
home state and take a swipe at the other party.
</P>
<P>
   ''Massachusetts: Bedrock of Republicanism,'' it was boldly
announced by a representative of that Democratic state.
</P>
<P>
   Maine was declared ''Governor Bush's beachhead.'' The convention
was told: ''As Maine goes, so goes the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Clinton's no-show in Nebraska, the White House has said
he hopes to get there eventually.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Someone batted a red, white and blue beach ball up to Bush's
running mate, Dick Cheney, sitting with his family in the first row
above the floor.
</P>
<P>
   He caught it and didn't seem to know quite what to do with it.
He held it for a minute, then put it down, eventually passing it
along to one of his grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Mass. Delegate Sticks With McCain  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Dr. Dwight Stowell Jr. knew it was a vote
wasted, but the Massachusetts delegate cast his ballot for Sen.
John McCain anyway at the Republican convention Tuesday, going
against McCain's own wishes.
</P>
<P>
   After two days of balloting, Stowell is the only delegate to
support McCain instead of Texas Gov. George W. Bush. Six votes have
been cast for Alan Keyes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought about it a lot and I've been hammered all day by
McCain's own people to vote for Bush, but in the end I took a page
out of John's book,'' said Stowell, a physician from Royalston,
Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said that there are some issues that are greater than the
individual, and so I just decided to go ahead and do what I thought
was right.''
</P>
<P>
   Stowell said he wanted to send a message to Bush about the need
for campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want him to be elected but we want him to be elected
talking about campaign finance reform,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain defeated George W. Bush in Massachusetts' March primary.
Before the convention, McCain asked all his supporters to unite
behind Bush. Charles Shemchuk of Athol, another Massachusetts
delegate who had backed McCain, abstained.

<HEADLINE> Fire Blackens Mexico Baja Peninsula  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TECATE, Mexico (AP) -- Mexican army and navy units have joined
firefighters in battling a blaze that has blackened 37,000 acres in
a remote mountainous area near the U.S. border, an official said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The fire crews have the blaze in northern Baja California state
70 percent controlled and expect to have it under full control by
the end of the week, said Alfredo Escobedo, the director of the
Baja California Office of Civil Protection.
</P>
<P>
   The size of the fire makes it among the worst in the last 10
years in Baja California, but few people live in the area and it
does not pose a significant threat to any communities, Escobedo
said.
</P>
<P>
   Three firefighters suffered minor injuries in the fire, 30 miles
south of the U.S.-Mexico border in the Sierra de Juarez, the
mountain chain that runs down the center of the Baja peninsula.
</P>
<P>
   A man who may have caused the fire by allowing a campfire to get
out of control has been taken into custody by state authorities, he
said.

<HEADLINE> Wrongful Death Suit Filed in Denver  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Sheriff deputies did not prevent the rescue of a
teacher who bled to death at Columbine High School during last
year's massacre, county officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Sanders, daughter of teacher Dave Sanders, filed a
wrongful death suit against the county, saying sheriff commanders
prevented anyone from trying to rescue her father for nearly four
hours while he bled to death.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed Dave Sanders and 12
students April 20, 1999, before committing suicide. Sanders, 47,
was shot twice in the shoulder as he guided students from the
school's library to safety.
</P>
<P>
   In a motion released Tuesday, county officials conceded the
teacher did not get medical attention but said two separate SWAT
teams were sent into the building, contradicting Angela Sanders'
claim that officials blocked any attempt to rescue her father.
</P>
<P>
   The motion also said the sheriff's department did not put her
father in danger or make his situation worse.
</P>
<P>
   The county's lawyers said the lawsuit is equivalent to an
allegation of negligence, ''which does not amount to a
constitutionally recognized claim'' against county officials.
</P>
<P>
   Angela Sanders did not return a phone call Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Columbine victims' families have filed 15 lawsuits over the
shootings. The suits accuse officials of mishandling their
response, ignoring advance warnings and killing one of the victims
with errant shots.

<HEADLINE> Bronx serial rapist gets 155 years to life  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - The serial rapist who police were looking for
the night Amadou Diallo was shot in the Bronx was sentenced Tuesday
to 155 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Issac Jones, 39, denied being the rapist who terrorized women in
the Bronx, Manhattan and Mount Vernon during a crime spree that
started in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Bronx District Attorney Robert Johnson said in a statement: ''By
denying the charges at the time of sentencing, in the face of DNA
evidence and his own confession, it is clear that this defendant
still thinks only of himself. His violent penchant for
self-gratification has caused tremendous damage to the lives of
others.''
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested Jones in April after DNA evidence linked him to
17 attacks on women. He was the suspect four Street Crime Unit
police officers were looking for when they shot and killed an
unarmed Diallo on Feb. 4, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was convicted on May 2 on several counts of rape, sexual
abuse, robbery and criminal possession of a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   State Supreme Court Justice Joseph Fisch heard sentencing
recommendations on Monday, including a statement from one of Jones'
victims asking ''that he receive the highest sentence applicable by
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisch rendered his decision Tuesday, saying he had ''removed
from society a cruel, merciless and dangerous predator who has
ruined many lives and terrorized the community and its honest,
law-abiding citizens for far too many years.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones is still awaiting trial on four other indictments
involving 16 victims in the Bronx, and cases are pending in
Manhattan and Westchester County involving five additional victims.

<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A four-star general, two war heroes and a Cold War
expert lined up on a star-spangled night to reassure the public that Texas Gov.

Nearly 50 Killed in Kashmir Attacks

   SRINAGAR, India (AP) -- Suspected Islamic guerrillas killed nearly 50 people
in two separate attacks in India's troubled Kashmir, authorities said Wednesday.
In the latest violence, the attackers raided a village late Tuesday in the
Anantnag area of central Kashmir, lining up and shooting to death 18 men, the
Press Trust of India reported. Those killed were workers at a brick factory who
had migrated from other Indian states for work, the agency said. That bloodshed
came hours after 30 unarmed Hindu pilgrims and Muslims porters were killed by
the suspected rebels as the group made its way to a religious shrine in the
disputed state.

   TOPEKA, Kan. (AP) -- Candidates for the Kansas Board of Education who support
new science standards that de-emphasize evolution trailed in early returns in
two races Tuesday and led in a third. Three conservatives who voted for the new
standards were being challenged in Republican primaries by moderates who opposed
the decision; a conservative and a moderate also squared off in a GOP primary
for an open seat on the board. Linda Holloway, who supported the new standards
as board chairwoman last year, trailed Sue Gamble 63 percent to 37 percent, with
4 percent of the votes reported.

   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's new president was inaugurated Tuesday and pledged
to maintain peace at home while Israel's government pursues peace with its
neighbors. ''I believe you chose me to bring peace among us,'' Moshe Katsav told
legislators, adding that making peace with the Arabs was best left to parliament
and the Cabinet. That was a veiled reference to former Prime Minister and Nobel
peace laureate Shimon Peres, whom Katsav defeated Monday in a poll of the
Knesset's 120 legislators.

   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- The Vatican Museums open their doors Aug. 10 to an
exhibit commemorating Holocaust diarist Anne Frank. The Aug. 10-Sept. 11

in Amsterdam. The choice of exhibits ''ideally reinforces the dialogue between
Catholics and Jews, which in recent years has made significant steps forward,''
the Vatican Council for Culture said.

Details of E-Mail Spy System Sought
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A privacy group asked a federal judge Tuesday to order the
release of details concerning the government's ''Carnivore'' e-mail surveillance
system. The Washington-based Electronic Privacy Information Center accused the
FBI of not moving fast enough to act on the group's Freedom of Information Act
request for the information. EPIC asked on July 12 that the information,
including the inner workings of Carnivore, be fast-tracked through a portion of
FOIA that allows for ''expedited processing,'' a 10-day time limit for
responding to requests. The Justice Department has not responded, EPIC said.
