<HEADLINE> Helen Mirren Praised for 'Passion' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- You expect her to be kind of tough. Guarded.  
Grave. 
</P>
<P>
	After all, for years you followed her as Jane Tennison, the  
driven Scotland Yard detective on public television's ``Prime 
Suspect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now you find her playing novelist-philosopher Ayn Rand, the  
relentless author of those objectivist doorstops, ``The 
Fountainhead'' and ``Atlas Shrugged.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A pair of formidable women!  
</P>
<P>
	Yet here you are, positively charmed by Helen Mirren, your lunch  
companion, who, when you confess that you've arrived without your 
glasses and can't read the menu, recommends her sure-fire system: 
Go to the drugstore and buy dozens of those inexpensive glasses and 
stash them everywhere. Then you'll never be without. 
</P>
<P>
	She fishes in her purse to show you one of her countless pairs,  
only to find them missing. She dissolves into laughter. 
</P>
<P>
	You don't need your glasses to see that Mirren disappears into a  
role, be it in one of her many features or on the stage with 
Britain's Royal Shakespeare Company. Indeed, some of her best work 
is invisible, the way she somehow intimates Tennison's 
vulnerability, however fiercely it's hidden from the world. 
</P>
<P>
	Mirren demonstrates her powers once again in ``The Passion of  
Ayn Rand,'' premiering on Showtime at 8 p.m. EDT Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The film begins in Los Angeles in 1951, shortly after the  
publication of Rand's best-selling novel ``The Fountainhead.'' A 
UCLA psychology student, Nathaniel Branden (Eric Stoltz), arranges 
to meet her to discuss her philosophy of objectivism. 
</P>
<P>
	Branden and his fiancee Barbara (Julie Delpy) form an almost  
instant bond with Rand and her pliant, flower-growing husband Frank 
O'Connor (Peter Fonda). But the connection isn't purely 
intellectual. Soon, Branden and Rand, despite the quarter-century 
that separates their ages, initiate a lengthy love affair -- having 
logically arranged the consent of their spouses. 
</P>
<P>
	So goes objectivism.  
</P>
<P>
	A half-century later, Rand has legions of admirers (from college  
freshmen to Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan) who have 
absorbed her doctrine of unfettered capitalism, her conviction that 
selfishness is a virtue and altruism a vice. 
</P>
<P>
	But Helen Mirren, who was born in London 53 years ago, tells you  
she had scarcely heard of Ayn (rhymes with ``sign'') Rand before 
the project came her way. 
</P>
<P>
	No matter. ``It was quickly apparent that here was an incredible  
character of the 20th century, one who happens to be woman, which 
makes it better, and one who happens to be a dumpy little 
unattractive woman -- even better!'' 
</P>
<P>
	She laughs at maybe having oversimplified.  
</P>
<P>
	``Ayn could be charming, girly, twinkly,'' Mirren adds. ``She  
wasn't -- what do you call it? -- a battle-ax. Although she could be. 
She could be ferocious. There are some fabulous contradictions 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To inhabit the Russian-born Rand, she affected a cigarette  
holder and trilled her R's. Her blond hair went brunet. Even her 
blue eyes were transformed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wore black contact lenses, because she had these very black,  
shiny eyes. Everyone who saw her talked about how extraordinary 
they were, and I thought that was important. But then I was playing 
the whole thing through this dark, blurry haze: 'Is that Peter 
Fonda over there? I THINK so.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Impersonation was only the beginning. ``To me, that's not  
acting. Acting is something more'' -- and, with delight, she borrows 
a word she heard Roberto Benigni coin -- ``more mysterical! 
Mysterical, isn't that a great word? I'm going to use it for the 
rest of my life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although Mirren concedes an inability to slog through Rand's  
novels -- ``I'm so impressed with American education that 
19-year-olds here can read this stuff!'' -- she found a key to the 
role in one of Rand's early diaries. There, in private, Rand 
resolved always to keep her feelings in check. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that was what she was doing her whole life: trying to  
control emotions that were so huge, much bigger than with most of 
us. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ayn was very honest about herself, yet at the same time, very  
un-self-aware,'' Mirren says. ``For someone who deconstructed and 
examined and tried to control everything, there was this enormous 
weight of humanity within her that she couldn't deconstruct or 
control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This unintended passion is what sparked her affair with  
Nathaniel Brand. And that, in turn, begat some steamy scenes in the 
film. 
</P>
<P>
	``I asked for them to be put in, actually. Because they weren't  
in the original script. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's awful having to do them, especially if you're not  
unbelievably gorgeous,'' Mirren confides with cheery dread. ``But 
here, for once, it was intrinsic to the story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even without glasses, you can see what she means. The mysterical  
Helen Mirren is that kind of actress. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere in television ...  
</P>
<P>
	`20/20': ``Over the years, people have asked me what the most  
memorable interview I have ever done was,'' says Barbara Walters. 
``It is not a president or a king or a movie star. It is a man I 
interviewed more than 25 years ago. He was a teacher and a poet, 
and the most inspirational person I have ever met.'' On tonight's 
``20/20,'' Walters revisits Robert Smithdas, who is now married to 
a woman who, like him, is deaf and blind. The report airs at 10 
p.m. EDT on ABC. Also, correspondent Arnold Diaz advises consumers 
to read the fine print in advertising. Looking closely at several 
print and television spots, he demonstrates how some offers that 
seem too good to be true often are.

<HEADLINE> Charged S.C. Man Says He Was Drunk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KINGSTREE, S.C. (AP) -- One of two men accused of grabbing a man  
by the arm and dragging him alongside their pickup truck told 
police that he was drunk and couldn't remember much. 
</P>
<P>
	Eric W. Jones told police he and Arthur Marshall split a 12-pack  
of beer after work and all he remembers is the truck going into a 
ditch and then running through the woods, according to a police 
document reviewed Friday by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Charone Green, 23, suffered leg and arm injuries but was not  
seriously hurt. He told police he was dragged for nearly a quarter 
mile. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones, 38, and Marshall, 34, were charged with assault and  
battery with intent to kill. Marshall also was charged with 
possession of a stolen vehicle -- the pickup. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the two were ordered held in jail on $200,000 bond.  
</P>
<P>
	Williamsburg County Sheriff Kelvin Washington said he has found  
no evidence that the incident was racially motivated -- Jones and 
Marshall are white, and Green is black. The State Law Enforcement 
Division and the Federal Bureau of Investigation are looking into 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Green was grabbed and dragged when he  
approached a pickup truck that had slowed in front of his cousin's 
house on a rural road in the Bloomingvale community, about 90 miles 
east of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	A witness said Green broke free when the truck hit a culvert.  
</P>
<P>
	Washington backed off an earlier statement that drugs may have  
been involved. Green said there were no drugs involved, and he 
wasn't sure there was any racial motivation to the attack.

<HEADLINE> Larry Flynt Drops Slander Lawsuit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Hustler magazine publisher Larry Flynt and his  
brother have agreed to drop their slander lawsuit against a former 
prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	Flynt, 56, and his brother, Jimmy, 50, said there was no point  
in pursuing their case against former Hamilton County Prosecutor 
Joseph Deters. 
</P>
<P>
	The Flynts claimed Deters, now Ohio's treasurer, damaged their  
reputations by linking them to an attempt to bribe a potential 
witness in their obscenity trial. The Flynts denied knowing the man 
who pleaded guilty to paying the bribe. 
</P>
<P>
	The obscenity case was settled this month when the Flynts'  
Cincinnati store was allowed to plead guilty to two counts of 
pandering obscenity.

<HEADLINE> Injuries Hit Stars and Avalanche </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- A series of injuries struck the Dallas Stars and  
the Colorado Avalanche in Game 4 of their Western Conference final 
series Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche scratched left wing Valeri Kamensky, who sprained  
his right wrist in Game 3, and then lost right wing Milan Hejduk to 
a broken collar bone midway through the first period. 
</P>
<P>
	Hejduk, a strong rookie of the year candidate, was taken from  
McNichols Arena in an ambulance after being checked hard into the 
boards by Dallas defenseman Richard Matvichuk. A team spokesman 
said after the game that Hejduk would be out for the rest of the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Hejduk has six goals and five assists in the playoffs.  
</P>
<P>
	Dallas forward Guy Carbonneau left the game late in the second  
period after his right leg got caught under the skate of Colorado's 
Dale Hunter. Carbonneau writhed on the ice before walking off on 
his own power and returned for the third period. 
</P>
<P>
	Kamensky sparked the Avalanche in the second round as they won  
four straight against Detroit after his return from a broken right 
forearm. 
</P>
<P>
	Injuries continued in the third period before Colorado won 3-2  
in overtime. Matvichuk was forced to leave the game with an 
apparent leg injury after a pileup at the boards with Colorado 
center Peter Forsberg, who was shaken up on the play. 
</P>
<P>
	Matvichuk returned for overtime.

<HEADLINE> Botha Appeals in Truth Panel Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) -- Lawyers for P.W. Botha, white  
South Africa's last hard-line president, began an appeal Friday 
against his conviction for ignoring a summons to appear before a 
panel probing apartheid atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year Botha was fined the equivalent of $1,575 and given a  
one-year suspended jail sentence for failing to show up at a 
hearing of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission which wanted to 
grill him on his 11 years in power. 
</P>
<P>
	Botha's lawyer Lappe Laubscher said the appeal would be based on  
technicalities that invalidated the subpoena issued by the Truth 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Repeating arguments put forward in the original court case,  
Laubscher said the panel had not followed its own rules in drawing 
up the summons. 
</P>
<P>
	``You cannot convict a person on the basis of an invalid  
subpoena,'' he said ``That is just going too far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Botha, who lives in retirement in a coastal village about 310  
miles from Cape Town, was not present at the hearing, which is 
expected to last at least two days. 
</P>
<P>
	Botha ruled with an iron fist until 1989, when he was ousted in  
an internal party struggle after he suffered a stroke and was 
replaced by the more liberal F.W. de Klerk. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the Truth Commission has completed its work and there is  
no chance Botha will testify before it, the panel did succeed in 
turning his case into a forum for confronting him with evidence of 
horrific abuses committed during his rule.

<HEADLINE> Bush Plans Skydive for His Birthday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Former President Bush's plans to skydive  
again don't strike his eldest son, Gov. George W. Bush, as a great 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
	The ex-president plans to celebrate his 75th birthday three days  
early on June 9 by leaping from an airplane at an altitude of 
12,500 feet. He plans to land on the grounds of his presidential 
library at Texas A&AMP;M University in College Station. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the only former president to have parachuted, has done it  
twice before. The first was when his bomber was shot down during 
World War II; the second two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Bush said he wasn't worried about his father when asked  
Friday about the third jump. But he added: ``I agree with my 
mother's assessment when they named the Central Intelligence Agency 
building after him. She said, `I can't believe they'd be naming any 
facility with the word intelligence in it after George Bush.''' 
</P>
<P>
	As in his 1997 jump, the elder Bush will be harnessed to two  
veteran jumpers but will land on his own, said Dany Brooks, 
spokeswoman for the U.S. Parachute Association, which is organizing 
the event.

<HEADLINE> FTC Targets Bogus Talent Scouts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The phony talent scout approaches the mother  
and her toddler in the mall and says the child has the looks to be 
a model in TV commercials. The scout leaves a card and urges her to 
make an appointment. 
</P>
<P>
	But instead of a start on the road to stardom, the meeting  
becomes a high-pressure sales pitch coercing the mother to pay for 
expensive modeling classes and photo shoots, according to the 
Federal Trade Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	In a string of recent cases, the FTC is cracking down on  
fraudulent talent agencies and warning consumers to be wary of 
flattery. 
</P>
<P>
	A hearing is scheduled today in U.S. District Court in  
Alexandria, Va., in a suit filed by the commission against three 
modeling firms accused of operating together ``to induce consumers 
to purchase their talent management services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its complaint, the commission alleges that the Model 1 Inc.,  
Erickson Agency Inc. and Creative Talent Management Inc. falsely 
represented themselves as selectively scouting for models and 
actors, when in fact the companies accept all candidates who make a 
deposit. Contrary to the claims of the companies, consumers also 
were unlikely to receive substantial earnings as models or actors, 
the commission said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the FTC charged another business -- Screen Test  
U.S.A. -- with using a screen test for children to con parents into 
buying company products. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents who saw television, radio or Internet ads and called the  
company were told to bring their children in for a $45 screen test. 
After the company informed parents that their children had passed 
the screen test, scouts put pressure on the families to buy 
packages of photographs ranging from $495 to $795. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the commission, the firm, based in Wayne, N.J.,  
with branches along the East Coast, also falsely claimed that 
children were more likely to be signed by well-known talent 
agencies through the company. 
</P>
<P>
	``This screen test was a smokescreen,'' said Jodie Bernstein,  
director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. ``Consumers 
who bought products and services from these individuals thought 
they were getting good advice from seasoned professionals, and they 
weren't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the FTC charged that Screen Test failed to follow  
the ``cooling off'' rule, which allows consumers some rights to 
cancel services when companies conduct their businesses at 
locations other than their permanent offices. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal court in New Jersey has temporarily halted the  
company's operations and frozen its assets. A preliminary hearing 
seeking an injunction against the company is scheduled for June. 
</P>
<P>
	Messages left at the company's headquarters and lawyer's office  
were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, at the commission's request, a federal court  
in New Jersey barred National Talent Associates Inc. from 
misrepresenting its ability to find high-paying modeling and acting 
jobs for children. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fairfield, N.J., company had agreed to settle commission  
charges initially filed in 1974 by agreeing to disclose specified 
information and provide consumers with a three-day cooling-off 
period when signing a contract. But the FTC charged that the 
company violated this consent order. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the court injunction, National Talent Associates cannot  
misrepresent the expertise of its sales agents in picking out 
potential models or entertainers. The defendants, who also have 
offices in Philadelphia, New York, Chicago and Minneapolis, have 
been ordered to pay a $160,000 civil penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	NTA declined to comment on the case.

<HEADLINE> Prosecutors Rest in Torture Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Abner Louima says there were two police officers  
in the stationhouse bathroom where he was tortured. Justin Volpe 
has admitted he was one. But who was the other? 
</P>
<P>
	That question hangs heavily over the federal courtroom where  
four officers still face charges in connection with the attack that 
seriously injured the Haitian immigrant two summers ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The prosecution rested Thursday after a month-long case  
featuring testimony by 50 witnesses and one dramatic guilty plea. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, with the jury off, Volpe admitted publicly for the  
first time that he rammed a stick into a handcuffed Louima's 
rectum, pulled it out and put it up to his face in a fit of rage. 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe, 27, said he believed -- mistakenly -- that the Haitian  
immigrant had punched him when police tried to quell a disturbance 
outside a Brooklyn nightclub on Aug. 9, 1997. He also said a second 
police officer in the bathroom ``saw what was going on and did 
nothing to stop it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Volpe, who is now in federal custody awaiting sentencing, wasn't  
required to name the officer. Nor was the jury told of his 
statements, but were notified that he pleaded guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say Officer Charles Schwarz held Louima, 32, down  
during the bathroom assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwarz is also accused, along with Officers Thomas Wiese and  
Thomas Bruder, of beating Louima in a patrol car en route to the 
station after his arrest on false charges he punched Volpe. Sgt. 
Michael Bellomo, their supervisor, is charged with covering up the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Eugene Nickerson dismissed motions by all the defendants  
Thursday to throw out the case based on insufficient evidence. Two 
of the four defense attorneys also rested; the others are expected 
to conclude their cases sometime next week. The trial resumes 
Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler Announces Recall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG is recalling  
nearly 1 million minivans to check for short circuits that have 
caused air bags to inflate inadvertently. 
</P>
<P>
	The voluntary recall of 996,939 vehicles affects the Dodge  
Caravan, Plymouth Voyager and Chrysler Town &AMP; Country for the model 
years 1994-95, the automaker announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall announced Friday comes after about 35 reports of  
inadvertent deployment of driver's side air bags caused by a short 
in the wiring harness. Most of the incidents occurred when the 
vehicle was started. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been no reported injuries.  
</P>
<P>
	Owners of the vehicles are expected to be notified in about a  
month. Any wiring shorts in the airbag systems will be repaired at 
no cost to owners, DaimlerChrysler said.

<HEADLINE> Market Softens for Internet Mergers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- GeoCities Inc. shareholders said yes Friday to  
merging their company with Yahoo! Inc., but they're getting a lot 
less than they once thought. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo!, a leading Internet search and directory service, is  
acquiring GeoCities, a company that helps consumers create their 
own Web pages, by issuing 27.4 million shares of stock. 
</P>
<P>
	However, since the deal was announced in January, Internet  
stocks have plunged. That means the Yahoo! shares that were once 
worth $5.04 billion are now valued at $4.06 billion, a 19 percent 
drop. 
</P>
<P>
	The bear market in Internet shares has sharply reduced the value  
of a handful of mergers in the works. Web companies have fallen 29 
percent since mid-April, causing many investors and executives to 
re-think their options. The downward price pressure could put some 
deals in jeopardy and change the structure of future mergers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Small deals will definitely happen, but the big deals, north  
of $200 million, they will slow down for the very short term to see 
where the market's going,'' said Alan Braverman, a senior managing 
director at Banc of America Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Companies with weak stocks and balance sheets may be forced into  
mergers, while stronger companies go bargain hunting using cash 
instead of shares. Investors, for their part, will be looking 
closer at the value of the shares they're getting. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! is already moving to prove to investors there are  
synergies in Friday's deal. Yahoo! is dismissing about 200 
employees from GeoCities, or two-thirds of the company's staff, and 
is moving the headquarters from Los Angeles to Yahoo!'s base in 
Santa Clara, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	``The opportunity for shareholders of GeoCities remains  
strong,'' said Steve Hansen, chief operating officer of GeoCities. 
``Yahoo is a terrific currency to own.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course Internet stocks are known to swing wildly, and not all  
Internet deals have lost ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Shareholders of Excite Inc., another Internet search and  
directory service, on Friday approved the company's merger with At 
Home Corp., which delivers high-speed Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	Excite investors will receive 61 million shares of At Home's  
stock, worth $7.06 billion, or $700 million more than when the deal 
was announced in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, many industry watchers expect Internet stocks to  
swoon throughout the summer. The flood of new Internet companies is 
spreading investment dollars thin, while some money managers 
traditionally dump volatile stocks during vacation months when 
trading volumes drop and it is harder to buy and sell shares. 
</P>
<P>
	And next month, the Russell 2000 small company stock index will  
kick out several Internet companies because they've grown too big. 
Mutual funds that track the index are expected to sell up to $68 
billion worth of Internet stocks, according to L. Keith Mullins, 
emerging growth strategist for Salomon Smith Barney. 
</P>
<P>
	The companies have not been identified, but could include the  
brokers e-Trade Group Inc. and Ameritrade Holding Corp., the 
audio/video company RealNetworks Inc. and the advertising company 
DoubleClick Inc., among others. 
</P>
<P>
	If Internet stocks keep falling, skittish investors, many of  
them buying stocks with borrowed money, may scatter. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Theory of Crowds says everybody will run the other way,  
and suddenly no one will see any value,'' said John ``Hans'' 
Morris, who heads the mergers and acquisitions practice at Salomon 
Smith Barney. 
</P>
<P>
	Small investors could play a critical role in the direction of  
future mergers and acquisitions. They have already shown their 
power. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, media entrepreneur Barry Diller called off plans  
to combine his Home Shopping Network with Lycos Inc., another 
Internet search and directory service, after investors pounded the 
stock and criticized the deal in Internet chat groups and message 
boards. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, the announced mergers are expected to get shareholder  
approval, although some investors are concerned about their losses. 
</P>
<P>
	On one stock message board on the Internet, known as Raging  
Bull, investors in Broadcast.com are looking at the drop in 
Yahoo!'s stock with wide eyes. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! offered to buy Broadcast.com, which distributes audio and  
video programing over the Internet, in April for $6.11 billion. On 
Friday, that deal was worth $5.03 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	One Broadcast.com investor, known as sueg10077, had looked  
forward to getting shares in Yahoo! 
</P>
<P>
	``I convinced my husband to keep this, because of Yahoo, when we  
could have made some big bucks (by selling after the deal was 
announced),'' she wrote. ``Give me some consolation. Please!!!''

<HEADLINE> GOP Tries To Keep Majority United </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Republicans bumped up against the  
reality of their slender majority this week, and the results were 
stark. Two bills were derailed, two more postponed and several GOP 
lawmakers broke ranks on campaign finance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any time six people get up in the morning and decide they  
don't like what the leadership's doing we've got a real problem,'' 
Rep. Ray LaHood, R-Ill., said after the rank and file held a long 
closed-door meeting on Thursday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a hard job,'' he added.  
</P>
<P>
	The Republican majority is 222-211, with one independent who  
customarily votes with the Democrats and one vacancy. That means 
that on any issue, five GOP defections can deadlock the House and a 
sixth can deliver control of the floor to the Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	And Democrats, eager to underscore every Republican weakness in  
hopes of gaining control of the House in 2000, aren't likely to 
help much. That's particularly true on GOP-drafted spending bills, 
about which Democratic leader Dick Gephardt said recently, ``This 
is their budget and I assume they're going to implement it. If they 
want to change it, we're happy to go to the floor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In public, Republicans seek to shift the focus to their one  
solid accomplishment of the past week, passage of a measure to 
safeguard Social Security surpluses. They also blame some of the 
week's problems on the Democrats, who they say reneged on promises 
to deliver votes. 
</P>
<P>
	But inside the closed-door meeting, according to several sources  
who spoke on condition of anonymity, the Republicans discussed the 
need to work cohesively to save their majority. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. George Nethercutt of Washington reminded everyone that he  
was in Congress because he had defeated former Rep. Thomas Foley, 
then speaker in a Democratic-controlled House. 
</P>
<P>
	One lawmaker who attended the meeting said Nethercutt cautioned  
that if they weren't careful, Republicans would end up ``creating 
the media appearance that the leadership is ineffective.'' That, 
Nethercutt said, was precisely what allowed him to beat Foley six 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP whip, Tom DeLay of Texas, according to several  
participants, said punishment of rebels isn't feasible. But these 
participants said he added that any chairman who defies the 
leadership on a range of key procedural votes should resign his or 
her committee or subcommittee chairmanship. 
</P>
<P>
	That comment seemed aimed, in part at least, at the six who  
broke ranks and signed onto the Democratic effort to force campaign 
finance legislation to the floor. Most of them hold subcommittee 
chairmanships; no offers of resignation were reported. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the six, Chris Shays of Connecticut, said earlier in the  
week that DeLay had offered to help anyone who decided to challenge 
him in a Republican primary. DeLay's office denied it. 
</P>
<P>
	The situation on the floor seemed to lurch from one problem to  
another for the Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	A spending bill for agriculture was pulled after two days of  
delaying tactics by a small group of conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``Leadership believes it is more important to stick to the  
calendar, even when that may mean sacrificing good policy 
(controlling spending) and great politics (saving 100% of Social 
Security),'' Tom Coburn of Oklahoma wrote fellow Republicans in 
explanation of his actions. 
</P>
<P>
	GOP moderates worry about the spending bills yet to come, but  
their concern is there won't be enough money. 
</P>
<P>
	Reps. Mike Castle of Delaware and John Porter of Illinois wrote  
the president and the House GOP leadership suggesting that ``talks 
begin immediately on a budget and appropriations agreement for this 
year to avoid a likely impasse'' this fall. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending bills aside, a major defense measure was shelved when  
it became clear the GOP leaders couldn't prevail on a routine 
parliamentary vote to set rules for floor debate. 
</P>
<P>
	As approved in committee, the bill would cut off money for the  
air war in Kosovo after Sept. 30. Clinton threatened a veto, and 
Hastert agreed to remove the offending provision without a debate. 
</P>
<P>
	That infuriated GOP critics of the Yugoslavia campaign. In  
addition, some Western Republicans were angry that the leaders had 
accommodated environmental-minded lawmakers on another part of the 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	And some Democrats complained that they wouldn't be allowed a  
vote on a proposal for dealing with alleged Chinese espionage. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, a measure designed to showcase Republican resolve  
in beefing up the military was put off until later in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll have a long discussion and debate on Kosovo and a debate  
on China'' when Congress returns in June, Hastert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Given the events of the week, two other minor measures that  
Republicans had hoped to pass never made it to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
	On campaign finance, Shays and five other Republicans defied the  
leadership and signed a Democratic-drafted petition to force 
legislation to the floor as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Hastert offered a date of mid-September, but advocates of the  
measure say that will be too late to allow them to exert enough 
pressure in the Senate to overcome a threatened filibuster.

<HEADLINE> Duval To Make Return at Memorial  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ohio (AP) -- David Duval, the world's top-ranked golfer,  
will return to the PGA Tour next week at the Memorial Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Duval hasn't played since missing the cut three weeks ago at the  
Compaq Classic of New Orleans. Duval, who has four tournament wins 
this year, said he needed a mental break and took the last two tour 
events off. 
</P>
<P>
	The break will end Thursday in the opening round at Muirfield  
Village Golf Club. International Management Group of Cleveland, 
which represents Duval, confirmed Duval's participation Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The tournament will also feature Columbus native Jack Nicklaus,  
who designed the Muirfield course and has won the tournament twice 
in its 23-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	Fred Couples, who won the tournament last year, will try to  
become the first player to successfully defend the Memorial title.

<HEADLINE> Holyfield-Lewis Fight in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis will fight a  
rematch for the undisputed heavyweight title in Las Vegas in 
November. Exactly when and where, though, remains to be decided. 
</P>
<P>
	A new deal between boxing promoter Don King and a major casino  
operator means the fight will take place in Las Vegas, most likely 
on Nov. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	King and Park Place Entertainment Corp. announced earlier this  
week that they have agreed to an 18-fight deal that includes the 
Holyfield-Lewis rematch. 
</P>
<P>
	Park Place owns the Las Vegas Hilton, Flamingo Hilton and  
Bally's in Las Vegas. It has also agreed to buy Caesar's Palace. 
</P>
<P>
	Park Place officials say the fight will either be at one of  
those properties or be held as a joint venture with another Las 
Vegas resort, presumably the new Mandalay Bay. Park Place was a 
co-host at Mandalay Bay of the Oscar De La Hoya-Oba Carr 
welterweight title fight last week. 
</P>
<P>
	If casino officials have their way, the Holyfield-Lewis fight  
would be on Nov. 6, which is seen as a better tourism weekend for 
the city. But HBO, which will televise it via pay-per-view on its 
TVKO network, wants it on Nov. 13 and has already tentatively 
scheduled it for that date.

<HEADLINE> Novelist Alice Adams Dead at 72 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Alice Adams, a longtime short story writer  
for The New Yorker and a novelist whose ``Superior Women'' became a 
best seller, has died at 72. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Adams, well known for 10 novels and five short story  
collections, had been treated for heart problems earlier in the 
week and apparently died in her sleep Thursday, said her editor, 
Victoria Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was just so deft and had such a wonderful touch,'' said  
Ms. Wilson, her editor at Knopf. ``She was a master of condensing 
so much, with so much resonance into a short form.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``No one wrote better about the tangled relations of men and  
women or about the enduring romance of friendship,'' Fran Kiernan, 
who edited Ms. Adams's stories in The New Yorker, told The New York 
Times. ``She was a great romantic, with the highest expectations of 
life. As a writer, she was unfailingly wise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some reviewers, however, found her writing mannered and  
humorless. 
</P>
<P>
	One more novel, ``After the War,'' will be published next year.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Adams was born in Fredericksburg, Va., and grew up in Chapel  
Hill, N.C., where her father taught Spanish at the University of 
North Carolina. She graduated from Radcliffe College at age 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Her first novel, ``Careless Love,'' was met with mixed reviews,  
but after publishing her first story for The New Yorker in 1969, 
Ms. Adams became one of the magazine's most distinctive voices. 
</P>
<P>
	Her 1975 novel ``Families and Survivors,'' about a woman who  
moves from the South to San Francisco, as Ms. Adams herself did, 
established her as an important literary presence. ``Listening to 
Billie'' followed in 1978, then came the short story collection 
``Beautiful Girl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Superior Women,'' which traced the lives of five Radcliffe  
women, in 1984 became a best seller. 
</P>
<P>
	Known for her wry perspective on life, Ms. Adams once ruminated  
on the difficulty of writing as one ages: ``Some smart person once 
said that what happens is your critical standards rise, and your 
talent does not necessarily increase in a commensurate way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She is survived by a son.

<HEADLINE> Officer Honored in China Spy Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An intelligence officer who raised concerns in  
1995 about China's alleged theft of nuclear secrets and contends 
now he was thwarted by superiors received a special award Friday 
from Energy Secretary Bill Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson, in a brief ceremony, described the official, Notra  
Trulock, as ``a man who was persistent and most importantly 
contributed to the national security of this country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The award for ``a special act of service'' included a check for  
$10,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Trulock, deputy director of the Energy Department's Office of  
Intelligence, had praise for Richardson. ``His leadership and 
courage really did turn this thing around for us and got us onto 
the path we're on today,'' said Trulock. 
</P>
<P>
	Trulock last week told a Senate hearing that for much of 1997 he  
had been thwarted by senior Energy Department officials in trying 
to press his case for tougher security at nuclear weapons labs. He 
also said he had been blocked from testifying before Congress on 
his analysis on Chinese espionage at the labs. 
</P>
<P>
	He testified that as recently as late 1998 some administration  
officials continued to ``discredit'' his analysis that China had 
obtained significant nuclear secrets from the weapons labs. 
</P>
<P>
	``These officials sought to discredit the analysis ... as  
pessimistic,'' said Trulock, adding that be believed some of the 
critics ``had been motivated by a desire to limit the political 
damage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson took over as energy secretary in September of 1998.

<HEADLINE>  India: Pakistan Shot Down Copter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DRAS, India (AP) -- India accused Pakistan of shooting down a  
helicopter gunship today over the disputed Kashmir territory, where 
India has launched airstrikes to dislodge Islamic militants 
hunkered down in the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	India's air force said Pakistan downed the MI-17 helicopter over  
the Himalayan region claimed by the world's two newest nuclear 
powers. A spokesman said the helicopter was shot from across the 
U.N.-established demarcation line dividing the Pakistani and 
Indian-controlled zones of the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan denied shooting down the craft. ``So far we have no  
information to suggest that we fired upon an Indian helicopter,'' 
said army spokesman Brig. Rashid Quereshi. ``There is a possibility 
that their own troops shot it down accidentally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Syed Salahuddin, chairman of the United Jehad Council, a  
Kashmiri militant organization, said his group shot down the 
aircraft. The council is an umbrella group claiming to represent 14 
different Islamic secessionist groups operating in Indian-ruled 
Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said the pilot ejected as the helicopter spun several  
times after being hit, then crashed to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear whether India was accusing  
Pakistani regular forces with the attack or alleged separatist 
rebels it says are supported by Islamabad. 
</P>
<P>
	The helicopter's downing came despite a generally quiet morning  
in the skies over the frontier area. For two days, India has 
launched relentless airstrikes aimed at forcing alleged 
Pakistani-backed guerrillas from the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	India also demanded the return of pilots whose MiG fighter jets  
were downed on Thursday. Pakistan, which claims to have shot down 
both the jets, said one pilot was killed in the crash and that it 
was holding the other as a prisoner of war. 
</P>
<P>
	India's military said one MiG-21 was flying over India when it  
crashed due to mechanical failure. The second plane, a MiG-27, flew 
in to assist the first pilot and was shot down by a surface-to-air 
missile. 
</P>
<P>
	Journalists, escorted by Pakistani army officials, saw the  
wreckage of one of the downed MiGs -- including its tail emblazoned 
with the Indian flag -- strewn over a mountain ridge about seven 
miles inside Pakistani territory. 
</P>
<P>
	Army spokesman Maj. Gen. J.J. Singh said 12 soldiers are also  
missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Kashmir has been at the center of two of the three wars that  
India and Pakistan have fought since their independence in 1947. 
After both countries tested nuclear weapons last year, world 
leaders feared an arms race between the South Asian rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States, Britain, Russia, Japan, China and U.N. chief  
Kofi Annan urged restraint by both nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan pushed hard today for international intervention in the  
conflict, and a government minister said ``two nuclear-armed 
adversaries are facing each other eyeball to eyeball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We hope India will not go beyond a point of no return,'' said  
Information Minister Mushahid Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we didn't have the bomb, India would have occupied Kashmir  
by now,'' he said. ``That's what the bomb means: deterrence for 
security, for survival, for self-defense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee was to meet today  
with India's major political parties to seek endorsement for the 
military action. He met the day before with Cabinet ministers and 
military chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Foreign Ministry placed blame for the hostilities on  
Islamabad. ``The present situation has been created entirely 
because of Pakistan's provocative activities,'' it said in a 
statement Thursday. ``Pakistan should realize that such foolhardy 
ventures against India will not succeed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	India's National Security Adviser Brajesh Mishra tempered the  
Foreign Office's strong remarks, saying in a television interview 
that ``we don't think the situation will escalate into a general 
war.'' 
</P>
<P>
	India launched Operation Vijay, or Operation Victory, to evict  
about 600 guerrillas who seized unoccupied areas in the Indian-held 
part of Kashmir early this month. India says the infiltrators are 
Afghan guerrillas and Pakistani soldiers dressed like Islamic 
militants. Islamabad says it does not know the identity of the 
intruders. 
</P>
<P>
	India says the strikes have all been conducted within its  
territory, 1 1/2 miles from the demarcation line, the unofficial 
border through Kashmir both nations agreed to after the last war. 
</P>
<P>
	The private STAR TV channel reported earlier today that the  
Indian air force had deployed its top fighter jet, the Russian-made 
Sukhoi, in Kashmir to beef up its firepower. 
</P>
<P>
	The Indian government, however, denied the report. Pakistan  
denounced the alleged deployment of the Su-30s as an escalation of 
hostilities. 
</P>
<P>
	India and Pakistan went to war immediately after independence  
over Kashmir. India now controls two-thirds of Kashmir, Pakistan 
holds nearly one-third, and China has a tiny portion. India and 
Pakistan each claim Kashmir in its entirety. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian and Pakistani soldiers exchange fire along their disputed  
frontier almost every day. Indian soldiers also frequently open 
fire to thwart Pakistan-based guerrillas trying to cross into 
Indian-held areas to fight for independence for Kashmir.

<HEADLINE> Just Where IS Silicon Valley? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- There's no road sign reading ``Welcome  
to Silicon Valley.'' No arch spans the highway leading into the 
region. Even those Internet map systems can't locate it exactly. 
</P>
<P>
	While everybody knows pretty much what you mean when you mention  
the high-tech region south of San Francisco, it's driving 
cartographers nuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Compass Maps, a Modesto, Calif., company, is taking a shot at  
drawing a line around the region, and plans to release a new map as 
early as next year. 
</P>
<P>
	But it has been a struggle.  
</P>
<P>
	Does Silicon Valley include Menlo Park? Or Santa Cruz? Or the  
Sunol Grade? What about Union City or Milpitas or Morgan Hill? 
</P>
<P>
	The company's current Silicon Valley map, introduced in 1993, is  
still available. Unfortunately, in a region that shifts like the 
desert sands, it's sadly out of date. 
</P>
<P>
	Compass is talking with city and county planners about new  
streets, and also with business groups, chambers of commerce and 
other agencies with a stake in what makes up Silicon Valley.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Readies for New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hold on to your hats, New Yorkers! If  
Hillary Rodham Clinton enters the Senate race, it could be the 
state's wildest ever -- a sitting first lady pitted against New York 
City's mayor in a campaign that one political veteran predicts 
would be ``the all-time meanest, nastiest race ever in New York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What started as a lark several months ago for Mrs. Clinton has  
taken wing as an almost-ready-for-prime-time campaign for the 
Senate seat being vacated next year by Democrat Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	She already has called 200 New York politicians for  
heart-to-hearts, is learning the difference between Owego and 
Oswego, has had New York luminaries for sleepovers in the Lincoln 
Bedroom and apparently wants to spend her summer vacation in the 
wilds of the Adirondacks or the windswept vistas of eastern Long 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton has gone so far as to ask state Democratic  
Chairwoman Judith Hope to scout out living rooms in rural upstate 
New York where the folks might want to share coffee and cookies 
with a first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	President and Mrs. Clinton are vacationing in Florida over the  
Memorial Day weekend. When they return, top advisers say, she will 
either announce she is not running or press ahead, forming an 
exploratory committee in late June or early July and kicking off a 
full-fledged candidacy sometime in the fall or later. 
</P>
<P>
	Hope and other advisers expect the Yale Law School-educated  
woman -- who has never worked, lived or studied in New York -- to 
enter the race, which could pit her against the quintessential New 
Yorker -- New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	His fans, and enemies, say he is as tough as they come -- a  
former federal prosecutor not known for his social skills. 
</P>
<P>
	``Giuliani, because of his nature, will throw every vile charge  
he can dream up at her,'' said former New York City Mayor Edward 
Koch, a Democrat. ``I think she can beat him, but it will be a very 
tough race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other prominent New York Democrats agree with Koch.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think Rudy and company will fight a pretty nasty battle,''  
said former New York City Mayor David Dinkins, who beat Giuliani in 
1989 only to lose to him in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could be the all-time meanest, nastiest race ever in New  
York,'' state Comptroller H. Carl McCall said. 
</P>
<P>
	New York's last Senate race, in 1998, was called one of the  
ugliest the state has seen, marked by negative advertising and 
name-callling. The Republican incument, Alfonse D'Amato, called his 
Democratic opponent, Charles Schumer a ``putzhead.'' Schumer, who 
repeatedly challenged D'Amato's ethics, won that contest. 
</P>
<P>
	Should Mrs. Clinton run, New York's political pros say she will  
not only face a brutal campaign, but could wind up hurting 
Democrats elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	And, on the Republican side, one veteran GOP operative thinks  
the price of beating her may be so high as to leave any GOP winner 
with a ``Pyrrhic victory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She's going to take advantage of how she's perceived right  
now, which is as first lady, mother, wronged wife, feminist 
champion, humanitarian, martyr. She's going to run as St. Joan of 
Arc ... Eleanor Roosevelt reincarnated,'' GOP consultant Jay 
Severin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sobering news for Republicans is that anybody who plans to  
beat her is going to have to knock her off every one of those 
pedestals ... and the cost of doing that is very high,'' the 
Republican strategist added. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to being attacked as a carpetbagger, Mrs. Clinton  
will face questions again over Whitewater, Travelgate, her good 
fortune investing in cattle futures, the billing practices of her 
old law firm and her husband's infidelity. 
</P>
<P>
	She got a taste of that Wednesday when CBS' Dan Rather asked her  
what she would answer when asked: ``Why are you still with this 
man?'' 
</P>
<P>
	She noted they had been married for almost 24 years.

<HEADLINE> Jailed Teen Says Cop Fathered Baby </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OCALA, Fla. (AP) -- A 17-year-old mother was jailed for eight  
hours until she identified the father of her baby. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl had been called into court to answer questions about a  
police officer charged with having sex with her while she was 
underage. 
</P>
<P>
	At first, she told the judge it was none of his business who  
fathered her 5-month-old daughter. Circuit Judge Carven Angel found 
her in contempt of court Wednesday and ordered her jailed for 179 
days or until she answered whether 36-year-old Cpl. Salvador 
Armando Garcia was the father. 
</P>
<P>
	She finally identified Garcia as the father. She said she  
relented because prosecutors had implied she could lose custody of 
her child. 
</P>
<P>
	The girl said that her relationship with Garcia was consensual  
and that she led him to believe she was 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Garcia's lawyer had no comment.

<HEADLINE> Hillary Readies for New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Hold on to your hats, New Yorkers! If  
Hillary Rodham Clinton enters the Senate race, it could be the 
state's wildest ever -- a sitting first lady pitted against New York 
City's mayor in a campaign that one political veteran predicts 
would be ``the all-time meanest, nastiest race ever in New York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What started as a lark several months ago for Mrs. Clinton has  
taken wing as an almost-ready-for-prime-time campaign for the 
Senate seat being vacated next year by Democrat Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	She already has called 200 New York politicians for  
heart-to-hearts, is learning the difference between Owego and 
Oswego, has had New York luminaries for sleepovers in the Lincoln 
Bedroom and apparently wants to spend her summer vacation in the 
wilds of the Adirondacks or the windswept vistas of eastern Long 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton has gone so far as to ask state Democratic  
Chairwoman Judith Hope to scout out living rooms in rural upstate 
New York where the folks might want to share coffee and cookies 
with a first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	President and Mrs. Clinton are vacationing in Florida over the  
Memorial Day weekend. When they return, top advisers say, she will 
either announce she is not running or press ahead, forming an 
exploratory committee in late June or early July and kicking off a 
full-fledged candidacy sometime in the fall or later. 
</P>
<P>
	Hope and other advisers expect the Yale Law School-educated  
woman -- who has never worked, lived or studied in New York -- to 
enter the race, which could pit her against the quintessential New 
Yorker -- New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	His fans, and enemies, say he is as tough as they come -- a  
former federal prosecutor not known for his social skills. 
</P>
<P>
	``Giuliani, because of his nature, will throw every vile charge  
he can dream up at her,'' said former New York City Mayor Edward 
Koch, a Democrat. ``I think she can beat him, but it will be a very 
tough race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other prominent New York Democrats agree with Koch.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think Rudy and company will fight a pretty nasty battle,''  
said former New York City Mayor David Dinkins, who beat Giuliani in 
1989 only to lose to him in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could be the all-time meanest, nastiest race ever in New  
York,'' state Comptroller H. Carl McCall said. 
</P>
<P>
	New York's last Senate race, in 1998, was called one of the  
ugliest the state has seen, marked by negative advertising and 
name-callling. The Republican incument, Alfonse D'Amato, called his 
Democratic opponent, Charles Schumer a ``putzhead.'' Schumer, who 
repeatedly challenged D'Amato's ethics, won that contest. 
</P>
<P>
	Should Mrs. Clinton run, New York's political pros say she will  
not only face a brutal campaign, but could wind up hurting 
Democrats elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	And, on the Republican side, one veteran GOP operative thinks  
the price of beating her may be so high as to leave any GOP winner 
with a ``Pyrrhic victory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She's going to take advantage of how she's perceived right  
now, which is as first lady, mother, wronged wife, feminist 
champion, humanitarian, martyr. She's going to run as St. Joan of 
Arc ... Eleanor Roosevelt reincarnated,'' GOP consultant Jay 
Severin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sobering news for Republicans is that anybody who plans to  
beat her is going to have to knock her off every one of those 
pedestals ... and the cost of doing that is very high,'' the 
Republican strategist added. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to being attacked as a carpetbagger, Mrs. Clinton  
will face questions again over Whitewater, Travelgate, her good 
fortune investing in cattle futures, the billing practices of her 
old law firm and her husband's infidelity. 
</P>
<P>
	She got a taste of that Wednesday when CBS' Dan Rather asked her  
what she would answer when asked: ``Why are you still with this 
man?'' 
</P>
<P>
	She noted they had been married for almost 24 years.  
</P>
<P>
	There is also talk among some party stalwarts that by running a  
high-profile and expensive race in heavily Democratic New York, 
Mrs. Clinton could damage Vice President Al Gore's chances of 
moving up to the White House and even the party's chances of taking 
back Congress. She is considered one of the party's most effective 
campaigners. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Funds Have a Lot To Boast About </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There is a simple reason why so many people have  
picked stock mutual funds for the job of managing their money: The 
funds have an impressive resume. 
</P>
<P>
	We're not talking here about a flash-in-the-pan showing over the  
last quarter by some individual fund riding a hot streak. Things 
like that happen all the time without proving much. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, we're looking at the record achieved by growth stock  
funds as a group over a truly long-term stretch -- the past 35 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	From the start of 1964 through the end of 1998, reports the  
research firm of Wiesenberger in Rockville, Md., the Wiesenberger 
Growth Mutual Fund Index posted an average annual return of 12.97 
percent, doubling investors' money every five and a half years or 
so. 
</P>
<P>
	Over that span of almost two generations, the growth fund index  
bested both the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock composite index, which 
averaged a 12.21 percent annual gain, and the Dow Jones industrial 
average, which averaged an 11.70 percent annual gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Growth funds also outperformed single-family houses, Treasury  
bonds and bills, gold and silver, farmland, the Swiss franc and 
U.S. savings bonds. They trounced inflation, which averaged 4.88 
percent a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The average growth mutual fund outperformed all alternative  
investments reviewed over the past 35 years,'' points out David 
Chase in the just-published 1999 edition of Wiesenberger's 
Investment Performance Digest. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the mighty bull market on Wall Street had a lot to do  
with the growth funds' outstanding showing. Even the most ardent 
fan of the funds would acknowledge that 13 percent a year for 35 
years is a lot to expect from any investment, and the future 
probably won't be so bounteous. 
</P>
<P>
	But the last 35 years weren't just a one-way ride on the success  
express. Bear markets, some of them quite severe, struck stocks in 
1969-70, 1973-74, 1981-82 and 1990. Then there was the Crash of 
1987, which compressed a bear market-sized decline of more than 30 
percent into three months. 
</P>
<P>
	If you bought stock mutual funds in the 1960s, you had to ride  
out a very disappointing decade in the 1970s, when it looked as 
though chronic inflation was wrecking the stock market. Then, in 
the '80s and '90s, you had to resist the ever-present temptation to 
cash out your gains, amid constant cries that stocks had climbed to 
unsustainable heights. 
</P>
<P>
	In truth, very few people owned stock funds all through the last  
35 years. In the early '60s, there was only about $20 billion 
invested in all types of mutual funds, compared with more than $5.5 
trillion today. 
</P>
<P>
	Even among those investors who were aboard in the early years,  
many didn't stay. According to Investment Company Institute 
figures, the number of shareholder accounts in long-term funds 
shrank by more than 3 million in the lean years, from 10.33 million 
in 1973 to 7.17 million in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	In any case, something like three-quarters, conservatively  
estimated, of all of today's fund accounts weren't opened until the 
'90s. 
</P>
<P>
	Skeptics on the funds, and there are still many of them, seize  
on these numbers to say that the funds' record is largely illusory. 
The spectacular gain of the past 35 years, they say, was achieved 
starting from a low base, with only a handful of funds owning a 
small piece of the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	As more and more people got into the game, the funds' task got  
harder. If in the beginning the funds enjoyed all the speed and 
maneuverability of a sports car, today they more closely resemble a 
bus -- and a heavily loaded bus at that. 
</P>
<P>
	Points taken. But commentators have been describing the  
theoretical limitations of funds ever since the 1960s. And through 
the past 35 years, the average stock fund, by Wiesenberger's 
reckoning, has somehow contrived to outdistance the Dow, outstrip 
the S&AMP;P 500, and achieve an outstanding investment return. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a debatable question whether stock funds will beat the  
averages and provide a good payoff in the future. But if the issue 
is whether they CAN do these things, well, the record of the last 
three and a half decades is there to speak for itself.

<HEADLINE> Sinatra Kidnapper Appeal Shot Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A man who kidnapped Frank Sinatra's son in  
1963 cannot make any money from a movie about the crime, a state 
appeals court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 3-0 ruling, the 2nd District Court of Appeal on Thursday  
rejected Barry Keenan's challenge to a 1986 California law that 
requires convicted felons to pay their victims when they sell their 
stories. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling was issued only a day after the case was argued.  
</P>
<P>
	Frank Sinatra Jr.'s lawyer, Richard Specter, said he was  
gratified by the speed and unanimity of the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``It demonstrates that the Legislature knew what it was doing,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Keenan was the leader of three kidnappers who abducted a  
19-year-old Sinatra from Harrah's Casino at Lake Tahoe in 1963. He 
was released unharmed after a ransom payment. All three kidnappers 
were caught and convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	Keenan, who blamed his actions on drugs and alcohol, spent less  
than five years in prison and now is a land developer in 
Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
	After a magazine interview with Keenan was published last year,  
he and the writer sold the movie rights to Columbia Pictures. But 
Sinatra sued the kidnappers, the writer and Columbia and got a 
court order preventing the studio from paying Keenan. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ruling bars the studio from paying Keenan and requires  
it to set any payments aside for his victim. The court rejected 
Keenan's argument that the law violates free speech by suppressing 
criminals' accounts of their past. 
</P>
<P>
	Keenan's lawyer, Stephen Rohde, was not available for comment.

<HEADLINE> PG&AMP;E Eettles Pacific Blackout Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric Co. will pay  
$440,000 to operators of an electric grid system to settle charges 
connected with the massive power failure that blacked out San 
Francisco December 8. 
</P>
<P>
	The quasi-public state Independent System Operator's board  
approved the settlement on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The money will go to ISO's operating budget and will help fund  
studies to devise improvements to the high-voltage system serving 
San Francisco, the Peninsula and San Diego, areas with transmission 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	As an interim measure, PG&AMP;E has agreed to make improvements in  
employee training, equipment maintenance and operating procedures 
suggested by the ISO. 
</P>
<P>
	The $440,000 fine is the most the year-old ISO was authorized to  
fine the utility. It soon will ask the Federal Energy Regulatory 
Commission for greater fining authority. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Public Utilities Commission also has investigated the  
blackout and issued its own report, although it has so far not 
sought to levy any penalty against PG&AMP;E.

<HEADLINE> ''Topkapi'' Dagger on Display in DC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Actor Peter Ustinov won an Oscar for his  
performance, but a centuries-old, jeweled dagger was the real star 
of the movie ``Topkapi'' 35 years ago -- and will be the centerpiece 
of a Turkish art show visiting the United States next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Clothes and jewelry will join paintings, rare carpets and other  
works of art from Topkapi Palace, once the center of the 700-year 
Ottoman empire and now a major tourist attraction in Istanbul. 
</P>
<P>
	The exhibit, called ``Palace of Gold and Light,'' will open in  
the Corcoran Gallery of Art, Washington's oldest art museum, on 
March 1, 2000. Then it goes on to the San Diego Museum of Art and 
the Museum of Art in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., where it will stay 
until Jan. 14, 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many of the objects have never left Turkey,'' said Richard C.  
Barkley, former U.S. ambassador to Ankara, announcing the show 
Thursday at the Turkish Embassy in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	The dagger itself has previously made a brief trip to this  
country. 
</P>
<P>
	Some film lovers still remember the look in Melina Mercouri's  
eyes as she gazed at the giant emeralds in the dagger's handle. 
There's also an eight-sided emerald cover at the top that conceals 
a small watch, and there are two rows of diamonds on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
	It was made as a fitting gift for the Persian King Nadir Shah,  
who had a taste for jewels. He invaded India, sacked Delhi and 
returned with the Peacock Throne and the Koh-i-Noor diamond. But 
assassins got him before the dagger could be presented in 1747. 
Half a century of civil war followed in what is now Iran. 
</P>
<P>
	In the film the dagger was the object of thrilling but  
ultimately failed burglary.

<HEADLINE> Small Businesses Push Tax Cut Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Greater deductions for health insurance and  
business meals highlight a five-year, $30 billion Republican tax 
relief package aimed at small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Jim Talent, R-Mo., chairman of the House Small Business  
Committee, said supporters will seek to include the package in the 
larger 10-year, $778 billion tax cut Republicans intend to put 
together this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is one-fifth of the tax cut in the budget,'' Talent told  
reporters Thursday. ``We don't think that's asking too much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would make health insurance costs fully deductible  
for the self-employed next year, instead of 2003 as envisioned in 
current law. It would also increase the meal tax deduction from 50 
percent to 80 percent by 2008, but only for smaller businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The most costly item, at $15 billion over five years, would  
lower from 39.6 percent to 34 percent the top individual income tax 
rate for partnerships, including closely held ones known as 
Subchapter S corporations, and certain other small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would also eliminate a surtax included in employee  
payroll taxes in 1976 to help the government pay back loans for its 
unemployment accounts. Even though the loans were repaid in 1987, 
the surtax remains in place. 
</P>
<P>
	A small business is defined by number of employees -- generally  
fewer than 50 -- and not by revenues. Some small businesses have 
multimillion-dollar annual revenues. 
</P>
<P>
	Small businesses, an important constituency for the GOP, employ  
six of 10 American workers, according to the U.S. Chamber of 
Commerce. An estimated 16 million businesses employ 20 or fewer 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to do everything we can to help small businesses get  
started and prosper, and get the federal government out of their 
way,'' said Rep. Jim DeMint, R-S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other priorities for small business, reducing capital-gains  
taxes and abolishing estate taxes, were not included in the bill 
but have other champions in Congress who are pushing their cause. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Ways and Means Committee tentatively is scheduled to  
hold hearings on tax relief proposals the third week of June, an 
aide said Thursday, with legislation expected to begin moving in 
mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans believe that President Clinton would veto a massive  
tax cut but that compromise is possible later this year on a 
smaller measure that could include some of the small-business 
provisions. White House aides say Clinton could support modest cuts 
that mainly benefit the middle class.

<HEADLINE> United Customer Service OKs Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- United Airlines' 19,000 newly organized customer  
service employees have overwhelmingly ratified a contract that 
provides pay raises and signing bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
	About 70 percent of those voting during the past few weeks  
approved the one-year pact the airline negotiated with the 
International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, 
United spokesman Joe Hopkins said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement, which was reached last month, covers ticket  
counter workers, reservationists, air freight agents and others. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pleased that this contract has been ratified,'' United  
chairman and CEO Gerald Greenwald said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the agreement, the airline will eliminate one of its lower  
wage tiers. That will mean an immediate 14.5 percent pay increase 
for nearly half of the 19,000 workers. Other workers will get a 
$750 bonus when the contract is signed. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the workers will get a 5.5 percent pay increase next  
April 13. 
</P>
<P>
	The passenger service employees voted last July to join the  
machinists union, which also represents United's mechanics and ramp 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
	A machinists union official did not immediately return a  
telephone message Friday seeking comment.

<HEADLINE> 'Phantom Menace' Opens in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- It took a bunch of American kids to bring  
``Star Wars'' fever to Singapore on Friday, where the long-awaited 
prequel opened for the first time outside the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Eight boys from the Singapore American School spent the day  
making long black and brown capes and assembling light sabers out 
of metal poles and electrical tape. 
</P>
<P>
	``We sewed these costumes while we watched all the other (`Star  
Wars') movies,'' said Paul du Pont, 15, of Midland, Mich. He and 
his brothers and friends saved their money to buy $60 tickets for 
the charity premiere of ``Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom 
Menace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They staged mock light saber battles on the street outside the  
cinema. Once the movie began, ``We started the cheers when 
`LucasFilm' flashed on the screen,'' said Nathan Chin, 13, of 
Fairfax, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	The audience also cheered at the appearance of old favorites,  
such as R2-D2 and Jabba the Hutt. A new character, 
computer-animated Jar Binks, ``is not as annoying as everyone says. 
He helps balance the movie,'' said Evan Schwamb, 16, of 
Indianapolis, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the hype that Singapore -- a techno savvy, rich and  
modern city-state -- would be the first in the world outside the 
United States to legally see what has been touted as the most 
anticipated movie of all time, most Singaporeans were blase about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two fans waited all night to be the first to buy the  
charity tickets, and some seats in the first row went unsold.

<HEADLINE> Shuttle Prepares for Station Linkup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) -- Discovery's astronauts geared up  
for the first orbital linkup with the new international space 
station, examining equipment and testing suits to be used during a 
weekend spacewalk. 
</P>
<P>
	The seven-member crew will be the second to visit the fledgling  
station but the first to dock with it. The spacecraft are scheduled 
to rendezvous about 12:30 a.m. EDT Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Following a picture-perfect launch Thursday morning, Discovery  
trailed the outpost by about 430 miles this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	The crew of five Americans, one Russian and one Canadian is  
delivering 2 tons of spare parts, clothes and other supplies for 
future station residents, and fixing broken or noisy equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	After the two spacecraft are linked, astronauts Tamara Jernigan  
and Daniel Barry will venture out on a six-hour spacewalk late 
Saturday night to attach tool bags and cranes to the outside of the 
station. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry likened the astronauts' duties to those of a moving crew.  
</P>
<P>
	``We have a new house, and it doesn't have much furniture or  
trim just yet,'' he said prior to liftoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The astronauts, working the graveyard shift during their 10-day  
mission, were awakened for their first full day of duties Thursday 
evening and quickly got to work today preparing for the docking and 
spacewalk. 
</P>
<P>
	Jernigan, Barry, backup spacewalker Rick Husband and Canadian  
astronaut Julie Payette powered up the suits to be used during the 
spacewalk, testing the communications systems to ensure everything 
was in working order. 
</P>
<P>
	Payette and astronaut Ellen Ochoa also tested the shuttle's  
mechanical arm, on which Jernigan will be positioned during the 
spacewalk. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the crew, including commander Kent Rominger, spent  
the day examining docking equipment such as a laptop computer 
Rominger will use to help navigate as he links Discovery with the 
space station. 
</P>
<P>
	All the equipment passed muster.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a pleasure watching your flawless work to this  
point,'' Mission Control told the crew. 
</P>
<P>
	The spacecraft will be joined for six days. Discovery is due  
back on Earth June 6. 
</P>
<P>
	The 16-nation space station was last visited in December, when  
astronauts delivered the American-made Unity chamber and connected 
it with the Russian-built Zarya control module, which was already 
in orbit. 
</P>
<P>
	The 77-foot, 70,000-pound station has since been circling the  
Earth under the watch of flight controllers in Houston and Moscow. 
Space officials could hardly wait to get another close-up look. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is an excellent chance to go back up and see the hardware,  
see how it's been performing, work on a few components that need a 
little bit of attention and, of course, begin to transfer a large 
amount of hardware into the station that the crew will use in the 
future for living and working up there,'' said Frank Culbertson, 
deputy program manager for space station operations.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Hurts Clinton's Poll Ratings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Neither Monica Lewinsky nor impeachment put a  
dent in President Clinton's lofty poll ratings. It took a war. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's approval ratings are dropping as Americans grow  
increasingly anxious about nine weeks of airstrikes, bombing 
accidents and debates over a ground invasion. 
</P>
<P>
	The president is still in relatively good shape with more than  
half the country -- 53 percent in the latest survey-- approving of 
how he handles his job. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fifty-three percent midway through your seventh year is pretty  
darn good,'' said Brookings Institution analyst Stephen Hess, an 
adviser to the Carter, Ford, Nixon and Eisenhower administrations. 
``It's always, compared to what and compared to whom? He was on 
such an abnormal high, thanks to impeachment. Now he's about where 
presidents tend to be at this point. That's not bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the polls reveal doubts among Americans -- and those concerns  
have been reflected on Capitol Hill, most notably when the House, 
on a tie vote of 213 to 213, refused to support airstrikes against 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of these polls are showing less basic support for  
involvement in Kosovo and less general support for President 
Clinton as a consequence,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew 
Research Center. ``The public is frustrated by a lack of progress 
and also by these accidents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``President Clinton should be somewhat nervous and Al Gore  
should be very nervous,'' Kohut said. ``A decline in basic 
political support would not be a good thing for campaign 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials said they are not alarmed by the declining  
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Historically, it's high,'' said presidential press secretary  
Joe Lockhart. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is some natural impatience with some who would like to  
see this over with,'' Lockhart said. He said the administration 
shares that feeling, ``but we have to show determination and 
patience until we have met our objectives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A series of recent news stories -- the Colorado shootings, China  
and Kosovo -- ``have dampened the national mood a little bit,'' 
Lockhart said. ``But we're working hard on all fronts and we're 
confident the president will continue to enjoy strong support from 
the American public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton pollster Mark Penn takes regular surveys about the  
Kosovo conflict -- weekly, according to one senior administration 
official, less frequently, according to another. 
</P>
<P>
	A Pew poll conducted May 12-16 found that public approval for  
U.S. participation in the airstrikes had fallen to 53 percent from 
62 percent in mid-April. Clinton's foreign policy ratings slipped 
and his overall job approval was unchanged at 56 percent after 
slipping a few weeks earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, down from the halcyon days of impeachment,'' Kohut  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A poll released Wednesday by CNN/USA Today/Gallup was similar to  
the Pew survey: Clinton's job approval declined to 53 percent, from 
60 percent earlier this month, support for U.S. involvement in 
Kosovo slipped to 49 percent and only 40 percent of Americans 
supported sending ground troops if airstrikes didn't work. Pew 
found 44 percent would support sending ground troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``My sense is that he can do anything except get Americans  
killed,'' said Hess. ``A ground war is out. As far as continuing 
his present policy, I think Americans are willing to go along with 
him, sometimes holding their nose, but to go along with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kohut said Clinton would need ``not only a majority but a big  
majority'' of support before moving to a ground invasion. ``They're 
nowhere close to it. They've never had it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hess said public attention to the war is falling off as  
television news about Kosovo declines. ``At the beginning of April 
we were getting something like 215 minutes on the weekday news 
programs. Last week it was down to 55 minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was telling that Clinton felt comfortable taking a  
Florida vacation during the airstrikes. ``That's indicative of how 
this war isn't sticking to the ribs of the average American.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 

</P>
<P>
	EDITOR'S NOTE -- The most recent Pew poll at a margin of error of  
3.5 percentage points; the margin of error for the most recent 
CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll was 3 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Cleveland Voucher Plan Struck Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- In a partial victory for the state's  
teachers' unions, the Ohio Supreme Court has struck down 
Cleveland's school voucher program because of a technicality in the 
way the program was written into law. 
</P>
<P>
	But the ruling Thursday also gave backers of school vouchers  
cause for hope -- the court said the program does not breach the 
separation of church and state, as union leaders had argued. 
</P>
<P>
	``We'll take any victory the court will give us,'' said Michael  
Billirakis, president of the 108,000-member Ohio Education 
Association, which was joined by the Ohio Federation of Teachers in 
opposing the voucher program. 
</P>
<P>
	The program provides tax-funded scholarships to poor students in  
Cleveland so they can attend private schools, including religious 
schools. This year, it provided aid to about 4,000 children. 
</P>
<P>
	In striking down the program, the high court said its creation  
in 1995 violated the Ohio Constitution's ``single-subject rule,'' 
which requires the Legislature to address only one issue in each 
bill. The legislation establishing the voucher program was included 
in the state's 1995 general spending bill. 
</P>
<P>
	That budget bill contained 383 amendments, and the court has  
allowed various subjects to be combined in a single bill for 
``practical, rational or legitimate reasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a program that could prove contentious or raise  
constitutional questions needed to be the subject of a separate 
bill, the court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ruled that for the most part, the program doesn't  
violate the separation of church and state. 
</P>
<P>
	``We conclude that the school voucher program has a secular  
legislative purpose, does not have the primary effect of advancing 
religion, and does not excessively entangle government with 
religion,'' Justice Paul Pfeifer wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Bob Taft said he would support reinstating the program --  
which would involve having lawmakers rewrite the legislation to 
abide by the court's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have supported the Cleveland scholarship program as a pilot  
project and do not believe it should be terminated due to a 
procedural flaw in legislation,'' Taft said in a prepared release. 
</P>
<P>
	But Billirakis, who argues that the voucher program siphons  
money from public schools, said the unions would fight any attempt 
to revive the program in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they come back with separate piece of legislation, we will  
hold them accountable. It's something we will vehemently oppose 
legally, legislatively, anyway we can,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Jo Ann Davidson said Davidson, R-Reynoldsburg,  
said the Legislature would have to act soon if it chooses to set up 
another program. Lawmakers want to recess in July after finishing 
work on the $39.55 billion budget. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers created the voucher program amid public concern about  
Cleveland public schools' high dropout rates and low student test 
scores. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, Florida became the nation's only statewide program to  
let students attend private schools at taxpayer expense. Vermont 
has allowed tax dollars to be spent for private school tuition in 
rural areas for more than a century, while Maine has a similar 
program. Milwaukee also has started a voucher program.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Medal of Honor Winners Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Nearly 100 Medal of Honor winners gathered  
on Friday for the unveiling of the first monument recognizing the 
more than 3,400 recipients of America's highest distinction for 
military valor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Medal of Honor Memorial consists of 27 bluish-green, curved  
glass panels that rise above the canal that splits downtown 
Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	The veterans got their first chance Friday to walk among those  
walls, during a dedication ceremony at which speaker after speaker 
called the former servicemen the greatest heroes of the 20th 
century. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wear these medals, not for ourselves, but for those who  
served with us and whose work went unseen,'' said Paul Bucha, who 
earned the medal while serving in the Army in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	As Bucha finished, a curtain of American flags parted so  
hundreds of onlookers who crammed the canal's banks could see the 
memorial. Moments later, they crossed the canal to visit the 
monument and medal-bearers. 
</P>
<P>
	Loved ones scoured the panels for veteran's name. Cries of  
``Here, you are!'' echoed. ``It's just awesome,'' said Rick 
Pittman, a 53-year-old Californian who earned his medal with the 
Marines in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	The panels bear the names of all Medal of Honor winners from 15  
military conflicts dating to the Civil War, with their branch of 
service and the site of their heroic deeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Every night at dusk, a sound system will play recorded stories,  
narrated by the servicemen who hold the star-shaped medallions. 
</P>
<P>
	IPALCO Enterprises Inc., a holding company for the electrical  
utility that serves Indianapolis, spent $2.5 million to build the 
memorial. It also paid to bring to Indianapolis as many of the 160 
surviving Medal of Honor recipients as possible for the dedication 
over Memorial Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just ordinary men and we were very fortunate to do deeds  
that were seen,'' said Stephen Gregg, 84, of Bayonne, N.J., who 
dodged gunfire and grenades to give cover to a medic who rescued 
seven wounded soldiers in World War II France. 
</P>
<P>
	IPALCO chairman John Hodowal got the idea for the memorial from  
these stories after learning that there was no monument to the 
heroics of those who won the Medal of Honor. 
</P>
<P>
	The honored veterans will ride in the Indianapolis 500 Festival  
Parade on Saturday and take a spin around Indianapolis Motor 
Speedway before Sunday's big race. 
</P>
<P>
	Clyde Choate, 78, of Anna, Ill., brought two grandsons to see  
the memorial. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's probably hundreds of thousands of members of the armed  
forces that did equally as much as we few have done,'' said Choate, 
an Army staff sergeant who single-handedly destroyed an enemy tank 
in France during World War II. ``But they were never recognized for 
it.''

<HEADLINE> IRA Reveals Secretly Buried Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The Irish Republican Army began  
revealing the whereabouts of nine secretly buried victims on 
Friday, a gesture designed to quell the protests of long-suffering 
relatives and build good will at a critical moment in peacemaking. 
</P>
<P>
	At dawn in a medieval graveyard on the Irish Republic's border  
with Northern Ireland, police found what they thought were the 
remains of Eamon Molloy -- a Belfast IRA member who disappeared in 
1975 after being branded an informer. 
</P>
<P>
	The remains, evidently dug up from their original resting place,  
were left in a new casket lying behind shrubs amid the 
lichen-covered headstones. 
</P>
<P>
	Irish police also began searching other remote border locations  
after a victims' remains commission, formally established Friday by 
the British and Irish governments, confirmed it had received 
precise information from the IRA via Catholic priests and other 
intermediaries. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRA has promised to reveal the resting places of nine people  
the outlawed organization killed between 1972 and 1981, all 
Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
	A group of relatives, Families for the Disappeared, have  
demanded this since the IRA called its first lengthy cease-fire in 
1994. The IRA's current truce has lasted 22 months. 
</P>
<P>
	``This day is far, far too long in coming. You feel like you can  
finally start to grieve,'' said Helen McKendry, whose mother Jean -- 
the widowed parent of 10 children -- was abducted by the IRA from 
their Belfast home in 1972 and killed. Her children, who initially 
thought their mother had abandoned them, ended up in separate 
foster homes. 
</P>
<P>
	But McKendry and her husband, Seamus, waited in vain Friday for  
a phone call from the police. Seamus McKendry founded Families of 
the Disappeared on behalf of 19 families who believe the IRA killed 
their vanished relatives. The IRA denies responsibility for the 10 
other people. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the British and Irish parliaments passed laws  
ensuring that no evidence connected with the graves could be used 
to convict IRA members. 
</P>
<P>
	A Catholic priest counseling the Molloy family, the Rev. Patrick  
McCafferty, said few of the families of the missing were angered by 
this amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those who killed these nine people may have escaped justice in  
this world, but they will come to meet their maker,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRA has moved on this long-simmering issue at a time when  
the British and Irish governments and the Ulster Unionists, 
Northern Ireland's major pro-British Protestant party, have been 
demanding that the IRA start to disarm in support of the 1998 peace 
accord. 
</P>
<P>
	Because the IRA refuses, the Ulster Unionists are refusing to  
form a new Protestant-Catholic government that would include the 
IRA-linked Sinn Fein party. The British government has set what it 
calls an ``absolute deadline'' of June 30 for local politicians to 
form the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams emphasized Friday that he  
considered the IRA's initiative a matter of ``correcting a human 
rights wrong,'' and hoped it showed people that the entire Sinn 
Fein-IRA movement was committed to reconciliation.

<HEADLINE> Paul Allen Buying Another Cable Co. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Striking his second cable TV deal in two days  
and fourth in a week, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen said today 
he's buying Denver-based Fanch Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	No price was disclosed for privately held Fanch, which will put  
Allen's Charter Communications squarely in the No. 4 spot in the 
U.S. cable industry, behind AT&AMP;T, Time Warner and Comcast. 
</P>
<P>
	Fanch has about 547,000 subscribers, boosting Charter's base of  
subscribers to about 5.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Like AT&AMP;T, which in less than a year has agreed to buy two of  
nation's the four biggest cable companies, Allen is hoping to use 
cable TV wires as pipelines for super-fast Internet access, phone 
service, and digital television. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fanch deal comes a day after Charter said it was buying  
Falcon Communications of Los Angeles for $3.6 billion and just a 
week after Charter said it was buying two smaller cable operators. 
</P>
<P>
	Those deals are part of cable spending spree that began a year  
ago with Allen's $2.8 billion purchase of Marcus Cable, then the 
nation's largest privately held cable operator. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, in July, he paid $4.5 billion for Charter, which is now  
the umbrella company for his cable properties. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, St. Louis-based Charter has purchased a dozen cable  
companies over the past year, spending almost $13 billion, 
excluding the amount paid for Fanch. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the Fanch purchase weren't released, but based on the  
price of $3,600 per subscriber Charter paid for Falcon, the Fanch 
acquisition would cost Charter at least $1.9 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen, who co-founded Microsoft with Bill Gates in 1975, is the  
third wealthiest American, thanks mainly to his Microsoft shares. 
Forbes Magazine has estimated his personal wealth at $22 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen also has been amassing a portfolio of high-tech and  
entertainment companies under his holding company, Vulcan Ventures, 
in hopes of providing high-speed interactive services. 
</P>
<P>
	Vulcan's other holdings include an Internet portal site called  
Go2Net, which offers personal finance and commerce features, and 
High Speed Access Corp., a provider of Internet access over cable 
TV lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen also owns two professional sports teams -- the Seattle  
Seahawks of football and the Portland Trail Blazers of basketball -- 
which could save Charter money by eliminating the licensing fees 
that programmers usually pay to sports franchises.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Calls Caldera Claim Bogus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Neither consumers nor personal computer  
makers were hurt by Microsoft's licensing practices for the MS-DOS 
operating system in the early 1990s, a Microsoft attorney argued. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Klapper said Thursday that the contention by Caldera  
Inc. of Orem, Utah, that Microsoft deliberately used licensing to 
quash the competing DR-DOS system is bogus. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where was competition hurt here?'' he asked U.S. District  
Court Judge Dee Benson, who is hearing Caldera's antitrust case 
against the much bigger software company. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera now owns DR-DOS, an operating system that in the late  
1980s and early 1990s was gaining a toehold against MS-DOS in the 
personal computer market. An operating system controls the basic 
functions of a computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail customers could have bought DR-DOS in stores, Klapper  
said. ``It was pretty clear they didn't want DR-DOS.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And manufacturers chose one of three kinds of MS-DOS licenses  
from Microsoft rather than DR-DOS, a product of DRI and later 
Novell, he said. ``They had choices and they made them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft is asking the judge to dismiss Caldera's claim that it  
kept a stranglehold on the personal computer operating system 
market with its licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The licensing claim is one of nine aspects of Caldera's case  
that Microsoft has asked the judge to throw out. Benson is hearing 
arguments on the nine motions this week and during June. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera, financed by former Novell chairman Ray Noorda, bought  
DR-DOS from Novell in 1996 and promptly filed the antitrust 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Novell had stopped selling DR-DOS for personal computers in  
1994, but Caldera chief executive Bryan Sparks says he and Noorda 
wanted Microsoft held accountable for what they claim was 
anticompetitive behavior by a monopolist. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera claims that personal computer manufacturers -- the  
biggest customers for operating systems -- were coerced to buy only 
Microsoft's MS-DOS. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the most economical licensing arrangement, manufacturers  
had to pay Microsoft a royalty whether they loaded MS-DOS or not, 
which made purchases of DR-DOS unlikely, Caldera says. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Redmond, Wash., company also used tactics that resulted  
in manufacturers ending their MS-DOS licensing periods with large 
account balances that could only be erased by renewing the 
licenses, Caldera alleges. 
</P>
<P>
	``A customer who had any crazy ideas about going with a  
competitor knew that his account was in jeopardy,'' Caldera 
attorney Stephen Susman argued on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Few manufacturers that signed Microsoft's restrictive licenses  
ever did business with DR-DOS, Caldera says. 
</P>
<P>
	Susman told the judge that it's silly for Microsoft to claim  
consumers could have bought DR-DOS if they preferred it over MS-DOS 
since retail sales are almost all software upgrades. Since the 
computers originally came with MS-DOS, consumers were unlikely to 
upgrade with DR-DOS. 
</P>
<P>
	Klapper said the fact Microsoft offered three kinds of licenses  
indicates it was not trying to crush DR-DOS. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, more than half of the licenses required manufacturers  
to pay only for each copy of Microsoft's operating system that they 
put in PCs or a line of PCs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	DRI and Novell had frequent chances to go after manufacturing  
customers as their Microsoft licenses expired, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Klapper said Microsoft was using its licensing practices before  
and after DR-DOS was a competitive threat, but the judge was 
dubious. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that the per-processor licenses -- the ones Caldera  
claims were anticompetitive -- made up the vast majority of 
Microsoft's MS-DOS licenses in precisely the years DR-DOS was 
competing against it. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge suggested that evidence alone may be sufficient for  
him to reject Microsoft's motion to dismiss and instead allow a 
jury to hear the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury trial is scheduled for January.

<HEADLINE> Racer Stewart Going for the Double </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Imagine driving from Los Angeles to Denver  
in one day. In heavy traffic, with other drivers tailgating and 
zigzagging every which way. In a car with no air conditioning or 
power steering. And no bathroom breaks. 
</P>
<P>
	Welcome to Tony Stewart's world.  
</P>
<P>
	Stewart, a former Indy Racing League champion who's now NASCAR's  
hottest rookie, will try to become the first driver to complete the 
Indianapolis 500 and the Coca-Cola 600 in Concord, N.C., on the 
same day. 
</P>
<P>
	That's 1,100 miles in under 12 hours, 600 laps and a  
mind-numbing 2,400 left turns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like staying busy and I like being in race cars,'' he said.  
``The more I'm in a race car, the happier I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 28-year-old driver switched to NASCAR's Winston Cup circuit  
after three years of racing full time in the IRL, and has done 
better than anyone expected. He's had five top-10 finishes in his 
first 12 races, won one poll and is seventh in the point standings. 
</P>
<P>
	But there's something about Indy that keeps drawing him back.  
He's always had a fast car in the 500 -- he started on the pole as a 
rookie in 1996 and has led a total of 109 laps -- but he has been 
knocked out early by mechanical problems. 
</P>
<P>
	It's his hometown track, too. He grew up 45 miles south in  
Columbus, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	``To have the opportunity to run at the Indianapolis Motor  
Speedway and try to win the Indianapolis 500, I wasn't going to 
pass that up,'' he said. ``If we don't win it this year, I 
guarantee we'll probably do it again next year. I'm not giving up 
until we win the Indianapolis 500.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A year or two of this might make him reconsider, though.  
</P>
<P>
	First, there's the schedule. He's flown between Indianapolis and  
Concord so much the past two weeks he's practically on a first-name 
basis with the air traffic controllers. He's missed practices at 
each track, and didn't even have enough time to take photos with 
his crew after qualifying at Indy. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, he'll start from the eighth row in the Indy 500 and  
pray for clear skies and a clean race because he's out of there at 
3:30 p.m. CDT no matter what. 
</P>
<P>
	A helicopter will take him to the Indianapolis airport where The  
Home Depot, his sponsor, will have its private jet waiting for the 
50-minute flight to North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll get intravenous fluids on the plane and maybe squeeze in a  
little nap. When he touches down in Charlotte, N.C., he'll be 
whisked to another helicopter for the ride to Lowe's Motor 
Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	Then he'll jump into his stock car and start in the 27th spot  
for another five hours of driving. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anybody's capable of doing it and has the endurance to do  
it, it's Tony,'' said Andy Card, one of the co-owners of Stewart's 
IRL team. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two other drivers have attempted the double. John Andretti  
was the first in 1994, but he crashed in the Coca-Cola 600 and 
didn't finish the race. Robby Gordon's attempt in 1997 was rained 
out in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Even if he can survive the punishing schedule, Stewart still has  
to change cars. Driving an Indy car and a stock car isn't like 
switching between a Ford and Honda -- it's more like a Ferrari and 
an 18-wheeler. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this day and age, it's more specialized. Every race car  
driver in every series is a specialty driver now,'' Stewart said. 
``You don't see the A.J. Foyts and the Mario Andrettis, the guys 
that used to do it all. That day is long gone and there are only a 
couple of us that ever try to do it anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart is used to pulling double duty, though. Quadruple duty  
even. When he was racing in USAC, he once drove in four events in 
one day. There were countless weekends when he'd run a midget car 
on Friday night, a sprint car Saturday and a silver-crown car on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more he gets to do it, the sharper his skills are,'' said  
Larry Curry, crew chief of Stewart's Indy team. ``He is an absolute 
legitimate contender to win both of these races.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If he wins at Indianapolis, though, the party will have to wait.  
Stewart said he'll have time to take the traditional swig of milk, 
a few photos and that's about it before he takes off for Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
	That's OK, Card and Curry said. They'll whoop it up for him.  
</P>
<P>
	``I told Tony I'd stay in Victory Lane until Monday,'' Card  
said. ``And if he wins this thing, they better look out in 
Charlotte because here he comes.''

<HEADLINE> FDA OKs Arthritis Drug for Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some of the 50,000 American children who  
suffer debilitating rheumatoid arthritis won a potent new treatment 
Friday, the genetically engineered drug Enbrel. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors welcomed the much-needed therapy but warned that it  
should be reserved for children with moderate to severe arthritis 
who have failed standard therapy. That's because Enbrel comes with 
a safety question: Will it pose a serious risk of infection? 
</P>
<P>
	``It is somewhat concerning,'' acknowledged Dr. William  
Schwieterman of the Food and Drug Administration, which approved 
Enbrel for children but ordered its maker to continue monitoring 
that question. 
</P>
<P>
	But Schwieterman called Enbrel ``very good news'' for children  
who have had few options. ``It's very clear Enbrel is likely to 
provide a substantial number of them benefit,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Immunex Corp. began selling Enbrel for adult rheumatoid  
arthritis last winter. It attacks the disease in a way no other 
medicine does, soaking up an immune system protein called tumor 
necrosis factor that causes much of rheumatoid's inflammation 
before the substance can reach joints to damage them. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors who treat juvenile rheumatoid arthritis immediately  
clamored to know if Enbrel would help arthritis' smallest 
sufferers, too. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA approved Enbrel for children based on a study of 69  
moderate to severe patients ages 4 to 17 who failed standard 
treatment. Enbrel helped 74 percent of them improve. 
</P>
<P>
	Katie Emmerson of West Covina, Calif., moved from a wheelchair  
to the school swimming team after joining the Enbrel study 1 1/2 years 
ago. Initially, almost every joint was swollen and painful. She had 
failed all other therapies and was suffering severe side effects 
from painkillers. 
</P>
<P>
	``She hadn't been able to close her hand in two years, and she  
made a fist'' 48 hours after her first Enbrel injection, mother 
Patti Emmerson said. ``I'll never forget. ... She said, 'Mom, I 
feel so good.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Katie, 15, requires no other medication.  
</P>
<P>
	But the worry is that by inhibiting the immune system, Enbrel  
could cause infections. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, the FDA revealed that 30 of an estimated 25,000  
adult Enbrel users have developed serious infections, and six have 
died. The FDA ordered Immunex to study whether the drug is to 
blame. Meanwhile, doctors were warned not to give Enbrel to any 
adults with active or chronic infections, and to be cautious in 
prescribing it to people with diseases like diabetes that increase 
infection risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty-two percent of children studied suffered some infection,  
but all were mild cases, the FDA said. There's no way to tell if 
those were just routine childhood infections, but FDA said 
pediatricians should heed Enbrel's warnings and ordered Immunex to 
report how all child users fare. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kids do get infections multiple times during a year,''  
cautioned Dr. Steven Abramson of the Hospital for Joint Diseases, 
an expert on juvenile rheumatoid arthritis for the Arthritis 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	But until doctors learn more about the potential risk, Abramson  
urged that only children with serious disease who aren't helped by 
other treatments try Enbrel. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is perhaps the most effective drug doctors have seen'' in  
years, so they may want to use it widely, Abramson said. ``I would 
still err on the side of being very conservative.''

<HEADLINE> College Chefs Beef Up Skills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMHERST, Mass. (AP) -- Gourmet meals in college dining halls may  
seem like a paradox. 
</P>
<P>
	But at a weeklong competition at the University of  
Massachusetts, college chefs whipped up culinary delights that 
would actually make students look forward to cafeteria food. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sure beats what I have in my freezer -- hot dogs, nachos and  
things I can throw in the microwave!'' said Nathan Pekala, a 
college taste tester, as he wolfed down mounds of teriyaki beef, 
roasted corn, bean sprout melange, and globs of baked brie in 
phyllo dough with fresh berry sauce and grilled pineapple. 
</P>
<P>
	The Collegiate Cuisine 2000 conference gave more than 100 chefs,  
most of whom work in college dining halls, the chance to beef up on 
the latest trends in university cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
	With a captive clientele largely on meal plans, college  
cafeterias have long been complacent and bland, conference 
organizers acknowledged. Student tastes demand more now. 
</P>
<P>
	Changing student demographics and greater financial pressures  
are forcing college dining services to display food more 
enticingly, spice it more artfully, and serve more vegetarian and 
ethnic fare prepared to order, like a fine restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before, you put all these vegetables in a wok, and you called  
it Chinese food. Now, they want black bean sauce. They want oyster 
sauce,'' said Kenneth Toong, the Hong Kong-born head of dining 
services at the University of Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, there was a competition with chefs testing their  
recipes with a panel of judges. Several students were also picked 
to taste and evaluate the creations. 
</P>
<P>
	There were no dishes with water-logged lima beans or mashed  
potatoes with the Lake Tahoe of gravy. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the mystery meats were ostrich and rabbit. The  
asparagus was so crisp it snapped. And the potato jalapeno calamari 
quesadilla with red onion marmalade was more than a mouthful. 
</P>
<P>
	At the judges' table, chief instructor David St. John-Grubb  
(pronounced Groob, not Grub) prodded, poked, nibbled and 
scrutinized the creations the way others might ponder a Renoir. 
</P>
<P>
	In the kitchen, dozens of chefs -- all in traditional, tall white  
hats and coats -- were feverishly creating appetizers, entrees, side 
dishes and desserts with ingredients given to them. 
</P>
<P>
	Allan Lowen, a chef from Rutgers University, put final touches  
on plates of teriyaki beef on a bed of wild mushrooms with snow 
peas, red and yellow peppers, and Oriental noodles tied together by 
a green onion. 
</P>
<P>
	Lowen was most impressed at the workshops by ``all the different  
colors and different blends and different textures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The gold-medal team Friday won for its meal that included the  
calamari quesadilla, ostrich (skewered and grilled, if you please), 
marinated lamb roulade, and carrot cake with orange bourbon glaze. 
</P>
<P>
	The chef said nearly all the dishes can be duplicated at typical  
college dining halls with the right training and effort. 
</P>
<P>
	But Alex Batten, a 21-year-old vegetarian, said he and some  
other students are a touch skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
	``My initial reaction was, `You're never going to see this food  
in the dining commons,''' he said. ``But I think some of the 
elements would really carry over.''

<HEADLINE> McGwire, Sosa Meet Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa staged a long-ball  
derby last season that was unprecedented, and probably will never 
be matched. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since last season's historic homerfest, they  
were scheduled to meet on the same field as McGwire and the St. 
Louis Cardinals began a three-game series today at Wrigley Field 
against Sosa and the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	You know who everyone was watching -- every time they stepped to  
the plate, every time they took a swing. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great rivalry and always fun to play at Wrigley. But  
the focus should be on the Cards and Cubs, not McGwire and Sosa,'' 
McGwire said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeah, right.  
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Sosa's 66 homers didn't quite measure up. McGwire  
pulled away on the final weekend of the season, and his astounding 
70 homers might never be touched. 
</P>
<P>
	``The race was last year,'' Sosa said. ``Everybody knows what  
happened last year. We don't know what will happen this year, but 
to talk about it is too early. We still have another four months to 
go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, McGwire hit No. 14 for the year to share the Cards'  
team lead with Fernando Tatis. He has homered six times in the last 
eight games. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa, meanwhile, had 12 homers in his last 21 games and 16 this  
season before the Cubs got a day off Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Sosa and McGwire are trailing the likes of Ken Griffey  
Jr., Jose Canseco and Raul Mondesi, who's to say they can't catch 
up? 
</P>
<P>
	``We can have 10 or 12 home runs and then, in another 10-15  
days, we can hit 10-15 more home runs. That's just the way we 
are,'' Sosa said, perhaps recalling that his major league-record 20 
homers last June got him into the home run race. 
</P>
<P>
	When the Cubs and Cards last met, in September at Busch Stadium,  
McGwire tied Roger Maris, then passed him with the historic No. 62 
the next night off Chicago's Steve Trachsel. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa ran in from right field to congratulate his respected  
rival, and they exchanged their familiar greetings -- McGwire's fake 
punch to the stomach, Sosa's two-finger salute to the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa took the lead briefly on Sept. 25 with his 66th, but  
McGwire answered with his 66th the same night. 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa led McGwire one other time, last Aug. 19 at Wrigley. The  
lead lasted about an hour; Sosa hit his 48th before McGwire 
responded with two later in the same game to lead 49-48. 
</P>
<P>
	That's how they pushed one another, making what they  
accomplished seem more human, appealing even to people who didn't 
count themselves as baseball fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``They created thousands of new fans, hundreds of thousands of  
new fans really, around the country, gave them something to really 
latch on,'' Cubs manager Jim Riggleman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``So a lot of people who were not fans of the game at all  
watched and a lot of people who had left the game because of the 
strike came back. They would probably have gotten back eventually, 
but Mark and Sammy certainly speeded it up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wrigley Field is sold out this weekend, but Sosa and McGwire  
don't get all of the credit. The Cardinals and Cubs are one of the 
enduring matchups in the National League; thousands of St. Louis 
fans make the five-hour drive to Chicago, dotting the Wrigley seats 
and bleachers with their familiar red. 
</P>
<P>
	Now there are two more reasons to come.  
</P>
<P>
	``To have them both in the same ball park, that's special,'' St.  
Louis manager Tony LaRussa said. ``But their homers didn't make 
this series. The Cards and the Cubs were there a long time before 
Sammy and Mark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sosa would have you believe he'll be as low-key as McGwire  
predicts. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking forward to shaking his hand and going about my  
job,'' Sosa said. ``It will be the first time we play against each 
other and everybody is excited, you know. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's my friend. We're friends. That's it.''

<HEADLINE> Suit Threatens $200M in Dairy Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A dispute between New Mexico dairy farmers and  
the Agriculture Department over a $200 million aid package could 
jeopardize scores of emergency payments for dairy farmers across 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Mexico farmers last week filed a lawsuit in federal  
court in Albuquerque to stop the distribution of the payments. 
Specifically, they want USDA to change the formula it used to 
determine the payments, asserting the larger producers, like those 
in New Mexico, should get larger payments. 
</P>
<P>
	Payments are capped at $5,000 for the country's 116,000 dairy  
farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate comes at a time when dairy farmers have seen their  
prices slip. Several pieces of legislation are pending in hopes of 
preventing the industry from undergoing the price slump that hit 
commodities and hogs last year. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute also pits large scale farmers against smaller  
farmers at a time when many have complained about the erosion of 
small family farms. 
</P>
<P>
	``The secretary kind of divided us between two different  
categories of dairy industry,'' Sharon Lombardi, executive director 
of the Dairy Producers of New Mexico said Thursday. ``We should all 
be treated equally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We really have no desire to hurt producers of any size,''  
added Ben Yale, an Ohio lawyer representing the New Mexico farmers. 
``We're concerned that the secretary without authorization from 
Congress is starting to create a whole new dairy policy that 
threatens the type of dairy that goes on in the West.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $200 million in aid for dairy farmers was included in a $6  
billion farm bailout package passed by Congress last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sign-up for the payments ended last Friday, and the agency was  
expected to soon announce the disbursement of checks. It is unclear 
how the latest legal action will affect those plans. 
</P>
<P>
	USDA spokesman Andy Solomon said the agency could not comment on  
pending legal action, but said ``we structured this program so that 
it could be of maximum help to small and medium dairy producers in 
need. We believe we did the right thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under USDA's guidelines for issuing the payments, farmers can  
get paid a maximum of $5,000. That amount is the equivalent to the 
approximate production of a 150-cow herd. 
</P>
<P>
	The dispute arose because the 155 dairy farmers in New Mexico  
produce significantly more milk than that. The average farmer has a 
1,100-cow herd. Collectively, the New Mexico farmers, who rank 10th 
in milk production, produce about 4.2 billion pounds annually of 
the 160 billion pounds of milk produced nationwide, Yale said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dairy farmers pay federally mandated assessments according to  
the amount they produce so the aid payments shouldn't be different, 
Yale said. 
</P>
<P>
	As for the smaller producing farms, ``it would reduce some of  
their payments but the amount isn't going to make or break the 
survival of the small dairy farmer,'' Yale said. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Milk Producers Federation, while offering no  
comment on the lawsuit, had recommendations similar to USDA's final 
rule. The NMPF wanted to cap payments at $6,000.

<HEADLINE> Elf Aquitaine Bids for Saga Petroleum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OSLO, Norway (AP) -- The French energy concern Elf Aquitaine  
today made a $2.16 billion cash buyout offer for Norway's Saga 
Petroleum ASA, which already is considering an all-stock bid from 
state-controlled Norsk Hydro ASA. 
</P>
<P>
	The offer from Elf Aquitane came a day after Norsk Hydro made a  
deal with Saga's largest shareholder, the Norwegian state oil 
company Statoil ASA, that would split Saga Petroleum's assets 
between them as part of a takeover. 
</P>
<P>
	Elf is offering about 17 billion kroner, or $2.16 billion, in  
cash while Norsk Hydro wants to swap one of its own shares for 
three Saga shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Norsk Hydro's offer was valued at about $2.18 billion when it  
was announced May 10, but Elf Aquitane said its offer is 8 percent 
higher than the current value of Norsk Hydro's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Elf Aquitane, France's largest industrial company, entered the  
bidding with the blessing of Saga's management, which had wanted 
alternatives to Norsk Hydro's offer. Saga had objected to political 
pressures to keep the company in Norwegian hands, saying its 
shareholders had the right to the best possible offers. 
</P>
<P>
	Norsk Hydro would not immediately comment on Elf's counteroffer.  
Norsk Hydro's offer was contingent on 90 percent of Saga's 
shareholders accepting the bid, while Elf will settle for 67 
percent acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
	Elf, which has operated in Norway since 1965, would allow Saga  
Petroleum to continue to operate under its own name, and with 
considerable autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
	Saga employs about 4,000 people, but had announced plans for  
tough austerity measures after reporting losses for 1998 and the 
first quarter of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Norsk Hydro, the largest company listed on the Oslo Stock  
Exchange, employs about 40,000 people worldwide. It expects to cut 
about 800 jobs if the takeover goes through.

<HEADLINE> Ala. Puts New Limits on Jury Awards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Alabama, where a family who sued over  
$1,200 in satellite dish payments won a startling $581 million, is 
taking steps to curb the big jury verdicts that have given the 
state a reputation for dispensing ``jackpot justice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Don Siegelman this week signed bills that stop plaintiffs'  
lawyers from shopping around for friendly juries and judges and 
make it tougher to get lawsuits certified as class-actions. 
</P>
<P>
	A cap on punitive damages -- which are awarded by juries to  
punish wrongdoing in civil cases -- is expected to get final 
approval from the Legislature and Siegelman on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want the word to go forward now that this is not tort hell  
but it's a heavenly place to do business,'' said state Sen. Lowell 
Barron, a Democrat. 
</P>
<P>
	All this in the state where a jury awarded $4 million to a  
doctor who didn't like that BMW hadn't disclosed a repair paint job 
on his new car, and where a jury this month awarded $581 million to 
a family who claimed they were overcharged for two satellite 
dishes. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers and business groups who say the mammoth verdicts hurt  
Alabama's ability to attract companies have been pushing for years 
for changes in the state's tort laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The $581 million verdict, which a judge can still set aside or  
lower, was clearly on lawmakers' minds as they approved the reform 
measures. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no doubt that verdict helped push it over the edge,''  
said University of Alabama law professor Gene Marsh. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, insurance companies could be sued in any county in  
which they did business. That enabled plaintiffs to file their 
suits in rural counties known for large verdicts and a distrust of 
big corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	The new law limits those suits to the counties where the alleged  
wrongdoing occurred, where the corporation is based and where the 
customer lived at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	If the caps on damages are approved, punitive damages will be  
limited to three times the amount awarded in compensatory damages 
or $500,000, whichever is greater. That would means the verdict in 
the $581 million case would have been no higher than $3.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs' lawyers have said Alabama's consumer protection laws  
are so weak that such verdicts have been consumers' only real 
protection against being cheated. 
</P>
<P>
	And Greg Breedlove, president of the Alabama Trial Lawyers  
Association, said that if there is a problem with Alabama's tort 
laws, the courts can correct it. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, he said, the $4 million won in the BMW case was  
struck down by the Supreme Court and eventually sliced to $50,000. 
Breedlove also pointed to a 1997 study that showed damage verdicts 
were shrinking in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reality is we don't need wholesale changes to our tort  
law,'' he said. Instead, he said, the changes ``address the 
perception of that problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Bill O'Connor, the president of the Business Council of  
Alabama, said the large awards have hurt economic development, even 
though the state has landed marquee companies such as 
Mercedes-Benz, Boeing and Honda. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't know how many site selection lists we have been  
excluded from in the past, where we don't even make the cut to 
compete,'' O'Connor said. ``We do know that has been a problem.''

<HEADLINE> 1969 Valedictorians Look Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Fueled by the Vietnam War, racism and a  
bleak vision of the future, the graduates of 1969 stunned the 
nation with their angry but earnest commencement speeches. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsweek magazine called it the ``Anti-Commencement Day.''  
</P>
<P>
	Graduation speakers included a ``sprightly blonde'' named  
Hillary Rodham, who threw away her notes at Wellesley College and 
rebuked a senator for criticizing the younger generation's anti-war 
protests. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty years later, Mrs. Clinton is the very symbol of the  
establishment. Her critics may bemoan a loss of spontaneity, but 
valedictorians from the class of '69 say they still hold to their 
commencement ideals. 
</P>
<P>
	The graduate who really shocked the country was Stephanie Mills,  
who gave a gloom-and-doom address at exclusive Mills College in 
Oakland. In it, she vowed never to have children. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mills told graduates that the future was only a ``cruel  
hoax'' that promised little but an overpopulated world overwhelmed 
by hungry humanity. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Times called it ``perhaps the most anguished  
statement'' of the year's crop of valedictory speakers. Newsweek, 
in its roundup on graduation speeches, said her speech filled the 
ceremony with ``consternation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Mills has kept her vow.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think my fundamental concern with the state of the  
Earth has changed,'' she said. She joined Planned Parenthood within 
days of her speech, became an environmental activist and wrote 
books. Among her works is ``In Service of the Wild: Restoring and 
Reinhabiting Damaged Land.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had to do it over again, I wouldn't change any of the  
essentials,'' she said of the speech, although she concedes she 
might be a ``little less shrill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As an only child herself, she said she sometimes regrets not  
having children, but has a life ``filled with love and 
friendship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it was right,'' said Ms. Mills, who married briefly and  
lives with two cats and ``way too many books'' near Maple City, 
Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton made news mostly for the comments she directed at  
the dignified U.S. Sen. Edward Brooke, R-Mass., who was the first 
black elected to the Senate by popular vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Brooke had ticked off a list of advances the government had  
made, noting that the number of poor families had dropped from 22 
percent of the population in 1959 to 13.3 per cent in 1967. And he 
chastised the younger generation's protests against the war. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodham then stepped up to the microphone and condemned Brooke's  
``empty rhetoric.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What does it mean that 13.3 percent of Americans are poor? How  
about talking about the humans, not the statistics?'' she said, 
urging her fellow graduates to change the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel that our prevailing, acquisitive and competitive  
corporate life, including tragically, the universities, is not the 
way of life for us,'' she said, striking such an anti-establishment 
chord that Life magazine printed excerpts from her speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that she's the embodiment of the establishment, the first  
lady rarely gives unscripted public remarks. Asked if she had 
changed any of her opinions, she said through a spokeswoman that 
she would have no comment. 
</P>
<P>
	While Mrs. Clinton has been praised for her work on children's  
issues and other causes, some of her former classmates feel she's 
been too constrained as the wife of the president to be an 
effective activist. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hillary has the whole world, but she can't use what she has,''  
Nancy Young says in ``Rebels in White Gloves,'' a book about the 
lives of the women in Wellesley's class of 1969. ``What little 
spontaneity she ever had is gone. She has become just robotic, a 
cardboard person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ira Magaziner, who went on to join Mrs. Clinton in a failed  
attempt to reform the nation's health care system, also gave a 
commencement address that year, an idealistic speech at Brown 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should lose sleep because we are doing things that are  
wrong and we're allowing things that are wrong to go on in our 
society and we're accepting them,'' Magaziner said then. 
</P>
<P>
	In the years since, he and Mrs. Clinton have joked about their  
speeches, but he says he still refuses to compromise his ideals. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still accused of being an idealist,'' said Magaziner, who  
spent six years as a senior adviser in the Clinton administration. 
``I don't object to that. I hope I have matured, but my basic 
ideals to public service have stayed the same.''

<HEADLINE> Details of Clinton Approval Ratings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A year-by-year breakdown of President Clinton's job approval  
ratings in the CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll: 
</P>
<P>
	--1993: 58 percent job approval after inauguration, but drops to  
37 percent by June after problems choosing an attorney general 
candidate and decision on dropping ban on gays in the military. By 
December, rate climbs to 54 percent after successes with Brady Bill 
restricting handgun sales and the North American Free Trade 
Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	--1994: Starts year at 54 percent in January, but public sours on  
health care reform plan and job approval slips to 39 percent by 
September, with 54 percent not approving. Republicans sweep to 
power in Congress in November. 
</P>
<P>
	--1995: Starts at 47 percent in January and stays in the 40s much  
of the year, but edges back to 53 percent in December after 
confrontation with Republicans over government shutdown. 
</P>
<P>
	--1996: Approval at 58 percent to start year, moves to 62 percent  
by mid-January, stays in the high 50s and low 60s much of the year, 
though dipping to 52 percent in mid-August. 
</P>
<P>
	--1997: Rating starts at 58 percent in January and stays in the  
high 50s and low 60s all year. 
</P>
<P>
	--1998: Approval jumps to 69 percent after the first news of the  
Monica Lewinsky investigation. It stays in the 60s throughout the 
year and spikes to 73 percent in December after the House votes for 
impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	--1999: Job approval is 63 percent in January and stays in mid to  
high 60s during impeachment trial. By April, rating is at 60 
percent and it slips to 53 percent in late May as the Kosovo 
conflict drags on, lowest approval rating since August 1996.

<HEADLINE> Graduation at School Shooting Site </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONYERS, Ga. (AP) -- The Heritage High School Class of 1999  
graduated Friday night and came together one last time in the 
school commons where six fellow students were wounded by a 
classmate who opened fire eight days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	While none of those wounded were among the 275 seniors, the  
violence that seemed to shatter their lives last week brought them 
together at graduation, said Steven Brown, a school counselor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Usually they never hang out this long after graduation. This  
never happens,'' Brown said after the ceremony ended and students 
remained in the commons area for 45 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Seniors went back to the commons to cheer, hug and celebrate  
their accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
	``They bounced back real quick and they didn't let it faze  
them,'' Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
	All six students who were wounded May 20 when a student began  
shooting in the commons area were released from the hospital after 
being treated for gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect, T.J. Solomon, 15, faces 20 counts of aggravated  
assault, cruelty to children and weapons charges. District Attorney 
Richard Read has said he will ask a juvenile court judge to allow 
Solomon to be tried as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the last eight days, Heritage has been known worldwide for  
a single incident -- a tragedy,'' Shaffiq Welgi said during his 
speech in the packed gym. ``My 13 years of schooling, however, have 
made me look at that day's events as a single occurrence, minuscule 
in appearance of the achievements of our class of 1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Extra officers patrolled the ceremony, which parents and  
teachers tried to focus on achievements rather than a rehash of the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Forget about the past, we are the future,'' Class President  
Martin Humphrey said as the ceremony came to a close.

<HEADLINE>  Crosses Near Auschwitz Removed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WARSAW, Poland (AP) -- Troops backed by police and priests  
removed 300 crosses Friday from a lot bordering the former 
Auschwitz death camp, a move intended to end the long-running 
controversy between Jewish groups and Poland's Roman Catholic 
Church. 
</P>
<P>
	The move came eight days before Pope John Paul II begins his  
eighth pilgrimage to his homeland to stress, among other things, 
religious tolerance in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
	Soldiers took the crosses -- some crude and handmade while others  
were thick, varnished ones with metal nameplates -- to a Franciscan 
friars' cloister. 
</P>
<P>
	They left behind a large, wooden cross placed on the site more  
than a decade ago to honor 152 Polish Catholics killed there by the 
Nazis in 1941. 
</P>
<P>
	The 26-foot papal cross, from a 1979 Mass celebrated by the pope  
at the nearby Birkenau death camp, launched the controversy between 
the Polish church and Jewish groups that argued the cross insulted 
the memory of more than 1 million Jews killed at Auschwitz and 
Birkenau. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative Catholics erected the smaller crosses near the  
papal cross in the past year to oppose Jewish demands for its 
removal. By taking away the smaller crosses Friday, church and 
government officials wanted to display a unified resolve to combat 
Poland's reputation for anti-Semitism linked to the Holocaust and 
the Soviet era. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Adam Schulz, spokesman for the Polish Episcopate, the  
church's top body, said he hoped the move would ``present us in a 
new, better light'' and ``show our maturity and moral and spiritual 
sensitivity to the world public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schulz and a government spokesman also said they believed Jewish  
groups would accept the lone papal cross as a compromise and a 
valid commemoration of Polish victims of the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ephraim Zuroff of the Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Nazi  
watchdog group, insisted there was ``no compromise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue is not extra crosses. The issue is all crosses,'' he  
said. ``There is no room for religious symbols at Auschwitz or 
Birkenau. The attempt to place crosses is an attempt to 
Christianize a place of mass murder where the overwhelming number 
of victims were Jewish.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jewish groups protested immediately when the papal cross was  
erected in 1988 on the property bordering Auschwitz, near the 
former camp's notorious penal block and Death Wall, where thousands 
of prisoners were shot to death. Years of acrimony and failed talks 
followed. 
</P>
<P>
	When Polish officials indicated last year the papal cross might  
be removed, Catholic activist Kazimierz Switon launched a hunger 
strike and moved into a tent on the property to protect it. 
</P>
<P>
	Switon, 68, rallied conservative Catholics to plant hundreds  
more crosses on the site, which became a circus-like gathering of 
his supporters, tourists and passers-by. Anti-Semitic pamphlets 
were common, and Switon often said he was protecting the cross 
against the excessive power of Jews in Poland. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversy embarrassed Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek's  
government as it prepared for Poland to join NATO and seek 
membership in the European Union. It began a lengthy legal process 
to obtain control of the property, leased to a war veterans' group 
sympathetic to Switon. 
</P>
<P>
	Roman Catholic bishops initially complained Jewish groups  
demanded too much, but later sided with the government's call to 
remove all crosses but the papal cross. 
</P>
<P>
	A new law that took effect Tuesday gave the government control  
over the area surrounding former Nazi camps, including the lot 
bordering Auschwitz. On Wednesday, local authorities in Oswiecim, 
the town where the Auschwitz camp is located, ordered a wooden 
chapel Switon had built on the property torn down as an illegal 
structure. 
</P>
<P>
	Switon responded by announcing Thursday that he put explosive  
devices in the hut to protect it. Police quickly detonated the 
explosives and arrested Switon. 
</P>
<P>
	``Switon's lawless behavior sped up the removal of the  
crosses,'' Interior Ministry spokesman Pawel Ciach said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Faults Japan on Computer Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- U.S. computer companies continue to face obstacles  
in the Japanese government market and Japan should work harder to 
give them better access, U.S. officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``U.S. computer hardware and software companies, which are  
global technology leaders with long-term commitments to the 
Japanese market, continue to encounter difficulties in gaining full 
access to the Japanese government market,'' the U.S. Embassy said 
in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement came after an annual review of implementation of  
measures related to Japanese government procurement of computer 
products and services. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. government and American companies have long complained  
that Japan shuts out foreign firms though a complex web of 
government regulations and informal barriers such as cozy ties 
among domestic enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
	At Friday's review meeting, the Japanese government showed that  
for fiscal 1997, which ended on March 31, 1998, the foreign share 
of Japanese government procurement of computers and computer 
systems was 16.5 percent, up from 15.9 percent a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	In comparison, foreign computer companies represent 35 percent  
of the private sector market, the U.S. Embassy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. representatives urged their Japanese counterparts to  
take steps to enhance fairness and transparency in government 
procurement.

<HEADLINE> Stocks End Higher; Dow Up 92.81 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks finished a turbulent week with solid  
gains Friday as new data showing slower-than-expected economic 
growth helped calm fears about rising inflation and higher interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors also jumped at the chance to pick up shares at cheaper  
prices as a result of Wall Street's slump this week. 
</P>
<P>
	After tumbling 235 points Thursday, its worst drop in eight  
months, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 92.81 points Friday, 
or by 0.9 percent, to close at 10,559.74. The blue-chip index was 
up as much as 122 points in afternoon trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader indexes were also higher. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose  
20.43 to 1,301.84, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index 
rose 51.37 to 2,470.52. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow seesawed all week with declines of more than 1 percent  
on both Monday and Tuesday, then a rebound of more than 1 percent 
on Wednesday before tumbling 2.2 percent Thursday. With Friday's 
gains, the average ended down 269.54 points, or by 2.5 percent, for 
the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow also finished down 2.1 percent for the month of May, its  
steepest monthly decline of the year. But it is up 15 percent for 
the first five months of 1999, a much stronger performance than 
many expected when the year began. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was light Friday as market professionals eased into the  
three-day holiday weekend. U.S. financial markets will be closed 
Monday in observance of Memorial Day. 
</P>
<P>
	The low volume and broad-based gains provided an antidote to the  
week's volatile ride on Wall Street. The market swung amid 
persistent fears that any signs of rising inflation will prompt the 
Federal Reserve to raise interest rates. Higher rates typically cut 
into profits as it becomes more expensive for companies to borrow 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still are in a tug-of-war between those people who think  
interest rates will go higher and those that don't,'' said Alan 
Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	But some of the fears about rising inflation and interest rates  
were tempered after the Purchasing Management Association of 
Chicago on Friday reported a greater-than-expected drop in its 
business activity index. 
</P>
<P>
	That helped boost stocks, especially banks and financial  
services shares, which have been hurt by concerns over an 
interest-rate hike. Citigroup rose 2 13/16 to 66 1/4 and American 
Express gained 4 3/16 to 121 1/16. 
</P>
<P>
	A flood of bargain-hunters entering the market Friday also  
helped lift stocks. Investors were looking to pick up stocks at 
much cheaper prices than they were just a week ago. Microsoft 
gained 2 5/16 to close at 80 11/16 and Amazon.com rose 4 3/16 to 
118 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tech stocks and Internet stocks look like they've reached  
some sort of bottom,'' said Barry Hyman, senior equity analyst at 
Ehrenkrantz King Nussbaum. ``That sector has gotten so beaten up, 
it's encouraging to see them looking like they're coming back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The high-tech stocks have been especially weak throughout the  
interest-rate watch. Because many of them trade at prices far above 
their earnings, they become less appealing to investors when 
corporate profits are threatened by higher rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Government data due out next Tuesday should provide a stronger  
indication of the economy's health. The National Association of 
Purchasing Management will release its monthly survey on 
manufacturing activity nationwide, and the Conference Board will 
report on leading economic Indicators for April. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2-to-1  
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 782.8 
million shares, compared with 978.9 million Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 8.24 to 622.26, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 4.35 to 778.74. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies gained 5.76 to 438.68. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 1.26 percent.  
Germany's DAX index closed up 0.1 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 was 
up 0.4 percent, and France's CAC-40 closed 0.3 percent lower.

<HEADLINE> Gators Give Donovan 5-Year Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- As Billy Donovan's reputation grows, so  
does the cost of keeping him at Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Hoping to stave off a bidding war for one of college  
basketball's top young coaches, Florida's athletic director agreed 
to terms with Donovan Friday on a five-year contract worth $700,000 
per season. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal will replace the $500,000-per-year extension Donovan  
signed last year. It will make him the third-highest paid coach in 
the Southeastern Conference, behind Tubby Smith of Kentucky and 
Nolan Richardson of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
	Donovan, who turns 34 Sunday, said he had been contacted by  
other schools last season, but had no intention of leaving 
regardless of his contract status. 
</P>
<P>
	``We not only have some good basketball players here, but  
they're quality kids, kids I enjoy coaching,'' Donovan said. ``To 
go somewhere else and start all over again doesn't really make any 
sense.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donovan, who learned his game as a player at Providence and an  
assistant to Rick Pitino at Kentucky, led the Gators from a 
sub-.500 record three years ago to a spot in the round of 16 of the 
NCAA tournament last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Aware of Donovan's popularity, Athletic Director Jeremy Foley  
wanted to prevent other schools from upping the ante in an effort 
to steal him away. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were worried about another school coming in here and trying  
to nab him,'' Foley said. ``Especially because Florida doesn't yet 
have all the basketball tradition that some other schools do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foley is trying to prevent what happened after the 1995-96  
season, when Lon Kruger left the school for a more established 
program at Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, pre-emptive strikes are nothing new at Florida, which  
has one of the highest-paid coaching staffs in the country, across 
the board. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Foley renegotiated with football coach Steve Spurrier,  
a perennial candidate for NFL jobs. Spurrier stayed in Gainesville 
for a $2 million-per-year extension that remains the richest in 
college football. 
</P>
<P>
	Donovan is on track to take the basketball program to where the  
football program has been since Spurrier arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second straight season, Donovan has brought in a top  
recruiting class, adding McDonald's All-Americans Donnell Harvey 
and Brett Nelson to last year's class, which included Mike Miller, 
Teddy Dupay and Udonis Haslem, all of whom were key in the Gators' 
surge. 
</P>
<P>
	Donovan said he has been encouraged by renovations to the  
O'Connell Center and plans for an $8 million practice facility. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sends a message to me, to recruits, to kids on campus,''  
Donovan said. ``They see a practice facility going up, and all the 
other things that allow us to keep up with the Kentuckys and North 
Carolinas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Donovan went 13-17 and 14-15 in his first two years. But the big  
recruiting class of last season paid quick dividends, as the Gators 
finished 22-9 and made it to the tournament for the first time in 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Included in the contract are Donovan's apparel and media deals.  
He is eligible for bonuses that include an extra month's salary for 
making the NCAA tournament and 2 1/2 months' salary if the Gators win 
the national title. It also includes incentives for graduating 
certain percentages of his players.

<HEADLINE> FCC Tries To Conserve Phone Numbers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Telephone regulators want to slow down the  
creation of new area codes and spare phone users from continually 
having to learn new dialing patterns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission responded to the  
proliferation of new area codes in recent years by asking for 
public guidance Thursday on ways to conserve the pool of phone 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry officials and others will have three months to comment  
on several commission proposals. Adoption of at least some of the 
proposals could come early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This item's long overdue,'' said Commissioner Gloria Tristani.  
``We're in a crisis with numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	FCC Chairman Bill Kennard said the need to change area codes  
imposes real costs to business and residential customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers have to go through the trouble of alerting friends  
and relatives to the changes, and businesses have to spend money 
notifying their customers,'' he said. ``If we take responsible 
action now, we can avoid confronting a catastrophe in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Growing demand for cellular phones, pagers and second lines for  
modems and fax machines is often blamed. But more at fault is the 
way numbers are assigned, in blocks of 10,000, which leaves many 
numbers unused. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Pennsylvania goes from four area codes in 1994 to  
nine on June 5. California is projected to have at least 39 by 
2001, three times the 13 it had early 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Maine is considering a second area code, even though the 7.92  
million number combinations available ought to be enough for every 
man, woman and child in the state to have a modem line, a fax 
machine line, a pager and two cell phones, as well as a regular 
phone. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States now has about 215 area codes, almost double  
the 119 in service in 1991. Industry officials project the need for 
30 new codes a year unless changes are made. 
</P>
<P>
	The relief options outlined by the commission would not stop new  
area codes in the works but could prevent or delay the need for 
others in the future. Officials said the commission was likely to 
adopt more than one conservation mechanism. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the existing block system, created in the days of the  
telephone monopoly, competing local carriers acquire a block of 
10,000 numbers for every billing region they wish to serve. An area 
code may cover dozens or hundreds of such regions. 
</P>
<P>
	If a carrier has only 100 customers in a given region, the  
remaining 9,900 numbers of the block are tied up. As few as half of 
the available number combinations for each area code are actually 
assigned before a new code is requested. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission proposed assigning numbers in smaller blocks,  
such as 1,000 at a time, and expanding the size of billing regions 
to reduce the number of blocks needed. The commission also proposed 
administrative changes to require telephone companies to assign 
more of their numbers before requesting new blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Also under consideration is an end to the existing ban on  
assigning different area codes for different types of technology. 
That could pave the way for the use of separate area codes for cell 
phones and pagers outside New York City, where such a mechanism was 
set up before the ban was imposed. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission also said it would review ways to charge  
companies that want blocks of numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem that we have is that a resource that has  
substantial value is given away for free,'' said Commissioner 
Harold Furchtgott-Roth.

<HEADLINE> EU Raids Danish Sugar Manufacturer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- European Union antitrust investigators  
have raided the offices of Danish sugar manufacturer Danisco as 
part of a probe into possible pricing abuses, the EU said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The EU's probe is focussing on the Danish and Swedish markets,  
said Stefan Rating, spokesman for Karel Van Miert, the EU's 
competition commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Commission is cooperating with Danish authorities  
on the case, Rating told reporters. He did not say when the 
commission will announce its findings from the raids and declined 
to provide further details. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission, which is the EU's executive branch, acts as  
antitrust watchdog for the 15-nation bloc. It has wide powers to 
investigate cartels and monopolies in addition to checking the 
impact of major mergers on EU markets.

<HEADLINE>  Cohen Confident on Kosovo Outcome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen said today he  
is increasingly confident that NATO's air campaign will succeed in 
restoring ethnic Albanian refugees to their homes in Kosovo before 
winter sets in. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview on Day 66 of Operation Allied Force, Cohen told  
reporters there is no consensus in NATO for turning the conflict 
into a ground war, and he insisted the air campaign is succeeding. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am increasingly confident, given the amount of damage we are  
doing day by day,'' Cohen said. He also asserted there are 
``signals'' of declining morale and increasing discontent within 
the ranks of the Serb army in Kosovo, and he noted sporadic reports 
of anti-war demonstrations in some Serb towns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just going to intensify this until such time as we're  
satisfied that this can be brought to a successful conclusion,'' 
Cohen said. He emphasized that the Clinton administration has no 
intention of introducing ground troops into Kosovo until there is a 
peace settlement with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen also predicted that Milosevic eventually will be brought  
to justice to face the war-crimes charges announced this week by an 
international tribunal. ``One day he will,'' the defense secretary 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the top intelligence officer for the Joint Chiefs  
of Staff said NATO's bombing has destroyed large chunks of the 
Serbian military while strengthening and emboldening a rebel 
militia on the ground in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kosovo Liberation Army has tripled in size from about 5,000  
guerrilla troops at the start of the air campaign in March to 
between 15,000 and 17,000 now, Rear Adm. Thomas Wilson said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	While far fewer than the estimated 40,000 Serb army and police  
troops in Kosovo, the KLA is effective at attacking Serb forces 
essentially pinned down by the NATO bombing, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO insists the ethnic Albanian KLA is not a partner in the  
fight against Milosevic and his Serb forces in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wilson said NATO wants to help take out Serb tanks, armored  
personnel carriers and artillery because the equipment represents a 
major advantage that Serb forces now have over the KLA. 
</P>
<P>
	``So we believe that it's important to continue to destroy that  
equipment and also to try to make it immobile and keep them kind of 
out of the fight, because it tends to level the playing field 
between the KLA and the army,'' Wilson said at a briefing for 
reporters at the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson also gave a detailed assessment of the damage inflicted  
so far on Serb forces, including a 35 percent reduction in 
broadcast capability of Serb television and radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson said the Serb air defense forces have lost about half of  
their more sophisticated surface-to-air missiles, the 
Soviet-designed SA-3s and SA-6s. 
</P>
<P>
	Bombs have destroyed more than 20 Serb early warning radars, and  
seven of the nine major military airfields in Serbia are out of 
commission, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson said the war-crimes indictment of Milosevic announced  
Thursday will not change NATO's military objectives. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said the charges against the Yugoslav leader  
and four other top Serb officials ``will help to deter future war 
crimes by establishing that those who give orders will be held 
accountable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment alleges a long list of crimes against ethnic  
Albanians in the disputed Serb province of Kosovo, including 
causing an exodus of refugees. Ethnic Albanians were a majority in 
Kosovo before the war began, but a minority elsewhere in Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  
Staff, said refugee camps outside Yugoslavia are being readied for 
the NATO campaign to continue into cold weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at a news conference in North Carolina where he was  
getting an award, Shelton said, ``Winterization of the camps will 
enable (bombing) to go right on into the winter if that is 
required.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton said the air attacks are proceeding as military planners  
expected and that achieving goals would take time. 
</P>
<P>
	The KLA is successfully recruiting among ethnic Albanian  
refugees now congregated in camps in neighboring Balkan countries, 
Pentagon officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has tried to keep the KLA at arm's length throughout the  
fight over Kosovo, leery of close association with a guerrilla 
force with different aims and possibly unsavory tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	The KLA is fighting for Kosovo's independence from Serbia, while  
NATO has favored autonomy for the province but not outright 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it is obvious that even a ragtag army on the ground could  
be helpful to NATO as the alliance relies exclusively on air power 
to rout the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	``They appear to be a resurgent group which has taken advantage  
of NATO airstrikes, a general western sympathy and a groundswell of 
volunteer fighters,'' Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The KLA is also benefiting from more organized leadership and  
improved supply lines, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Wilson was not implying a  
new coziness with the KLA. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just stated the obvious, which is that after 64 days of  
pounding, the (Serbs) have been diminished in their capability,'' 
Bacon said. ``Our goal has never been to empower the KLA to create 
more fighting. Our goal has been to end fighting in Kosovo.''

<HEADLINE> Votes To Beef Up Lab Security Wait </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The bipartisanship that accompanied this  
week's release of a House report on alleged nuclear espionage by 
China was short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
	Just days later, Democrats and Republicans are accusing each  
other of playing politics with the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Votes on measures to increase security substantially at  
Department of Energy weapons laboratories and to tighten export 
controls prompted divisive debate and were then put off until after 
a 10-day Memorial Day recess in both the House and Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democrats used delaying tactics late Thursday to stall a  
GOP-sponsored measure that would reorganize the Energy Department 
after the proposal drew a veto threat from the Clinton 
administration. The proposal would create a new assistant secretary 
for defense programs who would report directly to the president and 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., postponed action on that  
measure to prevent it from further delaying completion of a $288.8 
billion Defense Department spending bill for the fiscal year that 
begins Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure, approved 92-3, would provide $8.3 billion more than  
President Clinton requested for a variety of Pentagon programs for 
next year, including a 4.8 percent across-the-board military pay 
raise next Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	While the bill would provide some measures to beef up security  
at weapons labs and to intensify congressional oversight, Lott told 
reporters that Democrats had ``basically shut down'' the Senate 
over the more far-reaching reform proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to get real security until we have a whole  
other arrangement at DOE,'' Lott said. ``It's not about fixing 
blame. It's about fixing the problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., who led the Democratic delaying  
tactics, said, ``This is the wrong time for this amendment. This is 
not the time for debate on reorganization the Department of 
Energy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, efforts to debate the China espionage issue in the  
House never got off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The House version of the defense bill was ``pulled'' Thursday by  
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. Hastert acted after Democrats 
complained they weren't getting a chance to offer their own 
amendments on the China issue, and GOP conservatives complained 
that the bill was too supportive of the administration's Kosovo 
policy. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an insult,'' said Rep. Norman Dicks, D-Wash., the senior  
Democrat on the special House committee that issued the report that 
claimed 20 years of Chinese nuclear espionage. He said procedures 
put in place by House GOP leaders barred him from offering 
amendments dealing with the China investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	One amendment would have supported current administration  
efforts to tighten security. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., chairman of the espionage  
investigation, told reporters that Dicks should have been allowed 
to present his amendment and suggested there had been a 
misunderstanding. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Senate Republicans' complaints about Democratic stalling  
tactics, the defense bill passed by the Senate does contain 
measures to address the China espionage issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The package includes $35 million to enhance computer security at  
Energy Department nuclear labs and another $17 million to upgrade 
security clearance investigations of employees. 
</P>
<P>
	It also includes a package offered by Lott and supported by  
Democratic leaders that would expand the role of intelligence 
agencies in reviewing export licenses. It also would boost Pentagon 
monitoring of satellite launches in China and require the 
administration to report to Congress on any security breaches. 
</P>
<P>
	The impasse on the Senate side came over an amendment by  
Republican Sens. Pete Domenici of New Mexico, Frank Murkowski of 
Alaska and Jon Kyl of Arizona to create a new assistant secretary 
for defense programs in the Energy Department. That official would 
have wide-ranging authority and could bypass the energy secretary 
in dealing directly with the president and Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy Secretary Bill Richardson opposed the proposal as too  
extensive and complained in a letter to Senate leaders: ``This 
proposal would effectively cancel my six-month effort to strengthen 
security.'' He said it might prompt an administration veto threat. 
</P>
<P>
	The three who voted against Senate passage of the defense bill  
were Democratic Sens. Russ Feingold and Herbert Kohl of Wisconsin 
and Paul Wellstone of Minnesota. Those not voting were Ernest 
Hollings, D-S.C.; Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.; Richard Lugar, R-Ind.; 
Connie Mack, R-Fla., and Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	The bills are H.R. 1401 and S 1059.

<HEADLINE> Harness Driver Returns To Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- George Brennan, the nation's  
leading harness driver until being suspended in a controversial 
ruling by the New Jersey Racing Commission, returned to racing 
Friday after getting a stay from the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan picked up six drives on the 12-race card at the  
Meadowlands Racetrack, which had sought to bar him, and he 
eventually got back to the winner's circle with longshot Maxwells 
Champ ($32.80) in his fifth race back. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that the state-owned  
track could not do that while Brennan's case is being reviewed by a 
state appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan was suspended by the racing commission on April 10 for  
an unsatisfactory effort in a race on March 10 at Freehold Raceway, 
a race in which an investigation found some questionable betting. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to be back racing,'' Brennan said after his third  
drive. ``I just really appreciate the trainers sticking by me, it 
means a lot to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As he said that, the emotion was evident in Brennan's eyes and  
voice. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan's win came in the 10th race when he had a perfect trip  
with Maxwells Champ, taking the lead in the stretch and barely 
holding off Palmer Seelster at the wire. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan finished third in the first race with Our Commitment.  
Just prior to the race, a fan near the outside apron of the track 
held up a banner, welcoming the driver back and wishing him luck. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just felt good to be out there making a living again,''  
Brennan said. ``The fans treated me great. The one guy was out 
there with the sign and it was great knowing the fans and my fellow 
colleagues were behind me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The one difference Brennan noticed was that his hands felt a  
little weak after six weeks of not handling horses, which weigh 
about 1,000 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I should be all right after about 15 or 20 races,'' said  
Brennan, who drove in a couple of qualifying races on Friday 
morning, winning one. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan was 13th and last in the third race when Southwind  
Miranda broke stride shortly after the start. The 32-year-old was 
seventh in both the fifth and ninth races. He finished fifth in the 
11th race, his final drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan was suspended based on his drive of My Dream Come True  
at Freehold Raceway on March 10. The racing commission ruled that 
``the drive was unsatisfactory due to a lack of effort'' and cited 
its rules against ``fraudulent or unsatisfactory driving'' and 
``conduct detrimental to the sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan had his finest season in 1998, finishing third with 172  
winners in 1,200 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of Brennan's drives on Friday developed because Catello  
Manzi was unable to drive because of an injury sustained at 
Freehold on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court probably won't rule for at least two months on  
whether the Meadowlands has the right to bar Brennan, so it is 
likely he will be able to race through the end of the current meet, 
which ends in early August.

<HEADLINE> D.C. Shooting Case Decision Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal judge has postponed for three weeks  
a decision on whether the man accused of slaying two Capitol Hill 
police officers can be forced to take medication that doctors 
believe could make him mentally fit to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
	At a hearing Friday, U.S. District Court Judge Emmet Sullivan  
deferred the decision on Russell Eugene Weston Jr. until June 18. 
</P>
<P>
	Weston is charged with murdering Capitol Police officers John M.  
Gibson and Jacob J. Chestnut in the Capitol on July 24, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, a federal judge ruled that Weston, 42, was not  
competent to stand trial, after psychiatrist Sally C. Johnson, an 
associate warden at the Butner facility, said she believed Weston 
was a paranoid schizophrenic. But she did not rule out the 
possibility that Weston could stand trial after he receives 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	Confined at a federal prison hospital in Butner, N.C., Weston  
has refused medications prescribed by psychiatrists. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's been refusing to take his medication and not really  
cooperating with doctors down there,'' said Channing Phillips, 
spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorneys have filed papers arguing that forcing Weston  
to take medication could violate his constitutional rights and 
could have harmful mental and physical effects.

<HEADLINE> TLC Beatrice To Liquidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- TLC Beatrice International Holdings Inc., once  
the nation's largest black-owned company, is being liquidated as 
part of an evolving strategy begun following the death of its 
founder Reginald Lewis six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The liquidation plan, announced Thursday along with the sale of  
its Spanish soft drink division, is expected to return a healthy 
profit for investors and the Lewis family, the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's in line with the long-term goal to generate shareholder  
wealth that Lewis set when he bought the company in 1987 in a $985 
million leveraged buyout, said his widow Loida Nicolas Lewis -- now 
the company's chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Lewis built the rocket ship,'' she said. ``He and I knew  
where he wanted to take it. That's basically what happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis died of brain cancer in 1993 at age 50. Mrs. Lewis said  
that, while she had not originally intended to liquidate the 
company, a detailed examination of its growth potential convinced 
management that was the best course. 
</P>
<P>
	Throughout its short life, TLC Beatrice has been hailed as a  
success story. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1987, when TLC Beatrice reported revenue of $1.8 billion, it  
became the first black-owned company to have more than $1 billion 
in annual sales. The company then began its reign at the top of 
Black Enterprise magazine's annual list of the country's 100 
biggest black-owned companies. 
</P>
<P>
	TLC Beatrice, which was closely held by the Lewis family and  
associates, hit its peak in 1996 when it had $2.23 billion in 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
	Other companies weren't even close. In 1996, for example,  
Johnson Publishing Co. of Chicago ranked second on the BE 100 list 
with $325.7 million in sales. Philadelphia Coca-Cola Bottling Co. 
ranked third with $325 million in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a model that we will continue to follow,'' said Earl  
Graves, the publisher of Black Enterprise magazine. Graves employed 
Lewis, an attorney, to represent him when he bought radio stations 
in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis epitomized a break from traditional investment patterns  
among blacks in which entrepreneurs might own one or two companies 
for life. 
</P>
<P>
	``As black entrepreneurs acquire new businesses and develop  
strategic alliances, they will in many instances, as evidenced by 
Reginald Lewis, sell their companies, realize capital gains and use 
the process to capitalize on new business opportunities,'' Graves 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Following Lewis' death, his company went through a period of  
management and shareholder turmoil, with Mrs. Lewis finally taking 
over a year later. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I assumed office, I did not know what course to take,''  
Mrs. Lewis said in an interview. She considered several strategies, 
including an initial public offering and further acquisitions in 
order to enhance shareholder wealth. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew the end goal, but going there is not always evident,''  
she said. ``Initially, there was no thought of selling all of the 
company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The TLC Beatrice saga began in working class Baltimore where  
Lewis was a standout athlete whose bright future ended in a knee 
injury. He was invited to enter Harvard Law School without making 
an application after he impressed school officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis wound up on Wall Street engaged in mergers and  
acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1984, he caught his first big wave. He bought the McCall  
Pattern Co., a supplier of sewing instructions, retooled it and 
sold it in 1987 at a 90-to-1 return on investment. 
</P>
<P>
	While the McCall sale impressed many on Wall Street, it was his  
move that December that took him over the top. 
</P>
<P>
	In a leveraged buyout partly funded by junk bond financier  
Michael Milken, Lewis used his TLC Group to take over a part of 
Beatrice International. Lewis sold off some of the food company's 
subsidiaries and grew what was left into TLC Beatrice, a food 
processing and distribution company based in the United States but 
whose operations were mainly in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1992, Forbes magazine listed Lewis among the 400 richest  
Americans with a net worth estimated at $400 million and TLC 
Beatrice as the 74th largest privately-held company in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Before his death, Lewis set a plan in motion to install a  
brother, Jean Fugett Jr., as the new chairman. Fugett was ousted a 
year later and Mrs. Lewis took over. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, the company was embroiled in a fight with Lewis'  
business partners at Milken's Drexel Burnham Lambert, who claimed 
Lewis was overcompensated and demanded tens of millions from his 
estate. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lewis smoothed the waters, settling a lawsuit with the  
former Drexel employees. 
</P>
<P>
	She started selling subsidiaries. Following the largest sales  
over the past two years, the company dropped to the fourth greatest 
revenue generator on the Black Enterprise listings. In 1998, the 
company had revenues of $322 million. 
</P>
<P>
	A few parts of the company remain to be sold. Those sales are  
expected by summer. 
</P>
<P>
	After that?  
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lewis won't talk about her plans although she said she  
wants to remain in business.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Advance; Dow Up60.54 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were rebounding today from Thursday's  
steep selloff as new economic data showing slower-than-expected 
growth helped calm fears about rising inflation and higher interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors also jumped at the chance to pick up shares at cheaper  
prices as a result of this week's turbulent slump on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon, the Dow Jones industrial average was up 60.54 at  
10,527.47. The blue-chip index rose as much as 120 points in 
morning trading. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the Dow plunged more than 235 points, or by 2.2  
percent, in its steepest one-day point drop since Sept. 30, 1998, 
when the Dow tumbled 237.20. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad-market indexes also rose today. After some weakness in  
early trading, the Nasdaq composite index, which has been battered 
recently by a steep decline in Internet stocks, was up 24.99 at 
2,444.14. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was light ahead of the three-day holiday weekend. U.S.  
financial markets will be closed Monday in observance of Memorial 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow has been seesawing all week with declines of more than 1  
percent on both Monday and Tuesday, then a rebound of more than 1 
percent on Wednesday before Thursday's slide. Heading into today's 
session, the average was down 362.35 points, or by 3.3 percent, for 
the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The volatile ride on Wall Street has been fueled by fears that  
any signs of rising inflation will prompt the Federal Reserve to 
raise interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating. 
Higher rates typically cut into profits as it becomes more 
expensive for companies to borrow money. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still are in a tug-of-war between those people who thing  
interest rates will go higher and those that don't,'' said Alan 
Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	But some of the fears about rising inflation and interest rates  
were tempered today after the Purchasing Management Association of 
Chicago reported a greater-than-expected drop in its business 
activity index. 
</P>
<P>
	That helped boost stocks, especially banks and financial  
services shares, which have been hurt by concerns over an 
interest-rate hike. Citigroup was up 1 13/16 at 65 1/4 and Merrill 
Lynch was up 1 3/16 at 84 3/16. 
</P>
<P>
	A flood of bargain-hunters entering the market today also helped  
lift stocks. Investors were looking to pick up stocks at much 
cheaper prices than they were just a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 3-to-2 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 310.86 million shares 
at midday, down from 350 million shares on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 14.99 at 1,296.40, the  
NYSE composite index was up 6.33 at 620.35, and the American Stock 
Exchange composite index was up 4.48 at 778.87.

<HEADLINE> Busy Hurricane Season Predicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Atlantic hurricane season is about to start,  
and federal officials say three weather phenomena will make it 
busier than usual. 
</P>
<P>
	The bracing outlook, which calls for three or more intense  
hurricanes instead of an average season's two, was issued Thursday 
by the National Weather Service, the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration, and the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, forecasters said, they expect more hurricanes in part  
because of La Nina, the opposite of El Nino. La Nina brings 
cooler-than-normal temperatures to the part of the Pacific Ocean 
off South America that sees warmer water temperatures during El 
Nino. 
</P>
<P>
	Also facilitating hurricane development will be low wind shear  
in parts of the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, and a wind 
pattern off west Africa that may feed developing storms. 
</P>
<P>
	People in hurricane-prone areas ought to start thinking about  
how they will handle the expected storms, and actively preparing 
for the chance of being in a storm's path, weather service director 
Jack Kelly cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the final analysis, even a perfect warning is an academic  
exercise if people don't get it or haven't thought about what they 
would do,'' Kelly said.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane Center, warned  
residents in areas that could be affected by hurricanes to heed any 
and all evacuation orders. 
</P>
<P>
	But he cautioned against fleeing when no evacuation order has  
been given, saying it would be safer to stay put in that situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``You tend to have too many people evacuate,'' Jarrell noted.  
``Trust me, there's not enough roads to get us all to Atlanta.''

<HEADLINE> Personal Income Rises 0.5 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Money is burning a hole in Americans' pockets.  
Once again, consumers in April spent nearly as much as they earned, 
helping to push the nation's savings rate to an all-time low. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending climbed 0.4 percent last month, a tad lower than the  
0.5 percent increase in Americans' personal income, the Commerce 
Department reported Friday. The income figure includes wages, 
interest and government benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't underestimate the hedonism of the American  
consumer,'' said economist Mark Zandi of Regional Financial 
Associates in West Chester, Pa. ``But consumers have good reason to 
be out there spending. They've got jobs, their incomes are rising, 
confidence is high and the stock market is booming.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year Americans are spending more than they earned.  
</P>
<P>
	Spending in March rose 0.5 percent, while income increased 0.3  
percent. In February, spending went up 0.8 percent and income 
climbed 0.5 percent. In January, the increase in spending matched 
the increase in income at 0.6 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	That trend dragged down the savings rate -- savings as a  
percentage of after-tax income -- to a record low of minus 0.7 
percent in April. Savings have now been in negative territory for 
five of the past six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers are trying to maintain their lavish spending habits by  
dipping into their savings once again, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers' spending spree helped keep the U.S. economy growing  
at a robust, 4.1 percent annual rate during the first three months 
of this year, despite economic turmoil elsewhere around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans are enjoying the lowest unemployment rate in nearly  
three decades, and high demand for labor -- even labor shortages in 
some regions and industries such as construction -- is helping to 
boost wages. In April, wages rose 0.6 percent, after increasing 0.2 
percent in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Continuing stock market gains and other profits also are lining  
many people's pockets. Interest and dividend income rose last 
month, along with rental incomes and business' owners incomes. 
</P>
<P>
	Even farm incomes, among the hardest hit by a record U.S. trade  
deficit resulting from economic hard times abroad, recovered 
somewhat in April, climbing 4.6 percent after a big slide the month 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	However, despite rising incomes, analysts said a recent increase  
in inflation, should it continue, could convince consumers to trim 
their spending. Consumer prices rose 0.7 percent in April, the most 
in nearly nine years, with gasoline prices jumping particularly 
sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I see ... is kind of really a tug of war between  
consumers trying to maintain their spending habits at the same time 
their income is being squeezed a little bit by rising inflation,'' 
said economist Sun Won Sohn of Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, if the stock market weren't as strong, consumers would be  
feeling more pinched. ``That would reduce people's accumulated 
savings and people would have to save the hard way -- by spending 
less,'' said economist Lynn Reaser of the Bank of America Private 
Bank in Jacksonville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	In April, spending on durable goods -- big-ticket items expected  
to last at least three years, such as washing machines and cars -- 
fell 0.8 percent. That was more than offset by a 0.4 percent rise 
in spending on nondurable products such as food and fuel, and a 0.7 
percent increase in purchases of services.

<HEADLINE> Casinos May Avoid New Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Casinos apparently will avoid any  
recommendation of new taxes or federal supervision in next month's 
report from a national gambling commission. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, which the National Gambling Impact Study Commission  
will finish next week during a meeting in San Francisco, will be 
released June 18. It probably will propose restrictions on state 
lotteries, criticize American Indian casinos for being secretive 
and discourage racetracks from installing slot machines. 
</P>
<P>
	But, so far, the working draft of the nine-member commission's  
report steers clear of the most spectacular symbols of legalized 
gambling: the hulking, showy, laser-lit, buffet-fed, up-all-night 
casino resorts of Atlantic City, N.J., Las Vegas and the 
Mississippi Gulf Coast, along with smaller casinos on land and 
rivers in seven other states. 
</P>
<P>
	The casino industry feared the commission would urge the federal  
government to take over gambling supervision from the states and 
impose new federal taxes on gambling. Neither idea has yet come to 
pass, and probably won't. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission also rejected proposals that would have forced  
casinos to stop issuing credit, to send profit and loss summaries 
to patrons and to impose daily loss limits on bettors. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the most objectionable part of the report is its call  
for an end to legalized betting on collegiate sports, said Frank 
Fahrenkopf Jr., a former Republican National Committee chairman who 
is head of the American Gaming Association, the industry lobby. 
</P>
<P>
	The commision, which also seems poised to recommend a national  
moratorium on new gambling ventures, includes three men who have 
been prominent in and around Las Vegas. But Fahrenkopf denies that 
the casino industry is getting kid-gloves treatment by the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were looked at harder'' than the other forms of gambling,  
he said. Fahrenkopf credited the industry with ``being out front'' 
on issues like helping addictive gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
	But others see politics at work.  
</P>
<P>
	When Congress created the commission in 1996, casino  
heavyweights lobbied congressional leaders and the White House to 
appoint members friendly to their industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The result: Of the nine commissioners, three have worked in and  
around Las Vegas casinos -- William Bible, former chairman of the 
Nevada gaming control board; MGM Grand Chairman J. Terrence Lanni, 
a member of the AGA's board of directors; and John Wilhelm, 
national president of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
	All three say they approached their work with open minds. But  
Bernard Horn, who has followed the commission for the National 
Coalition Against Legalized Gambling, said he believes they ``made 
it their priority to protect the Vegas casino industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James Dobson, the commission's most unyielding critic of  
gambling, agreed that the casino industry got results by making 
sure some of its friends were appointed. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Dobson said casinos also had a strong case on  
the merits. He believes casino resorts, to which people travel, are 
less worrisome than state lotteries, Internet betting and 
neighborhood slot machines that bring the temptation of gambling 
close to where people live. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea that people choose to travel to casinos was a point the  
casino lobby hammered home at every opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	Casino operators formed the AGA in 1994 after President Clinton  
broached the notion of a federal gaming tax. It now has about 120 
member companies, including casino hotels, riverboat casinos and 
casino suppliers.

<HEADLINE> Russian Official Shows Ambition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Nikolai Aksyonenko has been rattling a lot of  
nerves in Russia lately. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the tall, graying 50-year-old was the relatively  
obscure chief of Russia's railroad network. Then he was named one 
of two first deputy prime ministers -- the top positions in the 
government after prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the other first deputy has resigned and Aksyonenko's  
ambition has assumed stunning proportions. 
</P>
<P>
	He has brazenly assigned himself broad powers and said he would  
oversee all government policy -- baffling and outraging other 
Cabinet ministers. He even popped up unexpectedly at a key meeting 
at a Black Sea resort between President Boris Yeltsin and Prime 
Minister Sergei Stepashin. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the other first deputy prime minister, Mikhail  
Zadornov, was not among those complaining about Aksyonenko, he 
couldn't have been happy about his colleague's boasts. Zadornov 
resigned Friday, saying he had been frustrated in his quest to 
maintain his position as finance minister in addition to his new 
duties. 
</P>
<P>
	Aksyonenko is ``hogging the blanket'' and ``conducting himself  
like he's ... convinced of his hereditary right to rule the 
country,'' the daily Noviye Izvestia wrote Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Conductor, hit the brakes!'' the popular newspaper Moskovsky  
Komsomolets said in a headline Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Observers are wary of Aksyonenko's rapid rise and his boldness.  
But their concern stems largely from his alleged links to tycoons 
Boris Berezovsky and Roman Abramovich. Aksyonenko denies close 
connections to the men. 
</P>
<P>
	Both moguls are reported to wield immense influence over Yeltsin  
through his family, and to control some of Russia's most coveted 
businesses. For many Russians, they are also symbols of the ``crony 
capitalism'' that allowed several businessmen to use high-level 
contacts to buy government assets at giveaway prices and quickly 
amass fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian media have questioned Aksyonenko's recent incursions  
into the oil industry, one of Russia's most lucrative sectors. 
Abramovich heads Russian oil giant Sibneft, and Berezovsky is 
reputed to have oil holdings. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Aksyonenko chaired a meeting on the condition of the  
oil industry. The day before, he overshadowed new Fuel and Energy 
Minister Viktor Kalyuzhny's first public appearance, laying out 
plans for the oil, gas and coal sectors while Kalyuzhny meekly 
nodded in agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Aksyonenko's background lies in railroads, not oil. He graduated  
from the Novosibirsk Institute of Railways and worked his way up to 
head the Railways Ministry, which oversees the huge web of Russian 
railroads, one of the nation's giant state monopolies. 
</P>
<P>
	Aksyonenko has said little about his economic policies, though  
he has ordered the Cabinet to boost industrial output by 20 percent 
this year, Moskovsky Komsomolets reported. It was unclear how 
Russia's flailing industry was to achieve such an ambitious goal. 
</P>
<P>
	Some observers have said Yeltsin may be grooming Aksyonenko as a  
possible successor. 
</P>
<P>
	Others say the president is using Aksyonenko to check the powers  
of Stepashin, also touted as a potential presidential contender 
after his appointment as prime minister earlier this month. Yeltsin 
often plays his underlings off each other. 
</P>
<P>
	Resentment of Aksyonenko has been aggravated by confusion over  
who in the new government is in charge of what. 
</P>
<P>
	Aksyonenko dived into the vacuum Wednesday, announcing he would  
oversee the Cabinet's work in ``all fields.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``No one in the government, except Nikolai Aksyonenko, knows  
what his job is,'' the daily Segodnya wrote Friday.

<HEADLINE> Indicting Milosevic Was Easy Part </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Now comes the hard part.  
</P>
<P>
	After indicting President Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav war  
crimes tribunal still needs someone to arrest him and escort him to 
The Hague, no small task. 
</P>
<P>
	The tribunal has no police powers, meaning it is entirely  
dependent on the international community to arrest indicted war 
criminals. Since its creation six years ago, 25 of 84 suspects, 
Bosnians of various ethnicities, have been taken into custody in 
The Hague, Netherlands. 
</P>
<P>
	And none had the kind of security apparatus that Milosevic has  
to fend off any bid to apprehend him. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief prosecutor Louise Arbour announced Thursday that the  
tribunal had indicted Milosevic and four other top officials on 
charges of crimes against humanity in the brutal expulsion of 
750,000 ethnic Albanians from Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and British Foreign  
Secretary Robin Cook were asked about the possibility of 
Milosevic's apprehension, but neither offered hope, at least 
publicly, that any move to arrest Milosevic was afoot. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has to be turned over and we want to see him in The  
Hague,'' said Albright, speaking to reporters at a joint news 
conference with Canadian Foreign Secretary Lloyd Axworthy. Cook 
offered a similar response during a news conference in London. 
</P>
<P>
	Arbour suggested that Yugoslav authorities themselves request  
that Milosevic and four indicted subordinates surrender to the 
tribunal. Alternatively, they should ``provide for their arrest and 
transfer to The Hague,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright welcomed the indictment of Milosevic, noting that it  
broadens the base of opposition to Milosevic to include a tribunal 
created by the U.N. Security Council. The indictment proves that 
the hostility to Milosevic is no mere ``figment of the imagination 
of NATO,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zbigniew Brzezinski, a former White House national security  
adviser, said the capture of Milosevic would require nothing less 
than ``the occupation of Serbia and the seizure of Belgrade.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing with a group of other Balkan experts, Brzezinski said  
the apprehension of Milosevic should not be a high priority. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real importance of the indictment is that it reinforces  
the international condemnation of an outlaw regime and thus gives 
... political as well as moral sanction to what is being pursued,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Top Russian officials suggested the indictment could complicate  
the Yugoslav peace process -- one in which Russian diplomats are 
deeply involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the legally elected president of Yugoslavia.  
Attempting to solve the situation in the Balkans, if you're dealing 
with Yugoslavia you have to deal with one person, the president of 
Yugoslavia,'' said presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Col. Terry Taylor of the London-based International  
Institute for Strategic Studies: ``The primary goal must be to get 
the people back in their homes. It's not that the law isn't 
important, but one must keep one's eyes on the primary goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Joseph Biden, D-Del., saw the indictment of Milosevic as a  
mixed blessing. It may well complicate future negotiations, he 
said, but '' I believe it is important because it makes absolutely 
clear that the United Nations, NATO and the rest of the civilized 
world know what Milosevic has been doing and will not tolerate it 
longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said former Rep. Stephen Solarz, D-N.Y., who, like Brzezinski,  
is affiliated with the Balkan Action Council, ``It is neither 
possible nor appropriate to negotiate with an indicted war 
criminal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin disputed that notion,  
pointing out that Russian special envoy Viktor Chernomyrdin plans 
to meet with Milosevic in Belgrade on Friday to review peace 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Irrespective of the indictment, Rubin said the administration  
believes ``it would not be a difficult proposition to have the 
acceptance of NATO's conditions implemented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairman Jesse Helms  
cautioned against any deal with Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Negotiate with Milosevic?'' he asked. ``Never. He must be  
removed from power now.''

<HEADLINE> Police Sniper Kills Wash. Gunman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHORELINE, Wash. (AP) -- A man fleeing a hit-and-run freeway  
accident Friday ran into a neighborhood where he killed one woman 
and broke another's neck before barricading himself in a house. He 
was shot dead by a police sniper hours later, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the gunman also was connected to the slayings of his  
mother and 2-year-old nephew in the nearby town of Brier. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman, in his early 20s, was found dead at about 8:45 p.m.,  
eight hours after the standoff began, King County Sheriff Dave 
Reichert said. Police said he was killed at 5:30 p.m., but they 
didn't enter the house until after a robot found him unresponsive. 
</P>
<P>
	The names of the gunman and his victims were not released.  
</P>
<P>
	Police were called to the area in suburban Seattle by a neighbor  
who heard a woman scream. When officers arrived, a man holed up in 
a house began firing. 
</P>
<P>
	Two women, both in their 60s, were assaulted outside a home,  
possibly with a garden tool, police said. One was bludgeoned to 
death, and the other was in critical condition with a broken neck. 
</P>
<P>
	SWAT teams converged on the scene and helped evacuate nearby  
homes. Students in a nearby elementary school were ordered to stay 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
	The gunman entered a second house -- apparently chosen at random  
-- that contained a large number of weapons and the man fired dozens 
of shots before he died, officers said. Reichert said his officers 
responded with just one sniper's shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sad thing and it's a tough decision to make,'' Reichert  
said. ``But in this case it was the right thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One neighborhood resident, John Berger, said the gunman had  
walked into his house through an open door and sat down to watch 
TV. He said the ``crazy-eyed'' stranger ``kept saying he had lost 
his way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berger and his roommate said they chased the man away with a  
baseball bat. The man walked on down the street, checking for other 
open doors. 
</P>
<P>
	Brier Police Chief Gary Minor said the gunman had been living  
with his mother for four months. He offered no motive for the 
slaying of the mother and 2-year-old boy. Neighbors reported no 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Minor would not say how they were killed, other than to say they  
were not shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a matter of a child dying, this is about the worst case  
I've seen,'' Minor said. 
</P>
<P>
	A deputy was in serious condition with a fractured skull and  
cuts on her face apparently suffered when a bullet struck her 
vehicle, a hospital spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses told police they saw the gunman jump out of his car  
and run into the neighborhood after his car struck Anthony Venegas' 
motorcycle on Interstate 5 and caught fire. Venegas, 64, lost his 
left leg in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident and standoff forced police to close I-5 in both  
directions at the start of the evening rush hour for the holiday 
weekend.

<HEADLINE>  Shooting Victims' Kin Clash on Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two parents who share grief over their  
children's murders at the hands of classmates disagree on whether 
the shooters, guns or lawmakers themselves are to blame for their 
tragedies. 
</P>
<P>
	The April 20 murder of Columbine High School student Rachel Joy  
Scott, 17, should be blamed solely on Eric Harris and Dylan 
Klebold, her father says. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are people behind those instruments of death,'' Darrell  
Scott told the House Judiciary subcommittee on crime during a 
hearing Thursday. ``I do believe Eric and Dylan bear primary 
responsibility for my daughter's death, not the guns themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Byrl Phillips-Taylor of Richmond, Va., blamed an AK-47 for  
her son's 1989 death at the hands of a ``classmate with a grudge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The easy availability of guns got my baby killed,''  
Phillips-Taylor told the panel, urging lawmakers to pass the 
mandatory background checks for gun show transactions and other new 
firearms restrictions voted by the Senate last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Senate has demonstrated that it cares about keeping guns  
away from children,'' she said. ``And that may be the turning point 
that every mother like me has been waiting for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Republican leaders this week said they support the concept  
of the gun restrictions passed by the Senate, but they rejected 
demands from Democrats to rubber-stamp the measures this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who has  
co-authored gun control bills in the past, said careful 
consideration of the legislation next month would ensure that new 
controls would not infringe on the Second Amendment right to bear 
arms. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans at the hearing Thursday criticized the Clinton  
administration for failing to prosecute violators of existing 
firearms laws while pushing for more gun restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., suggested that if the Ten Commandments had  
been posted at high schools where the shootings occurred, ``we 
would not have had the tragedies that bring us here today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Replied Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder Jr.: ``If the young  
people and adult criminals who committed these crimes had a tougher 
time getting their hands on guns, these horrible crimes might have 
been prevented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, who broke a 50-50 Senate tie last week  
in favor of the new gun show restrictions, returned to the Capitol 
to accuse House Republicans of trying to please the National Rifle 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this very moment, there are some of the other side meeting  
behind closed doors plotting to have more delays in order to 
preserve loopholes'' in firearms laws, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre told the House  
subcommittee that the Senate bill was a ``red tape nightmare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically it would extend the reaches of the federal  
government into the homes of this country,'' LaPierre said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the NRA supports mandatory gun show background checks  
and other concepts in the Senate bill, but not as it is written. 
For example, he said, the Senate would consider ``your uncle's 
skeet-shooting range'' a gun show subject to government regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott, testifying at the request of committee Republicans,  
supported LaPierre's complaint that some gun control advocates were 
seeking to put the blame for the shootings at the NRA's doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe that they are responsible for my daughter's  
death,'' said Scott, who said he was not a member of the group and 
does not own a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott also scolded lawmakers about their eagerness to pass more  
laws despite the cultural causes behind school shootings. 
``Political posturing and restrictive legislation are not the 
answers,'' he said.

<HEADLINE>  Cuban Foreign Minister Replaced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, long  
considered a possible successor to President Fidel Castro, has been 
replaced by Castro's 34-year-old chief of staff, Felipe Perez 
Roque, the government announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear what the move meant, and it was not  
immediately announced what new role Robaina would assume. 
</P>
<P>
	A brief story on the front page of the Communist Party daily  
Granma said that Robaina ``who made the greatest efforts to 
complete his job during the time he was in charge, is freed from 
his position until a new function is assigned to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The note said that Castro proposed Perez Roque for the job and  
that it was approved by the Council of State, comprised of the 
country's most powerful and trusted government officials, as well 
as by the top leadership of the Communist Party of Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Appointed foreign minister in 1993, Robaina has overseen the  
communist country's foreign policy during years of extreme economic 
hardship following the collapse of the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Through his almost constant travels around the world, Robaina  
has been credited with helping Cuba expand and strengthen its ties 
with many nations following the lose of its communist allies. 
</P>
<P>
	Felipe Perez Roque is a deputy with the National Assembly,  
Cuba's unicameral legislature, and a member of the Council of 
State. He also belongs to the party's Central Committee, the 
party's directorate. 
</P>
<P>
	Robaina was just 37 and head of the party's Union of Communist  
Youth when he was appointed to the post. He had no foreign 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement does not necessarily mean that Robaina is being  
moved aside. Robaina's predecessor, Ricardo Alarcon, went on to 
become president of the National Assembly and continues to play an 
important role in both domestic and foreign policy, especially with 
the United States.

<HEADLINE> FBI Asked To Probe S.C. Dragging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KINGSTREE, S.C. (AP) -- A black man who was dragged by two white  
men for a quarter-mile beside their pickup truck said he's not sure 
the attack had anything to do with his race. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could have been mistaken identity,'' Charone Green, who was  
not seriously injured in the dragging early Wednesday, told The 
(Columbia) State for today's editions. ``It could have been 
anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eric W. Jones, 38, of Gastonia, N.C., and Arthur Marshall, 34,  
of Georgetown were formally charged today with assault and battery 
with intent to kill. Marshall also was charged with possession of a 
stolen vehicle. Bond was set at $200,000 for Jones and $212,000 for 
Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
	Williamsburg County Sheriff Kelvin Washington has asked the FBI  
and State Law Enforcement Division to look into whether Green's 
civil rights were violated in the dragging. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the sheriff said authorities have no indication at this  
point that Green was attacked because he is black. ``There is a 
possibility that it may be drug-related,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said Green was grabbed and dragged when he  
approached a pickup truck that had slowed in front of his cousin's 
house on a rural road in the Bloomingvale community, about 90 miles 
east of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Green, 23, told investigators he was standing at the end of a  
driveway when two men pulled up in a red pickup truck and told him 
to come over. Green said he had a napkin in his hand that the men 
might have thought contained drugs. He said he did not have drugs 
on him. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the passenger grabbed his arm and the truck drove off,  
Chief Deputy Dwight Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first thing that came to my mind is, `If I don't hold on  
to this truck, I'm going to wind up getting killed,''' Green told 
the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Green said he did not remember much about what the men said as  
he clung to the side of the truck. 
</P>
<P>
	A cousin who witnessed it said Green broke free when the truck  
hit a culvert. 
</P>
<P>
	Green's right leg, ankle and arm were injured in the attack,  
according to a sheriff's report. He was treated at a hospital and

	Green's grandmother, Mary Green, said last June's dragging death  
of a black man in Texas was the first thing that popped in her mind 
she heard what happened. One man has been convicted of murder and 
sentenced to death in that case, while trials are pending for two 
more.

	But she said she wasn't sure the attack on her grandson was  
similarly motivated.

	``I can't say whether it's a racial thing or not,'' she said.

	Investigators were unsure who was driving the truck that was  
reported stolen from Lexington County, near Columbia. It was found 
with flattened tires and a shattered windshield, its radio missing, 
Washington said. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspects were arrested at a home near Andrews, where  
Marshall has relatives. Washington wouldn't say what led 
investigators to them.

	Milosevic Stands Ground in Talks  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO jets are hitting Yugoslavia's  
power supply system early Saturday, just hours after Yugoslav 
President Slobodan Milosevic emerged from talks with a Russian 
envoy. Milosevic maintains his refusal to allow an armed, 
international security force in Kosovo. Despite that, Russian envoy 
Viktor Chernomyrdin said he was ``very satisfied'' with the 
meeting. Strobe Talbott, the deputy U.S. secretary of state, said 
Chernomyrdin was not negotiating on behalf of NATO nor was he 
acting as a mediator.

	Albanian Army Stages War Games  
</P>
<P>
	KUKES, Albania (AP) -- The Albanian army Friday simulated a  
defense of its territory against a cross-border strike by Serbian 
forces, firing hundreds of artillery shells and rockets toward the 
embattled Kosovo frontier. The war games involved tanks, howitzers 
and 1,200 ground troops maneuvering several miles from the border, 
where Serbian forces have clashed with guerrillas of the Kosovo 
Liberation Army in recent days. NATO tried unsuccessfully to stop 
the exercise, fearing a Serbian military response in an area packed 
with more than 100,000 Kosovo refugees and international aid agency 
personnel.

	Judge Won't Release Colo. Autopsies  
</P>
<P>
	GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- The autopsy reports of the Columbine High  
School shooting victims will not be released, a judge said Friday, 
as they would cause substantial harm to the community of Littleton. 
Families of the victims asked the judge to seal the records after 
19 news organizations requested the records. The Denver Post and 
Denver Rocky Mountain challenged the families' request, saying the 
autopsy reports might shed light on the attack and help prevent 
further tragedies. But Jefferson County District Court Judge Henry 
Nieto said the community was traumatized by the shootings, and 
release of the reports would reopen wounds that are just beginning 
to heal.

	DRAS, India (AP) -- An Indian helicopter gunship was blasted from  
the skies above Kashmir's jagged Himalayan peaks Friday as the 
military pressed ahead with airstrikes to dislodge Islamic 
militants it says are backed by neighboring Pakistan. Despite the 
escalation in the military conflict, the political leadership in 
the two nuclear-armed nations appeared to be tempering their 
reactions, and India said it now believes Pakistan's military -- not 
its government -- is to blame for the latest fighting.

	Kaczynski's Bid For New Trial Nixed  
</P>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A federal judge has rejected Theodore  
Kaczynski's bid for a trial, turning aside the Unabomber's 
contention that he was forced into pleading guilty. U.S. District 
Judge Garland E. Burrell Jr. said Friday that Kaczynski's claims 
did not warrant a hearing and he dismissed the matter. Kaczynski 
pleaded guilty in January 1998 to bombings that killed three people 
and injured 23. He was sentenced to life in prison without the 
possibility of parole. The former math professor argued in recent 
filings that he was forced to either plead guilty or be portrayed 
at a trial as mentally ill by his attorneys, which he did not want.

	JFK's Casket Was Dropped in Ocean

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bronze casket used to transport President  
Kennedy's body from Dallas to Washington was dropped from a 
military plane into the ocean two years after he was killed, 
according to assassination documents. Kermit L. Hall, a member of 
the now-defunct Assassination Records Review Board, said Friday 
that documents to be released Tuesday by the National Archives show 
that the casket was flown several miles off the Maryland-Delaware 
coast in early 1965 and dumped in an area where the military 
discards unstable and outdated weapons and ammunition. The reasons 
for the disposal aren't clear, but it fuels speculation among 
assassination researchers that it was discarded to hide foul play.

<HEADLINE>  Shooting Victims' Kin Clash on Guns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two parents who share grief over their  
children's murders at the hands of classmates disagree on whether 
the shooters, guns or lawmakers themselves are to blame for their 
tragedies. 
</P>
<P>
	The April 20 murder of Columbine High School student Rachel Joy  
Scott, 17, should be blamed solely on Eric Harris and Dylan 
Klebold, her father says. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are people behind those instruments of death,'' Darrell  
Scott told the House Judiciary subcommittee on crime during a 
hearing Thursday. ``I do believe Eric and Dylan bear primary 
responsibility for my daughter's death, not the guns themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Byrl Phillips-Taylor of Richmond, Va., blamed an AK-47 for  
her son's 1989 death at the hands of a ``classmate with a grudge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The easy availability of guns got my baby killed,''  
Phillips-Taylor told the panel, urging lawmakers to pass the 
mandatory background checks for gun show transactions and other new 
firearms restrictions voted by the Senate last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Senate has demonstrated that it cares about keeping guns  
away from children,'' she said. ``And that may be the turning point 
that every mother like me has been waiting for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	House Republican leaders this week said they support the concept  
of the gun restrictions passed by the Senate, but they rejected 
demands from Democrats to rubber-stamp the measures this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who has  
co-authored gun control bills in the past, said careful 
consideration of the legislation next month would ensure that new 
controls would not infringe on the Second Amendment right to bear 
arms. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans at the hearing Thursday criticized the Clinton  
administration for failing to prosecute violators of existing 
firearms laws while pushing for more gun restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., suggested that if the Ten Commandments had  
been posted at high schools where the shootings occurred, ``we 
would not have had the tragedies that bring us here today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Replied Deputy Attorney General Eric Holder Jr.: ``If the young  
people and adult criminals who committed these crimes had a tougher 
time getting their hands on guns, these horrible crimes might have 
been prevented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore, who broke a 50-50 Senate tie last week  
in favor of the new gun show restrictions, returned to the Capitol 
to accuse House Republicans of trying to please the National Rifle 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``At this very moment, there are some of the other side meeting  
behind closed doors plotting to have more delays in order to 
preserve loopholes'' in firearms laws, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	NRA Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre told the House  
subcommittee that the Senate bill was a ``red tape nightmare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically it would extend the reaches of the federal  
government into the homes of this country,'' LaPierre said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the NRA supports mandatory gun show background checks  
and other concepts in the Senate bill, but not as it is written. 
For example, he said, the Senate would consider ``your uncle's 
skeet-shooting range'' a gun show subject to government regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott, testifying at the request of committee Republicans,  
supported LaPierre's complaint that some gun control advocates were 
seeking to put the blame for the shootings at the NRA's doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't believe that they are responsible for my daughter's  
death,'' said Scott, who said he was not a member of the group and 
does not own a gun. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott also scolded lawmakers about their eagerness to pass more  
laws despite the cultural causes behind school shootings. 
``Political posturing and restrictive legislation are not the 
answers,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The hardiest and most infamous of Times Square's  
sex shops has been shut down by the city. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities closed down Show World on Thursday, saying it housed  
a fencing operation dealing in expensive electronic equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Show World offers video peep shows and sells X-rated videos.  
</P>
<P>
	The shop's lawyer said the alleged fencing ring involved one man  
who was leasing space from Show World. 
</P>
<P>
	``The city took this isolated incident and capitalized, closing  
it this way when they couldn't close it legitimately,'' Herald 
Price Fahringer said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he will go to court Wednesday to contest the closing:  
``We have every expectation that we'll be able to reopen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The city arrested eight suspects in the fencing operation and  
shut Show World down under its ordinance against nuisances.

<HEADLINE> Two Charged With Swindling NBA Teams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Two men tried to profit from the plight of  
cancer-stricken WNBA guard Kim Perrot by soliciting autographed NBA 
memorabilia for bogus silent auctions on her behalf, FBI officials 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents arrested Gene Lessley Price, 42, of Houston and Moses  
Mays Jr., 46, of neighboring Missouri City early Friday morning. 
The two are each charged with one count of conspiracy and three 
counts of wire fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	``Really, scam artists is what they were, taking advantage of  
Kim Perrot's very, very unfortunate circumstance,'' said Don K. 
Clark, special agent-in-charge of the Houston FBI office. 
</P>
<P>
	Perrot, point guard for the two-time WNBA champion Houston  
Comets, announced Feb. 22 that an uncommon form of lung cancer had 
spread to her brain. She first underwent surgery and radiation 
treatments for the brain tumors and is preparing for chemotherapy 
for her lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	Perrot was at a Comets practice Friday morning, but did not  
speak to reporters. The club declined to comment about the arrests. 
</P>
<P>
	According to an indictment, Mays and Price asked for items from  
several NBA teams to be bid upon at two silent auctions last March 
at a pair of upscale Houston hotels. Clark said the auctions never 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
	However, after the purported auction dates, the two continued to  
tell NBA teams that bids had been taken and their company needed 
autographed items to pass on to donors. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors allege that the men received a team-autographed  
basketball from the Charlotte Hornets and balls signed by former 
Detroit Pistons star Isiah Thomas and current Piston Grant Hill. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the indictment says the defendants received jerseys signed  
by Miami Heat guard Tim Hardaway, Minnesota Timberwolves forward 
Kevin Garnett and Portland Trail Blazers Rasheed Wallace and Damon 
Stoudamire. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the memorabilia was recovered by authorities, Clark  
said, adding that the defendants also might have drummed up non-NBA 
donations for the supposed auctions, including vacation packages. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Clark did not say whether Mays and Price monetarily  
profited from their plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA and its teams were asked by the FBI not to discuss the  
case, officials said, though league security chief Horace Balmer 
issued a statement through authorities: 
</P>
<P>
	``Our teams and our players take pride in actively participating  
in charitable efforts and giving back to the community whenever 
possible, and it is extremely unfortunate if there are people who 
would try and take advantage of that situation through personal 
gain,'' Balmer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark credited the NBA with tipping off authorities about Mays  
and Price. 
</P>
<P>
	Each of the counts against carries a maximum five-year sentence  
if the men are convicted.

<HEADLINE> Columbine Families Try To Move On </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Michael Shoels still cries before he  
goes to bed at night. Kacey Brackney has stopped looking for 
friends who are no longer alive. Vickie DeHoff just took up ironing 
again. 
</P>
<P>
	Life is moving on, slowly, for the students and the families of  
those touched by the Columbine High School massacre. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's up and down,'' said Shoels, who lost his son, Isaiah, in  
the shooting. ``I'm not going to say I'm not hurting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vickie DeHoff, whose sophomore daughter Krysti was one of the  
last students rescued, is trying to get life back on track. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last night, I laughed for the first time. Today, I'm doing the  
ironing for the first time since the shooting,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	For her 16-year-old daughter, the trauma has persisted. Her  
mother said Miss DeHoff sat in a car for hours and could not easily 
go back to classes at a nearby high school after the April 20 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's never over. It never will be over,'' the teen said.  
</P>
<P>
	Miss Brackney, a 15-year-old freshman, said there are times when  
the horror of the massacre unexpectedly assails her. 
</P>
<P>
	``One month ago, I was wondering where my friend was. It's hard,  
but it's getting better,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The lives of all four were turned upside down when students Eric  
Harris and Dylan Klebold stormed Columbine with guns and bombs, 
fatally shooting 12 students and a teacher before killing 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	As the Columbine students marked the one-month anniversary,  
another school shooting in Conyers, Ga., reopened their wounds. The 
May 20 attack at Heritage High School injured six students. 
</P>
<P>
	``How could someone see all the tears and emotion and try to  
copycat this?'' asked freshman Katie Crona, 14. ``I'm angry someone 
else had to go through the same experience we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. DeHoff, who teaches a community college sociology course on  
death and dying, believes the grieving process has been even more 
difficult for the families of the gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at the pain of those whose children were injured or  
killed. Then look at the pain of those whose kids did this and 
multiply that. Their pain is so much greater than ours,'' she said. 
``I know the Klebolds. They raised Dylan well. They're not to 
blame. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're suffering from disenfranchised grief. Their loss can't  
be openly acknowledged, socially sanctioned or publicly shared.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pam Russell, a spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office, said the  
Klebolds have talked with investigators, but the Harrises have 
refused to cooperate without a grant of immunity. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Mark Stebnicki, a counselor who helped after the March 1998  
school shooting in Jonesboro, Ark., that killed five people, said 
it could take months or years for families of some victims to 
recover. 
</P>
<P>
	``For the trauma of an event like having your child (killed),  
there's no bouncing back,'' Stebnicki said. ``It will never be the 
same. They have to learn how to cope and how to adjust.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the families of those responsible, ``there is a feeling they  
have no right to grieve,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. DeHoff, who has known the Klebolds for 15 years, said she  
has received a number of letters expressing support for them. 
Typical was a letter from a California couple, who wrote that they 
had had troubles raising their own son, who turned out fine in the 
end. They asked Mrs. DeHoff to convey their message to the 
Klebolds. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not blame or judge you because as parents of a son, we  
know that you trust your kids,'' they wrote. ``The point is that 
you don't have a second chance and by the grace of God, we did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa Simon, a spokeswoman for the law firm representing the  
Klebolds, said they have received hundreds of similar letters. She 
said the Klebolds are still in the Denver area. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. DeHoff said forgiving the parents of the two killers  
``doesn't sit well with the parents of some of the victims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping our community is big enough to wrap our arms around  
those parents, too, because they also lost sons,'' she said. ``I 
don't hate the boys and I don't hate their parents. I hate that it 
happened.'' But Shoels said he cannot forgive the parents of the 
gunmen. On Thursday, he filed a $250 million negligence lawsuit 
against them. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not about money, this is about change. This money will  
be used properly for my son and others,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Funds Have a Lot To Boast About </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There is a simple reason why so many people have  
picked stock mutual funds for the job of managing their money: The 
funds have an impressive resume. 
</P>
<P>
	We're not talking here about a flash-in-the-pan showing over the  
last quarter by some individual fund riding a hot streak. Things 
like that happen all the time without proving much. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, we're looking at the record achieved by growth stock  
funds as a group over a truly long-term stretch -- the past 35 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	From the start of 1964 through the end of 1998, reports the  
research firm of Wiesenberger in Rockville, Md., the Wiesenberger 
Growth Mutual Fund Index posted an average annual return of 12.97 
percent, doubling investors' money every five and a half years or 
so. 
</P>
<P>
	Over that span of almost two generations, the growth fund index  
bested both the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock composite index, which 
averaged a 12.21 percent annual gain, and the Dow Jones industrial 
average, which averaged an 11.70 percent annual gain. 
</P>
<P>
	Growth funds also outperformed single-family houses, Treasury  
bonds and bills, gold and silver, farmland, the Swiss franc and 
U.S. savings bonds. They trounced inflation, which averaged 4.88 
percent a year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The average growth mutual fund outperformed all alternative  
investments reviewed over the past 35 years,'' points out David 
Chase in the just-published 1999 edition of Wiesenberger's 
Investment Performance Digest. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the mighty bull market on Wall Street had a lot to do  
with the growth funds' outstanding showing. Even the most ardent 
fan of the funds would acknowledge that 13 percent a year for 35 
years is a lot to expect from any investment, and the future 
probably won't be so bounteous. 
</P>
<P>
	But the last 35 years weren't just a one-way ride on the success  
express. Bear markets, some of them quite severe, struck stocks in 
1969-70, 1973-74, 1981-82 and 1990. Then there was the Crash of 
1987, which compressed a bear market-sized decline of more than 30 
percent into three months. 
</P>
<P>
	If you bought stock mutual funds in the 1960s, you had to ride  
out a very disappointing decade in the 1970s, when it looked as 
though chronic inflation was wrecking the stock market. Then, in 
the '80s and '90s, you had to resist the ever-present temptation to 
cash out your gains, amid constant cries that stocks had climbed to 
unsustainable heights. 
</P>
<P>
	In truth, very few people owned stock funds all through the last  
35 years. In the early '60s, there was only about $20 billion 
invested in all types of mutual funds, compared with more than $5.5 
trillion today. 
</P>
<P>
	Even among those investors who were aboard in the early years,  
many didn't stay. According to Investment Company Institute 
figures, the number of shareholder accounts in long-term funds 
shrank by more than 3 million in the lean years, from 10.33 million 
in 1973 to 7.17 million in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	In any case, something like three-quarters, conservatively  
estimated, of all of today's fund accounts weren't opened until the 
'90s. 
</P>
<P>
	Skeptics on the funds, and there are still many of them, seize  
on these numbers to say that the funds' record is largely illusory. 
The spectacular gain of the past 35 years, they say, was achieved 
starting from a low base, with only a handful of funds owning a 
small piece of the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	As more and more people got into the game, the funds' task got  
harder. If in the beginning the funds enjoyed all the speed and 
maneuverability of a sports car, today they more closely resemble a 
bus -- and a heavily loaded bus at that. 
</P>
<P>
	Points taken. But commentators have been describing the  
theoretical limitations of funds ever since the 1960s. And through 
the past 35 years, the average stock fund, by Wiesenberger's 
reckoning, has somehow contrived to outdistance the Dow, outstrip 
the S&AMP;P 500, and achieve an outstanding investment return. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a debatable question whether stock funds will beat the  
averages and provide a good payoff in the future. But if the issue 
is whether they CAN do these things, well, the record of the last 
three and a half decades is there to speak for itself.

	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Novelist Alice Adams, widely admired for  
her artfully constructed stories, died Thursday. She was 72. 
</P>
<P>
	She had been treated for heart problems earlier in the week and  
appeared to have died in her sleep, said her editor, Victoria 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Adams' 10 novels and five collections of short stories about  
women's lives sometimes reflected or anticipated changes in 
society. 
</P>
<P>
	After publishing her first story for The New Yorker in 1969, Ms.  
Adams became one of the magazine's most distinctive voices. 
</P>
<P>
	Her 1975 novel ``Families and Survivors,'' about a woman who  
moves from the South to San Francisco, established her as an 
important literary presence. ``Superior Women,'' which traced the 
lives of five Radcliffe women, in 1984 became a best seller. 
</P>
<P>
	Known for her wry perspective on life, Ms. Adams once ruminated  
on the difficulty of writing as one ages: ``Some smart person once 
said that what happens is your critical standards rise, and your 
talent does not necessarily increase in a commensurate way.''

<HEADLINE> FDA OKs Arthritis Drug for Children </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some of the 50,000 American children who  
suffer debilitating rheumatoid arthritis won a potent new treatment 
Friday, the genetically engineered drug Enbrel. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors welcomed the much-needed therapy but warned that it  
should be reserved for children with moderate to severe arthritis 
who have failed standard therapy. That's because Enbrel comes with 
a safety question: Will it pose a serious risk of infection? 
</P>
<P>
	``It is somewhat concerning,'' acknowledged Dr. William  
Schwieterman of the Food and Drug Administration, which approved 
Enbrel for children but ordered its maker to continue monitoring 
that question. 
</P>
<P>
	But Schwieterman called Enbrel ``very good news'' for children  
who have had few options. ``It's very clear Enbrel is likely to 
provide a substantial number of them benefit,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Immunex Corp. began selling Enbrel for adult rheumatoid  
arthritis last winter. It attacks the disease in a way no other 
medicine does, soaking up an immune system protein called tumor 
necrosis factor that causes much of rheumatoid's inflammation 
before the substance can reach joints to damage them. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors who treat juvenile rheumatoid arthritis immediately  
clamored to know if Enbrel would help arthritis' smallest 
sufferers, too. 
</P>
<P>
	The FDA approved Enbrel for children based on a study of 69  
moderate to severe patients ages 4 to 17 who failed standard 
treatment. Enbrel helped 74 percent of them improve. 
</P>
<P>
	Katie Emmerson of West Covina, Calif., moved from a wheelchair  
to the school swimming team after joining the Enbrel study 1 1/2 years 
ago. Initially, almost every joint was swollen and painful. She had 
failed all other therapies and was suffering severe side effects 
from painkillers. 
</P>
<P>
	``She hadn't been able to close her hand in two years, and she  
made a fist'' 48 hours after her first Enbrel injection, mother 
Patti Emmerson said. ``I'll never forget. ... She said, 'Mom, I 
feel so good.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Katie, 15, requires no other medication.  
</P>
<P>
	But the worry is that by inhibiting the immune system, Enbrel  
could cause infections. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, the FDA revealed that 30 of an estimated 25,000  
adult Enbrel users have developed serious infections, and six have 
died. The FDA ordered Immunex to study whether the drug is to 
blame. Meanwhile, doctors were warned not to give Enbrel to any 
adults with active or chronic infections, and to be cautious in 
prescribing it to people with diseases like diabetes that increase 
infection risk. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty-two percent of children studied suffered some infection,  
but all were mild cases, the FDA said. There's no way to tell if 
those were just routine childhood infections, but FDA said 
pediatricians should heed Enbrel's warnings and ordered Immunex to 
report how all child users fare. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kids do get infections multiple times during a year,''  
cautioned Dr. Steven Abramson of the Hospital for Joint Diseases, 
an expert on juvenile rheumatoid arthritis for the Arthritis 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	But until doctors learn more about the potential risk, Abramson  
urged that only children with serious disease who aren't helped by 
other treatments try Enbrel. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is perhaps the most effective drug doctors have seen'' in  
years, so they may want to use it widely, Abramson said. ``I would 
still err on the side of being very conservative.''

<HEADLINE> White Sands Horses Leave for S.D. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE SANDS MISSILE RANGE, N.M. (AP) -- About three dozen wild  
horses left their drought-prone New Mexico home for greener 
pastures, beginning a new life today on a ranch far away. 
</P>
<P>
	Clambering aboard aluminum trailers Thursday, the animals, among  
the last of the White Sands wild horses, began a 21-hour journey to 
a private ranch in South Dakota -- where they will retain their 
freedom among rolling hills, towering pine trees and an abundance 
of fresh water. 
</P>
<P>
	The herd arrived this morning and were unloaded into a corral.  
They will stay there a week or two to adjust to the new 
surroundings, then they will be turned loose on the ranch, said 
Jeff Krolikowski, son-in-law of ranch owner Alan Amiotte. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a happy ending for these horses,'' said Karen Sussman,  
whose Scottsdale, Ariz.-based International Society for the 
Protection of Mustangs and Burros helped with the move. ``These 
horses are going to heaven, and I mean heaven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trip to the 10,000-acre ranch 85 miles east of Rapid City  
ends a saga of a herd once numbering 1,800 horses. They had roamed 
free long before the ranchland became the White Sands Missile 
Range, an Army weapons range, in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm really happy to do this so the horses have a home,''  
rancher Amiotte said earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever since 122 horses died during a drought five years ago in  
southern New Mexico, the military and an animal protection group 
have been trying to find the horses new homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Adoptions whittled the population down to about 80 horses this  
spring. Last month, 35 horses were taken to Amiotte's ranch and on 
Thursday, 26 studs, seven mares and two foals were carted off. Some 
were so skinny their ribs could be counted. 
</P>
<P>
	As many as 10 horses remain on the 3,000-square-mile desert  
range. If any mares are found -- there are believed to be three or 
fewer -- they too will be sent to South Dakota. Any studs will live 
out their lives at White Sands. 
</P>
<P>
	The animals are among an estimated 20,000 wild horses roaming  
free in Nevada, California, Oregon, Idaho, Montana, Wyoming, Utah, 
Arizona, Colorado and New Mexico, Sussman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Although fear for their survival was what prompted the rescue  
effort, there was another reason for hastening their departure. 
</P>
<P>
	Because water is scarce in the desert conditions, the horses  
would tear up the banks of the few watering holes, dumping sediment 
into the water and potentially harming the White Sands pupfish, a 
species on the state's endangered list, said Patrick Morrow, a 
wildlife biologist. 
</P>
<P>
	``The environment doesn't have the ability to support the  
animals,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	White Sands Missile Range officials were relieved, if a little  
heavy-hearted, over the horses' departure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm glad that we came up with a solution and the horses have  
found a place to go that will keep them together,'' spokesman Larry 
Furrow said. ``But as most people on the range, I'm a little sad to 
see them go.''

<HEADLINE> Judge Won't Release Colo. Autopsies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- A judge on Friday refused to release  
autopsy reports on victims of the Columbine High School shootings, 
saying it would cause substantial harm to the community. 
</P>
<P>
	Families of the victims asked the judge to seal the records  
after 19 news organizations requested the records. The Denver Post 
and Denver Rocky Mountain challenged the families' request, saying 
the autopsy reports might shed light on the attack and help prevent 
further tragedies. 
</P>
<P>
	But Jefferson County District Court Judge Henry Nieto said the  
community was traumatized by the shootings, and release of the 
reports would reopen wounds that are just beginning to heal. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like every member of this community has lost a child,''  
Nieto said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two students, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, charged into  
Columbine High School at lunchtime April 20, killing 12 of their 
classmates and a teacher before killing themselves. 
</P>

	Family members wept as Nieto announced his decision. Attorneys  
for the two newspapers said they have not decided whether to 
appeal.

	Meanwhile, authorities pulled down the crime scene tape around  
the school on Friday, as school officials prepared to allow 
students into classrooms next week to pick up books and backpacks 
left behind as students fled the carnage.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Calls Caldera Claim Bogus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Neither consumers nor personal computer  
makers were hurt by Microsoft's licensing practices for the MS-DOS 
operating system in the early 1990s, a Microsoft attorney argued. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Klapper said Thursday that the contention by Caldera  
Inc. of Orem, Utah, that Microsoft deliberately used licensing to 
quash the competing DR-DOS system is bogus. 
</P>
<P>
	``Where was competition hurt here?'' he asked U.S. District  
Court Judge Dee Benson, who is hearing Caldera's antitrust case 
against the much bigger software company. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera now owns DR-DOS, an operating system that in the late  
1980s and early 1990s was gaining a toehold against MS-DOS in the 
personal computer market. An operating system controls the basic 
functions of a computer. 
</P>
<P>
	Retail customers could have bought DR-DOS in stores, Klapper  
said. ``It was pretty clear they didn't want DR-DOS.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And manufacturers chose one of three kinds of MS-DOS licenses  
from Microsoft rather than DR-DOS, a product of DRI and later 
Novell, he said. ``They had choices and they made them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft is asking the judge to dismiss Caldera's claim that it  
kept a stranglehold on the personal computer operating system 
market with its licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The licensing claim is one of nine aspects of Caldera's case  
that Microsoft has asked the judge to throw out. Benson is hearing 
arguments on the nine motions this week and during June. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera, financed by former Novell chairman Ray Noorda, bought  
DR-DOS from Novell in 1996 and promptly filed the antitrust 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	Novell had stopped selling DR-DOS for personal computers in  
1994, but Caldera chief executive Bryan Sparks says he and Noorda 
wanted Microsoft held accountable for what they claim was 
anticompetitive behavior by a monopolist. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldera claims that personal computer manufacturers -- the  
biggest customers for operating systems -- were coerced to buy only 
Microsoft's MS-DOS. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the most economical licensing arrangement, manufacturers  
had to pay Microsoft a royalty whether they loaded MS-DOS or not, 
which made purchases of DR-DOS unlikely, Caldera says. 
</P>
<P>
	And the Redmond, Wash., company also used tactics that resulted  
in manufacturers ending their MS-DOS licensing periods with large 
account balances that could only be erased by renewing the 
licenses, Caldera alleges. 
</P>
<P>
	``A customer who had any crazy ideas about going with a  
competitor knew that his account was in jeopardy,'' Caldera 
attorney Stephen Susman argued on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Few manufacturers that signed Microsoft's restrictive licenses  
ever did business with DR-DOS, Caldera says. 
</P>
<P>
	Susman told the judge that it's silly for Microsoft to claim  
consumers could have bought DR-DOS if they preferred it over MS-DOS 
since retail sales are almost all software upgrades. Since the 
computers originally came with MS-DOS, consumers were unlikely to 
upgrade with DR-DOS. 
</P>
<P>
	Klapper said the fact Microsoft offered three kinds of licenses  
indicates it was not trying to crush DR-DOS. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, more than half of the licenses required manufacturers  
to pay only for each copy of Microsoft's operating system that they 
put in PCs or a line of PCs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	DRI and Novell had frequent chances to go after manufacturing  
customers as their Microsoft licenses expired, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Klapper said Microsoft was using its licensing practices before  
and after DR-DOS was a competitive threat, but the judge was 
dubious. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that the per-processor licenses -- the ones Caldera  
claims were anticompetitive -- made up the vast majority of 
Microsoft's MS-DOS licenses in precisely the years DR-DOS was 
competing against it. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge suggested that evidence alone may be sufficient for  
him to reject Microsoft's motion to dismiss and instead allow a 
jury to hear the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	A jury trial is scheduled for January.

	Personal Income Rises 0.5 Percent

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Money is burning a hole in Americans' pockets  
as consumers in April spent nearly as much as they earned, helping 
to push the nation's savings rate to an all-time low. Spending 
climbed 0.4 percent last month, a tad lower than the 0.5 percent 
increase in Americans' personal income, the Commerce Department 
reported today. ``You can't underestimate the hedonism of the 
American consumer,'' said economist Mark Zandi of Regional

group has pledged to locate. A group called Families of the 
Disappeared has campaigned for recovery of the bodies for five 
years.

	WINDHOEK, Namibia (AP) -- A lion killed a game warden at a  
private lodge outside Namibia's capital while nine horrified 
tourists looked on helplessly, local media reported today. Steyn 
Lusse was attacked yesterday inside the lions' enclosure on the 
popular Okapuka game farm outside Windhoek as he tried to free up a 
mechanism used to feed the lions. Witnesses say Lusse ignored 
warnings from the group of tourists from the United Kingdom, the 
United States and South Africa that one of the lions was stalking 
him.

<HEADLINE> NY Braces for Clinton-Guiliani Bout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Clash of the Titans! Better than the Coney  
Island roller coaster! A spectacle to rival Niagara Falls? 
</P>
<P>
	If Hillary Rodham Clinton enters New York's Senate race, it  
could be the state's wildest ever -- a sitting first lady pitted 
against the Big Apple's mayor in a campaign one political veteran 
thinks could be ``the all-time meanest, nastiest race ever in New 
York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What started as cocktail party chatter a few months ago  
apparently is about to break on Broadway with Mrs. Clinton in the 
starring role for the Senate seat being vacated next year by 
Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	She has called 200 New York politicians for advice, is learning  
exactly where Penn Yan is and apparently wants to drag her husband, 
the president, off to the wilds of the Adirondack Mountains or the 
windswept expanse of eastern Long Island for summer vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	She has gone so far as to ask state Democratic chairwoman Judith  
Hope to scout out living rooms in rural upstate New York where the 
folks might want to share coffee and cookies with a first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	The first couple is vacationing in Florida this Memorial Day  
weekend. When they return, top advisers say, Mrs. Clinton will 
either announce she is not running or will press ahead. If advisers 
get the green light, there would be an exploratory committee formed 
in late June or early July with a full-fledged candidacy sometime 
in the fall or later. 
</P>
<P>
	Hope and other advisers expect Mrs. Clinton -- who has never  
worked, lived or studied in the Empire State -- to enter the race, 
which could pit her against New York City's hard-nosed Republican 
mayor, Rudolph Giuliani. 
</P>
<P>
	``Giuliani, because of his nature, will throw every vile charge  
he can dream up at her,'' said former New York Mayor Edward Koch, a 
Democrat. ``I think she can beat him, but it will be a very tough 
race.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other prominent New York Democrats agree.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think Rudy and company will fight a pretty nasty battle,''  
said former Mayor David Dinkins, who beat Giuliani in 1989, only to 
lose to him in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``It could be the all-time meanest, nastiest race ever in New  
York,'' state Comptroller H. Carl McCall said. 
</P>
<P>
	Should Mrs. Clinton run, New York's political pros say she will  
not only face a brutal campaign, but could wind up hurting 
Democrats elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	And, on the Republican side, one veteran operative thinks the  
price of beating her may be so high as to leave any GOP winner with 
a ``Pyrrhic victory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She's going to take advantage of how she's perceived right  
now, which is as first lady, mother, wronged wife, feminist 
champion, humanitarian, martyr. She's going to run as St. Joan of 
Arc ... Eleanor Roosevelt reincarnated,'' GOP consultant Jay 
Severin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The sobering news for Republicans is that anybody who plans to  
beat her is going to have to knock her off every one of those 
pedestals ... and the cost of doing that is very high,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to being attacked as a carpetbagger, Mrs. Clinton  
will face questions again over Whitewater, Travelgate, her good 
fortune investing in cattle futures and her husband's infidelity. 
</P>
<P>
	She got a taste of that Wednesday when CBS' Dan Rather asked her  
what she would answer when asked, ``Why are you still with this 
man?'' 
</P>
<P>
	She noted they had been married for nearly 24 years.  
</P>
<P>
	There is also talk among some party stalwarts that by running a  
high-profile and expensive race in heavily Democratic New York, 
Mrs. Clinton could damage Vice President Al Gore's chances of 
moving up to the White House and even the party's chances of taking 
back Congress. She is considered one of the party's most effective 
campaigners. 
</P>
<P>
	``New York is one place where (Gore) needs her less,'' McCall  
said. ``He'd rather have her in Nebraska.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the carpetbagger charges will force her to stay in New York,  
said William Cunningham, a former Moynihan campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``If she runs in New York, she will not be available to campaign  
in other critical states and districts. That affects not only Gore 
but the whole effort to take back the House,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Spike Lee: Heston Comment Was Joke </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Spike Lee says he was joking when he suggested  
Charlton Heston should be shot. 
</P>
<P>
	The director was quoted in Saturday's New York Post as telling  
reporters at the Cannes Film Festival that the National Rifle 
Association should be disbanded and, of Heston, ``Shoot him with a 
.44 Bulldog.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I intended it as ironic, as a joke to show how violence begets  
more violence,'' Lee said Thursday. ``I told everyone there it was 
a joke. I said I did not want to read in the papers, 'Shoot 
Charlton Heston.''' 
</P>
<P>
	He said his remarks were in response to a question about whether  
Hollywood was to blame for the recent rash of school shootings. 
``The problem is guns,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee said he had no reason to apologize.  
</P>
<P>
	Heston, the NRA president, had earlier said the remarks amused  
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He gave me a big laugh,'' Heston said Thursday on the Los  
Angeles talk radio station KABC-AM. ``The statement is a foolish 
one and it's not worth arguing about. If he wants to come and take 
a shot at me, go let him try it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lee's comment had also prompted an outcry from House Majority  
Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas. Armey condemned Lee's ``embrace of 
violence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Spike Lee obviously has nothing to offer the debate on school  
violence except more violence and more hate,'' said Armey. ``He 
should apologize immediately for this unfortunate remark. 
</P>
<P>
	Lee, known for such films as ``Malcolm X,'' ``He Got Game'' and  
``Do the Right Thing,'' blamed guns for violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``The reason the United States is the most violent country in  
the history of civilization is the proliferation of guns,'' he said 
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Livestock Up; Oil Down  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	The prospect of hot, dry weather sent corn and soybean future  
prices surging Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Livestock futures prices also advanced, while oils and metals  
declined in sessions shortened to get a jump on the three-day 
Memorial Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Corn and soybean prices on the Chicago Board of Trade were  
boosted by reports of a possible high-pressure ridge forming next 
week in the U.S. Midwest, which could result in hot, dry conditions 
for newly planted crops. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting to June, and in June, July and August, there's  
always talk about the weather,'' said Dick Loewy, president of 
AgResource Co. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	But Loewy said there was little evidence of a drought pattern  
and believes the rally was mainly due to an oversold market as 
traders tried to even up their holdings to reduce risk before the 
long weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat continued to recover from new contract lows set on Monday  
as prices were supported by the prospects of more rain-induced crop 
disease. Reports from Oklahoma told of severe crop damage from hail 
earlier his week. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery settled 2 1/4 cents higher at $2.52 1/4 a  
bushel; July corn rose 3 cents to $2.19 1/2 a bushel; July oats rose 2 
cents to $1.23 a bushel; July soybeans rose 4 1/2 cents to $4.61 3/4 a 
bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Livestock prices were higher on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.  
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle reached a new six-week peak as traders  
anticipated a holiday weekend that would have consumers grilling 
hamburgers and driving up the demand for boxed beef. 
</P>
<P>
	Following cattle's strength, live hogs rebounded after hitting  
an eight-week low on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	June live cattle was .75 cent higher to 64.25 cents a pound;  
August feeder cattle rose .82 cent to 75.52 cents a pound; June 
lean hogs climbed .78 cent to 52.95 cents a pound; July pork 
bellies was up .65 cent to 53.37 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil and gasoline future prices tumbled on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange as some refineries reported production cutbacks 
due to a lack of demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas prices extended gains from Thursday, when traders  
received news that storage statistics were below market 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Light sweet crude for delivery in July fell 33 cents to $16.84 a  
barrel, June unleaded gasoline dropped 1.32 cents to 48.58 cents a 
gallon, June heating oil fell .82 cent to 39.43 cents a gallon, but 
July natural gas was up 7.8 cents at $2.36 per 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Precious metal future prices were lower on the New York  
Mercantile Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	July silver hit a six-week low of $4.88 late in the session,  
continuing a decline that started Thursday with the news of a large 
Australian sale of the metal and a reaction to cooper futures 
plunging to 12-year lows. 
</P>
<P>
	Gold for August delivery settled at $272 a troy ounce, down 20  
cents; while June silver was $4.89.5 a troy ounce, down 4.5 cents.

<HEADLINE> Bowman To Return As Red Wings Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Retirement simply doesn't appeal to Scotty  
Bowman. 
</P>
<P>
	Stopping just short of labeling himself a lifer, the most  
successful coach in NHL history said he'll return to the Detroit 
Red Wings next season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would have been difficult not to come back,'' the  
65-year-old Bowman said during a conference call Friday with 
general manager Ken Holland. ``I looked at the alternatives and 
they didn't look very good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowman, who got his first coaching job with a Montreal junior  
team in 1955, wouldn't discuss terms of his contract, but it is 
believed to be for one year with options that will allow him to 
continue for as long as he wants. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings made it clear long ago that he will always have a  
place in the organization. 
</P>
<P>
	``We met a couple of days ago and discussed the opportunity to  
come back,'' Bowman said. ``I had pretty much decided by the end of 
the season to make the decision pretty quickly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't get the job done this year ... and we have the right  
mix and with a few minor changes we should be able to contend again 
next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The decision came 10 days after the Red Wings were ousted from  
the playoffs in their bid for a third straight Stanley Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would have been a huge loss if Scotty had decided not to  
coach,'' Holland said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowman, who has won eight Stanley Cups, had angioplasty last  
July and knee replacement surgery in August. He missed all of 
training camp and the first five games this past season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I missed it when I was out,'' he said. ``Not being with the  
team is tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowman, whose brother died during heart surgery last June, had  
said he would not return unless cleared by his doctor. 
</P>
<P>
	He appeared to be leaning toward remaining behind the bench  
shortly after Detroit was eliminated in six games by Colorado in 
the second round of the playoffs. He said he was intrigued by the 
prospect of coaching in the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coaching in another decade is something that's there,'' Bowman  
said. ``It won't go away. But I'm actually more excited about 
coaching in 2000. If you get there, it means you had to play pretty 
well before Christmas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowman has a 1,100-516-284 regular-season record and a 204-116  
playoff record, the most victories of any NHL coach. His eight 
Stanley Cup titles match the number won by Toe Blake with Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowman came to Detroit in 1993 and quickly turned the Red Wings  
into an NHL power. The team won the Cup in 1997 and 1998, lost in 
the Cup finals to New Jersey in 1995 and played in the Western 
Conference finals in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Since having his arteries unblocked in July, Bowman has lowered  
his blood pressure and cholesterol through diet. 
</P>
<P>
	He remains devoted to daily workouts meant to improve mobility  
of his titanium knee. When his natural knee became so arthritic he 
hardly could walk to his car and needed a cane, Bowman decided to 
have the operation. Since then, he has regained 80 percent 
mobility. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he no longer has pain and did not doubt his decision to  
return for this past season. 
</P>
<P>
	So, is he a lifer?  
</P>
<P>
	``Bob Johnson used to put it pretty well when we were at  
Pittsburgh,'' Bowman said. ``He related it to golf. I know I'm on 
the back nine. I don't know what hole I'm on, but I'm out there 
somewhere.''

<HEADLINE> Chickenpox Vaccine Urged for Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- All states should require chickenpox vaccinations  
for children entering day care or elementary school, federal health 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The requirements are recommended because the highly contagious  
disease is most prevalent among children ages 1 to 6, the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 4 million Americans, mostly children, get chickenpox every  
year. Caused by the varicella virus, it typically just causes 
severe itching and rash in children. 
</P>
<P>
	The CDC estimates that in 1990-94, before the vaccination became  
available, about 100 people in the United States died each year 
from chickenpox complications such as pneumonia, hemorrhaging and 
blood infections. As many as 11,000 were hospitalized each year. 
</P>
<P>
	Researchers don't have precise numbers on how many people are  
dying now that the vaccine is available. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is data out there to suggest that deaths are continuing  
to occur,'' said Dr. Jane Seward of the CDC's National Immunization 
Program. ``It's not a lot compared to other vaccine-preventable 
diseases, but it's too many when you've got a way to prevent 
them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The vaccine is 80 to 90 percent effective, and protects against  
the most severe symptoms of chickenpox in all cases, according to 
the CDC. 
</P>
<P>
	The Food and Drug Administration approved the nation's first  
chickenpox vaccine, Varivax, in 1995 and the CDC and the American 
Academy of Pediatrics had recommended vaccinating children for 
chickenpox at 12 to 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Oklahoma, Oregon,  
Rhode Island, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia and Washington, D.C., have 
already passed laws requiring vaccinations for children.

<HEADLINE> Broad, Ovitz Might Join NFL Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Just two weeks after billionaire Eli Broad  
said he had no plans to join forces with Hollywood super agent 
Michael Ovitz to get an NFL team back in Los Angeles, the 
invitation was in the mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad wrote a letter to Ovitz and food magnate Ron Burkle on  
Thursday suggesting the chief rival to his group ``join our effort 
to obtain the expansion franchise.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, Broad implied he was confident his group  
would be successful in its quest to own the NFL's 32nd franchise, 
tentatively scheduled to begin play in 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter did not say who would lead the combined effort, but  
the implication was it would be the Broad team. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still have those last few yards to go before reaching the  
end zone,'' Broad wrote. ``To help us all get there, Ed Roski and I 
would like to extend an invitation for you to join our effort to 
obtain the expansion franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gentlemen, your joining us will send a clear message to the  
National Football League that we are committed to the success of 
professional football in Los Angeles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Broad alluded to the rival group's star power, telling Ovitz his  
``talent for marketing and promotions is world-renowned and will 
advance our mutual efforts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James Ellis, an attorney for Ovitz, said Friday his client and  
Burkle remain committed to bringing football to Los Angeles, and 
``doing whatever it takes to ensure a successful franchise is 
established here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether that's uniting with Broad remains to be seen.  
</P>
<P>
	David Carter, a sports business analyst, believes each side  
needs the other. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, both have suffered setbacks in the last week to 10  
days,'' Carter said. ``Obviously, if Broad was in a real position 
of strength, you would not have expected him to extend the olive 
branch to Ovitz.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carter believes the plan needs Broad for his money and Ovitz for  
his creativity. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz was in the Bahamas on Friday and unavailable for comment.  
</P>
<P>
	At its March meetings in Phoenix, the NFL tentatively awarded  
Los Angeles the franchise over Houston. But the league told Los 
Angeles it needed to come up with a viable plan by Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL has said it intends to put a team in a 76-year-old,  
reconstructed Coliseum. But it has yet to name a price or choose an 
owner. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad and Roski head one faction, while Ovitz has gathered a  
star-powered group that includes Burkle, actor Tom Cruise and 
former Los Angeles Lakers star Magic Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	A potential challenger to those groups surfaced recently when  
billionaire Marvin Davis obtained a signed option agreement from 
the Hollywood Park racetrack for 100 acres of land to develop a 
football stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	In Atlanta this week, Ovitz presented NFL owners with a plan  
intended to meet the league's specifications. Chief among those was 
that Exposition Park be altered to accommodate 25,000 parking 
spaces -- more than double the park's existing space. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ovitz plan would meet the NFL goal, but at a possible cost  
of more than $200 million in public financing. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Broad was on hand to tell league officials why  
Ovitz's plan could not win the necessary approvals, much less the 
public financing. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL tentatively endorsed Ovitz's proposal but said it needed  
more review time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Southern California taxpayers and politicians will not allow  
for the magnitude of that subsidy,'' Carter said. ``Ovitz's plan 
has some financial holes in it, Broad's plan doesn't have the 
sizzle that Ovitz's plans have. 
</P>
<P>
	``(NFL commissioner) Paul Tagliabue has talked about plan A and  
plan B, what he is hoping to do is have those two parties work 
together to have a plan C -- pull the marketing elements out of 
Ovitz's plan, and the financial elements out of Broad's plan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NFL is clearly trying to make these guys work together in  
order to maximize the amount of money to the NFL.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tagliabue and some owners have suggested the groups might want  
to work together.

<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Billionaire Eli Broad sent a letter to  
Hollywood magnet Michael Ovitz in an apparent effort to end the 
conflict over who will own the NFL franchise in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad wrote a letter Thursday to chief rival Ovitz and food  
magnate Ron Burkle stating the two groups should end their 
differences and present a united plan to the NFL. It did not 
specify who would lead the combined effort. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
	The Ovitz group includes such heavy hitters as former Los  
Angeles Lakers star Magic Johnson and actor Tom Cruise. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz told the Los Angeles Times in a story published today he  
intended to stick with his own plan. He declined to comment on 
joining forces with Broad's group. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Eli has something that makes good sense, then I'm willing  
to listen,'' Ovitz told the Times, after being contacted on his way 
to the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the two competing groups presented their  
plans during NFL meetings in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ovitz group plan included a lavish parking garage with a  
park on top. The NFL tentatively endorsed the proposal, but said it 
wanted more time to review it. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Stocks Rebound; Dow Up 88.11 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were rebounding today from Thursday's  
steep selloff as new economic data showing slower-than-expected 
growth helped calm fears about rising inflation and higher interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors also jumped at the chance to pick up shares at cheaper  
prices as a result of this week's turbulent slump on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	At 2 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average was up 88.11 at  
10,555.04. The blue-chip index rose as much as 120 points in 
morning trading. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the Dow plunged more than 235 points, or by 2.2  
percent, in its steepest one-day point drop since Sept. 30, 1998, 
when the Dow tumbled 237.20. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad-market indexes also rose today. After some weakness in  
early trading, the Nasdaq composite index, which has been battered 
recently by a steep decline in Internet stocks, was up 24.99 at 
2,444.14. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was light ahead of the three-day holiday weekend. U.S.  
financial markets will be closed Monday in observance of Memorial 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow has been seesawing all week with declines of more than 1  
percent on both Monday and Tuesday, then a rebound of more than 1 
percent on Wednesday before Thursday's slide. Heading into today's 
session, the average was down 362.35 points, or by 3.3 percent, for 
the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The volatile ride on Wall Street has been fueled by fears that  
any signs of rising inflation will prompt the Federal Reserve to 
raise interest rates to prevent the economy from overheating. 
Higher rates typically cut into profits as it becomes more 
expensive for companies to borrow money. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still are in a tug-of-war between those people who thing  
interest rates will go higher and those that don't,'' said Alan 
Ackerman, senior vice president at Fahnestock &AMP; Co. 
</P>
<P>
	But some of the fears about rising inflation and interest rates  
were tempered today after the Purchasing Management Association of 
Chicago reported a greater-than-expected drop in its business 
activity index. 
</P>
<P>
	That helped boost stocks, especially banks and financial  
services shares, which have been hurt by concerns over an 
interest-rate hike. Citigroup was up 2 1/4 at 65 11/16 and Merrill 
Lynch was up 1 3/4 at 84 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	A flood of bargain-hunters entering the market today also helped  
lift stocks. Investors were looking to pick up stocks at much 
cheaper prices than they were just a week ago. Microsoft rose 2 to 
80 3/8, and Amazon.com gained 3 13/16 to 118 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors was among the strongest Dow components, rising 2  
5/16 to 70 13/16 after completing the spinoff of its Delphi 
Automotive unit. Delphi shares were down 3/4 at 19 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 2-to-1 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 451.81 million 
shares, down from 534.22 million shares on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 19.24 at 1,300.65, the  
NYSE composite index was up 8.44 at 622.46, and the American Stock 
Exchange composite index was up 3.75 at 778.14.

<HEADLINE> Vintage Chinese Movies Saved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A hundred Chinese films from the 1950s and  
'60s were saved from a garbage bin and will be shipped to a Hong 
Kong archive. 
</P>
<P>
	The black-and-white Cantonese movies, which include features on  
Hong Kong folk hero and martial-arts master Wong Fei-Hung, were 
thrown away Tuesday from a leaky restaurant basement where they had 
been stored for years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe this is a historical record that needs to be  
preserved, and the film industry of that time deserves to be 
recognized,'' said Brian Lau, director of the San Francisco Asian 
American Film Festival. Film experts rescued the movies. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruby Yang and her husband, San Francisco film producer Lambert  
Yam, spent two days rummaging through the cinematic treasure, 
salvaging about half of the 200 film canisters. 
</P>
<P>
	Betty Gee, who sold the Golden Bull restaurant two years ago,  
left the canisters because she had no place for them. The films 
belonged to her late father-in-law, a onetime Hong Kong film 
director who ran a San Francisco Chinese theater until about 10 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The films eventually will be sent to the Hong Kong Film Archive.

<HEADLINE> Thymus Could Be Key in AIDS Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- An immune system gland once thought to be  
inactive in adults actually continues to function late in life, 
according to research that could lead to new ways of reactivating 
the natural defenses of AIDS and cancer patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The thymus, a pinkish-gray organ near the heart, is the primary  
source of germ-fighting T cells. It was believed to be active only 
during fetal development and childhood before slowly turning into 
fat in adults. 
</P>
<P>
	The research reported today in the journal Immunity suggests  
that although the gland's productivity slows with age, it remains 
active nonetheless. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gives us hope that if we can find ways to boost up the  
activity of the thymus, we could speed up the replacement of T 
cells'' lost to the AIDS virus, said Beth D. Jamieson, a biologist 
at the University of California, Los Angeles AIDS Institute who led 
the study. ``There's still a source available for T cells, which 
was not thought to be the case previously.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drugs also could be developed for cancer patients whose immune  
systems have been destroyed by chemotherapy. But tests of possible 
treatments are at least two years away, Jamieson said. 
</P>
<P>
	David Schwartz, professor of molecular microbiology-immunology  
at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, said the study offers 
important information that will be ``very useful for understanding 
how we can generate new immune responses as we get older.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It means we don't have to rely on T cells that are produced in  
the first decade of our lives,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous studies showed that new T cells were being produced by  
AIDS patients who had been taking potent combinations of AIDS 
drugs. But it was not known where in the body those cells were 
being created. 
</P>
<P>
	The research found that the thymus continues to turn stem cells  
produced by bone marrow into T cells that recognize the body's 
foreign invaders and either attack them directly or produce 
antibodies to finish them off. 
</P>
<P>
	The UCLA researchers studied more than a dozen thymuses from  
organ donors and people who had sections of their glands removed 
during heart surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	Although aging does not appear to decrease the effectiveness of  
the new T cells, it does lead to a reduction in quantity. The 
oldest subject in the testing was 56.

<HEADLINE> Kaczynski's Bid For New Trial Nixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- A federal judge has rejected Theodore  
Kaczynski's bid for a trial, turning aside the Unabomber's 
contention that he was forced into pleading guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Garland E. Burrell Jr. said Kaczynski's  
claims did not warrant a hearing and he dismissed the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski pleaded guilty in January 1998 to bombings that killed  
three people and injured 23. He was sentenced to life in prison 
without the possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
	The former math professor argued in recent filings that he was  
forced to either plead guilty or be portrayed at a trial as 
mentally ill by his attorneys, which he did not want. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaczynski also argued that he had wanted to replace his  
attorneys or represent himself, but was thwarted when Burrell ruled 
on the eve of the trial that the request came too late. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kaczynski's sense of coercion stems from his preference not to  
be portrayed as mentally ill and his feeling of injustice at being 
forced to accept a mental defense,'' the judge said. ``This type of 
personal pressure does not transform a plea into an involuntary 
act.''

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Questions Airdrop Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A humanitarian group's plans to drop food and  
supplies from airplanes flying over the disputed Kosovo region is 
risky, U.S. officials say, but they wish the private pilots well. 
</P>
<P>
	The International Rescue Committee, a private humanitarian  
organization based in New York, announced plans Friday to begin 
airdrops of food and supplies in Kosovo for hundreds of thousands 
of displaced ethnic Albanians. The first missions, scheduled for 
Monday, will be flown by Moldovan pilots in private planes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's not a good idea, frankly, as an airman,'' said  
Air Force Maj. Gen. Charles Wald, a Pentagon spokesman and F-16 
pilot. ``One reason I say that is because I have zero trust in what 
(Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic or his army might try to 
do. I think they're putting themselves ... at great risk in doing 
this. I hope it succeeds, for their sake.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wald said NATO will not patrol the air corridor the humanitarian  
group uses, meaning the private planes will be defenseless if the 
Serbs fire on them. 
</P>
<P>
	State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said there are plans  
to inform the Yugoslav military of the humanitarian flight 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're definitely supportive of that effort,'' Rubin said of  
the flights. ``We think that there are risks, but we also think 
there are gains if the planes can be flown in and tens of thousands 
of (food packages) can be brought to the people of Kosovo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NATO began bombing March 24 to protect the ethnic Albanian  
minority and expel Serb forces loyal to Milosevic. Roughly 40,000 
Serb troops occupy Kosovo, a rebellious province of Serbia, and 
have allegedly carried out a brutal, house-to-house campaign of 
ethnic terror. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians have fled Kosovo for  
camps in neighboring Balkan nations. Others are on the move inside 
Kosovo, and short of food. The airdrop plan is focused on these 
internal refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, officials disclosed that Defense Secretary William  
Cohen met in Bonn, Germany, on Thursday with defense ministers from 
member countries of the European Union. They reaffirmed NATO's air 
strategy and agreed that the alliance should attack an ever-wider 
array of targets, said a Pentagon spokesman, Lt. David Gai. 
</P>
<P>
	The defense ministers also endorsed a U.S. recommendation that  
an expanded peacekeeping force be in place ``as soon as possible, 
so it will be in place to enforce a peace agreement as soon as it 
is reached,'' Gai said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen's trip was not announced until after he returned.  
</P>
<P>
	Meeting with a group of reporters at the Pentagon on Friday,  
Cohen argued strongly for sticking with NATO's air-only military 
strategy in Yugoslavia. To push the allies into adding ground 
combat forces would risk fracturing NATO and undercutting support 
for the bombing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no consensus for a ground force,'' Cohen declared.  
</P>
<P>
	He predicted that Milosevic eventually will be brought to  
justice to face the war crimes charges issued this week by a U.N. 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Pentagon's regular briefing on NATO's air campaign, Wald  
said the airstrikes are intensifying, with the focus on facilities 
throughout Yugoslavia that command and control Serb military 
operations in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pentagon also said an Air Force A-10 ground-attack plane  
returned safely from Yugoslavia to its base in Italy on Friday 
after the pilot reported an explosion near the aircraft. Spokesman 
Col. Richard Bridges said the explosion caused a mechanical problem 
and the pilot aborted his mission and returned to base. 
</P>
<P>
	The incident was still being investigated, but the explosion  
apparently was from a Serb surface-to-air missile, Bridges said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wald said between five and 10 NATO planes have been hit by Serb  
air defenses since the start of the air campaign March 24. In that 
period, two have crashed -- an F-117 stealth fighter and an F-16 
fighter. A few weeks ago, an A-10 lost part of its engine but 
landed safely in Macedonia.

<HEADLINE> Inventor Peterson Dead at 78 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- Ed Peterson, inventor of the alarm that  
beeps to warn people when trucks and heavy machinery are backing 
up, has died at 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson, who died Wednesday, also invented collapsible luggage  
carriers, home security alarms and automotive electrical devices. 
</P>
<P>
	In the mid-1960s, he invented the Bac-A-Larm, marketing it  
initially to international construction and engineering giant 
Morrison Knudsen Corp., which, like Peterson's company, was based 
in Boise. 
</P>
<P>
	The system is used worldwide now, and the company he founded  
with his brother, Peterson Rebuild and Exchange Co., or Preco Inc. 
as it is known today, is the world's largest supplier of reverse 
warning systems.

<HEADLINE>  Sarajevo's Olympic Hall Reopens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- Zetra Olympic Hall,  
destroyed by Serb gunners during the Bosnian war, was reopened 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than 100 people attended a small, closed ceremony that  
featured a few dozen teenagers, dressed all in white, dancing 
briefly to broadcast music. A big ball symbolizing the Earth was 
placed in the middle of the hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, at this place, where until a few months ago there was  
nothing but senseless ruins, we are gathered to receive the gifts 
of Olympic friendship and solidarity,'' said Bogic Bogicevic, 
president of the Bosnian Olympic Committee. ``Here we witness the 
victory of good over evil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hall was rebuilt with the help of money from the  
International Olympic Committee, whose president, Juan Antonio 
Samaranch, turned over the key to Mayor Rasim Gacanovic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, we celebrate the culmination of our collaborative  
efforts to rebuild this Olympic Hall, which we hope will contribute 
to the process of reconstruction of Bosnia and reconciliation 
between its people,'' Samaranch said. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the European Union Office in Bosnia, Hansjorg  
Kretschmer, said that ``international sporting events at Zetra will 
carry a message of peace and understanding around the globe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``After nearly four years of grim fame as the besieged city in  
... Europe, Sarajevo is again becoming the city of the Winter 
Olympic Games,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zetra Hall was opened at the end of 1982 as one of the most  
important structures for the 1984 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Until it was bombed in May 1992, it was the site of many  
competitions and championships at a national and international 
level. To Sarajevans it was the symbol of the most memorable days 
of their city. 
</P>
<P>
	The hall, rebuilt for $17.8 million, features a shining new  
copper roof, built to match the original. There's one difference: 
Sarajevans no longer proceed to the Zetra Hall through a park and a 
former stadium. Both were turned into graveyards during the war. 
</P>
<P>
	The original opening ceremony was scheduled for March 30, with a  
pompous program including the performance of world class skaters. 
But NATO's airstrikes in neighboring Yugoslavia delayed the opening 
and canceled the extended program.

<HEADLINE> Title Quest Ends for Utah Jazz </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- It has been four years since the Utah Jazz  
had such a long, cold summer ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz cleaned out their lockers and said their goodbyes at  
the quiet Delta Center Friday, just hours after their season came 
to an end in Portland's Rose Garden. The Trail Blazers' 92-80 win 
knocked Utah out of the playoffs and pushed the aging team into an 
offseason of certain change. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know it won't be the same bunch coming back,'' said Bryon  
Russell, one of just five Jazz players under contract for next 
season. ``When you take a step back like that, you have to change 
things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Utah failed yet again in its Sisyphean quest for its first NBA  
title, but the Jazz admit this season's result, their earliest 
playoff exit since 1995, was the most disappointing yet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Bulls ended Utah's last two seasons in Game 6 of the  
NBA Finals. But with Michael Jordan in retirement, the spotlight 
seemed pointed at Karl Malone and John Stockton, the players who 
have waited longer than any in league history for their chance to 
lift that silver trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	With two straight Western Conference championships and a largely  
unchanged roster of veterans, Utah began the lockout-shortened 
season as a team most thought could win the first title of the 
post-Jordan era. For much of the regular season, Utah held the 
league's best record. 
</P>
<P>
	But starting April 20, when the Jazz had an 11-game winning  
streak snapped at home by the San Antonio Spurs, Utah's season 
began sliding downhill. The Jazz went just 5-5 in their last 10 
regular season games as the Spurs matched their league-best 37-13 
record and took away the West's top playoff seed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz narrowly survived their first-round series with  
Sacramento, rallying from a 2-1 deficit and twice holding their 
breath as potential series-ending Kings shots missed. Utah's 
offense, once the model of consistency and poise, was frequently 
erratic in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jazz were really no match for the younger, healthier and  
angrier Trail Blazers. Utah squeaked out a win in Game 1, but the 
Jazz were then beaten three straight times. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah recovered to win Game 5 convincingly. But on Thursday, the  
Jazz played another poor offensive game, and Malone -- the likely 
league Most Valuable Player -- capped his season with a 3-of-16 
shooting performance. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really think I pushed them as hard as I could push them,''  
said coach Jerry Sloan, who his players say is almost certain to 
continue his run as the NBA's longest-tenured coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mentally and physically, you just can't continue to do this  
the same way and at the same intensity year in and year out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the season's end, speculation in Salt Lake City turns to  
the fates of Malone, Stockton and Jeff Hornacek, Utah's signature 
veteran trio with 436 games of playoff experience and no 
championship rings. All three become free agents this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone and owner Larry Miller already have a handshake agreement  
for the Mailman to finish his career with the Jazz, but Malone has 
been known to change his mind. Malone, who is without a contract or 
an extension for the first time in his 14-year career, said he's 
``still not used to being a free agent, so I'm going to see what 
that's like for a little while.''

	The 37-year-old Stockton, the league's career leader in assists  
and steals, said Friday he intends to be back for a 16th season 
with Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lot more fun when you're winning, but right now, I  
still feel pretty good,'' said Stockton, who still says he has no 
idea when he might be ready to retire. ``Nobody feels as good as 
they did five years ago ... but I would hope to be back and try it 
another time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Before the lockout shortened the regular season, Hornacek had  
planned to retire in 1999. Now, he is looking forward to another 
run. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of our guys will be back,'' Hornacek said. ``Nobody wants  
to leave it like this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the Big Three, Utah's free agents are Shandon  
Anderson, Todd Fuller, Greg Foster and Thurl Bailey. At least one 
of them knows his time in Utah is past. 
</P>
<P>
	``You'll probably see me somewhere else,'' said Foster, who went  
from the Jazz's starting center in last year's NBA Finals to the 
11th man on the bench. ``You never know what can happen, but you'll 
probably see a whole new Jazz team next year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Utah's top priority is to re-sign Anderson, whose league profile  
rose rapidly during his stellar playoff performances. But he may be 
difficult to keep, particularly with Hornacek's decision to return. 
</P>
<P>
	It's obvious Anderson is ready for more playing time and  
responsibility, and the solution may be to give him minutes at both 
shooting guard and small forward, both of which he played equally 
well in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	``My first option is to come back here,'' Anderson said. ``The  
most important thing to me is playing time. ... If I'm going to get 
enough minutes and have a chance to be productive, I'll be very 
happy here.''

<HEADLINE>  Albanian Army Stages War Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUKES, Albania (AP) -- Firing hundreds of artillery shells and  
rockets toward the embattled Kosovo frontier on Friday, the 
Albanian army simulated a defense of its territory against a 
cross-border strike by Serbian forces. 
</P>
<P>
	The war games involved tanks, howitzers and 1,200 ground troops  
maneuvering several miles from the border, where Serbian forces 
have clashed with guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation Army in 
recent days. 
</P>
<P>
	Western military sources said NATO tried unsuccessfully to stop  
the exercise, fearing a Serbian military response in an area packed 
with more than 100,000 Kosovo refugees and international aid agency 
personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	But NATO spokesman Jamie Shea played down any objections within  
the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that we are unhappy about it,'' Shea said, noting  
that Albania has been fired upon by the Serbs and ``has the right 
to take any steps which it deems necessary to defend itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added, however, that helicopter flights of refugees had been  
suspended during the exercise. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter sent Thursday to the U.N. refugee agency in Tirana  
and Kukes, the NATO-led force in Albania said that in its 
assessment ``the conduct of a military exercise so close to the 
border with Kosovo could elicit a Serbian artillery response.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It said ``prudent protective measures should be followed during  
and immediately after any live firing of artillery or other major 
weapons by the Albanian army.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was no report of a response from the Serbs, dug in just  
behind the key border crossing point at Morini. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perhaps the Serbs will shoot back, but we are not afraid of  
them. We are going to defend our borders, our area,'' said Kukes 
military commander Gen. Kujdesi Lamaj. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20,000-strong Albanian army is widely regarded as inferior  
to the Serb military machine. It nearly collapsed two years ago 
when a failed pyramid investment scheme sparked enraged citizens to 
storm barracks and loot armories. 
</P>
<P>
	Observed by Albanian President Rexhep Meidani and the country's  
top government leaders and military officers, Albanian troops fired 
off artillery and tank shells as well as rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	Several foreign military observers, including U.S. and British  
personnel, were also present. The scenario for the exercise was a 
defense of the Kukes area from a hypothetical Serbian attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Target areas for the Albanian fire were hillsides located  
several miles from the Morini checkpoint. 
</P>
<P>
	An Albanian man was evacuated during the war games by a U.S.  
military helicopter. One report said he was a soldier, but other 
sources said a civilian was shot and severely wounded when he 
attempted to steal a tractor from refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, which processes  
refugees at Morini, pulled out during the exercise and warned 
journalists to exercise caution. 
</P>
<P>
	``UNHCR is very concerned that this could draw incoming  
artillery fire from the Serb side with disastrous effects for the 
refugees,'' spokesman Kris Janowski said in Geneva, referring to 
tens of thousands of Kosovo Albanian refugees concentrated in the 
Kukes area. 
</P>
<P>
	UNHCR personnel also withdrew from Morini, less than 30 miles  
from Kukes, on Thursday when the Serbs and KLA guerrillas traded 
gunfire for a second day. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the clashes, UNHCR spokesman Rupert Colville said 436  
refugees crossed the border at Morini from Kosovo. Another 542 
refugees left Kukes refugees camps on Friday as part of an 
organized relocation to safer camps in central and southern 
Albania.

<HEADLINE> Sun Microsystems Tests New Chip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALO ALTO, Calif. (AP) -- Volume production of Sun Microsystems  
Inc.'s UltraSparc-III microprocessor is expected to begin by the 
end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	New computer servers and workstations based on the high-speed  
chip are planned for next spring, according to today's edition of 
The Wall Street Journal. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers have already tested the chips to boot up Sun's Solaris  
operating system, The Journal said. 
</P>
<P>
	Next, the chips will undergo a series of tests designed to  
exercise as many of its operating modes as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	The UltraSparc-III, with 23 million transistors and operating  
speeds of 600 megahertz, is the latest entry from Palo Alto-based 
Sun in the race to deliver high-end computing systems used by big 
networks and Internet businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Mel Friedman, president of Sun's microelectronics division, said  
Sun received the first samples of the chips three weeks ago from 
Texas Instruments Inc., The Journal reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Instruments produces most of Sun's chips.

<HEADLINE> Court Overturns US Air Union Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal court panel ruled Friday that a 1997  
union election in which US Airways passenger service employees 
decided to join the Communications Workers of America should be set 
aside. 
</P>
<P>
	The Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled  
that a lower court judge was wrong to throw out a prior election in 
which the employees voted against joining the CWA. 
</P>
<P>
	Following the earlier election, the National Mediation Board  
ruled that the airline had tainted the vote by holding 
employer-employee roundtable discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Appeals Court judge Laurence Silberman wrote for the  
three-judge panel that ``the board's order unconstitutionally 
restrained US Airways' speech leading up to the rerun election.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the first vote, held Jan. 30, 1997, some 9,272 workers were  
eligible to vote, but the Communications Workers fell short of a 
majority with only 3,973 voting to join. The CWA appealed to the 
mediation board and won. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second vote, held Sept. 29, 1997, 4,773 people, or 54  
percent of the 8,772 employees eligible, voted in favor. The 
airline appealed that vote to the U.S. District Court and lost. 
</P>
<P>
	Either the mediation board or the Communications Workers of  
America could appeal Friday's ruling to the full Circuit Court or 
to the Supreme Court.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda Declares Cease-Fire in Congo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) -- Rwanda declared a unilateral cease-fire  
Friday in Congo, where it has been backing the rebels fighting to 
oust Congolese President Laurent Kabila. The declaration appeared 
to challenge Kabila to comply. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign Minister Amri Sued Ismael said in a news conference that  
the cease-fire will take effect at midnight local time (6 p.m. EDT) 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is to enhance chances for a negotiated settlement in  
Congo,'' Sued told reporters. ``We shall see tomorrow how the other 
parties will react. If they don't respect our unilateral 
declaration, then we shall evaluate our position.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and Kabila signed a cease-fire  
agreement on April 18 that was mediated by Libyan leader Moammar 
Gadhafi. But Rwanda and the Congolese rebels rejected the deal as 
premature and said it was reached without their consultation. 
</P>
<P>
	Relations between Rwanda and Uganda have since been strained  
over how to end the Congolese war, and the tension has helped to 
widen rifts between rebel factions. 
</P>
<P>
	Sued denied the declaration had anything to do with Libyan  
troops arriving in Uganda earlier this week in what Libya said was 
the ``vanguard'' of an African force to monitor the peace deal 
signed in April. Under the deal, foreign peacekeepers would be 
deployed only after a cease-fire, but none had been declared until 
now. 
</P>
<P>
	With the help of troops and equipment from Rwanda and Uganda,  
Congolese rebels have captured the eastern third of the country 
since they took up arms in August. They accuse Kabila of nepotism, 
corruption and ethnic warmongering. 
</P>
<P>
	Congolese rebels could not be reached for comment, but Rwandan  
officials said the main rebel group had agreed to participate in 
the cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Congo's information minister, Didier Mumengi, reached in the  
Congolese capital, Kinshasa, said Rwandan defense minister and top 
strategist, Paul Kagame, ``has been trapped'' by Uganda's signing 
of a peace deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Congolese Justice Minister Mwenze Kongolo was reportedly heading  
to Kampala, Uganda, Friday to hold talks with Libyan and Ugandan 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Rwanda is operating with rebels in the central and southern  
portion of eastern Congo, while Uganda is backing rebel forces 
further north. 
</P>
<P>
	In Kampala, the independent Monitor newspaper reported Friday  
that troops and anti-aircraft equipment had been withdrawn from 
several towns in eastern Congo that are held by the rebels and 
their Rwandan allies. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Rwanda and Uganda have said they are fighting in Congo to  
secure their borders from armed groups operating in the east, and 
they have blamed Kabila for neglecting to secure the areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Rwanda has said it will not stop fighting or withdraw troops  
until at least 5,000 Hutu militiamen responsible for the 1994 
genocide in Rwanda and fighting alongside Kabila's army are 
defeated or disarmed.

<HEADLINE>  Asian Stock Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets ended the week sharply  
lower Friday on the back of a tumble overnight on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 204.51  
points, or 1.26 percent, to finish the day at 15,972.68. On 
Thursday, the Nikkei index shed 53.33 points, or 0.33 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices fell because investors were worried about a possible  
slowdown in the U.S. economy following Thursday's plunge in New 
York stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street overnight, the Dow Jones industrial average sank  
235.23 points to 10,466.93, its worst single-session decline of the 
year and its lowest level since April 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo stock prices fell sharply in the morning as investors  
dumped export-oriented shares such as telecommunications and 
electronics issues after their U.S. counterparts fell. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the afternoon domestic institutional investors began  
buying shares seen as having strong earnings potential, pulling the 
market off its lows. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 120.52 yen, down 1.91  
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but above its late New York level 
of 120.38 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian shares tumbled as jittery investors took profits in  
view of possible clashes during a large election campaign rally, 
weak regional sentiment and Thursday's fall on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Security was tight when hundreds of thousands of people jammed  
Jakarta's main streets in a show of support for Indonesian 
presidential frontrunner Megawati Sukarnoputri. 
</P>
<P>
	Tensions were rising elsewhere in Indonesia with clashes between  
rival parties leaving at least 20 injured. Indonesia holds a 
parliamentary election early next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jakarta Stock Exchange's Composite Index fell 19.467 points,  
or 3.2 percent, to 583.649. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 2 percent, or  
249.28 points, closing at 12,059.25. On Thursday, the index had 
slumped 100.63 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said investors dumped shares in reaction to Thursday's  
slide on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Worries over U.S.-China relations strained by U.S. allegations  
that China has stolen American nuclear secrets also dampen market 
sentiment, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Going against the trend was the Seoul Stock Exchange, where the  
key index rose for a fourth consecutive session in reaction to the 
rise of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger yen helps South Korean companies gain a competitive  
edge against their Japanese rivals since they compete directly in 
such industries as semiconductors, steel and automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korea Composite Stock Price Index rose 5.58 points, or 0.7  
percent, to 732.24.

<HEADLINE> Tips on Avoiding Bogus Talent Scout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Some tips from the Federal Trade Commission on avoiding talent  
scout scams: 
</P>
<P>
	--Steer clear of modeling companies that require you to use a  
specific photographer. Compare fees and the work quality of several 
photographers. 
</P>
<P>
	--Be suspicious if a company requires an upfront fee to serve as  
your agent. 
</P>
<P>
	--Be cautious if the school has a special referral relationship  
with a specific modeling agency. The two could be splitting your 
fees, or the agency may not be suited to your needs. 
</P>
<P>
	--Avoid high-pressure sales tactics. Never sign a document  
without reading and understanding it first. Ask for a blank copy of 
the contract to take home and review with someone you trust. If the 
company refuses, walk away. 
</P>
<P>
	--Be wary of claims about high salaries. Successful models in  
small markets can earn $75 to $150 an hour, but the work is 
irregular. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ask for the names, addresses and phone numbers of models and  
actors who have secured successful work recently based on the 
company's training. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ask your local Better Business Bureau, consumer protection  
agency and state attorney general's office if there are any 
unresolved consumer complaints on file about the company.

<HEADLINE>  Asian Stock Markets Close Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets ended the week sharply  
lower Friday on the back of a tumble overnight on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo's benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 204.51  
points, or 1.26 percent, to finish the day at 15,972.68. On 
Thursday, the Nikkei index shed 53.33 points, or 0.33 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices fell because investors were worried about a possible  
slowdown in the U.S. economy following Thursday's plunge in New 
York stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street overnight, the Dow Jones industrial average sank  
235.23 points to 10,466.93, its worst single-session decline of the 
year and its lowest level since April 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo stock prices fell sharply in the morning as investors  
dumped export-oriented shares such as telecommunications and 
electronics issues after their U.S. counterparts fell. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the afternoon domestic institutional investors began  
buying shares seen as having strong earnings potential, pulling the 
market off its lows. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 120.52 yen, down 1.91  
yen from late Thursday in Tokyo but above its late New York level 
of 120.38 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Indonesian shares tumbled as jittery investors took profits in  
view of possible clashes during a large election campaign rally, 
weak regional sentiment and Thursday's fall on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Security was tight when hundreds of thousands of people jammed  
Jakarta's main streets in a show of support for Indonesian 
presidential frontrunner Megawati Sukarnoputri. 
</P>
<P>
	Tensions were rising elsewhere in Indonesia with clashes between  
rival parties leaving at least 20 injured. Indonesia holds a 
parliamentary election early next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The Jakarta Stock Exchange's Composite Index fell 19.467 points,  
or 3.2 percent, to 583.649. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, the blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 2 percent, or  
249.28 points, closing at 12,059.25. On Thursday, the index had 
slumped 100.63 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said investors dumped shares in reaction to Thursday's  
slide on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
	Worries over U.S.-China relations strained by U.S. allegations  
that China has stolen American nuclear secrets also dampen market 
sentiment, they said. 
</P>
<P>
	Going against the trend was the Seoul Stock Exchange, where the  
key index rose for a fourth consecutive session in reaction to the 
rise of the Japanese yen against the U.S. dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	A stronger yen helps South Korean companies gain a competitive  
edge against their Japanese rivals since they compete directly in 
such industries as semiconductors, steel and automobiles. 
</P>

percent, to 732.24.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Cigarettes May Get New Names </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- A Taiwan health official said Friday that  
the country's most popular brands of cigarettes -- Longevity, 
President and Paradise -- may have to be renamed because they 
suggest that smoking is good. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Health Administration plans to propose a law that  
bans cigarette names suggesting ``positive values,'' said Chen 
Tsai-chin, an NHA department head. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan needs to tighten its smoking law further because surveys  
show that an alarming 47 percent of males and 5 percent of females 
smoke cigarettes regularly, Chen said. 
</P>
<P>
	But an official at the government-run Bureau of Wine and Tobacco  
Monopoly, maker of Taiwan's leading cigarette brands, wondered if 
such a law would require the banning of foreign brands such as 
Lucky Strike and Virginia Slims.

<HEADLINE> Father Pleads Guilty in Kidnap Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Florida socialite Stephen Fagan pleaded  
guilty to kidnapping Friday, admitting he took his two girls 20 
years ago and told them their mother was dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Under terms of the deal, Fagan, who invented a life for himself  
and his girls in Florida, must pay a $100,000 fine, to be given to 
the New England Home for Little Wanderers. The charity was chosen 
by his ex-wife, Barbara Kurth. 
</P>
<P>
	Kurth was in court, but chose not to speak. It was the first  
time she, her daughters and her ex-husband had been in the same 
room together since he took the girls from her home. 
</P>
<P>
	Fagan received a suspended three- to five-year state prison  
sentence and must serve probation for five years. He was also 
ordered to perform 2,000 hours of community service at the 
Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in West Palm Beach, 
Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Fagan would have faced up to 20 years in prison if convicted of  
two counts of kidnapping. 
</P>
<P>
	In October 1979, Fagan allegedly kidnapped the two girls, then 2  
and 5, from Massachusetts and moved them to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Fagan, 57, who has been free on $250,000 bail, claims he rescued  
the girls from an unfit and alcoholic mother. The courts at the 
time, he said after his arrest, didn't look kindly on a father 
seeking custody. 
</P>
<P>
	Kurth, who was divorced from Fagan in 1978, denies the charge  
and said she was suffering from narcolepsy, an illness that causes 
sudden, deep sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	Fagan was living under the assumed name Dr. William Martin when  
he was arrested in his Palm Beach, Fla., mansion last April after 
eluding authorities for 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of his arrest, he was driving expensive cars and was  
a member in some of the most exclusive clubs in Palm Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	His daughters, Rachael and Lisa Martin, who are now in their  
20s, have stood by him. They have described him as supportive, 
loving, warm and kind -- a provider who did what he had to do to 
keep them safe. 
</P>
<P>
	Kurth, now a biologist at the University of Virginia, has been  
unsuccessful thus far in reuniting with her daughters, her lawyer 
has said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some legal observers questioned whether prosecutors would be  
sending the wrong message with such a lenient deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kidnapping is a very serious offense and it's not less serious  
because a parent commits the act,'' said Wendy Murphy, a former 
prosecutor and legal analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	Just because the daughters don't want to see their father  
imprisoned doesn't mean Fagan automatically deserves to remain 
free, Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact that the kidnaping happened two decades ago doesn't  
lessen the seriousness of what he allegedly did, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would have been in a huge pile of trouble had we caught him  
sooner,'' said Murphy, who heads the Victim Advocacy and Research 
Group.

<HEADLINE> India-Pakistan Fight Worries U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A carefully nurtured effort by the United  
States and other nations to promote restraint between nuclear 
rivals India and Pakistan is being threatened by renewed 
skirmishing over the disputed frontier region of Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
	Though the Clinton administration believes the situation has not  
yet reached the crisis stage, State Department spokesman James P. 
Rubin expressed ``grave concern'' on Friday. The two nations have 
already fought three wars, two of them directly related to the 
Kashmir conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe that Indian and Pakistani military and political  
leaders need to be in touch so there are no misunderstandings and 
miscalculations,'' he said. ``We think they should support 
bilateral diplomatic efforts to pull their countries back from the 
danger of a heightened and far more dangerous conflict.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The latest flareup occurred when secessionist Islamic militants  
sought to seize territory in the region of Kashmir controlled by 
India. An Indian helicopter gunship was shot down Friday, a day 
after Pakistan's armed forces said they had shot down two Indian 
jet fighters on the Pakistani side of the border that divides the 
province. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the key obstacle to the outbreak of a land war in  
Kashmir itself is the forbidding 11,000-foot terrain. Warfare 
between the two countries normally has been conducted on more 
hospitable ground. 
</P>
<P>
	As evidence that the Clinton administration believes the  
situation is still manageable, it has not sent a high-level envoy 
to region. Strobe Talbott, the No. 2 State Department official and 
the administration's point man for the issue, is being apprised of 
developments while traveling in Europe, but his time has been 
largely devoted to the Kosovo crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Concerns over the situation in South Asia escalated dramatically  
last year when first India, and then Pakistan, carried out 
underground nuclear tests and declared themselves nuclear powers. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and other powers acted swiftly to urge  
restraint in such areas as nuclear testing, the export of 
nuclear-related materials and the conversion of nuclear technology 
into weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	To the extent that there has been progress, it has been in the  
area of stated intentions rather than concrete actions. Still, the 
willingness of the two sides to show restraint prompted President 
Clinton last November to ease some of the sanctions he imposed 
after the underground tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the most promising development occurred in February when  
Prime Ministers Atal Bihari Vajpayee of India and Nawaz Sharif of 
Pakistan met in Lahore, Pakistan. There they pledged to reduce the 
risk of an accidental nuclear war, stop interfering in each other's 
affairs and adopt confidence building measures, including advance 
warning of missile tests. 
</P>
<P>
	But the good will proved to be fragile. Once the guerrillas  
penetrated the Indian-controlled area, India responded early this 
month with airstrikes in an effort to evict them. India says the 
insurgents are backed by Pakistan. Pakistan says the flight 
patterns of Indian jets suggest aggressive intentions. 
</P>
<P>
	Guerrilla infiltrations have occurred before, but the current  
one is distinguished by attempts to seize territory as opposed to 
engaging in hit-and-run operations. The latest penetration prompted 
India to use its air power in the region for the first time since 
1971. 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Hammer, a spokesman for the National Security Council,  
said, ``We are concerned about the rising escalation of violence in 
Kashmir. We have appealed to the governments in both India and 
Pakistan to abide by the terms of the Lahore accords.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and its colleagues on the U.N. Security  
Council have all made separate appeals to the two sides to 
encourage calm. 
</P>
<P>
	Karl Inderfurth, the top State Department official for South  
Asian affairs, relayed that message on Thursday to the respective 
ambassadors of India and Pakistan. The message has been repeated by 
U.S. envoys in New Delhi and Islamabad.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- GTE Corp. is selling local telephone systems  
serving a total of 200,000 customer lines in four states. 
</P>
<P>
	Still awaiting government approval of its deal to be acquired by  
Bell Atlantic, GTE is selling 154 local exchanges with 186,839 
access lines in Arizona, California, and Minnesota to Citizens 
Utilities Co. for $664 million in cash.

lines in Alaska to the Alaska Telephone Exchange Acquisition Corp. 
for an undisclosed amount. 
</P>
<P>
	The two deals are part of GTE's previously announced plan to

<HEADLINE> Pole vaulter Hartwig Raises Snakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EUGENE, Ore. (AP) -- Pole vaulters have a reputation for being a  
little off-beat, and Jeff Hartwig is no exception. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartwig, though, is perhaps more off the beaten track than most,  
at least in his choice of hobbies. 
</P>
<P>
	He raises and sells snakes.  
</P>
<P>
	``They're a good escape from the pressures of training and  
traveling,'' said Hartwig, the American indoor and outdoor 
record-holder in the pole vault and the favorite in Sunday's 
Prefontaine Classic, an IAAF Grand Prix meet. 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, Hartwig left his pets at home in Jonesboro, Ark. They  
include boas and pythons, some as long as 14 feet, plus a bunch of 
lizards. 
</P>
<P>
	There's always the fear that when he's gone, something unusual  
might occur. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a neighbor who said that if Jeff's house blows away,  
there will be snakes all over the place,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	When he's home, Hartwig is mesmerized by his collection.  
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes, I'll just look at one snake for 35 or 40 minutes,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In turn, Hartwig's pets are mesmerized by him.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have a 6-foot lizard,'' he said. ``He pays attention to what  
I say.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the pets are well-behaved.  
</P>
<P>
	``I can play with quite a few of them,'' Hartwig said. ``But I  
also have some meaner snakes. I can't pick them up because they'll 
bite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the tamer ones is a Burmese python named Niki. He took  
her to practice, where she lolled in the steeplechase water-jump 
pit. Another, a 10 1/2-2-foot python named John, slept in Hartwig's 
water bed. Hartwig slept on top of him without a problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Hartwig is so fond of his pets that he recently built a  
600-square-foot snake room in his basement with running water in 
the cages. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a good healthy environment for them,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Hartwig has so many snakes that he's thinking about putting a  
sign outside his house that says, ``Beware of snakes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier in the year, he had 42 snakes. Then, when he was in  
Maebashi, Japan, for the World Indoor Championships in March, his 
collection nearly doubled when 39 babies were hatched. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect 110 more babies,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	A lot of the babies are sold to pet stores.  
</P>
<P>
	Hartwig's fondness for snakes began when he was growing up in  
St. Charles, Mo., a suburb of St. Louis 
</P>
<P>
	``I was always in the woods catching snakes or whatever I could  
get,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The turning point came when a friend with a 10 1/2-foot snake moved  
and couldn't take the reptile with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I took it off his hands,'' Hartwig said.  
</P>
<P>
	Hartwig not only is serious about caring for his pets, but also  
about pole vaulting. 
</P>
<P>
	He broke the American indoor record twice this year, raising the  
mark to 19 feet, 5 inches. Last year, he set the U.S. outdoor mark 
of 19-8 1/2 at the Goodwill Games in Uniondale, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	He will compete in Uniondale again June 6 in the inaugural TFA  
Pro Championships, against a field including 1996 Olympic champion 
Jean Galfione of France. 
</P>
<P>
	First, Hartwig will defend his title in the Prefontaine Classic  
against an all-American field, including former U.S. record-holder 
Lawrence Johnson. Last year, Hartwig won at 19-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he has even greater ambitions, such as breaking Sergei  
Bubka's world outdoor record of 20-1 3/4. Bubka's indoor mark is 20-2. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bubka's records are becoming approachable,'' Hartwig said.  
``Once, other athletes regarded him as in another class.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bubka had a foot operation and was on crutches in February, but  
he's back training and Hartwig expects the imperturbable Ukrainian 
to try for his seventh consecutive world title in Seville, Spain, 
in August. He's not sure Bubka can win again. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are too many guys jumping well and it will take an  
incredible performance by him,'' Hartwig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Considered to have the best chances to stop Bubka's remarkable  
streak are Galfione, Maksim Tarasov of Russia, Tim Lobinger and 
Danny Ecker of Germany -- and Hartwig. 
</P>
<P>
	That's if he can slither over the bar with the same charm he  
uses on his snakes.

<P>
	AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Nearly 1 million Plymouth Voyager,  
Dodge Caravan and Chrysler Town &AMP; Country minivans are being 
recalled to check for short circuits that have caused air bags to 
inflate inadvertently. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimerChrysler AG announced the voluntary recall of 996,939  
vehicles on Friday. It covers the vehicles for model years 1994-95, 
the automaker said. 
</P>
<P>
	The recall comes after about 35 reports of inadvertent  
deployment of driver's side air bags caused by a short in the 
wiring harness. Most of the incidents happened when the vehicle was 
started. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been no reported injuries.  
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler said vehicle owners will be notified in about a  
month and any wiring shorts in the airbag systems will be repaired 
at no cost to owners.

<HEADLINE> Avs Seeks To End Scoring Drought </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Any time the Colorado Avalanche players aren't  
doing their jobs, they can expect to hear from goalie Patrick Roy. 
This time, he's firing shots at struggling superstars Joe Sakic and 
Peter Forsberg. 
</P>
<P>
	After Colorado's 3-0 loss to Dallas in Game 3 of the Western  
Conference finals Wednesday night, he bluntly said Sakic and 
Forsberg need to produce if the Avalanche hope to erase a 2-1 
series deficit against the Stars. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's right on,'' Sakic said Thursday as Colorado prepared for  
tonight's game against the Stars. ``It's not that we're not working 
hard, but we're not scoring. I know my role, and I have to put the 
puck in the net for us to be successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the cause of Sakic's slump is hard to pinpoint, Forsberg's  
lack of scoring punch can be attributed to the personal attention 
of Dallas defensemen Derian Hatcher and Guy Carbonneau. 
</P>
<P>
	Carbonneau, 39, shadowed Forsberg with success in the first two  
games of the series before Hatcher drew the arduous task for Game 3 
and Game 4. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whether I wanted the assignment or not, I got it,'' Hatcher  
said. ``I would rather play against the other lines. ... He is one 
of the harder guys in the league to defend. He is so strong on his 
skates. You can't knock him down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forsberg, who leads all playoff scorers with 20 points, had a  
goal and an assist in Game 1, but has been held to one assist in 
the last two games -- both Colorado losses. 
</P>
<P>
	The ineffectiveness of Forsberg and Sakic, who has not scored in  
the last 10 playoff games, is just the start for the Avalanche. 
Colorado turned the puck over 23 times in Game 3 and rarely 
challenged Dallas goalie Ed Belfour on rebounds in front of the 
net. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought Eddie had a very easy game in Game 3,'' Roy said.  
``He could have sat in a chair. I think we have to make it tougher 
on him like they did on me in Game 2 and Game 3.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The last time the Avalanche were shut out at home in the  
playoffs, they rebounded to win four straight against defending 
Stanley Cup champion Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have the ability to do that,'' Dallas defenseman Shawn  
Chambers said. ``They have so many talented players. They have 
three lines of straight talent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado's unpredictable temperament is enough to keep Stars  
coach Ken Hitchcock from daydreaming about finally reaching the 
Stanley Cup finals after 19 years of coaching junior hockey. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think either team has control of anything right now,''  
Hitchcock said. ``We certainly as a group don't feel we have 
control of any momentum other than we gained home ice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even home ice means nothing to the Avalanche, 7-1 on the road in  
the playoffs and 2-5 at home. They were booed regularly by the home 
crowd Wednesday and skated off to a near-empty McNichols Arena. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the position we hoped to be in, but we're just a win  
away from tying the series,'' Roy said. ``We all understand the 
importance of (tonight's) game. We have to come up with our biggest 
home game of the season.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Faults Japan on Computer Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- U.S. computer companies continue to face obstacles  
in the Japanese government market and Japan should work harder to 
give them better access, U.S. officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``U.S. computer hardware and software companies, which are  
global technology leaders with long-term commitments to the 
Japanese market, continue to encounter difficulties in gaining full 
access to the Japanese government market,'' the U.S. Embassy said 
in a news release. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement came after an annual review of implementation of  
measures related to Japanese government procurement of computer 
products and services. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. government and American companies have long complained  
that Japan shuts out foreign firms though a complex web of 
government regulations and informal barriers such as cozy ties 
among domestic enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
	At Friday's review meeting, the Japanese government showed that  
for fiscal 1997, which ended on March 31, 1998, the foreign share 
of Japanese government procurement of computers and computer 
systems was 16.5 percent, up from 15.9 percent a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	In comparison, foreign computer companies represent 35 percent  
of the private sector market, the U.S. Embassy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. representatives urged their Japanese counterparts to  
take steps to enhance fairness and transparency in government 
procurement.

<HEADLINE> Selig To Review Shoeless Joe Files </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig is  
``reviewing the entire file'' of banned baseball legend Shoeless 
Joe Jackson, Sen. Tom Harkin said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Harkin, D-Iowa, wrote to Selig in March, asking the commissioner  
to reinstate Jackson to baseball, a move that would make him 
eligible for the Baseball Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Harkin became interested in the 75-year-old case after the movie  
``Field of Dreams,'' in which Jackson is a central character, was 
filmed in his state. He asked Selig look at the records again and 
on Friday, he released the response to his request. 
</P>
<P>
	``I certainly understand your thoughts relative to Shoeless Joe  
Jackson and I am reviewing the entire file,'' Selig said in a 
letter to Harkin. ``It is a very tragic story and I certainly will 
try to be objective, as well as fair, in reviewing the entire 
file.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In New York, a spokesman for the commissioner could not confirm  
that Selig was conducting an official review. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1920, Jackson and seven other members of the Chicago White  
Sox were charged with accepting bribes to throw the 1919 World 
Series against the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson was banned from baseball by commissioner Kenesaw  
Mountain Landis, even though a Chicago jury later acquitted him of 
any wrongdoing in the scandal. Despite that acquittal, Jackson was 
never reinstated to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope to meet with the baseball commissioner to discuss this  
issue,'' Harkin said Friday. ``The reinstatement of Shoeless Joe 
would benefit major league baseball, baseball fans and all 
Americans who appreciate a sense of fair play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In his letter, Selig said the review likely would be lengthy  
because of the amount of time that has elapsed since the incident. 
</P>
<P>
	``The file is indeed very lengthy and much of it is now over 75  
years old,'' Selig wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson spent 13 years in the major leagues and batted .356, the  
third highest career figure in baseball history. 
</P>
<P>
	Others who have backed Jackson's reinstatement, including Hall  
of Fame members Ted Williams and Bob Feller, have noted there was 
no evidence Jackson tried to throw the Series. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson died in 1951.

<HEADLINE> Bowman To Return As Red Wings Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Scotty Bowman will return to coach the Detroit  
Red Wings, a source said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowman, 65, and Red Wings general manager Ken Holland were  
expected to make the announcement Friday in a joint teleconference 
with reporters, but a league source confirmed that Bowman intends 
to stay on. 
</P>
<P>
	Bowman appeared to be leaning toward remaining behind the bench  
shortly after Detroit was eliminated in six games by Colorado in 
the second round of this season's playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of pluses to coming back and a few minuses,''  
Bowman said then. ``You want to make sure. It would be nice to 
coach in the year 2000. I'm just intrigued. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as coaching in five decades, it's more of a thrill the  
first time to do it. It's the satisfaction of staying in the 
game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bowman, the most successful coach in NHL history, has a  
1,100-516-284 regular season mark and a 204-116 playoff record, 
winning five Stanley Cups with Montreal, two with Detroit and one 
with Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	His eight Cup championships equals former Montreal Canadiens  
coach Toe Blake for the most in NHL history.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Medal of Honor Winners Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Nearly 100 Medal of Honor winners gathered  
on Friday for the unveiling of the first monument recognizing the 
more than 3,400 recipients of America's highest distinction for 
military valor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Medal of Honor Memorial consists of 27 bluish-green, curved  
glass panels that rise above the canal that splits downtown 
Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	The veterans got their first chance Friday to walk among those  
walls, during a dedication ceremony at which speaker after speaker 
dubbed the former soldiers as the 20th century's greatest heroes. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wear these medals, not for ourselves, but for those who  
served with us and whose work went unseen,'' said Paul Bucha, who 
earned the medal while serving in the Army in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
	The panels bear the names of all Medal of Honor winners from 15  
military conflicts dating to the Civil War, with their branch of 
service and the site of their heroic deeds. 
</P>
<P>
	Every night at dusk, a sound system will play recorded stories,  
narrated by the servicemen who hold the star-shaped medallions. 
</P>
<P>
	IPALCO Enterprises Inc., a holding company for the electrical  
utility that serves Indianapolis, spent $2.5 million to build the 
memorial. It also paid to bring to Indianapolis as many of the 160 
surviving Medal of Honor recipients as possible for the dedication 
over Memorial Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just ordinary men and we were very fortunate to do deeds  
that were seen,'' said Stephen Gregg, 84, of Bayonne, N.J., who 
dodged gunfire and grenades to give cover to a medic who rescued 
seven wounded soldiers in World War II France. 
</P>
<P>
	IPALCO chairman John Hodowal got the idea for the memorial from  
these stories after learning that there was no monument to the 
heroics of those who won the Medal of Honor. 
</P>
<P>
	The honored veterans will ride in the Indianapolis 500 Festival  
Parade on Saturday and take a spin around Indianapolis Motor 
Speedway before Sunday's big race. 
</P>
<P>
	Clyde Choate, 78, of Anna, Ill., brought two grandsons to see  
the memorial. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's probably hundreds of thousands of members of the armed  
Ffrces that did equally as much as we few have done,'' said Choate, 
an Army staff sergeant who single-handedly destroyed an enemy tank 
in France during World War II. ``But they were never recognized for 
it.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Says He's For Gun Show Checks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- George W. Bush says he's for instant checks at  
gun shows, but he let legislation on the issue die in Texas. He 
says the subject ``needs to be worked out'' in Washington -- then 
opposes the solution passed by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	What looks at first to be a Texas-sized flip flop is instead an  
example of how Bush speaks in vague terms with versatile words that 
don't pin him down on a contentious issue. It is an age-old 
political skill that President Clinton turned into an art form. 
</P>
<P>
	From abortion to Kosovo to gun control, hate crimes, affirmative  
action and the environment, the front-running Republican 
presidential contender uses precisely imprecise language to leave 
himself wiggle room. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think comparisons to Clinton can be strained in some major  
ways, but in small areas like careful word choice and artful policy 
positions, they both show political deftness and skill of a similar 
sort,'' said Bruce Buchanan, professor of government at the 
University of Texas, a presidential specialist who has watched 
Bush's career up close. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor's supporters don't like the comparison.  
</P>
<P>
	``Governor Bush exercises responsible leadership -- leadership  
that seeks to unify people and find common ground rather than pit 
people against one another,'' spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He states his position clearly and responsibly. Some media and  
Democrats want to try to goad him into saying what he's against. 
But Governor Bush wants people to know what he is for,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said in May he is for a constitutional amendment to make  
abortion illegal -- just what the conservative wing of his party 
wanted to hear. 
</P>
<P>
	In the same interview, he said Americans' ``hearts are not  
right'' on the issue, thus concluding that there is no sense in 
pushing for an amendment opposed by many moderate voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Affirmative action is another issue that divides the left from  
right. With three squishy sentences in April, Bush seemed to oppose 
and support it. ``I'm for affirmative access. I think the state 
ought to do everything in its power to provide equal opportunity 
for all citizens. I think quotas put one group of people against 
another.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Kosovo, Bush criticized Clinton for taking a ground invasion  
off the table, but when asked whether he would deploy troops he 
deftly dodged. ``That's dependent upon the military advisers that 
would be advising me,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He did make one thing perfectly clear: ``I support winning.''  
</P>
<P>
	He wouldn't take a position on a hate crimes bill in the Texas  
legislature, yet stood firm against hate and crime. ``All crime is 
a hate crime,'' he said in May. 
</P>
<P>
	This self-styled compassionate conservative defends his  
environmental record, but has waffled on global warming. 
</P>
<P>
	--''I think the science is still out on issues like global  
warming,'' he said in March. 
</P>
<P>
	--''I believe there is global warming,'' he said May 13.  
</P>
<P>
	He noted still later, a ``number of conservative people ...  
disagree about its cause and impact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the aftermath of the school shootings in Littleton, Colo.,  
Bush said he supported a Republican proposal for voluntary 
background checks at gun shows but wanted Washington to go farther 
and make the checks mandatory. The GOP measure failed. 
</P>
<P>
	When Vice President Al Gore cast the tie-breaking vote to pass  
the Democratic alternative -- with sponsors saying it provides for 
mandatory checks -- Bush refused at first to say whether he 
supported it. 
</P>
<P>
	He limited his reaction to the defeated GOP version, which he  
said was stricter than the Democratic measure. ``My vice president, 
I suspect, would have helped make sure'' the GOP measure passed, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I suspect'' is a word Clinton likes to use to leave himself an  
out. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor summed up Bushspeak best himself, answering  
queries about a tough topic in 1998: ``Those are all questions that 
have to be answered given the context of the moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The context of the moment can yield answers from Bush that seem  
a shade or two different from his previous responses. It might be 
that his opinion has changed, but more often than not it boils down 
to this: He never really made his opinion clear in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
	Buchanan said Bush, like Clinton, carefully selects his words to  
leave room to maneuver around political landmines. Both men seek to 
bridge the gap between the old rhetoric of the right and left. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's irritating to purists, but it's definitely the art of the  
possible and creative ambiguity. And it is a valued political 
skill,'' he said. ``Given the way our system works, it's a 
necessary one.''

<HEADLINE> Longer Trading Approved for Nasdaq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Television networks will have some outside  
competition for their fall lineups: stock trading during prime 
time. 
</P>
<P>
	Come autumn, investors could be buying and selling shares of  
Microsoft Corp. and 99 other companies on the Nasdaq Stock Market 
while watching Friends or Ally McBeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association of Securities Dealers, which governs  
Nasdaq, on Thursday approved a plan to extend trading hours from 
the current 9:30 a.m.-4 p.m. Eastern time schedule. A second 
session of the day would likely start at 5:30 p.m. and end at 9 
p.m. or 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The changes are expected to take effect around September, after  
a review by the Securities and Exchange Commission and discussions 
with industry leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``This business of extended hours is a serious market-quality  
question, and it needs to be addressed with a great deal of 
seriousness,'' said Frank Zarb, chairman and chief executive of the 
National Association of Securities Dealers. 
</P>
<P>
	The SEC has been urging restraint, proposing a delay until next  
year so that the securities industry would not be extending trading 
hours at the same time it is confronting the Year 2000 computer bug 
and preparing to shift from reporting stock prices in fractions to 
the use of decimals. 
</P>
<P>
	But Zarb said Nasdaq is still sticking with its plans for  
starting night trading around September. 
</P>
<P>
	State securities regulators recognize the increased demand by  
investors, but are concerned that risky, short-term investors may 
get into trouble buying and selling stocks in the evening when 
trading is light and prices can be more volitile. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're now a nation of stockholders and the markets are  
reacting to that by offering convenience -- just as banks did by 
extending hours and installing ATMs,'' said Marc Beauchamp, a 
spokesman for the North American Securities Administrators 
Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's hope longer trading days won't encourage more 'day  
trading' by Main Street investors, who ought to be in the market 
for the long term,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The groundbreaking decision, which could throw many Wall Street  
companies into chaos, is being made to accommodate the growing 
number of investors who trade at home over the Internet. But the 
securities industry, especially smaller firms, will have to find 
ways for brokers and backroom recordkeepers to accommodate the 
nighttime business. 
</P>
<P>
	In a poll for the CNBC financial cable news channel, 53 percent  
of active investors 21 years of age or older liked the idea of 
trading well into the evening, while 31 percent opposed the move. 
The poll of more than 500 people and had a margin of error of plus 
or minus 4.4 percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, trading would be limited to Nasdaq's 100 largest,  
nonfinancial companies, led by Microsoft and including such other 
well-known stocks as Intel Corp., Northwest Airlines Corp. and MCI 
WorldCom Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks would still have a final, closing price reported at the 4  
p.m. end of the daytime session. Any after-hour trades would count 
toward the following day's stock price. 
</P>
<P>
	Securities subject to stock splits, or stock dividends would be  
suspended from trading in the evening session. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are calling on the industry to do the right thing, to  
coordinate and be responsible and move in unison so the investor 
can be properly protected in the new world of extended hours,'' 
Zarb said. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement after the vote, SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt said  
the SEC supports ``investor choice in trading hours. Before 
widespread trading begins outside of regular hours, however, a 
number of investor protection and market integrity issues need to 
be addressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those issues include broad distribution of stock price data and  
the capacity of computer systems to handle the trading load. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange  
said the Big Board also is considering a plan to extend its trading 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the traditional markets are facing increased competition  
from overseas exchanges, which often trade shares of U.S.-based 
companies, and from alternative computer-based exchanges in the 
United States and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Zarb acknowledged that he has been approached by New  
York city and state officials about moving into part of the new 
facility that is being built for the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have looked at it and we have asked them for more  
information,'' he said, but added, ``Based upon what we know now, 
it's not our favorite option by a longshot.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- A woman who allegedly knocked an  
elderly neighbor to the ground and mooned her for not responding to 
her ``good afternoon'' was charged with murder after the victim had 
a heart attack and died. 
</P>
<P>
	Joelle O'Neill, 41, got angry at Julia Osmun, 65, on Sept. 16,  
authorities said. Ms. O'Neill, who is black, and Ms. Osmun, who was 
white, also exchanged racial slurs, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
	Minutes later, Ms. Osmun, who had a history of heart problems,  
began breathing heavily and was taken to the hospital. She died 
later that day. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. O'Neill was charged Thursday with murder. She was already in  
jail on cocaine charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The death was ruled a homicide based on studies that show the  
anxiety of a confrontation can lead to heart attacks, said 
investigator Bill Pellan. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this case there wasn't actually trauma directly leading to  
the death,'' Pellan said. ``But had she not been involved in this 
incident, she might be alive today.''

<HEADLINE> Tested Blazers vs. Rested Spurs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN ANTONIO (AP) -- San Antonio and Portland were not supposed to  
be in the conference finals when this abbreviated season began. 
Five months later, they are right where they deserve to be. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs, rested but maybe rusty, haven't played since they  
swept the Los Angeles Lakers on Sunday. The Trail Blazers go into 
Saturday's Game 1 less than 48 hours after eliminating Utah in a 
rough six-game series. 
</P>
<P>
	Young, deep and ebbing with confidence, the Blazers brushed  
aside any concern over fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's to our advantage to keep playing because of our  
youth and enthusiasm,'' the Blazers' Greg Anthony said. ``It's 
beneficial for us to keep our momentum going.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Spurs practiced Friday finally knowing their opponent. Now  
the question is whether the long layoff will sour their sweet run 
that began when they got off to a 6-8 start. Since then, counting a 
7-1 mark in the playoffs, the Spurs are 38-6. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no idea is the most honest answer,'' Spurs coach Gregg  
Popovich said when asked about the layoff. ``I don't think anybody 
has an idea. We just have to see how we look when we get out on the 
court.'' 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio beat the Blazers three out of four during the  
season, but the margin was never more than eight points, and that 
was in overtime. The Blazers believe they've learned a lot about 
poise since. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just to have gone through what we've gone through, I think  
that takes your confidence level up another notch,'' Portland coach 
Mike Dunleavy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blazers withstood all of Utah's wily tactics. Portland won a  
critical road game in Game 2, then put the series away with a 
strong finish in Thursday night's 92-80 victory at the Rose Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing San Antonio will be a similar situation to playing  
Utah,'' Portland's Jim Jackson said. ``We lost the season series 
against them, too. But we've learned some things since we last 
played them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest concern for the Blazers is the twin towers of Tim  
Duncan and David Robinson. Robinson averaged 21.3 points against 
Portland, nearly five more than his season average. Duncan added 
20.3, just below his average. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a whole lot of work ahead of us, dealing with those  
two big guys,'' Rasheed Wallace said. ``Against the Jazz, they 
really have one big guy, Karl Malone, but the Spurs have those two 
cats. ... We just have to play them tough all the time -- never let 
up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Relentless defensive pressure made the difference against Utah,  
and the Spurs expect the same treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be intense, I'm sure,'' said San Antonio's Sean  
Elliott. ``These guys have got to be riding a wave of confidence 
right now. They just beat the team that everybody picked to win the 
NBA championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Duncan has been magnificent in the first two rounds. Against the  
Lakers, he scored 25, 21, 37 and 33. He often will go up against 
Brian Grant, who shut down Malone for much of the Utah series, 
including a 3-for-17, career-playoff-low eight point game on 
Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Spurs have shown they are much more than a two-man team.  
Point guard Avery Johnson has averaged 14 points and 7.5 assists 
while shooting .527 from the floor in the postseason. Sean Elliott 
is again a big scoring threat after an off year. Mario Elie, Jerome 
Kersey and Steve Kerr give San Antonio maturity and depth. 
</P>
<P>
	Jaren Jackson, who once played for Portland, has been effective  
off the bench at off-guard and scored 20 in the Spurs' clincher 
over the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	An important matchup looms at off-guard. Isaiah Rider has backed  
up his chest-banging bravado with strong, controlled performances 
against Phoenix and Utah. He will go against Elie, one of the 
league's toughest players. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I've got the No. 1 challenge on the team, contending  
with J.R. Rider,'' Elie said. ``He's a terrific young player.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a team with eight former lottery picks, the Blazers have no  
one star player. Nine different players led the team in various 
statistical categories. All five starters have averaged double 
figures in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``They create problems all over the place,'' Popovich said.  
``They've got, it seems like, five or six people they can stick on 
the post and create mismatches for you. They're very, very deep, 
very, very talented. There will be mismatches all over the place 
and we'll have to take care of them.''

<HEADLINE> NBA Upholds Agent Decertification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An agent who harshly criticized the players'  
union during the NBA lockout will remain decertified, an arbitrator 
ruled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The ruling will keep Stephen Woods, who represented Kevin Willis  
of the Toronto Raptors, barred from negotiating player contracts. 
He said he plans to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Latrell Sprewell can get reinstated for choking his coach,  
why should I be barred from making a living?'' Woods said. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods was a vocal anti-union voice during the nearly  
seven-month-long lockout, taking numerous shots at union president 
Patrick Ewing and union director Billy Hunter over their 
negotiating strategies. 
</P>
<P>
	The union revoked his certification for not acting in its best  
interest, and Woods appealed the action before arbitrator George 
Nicolau. 
</P>
<P>
	``The discipline of decertification imposed by the disciplinary  
committee is reasonable,'' Nicolau wrote in a 47-page decision. 
</P>
<P>
	Woods also filed two complaints with the National Labor  
Relations Board, charging the union with unfair labor practices. 
Both filings were later withdrawn.

<HEADLINE> Nevada To Ban Job Bias Against Gays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARSON CITY, Nev. (AP) -- Gov. Kenny Guinn said Friday he will  
sign a bill to prohibit job discrimination against gays. 
</P>
<P>
	Guinn, the state's first Republican governor in 16 years, will  
sign the measure in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
	``The governor feels that discrimination in the workplace,  
whether in the private or the public sector, is simply wrong and 
this bill is the right thing to do,'' said Jack Finn, the 
governor's press secretary. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill calls for sexual orientation to be added to race,  
color, sex, religion and disabilities as things banned from 
discrimination in hiring, promotion and firing. Tax-exempt 
organizations, such as the Boy Scouts, are excluded from the law, 
which is to take effect Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten states and the District of Columbia have similar laws, said  
the Human Rights Campaign based in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress has not approved a similar federal law, and some  
opponents of the Nevada bill had suggested the state wait until 
Congress acts.

<HEADLINE> NTSB Wants Military Plane Grounded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A type of surplus military plane that is used  
in civilian dogfighting classes is in danger of losing its wings in 
sharp turns and should be grounded until a proper inspection can be 
developed, a federal safety panel recommended today. 
</P>
<P>
	The Beech T-34A, bought by the Air Force in 1950 and later used  
by the Navy as well, apparently is straining under the heavy 
gravity of the turns and dives that are common in ``Top Gun'' 
flying classes in which civilians engage in mock combat in planes 
flown by flight instructors. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Transportation Safety Board, in a letter to the  
Federal Aviation Administration, said such excessive ``G-loading'' 
may have caused the right wing of a T-34A to tear off on April 19 
over Rydall, Ga., sending the plane plummeting to the ground and 
killing the pilot and his passenger. The plane was operated by Sky 
Warriors Inc. of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators found extensive fatigue cracking around the wing  
and in similar areas on the left wing, which remained on the plane 
but was heavily damaged in the crash. The safety board also learned 
that cracks had been found in the lower wing spar of a T-34 
operated by Texas Air Aces of Spring, Texas, although the parts 
were replaced and discarded prior to the accident in Rydall. 
</P>
<P>
	There is at least one other air combat operator, although the  
board did not name the company. 
</P>
<P>
	While Sky Warriors asked its pilots not to engage in dives or  
rolls that created strains exceeding four times the weight of 
gravity, the safety board said a tape of the fatal flight contained 
an excerpt in which the pilot told the passenger they had just made 
a 4.5- to 5-G turn. One of Sky Warriors' T-34s reportedly exceeded 
12-G loading during one mission. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane was originally certified to 6 Gs.  
</P>
<P>
	``The safety board has found no other examples of possible  
wing-structure fatigue cracking in the long history of the T-34 
series of airplanes,'' Jim Hall, chairman of the NTSB, wrote in a 
letter to FAA Administrator Jane Garvey. 
</P>
<P>
	``The safety board believes that air combat simulation flights  
may induce a larger number of high positive wing loading events per 
hour than other operations,'' Hall added. ``Considering these 
factors, it is likely that the fatigue cracking on the accident 
airplane was the result of the loading conditions experienced 
during the air combat simulation flights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The board acknowledged that the current certificate-holder for  
the T-34, the Raytheon Aircraft Co., issued a safety communique May 
19 recommending that the planes not be flown until the FAA makes 
any decisions stemming from the recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hall said that since the action is not mandatory, the FAA  
should ``immediately restrict from further flight'' all such planes 
used in air combat simulations until an inspection can be 
developed. The safety board also said no more T-34s should enter 
combat simulation service without the future inspection. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA had no immediate comment, as is its standard practice.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've just received this,'' said agency spokeswoman Diane  
Spitaliere. ``We take all recommendations by the NTSB very 
seriously and we will give these recommendations our utmost 
consideration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A call to Sky Warriors in Atlanta was greeted with a recorded  
message saying the company was not operating pending the outcome of 
the investigation. A message left on the line seeking comment was 
not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Sky Warriors was started in 1990 by former Delta pilot Earl C.  
Arrowood. The crash killed retired Delta pilot Floyd ``Ted'' McFann 
Sr., 60, of Alpharetta, Ga., and Delta pilot Daniel Bouck, 51, of 
Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> Jets' Owner Will Filed for Probate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Leon Hess, in a will filed for probate Friday in  
Manhattan Surrogate Court, left hundreds of millions of dollars to 
friends and relatives and ordered the sale of his New York Jets 
football team. 
</P>
<P>
	The oil magnate, who died May 7 at age 85, barred any member of  
his family from buying any interest in the Jets or participating in 
the team's future, ``either directly or indirectly, in any capacity 
whatsoever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The will states that any beneficiary of Hess' estate who  
challenges the executors' sale of the Jets in any way will have his 
or her bequest reduced by 25 percent and that sum will be 
redistributed as if he or she had died. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is my intent that my interests in the Jets be disposed of  
unaffected by any desire of family members to participate in the 
club's future ownership,'' the will reads. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess recommended that his executors hire Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.,  
the investment banking firm, to manage the Jets' sale. The wish has 
already been carried out. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess also urged that team president Steve Gutman remain in  
charge and assist in the sale, and included a formula to compensate 
Gutman for his role. 
</P>
<P>
	The will gives Gutman $250,000 of the first $100 million of the  
Jets' sale price, $500,000 of the second $100 million, and $1 
million for every $100 million after that. That means that if the 
Jets are sold for $500 million -- a recent estimate of the team's 
worth -- Gutman would get $3.75 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The bulk of money from the sale is designated to pay off as much  
debt as possible. The will says Hess' interests in Amerada Hess, 
the giant oil company he headed, should be sold only as a last 
resort. 
</P>
<P>
	``I anticipate that the sale of my interest in the New York Jets  
Football Club Inc. will substantially raise the cash needs required 
by my executors to pay the debts, administration expenses and taxes 
borne by my estate,'' Hess said in the will. 
</P>
<P>
	He left the bulk of his estate to his wife, Norma Wilentz Hess,  
and made substantial bequests to his children. His daughters, 
Constance Hess Williams and Marlene Hess, get $55 million each. His 
son, John B. Hess, is bequeathed $60 million, plus $8.25 million as 
an executor of the estate. 
</P>
<P>
	Hess left $1 million to each of his grandchildren, and sums  
ranging from $50,000 to $1 million to numerous nieces, nephews, 
in-laws and friends. 
</P>
<P>
	The will also provides fees of $1.5 million for two coexecutors,  
and $1.25 million for two other coexecutors.

<HEADLINE> Furman Women's Coach Requests Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREENVILLE, S.C. (AP) -- Furman women's basketball coach Sherry  
Carter has filed a federal complaint, saying she should be paid as 
much as men's basketball coach Larry Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter said she tried in vain for 10 years to get the university  
to address her salary concerns. She also wants a multiyear 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission decides to pursue  
the complaint, it will attempt mediation, said Rosemary Fox, an 
attorney with the agency. If that fails, the case could go to 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter filed the complaint last November, but did not publicly  
discuss it until this week, The (Greenville) News reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Carter nor Furman officials would discuss specifics of  
coaches' salaries or contract lengths -- the school is private so 
such information need not be disclosed -- but Carter referred to ``a 
big pay discrepancy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I have two children, both in college, and my husband was  
killed in a car accident. So I'm a single mother,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	University spokesman Vince Moore would not comment on the  
complaint, ying it was a personnel matter. 
</P>
<P>
	``The university will continue to support coach Carter and the  
Lady Paladin basketball program as it has throughout the years,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress passed Title IX legislation 27 years ago to address  
inequities in sports programs for females. Furman underwent a Title 
IX investigation in 1991, and an NCAA review of its 1996 self-study 
concluded that no major issues needed to be addressed, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, a Chronicle of Higher Education study of  
women in college athletics said Furman spent $746,501 on salaries 
for coaches and staff working with men's teams, compared with 
$332,465 for women's teams. 
</P>
<P>
	Coaches who head women's teams in NCAA Division I-A make 63  
cents for every dollar earned by coaches who head men's teams, 
according to a Women's Sports Foundation report using 1995-96 data. 
</P>
<P>
	``The salary gap between coaches of women's and men's teams  
remains somewhat consistent across all the NCAA divisions,'' the 
report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter said that although Davis probably has more speaking  
engagements, the two follow identical NCAA rules that limit 
practice hours per week, recruiting days and days spent observing 
teams. ``The job is definitely the same,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carter has compiled a 244-219 record during her 17 years at  
Furman, compared with Davis' two-season record of 21-36.

<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- A woman was charged Friday with trying  
to sell her 8-year-old adopted Russian daughter for $4,000 through 
an e-mail. 
</P>
<P>
	Denise Kay Thomas, 42, was charged with attempted trafficking in  
children and criminal solicitation to commit trafficking in 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	In a telephone interview Friday, Mrs. Thomas said she did not  
intend to sell Elena, the girl she and her husband adopted in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she was trying to find a suitable home for Elena  
because the girl had emotional problems that were too much for her 
and her husband to overcome. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel I am innocent and will plead innocent. I don't feel  
guilty at all,'' she said. ``We want to find a good home for her, 
obviously that's our main goal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Elena has been placed in a foster home.  
</P>
<P>
	The proposed sale was uncovered May 21 when sheriff's deputies  
were contacted by a Texas couple who said they had received an 
e-mail from a woman offering to sell the girl. 
</P>
<P>
	It is illegal to sell a child and a private adoption must go  
through a licensed agency.

<HEADLINE> Shuttle Closes In on Space Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Discovery and its crew closed in on  
the international space station Friday for the first-ever docking 
between the shuttle and the new orbiting outpost. 
</P>
<P>
	The space shuttle was scheduled to arrive early Saturday with 2  
tons of gear for the 230-mile-high space station, which was 
launched last year and consists of only two rooms so far. 
</P>
<P>
	``The history of this moment shouldn't be lost on us,'' said  
Frank Culbertson, NASA deputy program manager for space station 
operations. He pronounced the docking ``a very significant event -- 
one that we're going to repeat many, many times in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Space shuttles have docked nine times with Russia's Mir station  
in recent years. But this marked the first time since Skylab in the 
mid-1970s that NASA docked with its own space station. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery will be linked to the 77-foot, 70,000-pound space  
station for nearly six days. 
</P>
<P>
	This weekend, spacewalking astronauts will attach a crane and  
other tools to the station's exterior. And the crew of seven will 
also unload spare parts, computers, tools, water and clothes for 
the station's first permanent inhabitants, who are supposed to move 
in next March. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrival of the first long-term inhabitants keeps getting  
postponed because of the Russians' inability to complete a 
component that will double as living quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the absence of the Russian component -- it should have  
gone up last year -- Saturday's docking had to be revamped. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers devised a plan in which the station's large thrusters  
would be turned off and small thrusters would be used to hold the 
station steady during Discovery's slow and cautious approach. 
</P>
<P>
	In preparation for the astronauts' arrival, controllers on the  
ground cranked up the heat toward room temperature aboard the space 
station. Normally, it is about 25 degrees when no one is there. 
</P>
<P>
	Once completed, the space station will have about a dozen rooms  
and stretch longer than a football field.

	HAVANA (AP) -- The former Communist Party youth leader once seen  
as a protege and surrogate son to Cuban President Fidel Castro was 
replaced as foreign minister Friday by an even younger man -- the 
34-year-old chief of staff who handles Castro's daily schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Castro's replacement of Roberto Robaina with Felipe Perez Roque,  
a key adviser to the president for seven years, appeared aimed at 
giving Castro tighter control over Cuba's foreign policy, which has 
become increasingly important with the Soviet Union's collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez Roque ``is familiar as few are with the ideas and thoughts  
of Fidel,'' the Communist Party daily Granma said in a front-page 
story announcing the replacement. Robaina was not openly 
criticized, but the article made clear that Castro wanted a change. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am very happy with my new duties,'' Perez Roque told  
reporters Friday as he left the ministry after a full day inside. 
``I intend to maintain the policies of my predecessor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although rumors had circulated in recent weeks that Robaina was  
going to be moved from the foreign ministry, the news surprised 
much of the political establishment. 
</P>
<P>
	As recently as Thursday afternoon, a foreign ministry spokesman  
announced that Robaina was to leave Monday for a tour of Venezuela, 
Panama and Haiti -- a trip that he will now no longer make. 
</P>
<P>
	Robaina was not seen in public Friday and issued no statements.  
</P>
<P>
	Castro's decision was seconded by the Council of State,  
controlled by Castro and comprised of the country's most powerful 
and trusted government officials, including both Robaina and Perez 
Roque. The decision was also approved by the Communist Party's top 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	It does not necessarily mean that Robaina is being moved aside.  
Robaina's predecessor, Ricardo Alarcon, went on to become president 
of the National Assembly and continues to play an important role in 
both domestic and foreign policy, especially with the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	But when Robaina was named foreign minister six years ago,  
Alarcon's new post was announced at the same time. The government 
has not said what role Robaina will now have. 
</P>
<P>
	Granma said simply that Robaina was ``freed from his position  
until a new function is assigned to him.'' It said he had ``made 
the greatest efforts to complete his job during his time in 
charge.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In what could be seen as a criticism of Robaina, the newspaper  
said Castro's choice of Perez Roque took into account ``the current 
complexity of the tense international situation, its growing 
importance for the future of our country and the world, and the 
need for more profound, rigorous, systematic and demanding work'' 
in foreign relations. 
</P>
<P>
	Cuba has suffered several diplomatic setbacks recently following  
the conviction of four of the country's best-known dissidents on 
sedition charges in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. Human Rights Commission voted narrowly last month to  
criticize Cuba's human rights record. 
</P>
<P>
	King Juan Carlos of Spain, scheduled to visit Cuba this spring,  
still has not announced a date for the visit. Diplomatic sources 
say the trip has been postponed because of human rights concerns, 
adding that the monarch may not come to Cuba until the 
Ibero-American summit in November. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign minister since 1993, Robaina has overseen the communist  
country's foreign policy during years of extreme economic hardship 
following the collapse of the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Through his almost constant travels around the world, Robaina  
has been credited with helping Cuba expand and strengthen its ties 
with many nations following the loss of its communist allies. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was appointed at age 37, Robaina was the embodiment of  
Cuba's young leadership and was said to have a father-son 
relationship with Castro. 
</P>
<P>
	A mathematics teacher by training, he was at the time the head  
of the Communist Party's youth union, a deputy to the National 
Assembly, and a member of the party's Political Bureau and the 
government's Council of State, indicating he was one of Castro's 
inner circle. 
</P>
<P>
	A casual dresser who rarely wears socks and shoves up his jacket  
sleeves, the bouncy, compact man in eyeglasses was also a bit of a 
populist, riding his bicycle to work during the most difficult 
years of Cuba's economic crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	During his brief stays in Cuba, an animated Robaina greeted  
visitors in a garden decorated with cages of tropical birds inside 
the Foreign Ministry building, one block from Havana's famous 
Malecon seawall. 
</P>
<P>
	Government sources say Perez Roque is considered serious, down  
to earth, and extremely loyal to the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Perez Roque has played numerous leadership roles over the years,  
serving as president of the Federation of University Students, a 
national director of the Communist Youth Union and a member of the 
Communist Party's Central Committee since 1991, when he was 26. 
</P>
<P>
	Since he was 21, Felipe Perez Roque has been a deputy with the  
National Assembly, Cuba's unicameral legislature. He has been a 
member of the Council of State since 1993, when he was 28.

<HEADLINE> Feds Depose Microsoft Witness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Federal prosecutors on Friday tried to  
discredit a Silicon Valley CEO who was asked by Microsoft chairman 
Bill Gates to testify on behalf of the company as part of its 
antitrust trial. 
</P>
<P>
	During six hours of testimony in a San Jose hotel, Oblix  
president Gordon Eubanks described a telephone conversation with 
Gates three to four weeks ago in which the multibillionaire 
congratulated him on his move from Symantec to Oblix. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said they would like to have someone who has been in the  
industry a long time to testify about trends and technology,'' 
Eubanks said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eubanks could not recall, when asked by prosecutor David Boies,  
whether Gates had said this purpose was to help ``control damage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eubanks also said he hadn't discussed the testimony of others or  
specific topics to testify that would be favorable to Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	During the sometimes tense questioning from Boies, Eubanks said  
that over the past several years, Microsoft executives had asked 
him to speak to reporters about industry issues on behalf of 
Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
	Eubanks admitted that an op-ed article about Microsoft with his  
name on it was actually written by a spokesperson for Symantec and 
reviewed by his company's lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	But he defended the article, saying, ``I have a dear belief that  
if it had my name on it, they were words that I wanted to say about 
the subject.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Department of Justice and 19 states accuse Microsoft of  
crushing competitors by illegally wielding the power of its 
dominant Windows computer operating system to expand into new 
markets, such as Internet software. 
</P>
<P>
	Eubanks was the final of three witnesses deposed before the  
rebuttal phase of the trial resumes Tuesday in Washington after a 
13-week recess. 
</P>
<P>
	Department of Justice witness Edward Felten, a computer expert,  
was deposed Wednesday in Washington and IBM executive Garry Norris, 
who will testify against Microsoft, was deposed Thursday in North 
Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Eubanks stepped down in January as president and chief executive  
of Symantec Corp., which makes a popular anti-virus program and 
other software utilities that run using Microsoft's Windows 
operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	A longtime Microsoft ally, Eubanks left to become president of  
Oblix Inc., a small computer automation company whose investors 
include Netscape and Novell Inc. -- some of Microsoft's biggest 
rivals. 
</P>
<P>
	``Microsoft has done some bad things,'' Eubanks told The New  
York Times last year. But he added that Microsoft's chairman, Bill 
Gates, is a victim of American culture's trend of attacking and 
tearing down successful people. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft will use Eubanks' success at Symantec to try to  
explain to the trial judge that Microsoft routinely adds new 
functions to its Windows operating system and that those actions 
are not necessarily anticompetitive. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think his testimony will show the incredible competition  
that exists throughout the software industry, and the benefits of 
Microsoft's continued evolution of the operating system for 
consumers,'' Microsoft spokesman Mark Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
	Antitrust attorney Richard Gray, who is closely following the  
Microsoft case, said it would be difficult for Eubank's testimony 
about the industry to undercut the government's case, if indeed the 
proof is there that the computer giant did indeed have an illegal 
monopoly.

<HEADLINE> Owner To Decide Fate of Chief Wahoo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Walter Goldbach didn't mean to anger anyone  
when he first sketched out the caricature of a grinning, big-nosed 
Indian brave. 
</P>
<P>
	It was 1946. Goldbach was a 17-year-old working at his uncle's  
emblem company, trying to come up with a snazzy logo for the 
Cleveland Indians baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
	But more than 50 years since Goldbach's handiwork became Chief  
Wahoo -- the face stitched in to every Cleveland player's cap -- the 
symbol has become a source of tension, loved by fans but reviled by 
American Indian activists who consider it degrading and racist. 
</P>
<P>
	Sports marketers believe the logo will present a tough problem  
if Indians owner Richard Jacobs follows through on his plan to sell 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The owner will face this choice: give in to protesters' demands  
and change the team logo -- even its name -- and take the resulting 
heat from fans, or keep the logo and be seen in some circles as 
insensitive. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new owner will be in a huge pressure cooker with regard to  
how loud people will scream about this,'' said Brandon Steiner, who 
heads a sports marketing company in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldbach, now a retired sign designer who lives in the outer  
Cleveland suburbs, said he probably was influenced by the cartoon 
style of the day when he first drew Wahoo for then-new Indians 
owner Bill Veeck. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last thing on my mind was trying to offend anybody,''  
Goldbach said. 
</P>
<P>
	Through the years, his original design has been fine-tuned.  
</P>
<P>
	Wahoo's face -- originally a sort of orange-brown -- is now red. A  
pony tail has been shorn, and Wahoo's nose has been shortened and 
straightened. The Indians use just the Wahoo head in promotional 
material now, not a full-body figure that was sometimes shown 
through the years. 
</P>
<P>
	Goldbach said he never heard any complaints about the logo until  
about 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	More recently, anti-Wahoo protests have become a fixture outside  
Jacobs Field on opening day and during the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year and in 1997, demonstrators were arrested for burning  
Wahoo in effigy. Protesters have sued the city, charging that 
police harassed them and violated their right to free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacobs has consistently said he won't change the logo, but a new  
owner might have a harder time holding that position. 
</P>
<P>
	Vernon Bellecourt, president of the National Coalition on Racism  
in Sports and Media and one of those who has been arrested, said 
the ownership change would be a perfect time ``to cleanse the 
national pastime of institutional racism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bellecourt wants major league baseball to hold a nationwide  
contest to give the Cleveland team a new nickname and logo. He 
thinks the interest from that would increase sales of clothing and 
other items with the Cleveland logo, while making Wahoo a 
collectors' item. 
</P>
<P>
	But the profits from apparel sales are split among all the major  
league clubs, and right now the Indians rank fifth among baseball's 
30 teams. Only the New York Yankees, St. Louis Cardinals, Atlanta 
Braves and Chicago Cubs sell more. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have a hot market in Cleveland,'' Steiner said.  
</P>
<P>
	Complicating matters further, the Indians also are performing  
well on the field. They have the best record in baseball, and sales 
of Wahoo-related gear probably would get even better if Cleveland 
won its first World Series since 1948, shortly after it adopted the 
logo. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a sports marketing standpoint, this is what you live and  
die for,'' Steiner said. ``You wait for the big win, then you take 
that logo and you go crazy with it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steiner has a hard time imagining major league baseball allowing  
the Indians to change logos even for a few years. 
</P>
<P>
	Fans also would be unhappy.  
</P>
<P>
	Louis Colombo, a local attorney, might have stated their  
position best in a letter he wrote in The Plain Dealer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The beauty of the game of baseball is its timelessness and  
tradition, and the way those elements connect generations,'' he 
said. ``The name and the logo are at the heart of that tradition in 
Cleveland.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Lee Berke, a Cleveland native and the senior vice president  
of marketing for The Marquee Group, said he can still imagine a new 
owner using the script ``Indians'' exclusively and dumping Wahoo. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted the influence of a trademark panel's recent decision to  
revoke the Washington Redskins' federal trademark protection, and 
schools dropping their Indians-related nicknames. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an issue that's not going away,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Wahoo's creator says he doesn't care if the logo  
stays or goes. To Goldbach, it's just a drawing he made as a 
teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they have a problem with it, why don't they get a bunch of  
Native American artists and have a contest between them to come up 
with a new logo?'' he asked. ``Does that sound fair?''

<HEADLINE> Dealing With Summer Money Stresses / On the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- For most households, summertime means relaxation  
and fun, but it easily can turn into one of the most financially 
stressful times of year. 
</P>
<P>
	Added expenses for vacations, camp, pool memberships or clothing  
can dismantle any family budget, particularly those unprepared for 
such seasonal bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Money can slip away faster through theft or carelessness --  
thieves prey on unsuspecting tourists; vacationers are more 
careless with personal possessions when traveling in strange 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many people don't plan well,'' said Paul Richard, executive  
vice president of the National Center for Financial Education in 
San Diego. ``Vacation time is the No. 2 time of the year, preceded 
by Christmas, where people are likely to go into debt on their 
credit cards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The National Foundation for Consumer Credit in Silver Spring,  
Md., says its 1,500 credit counseling offices around the country 
see an increase in activity during the fall months, as bills for 
summer purchases begin to mount. 
</P>
<P>
	And to make matters worse, those extra bills usually come as  
back-to-school expenses set in. Just around the corner are the 
holidays. 
</P>
<P>
	``The pattern is all too common,'' said Jonathan Pond, a Boston  
financial adviser and author of several personal finance books. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers can easily stay mired in debt throughout the year  
unless they set aside some money to handle nonrecurring expenses 
like vacations, holiday gifts, insurance or property taxes, to name 
just a few. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you add all of those up, it can easily be 15- to 20 percent  
of your income,'' Pond said. 
</P>
<P>
	He and other financial advisers suggest setting up a separate  
interest-bearing account, like a money market account or money 
market mutual fund, to be used only for such expenses. The fund 
could even be started with this year's tax refund check. (By 
mid-May, MMAs were yielding around 2.5 percent, while money funds 
were yielding around 4.3 percent. Interest-bearing checking 
accounts were yielding around 1.5 percent.) 
</P>
<P>
	``Putting aside even a few dollars a week will help,'' said  
Richard. ``You have to plan on spending a minimum of $100 a person 
per day'' during a vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	Regardless of whether they can afford it, though, most people  
feel compelled to take off between Memorial Day and Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Americans plan to take a record 271 million trips this  
summer, 4 percent more than last year, the Travel Industry 
Association of America recently reported. The average cost for 
their longest pleasure trip: $956. 
</P>
<P>
	For many households -- roughly a quarter, according to a Gallup  
poll conducted last year -- the credit card will be used to pay for 
part or all of a summer vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	Using a card does have many advantages: If you're traveling  
overseas, it often provides the best exchange rates, plus it offers 
buyer protection and protection against fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's a problem, they (card issuers) can run interference  
for their customers to help resolve their problems,'' noted 
Richard. 
</P>
<P>
	Choose a card with the lowest interest rate, though. The  
national average on a fixed-rate standard card is 13.20 percent -- 
that's lower than the 14.3 percent average for a personal loan, 
according to Bank Rate Monitor in West Palm Beach, Fla. The general 
rule of thumb: Plan on paying off vacation-related bills between 
three and five months after they arrive. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last thing in the world you want to do is go into hock the  
next few months for a vacation,'' said Pond. 
</P>
<P>
	If you'll be relying heavily on debit cards or automated teller  
machines, it's important to keep daily tallies of expenses and 
copies of bills and receipts. Like credit cards, they too provide 
the good exchange rates for overseas travelers. 
</P>
<P>
	But heavy ATM users need to be aware of fees. About  
three-quarters of all banks charge non-customers a fee ranging from 
50 cents to $3 to use their ATMs, according to a recent Bank Rate 
Monitor survey. In addition, 88 percent of banks charge their own 
customers a fee averaging $1.30 for using another institution's 
ATM, the survey found. 
</P>
<P>
	Even higher fees come on cash advances on credit cards. Not only  
might customers be subject to ATM surcharges, but they often face a 
transaction fee, ranging from 2 percent to 4 percent of the amount 
dispensed, and interest charges that begin immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial advisers say it's important to prepare a budget for  
the summer, listing extra expenses, from pet-sitting to amusement 
park fees. If the total adds up to more than you can afford, look 
for ways to trim costs. 
</P>
<P>
	If you can be flexible about vacation plans, you can save a  
bundle. A few airlines reduce fares for night flights, or offer 
discounts for stays through the weekend. Airfare also may vary from 
one airport to another, so consider driving part of the way and 
flying the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	Being creative helps. House swap with another family or take  
short trips to nearby locations.

<HEADLINE> Navy May Oppose Shipbuilding Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- The likely government rejection of Litton  
Industries Inc.'s $1.3 billion bid for Newport News Shipbuilding 
could signal an end to Newport News' own plans to purchase shipyard 
Avondale Industries Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense Secretary William Cohen said Friday that the Pentagon  
will probably tell the Justice Department to reject the 
Litton-Newport News bid for anti-competitive reasons. But Cohen 
said the Navy had determined it would not oppose the 
California-based Litton's $500 million cash offer for Avondale 
Industries Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	And that, analysts predicted, could mean the end of the  
previously agreed upon merger between Newport News and the New 
Orleans-based Avondale. Newport News had proposed a $470 million 
stock swap. 
</P>
<P>
	``Newport News is going to have to face life, at least for the  
moment, as an independent company,'' said Tom Burnett, founder of 
Merger Insight, an institutional research service in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors apparently agreed, sending shares of Newport News  
plunging $5.25, or 16 percent, to $27.25 in trading on the New York 
Stock Exchange Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Litton rose $2.43 3/4 to $65.18 3/4 on the NYSE, while  
shares of Avondale rose 25 cents to $36.50 on the Nasdaq Stock 
Market. 
</P>
<P>
	An Avondale spokesman said the company had not decided which bid  
it favors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are still closely studying both companies' proposals,''  
said Ed Winter, a spokesman for the New Orleans-based Avondale, 
which builds auxiliary and amphibious ships. 
</P>
<P>
	The possibility of future shipyard mergers is in doubt, Burnett  
and other analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Litton-Newport News merger was ``probably the last  
opportunity for significant consolidation in the navy shipbuilding 
industry,'' said Chris Hellman, senior analyst with the Center for 
Defense Information, a Pentagon watchdog group in Washington. 
``There are a finite number of combinations you can have with six 
shipyards.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hellman noted that Litton and Newport News don't compete  
directly for Navy business. Newport News is the Navy's only builder 
of nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, while Litton's Ingalls 
shipbuilding unit in Pascagoula, Miss., makes destroyers. 
</P>
<P>
	But consolidation in the defense industry has been so rapid in  
the last five years that ``the military is at this point very leery 
about additional mergers,'' Hellman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen told reporters in Washington that the Navy made a  
``preliminary determination'' that Litton's bid for Newport News 
would excessively limit competition in naval shipbuilding. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked whether the Navy's preliminary determination was likely to  
be the final decision by the Pentagon, Cohen replied, ``In this 
particular case, that probably is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Litton-Newport News deal would have reduced the number of  
companies competing to build most classes of Navy warships from 
three to two. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy is concerned that the merger would jeopardize the  
hundreds of millions of dollars in cost savings it negotiated with 
Newport News after a failed takeover bid earlier this year by 
defense contractor General Dynamics Corp., said a Navy official, 
speaking on the condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Litton made its bids for Avondale and Newport News this month  
after Cohen rejected General Dynamics' offer for Newport News in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
	Litton spokesman Randy Belote would not comment if the company  
would withdraw its offer for Newport News. Litton had proposed an 
all-stock deal, plus it would have assumed $600 million in Newport 
News' debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Litton was aware regulators might not approve the merger because  
of concern that cost savings might not offset the effects of 
reduced competition, Belote said. 
</P>
<P>
	Litton is continuing to negotiate with Avondale to try to reach  
an agreement, he added.	   ''We said from the beginning that these proposals were separate 
and independent from each other,'' Belote said. ``There was always 
that possibility that one would occur and not the other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Newport News spokesman Mike Hatfield said the shipyard is  
maintaining a neutral position on the Litton bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``We said at the time it was announced that we would certainly  
entertain any offer that came from Litton to determine whether it 
was in the best interest of our shareholders,'' Hatfield said. 
``That's still the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatfield said Newport News' merger agreement with Avondale was  
still in place, but that the agreement allows Avondale to consider 
other offers.

<HEADLINE> Mike Myers Always Favored Comedies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Yeah, baby. Even as a boy growing up in Canada,  
Mike Myers always wanted to write and act in comedies. 
</P>
<P>
	``I liked how the house felt when a good comedy was on,'' says  
the star of the upcoming sequel, ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who 
Shagged Me.'' ``I liked the feeling of a room laughing. My dad was 
a big laugher.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His father would wake him up in the middle of the night to watch  
Peter Sellers comedies, he says in the latest Rolling Stone 
magazine. Myers says Sellers influenced his comedy. 
</P>
<P>
	He also says that a line from the play ``Equus'' describes his  
work ethic: ``Relentlessly self-improving working class.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very proud of that aspect of my family life,'' he says.  
``The belief that you can do better, that you're your own keeper of 
your station in life. My parents had a great marriage, and they 
kept a really happy house where comedy and a sense of humor about 
stuff was really important.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About being Canadian, Myers says: ``Canada is the existence of  
not being. Not English, not American. ... We're more like celery as 
a flavor.''

<HEADLINE> Car Haulers Might Go On Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- A threatened Teamsters strike against the  
nation's car haulers next week could put the brakes on the auto 
industry's record sales pace, hurting automakers who depend on the 
big-rig drivers to get cars and hot-selling sport utility vehicles 
to dealers' showrooms. 
</P>
<P>
	So far this year, U.S. sales of new cars and light trucks are up  
9 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The showdown is the first test for James P. Hoffa since he  
became president of the union in March, assuming a post once held 
by his late father, Jimmy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The industry is making big money. It's time the owners shared  
the profits with the people doing the hard work,'' Hoffa has said. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiators are working against a deadline of 12:01 a.m.  
Tuesday, when the contract expires. Earlier this month, the 
truckers voted 5,705 to 251 to give their negotiating committee the 
power to call a strike if talks fail. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the moment of negotiations when one never knows,''  
said Ian Hunter, of the National Automobile Transporters Labor 
Division, among the management organizations involved in the 
negotiations. ``But we're still talking, we're still seeking a 
mutual solution.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though Hunter said he is optimistic, he said negotiations are  
intense. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is fair to say there are a number of major issues  
unresolved,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Teamsters are seeking improved pensions, higher wages, a  
reduction in ``excessive work hours'' and improved health care. 
They also say they oppose proposals for a wage scale that provides 
lower salaries to entry-level drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our drivers are the highest paid in the trucking industry,''  
Hunter said. ``The average driver wage last year was $68,000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, he said, automakers are pressuring for lower prices  
and labor costs have gone up 33 percent in the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We recognize our work force is a very diverse and capable  
group. They earn their keep. But at the same time they have to 
realize we're facing this competition,'' Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Teamsters contract covers about 12,000 drivers, mechanics,  
yard and office workers nationwide. If a strike were called, 
industry officials expect the Teamsters initially would target just 
one of the major trucking companies that contract with automakers 
to move new cars and trucks to dealers from assembly plants, ports 
and rail yards. 
</P>
<P>
	``The auto industry will certainly feel it. It depends on how  
long it lasts,'' said Howard Foster, professor of industrial 
relations at State University of New York. ``It's distressing to 
the car companies now because ... they're in the middle of a banner 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``(But) I don't see it as an event that will bring the republic  
to its knees.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Automakers likely would use their own drivers and hire  
independents to help get some vehicles to dealers in the event of a 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're monitoring the situation closely,'' said Ford Motor Co.  
spokesman Ron Iori. ``We're hoping both the Teamsters and the 
haulers can reach a mutually agreeable situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said the automaker has a contingency plan, but how it would  
be carried out would depend on the nature of a possible strike. 
</P>
<P>
	Teamsters spokesman Chip Roth said Friday that the union would  
have the option to strike on some or all of the 17 trucking 
companies that are at the negotiating table. He said he couldn't 
say which option the union would choose. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to assess that continuously as we go through the  
negotiations,'' Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
	A likely target is Allied Holdings Inc., the largest of the  
trucking companies. Based in Decatur, Ga., Allied operates about 
5,200 car- and truck-hauling rigs from 120 terminals in the United 
States and Canada, and serves all the domestic and foreign 
automakers with North American plants. It handles about two-thirds 
of the U.S. car-hauling market.

<HEADLINE> Dancing Graduates' Diplomas Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- One boy did a version of Michael  
Jackson's famous ``moonwalk'' dance, gliding backward across the 
stage. Another shimmied and shook his rump. 
</P>
<P>
	Sound like a hip party? Try a high school graduation ceremony.  
</P>
<P>
	And now, the six graduates of Ruskin High School are in hot  
water for apparently expressing a little too much joy at receiving 
their diplomas at graduation. 
</P>
<P>
	District officials are holding the students' diplomas until they  
perform 10 hours of community service. 
</P>
<P>
	The acts qualified as ``disorderly conduct'' that violated the  
graduation plan signed by each of the school's 162 graduates before 
the ceremony Tuesday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ceremony was going fine,'' said Hickman Hills School  
District spokesman Gary Martasin. ``As soon as the first student 
acted different, then it started. It's a snowball effect that we 
have to guard against. The next thing you know, you've lost 
control.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But not everyone agrees with the district's reaction. One parent  
has contacted the American Civil Liberties Union of Kansas and 
Western Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Kurtenbach, ACLU executive director, said it was an  
interesting case. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a civil liberties issue involved in the freedom of  
expression,'' Kurtenbach said. ``I think the school would be 
hard-pressed to say that the act disrupted the ceremony.''

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Prepares for New Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- Bouncing to the blare of 1950's doo-wop  
hits, cleaners and construction crews made final preparations 
Friday on the parade grounds where Nigeria's military rulers will 
hand over power to the first civilian government in 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	While technicians testing the sound system played ``Bye Bye  
Love'' and ``At the Hop,'' twin 20-foot-high television screens 
played silent Spice Girls videos. 
</P>
<P>
	Teen-agers scrubbing the bright red carpet where the  
inauguration ceremony of President-elect Olusegun Obasanjo will 
take place wiggled to the music. Others hung decorative ribbons, 
tied balloons and mopped the floor of the glassed-encased area 
where top officials will watch the handover. 
</P>
<P>
	Politicians and celebrities from South African President Nelson  
Mandela to Britain's Prince Charles will watch as Gen. Abdulsalami 
Abubakar relinquishes power -- bringing to an end a peaceful 
yearlong transition that began with the sudden death last June of 
Gen. Sani Abacha, whose wanton corruption and brutality crippled 
Nigeria and left it an international pariah. 
</P>
<P>
	For the dozens of Nigerians watching the show through a  
chain-link fence, it was all just in time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nigeria will try to restore tomorrow our economic life, our  
political life, our social life,'' said Owolaei Lawal, a civil 
servant taking a break to watch. ``Nigeria has become a dead 
nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abubakar welcomed the ``profound achievement'' of the democratic  
transition, and on Friday urged the incoming politicians to govern 
well. Nigeria has been ruled by the military for all but 10 years 
since it gained independence in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
	As a parting gesture, Abubakar also announced that the junta had  
repealed the hated decree 2, which allowed imprisonment without 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``To us all beckons the historic opportunity to break, once and  
for all, the cycle of instability and mistrust that have wracked 
our political life since independence,'' he said in a nationally 
broadcast speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Obasanjo, who won February's presidential elections, faces a  
wealth of problems in Africa's most populous nation, which is rich 
in oil but has been dragged down by years of neglect, corruption 
and mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
	Local phone calls are often impossible to place and lights can  
stay out in many Nigerian neighborhoods for weeks at a time. 
Unemployment is at staggering levels, and the people of the Niger 
Delta -- the swampy region that provides Nigeria with its oil wealth 
-- live in isolated towns with no electricity, roads or schools. 
They have seen few benefits from the oil they live above, and 
violence has rocked the Delta repeatedly in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
	Nigeria, which should have been able to use its billions in oil  
revenues to grow, instead has withered. 
</P>
<P>
	Abuja, Nigeria's always-under-construction capital city, is a  
grid of skyscrapers and boxy, modern office blocks, while much of 
Nigeria still lives in mud homes. Lagos, the country's main city, 
is a jumble of walled-in compounds for the wealthy and sprawling 
slums of staggering poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	But Obasanjo, who 20 years ago became the first -- and until  
Saturday, the only -- Nigerian military leader to voluntarily give 
up power, insists he will bring Nigeria back from economic 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	He has promised repeatedly to stop the corruption that has  
hobbled this nation of 120 million and to end the stifling poverty 
that most Nigerians endure. He says he will attract investors to 
Nigeria, most of whom have been frightened away by the crumbling 
infrastructure and rampant corruption.

<HEADLINE> Iditarod No Longer in the Red </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASILLA, Alaska (AP) -- A half-dozen years ago, the Iditarod  
Trail Sled Dog Race faced major money problems as pressure from 
animal rights groups caused two national sponsors to withdraw. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the race is turning a profit and the purse this year was  
more than $500,000 -- the biggest ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Alaska's own business community stepped in when Timberland Co.  
and Iams Co., a specialty dog food maker, dropped sponsorships that 
represented about a quarter of the Iditarod's budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``The race really depicts a lot of the state, especially in  
wintertime when there is a special beauty,'' said Dick Westlund, a 
vice president of General Communications Inc., an Alaska telephone 
and cable company that put more than $50,000 into the race this 
year. ``And when you take a step back, it helps support the state 
economy because of the focus that Alaska gets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Alaska businesses provide most of the sponsorship cash and  
``in-kind'' help that ranges from trail food to raffle prizes. 
There are also national sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're proud of our relationship with the Iditarod,'' said Joe  
Arterburn of Cabela's Inc., a Nebraska clothing retailer which came 
up with more than $150,000 in cash and gear for the race this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do a lot of business in Alaska. The Iditarod represents a  
lot of tradition and pride -- it's something we understand and 
appreciate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsors put up more than $650,000 last year in cash and nearly  
$1.3 million in merchandise and services. That's well above 1994's 
figure, the last year that Timberland and Iams were included. 
</P>
<P>
	The cash figure still lags, though. In 1994, sponsorship cash  
totaled $712,104, including $218,200 from Timberland and $150,000 
from Iams. 
</P>
<P>
	A change is financial strategy is largely responsible for  
freeing the Iditarod from its dependence on a few big sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	Sponsorships now provide only about a fourth of the total cash  
revenues of nearly $2.4 million. Raffles now bring in about the 
same amount, and the ``Iditarider'' program raised $97,000 during 
this year's race. 
</P>
<P>
	Iditariders purchase seats in mushers' sleds for the ceremonial  
start in Anchorage. The program has attracted celebrities, 
including soap opera star Susan Lucci and actor Gary Collins. 
</P>
<P>
	Other fund-raising efforts have fizzled, though.  
</P>
<P>
	The Alaska Legislature approved special legislation to allow a  
lottery based on the Iditarod, but the program lost $60,000 for the 
race in 1997 and was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	The race's financial low point was 1997, when lottery losses,  
low merchandise sales and a purse increase sent the race $110,000 
into the red. The Iditarod considered mortgaging its headquarters 
building that year, but eventually got a line of credit. And the 
board tightened its belt. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like were going to be in the black this year,'' said  
John Handeland of Nome, a longtime Iditarod board member. ``We've 
had some new sponsors come on board, and the board has looked at 
expenses more carefully. The combination of both has resulted in a 
much healthier organization.''

<HEADLINE> Woman Sentenced to Driving School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAK LAWN, Ill. (AP) -- An 18-year-old woman who drove a car into  
a suburban Chicago home, killing a teen-age boy as he watched 
television, was sentenced to an eight-hour driving school course. 
</P>
<P>
	The driver, Karee Krutilla, of Chicago Ridge, had been ticketed  
for negligent driving and failure to reduce speed to avoid an 
accident in the Nov. 28 collision that killed 17-year-old Joseph 
Seminara. 
</P>
<P>
	Krutilla says she lost control when she swerved to avoid an  
oncoming car that was weaving. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge on Thursday turned down a request by the prosecutor to  
impose the maximum $1,250 fine. Instead, Krutilla will have to pay 
only a $115 fee for the driving school course. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentence Thursday further angered the boy's family, who  
accused police of going easy on Krutilla because she is the 
grandniece of an Oak Lawn detective. 
</P>
<P>
	``The charges against this girl should have been more severe.  
This doesn't even amount to a slap on the wrist,'' said Kelly 
Takaki, his mother. 
</P>
<P>
	Police spokesman Lt. Robert Smith denied that Krutilla received  
any special treatment.

<HEADLINE> FCC Tries To Conserve Phone Numbers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Telephone regulators want to slow down the  
creation of new area codes and spare phone users from continually 
having to learn new dialing patterns. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Communications Commission responded to the  
proliferation of new area codes in recent years by asking for 
public guidance Thursday on ways to conserve the pool of phone 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Industry officials and others will have three months to comment  
on several commission proposals. Adoption of at least some of the 
proposals could come early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This item's long overdue,'' said Commissioner Gloria Tristani.  
``We're in a crisis with numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	FCC Chairman Bill Kennard said the need to change area codes  
imposes real costs to business and residential customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Consumers have to go through the trouble of alerting friends  
and relatives to the changes, and businesses have to spend money 
notifying their customers,'' he said. ``If we take responsible 
action now, we can avoid confronting a catastrophe in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Growing demand for cellular phones, pagers and second lines for  
modems and fax machines is often blamed. But more at fault is the 
way numbers are assigned, in blocks of 10,000, which leaves many 
numbers unused. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Pennsylvania goes from four area codes in 1994 to  
nine on June 5. California is projected to have at least 39 by 
2001, three times the 13 it had early 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Maine is considering a second area code, even though the 7.92  
million number combinations available ought to be enough for every 
man, woman and child in the state to have a modem line, a fax 
machine line, a pager and two cell phones, as well as a regular 
phone. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States now has about 215 area codes, almost double  
the 119 in service in 1991. Industry officials project the need for 
30 new codes a year unless changes are made. 
</P>
<P>
	The relief options outlined by the commission would not stop new  
area codes in the works but could prevent or delay the need for 
others in the future. Officials said the commission was likely to 
adopt more than one conservation mechanism. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the existing block system, created in the days of the  
telephone monopoly, competing local carriers acquire a block of 
10,000 numbers for every billing region they wish to serve. An area 
code may cover dozens or hundreds of such regions. 
</P>
<P>
	If a carrier has only 100 customers in a given region, the  
remaining 9,900 numbers of the block are tied up. As few as half of 
the available number combinations for each area code are actually 
assigned before a new code is requested. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission proposed assigning numbers in smaller blocks,  
such as 1,000 at a time, and expanding the size of billing regions 
to reduce the number of blocks needed. The commission also proposed 
administrative changes to require telephone companies to assign 
more of their numbers before requesting new blocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Also under consideration is an end to the existing ban on  
assigning different area codes for different types of technology. 
That could pave the way for the use of separate area codes for cell 
phones and pagers outside New York City, where such a mechanism was 
set up before the ban was imposed. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission also said it would review ways to charge  
companies that want blocks of numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem that we have is that a resource that has  
substantial value is given away for free,'' said Commissioner 
Harold Furchtgott-Roth.

	MCI WorldCom Buys Skytel for $1.3B  
</P>
<P>
	JACKSON, Miss. (AP) -- MCI WorldCom is buying the paging company  
SkyTel Communications for nearly $1.3 billion, announcing the deal 
just days after the companies scuttled rumors they were discussing 
a merger. MCI WorldCom and SkyTel, both headquartered in the 
Jackson area, already have ties. MCI WorldCom is the largest 
reseller of SkyTel services. MCI WorldCom President and CEO Bernie 
Ebbers said the two companies have been discussing the merger since 
March.

	Stocks End Higher; Dow Up 92.81  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rebounded today from yesterday's steep  
selloff as new economic data showing slower-than-expected growth 
helped calm fears about rising inflation and higher interest rates. 
Investors also jumped at the chance to pick up shares at cheaper 
prices as a result of this week's turbulent slump on Wall Street. 
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 92.81 at 10,559.74. 
Yesterday, the Dow plunged more than 235 points, or by 2.2 percent, 
in its steepest one-day point drop since Sept. 30, 1998, when the 
Dow tumbled 237.20. Broad-market indexes also rose today. The 
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 51.26 to 2,470.41.

	Personal Income Rises 0.5 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Money is burning a hole in Americans' pockets.  
Once again, consumers in April spent nearly as much as they earned, 
helping to push the nation's savings rate to an all-time low. 
Spending climbed 0.4 percent last month, a tad lower than the 0.5 
percent increase in Americans' personal income, the Commerce 
Department reported today. The income figure includes wages, 
interest and government benefits. ``Consumers have good reason to 
be out there spending, economist Mark Zandi said. ``They've got 
jobs, their incomes are rising, confidence is high and the stock 
market is booming.'' So far this year Americans are spending more 
than they earned.

	Kodak-Fuji Film Price War Flares  
</P>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- A photographic film price war between  
Eastman Kodak Co. and Japanese nemesis Fuji is flaring up as the 
peak summer season nears, and Kodak appears to be losing ground on 
its home turf once more. Kodak insists, however, that its seemingly 
sharp drop in market share in April is no more than a blip in its 
effort to rebound from a 1997 assault by Fuji Photo Film Co. that 
led to the elimination of 19,900 Kodak jobs. In the U.S. market, 
two retail surveys show that Tokyo-based Fuji grabbed 5 percentage 
points in unit sales at Kodak's expense during the first four 
months of 1999. Most of the gains came in April. But even with the 
decline, Kodak still accounts for about two-thirds of the rolls of 
film sold in this country. Eastman Kodak shares were down 1 3/16 at 
67 5/8.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- United Airlines' 19,000 newly organized customer

provides pay raises and signing bonuses. About 70 percent of those 
voting during the past few weeks approved the one-year pact the 
airline negotiated with the International Association of Machinists

ticket counter workers, reservationists, air freight agents and 
others. UAL Corp. stock was up 2 at 67 1/4.

	Court Overturns US Air Union Vote

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal court panel ruled today that a 1997  
union election in which US Airways passenger service employees 
decided to join the Communications Workers of America should be set 
aside. The Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia 
ruled that a lower court judge was wrong to throw out a prior 
election in which the employees voted against joining the CWA. 
Following the earlier election, the National Mediation Board ruled 
that the airline had tainted the vote by holding employer-employee 
roundtable discussions. The three-judge appeals court panel found 
that ``the board's order unconstitutionally restrained US Airways' 
speech leading up to the rerun election.'' US Airways stock was at 
48 9/16, up 1 1/4.

Justice Department oppose Litton Industries Inc.'s proposed $1.8 
billion purchase of Newport News Shipbuilding Inc., Defense 
Secretary William Cohen said today. Cohen said the Navy had made a 
``preliminary determination'' that the Litton bid for Newport News 
would excessively limit competition in naval shipbuilding. But he 
said the Navy had determined it would not oppose Litton's $500 
million cash offer for Avondale Industries Inc. Newport News stock 
finished at 27 1/2, down 5 1/4, while Litton's was up 2 7/16 at 65 3/16.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Fox Broadcasting Co. has reached an agreement  
with its affiliates under which the network will take back 20 
commercial spots each week that the stations had been allowed to 
sell themselves. The affiliates had protested the network's 
original plan to cut the amount of 30-second spots that each local 
station can sell every week from 90 to 70. Under a slightly revised 
plan announced, the network promised not to take back any spots 
during prime time or National Football League games. The move will 
mean less revenues for the 200 Fox-affiliated TV stations around 
the nation and more for the network.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Co. Unveils New Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAO JOSE DOS CAMPOS, Brazil (AP) -- The newest defenders of the  
Amazon rain forest rolled out of their hangars Friday, accompanied 
by the ``Star Wars'' theme and high expectations from Latin 
America's largest aircraft manufacturer, Embraer. 
</P>
<P>
	The two new military planes -- the EMB145 SA and the ALX light  
attack jet fighter -- are expected to play a key role in the $1.2 
billion Amazon Surveillance System, known as SIVAM, being developed 
by U.S. company Raytheon Corp. But Embraer also sees a broader 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	``The defense sector has always been one of our targets,'' said  
Embraer President Mauricio Botelho. ``These planes will stimulate 
... our military business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The EMB145 SA is a junior version of the AWACS surveillance  
plane, consisting of a surveillance system manufactured by Sweden's 
Ericsson mounted on an Embraer ERJ145, a 50-seat commuter jet. 
</P>
<P>
	The ALX light attack jet fighter is modeled on Embraer's own  
Super Tucano military trainer. Designed for border patrols and 
Amazon missions supporting SIVAM, the $6 million jet carries 
air-to-air missiles, bombs, cannon and 12.7 millimeter machine 
guns. 
</P>
<P>
	The planes are the latest coup by Embraer, a former  
government-run company and chronic money-loser that turned around 
after it was privatized in 1994. Last year Embraer turned a profit 
of $102.9 million -- the first in its 30-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	The new military planes boost Embraer's standing as one of the  
continent's premier manufacturers of military hardware and a 
much-needed source of hard currency. The dollars Embraer earns will 
add to Brazil's cash reserves, an important indicator as the 
country emerges from months of economic turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	Leading the comeback was the ERJ145, perhaps the world's premier  
commuter jet. Embraer delivered 60 of the $17 million planes last 
year, more than half of the total 116 planes it sold. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Embraer announced a $420 million deal to sell 21  
ERJ145s to England's Brymon Airways, a subsidiary of British 
Airways. Brymon placed seven firm orders and has options to buy 14 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	Embraer now has 255 firm orders for the plane, of which 124  
already have been delivered, and 242 options to buy spread out 
among 17 clients in 10 countries.

<HEADLINE> Father Pleads Guilty to Kidnapping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- A man who abducted his two daughters 20  
years ago, told them their mother was dead and made a new life for 
them under assumed names in Florida pleaded guilty Friday to 
kidnapping and was let off with probation and a $100,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephen Fagan, who could have gotten 20 years in prison, struck  
a plea bargain that called for five years of probation. 
</P>
<P>
	Answering mostly yes-or-no questions from the judge, Fagan, 57,  
acknowledged taking the girls from his ex-wife, Barbara Kurth, 
without her permission during what was supposed to be a weekend 
visit in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	The daughters, now 25 and 22, have stood by their father even  
after they learned last year that their mother was alive and that 
their names had been changed. They have refused to meet with their 
mother. 
</P>
<P>
	The hearing marked the first time that Ms. Kurth, Fagan and  
their daughters were in the same room since he kidnapped the girls, 
then 2 and 5. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Ms. Kurth, 49, approved the plea agreement.  
Even so, she said in a statement: ``Some days I believe that 
Stephen Fagan would have been kinder to really have murdered me 
rather than having done so only in the minds of my children -- at 
least then there would have been no question as to his 
punishment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the probation, Fagan was ordered to perform 2,000  
hours of community service in a Florida veterans hospital and pay 
$100,000 to a Boston children's charity selected by Ms. Kurth. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a tragic, difficult and wrenching case for  
everyone who has been victimized by Mr. Fagan's unlawful conduct,'' 
Judge Peter Lauriat said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fagan told the children their mother had died in a car wreck. He  
claimed that she was neglectful and an alcoholic, and that he 
needed to rescue them. At the time, he said, courts didn't look 
kindly on a father seeking custody. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was raised in a home where the best interests of the  
children always came first. They still do,'' Fagan said outside 
court. ``This has always been about Rachael and Lisa, for me. 
Nothing and no one else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Kurth, who was divorced from Fagan in 1978, has denied she  
was unfit and said she was suffering from narcolepsy, an illness 
that causes sudden, deep sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	The former lawyer was living under the name Dr. William Martin  
when he was arrested in his Palm Beach, Fla., mansion last year. 
Authorities caught up with him after Massachusetts state police got 
a tip that he was living in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time he was arrested, Fagan had married a prosperous land  
developer and was driving expensive cars and was a member of some 
of the most exclusive clubs in Palm Beach. He had fabricated a past 
that included a stint as a presidential adviser, chemist and CIA 
agent. 
</P>
<P>
	He admitted on the stand Friday that he hasn't held a job since  
he left Massachusetts, where he was a supervisor at the Harvard Law 
School legal aid bureau. 
</P>
<P>
	His daughters, Rachael and Lisa Martin, thanked their father in  
court for what they considered his sacrifices. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not feel victimized by our father,'' Rachael Martin  
said. ``We are convinced that his actions were from his heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kurth, who has remarried and is a biologist at the University of  
Virginia, has been unsuccessful thus far in reuniting with her 
daughters. While she sat with her mother and brother at one end of 
the courtroom Friday, the daughters sat with Fagan's current wife 
at the other. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those girls, we feel nothing but pity for them,'' said Kurth's  
brother, Peter Kurth. ``They are pathetically deluded and they are 
going to pay for it the rest of their lives. We wish them well. 
They're going to need it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference, the daughters said their father did not  
dupe them and said any reconciliation with their mother would be 
private. ``We're clearly not brainwashed,'' Rachael Martin said. 
``We've been raised and live our lives as independent women.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some legal observers questioned whether prosecutors sent the  
wrong message by allowing Fagan to avoid prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kidnapping is a very serious offense,'' said Wendy Murphy, a  
former prosecutor who heads the Victim Advocacy and Research Group, 
``and it's not less serious because a parent commits the act.''

	Milosevic Meets With Russian Envoy  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Despite no signs of any breakthrough  
developments, a Russian envoy was ``very satisfied'' after nine 
hours of face-to-face talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan 
Milosevic. Emerging from the talks, Viktor Chernomyrdin urged a 
pause in NATO's bombing campaign to give peace negotiations a 
chance. But the United States is insisting that Chernomyrdin is in 
Belgrade representing only Russia and not NATO. Meanwhile, the 
alliance took advantage of good weather to hit a wide range of

	KUKES, Albania (AP) -- The Albanian army today simulated a  
defense of its territory against a cross-border strike by Serbian 
forces, firing hundreds of artillery shells and rockets toward the 
embattled Kosovo frontier. The war games involved tanks, howitzers 
and 1,200 ground troops maneuvering several miles from the border, 
where Serbian forces have clashed with guerrillas of the Kosovo 
Liberation Army in recent days. NATO tried unsuccessfully to stop 
the exercise, fearing a Serbian military response in an area packed 
with more than 100,000 Kosovo refugees and international aid agency 
personnel.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Efforts by the United States and other nations

being threatened by renewed skirmishing over the disputed frontier 
region of Kashmir. The two nations have already fought three wars, 
two of them directly related to the Kashmir conflict. The latest 
flareup has resulted in an Indian helicopter gunship being shot 
down today, a day after Pakistan's armed forces said they had shot 
down two Indian jet fighters on the Pakistani side of the border 
that divides the province.

to shoot down two aircraft in the disputed Kashmir region is a 
favorite of soldiers, terrorists and guerrillas worldwide. They're 
deadly and difficult for pilots to target from the air. They are 
also relatively cheap, with a black market price of $50,000 to

constitutional. In his ruling, the judge said the law, aimed at 
what critics call ``partial-birth abortions,'' does not place an 
undue burden on women and that the state does have a valid interest 
in banning the procedure. Under the law, doctors who perform the 
procedure would be subject to first-degree murder charges and life 
in prison if convicted. Patients would not be punished.

<HEADLINE> Busy Hurricane Season Predicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Atlantic hurricane season is about to start,  
and federal officials say three weather phenomena will make it 
busier than usual. 
</P>
<P>
	The bracing outlook, which calls for three or more intense  
hurricanes instead of an average season's two, was issued Thursday 
by the National Weather Service, the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration, and the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, forecasters said, they expect more hurricanes in part  
because of La Nina, the opposite of El Nino. La Nina brings 
cooler-than-normal temperatures to the part of the Pacific Ocean 
off South America that sees warmer water temperatures during El 
Nino. 
</P>
<P>
	Also facilitating hurricane development will be low wind shear  
in parts of the Atlantic Ocean and the Caribbean Sea, and a wind 
pattern off west Africa that may feed developing storms. 
</P>
<P>
	People in hurricane-prone areas ought to start thinking about  
how they will handle the expected storms, and actively preparing 
for the chance of being in a storm's path, weather service director 
Jack Kelly cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the final analysis, even a perfect warning is an academic  
exercise if people don't get it or haven't thought about what they 
would do,'' Kelly said.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Jarrell, director of the National Hurricane Center, warned  
residents in areas that could be affected by hurricanes to heed any 
and all evacuation orders. 
</P>
<P>
	But he cautioned against fleeing when no evacuation order has  
been given, saying it would be safer to stay put in that situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``You tend to have too many people evacuate,'' Jarrell noted.  
``Trust me, there's not enough roads to get us all to Atlanta.''

<HEADLINE> 3 Charged in Baby-Smuggling Ring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two women and a lawyer have been charged with  
running an illegal baby-smuggling operation that sold 17 Mexican 
children to adoptive families in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Arlene Lieberman, 48, and Arlene Reingold, 47, neighbors in  
Medford on Long Island, were charged Thursday in federal court with 
conspiracy to violate immigration laws, along with mail and wire 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Reyes, 40, was arrested Wednesday night at his home in  
Douglas, Ariz., which abuts a Mexican border town called Agua 
Prieta where he had a law practice. He faces the same charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say the three sold babies for $20,000 or more  
without any of the required immigration and adoption paperwork. The 
adoptive parents were unwitting victims, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service said  
the children would be allowed to remain with their adoptive parents 
and that the government would work to legalize their status, The 
New York Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	But some parents still remain fearful about the children's  
future. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our biggest concern is that we don't want anyone to take our  
child away from us,'' Sara Kruchkow said of the 3-year-old girl she 
and her husband adopted. 
</P>
<P>
	The court papers allege that Reyes paid to have babies smuggled  
from his Agua Prieta office across the border to his Arizona home, 
sometimes by Mexican women posing as the children's mothers. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Timothy Macht said he could not comment  
on how the children were obtained. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the children were babies as young as two weeks old;  
others had serious medical problems despite assurances given to 
adoptive parents that the children were healthy, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	One couple was presented with a 7-year-old girl who was mentally  
retarded, malnourished and also showed signs of sexual abuse. The 
couple, in their 50s, returned her to Mrs. Lieberman and never got 
a refund on their $20,000, court papers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy they've been arrested,'' said Rosalie Liberto,  
a Long Island woman who adopted a little girl through the 
defendants two years ago and is still fighting to resolve the 
child's immigration status. ``We put our trust in people and they 
took advantage of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two women, referred to in court documents as ``The  
Arlenes,'' first came to the attention of authorities in 1990, when 
the state Department of Social Services received complaints that 
they were misleading adoptive couples and arranging adoptions 
without a license. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lieberman's phone number is unlisted. A man who answered  
the phone at Mrs. Reingold's home had no comment. Calls placed to 
lawyers representing the women were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Each woman was released on $150,000 bond. They have not yet  
entered pleas to the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, the defendants face up to 10 years in prison for  
each child illegally smuggled into the country. The wire and mail 
fraud charge carries a sentence of up to 5 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The state attorney general's office also filed suit Thursday  
against the two women and their husbands, Jay Lieberman and Dennis 
Reingold, seeking an order preventing them from participating in 
adoption placements.

<HEADLINE> Pinehurst Prepares for U.S. Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PINEHURST, N.C. (AP) -- Officials have closed Pinehurst's No. 2  
course to give maintenance crews nearly three weeks to prepare it 
for the 99th U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	The course, which is open to the public, was shut down Thursday.  
The tournament runs June 17-20. 
</P>
<P>
	``From our perspective, we're just going to try and manicure the  
course,'' said Brad Kocher, the chief superintendent of the eight 
courses at the Pinehurst Resort and Country Club. ``When the 
players set foot on this, it's going to be a pretty pure golf 
course. As pure as we can make it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kocher said No. 2 is closing at least a week earlier than most  
Open courses do before serving as host to the event. Officials say 
they're concerned about Bermuda grass around the putting surfaces, 
which was chemically treated in February, but has been slow to grow 
this spring. As a result, Pinehurst has spliced sod into several 
areas in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	During play this week, the newly sodded areas were deemed  
off-limits as ground under repair. That's something tournament 
officials would like to avoid during the Open, said Tom Meeks, the 
director of the USGA rules and competition staff, which is 
overseeing the course's preparation for the tournament. Meeks is 
scheduled to arrive at Pinehurst on June 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little concerned about all the sodding they're doing  
down there,'' Meeks said from his New Jersey office. ``If I get 
down there and don't like what I see, we'll have to go to the white 
paint.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The paint would outline unplayable areas from which players  
would be given relief. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pinehurst doesn't want to see any white paint, and neither do  
I, but if we have to, we will,'' Meeks said.

<HEADLINE> Nashville Charity Director Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- The director of the Nashville  
distribution warehouse for Feed The Children quit Friday amid an 
investigation into whether he and some of his employees stole 
donations to the charity. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Highfill resigned a day after charity president and  
founder Larry Jones appointed a longtime friend to replace Highfill 
while Tennessee authorities and his own staff investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tennessee Bureau of Investigation started a probe after  
WTVF-TV aired video of what the station said was Highfill and about 
six other administrative employees taking home boxes of donated 
goods. 
</P>
<P>
	State agents raided the employees' homes Monday. WTVF videotaped  
agents carrying out boxes and bags of brand-name clothing, shoes, 
videos, blankets, food and other goods they suspect were donated 
for poor people. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Highfill told WTVF he saw nothing wrong with  
allowing administrative staff to take donated items. No one 
answered the telephone Friday at his home.

<HEADLINE> Internet Rule Group Hits Snags </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- An international group drawing up rules to keep  
the Internet running smoothly conceded Friday that it is having 
difficulty finding the best way to represent the little guy in 
deciding questions such as how Web addresses are assigned. 
</P>
<P>
	The nonprofit Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and  
Numbers (ICANN) was set up in October after the U.S. government 
announced it wanted out of the business of managing the nuts and 
bolts of the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	But in drafting formal policies, a process to be completed by  
September 2000, ICANN has faced resistance from some Internet 
denizens unhappy at seeing the collegial nature of the global 
network's early days replaced with a topdown decision-making 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	ICANN's interim chairwoman, Esther Dyson, defended her mission  
by noting the explosive growth of the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Internet has been a tremendous success, but it's doubling  
each year,'' she said in an interview. ``When you increase the 
scale of something you do need to change the structure of how it's 
managed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Simple questions such as who gets the rights to use what name  
can turn into expensive battles given the increasingly commercial 
nature of the Internet. Is it first-come, first-serve in 
registering so-called domain names like ford.com, or does the 
automaker have special rights to its trademark in cyberspace as 
well? 
</P>
<P>
	While ICANN won't decide such questions itself, ``we are setting  
the policies for resolving that dispute,'' Dyson said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a two-day meeting in Berlin, the ICANN board appointed the  
Domain Names Supporting Organization (DNSO) to advise it on 
oversight of the domain name system. 
</P>
<P>
	Businesses and national registries were given seats, but the  
board deferred a decision on granting representation to 
``noncommercial interests'' because of conflicts within the Net 
community itself on who should represent it. 
</P>
<P>
	``There needs to be a role for individuals with ICANN,'' Dyson  
said. ``But our goal is not to recognize a group of people but a 
set of rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the problems, she said, was that some individuals actually  
represent commercial or national interests. There were also those 
who believed the interests of Net users would be best represented 
through the general membership, which gets to choose three of the 
board's 19 seats, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But one activist who traveled from New Zealand to attend the  
meeting, Job Tanstra, said that was unrealistic. ``It's unlikely 
that we'll have a large at-large membership simply because there's 
not a large awareness of ICANN,'' Tanstra said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dyson said the board hoped to attract more attention by holding  
open meetings around the globe. In March, it met in Singapore; the 
next one, on Aug. 26, is in Santiago, Chile. 
</P>
<P>
	But ultimately, ICANN will likely remain in the background for  
most Web-surfers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our mission is to keep the Internet working smoothly so that  
they don't need to pay attention to us,'' Dyson said.

<HEADLINE> Students, Staff Returning to School </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- For Emily Stepp, it's a matter of  
finding her car keys, a calculator and maybe closure. 
</P>
<P>
	She and hundreds of other Columbine High School students will be  
allowed back into the bomb-damaged building Tuesday to retrieve 
belongings left when they fled in terror of two teen-age gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be really sad, but I've got to go back in  
there,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The return is expected to be so upsetting that counselors will  
be available and parents have been invited, said Marilyn Saltzman 
of the Jefferson County School District. 
</P>
<P>
	The school has been closed since April 20 when seniors Eric  
Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 12 students and a teacher and 
wounded 21 others before taking their lives in the library. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators are turning the Columbine building back over to  
the school district, which will spend the summer renovating the 
rooms damaged by bombs, bullets and water. Only the library, the 
scene of many shootings, will remain closed to school officials 
while investigators continue to examine it. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kids are really anxious to get their belongings,'' Saltzman  
said. ``They have purses, glasses, credit cards and keys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Students and parents will be escorted to classrooms to retrieve  
their property. Items left in lockers, the commons or the library 
will be available in the auditorium or gymnasium, Saltzman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Stepp, who graduated last week, was in a publications office  
eating lunch with a friend when they heard shots. They tried to run 
out a front door but fled when gunfire shattered the glass. 
</P>
<P>
	Stepp then ran into an English department office where teachers  
were eating. They moved filing cabinets in front of the doors as 
bombs and gunfire erupted around them. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she was glad her parents, Paul and Ruth Selzman, will  
accompany her Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's going to be hard because that was my last day in there as  
a senior,'' she said. ``Most kids' last day in their school is 
happy.''

<HEADLINE> Kashmir Infiltration Stunned India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KARGIL, India (AP) -- At first, an army patrol saw a few  
suspicious black-clad men on a high ridge in India's closely 
watched Kashmir frontier region. Within days, reports were gushing 
in: The mountain ranges were swarming with infiltrators. 
</P>
<P>
	As the magnitude of the incursion near the Pakistani frontier  
became clear in the second week of May, the Indian military was 
stunned. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, Islamic guerrillas have frequently tried to  
cross into Indian-held areas of Kashmir to fight for independence 
for the Muslim-majority region. 
</P>
<P>
	But never before had so many infiltrators -- as many as 600 --  
crossed into India at once. Never before had they seized territory, 
apparently with the intention to hold it or die trying. 
</P>
<P>
	Days after Indian patrols first spotted the infiltrators on May  
6, India was engaged in escalating fighting along a 94-mile line. 
This week, for the first time since the last war with Pakistan in 
1971, India deployed aircraft in combat and lost at least three. 
</P>
<P>
	Both India and Pakistan claim all of Kashmir, a dispute spilling  
over from when Britain granted independence to colonial India in 
1947 and partitioned the territory into two nations. 
</P>
<P>
	For the last 10 years, India has battled an insurrection by  
Kashmiris seeking to sever the state from India, where Hindus are 
the majority. India says Pakistan supports the insurgents, and 
artillery shelling across the cease-fire line has become routine. 
</P>
<P>
	Accounts of how the fighting developed this month, from the town  
of Bitalik in the east to Kaobal valley in the west, emerged from 
military officers and fighters, none of whom could be identified by 
name. 
</P>
<P>
	The first clashes between Indian troops and the infiltrators  
came as early as May 8 near Dras, one of a half dozen towns on the 
highway that runs parallel to the Line of Control, as the 
cease-fire line is known. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next three days, the army realized it was facing an  
extraordinary situation. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Bitalik region, infantry units moved swiftly to isolate  
the militants on a 16,000-foot mountain peak, closing off escape 
and supply routes. 
</P>
<P>
	An army captain from a forward unit said he saw 30 or 35 men on  
the ridge, all ready for a fight, armed with mortars, 
rocket-propelled grenades and heavy machine guns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were surprised. We never expected them to cross the Line of  
Control,'' said the officer. ``The sanctity of the Line of Control 
had to be maintained.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officers said it was clear the operation had been planned for  
months, even while India and Pakistan were engaged in a diplomatic 
thaw. In February, the countries' prime ministers had drawn out a 
blueprint to ease military tension after both countries tested 
nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	The militants set ambushes for Indian patrols. Casualties were  
taken on both sides in close-quarter fighting, officers said. 
Several early Indian attempts to retake positions with ground 
forces were repulsed, with the defenders having the advantage of 
high ground. 
</P>
<P>
	Conditions were harsh for both sides. The peaks were still  
covered with snow, three or four feet deep. Temperatures were well 
below freezing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had no firewood, no petrol. The first 10 days we had only  
four meals,'' said a young captain, his nose and cheeks burnt from 
the snow-reflected sun. 
</P>
<P>
	The intruders retreated to higher peaks after a few days of  
fighting, but maintained control of the highway from the Kashmir 
valley that is the lifeline of this region. 
</P>
<P>
	After Indian artillery failed to dislodge the militants, the  
Indian Air Force on Wednesday launched their first airstrikes in 28 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	But army officers say the only way to evict the intruders is to  
send ground forces to sweep them out, in what could be a bloody 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has to be done,'' said one senior officer. ``They can't  
survive the winter up there, but we can't leave them there for the 
next five of six months.''

<HEADLINE> FBI, Senate Internet Sites Hacked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Internet sites for the FBI and the Senate  
remained inaccessible early today after hackers launched a series 
of electronic attacks against some federal government computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hackers defaced the Senate's Web page on Thursday before it was  
taken down. 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI took down its own Web site after the bureau found that  
hackers tried unsuccessfully to compromise it. It was unclear when 
the FBI site might be made available again. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was an attempt (Wednesday) by unknown persons to  
unlawfully gain access to the FBI.Gov Web site,'' said an agency 
statement Thursday. ``It was unsuccessful; however, as a 
precaution, the FBI shut down the site and is now taking additional 
steps to further insulate it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An obscene message left briefly on the Senate's Web site blamed  
the attack on what it said was the FBI's harassment of specific 
hacker groups, including the group that boasted of breaking into 
the White House site earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who laughs last?'' the message said in part, adding that the  
intent was to rebuke ``our friends at the FBI.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other federal Web sites, including those for the White House and  
the House of Representatives, appeared to be operating normally 
late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	MSNBC reported that the attacks stemmed from the FBI's execution  
of a search warrant on a prominent hacker's home in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI spokesman Rolando Moss confirmed that agents were  
investigating allegations of computer intrusions involving the 
Houston hacker. The FBI executed four search warrants that remained 
sealed, Moss said. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this month, a grand jury in northern Virginia indicted  
Eric Burns, 19, on three counts of computer intrusion. Burns is 
reportedly known on the Internet as ``Zyklon'' and is believed to 
be a member of the group that claimed responsibility for the 
attacks on the White House and Senate sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``Zyklon'' was one of a dozen names listed on the hacked version  
of the White House Web site, which was altered overnight Sunday for 
a few minutes before government computers automatically detected 
the intrusion. 
</P>
<P>
	Burns was accused of breaking into a computer used by the U.S.  
Information Agency between August 1998 and January 1999. The grand 
jury also said Burns broke into two other computers, one owned by 
LaserNet of Fairfax, Va., and the other by Issue Dynamics Inc. of 
Washington.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Internet sites for the FBI and the Senate  
remained inaccessible today after hackers launched a series of 
electronic attacks against some state and federal government 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
	Hackers defaced the Senate's Web page Thursday before it was  
taken down, and another group claimed responsibility for defacing a 
Virginia state government Web site that remained altered today. 
</P>
<P>
	A message left on the Virginia site announced, ``We think it's  
payback time now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The FBI said it took down its own Web site after the bureau  
found that hackers tried unsuccessfully to compromise it. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI spokeswoman Debbie Weyerman said it was unclear when the FBI  
site might be made available again but might not be until the 
weekend or early next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``We doubt it's going to be today,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	The attack did not affect the FBI's internal e-mail or other  
computer systems, she said, adding there was no evidence whether 
the hack on the Senate Web site was related to the FBI's problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Weyerman said the FBI's Web server computer suffered a  
denial-of-service attack, a common technique in which the computer 
was overwhelmed with repeated electronic requests -- like a 
telephone ringing so continuously that it blocks other callers. 
</P>
<P>
	An obscene message left briefly on the Senate's Web site blamed  
the attack on what it said was the FBI's harassment of specific 
hacker groups, including the group that boasted of breaking into 
the White House site earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who laughs last?'' the message said in part, adding that the  
intent was to rebuke ``our friends at the FBI.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sherry Little, a spokeswoman for the Senate Sergeant at Arms,  
which operates the Senate site, said technical experts met today 
with the FBI ``to resolve the problem to get the Web site back up 
and to figure out what security measures need to be put in place to 
prevent a reoccurence.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Little said the Senate shut down its own site shortly before 8  
p.m. Thursday, but she couldn't say when the site might be made 
available again. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate's e-mail and other systems also were not affected,  
she said, although the attack on the ``Senate.Gov'' site also 
crippled the Web sites for individual senators. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate was not in session today.  
</P>
<P>
	Other federal Web sites, including those for the White House and  
the House of Representatives, appeared to be operating normally.

<HEADLINE>  Twins' Squad Nearly Half Rookies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Some take comfort knowing they're not alone.  
Others make believe they're still in the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 Minnesota Twins are really the Minnesota Tykes.  
</P>
<P>
	Before catcher A.J. Pierzynski was sent back to the real minor  
leagues last week, the Twins had 12 rookies and 13 veterans on 
their roster, thanks to the club's payroll slashing that continued 
with the trade of Rick Aguilera. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the payroll is less than $17 million and general manager  
Terry Ryan has orders to prune wages even further. 
</P>
<P>
	While that has meant an abundance of growing pains and losses,  
it's also provided some comfort to the rookies who at least have 
company in their misery. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a calming effect,'' first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz  
said. ``It's 10 less guys you have to impress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow rookie Dan Perkins, a right-handed pitcher who grew up  
down the block from Mientkiewicz in Miami, had an unconventional 
way of dealing with the burden of become a big-leaguer. 
</P>
<P>
	He simply made believe he wasn't facing the likes of Ken Griffey  
Jr., Alex Rodriguez and Edgar Martinez last week, and it worked. He 
picked up his first major-league victory with six strong innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried not to let that affect me,'' Perkins said. ``I  
pretended it was the A-ball team for the Mariners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When other teams look at the Twins, they don't need to pretend  
they don't know these guys. 
</P>
<P>
	Mientkiewicz, Perkins, Torii Hunter, Mike Lincoln, Cristian  
Guzman, Joe Mays and Chad Allen were all members of last year's 
83-59 Eastern League championship team at Double-A New Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	Double-A.  
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of us skipped Triple-A and that's a huge jump to the big  
leagues,'' said Mays, a right-handed reliever. ``For us to skip 
that, there's a little learning process there that we have to go 
through now. But those guys in Triple-A had the same shot we did. 
None of us was given a bone. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to be in the hunt. But we're not going to lose  
100 games,'' insisted Mays, who figures it's better to hone one's 
craft at the big-league level anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm facing Hall of Famers, I'm 23 years old,'' he said. ``Alex  
Rodriguez is one of the best shortstops in the major leagues and 
Ken Griffey is an absolute stud. I mean, what better learning 
process than to face guys like that? If you can get them out, you 
can pretty much get any guy out.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Twins' Squad Nearly Half Rookies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Some take comfort knowing they're not alone.  
Others make believe they're still in the minor leagues. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 Minnesota Twins are really the Minnesota Tykes.  
</P>
<P>
	Before catcher A.J. Pierzynski was sent back to the real minor  
leagues last week, the Twins had 12 rookies and 13 veterans on 
their roster, thanks to the club's payroll slashing that continued 
with the trade of Rick Aguilera. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, the payroll is less than $17 million and general manager  
Terry Ryan has orders to prune wages even further. 
</P>
<P>
	While that has meant an abundance of growing pains and losses,  
it's also provided some comfort to the rookies who at least have 
company in their misery. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a calming effect,'' first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz  
said. ``It's 10 less guys you have to impress.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fellow rookie Dan Perkins, a right-handed pitcher who grew up  
down the block from Mientkiewicz in Miami, had an unconventional 
way of dealing with the burden of become a big-leaguer. 
</P>
<P>
	He simply made believe he wasn't facing the likes of Ken Griffey  
Jr., Alex Rodriguez and Edgar Martinez last week, and it worked. He 
picked up his first major-league victory with six strong innings. 
</P>
<P>
	``I tried not to let that affect me,'' Perkins said. ``I  
pretended it was the A-ball team for the Mariners.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When other teams look at the Twins, they don't need to pretend  
they don't know these guys. 
</P>
<P>
	Mientkiewicz, Perkins, Torii Hunter, Mike Lincoln, Cristian  
Guzman, Joe Mays and Chad Allen were all members of last year's 
83-59 Eastern League championship team at Double-A New Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	Double-A.  
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of us skipped Triple-A and that's a huge jump to the big  
leagues,'' said Mays, a right-handed reliever. ``For us to skip 
that, there's a little learning process there that we have to go 
through now. But those guys in Triple-A had the same shot we did. 
None of us was given a bone. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to be in the hunt. But we're not going to lose  
100 games,'' insisted Mays, who figures it's better to hone one's 
craft at the big-league level anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm facing Hall of Famers, I'm 23 years old,'' he said. ``Alex  
Rodriguez is one of the best shortstops in the major leagues and 
Ken Griffey is an absolute stud. I mean, what better learning 
process than to face guys like that? If you can get them out, you 
can pretty much get any guy out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is, the Twins haven't been getting them out.  
</P>
<P>
	In six games, the Mariners have outscored Minnesota 63-24.  
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Gary Rath and Rob Radlosky were teammates in Salt  
Lake City. Now they're in a different world, 60 feet 6 inches from

<HEADLINE> Spainish Track Stars Debut Stadium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEVILLE, Spain (AP) -- Spain's Fermin Cacho and Luis Miguel  
Martin came up with surprising victories Friday to highlight an 
IAAF Grand Prix track meet in the new stadium that will serve as 
host to the world championships in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Cacho, the 1992 Olympic champion in the 1,500 meters, moved up  
to 3,000 and beat 1996 Olympic silver-medalist Paul Bitok of Kenya. 
</P>
<P>
	With a final lap reminiscent of his victory at Barcelona nearly  
seven years ago, Cacho sprinted away from the field and waved to 
the crowd as he crossed the finish line in 7 minutes, 37.02 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin won the 3,000 steeplechase in a national record of  
8:11.18, more than four seconds faster than the old mark set by 
Domingo Roman in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin said he didn't expect to set the record in his first race  
of the season as he bettered his personal best by nearly 10 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	The 60,000-seat Olympic stadium was inaugurated earlier in the  
month with an eye on landing the 2008 Summer Olympics. Seville, 
however, would have a hard time in making a successful bud since 
Spain had the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there were two races when the stadium was opened with a  
soccer match, this was the first meet with top international 
athletes in competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic champion Deon Hemmings of Jamaica and American world  
record-holder Kim Batten met again in the women's 400 hurdles with 
Batten taking the victory in 53.99, far off her world mark of 
52.74. 
</P>
<P>
	Olympic 10,000 champion Fernanda Riberio of Portugal was beaten  
in the women's 3,000 by compatriot Marina Bastos, who was clocked 
in 8:38.13. Ribeiro was second in 8:39.82. 
</P>
<P>
	Cathy Freeman of Australia, the world champion in the 400, won  
her event in 51.06, beating Americans Shanelle Porter and Michele 
Collins.

<HEADLINE> Nude 'Macbeth' Staged in Strip Club </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CASSELBERRY, Fla. (AP) -- Skipping the usual oil wrestling match,  
an adult nightclub challenged an anti-nudity law Friday night by 
performing part of ``Macbeth'' in the nude. 
</P>
<P>
	Three dancers at Club Juana performed the opening witches scene  
from William Shakespeare's play as well as an adaptation of a play 
by the Marquis de Sade. 
</P>
<P>
	The performance was intended to challenge Seminole County's  
anti-nudity ordinance. Since the ordinance was approved in 
November, the dancers have been forced to wear at least a G-string 
and pasties. 
</P>
<P>
	The law exempts ``bona fide performances'' -- which, according to  
county officials, refers to legitimate theater. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're trying to say to the public, `Look at this. Your  
government officials have prevented nudity but they're exempting 
bona fide nudity,''' said Steven Mason, Club Juana's attorney. 
``Whose bona fide nudity? It's hypocritical.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officers from the county sheriff's department videotaped the  
performances and will decide whether to charge the women. 
</P>
<P>
	The show was not typical adult entertainment, said Lt. Sammy  
Gibson, commander of the City/County Investigative Bureau. ``There 
was some choreography to it and some reading parts and speech parts 
and literature parts,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel comfortable enough in saying that they were not  
professional theater-type performers,'' he said. ``They had not 
been -- or excelled -- in any theatrical school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Between the ``theater'' performances, the strippers returned to  
dancing in G-strings and pasties. 
</P>
<P>
	Dancers and club owners also have attacked the ordinance in  
court with four lawsuits, which are still pending.

<HEADLINE> Teen Walks Out of Graduation Prayer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SILVER SPRING, Md. (AP) -- No one was supposed to pray at  
Northern High School's graduation. Student Nick Becker, the 
American Civil Liberties Union and the state attorney general's 
office had persuaded Calvert County officials to observe 30 seconds 
of silence instead. 
</P>
<P>
	The prayer began, nevertheless. Becker walked out, and when he  
tried to go back in, police threatened to arrest him. 
</P>
<P>
	During the period of silence at Wednesday night's ceremony, a  
man began reciting the Lord's Prayer aloud. Virtually the entire 
4,000-member audience joined in. 
</P>
<P>
	Becker left, then tried to return, but was stopped by Maryland  
State Police. When he tried another door, police threatened arrest 
and detained him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told the cop I'm getting my diploma,'' Becker told The  
Washington Post for a story published today. ``He said, `You're not 
going back in.' He walked me over to the car, put me in the front 
of the patrol car and said he was going to give me a citation for 
failing to obey a lawful order.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police said Becker may face charges.  
</P>
<P>
	Later that night, school officials barred him from attending a  
school-sponsored cruise around the Baltimore Harbor for which he 
had already paid $45. They say the money will be refunded. 
</P>
<P>
	Prayer had been a part of Northern High's graduation ceremonies  
for years. A 17-year-old student, Julie Schenk, planned to deliver 
an invocation at graduation. 
</P>
<P>
	Becker objected, saying prayer doesn't belong in a public  
ceremony. The ACLU of Maryland and the attorney general's office 
told Calvert officials that prayer at graduation violates the 
constitutional separation of church and state. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Schenk agreed to ask for a 30-second ``time for reflection''  
that did not mention God. When she did so, the audience began to 
pray aloud. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a churchgoing community, and no one in Annapolis or  
Washington, D.C., is going to tell us when and where we can pray,'' 
said Linda Kelley, president of the Calvert County Commission, who 
joined in the prayer. ``The school administrators did the legal 
thing and complied with the law. But the audience took this one 
over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calvert County school policy bars any student who leaves a  
school event from returning. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't want him to disrupt the ceremony,'' said State  
Police Lt. George McKeon, adding that Becker was released to his 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
	Calvert County Superintendent James Hook said he was disturbed  
by the events. 
</P>
<P>
	``A moment of silence should have been respected,'' Hook said.  
``It shows disrespect for the young lady who asked for silence and 
for the young man who requested that the prayer not be done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	ACLU spokeswoman Suzanne Smith said detaining Becker was  
tantamount to arresting him. 
</P>
<P>
	``The real loser here is the Constitution and the right of  
people to express dissent,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Back Pain Pill Ordered To Fix Ads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly three years after the maker of Doan's  
back pain pills stopped running certain ads under pressure from the 
Federal Trade Commission, the agency wants the company to take 
action to erase lingering misbeliefs that the product is better 
than other pain relievers. 
</P>
<P>
	In a 4-0 decision Thursday, the commission ordered Novartis  
Consumer Health, maker of Doan's, to carry the following message 
for one year on its packaging and advertising for Doan's: 
``Although Doan's is an effective pain reliever, there is no 
evidence that Doan's is more effective than other pain relievers 
for back pain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Novartis says it may appeal the decision to a federal court.  
</P>
<P>
	The FTC filed its initial complaint in 1996, alleging that the  
advertising for Doan's was deceptive and made unsubstantiated 
claims that the product was better than other over-the-counter back 
pain relievers. 
</P>
<P>
	The company ceased such advertising in May 1996, but the  
commission ruled that such misbeliefs about the product persist. 
</P>
<P>
	Novartis spokeswoman Kate King said the company strongly  
disagrees with the FTC's findings that Doan's advertising ever 
claimed the pill is better than other products. 
</P>
<P>
	``Never did we say something about Doan's being superior,'' said  
King. ``This disagreement is really based on consumer perception of 
those claims.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said the company only claimed that Doan's is effective and  
that it contains an active ingredient that other analgesics do not 
have. Neither of these claims have been challenged, King said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC has long held that Doan's implied superiority with such  
slogans as: ``If nothing seems to help, try Doan's. It relieves 
back pain no matter where it hurts. Doan's has an ingredient these 
pain relievers don't have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The commission noted that the company spent $65 million, mostly  
in 15-second television and radio ads over eight years, to promote 
its original message. It ordered the company to spend as much in 
the corrective advertising as it did in an average year on the 
earlier ads. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, an administrative law judge upheld the FTC's 1996  
ruling that Doan's ads were unsubstantiated, but the judge refused 
to order the company to run corrective ads.

<HEADLINE> House Panel Eyes Teen Abortion Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A woman who helped her grandson's girlfriend  
get an abortion says a House panel should reject a proposal that 
would make it harder for teens to get abortions because women like 
herself could wind up in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please don't pass this law,'' an emotional Billie Lominick of  
Newbury, S.C., urged the House Judiciary constitution subcommittee 
at a hearing Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lominick's state requires a parent's consent before an  
abortion can be performed on a minor. She said the 16-year-old 
girl, Mary, had been abused by her parents and feared involving 
them after learning about her pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lominick said she helped get the girl to Georgia for an  
abortion after attempts to petition the courts for permission for 
the operation failed. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had not been with her, I don't know where she'd be  
today,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would make it a federal misdemeanor for someone other  
than a parent or guardian to transport a minor out of state for an 
abortion if doing so would violate parental consent or notification 
laws in the child's home state. 
</P>
<P>
	But Eileen Roberts, of Fredericksburg, Va., was in favor of the  
bill. She said she didn't realize her 14-year-old daughter had had 
an abortion until she needed hospitalization for depression and 
$27,000 in follow-up medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am here today to ask this committee to reject the eccentric  
notion that any adult stranger has the right to abduct our 
minor-aged daughters and take them to another state for a secret 
abortion,'' said Mrs. Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
	She said an adult friend drove the girl 45 miles away from home  
for the procedure. Virginia requires that parents be notified when 
minors seek abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., the panel's chairman, said the  
proposal's purpose is to uphold parental involvement laws in effect 
in more than 30 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters also say it would protect vulnerable girls from being  
spirited away by the self-serving, older men who get them pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill died in the Senate last year after passing the House by  
less than the margin required to overturn a threatened White House 
veto. 
</P>
<P>
	Canady said it was appropriate for Congress, with its powers to  
regulate interstate commerce, to pass such legislation. ``The 
safety of young girls and the rights of parents demand no less,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., criticized the proposal as a  
``thinly veiled attempt to chip away at a constitutionally 
protected right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abortion rights groups also oppose the bill, arguing that girls  
similar to the one in Mrs. Lominick's case may be forced to seek 
unsafe abortions instead of seeking the help of a friend when they 
are afraid to confide in their parents. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 1218.

<HEADLINE> Wash. Man in Standoff With Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHORELINE, Wash. (AP) -- A man fleeing a hit-and-run freeway  
accident ran to a home and attacked two women Friday, killing one 
and breaking the other's neck before barricading himself in a 
second house and opening fire on police, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	The second house contained a large number of weapons and the man  
fired dozens of shots, sheriff's officers said. 
</P>
<P>
	After an hourlong pause in the gunfire, officers fired tear gas  
into the house. By 8 p.m., 6 1/2 hours after the ordeal began, no 
shots had been fired from the house for nearly three hours. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said they were sending a remote-controlled robot into the  
house to see if the gunman was still alive. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were called to the area by a neighbor who heard a woman  
scream. When officers arrived, a man holed up in a nearby house 
began firing. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said two women, both in their 60s, were assaulted in the  
yard outside a home, possibly with a garden tool. One was 
bludgeoned to death, and the other was in critical condition with a 
broken neck. 
</P>
<P>
	SWAT teams converged on the scene and helped evacuate nearby  
homes. Students in a nearby elementary school were ordered to stay 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
	A female deputy was in serious condition with a fractured skull  
and cuts on her face apparently suffered when a bullet struck her 
vehicle, said Larry Zalin, a spokesman for Harborview Medical 
Center in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses told police they saw the suspect jump out of his car  
and run into the neighborhood after his car struck Anthony Venegas' 
motorcycle on Interstate 5 and caught fire. Venegas, 64, lost his 
left leg in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident and standoff forced police to close I-5 in both  
directions at the start of the evening rush hour for the holiday 
weekend.

<HEADLINE> No End Near to IRL-CART Feud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Don't count on Michael Andretti and Al Unser  
Jr. returning to the Indy 500 just yet. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite talks aimed at bringing the two sides together, Indy  
Racing League president Tony George gave a discouraging State of 
the Feud address Thursday, saying the IRL is no closer to an 
agreement with rival CART. 
</P>
<P>
	George, in his most extensive comments on the 4-year-old split  
in American open-wheel racing, accused CART of leaking reports of a 
reconciliation to boost its stock price, soothe sponsors and divert 
attention from the Indianapolis 500. 
</P>
<P>
	The scathing words came a couple of hours after the final  
practice for Sunday's race. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRL's new tether system, designed to keep the wheels and  
suspension parts from flying into the crowd during a wreck, was 
used for the first time on Carburetion Day. There were no crashes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to be the first to test it,'' Buzz Calkins said.  
</P>
<P>
	The system was introduced after debris killed three fans and  
injured eight others at an IRL event in Concord, N.C., on May 1. 
</P>
<P>
	George conceded it would be difficult for IRL and Championship  
Auto Racing Teams to survive as rivals. But he got no indication of 
common ground at a meeting last week with Andrew Craig, CART's 
chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as we have different philosophies, we're never going  
to strike any kind of accord,'' George said. ``I can't say I'm 
encouraged by anything we talked about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	George, also president of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, began  
the IRL in late 1995 as a low-cost, ovals-only alternative to CART. 
The older organization responded by boycotting the Indy 500, 
stripping the world's most famous race of open-wheel stars like 
Andretti and Unser. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to compromise ourselves just to get them back  
here,'' said George, preparing for his fourth 500 without CART. 
``It's as simple as that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	CART, which holds the Motorola 300 at Madison, Ill., on  
Saturday, is making plans to expand its 20-race schedule to other 
overseas markets. But Craig, sounding more conciliatory than 
George, said a return to Indy also is a priority. 
</P>
<P>
	``All we are attempting to do is to act in good faith for what  
we believe is in the best interest of the sport and the fans,'' 
Craig said after being told of George's comments. ``We have made no 
secret of the fact that all our teams would like to race in 
Indianapolis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two sides face major hurdles, such as totally different  
chassis and engine specifications. 
</P>
<P>
	George said he met with Craig in March and they got together  
again last week in Indianapolis. George also has met with NASCAR 
chief Bill France Jr., portrayed as the potential broker of a deal 
between the two open-wheel series. 
</P>
<P>
	George said his talks with Craig focused on their general  
support for open-wheel racing, but didn't focus on specifics for 
bringing the two sides together. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, George feels he has the upper hand because the IRL has  
the Indy 500. He said talk of a merger is merely an attempt to 
bolster CART, which is a publicly traded company on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need to continue to give some glimmer of hope that  
something is in the offing to help keep their stock price where 
they want it to be,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	George's right-hand man, IRL executive director Leo Mehl, also  
gave little hint of a compromise Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I call it the May whine,'' Mehl said. ``Those CART guys are  
very concerned with what's going on here. If they come back here 
with the same engines we use, the same chassis, they'll get their 
doors blown off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	George and Mehl said there would be no attempt to reach a deal  
that would allow the CART teams to return to the Indy 500 unless 
they run the other 10 IRL races, too. 
</P>
<P>
	The IRL moved forward with its plans to improve safety beyond  
Sunday's race, announcing a change in engine rules beginning with 
the June 12 event at Texas Motor Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	Engines must operate at no more than 10,000 rpms after the Indy  
500, a reduction from the current limit of 10,300. The change will 
reduce the cars' horsepower and should slow speeds by at least 5 
mph. 
</P>
<P>
	In preparation for the last event under the current rules, Sam  
Schmidt had the fastest lap in practice at 222.458 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``We certainly didn't go out there to have the fastest time of  
the day,'' Schmidt said. ``It just so happened I had a clear lap 
and popped off a good one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only starter who did not practice was Robby Gordon, who was  
in Madison, Ill., preparing for a CART race Saturday. Greg Ray, his 
Menard teammate and a front-row starter between polesitter Arie 
Luyendyk and Billy Boat, was second-fastest at 221.822 in his own 
car and third-fastest at 221.790 in Gordon's car. 
</P>
<P>
	Luyendyk, the two-time champion who will retire after Sunday's  
race, was next at 221.380.

<HEADLINE> Trinidad Sheds 18 Lbs. for Tune-up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) -- IBF welterweight champion Felix  
Trinidad has lost 18 pounds to reach the division limit of 147 
pounds for his fight Saturday night against Colombia's Hugo Pineda. 
</P>
<P>
	Trinidad was up to 164 pounds according to his doctor, Roberto  
Munoz Zayas. He will go into this bout at 146 and is favored to 
remain undefeated and set up a big-money September date with Oscar 
De La Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't lose this fight because it means I would miss my  
chance to knock out De La Hoya,'' Trinidad said. ``I have to win 
against Pineda to seek out this other fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya, the WBC champ, is looking forward to the  
welterweight unification bout. ``Let's get it on,'' he said in Las 
Vegas earlier this week. ``It will be the fight of the century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal for the bout has been bogged down by a money dispute  
between Trinidad's father, who is also his manager, and promoter 
Don King. They are arguing about how to split the $10.5 million 
purse and the split of the closed circuit television rights, with 
Trinidad seeking 75 percent of the TV profits. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men are expected to meet Sunday, after the fight, to  
continue negotiations, but both sides seem confident that the two 
fighters will meet in Las Vegas Sept. 18. 
</P>
<P>
	First, Trinidad, 34-0 with 28 knockouts, has to deal with  
Pineda, who has won 36 fights but has just one knockout. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight begins 11 p.m. EST in San Juan, the Puerto Rican  
capital and will be broadcast on HBO with purses of $2 million for 
Trinidad and $12,000 for Pineda.

<P>
	MADISON, Ill. (AP) -- Were it not for the fill-'er-up theory on  
Michael Andretti's final pit stop last year, he might be the 
defending champion of Saturday's CART Motorola 300. 
</P>
<P>
	The blink of an eye was the difference between winning and  
chasing Alex Zanardi as he took the checkered flag. Andretti 
finished in second place, 0.573 seconds back with fuel to spare and 
a definite feeling of emptiness. 
</P>
<P>
	``They pulled it all apart and basically we were too  
conservative,'' Andretti said. ``They waited so they got every drop 
of fuel in. It was such a shame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Both drivers stopped for tires and fuel on the 175th of 236  
laps. Zanardi took a chance by not quite filling up the tank, and a 
caution flag allowed him to finish without problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Andretti had a faster car that day, but there aren't a lot of  
opportunities to pass on the 1.27-mile oval track at Gateway 
International Raceway. Most of the action takes place in turns 1 
and 3, but Andretti knows sometimes the best place to make a move 
is in the pits. 
</P>
<P>
	``Track position is king,'' Andretti said. ``I was a little  
quicker than Zanardi, I just couldn't get by him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andretti led for 133 laps last year and a race-high 66 laps in  
1997, the inaugural event at Gateway International Raceway. He 
finished 11th that year because of another fuel strategy that 
backfired and forced him to pit on green. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *TETHER TALK:* Some drivers are a bit worried about the tire  
tethers the front wheels will be equipped with for the first time 
on Saturday. The step that has been taken to prevent fan injuries 
could end up hurting them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a little concerned what's going to happen if something  
occurs and the wheel is still connected,'' Richie Hearn said. 
``Normally you hit the wall two or three times because you lose 
control of the car and I'm a little concerned about what the wheel 
is going to be doing. I trust the engineers have got it right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Christian Fittipaldi also will believe the tethers work when he  
sees it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to be the one to try them,'' he said. ``It's a  
very delicate issue because you want to take care of the fans, but 
at the same time it might be better if the wheel just came off the 
car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The tethers are being added in the wake of a crash during an  
Indy Racing League event on May 1 in Concord, N.C., where three 
fans were killed and eight injured by a wheel and suspension parts. 
There have been no additional steps taken at Gateway such as 
raising the height of the fences or the overhangs at the top of the 
fences. Gateway is not a banked track like the Concord track, so 
it's generally thought that it's less likely there will be 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike the IRL, which will have tethers on all four wheels at  
the Indy 500 on Sunday, CART is equipping only the front wheels for 
now due to a shortage in the space-age material used to make the 
cables. It's planned to add tethers to the back wheels in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
	Most drivers agree that tethers probably will be a good thing.  
</P>
<P>
	``We've done a lot of things to help the safety of the  
drivers,'' Max Papis said. ``This will allow people to come to the 
race without thinking of their lives being in danger.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NO REGRETS:* Rookie sensation Juan Montoya is quite content  
going for his fourth straight CART victory in front of some 70,000 
fans rather than giving it a try in at Indy, which still draws 
close to 400,000 fans despite losing some of its luster. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everyone says it's a great experience and a great race, and  
I've enjoyed watching it on television,'' Montoya said. ``But you 
can't miss something you've never done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Montoya isn't enamored of Indy's extended schedule, which in  
years past covered the entire month of May. Now the regimen is more 
like a week-and-a-half of testing, practicing and qualifying, but 
that's still a lot longer than the CART routine. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most places we come in, test one day, qualify the next and  
race,'' Montoya said. ``That (Indy) would be very different, and I 
don't know whether I'd like it.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *BLUNDELL'S RIDE:* Mark Blundell, who cracked a vertebrae when  
he crashed in testing at Gateway earlier this month, is hoping to 
return to the circuit for the Budweiser/G.I. Joe's 200 June 20 in 
Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	Blundell is being replaced this weekend by Roberto Moreno, who  
is attempting to double at the Motorola 300 and Indy on Sunday. 
X-rays scheduled to be taken next week are the key to his 
timetable. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to come back unless I'm 100 percent because this  
injury can be very bad if it happens again,'' Blundell said. ``If 
my boys had taken me out the wrong way, they could have killed 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blundell said it's tough watching.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing you can do but wait, and you know race drivers  
have no patience,'' the Englishman said.

<HEADLINE> Talks in Pebble Beach Sale Heat Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. (AP) -- An investment group headlined by  
Arnold Palmer, Clint Eastwood and Peter Ueberroth hopes to close a 
deal soon for the purchase of the famed Pebble Beach golf course. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Ferris, formerly United Airlines' chief executive, is  
also aligned with the group discussing the purchase of the seaside 
links, which are among the world's premier golf properties. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guys are out there talking and that's pretty much it,''  
Palmer said Friday in a phone interview with The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer indicated a deal could come at any time.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've been waiting to hear something the last couple of days,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	If the sale occurs, it would mark the second time in the past 10  
years that Pebble Beach has been sold by Japanese interests. 
</P>
<P>
	Lone Cypress, an Japanese investment partnership, paid Minoru  
Isutani an estimated $500 million for Pebble Beach in 1992. Isutani 
lost a reported $350 million on his deal, having paid an estimated 
$850 million to a partnership led by oilman Marvin Davis for the 
resort in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer would not discuss the price but there has been  
speculation the Pebble Beach resort could go for between $800 
million and $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Stilwell, executive vice president of the Pebble Beach Co.,  
did not immediately return a phone call Friday seeking comment on 
the latest sale negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	Ueberroth and Ferris were said to be traveling and unavailable  
for comment and Eastwood did not return a phone call to his Los 
Angeles production office. 
</P>
<P>
	The resort properties include four golf courses -- the Pebble  
Beach Golf Links, Spyglass Hill, The Links at Spanish Bay, Del 
Monte Golf Course, along with two luxury hotels and the spectacular 
17-Mile Drive that winds through Pebble Beach and nearby Del Monte 
Forest. 
</P>
<P>
	The 99th U.S. Amateur will be played at Pebble Beach Golf Links  
and Spyglass Hill on Aug. 16-22, and Pebble Beach will play host to 
its fourth U.S. Open next summer.

<HEADLINE> Sarajevo's Olympic Hall Reopens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) -- Zetra Olympic Hall,  
destroyed by Serb gunners during the Bosnian war, was reopened 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than 100 people attended a small, closed ceremony that  
featured a few dozen teenagers, dressed all in white, dancing 
briefly to broadcast music. A big ball symbolizing the Earth was 
placed in the middle of the hall. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, at this place, where until a few months ago there was  
nothing but senseless ruins, we are gathered to receive the gifts 
of Olympic friendship and solidarity,'' said Bogic Bogicevic, 
president of the Bosnian Olympic Committee. ``Here we witness the 
victory of good over evil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The hall was rebuilt with the help of money from the  
International Olympic Committee, whose president, Juan Antonio 
Samaranch, turned over the key to Mayor Rasim Gacanovic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, we celebrate the culmination of our collaborative  
efforts to rebuild this Olympic Hall, which we hope will contribute 
to the process of reconstruction of Bosnia and reconciliation 
between its people,'' Samaranch said. 
</P>
<P>
	The head of the European Union Office in Bosnia, Hansjorg  
Kretschmer, said that ``international sporting events at Zetra will 
carry a message of peace and understanding around the globe.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``After nearly four years of grim fame as the besieged city in  
... Europe, Sarajevo is again becoming the city of the Winter 
Olympic Games,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zetra Hall was opened at the end of 1982 as one of the most  
important structures for the 1984 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Until it was bombed in May 1992, it was the site of many  
competitions and championships at a national and international 
level. To Sarajevans it was the symbol of the most memorable days 
of their city. 
</P>
<P>
	The hall, rebuilt for $17.8 million, features a shining new  
copper roof, built to match the original. There's one difference: 
Sarajevans no longer proceed to the Zetra Hall through a park and a 
former stadium. Both were turned into graveyards during the war. 
</P>
<P>
	The original opening ceremony was scheduled for March 30, with a  
pompous program including the performance of world class skaters. 
But NATO's airstrikes in neighboring Yugoslavia delayed the opening 
and canceled the extended program.

<HEADLINE> Fed Proposes Y2K Loans to Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Banks, thrifts and credit unions would get  
special loans under a Federal Reserve plan designed to make sure 
they can handle any emergency caused by fears over Year 2000 
computer problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank is seeking public comment on the proposal,  
which would offer the loans from Nov. 1 through next April 7. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan would allow banks, thrifts and credit unions ``to  
confidently commit to supplying loans to other financial 
institutions and businesses through the rollover to the new 
century,'' the Fed said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the second major step taken by the central bank designed  
to avert possible disruptions in the nation's banking system 
because of the so-called Y2K computer problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the Fed ordered an additional $50 billion of new  
currency to put into circulation in the event people make a run on 
banks and automated teller machines late in the year. By year's 
end, $200 billion in currency will be stored in government vaults, 
up from the $150 billion normally held in reserve. That's in 
addition to the $460 billion in notes circulating in the United 
States and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim McLaughlin, director of regulatory affairs at the American  
Bankers Association, said the special loans would provide an extra 
cushion of cash to the system as a backup if needed, although the 
trade group anticipates that very few banks will have to use it. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank acknowledged that ``uncertainty surrounds  
potential developments over the period'' because of the millennial 
date change. But it stressed that it does not expect widespread or 
prolonged computer disruptions from the technology problem, caused 
by the possibility that some computers originally programmed to 
recognize only the last two digits of a year could interpret 2000 
as 1900.

<HEADLINE> NEC Posts Record Loss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- NEC Corp. posted its biggest yearly loss ever --  
$1.31 billion -- in the latest fiscal year because of weak demand 
for its telecommunications equipment, sagging semiconductor prices 
and a writeoff involving its U.S. affiliate, Packard Bell NEC Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's largest computer maker reported Friday it lost 157.95  
billion yen in the fiscal year that ended March 31 compared to a 
net profit of 41.30 billion yen for fiscal 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales fell 2.9 percent to 4.76 trillion yen, or $39.49 billion,  
from 4.90 trillion yen a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	NEC, which makes products ranging from personal computers to  
fiber-optic networks, blamed the country's recession for the 
decline in sales. 
</P>
<P>
	``Japan's economy saw a freeze in private-sector capital  
investment and a wide-scale decrease in consumer spending,'' the 
company said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The loss ballooned because of a one-time write-off of  
undisclosed proportion on the operations of NEC's U.S. personal 
computer affiliate Packard Bell, and a decline in the yen-based 
value of foreign assets because of a rise in the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Packard Bell division, based in Sacramento, Calif., lost  
$500 million last year as its share of U.S. personal computer sales 
dropped, NEC said earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
	NEC said in February that it plans to cut 15,000 jobs, or nearly  
10 percent of its work force, over three years in an attempt to 
boost profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's earnings announcement was the latest in a series of  
miserable reports from Japanese technology companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Fujitsu Ltd. Toshiba Corp., Hitachi Ltd., and  
Mitsubishi Electric Corp. also said they lost money last year. 
</P>
<P>
	All of the companies are major computer chip makers forecasting  
that rising prices this year will drive a recovery in earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	NEC forecast a net profit of 25 billion yen and sales of 5.05  
trillion yen for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2000.

<HEADLINE> Firm Says Trademark Was Violated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- RE/MAX, one of the nation's largest real estate  
firms, contends a real estate agent is improperly using the 
company's name and its balloon logo to sell properties in Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	The company has asked the State Department to intervene in the  
dispute with the Cuban company, set up by Stephen Marshall, RE/MAX 
president Daryl Jesperson said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an illegal and unauthorized use of our trademark. We have  
a responsibility to the members of the RE/MAX system to protect our 
prestige,'' Jesperson said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Jesperson's main concerns is that the Cuban advertising  
splashed with RE/MAX and its trademark red, white and blue balloon 
will anger Cuban-Americans in Florida, the company's No. 1 market. 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall did not immediately return an e-mail seeking comment  
and did not list a phone number on his Web page. 
</P>
<P>
	A State Department official said the government is looking into  
the trademark complaints. 
</P>
<P>
	Marshall told The Miami Herald that he paid $75,000 to RE/MAX's  
Caribbean subfranchiser to use the name and open five offices in 
Cuba. The company has been doing business for at least 1 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
	RE/MAX executives ``thought their attorneys had found the magic  
agreement to get around U.S. laws,'' Marshall said, referring to 
the U.S. embargo on business with Cuba. ``They knew full well I was 
here. Now they've had some sort of memory loss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jesperson said his company never received any money from  
Marshall and only learned of the Cuban firm's existence several 
months ago.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft May Buy Into Telekom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. wouldn't be averse to  
taking a stake in Deutsche Telekom, Germany's former telephone 
monopoly, as it looks for new ways to sell its products, the 
software giant's president said in Friday's Handelsblatt newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Steven Ballmer told the German business daily that a stake in  
Telekom isn't Microsoft's main aim, but ``it would be all right'' 
if talks to secure new distribution channels lead to an investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Telekom Chairman Ron Sommer, in an interview in Die Welt  
newspaper Friday, declined to comment on contact with the U.S. 
company. ``Microsoft is of course an interesting partner -- one with 
whom we already cooperate on a number of projects,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Speculation that Microsoft and Telekom, which is in the process  
of being privatized, are in talks have made the rounds for a while. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the chairman of German media conglomerate  
Bertelsmann, Thomas Middelhoff, said in a speech that his firm was 
considering a joint bid with Microsoft for Telekom's cable 
television network, which is up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither company was willing to comment directly on the  
discussions, but a spokesman for Microsoft said then that all three 
``are part of a circle which meets regularly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The weekly magazine Der Spiegel has reported that Bertelsman and  
Microsoft were prepared to offer up to $5.6 billion for the cable 
network, just above the $5 billion that rival bidder Deutsche Bank 
is believed to be willing to pay. 
</P>
<P>
	Telekom said at the start of the year it would split its  
17-million-subscriber network into nine regional companies, 
possibly maintaining a stake in some.

<HEADLINE> New Hampshire Going Liberal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Is the Granite State going soft?  
</P>
<P>
	For years, New Hampshire was the only state without a Martin  
Luther King Jr. holiday, one of only two states with laws banning 
gays from adopting, and one of only two with neither an income nor 
general sales tax. 
</P>
<P>
	In three short months, lawmakers did away with the first two  
distinctions and came perilously close to ending the third. 
</P>
<P>
	Other anomalies: The Democrats control the Senate for the first  
time since 1912. The state's first female governor, Democrat Jeanne 
Shaheen, is in the middle of an easily won second term. And the 
publisher of the state's largest and most conservative newspaper 
retired this month. 
</P>
<P>
	Some see this as evidence that the flinty Live Free and Die  
state is moving toward the political center. 
</P>
<P>
	``Folks outside of New Hampshire are beginning to say, `What's  
going on up there? You're changing!''' House Minority Leader Peter 
Burling, a Democrat, said Thursday, two days after lawmakers passed 
the King holiday bill. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the shift has been brought about by Democrats trying to  
``haul New Hampshire back into the mainstream of American 
politics,'' and by moderate Republicans going along. He also gives 
Shaheen some credit. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is simultaneously a symbol of the centralization of New  
Hampshire politics and a cause of it,'' he said. ``In many ways, 
she truly empowers the center to get what it wants.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic activist Deborah Arnie Arnesen, whose losing bid for  
governor in 1992 was based on a proposal for an income tax, 
attributed the changing climate to the public, not legislative 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``Change is in the air,'' she said. ``It's as if in anticipation  
of the new millennium, New Hampshire is not only catching up, it's 
leading.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arnesen pointed to the recent retirement of Union Leader  
publisher Nackey Loeb as proof that the fiercely conservative 
agenda it espoused is in decline. Loeb's late husband, William 
Loeb, was credited with being the architect of the state's anti-tax 
pledge, which every governor elected for the past three decades has 
been forced to take. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Union Leader is not same powerful player because there are  
so many alternative ways of getting information,'' Arnesen said. 
``To some extent, I think Nackey realizes the torch has been 
passed, and rather than see the torch flicker, she left.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another indication of the shift toward the center is the number  
of voters who are now unaffiliated with either major party. 
Republicans still outnumber Democrats, but they are losing ground, 
while Democrats and independents are gaining. As of 1998, there 
were 272,110 registered Republicans, 271,694 independents and 
203,563 registered Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	Until this year, talk of an income tax in New Hampshire was  
political poison. But when the state's high court demanded the 
Legislature come up with a fairer way of paying for public schools 
than using local property taxes, the House voted for an income tax. 
</P>
<P>
	The House backed down when Shaheen threatened a veto.  
Ultimately, the state enacted a uniform, statewide property tax 
plus a hodgepodge of smaller tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
	Some said lawmakers were willing to at least consider an income  
tax because of a growing population of elderly people with no 
children in school, and an influx of young, wealthy families -- 
mostly from Massachusetts -- who demand good schools and other 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	Others dismiss the idea that any of the events at the Statehouse  
represent a philosophical shift, particularly the gay adoption and 
King holiday votes. Instead, they say these events merely reflect 
New Hampshire residents' belief in less government in people's 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
	``In our own way, we are an extraordinarily tolerant state, but  
sometimes we resist being led to other people's definition of 
tolerance,'' said Tom Rath, a lawyer and Republican analyst. 
``Those bills reflect the essence of the state's political 
philosophy. It's almost a New England sort of social 
libertarianism, that certain things are really not everyone's 
business.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To the dismay of the Christian Coalition, the Legislature passed  
a law in 1997 wiping out three criminal abortion statutes dating 
from the 1800s, making New Hampshire the only state without any 
restrictions on abortion. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire lawmakers also passed a bill last year giving  
equal rights in housing, employment and public accomodations to 
homosexuals. 
</P>
<P>
	As for legislators voting for an income tax, observers such as  
John Camobreco, a political science professor at the University of 
New Hampshire, said that might never have happened if the Supreme 
Court hadn't put the pressure on. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we talk about New Hampshire changing, we have to put it  
into context,'' he said. ``The context was a crisis.''

<HEADLINE> Marlins' Boles Misses Another Game </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Florida Marlins manager John Boles missed Friday's  
game against the Cincinnati Reds because of a cervical sprain and 
spasms in his neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Boles missed two games this month after undergoing back surgery.  
It has not been determined if the back surgery is related to Boles' 
latest malady. He has already started physical therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Third base coach Fredi Gonzalez took over the club for the third  
time this season and bench coach Joe Breeden moved to third. 
Gonzalez is still seeking his first win as interim manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got another chance at getting my first `W','' Gonzalez said.  
``Bolesy only missed two games after back surgery, so a neck spasm 
will probably keep him out for about 40 minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The results of an MRI on Boles' stiff neck Friday were negative.  
He's listed day-to-day, but will most likely return Sunday.

<HEADLINE> TWA Makes Final Offer to Machinists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Trans World Airlines on Friday presented what  
officials called a greatly improved, but final, offer to 
International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. 
</P>
<P>
	The three-year contract offer comes less than two weeks before  
the 16,000 union workers could legally walk off the job on June 10. 
The union has threatened to strike after two years of failed 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis-based airline made the offer during negotiations  
in Washington between TWA chairman William Compton and union 
negotiators. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's our best and final offer,'' TWA spokesman Jim Brown said.  
``There will be no better offer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Union officials did not immediately return phone calls from The  
Associated Press. But Brown said IAM leaders agreed to submit the 
company's offer for a ratification vote as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're certainly hopeful that's a good sign,'' Brown said.  
</P>
<P>
	As TWA has struggled financially over the past decade, employees  
have taken several pay cuts needed to keep the airline afloat. As a 
result, the workers earn far less than their counterparts at other 
major airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	TWA's previous proposal would have taken employees to 90 percent  
of the industry pay standard by the end of 2001 -- the airline says 
it can't afford full parity. Brown said the new offer gets to 90 
percent six months faster, by mid-2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The new plan also includes a new wrinkle -- cash payments for all  
workers covered by the IAM. The payments would be $4,600 for 
mechanics, $4,100 for ramp workers, $2,100 for passenger service 
and reservations employees, and $5,000 for flight attendants. The 
money would be paid over 1-3 years, in two or three payments, 
depending on the job. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal calls for mechanics to get an 18 percent raise over  
the three years of the contract. Ramp workers would get a 10 
percent raise, passenger service/reservations workers a 14 percent 
raise, and flight attendants a 27 percent raise. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, the airline lost almost $5 per paying passenger for  
every 1,000 miles. TWA has lost money every year since 1989, for a 
total of more than $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline employs 21,500 people, including 8,700 in St. Louis  
and 3,500 in Kansas City. The airline also carries about 75 percent 
of all commercial traffic in and out of Lambert Airport in St. 
Louis, its domestic hub.

<HEADLINE> AP Clarifies Lamar Alexander Story </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- In a May 14 speech reported on by The  
Associated Press, Republican presidential candidate Lamar Alexander 
singled out Cendant Corp. in his call for teachers unions to pull 
their pension fund investments out of companies that produce 
violent video games. 
</P>
<P>
	Alexander described Cendant as the creator of Phantasmagoria,  
one of the games he cited. 
</P>
<P>
	Cendant at one time owned Sierra On-Line, the software company  
that created Phantasmagoria. Elliot Bloom, Cendant's vice president 
for corporate communications, said the company had already sold its 
consumer software division at the time of Alexander's remarks.

<HEADLINE> Shuttle Closes In on Space Station </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Discovery and its crew closed in on  
the international space station Friday for the first-ever docking 
between the shuttle and the new orbiting outpost. 
</P>
<P>
	The space shuttle was scheduled to arrive early Saturday with 2  
tons of gear for the 230-mile-high space station, which was 
launched last year and consists of only two rooms so far. 
</P>
<P>
	``The history of this moment shouldn't be lost on us,'' said  
Frank Culbertson, NASA deputy program manager for space station 
operations. He pronounced the docking ``a very significant event -- 
one that we're going to repeat many, many times in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Space shuttles have docked nine times with Russia's Mir station  
in recent years. But this marked the first time since Skylab in the 
mid-1970s that NASA docked with its own space station. 
</P>
<P>
	Discovery will be linked to the 77-foot, 70,000-pound space  
station for nearly six days. 
</P>
<P>
	This weekend, spacewalking astronauts will attach a crane and  
other tools to the station's exterior. And the crew of seven will 
also unload spare parts, computers, tools, water and clothes for 
the station's first permanent inhabitants, who are supposed to move 
in next March. 
</P>
<P>
	The arrival of the first long-term inhabitants keeps getting  
postponed because of the Russians' inability to complete a 
component that will double as living quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the absence of the Russian component -- it should have  
gone up last year -- Saturday's docking had to be revamped. 
</P>
<P>
	Engineers devised a plan in which the station's large thrusters  
would be turned off and small thrusters would be used to hold the 
station steady during Discovery's slow and cautious approach. 
</P>
<P>
	In preparation for the astronauts' arrival, controllers on the  
ground cranked up the heat toward room temperature aboard the space 
station. Normally, it is about 25 degrees when no one is there. 
</P>
<P>
	Once completed, the space station will have about a dozen rooms  
and stretch longer than a football field.

	Personal Income Rises 0.5 Percent  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans' personal income rose again in April  
but their spending followed fast on its heels, contributing to an 
all-time low in the nation's savings rate. Personal income -- which 
includes wages, interest and government benefits -- rose 0.5 percent 
last month, the Commerce Department said today. Spending climbed by 
0.4 percent. Americans' income has grown every month so far this 
year, climbing 0.3 percent in March, 0.5 percent in February and 
0.6 percent in January, according to the latest government 
estimates. However, spending has also risen steadily, and more 
quickly.

from the current 9:30 a.m.-4 p.m. Eastern time schedule. A second 
session of the day would likely start at 5:30 p.m. and end at 9 
p.m. or 10 p.m. The changes are expected to take effect around 
September, after a review by the Securities and Exchange Commission 
and discussions with industry leaders. Stocks would still have a 
final, closing price reported at the 4 p.m. end of the daytime 
session. Any after-hour trades would count toward the following 
day's stock price. Initially, trading would be limited to Nasdaq's 
100 largest, nonfinancial companies, led by Microsoft and including 
such other well-known stocks as Intel Corp., Northwest Airlines

	NEC Posts Record Loss  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- NEC Corp. posted its biggest yearly loss ever --  
$1.31 billion -- in the latest fiscal year because of weak demand 
for its telecommunications equipment, sagging semiconductor prices 
and a writeoff involving its U.S. affiliate, Packard Bell NEC Inc. 
Japan's largest computer maker reported Friday it lost 157.95 
billion yen in the fiscal year that ended March 31 compared to a 
net profit of 41.30 billion yen for fiscal 1997. Sales fell 2.9 
percent to 4.76 trillion yen, or $39.49 billion, from 4.90 trillion 
yen a year earlier. NEC, which makes products ranging from personal 
computers to fiber-optic networks, blamed the country's recession 
for the decline in sales.

software giant's president said in Friday's Handelsblatt newspaper. 
Steven Ballmer told the German business daily that a stake in 
Telekom isn't Microsoft's main aim, but ``it would be all right'' 
if talks to secure new distribution channels lead to an investment.

United States and Asia were more than offset by declines to Latin 
America and the Middle East. The Japan Automobile Manufacturers 
Association said Friday the drop to 337,845 vehicles was the third 
consecutive monthly decline. Shipments to crisis-hit Asia rose for 
the first time in 19 months as the economies of some countries in 
the region appeared to be bottoming out. Japan's vehicle exports to 
the United States were also up, rising 11.1 percent to 116,898.

Hong Kong's gross domestic product shrank 3.5 percent in the first 
three months of 1999, the fifth consecutive quarter of contraction,

by a slump in the semiconductor industry, is about to go ahead. 
Motorola said yesterday it is beginning construction that's 
expected to add about 500 jobs. ``When completed (in 2002), the 
Chandler facility will be our largest manufacturing campus in the 
world,'' said William Seiferth, chief of staff for Motorola's 
Semiconductor Products Sector. The expansion will triple the number 
of processors, microcontrollers and other devices made in Chandler. 
During the past year, under pressure of the Asian economic crisis 
and the related semiconductor slump, Motorola eliminated 2,075 jobs 
in metro Phoenix. Analysts say the slump has bottomed out.

with pay pending the outcome of an investigation, the firm

securities firm, said it had made a ``mistake in judgment'' last 
year when it paid a middleman, Charles Joseph Luethke, to help set 
up a police sting operation against Christian Curry. Curry had been

<HEADLINE> Bonds Up a Bit in Shortened Trading / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices moved slightly upward Friday -- if  
they moved at all -- as traders set aside recent inflation and 
interest rate concerns in pre-holiday dealings. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading was light in an abbreviated session in advance of the  
three-day Memorial Day holiday. The market closed early at 2 p.m. 
EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond rose 9/32  
point, or $2.81 1/4 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves 
in the opposite direction, fell to 5.83 percent from 5.84 percent 
late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The gains were less pronounced among shorter-term issues, which  
finished unchanged to up 1/32 point. Intermediate-term issues were 
unchanged, according to Bridge Telerate, a financial information 
service. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's activity captures the anxieties in the fixed-income  
arena as May comes to a close,'' William V. Sullivan Jr., senior 
economist for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Federal Reserve Board is expected to tighten  
monetary policy in late June if the economic data for May coming 
out after the holiday indicate growth is too strong or that 
inflation is accelerating. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Fed moves to boost short-term rates, it would have its  
greatest impact on short-term Treasury securities whose prices 
would fall, Sullivan said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said the 30-year bond could benefit from such a move  
because a rate rise may keep inflation in check. Rising inflation 
erodes the value of long-term bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Sullivan said a government report Friday that Americans'  
personal income rose 0.5 percent in April while spending rose 0.4 
percent had been expected and had little impact on bond trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were steady at 4.63 percent  
as the discount held at Thursday's late level of 4.51 percent. 
Six-month yields rose to 4.82 percent, as the discount gained 0.01 
percentage point to 4.64 percent. One-year yields were unchanged at 
4.96 percent as the discount held at 4.71 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, held at 4.87 1/2 percent, the same as late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds up 7/32 to 121 27/32. The average yield to 
maturity fell to 5.37 percent from 5.39 percent.

	DRAS, India (AP) -- India denied a report that it rushed its top  
fighter jets to the disputed region of Kashmir on Friday to enhance 
airstrikes against alleged Islamic guerrillas. The private STAR TV 
news channel said the Indian air force dispatched its Sukhoi 
fighter jets to beef up its strike capability. The move comes one 
day after two Indian MiG jets crashed in Pakistan. A military 
spokesman in New Delhi, S.K, Mulik, said, however, that the report

Milosevic. Viktor Chernomyrdin's trip comes amid criticism from 
both Russia and Yugoslavia that the indictment of Milosevic was 
ill-timed and undermined any chance of reaching a peace deal soon. 
The U.N. war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, indicted 
Milosevic and four top aides Thursday. They are accused of crimes 
against humanity for planning and carrying out war crimes against 
ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.

	Progress Made in Eradicating Polio  
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- Substantial progress has been made in eradicating  
polio worldwide, but federal health officials said Thursday that 
much more work is needed in India and parts of Africa. The World 
Health Organization's goal is to eradicate the crippling virus by 
2000. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said that 
will require a ``major acceleration'' of polio-fighting efforts in 
some places. Polio cases reported in southeast Asia increased last 
year to 4,673, up from 2,827 in 1997. The CDC said the rise is 
likely due to improved reporting and surveillance of the virus.

<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- All states should require chicken pox  
vaccinations for children entering day care or elementary school, 
federal health officials said. The requirements are recommended 
because the highly contagious disease is most prevalent among 
children ages 1 to 6, the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention said Thursday. Some 4 million Americans, mostly 
children, get chickenpox every year. Caused by the varicella virus, 
it typically just causes severe itching and rash in children.

president. Gore has a 2-to-1 lead in the poll among Democrats and 
those leaning Democratic against former New Jersey Sen. Bill 
Bradley. But four out of 10 of all respondents say there is no 
chance they would vote for Gore.

	Reno Faults Aides on China Inaction  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Attorney General Janet Reno faulted  
subordinates Thursday for not coming to her two years ago with 
their disagreement over whether to wiretap a nuclear weapons 
scientist suspected of spying for China. ``I was not briefed on the 
details,'' Reno said. National Security Adviser Samuel Berger also 
defended himself against accusations he wasn't aggressive enough 
when Energy Department officials briefed him in 1996 about security 
lapses at a weapons laboratory. ``I did take it seriously. I did 
act,'' Berger said on PBS' ``NewsHour With Jim Lehrer.''

	KISII, Kenya (AP) -- At least 110 people have died in western  
Kenya in an outbreak of what is believed to be a strain of virulent 
highland malaria, a health officer said Thursday. Another 2,000 
people are hospitalized. Kisii district health officer Dr. Thomas 
Ogaro said the local government hospital has treated more than 
3,055 malaria cases, and some 1,386 people have been admitted for 
treatment since the beginning of the month. A reporter who visited 
the hospital Thursday found patients writhing on the floor because

<HEADLINE> China Puts 3 Dissidents on Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Three Chinese labor-rights campaigners have gone  
on trial for subversion for trying to organize workers laid off 
from a state-run firm, a human rights group and officials said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial of Yue Tianxiang, Guo Xinmin and Wang Fengshan opened  
Thursday in the central city of Tianshui, 700 miles west of 
Beijing, the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic 
Movement in China said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hearings also were held Friday, said officials at the Tianshui  
Intermediate People's Court who refused to give their names. They 
did not say when a verdict was expected. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted of leading a subversive group, the three could be  
sentenced to 10 years or more in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial comes as authorities step up detentions and  
surveillance of dissidents to prevent public commemorations of next 
Friday's 10th anniversary of the military assault that ended the 
Tiananmen Square democracy movement. More than 50 dissidents have 
been taken in by police and at least 15 are still being held. 
</P>
<P>
	China's communist leaders are nervous that dissidents will use  
the anniversary to whip up anger among millions of unemployed 
workers whose once-guaranteed lifetime jobs have been sacrificed to 
free-market reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Dissidents have applied to police in two cities for permits to  
hold gatherings to mark the crackdown, with 90 registering in the 
central city of Xi'an, New York-based Human Rights in China said. 
The Hong Kong-based Information Center said police rejected an 
application by 50 others in Hangzhou. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges against the three labor-rights organizers are among  
the stiffest used against dissidents. They were accused of 
subverting state power by setting up a group to protect workers' 
rights, of organizing protests by laid-off workers and of receiving 
$400 from an unidentified U.S.-based organization, the Information 
Center said. 
</P>
<P>
	They also were accused of having contacts with ``enemy''  
organizations in Hong Kong and the United States, and of belonging 
to the illegal China Democracy Party, the center said, quoting a 
lawyer for one of the defendants. 
</P>
<P>
	Yue, 44, and Guo, 43, worked for the Tianshui City Transport  
Company in western Gansu province, but they and 1,800 others were 
let go, the center said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even as the firm racked up losses of $6.8 million in three years  
and stopped paying unemployment benefits, executives bought 
themselves apartments and spent $65,000 on entertainment, including 
a junket to the southeastern city of Guangzhou, the group said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 4, Yue and Guo founded the Chinese Workers Monitor to  
try to organize their colleagues to put pressure on the firm, but 
were arrested a week later, it said. Wang, an engineer in another 
firm, acted as an adviser to the other two, the center said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tianshui Transport's problems are typical of many state  
companies. Although state firms are supposed to provide minimum 
stipends for their laid-off workers and pensions for their 
retirees, many have no money to do so and go unpunished by the 
government.

<HEADLINE> New Speed Limit in Montana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- With the flashing lights of a Montana  
Highway Patrol car in his rearview mirror, Jody Darcy made history 
Friday morning as one of the first motorists stopped for violating 
the state's new speed limit. 
</P>
<P>
	Once the only state without a daytime speed limit, Montana's  
status as an American autobahn ended at dawn Friday when a 75 mph 
limit, day or night, took effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Montana Highway Patrolman Michael Schmauch clocked Darcy going  
90 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's ticket time,'' Schmauch said as he closed in at nearly  
100 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Darcy nodded sheepishly when asked if he was aware of the new  
speed limit. He got a $20 ticket, half what could have been 
written. 
</P>
<P>
	For the last three years, drivers in Montana were allowed to go  
as fast as they wanted, as long as it was ``reasonable and 
prudent'' based on traffic, road and weather conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers revived limits this year after the state Supreme Court  
ruled that the so-called ``basic rule'' was unconstitutionally 
vague. 
</P>
<P>
	The limit on interstate highways now is 75 mph and the maximum  
on most two-lane roads is 70 mph. Fines start at $20 for up to 10 
mph over the limit; the maximum is $100, for speeds of 106 mph and 
over on the interstate or 101 mph on other roads. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite being nailed, Darcy offered no complaints over the new  
law. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you need a speed limit,'' Darcy said. ``I imagine  
there will be fewer wrecks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He was among four drivers Schmauch stopped in a 90-minute span.  
</P>
<P>
	Some, like Brian Giordano, were let off with warnings even  
though they were clocked at 80 mph and above. Giordano was stopped 
for going 84 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't been pulled over in two to three years,'' he said.  
``It's time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schmauch, an 18-year veteran of the patrol, said he welcomed the  
return of the speed limit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were getting people daily out here at 100 mph or more,'' he  
said. ``You'd look at them and they'd just go by. It was a little 
bit frustrating.''

<HEADLINE> Swimmer's Marijuana Ban Is Upheld </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAUSANNE, Switzerland (AP) -- An arbitration panel on Friday  
upheld the three-month suspension imposed on American swimmer Gary 
Hall Jr. last year for a positive marijuana test. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall, winner of two relay gold medals at the 1996 Atlanta  
Olympics, allegedly tested positive for marijuana at a meet in 
Phoenix on May 15, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	FINA, world swimming's governing body, handed Hall a three-month  
suspension on Nov. 6 of that year. Hall then appealed to the Court 
of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) in Lausanne. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-man CAS panel upheld the ban Friday, saying, ``The FINA  
anti-doping rules constituted a sufficient legal basis to allow the 
federation to sanction athletes for use of marijuana, including 
sanctions for out-of-competition tests.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hall, who lives in Phoenix, won gold medals as part of the U.S.  
400-meter freestyle and 400 medley relay teams in Atlanta. He also 
won silver medals in the 50 and 100 freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, FINA deducted two of the three months already  
served by Hall during a temporary suspension. That left him with 30 
more days to serve through Dec. 12. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall won a court-order that allowed him to compete in a World  
Cup meet in Texas on Dec. 2, where he won the 50-meter freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	It was unclear whether Friday's ruling will annul that victory  
from the books. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Hall said he has been diagnosed with diabetes and is  
considering retiring from swimming. 
</P>
<P>
	FINA said Hall had also tested positive for marijuana during the  
1996 Olympics. He received only a warning then, however, because 
FINA's ban on marijuana was not in effect at the time.

<HEADLINE> Cuban Foreign Minister Replaced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAVANA (AP) -- Cuban Foreign Minister Roberto Robaina, long  
considered a possible successor to President Fidel Castro, has been 
replaced by Castro's 34-year-old chief of staff, Felipe Perez 
Roque, the government announced today. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear what the move meant, and it was not  
immediately announced what new role Robaina would assume. 
</P>
<P>
	A brief story on the front page of the Communist Party daily  
Granma said that Robaina ``who made the greatest efforts to 
complete his job during the time he was in charge, is freed from 
his position until a new function is assigned to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The note said that Castro proposed Perez Roque for the job and  
that it was approved by the Council of State, comprised of the 
country's most powerful and trusted government officials, as well 
as by the top leadership of the Communist Party of Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
	Appointed foreign minister in 1993, Robaina has overseen the  
communist country's foreign policy during years of extreme economic 
hardship following the collapse of the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Through his almost constant travels around the world, Robaina  
has been credited with helping Cuba expand and strengthen its ties 
with many nations following the lose of its communist allies. 
</P>
<P>
	Felipe Perez Roque is a deputy with the National Assembly,  
Cuba's unicameral legislature, and a member of the Council of 
State. He also belongs to the party's Central Committee, the 
party's directorate. 
</P>
<P>
	Robaina was just 37 and head of the party's Union of Communist  
Youth when he was appointed to the post. He had no foreign 
experience. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement does not necessarily mean that Robaina is being  
moved aside. Robaina's predecessor, Ricardo Alarcon, went on to 
become president of the National Assembly and continues to play an 
important role in both domestic and foreign policy, especially with 
the United States.

<HEADLINE> N.Y., Calif. Transit Aid May Be Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A California lawmaker is fighting a Senate  
provision that would cut federal mass transit aid to two big states 
and boost it for the other 48. 
</P>
<P>
	The language was included in a $49 billion transportation bill  
for the coming fiscal year that the Senate Appropriations Committee 
approved Thursday, 27-1. The sole dissenting vote was cast by Sen. 
Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., because of the transit provision. New 
York has no senators on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	At issue was what is called in the bill the ``transit equity  
provision,'' which would limit each state to a maximum of 12.5 
percent out of $5.1 billion in federal mass transit spending. Any 
funds a state would be due above the limit would be distributed 
equally to the other states. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, only two states exceeded that figure: New York's 15.9  
percent, or $813 million, and California's 13.6 percent, or $696 
million. Underlining the large share of the funds those two states 
receive, the next closest state was Illinois, which got 6.7 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Feinstein said the proposal could cost California $117 million  
next year and New York $160 million. She said that together, the 
two states have nearly half the nation's transit riders: New York 
has 34 percent, and California has 14 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Transit is and should be a needs-based program,'' Feinstein  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The House Appropriations transportation subcommittee approved  
its own $50.7 billion bill Thursday without any similar limits on 
how mass transit money is distributed to states. That means there 
is a good chance the Senate language will not make it into a 
compromise House-Senate bill later this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., chairman of the Senate  
Appropriations transportation subcommittee, defended the proposal. 
He said he was protecting smaller states from the big states' 
ever-growing use of the transit funds. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Ted  
Stevens, R-Alaska, White House budget director Jacob Lew said the 
administration ``strongly opposes'' the state limits on transit 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Reflecting a larger fight between the White House and Congress  
over proposed spending, the letter also said the bill's overall 
price tag is ``simply inadequate to make the necessary investments 
that our citizens need and expect.'' The letter, however, did not 
threaten a presidential veto. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelby dropped provisions he included earlier this week that  
would have required airlines to give passengers more information 
about bargain fares and expected late arrivals. He said he would 
watch voluntary efforts by the airlines to improve information 
provided to passengers and might revive the provisions later. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelby said he eliminated the language after being lobbied so  
heavily this week by the airline industry that ``it felt like my 
office was a chalet at the Paris air show,'' an annual event 
heavily attended by airline company representatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate panel also approved a $21.6 billion energy and water  
projects bill that would increase spending for security at Energy 
Department facilities in the wake of revelations of Chinese spying. 
It would also cut administration requests for improving water 
quality in the San Francisco Bay area and Florida's Everglades.

<HEADLINE> Ford Denies Lorain Plant Closure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND, Ohio (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. is denying reports it may  
close its Lorain plant with 1,875 workers and shift production to a 
plant in Avon Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford spokesman Nick Sharkey said Friday that the company has no  
plans to close the Lorain Assembly Plant, located 25 miles west of 
Cleveland. Workers at the plant install interior and mechanical 
pieces in Ford's Econoline vans after the bodies are made in the 
Avon Lake plant. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have 1,875 employees who do the final production on the  
Econoline vans in Lorain and we fully expect them to continue doing 
that,'' Sharkey said. ``We have no plans to close that plant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford is considering having the Avon Lake plant do all of the  
Econoline production if the company decides to stop building the 
Mercury Villager and Nissan Quest minivans there, The Plain Dealer 
reported Friday, citing auto industry sources it did not identify. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford and Nissan North America Inc. are discussing ending  
production of those vehicles at the plant in 2002, the newspaper 
reported. The companies have a contract to produce vehicles there 
until 2004. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Vines, Nissan's vice president for corporate  
communications, said his company does not want to end the contract 
early and that a decision is expected in several weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford does not plan to end its contract with Nissan early,  
Sharkey said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We fully expect the contract to go to 2004 and continue  
operating the plants as we have been,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Union leaders at both plants said they were unaware of any plans  
to change production of the Econoline vans. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Ford eliminated 1,600 jobs by closing the part of the  
Lorain plant that built the Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Confident on Kosovo Outcome </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Defense Secretary William Cohen said today he  
is increasingly confident that NATO's air campaign will succeed in 
restoring ethnic Albanian refugees to their homes in Kosovo before 
winter sets in. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview on Day 66 of Operation Allied Force, Cohen told  
reporters there is no consensus in NATO for turning the conflict 
into a ground war, and he insisted the air campaign is succeeding. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am increasingly confident, given the amount of damage we are  
doing day by day,'' Cohen said. He also asserted there are 
``signals'' of declining morale and increasing discontent within 
the ranks of the Serb army in Kosovo, and he noted sporadic reports 
of anti-war demonstrations in some Serb towns. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just going to intensify this until such time as we're  
satisfied that this can be brought to a successful conclusion,'' 
Cohen said. He emphasized that the Clinton administration has no 
intention of introducing ground troops into Kosovo until there is a 
peace settlement with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen also predicted that Milosevic eventually will be brought  
to justice to face the war-crimes charges announced this week by an 
international tribunal. ``One day he will,'' the defense secretary 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the top intelligence officer for the Joint Chiefs  
of Staff said NATO's bombing has destroyed large chunks of the 
Serbian military while strengthening and emboldening a rebel 
militia on the ground in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kosovo Liberation Army has tripled in size from about 5,000  
guerrilla troops at the start of the air campaign in March to 
between 15,000 and 17,000 now, Rear Adm. Thomas Wilson said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	While far fewer than the estimated 40,000 Serb army and police  
troops in Kosovo, the KLA is effective at attacking Serb forces 
essentially pinned down by the NATO bombing, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO insists the ethnic Albanian KLA is not a partner in the  
fight against Milosevic and his Serb forces in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	But Wilson said NATO wants to help take out Serb tanks, armored  
personnel carriers and artillery because the equipment represents a 
major advantage that Serb forces now have over the KLA. 
</P>
<P>
	``So we believe that it's important to continue to destroy that  
equipment and also to try to make it immobile and keep them kind of 
out of the fight, because it tends to level the playing field 
between the KLA and the army,'' Wilson said at a briefing for 
reporters at the Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson also gave a detailed assessment of the damage inflicted  
so far on Serb forces, including a 35 percent reduction in 
broadcast capability of Serb television and radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson said the Serb air defense forces have lost about half of  
their more sophisticated surface-to-air missiles, the 
Soviet-designed SA-3s and SA-6s. 
</P>
<P>
	Bombs have destroyed more than 20 Serb early warning radars, and  
seven of the nine major military airfields in Serbia are out of 
commission, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson said the war-crimes indictment of Milosevic announced  
Thursday will not change NATO's military objectives. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton said the charges against the Yugoslav leader  
and four other top Serb officials ``will help to deter future war 
crimes by establishing that those who give orders will be held 
accountable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The indictment alleges a long list of crimes against ethnic  
Albanians in the disputed Serb province of Kosovo, including 
causing an exodus of refugees. Ethnic Albanians were a majority in 
Kosovo before the war began, but a minority elsewhere in Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of  
Staff, said refugee camps outside Yugoslavia are being readied for 
the NATO campaign to continue into cold weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking at a news conference in North Carolina where he was  
getting an award, Shelton said, ``Winterization of the camps will 
enable (bombing) to go right on into the winter if that is 
required.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton said the air attacks are proceeding as military planners  
expected and that achieving goals would take time. 
</P>
<P>
	The KLA is successfully recruiting among ethnic Albanian  
refugees now congregated in camps in neighboring Balkan countries, 
Pentagon officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
	NATO has tried to keep the KLA at arm's length throughout the  
fight over Kosovo, leery of close association with a guerrilla 
force with different aims and possibly unsavory tactics. 
</P>
<P>
	The KLA is fighting for Kosovo's independence from Serbia, while  
NATO has favored autonomy for the province but not outright 
independence. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, it is obvious that even a ragtag army on the ground could  
be helpful to NATO as the alliance relies exclusively on air power 
to rout the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	``They appear to be a resurgent group which has taken advantage  
of NATO airstrikes, a general western sympathy and a groundswell of 
volunteer fighters,'' Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
	The KLA is also benefiting from more organized leadership and  
improved supply lines, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said Wilson was not implying a  
new coziness with the KLA. 
</P>
<P>
	``He just stated the obvious, which is that after 64 days of  
pounding, the (Serbs) have been diminished in their capability,'' 
Bacon said. ``Our goal has never been to empower the KLA to create 
more fighting. Our goal has been to end fighting in Kosovo.''

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Up on Weather News / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean future prices surged Friday on  
the Chicago Board of Trade as weather forecasts held the attention 
of investors. 
</P>
<P>
	In a session shortened to get a jump on the three-day Memorial  
Day weekend, corn and soybean prices were boosted by reports of a 
possible high-pressure ridge forming next week in the Midwest, 
which could result in hot, dry conditions for corn and soybeans. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dick Loewy, president of AgResource Co. in Chicago, said  
there was little evidence of a drought pattern and believes the 
rally was due to an oversold market as traders tried to even things 
up before the long weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat continued to recover from new contract lows set on Monday  
as prices were supported by the prospects of more rain-induced crop 
disease. Hail also did severe crop damage in Oklahoma this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for July delivery settled 2 1/4 cents higher at $2.52 1/4 a  
bushel; July corn rose 3 cents to $2.19 1/2 a bushel; July oats rose 2 
cents to $1.23 a bushel; July soybeans rose 4 1/2 cents to $4.61 3/4 a 
bushel.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Economy Keeps Shrinking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Hong Kong's economy contracted further in the  
first quarter, but at a slower rate, the government announced 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong's gross domestic product shrank 3.5 percent in the  
first three months of 1999, the fifth consecutive quarter of 
contraction, as most analysts had expected. 
</P>
<P>
	But the contraction was less severe than the 5.8 percent decline  
in the final quarter of last year and 5.1 percent contraction for 
all of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's true the pace of recovery is slow, but the direction is  
the same,'' government economist Tang Kwong-yiu told a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Most analysts and economists agree that the worst was over, but  
a full economic recovery will take time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hesitate to use the word `recovery' but the Hong Kong  
economy has already bottomed out,'' said Shamus Mok, economist at 
the Bank of East Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	In a report, Tang blamed the continuing recession on worsening  
unemployment, lower consumer spending, declining exports and lower 
investment spending because of high interest rates and the banks' 
cautious corporate lending. 
</P>
<P>
	But the narrowing trade deficit, continued revival in tourism  
and increased consumer spending should pull Hong Kong out of 
recession by the end of this year, it said. 
</P>
<P>
	The government maintains an earlier forecast that that the  
economy will grow by 0.5 percent this year, Tang told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not being overly optimistic,'' Tang said. ``The latest  
figures cannot deny one thing: The pace of recovery is slow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tang said Hong Kong's exports to the United States -- the  
territory's largest trading partner -- would be affected by any 
trade restrictions imposed by the United States in the wake of 
recent allegations of Chinese military spying. 
</P>
<P>
	Tang added, however, that Hong Kong's exports to the United  
States were currently consumer goods and therefore ``not sensitive 
nor need to be restricted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he said Hong Kong ``should worry about the overall economy''  
of the United States and the uncertainty over the effect of higher 
U.S. interest rates on Hong Kong's financial markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of Hong Kong's currency peg with the U.S. dollar, Hong  
Kong interest rates normally follow the movements of U.S. rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, a series of interest rate cuts in Hong Kong  
has helped pull in a cascade of liquidity into the markets, 
stabilizing the stock market and property market, Tang said. 
</P>
<P>
	Guonan Ma, an economist at Merrill Lynch, said although investor  
confidence, stable markets, and increased consumer spending has 
improved sentiment, the Hong Kong economy is still weighed down by 
a weak trade balance, high costs, and rising unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
	``We may still see a decline in GDP by the end of the year,'' Ma  
said.

	WESTERVILLE, Ohio (AP) -- An eighth-grader was suspended for the

</P>
<P>
	The teacher, Tom Northrup, did not develop a rash.

<HEADLINE> Colo. Panel Issues Death Sentence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) -- For the first time since being given the  
power to decide punishment in capital cases, a three-judge panel 
has opted to give a convicted murderer the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
	The sentence handed down to 25-year-old Francisco Martinez on  
Thursday is the first death verdict by a panel of judges since a 
controversial 1995 Colorado law designated them to make sentencing 
decisions in death-penalty cases in the state. Previously, juries 
decided such sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	In two earlier cases, the three-judge panels had opted for life  
sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say the new law puts death penalty decisions in the  
hands of a more impartial panel, while defense attorneys argue the 
process will lead to more appeals and political pressure on judges 
up for retention. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez was convicted in September for his role in the slaying  
of 14-year-old Brandaline Duvall, who was gang-raped and tortured 
in May 1997 after being picked up at a Denver bus stop. Miss 
Duvall's body was found in a ditch near a creek. She had been 
stabbed 28 times. 
</P>
<P>
	Martinez's lawyers did not dispute their client played a role in  
Miss Duvall's death, but argued the state's main witness, Sammy 
Quintana, killed her. The defense also urged the judges to consider 
Martinez's abusive upbringing by an alcoholic, psychotic mother and 
a violent father who abandoned the family when Martinez was 4 years 
old. 
</P>
<P>
	Quintana was sentenced to 96 years in prison as part of a plea  
bargain. Two other defendants received life sentences for murder, 
and three others faced lesser charges.

</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Alice Adams, a longtime short story writer  
for The New Yorker and a novelist whose ``Superior Women'' became a 
best seller, died Thursday at age 72. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Adams, well known for 10 novels and five short story  
collections, had been treated for heart problems earlier in the 
week and apparently died in her sleep, said her editor, Victoria 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
	One more novel, ``After the War,'' will be published next year.  
</P>
<P>
	Her first novel, ``Careless Love,'' was met with mixed reviews,  
but after publishing her first story for The New Yorker in 1969, 
Ms. Adams became one of the magazine's most distinctive voices. 
</P>
<P>
	Her 1975 novel ``Families and Survivors,'' about a woman who  
moves from the South to San Francisco, as Ms. Adams herself did, 
established her as an important literary presence. ``Listening to 
Billie'' followed in 1978, then came the short story collection 
``Beautiful Girl.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Superior Women,'' which traced the lives of five Radcliffe  
women, in 1984 became a best seller. 
</P>
<P>
	Known for her wry perspective on life, Ms. Adams once ruminated  
on the difficulty of writing as one ages: ``Some smart person once 
said that what happens is your critical standards rise, and your 
talent does not necessarily increase in a commensurate way.''

<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Kent Hollingsworth, who shaped The  
Blood-Horse weekly magazine into one of the thoroughbred racing's 
most respected trade journals, died Wednesday at age 69. The cause 
of death was not known. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollingsworth served as editor, then publisher of The  
Blood-Horse from 1963-86. When he became editor, the magazine had a 
circulation of 6,800 and a staff of 30. When he departed as 
publisher 23 years later, the circulation had reached 21,700 and 
the staff numbered 101. 
</P>
<P>
	Under his leadership, the magazine expanded its reputation as an  
authoritative source of information, commentary, statistics and 
analysis on thoroughbred racing and breeding. He wrote the highly 
respected ``What's Going On Here?'' column. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollingsworth also was a lawyer and teacher. In recent years, he  
returned to the practice of law and served as a Distinguished 
Lecturer in equine law in the Equine Industry Program at the 
University of Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
	He began his journalism career as a news photographer and sports  
writer for the Lexington Leader in 1954. He also has authored five 
books. 
</P>
<P>
	Survivors include his wife, six children, a sister and a  
brother.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Kennedy, Cabot &AMP; Co. founder David Paul Kane,  
who named his discount brokerage after John F. Kennedy to appeal to 
Democrats and Henry Cabot Lodge to lure Republicans, died Tuesday 
from complications of a stroke. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	Kane was a former lobster importer and car wash owner who made a  
fortune in the discount brokerage business. He also broadcast stock 
market commentaries for two decades on local KWHY-TV. 
</P>
<P>
	He sold the remainder of his interest in Kennedy, Cabot &AMP; Co. in  
1997 for $155 million to Waterhouse Investor Services Inc., the New 
York brokerage arm of Canadian banking giant Toronto-Dominion.

<P>
	BOISE, Idaho (AP) -- Ed Peterson, inventor of the alarm that  
beeps to warn people when trucks and heavy machinery are backing 
up, died Wednesday. He was 78. 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson also invented collapsible luggage carriers, home  
security alarms and automotive electrical devices. 
</P>
<P>
	In the mid-1960s, he invented the Bac-A-Larm, marketing it  
initially to international construction and engineering giant 
Morrison Knudsen Corp., which, like Peterson's company, was based 
in Boise. 
</P>
<P>
	The system is used worldwide now, and the company he founded  
with his brother, Peterson Rebuild and Exchange Co., or Preco Inc. 
as it is known today, is the world's largest supplier of reverse 
warning systems.

<HEADLINE>  NATO Insists Milosevic Is Losing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Charles Wald was reviewing yet another F-16  
fighter jet's video tape of yet another 2,000-pound NATO bomb 
turning yet another Serb army barracks into yet another fireball in 
Kosovo -- yet more evidence, he claimed, that NATO is winning and 
Slobodan Milosevic is losing. 
</P>
<P>
	``You've got to wonder how much more he can take,'' mused the  
Air Force major general in what sounded like a hint of frustration. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, after more than nine weeks of bombing, what more can  
NATO do, short of a ground war, to break the Yugoslav leader? 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic's indictment by a United Nations tribunal for  
atrocities in Kosovo might make Milosevic even less likely to 
capitulate, retired Marine Corps Lt. Gen. Bernard Trainor said 
Thursday. That, in turn, raises the likelihood that NATO will have 
to go beyond airstrikes alone, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	If NATO cannot break Milosevic's will to resist, what then? At  
some point, many argue, the cumulative damage from bombing Serbia 
end to end will virtually paralyze Serb military and police forces 
in Kosovo. They will lose the ability to fight effectively either 
the Kosovo Liberation Army or a NATO-led international force that 
might enter Kosovo to return refugees to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain is making a case to its NATO partners -- without complete  
success, so far -- that when this point is reached, a NATO-led force 
on Kosovo's perimeter could move in and finish off the Serb 
military without resorting to full-scale warfare. They say it could 
be done by summer's end, in order to get the hundreds of thousands 
of displaced ethnic Albanians back into their villages before the 
onset of winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Trainor, who co-authored ``The Generals' War,'' on the 1991 Gulf  
War, called the British approach ``clever and very doable,'' 
although the NATO force should assume the Serbs would not just roll 
over. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. intelligence officials claim Milosevic's military advisers  
have told him they could hold out against a NATO-led ground force 
for months by using guerrilla tactics of hit-and-run attacks in 
Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic is spending much of his time in bunkers supplied with  
food, water and electricity, according to American intelligence 
reports that say he has lost touch with the reality of conditions 
facing the Serb population. 
</P>
<P>
	Wald, too, wonders if Milosevic's military commanders are giving  
him the full picture of the bomb damage, but he doubts it would 
make much difference even if they did tell him how badly Serbia is 
being pummeled. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a lot more willing to sacrifice his people and  
capabilities,'' Wald said. ``So once again, it's hard to judge his 
will, but it certainly isn't hard to judge how much of his 
capability is being destroyed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the Clinton administration still hopes Milosevic will  
cave -- either agree to NATO's demands or simply to give up and pull 
his troops out of the southern Serbian province, allowing the 
refugees to return under the protection of a peacekeeping force. 
</P>
<P>
	In pursuit of that aim, NATO warplanes are accelerating the pace  
of attacks and taking the war closer to Milosevic. On several 
recent days, NATO bombs have targeted a presidential villa outside 
Belgrade that includes what Wald called a command and control 
bunker. Milosevic apparently was not there, but Wald said the 
attacks would alert him to the fact that NATO is hitting hard at 
his levers of power. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the NATO bombing began in March, many in the Clinton  
administration had believed that bombing threats alone would bring 
Milosevic back to the bargaining table to settle the Kosovo crisis. 
When that didn't happen, they expected that a few days or weeks of 
bombing would do the trick. Wrong again. 
</P>
<P>
	As far back as April 6, Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said of  
Milosevic: ``He's rattled.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Six days later, Wald proclaimed: ``He's starting to hurt.''  
</P>
<P>
	On April 27, the NATO commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, said: ``The  
noose ... is tightening.''	   And on May 24, NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana told an 
interviewer Milosevic was ``cracking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Dennis Reimer, the soon-to-retire Army chief of staff, said  
in an interview that he had doubts from the outset that air power 
alone would achieve NATO's political goals. More than nine weeks 
into the campaign, it remains unclear how close NATO is to pushing 
Milosevic over the edge, Reimer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You just don't know if you're an hour away from him  
capitulating or whether you're months away,'' said the four-star 
general. ``And so that's the difficulty that I think everybody has 
in this whole thing.''

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stock prices have opened modestly higher in  
early trading. The Dow Jones industrial average is ahead 20 points 
in today's early going. Advancing issues on the New York Stock 
Exchange hold a 3-2 lead over losers. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq Composite Index is up 13 points and the Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 Index is up five points. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts are looking for light pre-holiday trading today.  
Technical analysts say the market doesn't appear close to 
experiencing a wash-out, because volume has been relatively thin 
this week, as the market has experienced volatility. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, the Dow industrials average suffered its worst  
decline of the year so far, in what traders describe as a market 
fueled by inflation fear. 
</P>
<P>
	On the economic slate, the Commerce Department reports that  
personal income rose 0.5 percent in April, while spending 0.4 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	That indicates while the economic remains vibrant, at least one  
measure of savings remains quite low. 
</P>
<P>
	The bond market is steady. The price of the 30-year Treasury was  
unchanged, while the benchmark yield stood at 5.84 percent.

<HEADLINE> Scottish Soccer Rivalry Resumes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GLASGOW, Scotland (AP) -- Authorities hope to prevent any  
resumption of violence when this city's bitter soccer rivals meet 
in Saturday's Scottish Cup final. 
</P>
<P>
	Glasgow Rangers, bidding to add the championship to the league  
title and League Cup championship they have already won, go up 
against Glasgow Celtic, which is completing a disappointing season. 
</P>
<P>
	It will be the fifth time the teams have played this season with  
each side winning once and two matches ending in draws. 
</P>
<P>
	The last game, won by the Rangers 3-0 at Celtic Park to clinch  
the league title, was nasty. 
</P>
<P>
	Referee Hugh Dallas handed out three red cards and crowd  
violence was directed at him, with a coin thrown from the stands 
striking him in the head. More than 100 people were arrested, 
including three Celtic fans who ran onto the field. The next day, a 
mob attacked Dallas' home in Glasgow. 
</P>
<P>
	Dallas will be the referee again for Saturday's game.  
</P>
<P>
	Security at neutral, 52,000-seat Hampden Park will be unusually  
tight, with opposing fans segregated. The game has an early 3 p.m. 
start to cut down drinking time. Rangers' fans are mostly 
Protestant, while Celtic supporters are mainly Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
	Hampden Park, hosting its first game since a $100 million  
refurbishment, has been fitted with 58 closed-circuit television 
cameras to monitor the stadium and surrounding streets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want a repeat of the scenario which developed last  
time,'' said Celtic captain Tom Boyd. ``But all that matters is 
getting our own game right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This will be the 13th time the two so-called ``Old Firm'' rivals  
have met in the Scottish Cup final and Celtic has won the last 
three -- all 1-0. Celtic holds a 7-5 edge in Scottish Cup finals 
against Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
	Celtic has had a miserable season, with injuries and early exits  
from European Champions Cup qualifying and the UEFA Cup. The season 
highlight was a 5-1 drubbing of Rangers on Nov. 21.

	Rangers captain Lorenzo Amoruso knows a victory would make  
Celtic's season. But he knows how important the game is to the 
Rangers, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``It will be really hard because Celtic will be desperate to  
stop Rangers winning everything,'' Amoruso said. ``But we are 
desperate as well. Coping with the pressure could be the key to the 
game, neither side wants to lose the game and each wants to give 
the other a bad time.''

	Giovanni Van Bronckhorst, who came to the Rangers this season on  
a $8.4 million transfer from Feyenoord, is hoping for a 
trouble-free final. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a lot riding on this game and both sides will stand  
up to each other and give it their best,'' he said. ``Everyone just 
hopes that the troubles off the pitch are not repeated.''

<HEADLINE> Man in Wash. Standoff Found Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SHORELINE, Wash. (AP) -- A man fleeing a hit-and-run freeway  
accident ran to a house and attacked two women Friday, killing one 
and breaking the other's neck, authorities said. He barricaded 
himself in a second house and died in a shootout with police. 
</P>
<P>
	The man was found dead at about 8:45 p.m., eight hours after the  
standoff began, King County Sheriff Dave Reichert said. 
</P>
<P>
	Police in the nearby town of Brier said the slayings of a woman  
and a young boy earlier in the day were connected to the gunman, 
who was not identified. Police did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Police were called to the area by a neighbor who heard a woman  
scream. When officers arrived, a man holed up in a nearby house 
began firing. 
</P>
<P>
	Two women, both in their 60s, were assaulted in the yard outside  
a home, possibly with a garden tool, police said. One was 
bludgeoned to death, and the other was in critical condition with a 
broken neck. 
</P>
<P>
	SWAT teams converged on the scene and helped evacuate nearby  
homes. Students in a nearby elementary school were ordered to stay 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
	The house where the man was holed up contained a large number of  
weapons and he fired dozens of shots before he died, officers said. 
Reichert said his officers responded with just one sniper's shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sad thing and it's a tough decision to make,'' Reichert  
said. ``But in this case it was the right thing to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A female deputy was in serious condition with a fractured skull  
and cuts on her face apparently suffered when a bullet struck her 
vehicle, said Larry Zalin, a spokesman for Harborview Medical 
Center in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses told police they saw the suspect jump out of his car  
and run into the neighborhood after his car struck Anthony Venegas' 
motorcycle on Interstate 5 and caught fire. Venegas, 64, lost his 
left leg in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The accident and standoff forced police to close I-5 in both  
directions at the start of the evening rush hour for the holiday 
weekend.

<HEADLINE> Parcells Tells Jets To Keep Heads </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. -- In the wake of the Jets' 23-10 loss to the  
Denver Broncos in the AFC title game in January, coach Bill 
Parcells has heard all the breathless forecasts about his club's 
potential for the coming season. 
</P>
<P>
	His response? Big deal.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's so much bull,'' Parcells said Friday of the favorable  
predictions about the Jets' chances, especially following the 
retirement of Denver quarterback John Elway. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's part of the game, I know that. I don't look at the  
prognostications with a degree of resentment, but I also know what 
it represents, and that's nothing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The veteran coach has history on his side. Of the 10 losers of  
AFC title games from 1988 to '97, only one team -- the 1994 
Pittsburgh Steelers -- reached the conference title game the 
following year. Additionally, seven of the clubs failed to get past 
the following year's wild-card round, and four failed to reach the 
postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	With that in mind, Parcells told players earlier in the week  
that they should not ``be seduced by expectations.'' Of the six 
teams favored to win division crowns last season, he stressed, only 
one, the Broncos, actually did. The coach also has delivered 
motivational jabs to players coming off impressive seasons, 
including quarterback Vinny Testaverde and wide receiver Wayne 
Chrebet. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told Vinny, `You could be like chickens falling off a cliff,  
Testaverde, falling off so fast,' '' Parcells said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Shoot, he told me that there wouldn't be a parachute big  
enough if I fell off the cliff anytime,'' said the undersized 
Chrebet, a record-setting performer despite his 5-foot-9 build. 
</P>
<P>
	Testaverde, who last year at this time was waiting for the  
Baltimore Ravens to release him, has taken Parcells' jabs to heart. 
Despite rebounding with the Jets to post record-setting numbers en 
route to the Pro Bowl, he's wary of taking anything for granted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any of us who thought at all about skipping a day of working  
out, running or whatever, I think he's let us know that won't be 
acceptable,'' Testaverde said. ``I think you have to have high 
expectations, but it has nothing to do with what you did a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just because we went to the AFC championship has no bearing on  
expectations. When I was in Tampa early in my career, I came in 
with high expectations every year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jets, coming off their first AFC East crown and only their  
second berth in the AFC title game since the AFL-NFL merger in 
1970, are expected to be Super Bowl contenders thanks to a roster 
bolstered by free agent additions including free safety Steve 
Atwater, tight end Eric Green, linebacker Roman Phifer and punter 
Tom Tupa. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't allow my team to get caught up in that,'' Parcells  
said. ``I know what these kids have been hearing all winter. I know 
because I've been hearing the same thing. People walk up to me all 
the time saying, `This is the year.' 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't allow yourself to really begin to believe that. I  
just told the team, `We're starting over.'''

<HEADLINE> Michigan Investigating Booster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANN ARBOR, Mich. (AP) -- The University of Michigan is  
investigating allegations that a booster had dealings with men's 
basketball players after he was banned from associating with the 
team in 1997, according to newspaper reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Provost Nancy Cantor said Thursday that a four-member faculty  
committee would review athletic department reforms begun in 1997 as 
a result of an NCAA-mandated probe of Ed Martin's contacts with 
former players and coaches, the Detroit Free Press reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The school also will review safeguards implemented by the  
athletic department. 
</P>
<P>
	Cantor said athletic director Tom Goss requested the review last  
week after published reports about a federal investigation of 
whether Martin -- a Ford Motor Co. retiree -- ran an illegal numbers 
operation at Detroit-area Ford plants. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of that probe, the FBI reportedly is examining whether  
Martin gave large amounts of cash and loans to several former 
Wolverines players, dating to the Fab Five era in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Published reports have suggested that wiretaps recorded  
conversations between Martin and several former Wolverine 
standouts, including Chris Webber, Louis Bullock, Robert Traylor 
and Maurice Taylor, according to a person familiar with the 
investigation. School officials have said the FBI told them that no 
evidence had surfaced of gambling on Wolverines games. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to make sure the policies are tough enough and make  
changes if necessary,'' Ms. Cantor said. ``We believe we put in 
place very strong policies, but we want to make sure they are 
working.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cantor told The Ann Arbor News Thursday that she hopes to get  
the committee's initial report within a month. She will then 
discuss it with Goss and Marvin Krislov, the university's vice 
president and general counsel. The committee is being chaired by 
Jerome Miller, an adjunct professor of psychology at the school and 
director of the Center for the Child and the Family. 
</P>
<P>
	Other members include Suellyn Scarnecchia, assistant dean for  
clinical affairs in the law school; Derrick Gragg, the school's 
NCAA rules compliance coordinator; and Paul Edwards, an attorney in 
the office of the general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee arises in the wake of new concerns over Martin's  
activities. Federal authorities searched his home on April 28. 
Agents from the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service, who also 
raided 11 other homes that day, seized more than $150,000 in cash, 
10 handguns and gambling paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
	A person familiar with the investigation told the Free Press  
that among the points the committee will examine are whether Martin 
has been seen around the team since he was banned in March 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin was a target in a 1997 investigation of the university's  
basketball program that prompted his being banned, Goss' firing of 
coach Steve Fisher and minor NCAA sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	School President Lee Bollinger said he and Goss decided to take  
another look at the procedures after learning about the federal 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``On these sorts of matters, you can never rest,'' Bollinger  
said.

	Milosevic Meets With Russian Envoy  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Russia's Balkan envoy met  
face-to-face with Slobodan Milosevic for nine hours today, 
declaring the Yugoslav president key to a Kosovo peace plan despite 
complications caused by his indictment for war crimes. Viktor 
Chernomyrdin again urged a pause in NATO's bombing campaign to give 
peace negotiations a chance. But his U.S. counterpart was critical 
of the effort, emphasizing the Russian sponsored proposal 
represents Moscow -- not the alliance. Meanwhile, NATO took 
advantage of good weather to hit a wide range of targets on its 
66th day of airstrikes.

	Pakistan Celebrates Nuclear Tests  
</P>
<P>
	ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Pakistan celebrated the one-year  
anniversary of its nuclear tests today against a backdrop of 
blistering artillery duels and downed Indian aircraft on its 
volatile Kashmir frontier with neighboring India. Giant posters 
proclaimed Pakistani scientists as ``nuclear heroes.'' President 
Rafiq Tarar warned India against further escalation of hostilities 
in the disputed Kashmir region, where Pakistan said it shot down 
two Indian jet fighters yesterday. India says it will continue its 
operations to flush out Islamic militants, who New Delhi charges 
are backed by Pakistani troops.

	No N. Korea Nuclear Violations Found  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State Department said today that a U.S.  
inspection of a complex in North Korea yielded no evidence that the 
nation is in violation of a 5-year-old nuclear agreement. Spokesman 
James P. Rubin also said that while special envoy William Perry did 
not meet with North Korean President Kim Jong Il, his delegation 
was ``well received'' in Pyongyang. Addressing speculation that 
nuclear-related equipment might have been moved out before U.S. 
inspectors arrived, Rubin said, ``It was at a stage of construction 
prior to the time when any relevant equipment other than 
construction equipment would be expected to be present.''

	Judge Upholds Late-Term Abortion Ban  
</P>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- A federal judge ruled today that a  
Wisconsin law that bars a type of late-term abortion is 
constitutional. In his ruling, the judge said the law, aimed at 
what critics call ``partial-birth abortions,'' does not place an 
undue burden on women and that the state does have a valid interest 
in banning the procedure. Under the law, doctors who perform the 
procedure would be subject to first-degree murder charges and life 
in prison if convicted. Patients would not be punished.

	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Florida socialite Stephen Fagan pleaded  
guilty to kidnapping today and was spared a prison term after 
admitting he abducted his two daughters 20 years ago and told them 
their mother was dead. Under the deal, Fagan, who invented a life 
for himself and his girls in Florida, was fined $100,000. The money 
will be given to a Boston orphanage, a charity chosen by his 
ex-wife, Barbara Kurth. The daughters, Rachael and Lisa Martin, now 
25 and 22, thanked their father in court for his sacrifices.

the state's new speed limit. Once the only state without a daytime 
speed limit, Montana's status as an American autobahn ended at dawn 
today when a 75 mph limit took effect. Fines start at $20 for up to 
10 mph over the limit; the maximum is $100 for speeds of 106 mph

	PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) -- The government is investigating  
reports that an incursion of Colombian guerrillas has frightened 
Panamanian villagers into fleeing their homes, officials said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Government Minister Mariela Sagel and Police Chief Jose Luis  
Sosa flew Friday to the Puerto Obaldia region, where Panama borders 
Colombia along the Atlantic Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
	Local newspapers have reported that Kuna Yala Indians from the  
area have been fleeing their villages because of men presumed to be 
Colombian rebels. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said they have not been able to confirm an incursion,  
but national education director, Mirna Vallejos, said teachers and 
students from the Puerto Obaldia area had been relocated due to 
fear of a guerilla incursion.

	LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Customs agents seized four pre-Incan mummies,  
pre-Incan tapestries, ceramics, baskets and fishing nets set to be 
smuggled to Miami, customs officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The artifacts were found Thursday in a container along with a  
1982 truck set to be shipped from Lima's port of Callao, customs 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	National Culture Institute specialists said customs officials  
became suspicious of the container when they noticed that its cargo 
-- the truck -- was valued at $455, less than a third of the cost of 
the export duties. 
</P>
<P>
	Peru suffers from widespread looting of its archaeological  
sites, with much of the loot smuggled abroad. It was the home of 
the pre-Columbian Inca, Moche, Chavin and Nazca cultures. 
</P>

	Many of the cultures sacrificed young people to the gods, and  
the remains were preserved by dry desert or cold mountaintop

South American nations. 
</P>
<P>
	Peru has 15,000 police protecting Sayako, also known as Princess  
Nori, an Interior Ministry spokesman said. Sayako is the only 
daughter of Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko.

	ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) -- Former dictator Alfredo Stroessner

	Stroessner, now 85, was toppled in a February 1989 coup that  
ushered in the restoration of democratic rule in this South 
American nation. The former strongman has lived in exile in Brazil 
for the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Enrique Riera, the ruling party deputy, told local television  
that Stroessner continues to carry the honorific title despite his 
ouster and exile. ``The party never expelled him,'' he said.

	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- President Andres Pastrana on Friday  
pledged tougher controls on a massive southern region where all 
government troops were withdrawn to facilitate peace talks with 
leftist guerrillas.

<P>
	The commitment comes two days after a widely respected political  
veteran resigned as defense minister to protest Pastrana's refusal 
to set a time limit on the military evacuation from Colombia's 
southern zone. 
</P>
<P>
	Emerging from an all-day session with the military high command  
at an army base in the central state of Tolima, Pastrana defended 
his decision while promising to establish clear ``rules of the 
game'' governing rebel activities in the 16,200 square-mile zone. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's never been a (successful peace) process in the world  
that has put a deadline on the negotiations,'' Pastrana said.

	Pastrana has yet to name a replacement for former Foreign  
Minister Rodrigo Lloreda, who stepped down Wednesday over what he 
called excessive government concessions to leftist rebels.

<P>
	Guerrero state police said the driver apparently became drowsy

	The two members of Duncan Dhu, Mikel Erentxun and Diego Vasallo,

<HEADLINE> Morgan Stanley Suspends Two </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Morgan Stanley Dean Witter has suspended two  
executives in connection with a $10,000 payment to a police 
informant whose information helped lead to the arrest of a former 
employee. 
</P>
<P>
	The executives, who were not identified, were suspended with pay  
pending the outcome of an investigation, the firm announced 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan Stanley, the nation's largest securities firm, said it  
had made a ``mistake in judgment'' last year when it paid a 
middleman, Charles Joseph Luethke, to help set up a police sting 
operation against Christian Curry. 
</P>
<P>
	Curry had been fired and was contemplating filing a  
discrimination claim against the firm when the sting was arranged. 
</P>
<P>
	The firm had maintained Curry was fired for expense account  
abuses. Curry said it was because he is black and was thought to be 
homosexual because nude photos of him appeared in a gay men's 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
	Curry, 25, was arrested last summer by undercover police who  
said they had caught him conspiring to plant racist e-mail in the 
firm's computer system, apparently to support his planned 
discrimination case. 
</P>
<P>
	Luethke, a college acquaintance of Curry's, had tipped the firm  
to the alleged e-mail scheme, and then put Curry in touch with a 
computer hacker -- actually an undercover police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors have said Morgan Stanley wired $10,000 into an  
account for Luethke within days of Curry's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	After learning of the payment, prosecutors last week dropped the  
charges against Curry. 
</P>
<P>
	Curry filed a discrimination and wrongful arrest lawsuit last  
week against Morgan Stanley. He is seeking $1.35 billion in 
damages. 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's statement, signed by Morgan Stanley's chairman,  
Phillip J. Purcell, and chief executive, John J. Mack, pledged the 
firm's commitment to cooperate with the investigation. Purcell and 
Mack said they did not know about the payment to Luethke 
beforehand.

<HEADLINE> Rios in Hunt for First Grand Slam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Marcelo Rios' chances of winning a Grand Slam seem  
best on the red clay of Roland Garros. 
</P>
<P>
	And the way he is playing right now, this could be the year.  
</P>
<P>
	In three sets of top quality clay-court tennis between the two  
best players on the surface in 1998, the ninth-seeded Chilean was 
too strong for Spain's Albert Costa on Friday, winning 7-5, 6-4, 
7-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Rios faces another Spaniard, Alberto Berasategui, in the next  
round. 
</P>
<P>
	For some, he is the tournament favorite.  
</P>
<P>
	``If I had to pick one player to win, it would be Rios,'' said  
Tim Henman, the British No. 7 seed. ``He is playing really well at 
the moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former world No. 1 is in fine form on the European clay  
court circuit, with title wins at the German Open and in St. 
Polton, Austria after struggling to overcome injury problems early 
in the year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm feeling much better than last year,'' he said. ``I have  
played three matches in straight sets, which for sure will help me 
at the end if I keep winning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rios has stacked up 14 career titles, but a Grand Slam still  
eludes him. His best performances came in 1998, when he was 
runnerup at the Australian Open and a quarterfinalist at the French 
Open. 
</P>
<P>
	No one doubts his ability, but some believe that the often surly  
Chilean doesn't have the right temperament to win a Slam. 
</P>
<P>
	Rios frequently complains of boredom on the circuit and gripes  
about having to give press conferences after each match. 
</P>
<P>
	For four consecutive years, French journalists at Roland Garros  
have awarded him the Lemon Prize -- given to the most unlikable 
player on the circuit. 
</P>
<P>
	But his match Friday made it clear that he is determined not to  
wait much longer for a Grand Slam. 
</P>
<P>
	Against Costa, he was dogged throughout, most evidently when he  
won the vital eighth game of the third set. 
</P>
<P>
	Trailing 3-4, he made impossible gets at the back of the court  
before hitting a powerful backhand winner at full stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	Costa had his best chance of making a breakthrough in the third  
set, playing a brilliant winner to break serve and take a 4-2 lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Rios applauded that shot -- but broke back immediately before  
taking the set, 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
	His match-winning shot was typical -- a cracking forehand taken  
on the rise that wrongfooted the Spaniard. 
</P>
<P>
	``I played really offensively today, I think I got it right  
tactically,'' Rios said. 
</P>
<P>
	Facing Costa so early in the tournament was a stiff test for  
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Once I saw the draw, I knew it would be tough in the third  
round,'' Rios said. ``Costa has always been one of the greatest 
clay court players.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Costa proved second best, and toward the end was screaming  
to himself in frustration.

<HEADLINE> Turkish President OKs Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- Turkey's president approved a new  
coalition government Friday, bringing together leftists and 
far-right nationalists two decades after violence between the 
groups left thousands dead and prompted a military coup. 
</P>
<P>
	The approval gives Turkey a strong executive in time for  
Monday's opening of the trial of Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah 
Ocalan, which many fear will spark violent protests by Kurds 
throughout Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	The far-right Nationalist Movement Party, a strong opponent of  
minority rights for Turkey's Kurds, is returning to power for the 
first time since the 1980 coup. Veteran leftist politician Bulent 
Ecevit is the new premier. 
</P>
<P>
	The nationalists and leftists joined in rejecting any compromise  
with Ocalan's rebels, who are fighting for autonomy for Kurds in 
Turkey's southeast. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecevit's Democratic Left Party held on to many key positions,  
keeping Ismail Cem as foreign minister and appointing a senior 
party member, Hikmet Sami Turk, as justice minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationalist leader Devlet Bahceli was appointed deputy prime  
minister. 
</P>
<P>
	``May this bring good things for our country, for our nation,''  
Ecevit said after meeting with President Suleyman Demirel. 
</P>
<P>
	Ecevit, who turns 74 Saturday, is best remembered for ordering  
the 1974 invasion of Cyprus. It is his fifth term as prime 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
	To form the new government, Ecevit's supporters and the  
nationalists had to overcome a decades-old dispute stemming from 
street clashes between their two groups in the late 1970s. The 
violence left several thousand dead and prompted the military 
takeover. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the strong ideological divide, many Turks hope the new  
coalition, which also includes the center-right Motherland Party, 
will be long-lasting. 
</P>
<P>
	Turkey has seen the collapse of five weak coalition governments  
since its 1995 elections. Ecevit's coalition commands a strong 
majority in parliament with 351 deputies in the 550-seat chamber. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Friday, the coalition partners announced their program --  
a mix of nationalism and secularism. 
</P>
<P>
	The government promised to maintain a ban in public offices and  
schools on Islamic-style head scarves, which the secular 
establishment views as a challenge to Turkey's secular principles. 
</P>
<P>
	The government faces its first test Monday, when it will have to  
manage the national and international repercussions of the Ocalan's 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Ocalan, captured in mid-February, faces the death penalty on  
charges of treason. 
</P>
<P>
	The three party leaders have agreed to immediately introduce a  
bill that would reform Turkey's state security courts, a move to 
avert criticism during Ocalan's trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The European Human Rights Court -- based in Strasbourg, France --  
maintains the courts, whose three-member panels include a military 
judge, are not independent.

<HEADLINE> Az. Motorola Expansion Moves Ahead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHANDLER, Ariz. (AP) -- A $90 million Motorola expansion, delayed  
by a slump in the semiconductor industry, is about to go ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola said Thursday it is beginning construction that's  
expected to add about 500 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	``When completed (in 2002), the Chandler facility will be our  
largest manufacturing campus in the world,'' said William Seiferth, 
chief of staff for Motorola's Semiconductor Products Sector. 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion will triple the number of processors,  
microcontrollers and other devices made in Chandler. 
</P>
<P>
	During the past year, under pressure of the Asian economic  
crisis and the related semiconductor slump, Motorola eliminated 
2,075 jobs in metro Phoenix. Analysts say the slump has bottomed 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	Motorola, the world's No. 3 chip manufacturer, already has  
completed basic construction of the buildings on the 80-acre 
campus. As part of the $1.1 billion expansion, Motorola said it 
will now spend $50 million on robots and other technology to fully 
equip its new plant. Some equipment is already in, and production 
has begun in the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Motorola will spend $40 million to complete the interior  
construction of another building. Plans call for installing 
heating, piping, gas lines and other equipment. The building then 
will be equipped next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Work is to begin in the next few weeks.  
</P>
<P>
	The expansion project has already created about 60 jobs and is  
expected to add 60 more by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of Motorola's furloughed employees will not be eligible to  
rejoin the company since most accepted voluntary severance packages 
that prevent them from returning to work for the company for two 
years.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Manager a National Hit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NISHINOMIYA, Japan (AP) -- In a nation beset by economic gloom,  
Japan could use a hero now. And it may have found one in Katsuya 
Nomura, the potbellied, grim-faced manager of perhaps the country's 
worst baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
	Nomura's appeal is his reputation for pulling victory out of  
defeat. And that's a talent most of Japan, stuck in its worst 
recession since World War II, longs for these days. 
</P>
<P>
	The popularity of Nomura, in his first season as manager for the  
Hanshin Tigers, is hard to miss. First, are the beer commercials. 
Then there are the T-shirts, key chains and pens. There are even 
tea, wine and box lunches with a Nomura motif. 
</P>
<P>
	``Manager Nomura can stop the recession,'' gushed a recent  
headline in the Sankei, a major newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	A study by the Sakura Institute of Research, a Tokyo think tank,  
found that the economic lift from Nomura's Tigers was phenomenal, 
totaling more than $107 million -- through rising game attendance, 
hotel revenue from out-of-town fans, not to mention the sales of 
newspapers and magazines carrying the latest on the Tigers as well 
as the Nomura-theme goods. 
</P>
<P>
	It doesn't hurt that the Tigers, the perennial losers, are  
having a great season -- surging to second place in the six-club 
Central League and stirring hopes they may even win the pennant. 
</P>
<P>
	For several years, Nomura has been seen as more than just a  
baseball guru in a team-oriented nation that stresses the group 
over the individual. 
</P>
<P>
	In an annual survey of young government workers, Nomura has for  
the past three years been rated one of the top five people they 
would most like to work for. 
</P>
<P>
	He was No. 1 in 1994, a year after his former team, the Yakult  
Swallows, won the Japan Series, the nation's equivalent of the 
World Series. 
</P>
<P>
	``The people here love him,'' said Tigers third baseman Mike  
Blowers, an American import who has played with the Los Angeles 
Dodgers, Seattle Mariners and Montreal Expos. 
</P>
<P>
	When Nomura accepted his job as Tigers' manager, the 63-year-old  
portrayed himself as an older man just trying to hang on -- like so 
many others in a workforce increasingly characterized by downsizing 
and voluntary retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	``I consider it a privilege to be wanted in my 60s,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	The story of Nomura's life is a rags-to-riches Japanese dream.  
When Nomura was 3, his father was killed in a war with China. From 
then on, Nomura grew up in a poor, single-parent home. 
</P>
<P>
	A struggled as a catcher in the pros.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was beaten so many times by my coaches because I didn't look  
like I was trying,'' he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	But he emerged in the 1950s as one of the country's greatest  
players. He was the MVP five times and Triple Crown winner in 1965, 
and led his league in home runs for nine seasons. He remains second 
on the career home run list with 657, trailing Sadaharu Oh. 
</P>
<P>
	His reputation for leading underdogs to victory started with his  
previous club, the Yakult Swallows. 
</P>
<P>
	Until Nomura arrived in 1990, the Swallows won the Japan Series  
only once in the series' five-decade history. They won it three 
times under Nomura. 
</P>
<P>
	A typical Nomura-style game -- like Japanese management in  
general -- isn't all flash and home runs. It's more about smarts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes it's hard to understand his decisions while you're  
playing,'' Tigers infielder Hiroshi Yagi said. ``But later, you 
really see his point. I think he's fantastic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese believe that club managers -- as well as corporate  
bosses-- set the tone for the entire group. And it is team effort, 
never individual heroism, that leads to victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Books on baseball, newspaper articles and TV commentators often  
break down Nomura's strategy, likening it to corporate management 
styles. 
</P>
<P>
	So great has Nomura's popularity grown that even his wife has  
been catapulted to TV and lecture-circuit stardom. The flamboyant 
Sachiyo is also gossiped about on talk shows and is followed by 
cameras wherever she goes. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, not everyone is sure Nomura can magically turn around the  
Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter how brilliant he is, it's the players who have to  
play the game,'' said Keiji Masui, a fan of the Tokyo Yomiuri 
Giants, the Tigers' longtime rivals. ``It'll be a while yet before 
the Tigers win the pennant.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Buzz Calkins has to have one of the more  
creative excuses for skipping class. 
</P>
<P>
	Forget those weak whines of ``I overslept'' or ``I didn't feel  
well.'' When Calkins isn't pursuing his MBA at Northwestern's 
Kellogg School of Management, it's because he's on a track 
somewhere, going around and around at 200 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``Professors have been pretty understanding on trying to get me  
ahead of the game or whatever,'' he said. ``Catching up shouldn't 
be too big of a problem. Just means a lot of work, I guess.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calkins, who will start in the ninth row in the Indianapolis 500  
on Sunday, has missed several classes the last few weeks as he gets 
ready for Indy. But with exams coming up next week, he left 
Indianapolis after Carburetion Day on Thursday and was back in 
class Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been one of the things that I kind of decided I'm going  
to pay attention to that when I get back,'' he said. ``Get this 
finished and then worry about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The logical question might be, why even bother? With at least  
nine races a year and career IRL winnings of more than $1.4 
million, Calkins can probably afford to slack off for a few years. 
Why not race for a while and then go back to school? 
</P>
<P>
	But Calkins, 28, said this is the right time in his life to do  
it. 
</P>
<P>
	``This isn't the most secure sport in the world and if things,  
for some reason, don't go my way, I just want to be prepared and be 
able to go in that direction,'' said Calkins, who earned 
undergraduate degrees in economics and history from the University 
of Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, his ``day job'' makes him a big man on campus. Most of  
his classmates who work are investment bankers or consultants, 
pretty tame stuff compared with open-wheel racing. 
</P>
<P>
	Calkins is scheduled to get his MBA a year from now, but he  
doesn't plan to jump into the business world just yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Racing is still a first priority,'' he said. ``As long as this  
is still working out, going in the direction we want it to go, then 
I'll continue to do this. I'll play it by ear after that.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WINLESS RAY:* Now that Tony Stewart has jumped to NASCAR, what  
young driver has a chance to develop into an Indy Racing League 
star? 
</P>
<P>
	Many observers mention the man who replaced him with Menard  
Racing, but there's a catch: Greg Ray has yet to win a race. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my first full season and I've had a lot of successful  
races and I haven't won,'' Ray said. ``I will feel more complete 
after I win. And I will have earned it when it comes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 32-year-old driver has demonstrated that he's one of the  
fastest racers on the circuit, starting the Indy 500 from the 
middle of the first row for the second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first two IRL races of the year, he started second in  
Orlando, Fla., and from the pole in Phoenix, only to finish 21st 
both times. Mechanical problems doomed him in Orlando, while a 
wreck ended his day in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	Ray's best showing was second in a 1998 race in Texas. He's had  
only one other top-10 finish in 16 IRL events. 
</P>
<P>
	``I found every possible way not to get to Victory Lane,'' Ray  
said. ``But there's no question about it, we need to get there 
soon. I don't ever want to talk about things you haven't done. And 
that's all we've been talking about lately. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's embarrassing that people keep talking about winning and I  
haven't done it yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ray, who struggled to find sponsorship last season, is now  
driving for the well-financed Menard team, taking the seat once 
occupied by Stewart. That has only heightened the comparisons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't have anything against Tony,'' Ray said. ``I have a lot  
of respect for his ability as a race driver. I just don't want to 
hear his name anymore.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NOT SO FAST:* No matter how many times they hear it, laying off  
the gas at the start of the Indianapolis 500 isn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
	The 33 cars do three warm-up laps before taking the green flag  
at full speed. The drivers have already been told countless times 
they need to take it easy on the flying start, and they're sure to 
get one more warning Saturday at the meeting with Brian Barnhart, 
the Indy Racing League's director of racing operations. 
</P>
<P>
	But when it comes time to go racing, all those cautions tend to  
go right out the window. 
</P>
<P>
	``As soon as we get strapped in, the adrenalin gets going and  
the brain becomes disconnected from the right foot,'' said Billy 
Boat, who will start from the outside of the first row. ``The 
challenge is not to let that happen.''

<HEADLINE>  Sabres' Hasek Ready for Game 4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Dominik Hasek skated briefly on Friday,  
performed a few pirouettes and other assorted goalie maneuvers, 
then uttered some words the Toronto Maple Leafs didn't necessarily 
want to hear. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel exactly the same way I felt against Ottawa,'' the  
Buffalo Sabres' star goalie said. ``Once the puck was dropped, I 
didn't think of my injury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not the most encouraging words for the Maple Leafs, who trail  
2-1 in the Eastern Conference finals entering Saturday night's Game 
4. 
</P>
<P>
	Against the Senators in the first round, Hasek had one shutout  
and allowed six goals as the Sabres captured three one-goal games 
and swept the best-of-7 series. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek, who sat out the first two games against the Maple Leafs  
when his chronically injured groin became too painful to play, 
returned to the lineup Thursday night after the Leafs had rallied 
for a 6-3 victory in Game 2 and sparked the Sabres to an important 
4-2 win. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to go on the ice,'' said Hasek, who made 24 saves,  
including three crucial stops in the third period before Curtis 
Brown's empty-net goal in the final minute secured the victory. ``I 
don't like the days off. I like to feel the ice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There might be more to feel than ice in Game 4 at Marine Midland  
Arena. After Brown's goal, Toronto coach Pat Quinn set out tough 
guys Tie Domi and Kris King to stir things up and they did. A 
mini-melee broke out in the closing seconds after Domi skated 
through Hasek's crease and bumped him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't bother me too much,'' said Hasek, who retreated to  
the safety of the dressing room when things threatened to get out 
of hand. ``I got mad for a couple of seconds. Maybe I said 
something. But after a couple of seconds I'm focused on the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the culmination of a night of attempted intimidation by  
the Maple Leafs against Hasek, who prevented them from tying the 
game in the third period with key stops in close on Sergei Berezin, 
Steve Thomas and Mats Sundin. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's emotions were running high at the end,'' said  
Sabres coach Lindy Ruff, who initially called Quinn's tactics 
``classless'' and then toned down the criticism Friday. ``When I 
was down 4-1 the other night, there were some evil thoughts inside 
my head, too. I was angry about what went on on the ice, that Domi 
ran into Dom's legs. I don't think there was vicious intent. I just 
didn't like it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Quinn, there was not much to like about his defense, either.  
It collapsed under the forechecking pressure of the Sabres, 
allowing a shorthanded goal by Joe Juneau and the Sabres' 13th 
power-play goal of the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive lapses on the same play by Sylvain Cote and Daniil  
Markov in front of Toronto goalie Curtis Joseph, and another by 
Bryan Berard allowed Miroslav Satan and Juneau to transform a 1-0 
deficit into a 2-1 lead in a matter of seconds early in the second 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	``Next game we'll have to play for 60 minutes,'' said Yanic  
Perreault, who scored the first Toronto goal on only the third shot 
of the game by the Maple Leafs. ``Every goal's going to be huge.''

<HEADLINE>  Sabres' Hasek Ready for Game 4 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Dominik Hasek skated briefly on Friday,  
performed a few pirouettes and other assorted goalie maneuvers, 
then uttered some words the Toronto Maple Leafs didn't necessarily 
want to hear. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel exactly the same way I felt against Ottawa,'' the  
Buffalo Sabres' star goalie said. ``Once the puck was dropped, I 
didn't think of my injury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not the most encouraging words for the Maple Leafs, who trail  
2-1 in the Eastern Conference finals entering Saturday night's Game 
4. 
</P>
<P>
	Against the Senators in the first round, Hasek had one shutout  
and allowed six goals as the Sabres captured three one-goal games 
and swept the best-of-7 series. 
</P>
<P>
	Hasek, who sat out the first two games against the Maple Leafs  
when his chronically injured groin became too painful to play, 
returned to the lineup Thursday night after the Leafs had rallied 
for a 6-3 victory in Game 2 and sparked the Sabres to an important 
4-2 win. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to go on the ice,'' said Hasek, who made 24 saves,  
including three crucial stops in the third period before Curtis 
Brown's empty-net goal in the final minute secured the victory. ``I 
don't like the days off. I like to feel the ice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There might be more to feel than ice in Game 4 at Marine Midland  
Arena. After Brown's goal, Toronto coach Pat Quinn set out tough 
guys Tie Domi and Kris King to stir things up and they did. A 
mini-melee broke out in the closing seconds after Domi skated 
through Hasek's crease and bumped him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't bother me too much,'' said Hasek, who retreated to  
the safety of the dressing room when things threatened to get out 
of hand. ``I got mad for a couple of seconds. Maybe I said 
something. But after a couple of seconds I'm focused on the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was the culmination of a night of attempted intimidation by  
the Maple Leafs against Hasek, who prevented them from tying the 
game in the third period with key stops in close on Sergei Berezin, 
Steve Thomas and Mats Sundin. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's emotions were running high at the end,'' said  
Sabres coach Lindy Ruff, who initially called Quinn's tactics 
``classless'' and then toned down the criticism Friday. ``When I 
was down 4-1 the other night, there were some evil thoughts inside 
my head, too. I was angry about what went on on the ice, that Domi 
ran into Dom's legs. I don't think there was vicious intent. I just 
didn't like it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Quinn, there was not much to like about his defense, either.  
It collapsed under the forechecking pressure of the Sabres, 
allowing a shorthanded goal by Joe Juneau and the Sabres' 13th 
power-play goal of the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Defensive lapses on the same play by Sylvain Cote and Daniil  
Markov in front of Toronto goalie Curtis Joseph, and another by 
Bryan Berard allowed Miroslav Satan and Juneau to transform a 1-0 
deficit into a 2-1 lead in a matter of seconds early in the second 
period. 
</P>
<P>
	``Next game we'll have to play for 60 minutes,'' said Yanic  
Perreault, who scored the first Toronto goal on only the third shot 
of the game by the Maple Leafs. ``Every goal's going to be huge.''

<HEADLINE> MCI WorldCom Buys Skytel for $1.3B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- MCI WorldCom Inc. is buying the pager company  
SkyTel Communications Inc. for nearly $1.3 billion in stock, 
announcing the deal just days after the companies scuttled rumors 
they were discussing a merger. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom said Friday it would pay stock worth $21.24 for  
each share of SkyTel, partially filling a gaping wireless hole in 
an otherwise broad list of telecommunications businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom, the nation's No. 2 long-distance phone company and  
a major owner of the circuitry that makes up the Internet, will 
also absorb about $525 million in debt from SkyTel, which is one of 
the few profitable companies in the paging industry. 
</P>
<P>
	While the purchase represents a major foray into the wireless  
business, the equipment and the part of the radio spectrum used by 
paging networks aren't good for carrying voices or high-speed data. 
</P>
<P>
	So for now, MCI WorldCom essentially remains a non-player in the  
wireless calling market, reselling other cellular services under 
its own name to a small number of customers. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, shares of SkyTel shot higher after an Internet  
service named Company Sleuth reported that MCI WorldCom had 
reserved the Web site domain name ``skytelworldcom.com.'' 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom quickly played down the significance of that move,  
saying it routinely reserves domain names that might have value, 
and that the registration for the SkyTel-related name was the work 
of an overzealous employee. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement announced Friday comes amid a frenzy of  
deal-making that's reshaping the communications industry, with 
phone companies like Bell Atlantic and GTE merging and AT&AMP;T 
spending about $100 billion on cable TV properties it plans to use 
for phone calls and Internet access. 
</P>
<P>
	For MCI WorldCom, the SkyTel deal comes after two failed  
attempts to buy its way into the $33 billion wireless 
communications industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Just weeks ago, talks to acquire Nextel Communications, the  
largest independent wireless company, unraveled after the companies 
failed to agree on price. In January, MCI WorldCom dropped out of a 
bidding war to buy AirTouch Communications. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom didn't rule out a future acquisition, but didn't  
disclose any specific plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see a lot of opportunity for growth in the overall wireless  
market, and over time, we expect to be a broader participant in 
that market,'' said Frank Walter, a spokesman for MCI WorldCom. 
</P>
<P>
	SkyTel and MCI WorldCom, both based in Mississippi, have  
long-standing business ties. MCI WorldCom is the largest reseller 
of the SkyTel's messaging services. 
</P>
<P>
	SkyTel, with about 1.6 million customers, has been a leader in  
the move toward two-way pagers that enable customers to exchange 
messages directly with other pagers or via the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	MCI WorldCom president and chief executive Bernie Ebbers said  
the acquisition is an important building block in the company's 
overall wireless strategy. 
</P>
<P>
	``SkyTel is the industry leader in wireless messaging, and is  
ahead of the curve in developing and implementing wireless data 
applications,'' said Ebbers. ``SkyTel also brings a talented 
management team with a wealth of experience in wireless 
communications.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, expected to be completed in six to nine months, was  
announced after the close of financial markets Friday. Shares of 
SkyTel rose $1 to $20.31 1/4, while shares of MCI WorldCom rose $1.43 3/4 
a share to $86.37 1/2, both on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> M.D. Had Concern About Lewis' Heart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- A California cardiologist who examined Celtics  
captain Reggie Lewis after the player received two drastically 
different diagnoses in Boston said in testimony played in court 
Friday that he concluded Lewis had an abnormal heart. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Nicholas Diaco of St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica,  
Calif., said he shared those concerns with Lewis' lead doctor, 
Gilbert Mudge. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said he appreciated my comments and would watch Reggie  
closely,'' Diaco said of Mudge in videotaped testimony at the 
malpractice trial stemming from the All-Star's subsequent death at 
27 while shooting baskets in July 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis' widow, Donna Harris-Lewis, filed a malpractice suit  
against Mudge and two of his consultants, claiming they 
misdiagnosed and mistreated her husband. The plaintiff's side 
rested on Friday, and the defense was expected to begin Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis had gone to Diaco and three other Los Angeles-area  
physicians for the third opinion after collapsing during a playoff 
game in April 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	The first opinion, from a ``Dream Team'' of doctors at New  
England Baptist Hospital, had been grim: Lewis had a 
life-threatening, potentially career-ending heart condition. 
</P>
<P>
	The second opinion, from the widely respected Mudge, was far  
less serious: Lewis had a neurological ailment that causes fainting 
spells. 
</P>
<P>
	Diaco testified that he believed Lewis had the neurological  
condition -- but that it couldn't ``explain away'' all of his 
symptoms and test results. Diaco said he told this to Mudge, who 
never wavered publicly from his assertion that Lewis was relatively 
healthy and could play professional basketball again. 
</P>
<P>
	While Diaco testified he warned Mudge of his concerns about  
Lewis' heart, under questioning by Mudge's attorney he admitted he 
never advised that Lewis receive an implanted defibrillator -- which 
the plaintiff's attorney has suggested would have saved Lewis' 
life. 
</P>
<P>
	``When Mr. Lewis left (California), did you feel he was at risk  
for sudden death?'' asked lawyer William Dailey Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think it was a significant risk, no,'' Diaco replied.  
</P>
<P>
	``If you had, you certainly wouldn't have let him leave here,  
would you?'' Dailey added. 
</P>
<P>
	``No,'' Diaco said.

<HEADLINE> Restrictions on Lotteries Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Members of the national gambling study  
commission were breezing through proposals for their report on 
American gambling when one paragraph stopped them cold. 
</P>
<P>
	It praised the American Gaming Association, the casino industry  
lobby. All eyes fell upon AGA President Frank Fahrenkopf Jr., who 
was in the audience. 
</P>
<P>
	``How did he get hold of a typewriter?'' quipped Commissioner  
William Bible. 
</P>
<P>
	No, Fahrenkopf and his casino clients did not write the  
commission's report. But their handiwork is apparent. 
</P>
<P>
	The report, which the commission will finish next week in San  
Francisco, proposes restrictions on state lotteries. It criticizes 
Native American casinos for being secretive. It discourages 
racetracks from installing slot machines. 
</P>
<P>
	But it mainly steers clear of the most spectacular symbols of  
legalized gambling: the hulking, showy, laser-lit, buffet-fed, 
up-all-night casino resorts of Atlantic City, N.J., Las Vegas and 
the Mississippi Gulf Coast, along with smaller casinos on land and 
rivers in seven other states. 
</P>
<P>
	The casino industry feared the commission would urge the federal  
government to take over gambling supervision from the states and 
impose new federal taxes on gambling. Neither idea came to pass. 
</P>
<P>
	The commission also rejected proposals that would have forced  
casinos to stop issuing credit, to send profit and loss summaries 
to patrons and to impose daily loss limits on bettors. For now, the 
most objectionable part of the report, Fahrenkopf said, is its call 
for an end to legalized betting on collegiate sports. 
</P>
<P>
	So did casinos get kid-glove treatment?  
</P>
<P>
	To the contrary, insists Fahrenkopf: ``We were looked at  
harder'' than the other forms of gambling. He credits the industry 
with ``being out front'' on issues like helping addictive gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
	But others see politics at work.  
</P>
<P>
	When Congress created the National Gambling Impact Study  
Commission in 1996, casino heavyweights lobbied congressional 
leaders and the White House to appoint members friendly to their 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The result: Of the nine commissioners, three have worked in and  
around Las Vegas casinos -- Bible, former chairman of the Nevada 
gaming control board; MGM Grand Chairman J. Terrence Lanni, a 
member of the AGA board of directors; and John Wilhelm, national 
president of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union. 
</P>
<P>
	All three say they approached their work with open minds. But  
Bernard Horn, who has followed the commission for the National 
Coalition Against Legalized Gambling, said he believes they ``made 
it their priority to protect the Vegas casino industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James Dobson, the commission's most unyielding critic of  
gambling, agreed that the casino industry got results by making 
sure some of its friends were appointed. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, Dobson said casinos also had a strong case on  
the merits. He believes casino resorts, to which people travel, are 
less worrisome than state lotteries, Internet betting and 
neighborhood slot machines that bring the temptation of gambling 
close to where people live. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea that people choose to travel to casinos was a point the  
casino lobby hammered home at every opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
	Casino operators formed the AGA in 1994 after President Clinton  
broached the notion of a federal gaming tax. It now has about 120 
member companies, including casino hotels, riverboat casinos and 
casino suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Fahrenkopf, a former chairman of the Republican National  
Committee, the association's strategy for dealing with the federal 
gambling commission had three parts: co-opt, cooperate and 
choreograph. 
</P>
<P>
	Knowing it was vulnerable on the issue of pathological gambling,  
the casino industry in 1996 co-opted the issue by creating the 
National Center for Responsible Gaming, which funds research into 
addiction. By the time the commission considered compulsive 
gambling, the industry could boast it was helping to solve the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
	The casino association cooperated by making sure its members all  
completed a survey circulated by the commission to learn more about 
casino finances. 
</P>
<P>
	And the casino industry choreographed shows of strength during  
the commission's on-site visits to casino towns. 
</P>
<P>
	At a meeting in Mississippi, casinos were praised as stellar  
corporate citizens by the executive director of the Boys and Girls 
Clubs of the Gulf Coast, Biloxi's superintendent of schools and a 
representative of the Catholic Diocese. 
</P>
<P>
	Fahrenkopf said he knew the report would include cautionary  
tales of gambling addiction. What he sought was equal time. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you have the bad stories, you have to balance it with the  
good,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Angola Slides Towards a Catastrophe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAURIMO, Angola (AP) -- Almost 40,000 newcomers to this crumbling  
rural town huddle in the shade and plead for food, just a fraction 
of those fleeing a renewed civil war that is pushing Angola into 
humanitarian crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Since fighting resumed in December, rebels trying to oust the  
government have overrun the countryside, forcing 1 million Angolans 
to flee to already overburdened government-held cities. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, this southwest African nation has been sliding  
toward a catastrophe -- unnoticed by Western nations gripped by the 
war in Yugoslavia and the plight of hundreds of thousands of ethnic 
Albanian refugees. 
</P>
<P>
	The Angolan government and aid workers in Saurimo, some 620  
miles east of the capital, Luanda, say they cannot cope with the 
influx of displaced people into the town and that the entire nation 
is on the brink of collapse. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't the means to set up another camp for the  
displaced,'' Antonio Malomalo, the local delegate of the Ministry 
for Social Assistance said. ``We've got no food or tents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rebel group UNITA -- a Portuguese acronym for the National  
Union for the Total Independence of Angola -- appears to have 
adopted scorched-earth tactics. The rebels blow up bridges, mine 
roads and burn entire villages. 
</P>
<P>
	``UNITA arrived and started shooting, hacking and setting fire  
to everything. We just scattered,'' said Venancio, a village elder 
from Tchissambue, describing a UNITA attack on his village. 
</P>
<P>
	Venancio said he led a group of about 20 women and small  
children on the 90-mile trek to Saurimo. He didn't know what had 
happened to the rest of the village's residents. 
</P>
<P>
	By triggering a wave of displaced people, the rebels apparently  
aim to throw Angola into chaos and force the collapse of the 
government, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
	Angolans have seen more than three decades of war -- starting in  
1961 when they began fighting for independence from Portugal. When 
they won it in 1975, they turned on each other. Since then, there 
have been just five years of uneasy peace. 
</P>
<P>
	Saurimo was once the thriving capital of a diamond-mining region  
near the border with Congo. 
</P>
<P>
	Now it has no running water or electricity and most of its  
residents live in adobe or straw huts. The influx of refugees has 
doubled the population, aid workers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels surround the town, choking off supplies. The only way  
for the U.N. World Food Program to bring food is by plane, under 
constant threat from rebel surface-to-air missiles. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the WFP's efforts, only 9,000 of the almost 40,000  
displaced people in a camp on the edge of town are receiving food. 
The rest must get by as best they can. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no official figures for the number of deaths, but  
already many are succumbing to disease because they are weak and 
undernourished. 
</P>
<P>
	Aid agencies have only about of a quarter of the $110 million  
they need this year, prompting the United Nations to plan an urgent 
international appeal in June. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's no quick response to our new appeal, there's no  
doubt that we'll have a humanitarian catastrophe in Angola,'' 
warned Fernando Freire, spokesman for the U.N. Humanitarian 
Assistance Coordination Unit.

<HEADLINE> Dutchman To Fly Last Time at Indy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- In this Year of the Retirement, Arie  
Luyendyk is the first to admit he doesn't quite measure up to 
Michael Jordan, John Elway or Wayne Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those guys are legends,'' the Flying Dutchman said, looking a  
bit embarrassed to even be mentioned in the same class. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, at 45, he has a chance to end his racing career  
epitomizing the passion of Elway, the grace of Jordan and the class 
of Gretzky. 
</P>
<P>
	Luyendyk has the best seat in the house for the start of the  
Indianapolis 500 on Sunday. The two-time winner will be on the pole 
when the green flag falls, once again showing a group of cocky kids 
-- one is half his age -- how to get around the 2.5-mile speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	No one knows how things will unfold for those next three-plus  
hours, but Luyendyk has a vision of how it ends. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll take one last lap around the track, wiping away tears  
while the memories wash over him. Then, he'll turn left into 
Victory Lane, gulp down some milk and say goodbye to it all. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be unbelievable to finish my career off like that,''  
Luyendyk said Friday. ``It's almost too much to ask for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Luyendyk is fading away on his own terms, announcing his  
retirement before the Indy Racing League season but coming back for 
the 500 one last time. 
</P>
<P>
	He's hardly some washed-up athlete, hanging on beyond his prime  
and clinging to his former glory. It was only two years ago that he 
won his second Indy 500. Last weekend, he claimed the pole with a 
speed of 225.179 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Though his wavy, brown locks are tinged with gray and a few  
wrinkles have crept onto his face, Luyendyk still seems suited for 
life in the fast lane. 
</P>
<P>
	He was trim, tanned and dapper for his final news conference  
before his final Indy, adorned in a white shirt, black pants and 
shoes, with a checkered-flag ring on his left hand -- the one all 
Indy champions wear. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still competitive when I get in the car. I could probably  
be competitive for the next couple of years,'' Luyendyk said. 
``Eventually, I'm going to lose some of my timing, some of my 
reflexes. I don't want to discover that in the race car.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Luyendyk wasn't a huge winner on the Indy-car circuit. Saddled  
for many years with under-financed teams and slow cars, he captured 
only seven victories during his 15-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure I would have won a lot more race with a team like  
Penske or Newman-Haas,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But, in spite of a road-racing background in Europe, Luyendyk  
always seemed to have a knack for Indy, where he holds the record 
for career winnings at more than $5.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
	He won for the first time in 1990 with an average speed of  
185.981 mph -- the fastest 500 in history -- then took the checkered 
flag again seven years later. He finished in the top 10 four other 
times and set a qualifying record in 1996 with a four-lap run of 
236.986 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	``Either you get it or you don't,'' Luyendyk said. ``For some  
reason, I just clicked with this track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He'll drive one last time surrounded by the overwhelming respect  
of those around him. Even A.J. Foyt, who decked Luyendyk in Victory 
Lane during a disputed race in Texas two years ago, gushes praise 
for this European who seems so different than himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we can't win the race,'' said Foyt, a four-time winner who  
now runs his own team, ``I hope he does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Foyt laughs now as he recalls Luyendyk charging into the  
winner's circle ``like a Texas bull'' -- seemingly out of character 
for the humble, genteel driver. But that sort of outburst didn't 
surprise other drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has a tremendous temper on the racetrack,'' 1996 Indy 500  
winner Buddy Lazier said. ``I remember when he flipped off a 
driver, knocked his headrest off and the whole field went yellow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Luyendyk doesn't think the emotions will be overwhelming after  
Sunday's race, since he's already gotten used to the idea of 
retirement by sitting out the IRL's first three races of the 
season. He worries more about next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's when it's going to hit me,'' he said nervously.  
</P>
<P>
	But Luyendyk doesn't waver at all on his decision to retire.  
He's tired of packing his bags week after week. Never again does he 
want to awaken in the hospital after a hard crash, unsure of where 
he is. 
</P>
<P>
	These days, he's as happy lounging on his boat as he is sitting  
behind the wheel of a race car. He wants to spent more time with 
his wife, Mieke, and his four children at his adopted home in 
Scottsdale, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me, the risks and the rewards just don't pay off anymore,''  
Luyendyk said. 
</P>
<P>
	Luyendyk is not retiring completely. He might race in the 24  
Hours of LeMans. He'll continue to serve as a TV analyst for IRL 
races. He's got plenty of sponsorship commitments to keep him busy. 
</P>
<P>
	There are no regrets.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy with the way my career went,'' Luyendyk said. ``I  
just want to be remembered as a regular guy who stayed that way, 
despite his success. I didn't become someone totally different than 
I was.''

<HEADLINE> Lindros Given Clean Bill of Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Philadelphia Flyers center Eric Lindros has  
recovered from the collapsed lung he suffered last month and has 
been officially cleared to play hockey again. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's looking great and doing great, and he's back to his  
playing weight'' of 236 pounds, Dr. Larry Kaiser, chief of thoracic 
surgery at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros suffered the collapsed right lung April 1 in a game  
against Nashville, and did not play the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides meeting with doctors, Lindros and his agent and father,  
Carl, were in Philadelphia for a two-hour meeting with Flyers 
chairman Ed Snider. Officials from either side declined to comment 
on the franchise center's contract status. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindros has a handshake agreement for a one-year, $8.5 million  
contract extension with Philadelphia, but can be a restricted free 
agent July 1. The Flyers would have the right to match any offer.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Close Sharply Lower / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Fears that America's economic boom may be faltering  
sent Japanese stock prices sharply lower today. The dollar 
retreated against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 204.51 points,  
or 1.26 percent, to finish the day at 15,972.68. On Thursday, the 
Nikkei index shed 53.33 points, or 0.33 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 120.52 yen, down 1.91 yen from late Thursday  
in Tokyo but above its late New York level of 120.38 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, investors worried about a possible slowdown  
in the U.S. economy following Thursday's plunge in New York stock 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wall Street overnight, the Dow Jones industrial average sank  
235.23 points to 10,466.93, its worst single-session decline of the 
year and its lowest level since April 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Tokyo stock prices fell sharply in the morning as investors  
dumped export-oriented shares such as telecommunications and 
electronics issues after their U.S. counterparts fell. 
</P>
<P>
	But in the afternoon domestic institutional investors began  
buying shares seen as having strong earnings potential, pulling the 
market off its lows. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market is at a difficult stage,'' said Kunihiro Hatae,  
general manager of stock trading at Tokyo Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Another negative factor was a sharp decline in near-term June  
Nikkei futures prices Thursday on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hideyuki Okoshi, deputy manager at Chuo Securities, said the  
Nikkei 225 was likely, however, to find support between 15,700 and 
15,900 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors were also discouraged by a stronger yen against the  
dollar. A higher yen makes Japanese exports more expensive abroad 
and thus less competitive, cutting into earnings at export-led 
Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was down 10.10 points, or 0.78 percent, to 1,292.07 
points. The TOPIX closed down 1.15 points, or 0.09 percent, 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Activity was sparse as investors grew cautious ahead of the  
Memorial Day holiday Monday in the United States, which will close 
markets there. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange was  
estimated at 416.73 million shares, up slightly 396.41 million 
shares Tuesday. Retreating issues outnumbered advancers 941 to 236, 
while 118 issues were unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar's relative strength from its  
New York levels came as investors hunted for bargains and covered 
short, or oversold, positions. 
</P>
<P>
	The greenback tumbled to a low of 119.70 yen in New York  
overnight -- the first time it broke through the 120-yen mark since 
May 3 -- as market players took cues from the sell-off in the Dow 
Jones industrial average. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 120.22 yen and 120.81 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was traded at 126.08 yen, down  
from 127.58 yen late Thursday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 213 10-year Japanese government  
bond dipped to 1.4900 percent from 1.4950 percent late Thursday, 
driving its price up to 99.21 yen from 99.17 yen.

<HEADLINE> Father Pleads Guilty in Kidnap Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Florida socialite Stephen Fagan pleaded  
guilty to kidnapping Friday and was spared a prison term after 
admitting he abducted his two daughters 20 years ago and told them 
their mother was dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, Fagan, who invented a life for himself and his  
girls in Florida, was fined $100,000. The money will be given to a 
Boston orphanage, a charity chosen by his ex-wife, Barbara Kurth. 
</P>
<P>
	Kurth was in court, but chose not to speak. It was the first  
time she, her daughters and her ex-husband had been in the same 
room together since he kidnapped the girls from her home. 
</P>
<P>
	Fagan received a suspended three-to-five-year prison sentence  
and must serve probation for five years. He also was ordered to 
perform 2,000 hours of community service at the Department of 
Veterans Affairs Medical Center in West Palm Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	Fagan could have been sentenced to 20 years in prison if  
convicted of two counts of kidnapping. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a tragic, difficult and wrenching case for  
everyone who has been victimized by Mr. Fagan's unlawful conduct,'' 
Middlesex Superior Court Judge Peter Lauriat said in accepting the 
plea agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	In a strong, deep voice, a haggard-looking Fagan told the judge  
he took his girls without their mother's consent. 
</P>
<P>
	Rachael and Lisa Martin, now 25 and 22, thanked their father in  
court for his sacrifices. 
</P>
<P>
	``We do not feel victimized by our father,'' Rachael Martin told  
the court. ``We are convinced that his actions were from his 
heart.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In October 1979, Fagan kidnapped his daughters, then 2 and 5,  
from Massachusetts and moved them to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Fagan, 57, who has been free on $250,000 bail, claimed he  
rescued them from an unfit and alcoholic mother. The courts at the 
time, he said after his arrest, didn't look kindly on a father 
seeking custody. 
</P>
<P>
	Kurth, who was divorced from Fagan in 1978, denies the charge  
and said she was suffering from narcolepsy, an illness that causes 
sudden, deep sleep. 
</P>
<P>
	Fagan was living under the assumed name Dr. William Martin when  
he was arrested in his Palm Beach, Fla., mansion last year after 
eluding authorities for 19 years. Authorities had caught up with 
him after Massachusetts state police got a telephone tip that he 
was living in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	At the time of his arrest, Fagan, who had married a prosperous  
land developer, was driving expensive cars and was a member in some 
of the most exclusive clubs in Palm Beach. 
</P>
<P>
	Kurth, now a biologist at the University of Virginia, has been  
unsuccessful thus far in reuniting with her daughters, her lawyer 
has said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some legal observers questioned whether prosecutors would be  
sending the wrong message with such a lenient deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``Kidnapping is a very serious offense and it's not less serious  
because a parent commits the act,'' said Wendy Murphy, a former 
prosecutor and legal analyst. 
</P>
<P>
	Just because the daughters don't want to see their father  
imprisoned doesn't mean Fagan automatically deserves to remain 
free, Murphy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The fact that the kidnaping happened two decades ago doesn't  
lessen the seriousness of what he did, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would have been in a huge pile of trouble had we caught him  
sooner,'' said Murphy, who heads the Victim Advocacy and Research 
Group.

<HEADLINE> Russian Deputy Prime Minister Quits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- In the biggest blow yet to Russian Prime Minister  
Sergei Stepashin, one of his top two deputies resigned Friday less 
than a week after being appointed. 
</P>
<P>
	The resignation of First Deputy Prime Minister Mikhail Zadornov  
marked the second power struggle the new prime minister has lost 
since being appointed by President Boris Yeltsin just over two 
weeks ago, and led to speculation that Stepashin might be next to 
step down. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Zadornov's new post was a promotion, he also had wanted  
to maintain control over the Finance Ministry, which he had headed 
in the past three governments. 
</P>
<P>
	``My stance is that the Finance Ministry should play a key role  
in the government,'' he told reporters, explaining that the 
government needed a ``unified economic bloc'' to realize its main 
economic tasks. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, my position did not find support from the  
president or his administration staff,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, in an interview on NTV television, Zadornov said he had  
not been able to speak directly with Yeltsin about his resignation 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Zadornov had been a strong proponent of reform in the  
government, and he spoke with pride Friday about his ministry's 
achievements, including keeping the government within its budget 
for the past eight months. 
</P>
<P>
	His departure was a visible defeat for Stepashin, whom Yeltsin  
appointed prime minister May 12 after sacking Yevgeny Primakov. 
</P>
<P>
	Stepashin had proposed that Alexander Zhukov, the head of the  
budget committee in the lower house of parliament, be appointed 
first deputy premier in charge of economic policy and that Zadornov 
remain at the helm of the Finance Ministry. Yeltsin rejected that 
recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
	As speculation about his political weakness has grown, Stepashin  
has tried hard to project an air of authority -- although, being the 
fourth prime minister in just 14 months, he knows well that Yeltsin 
can fire him any time. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Friday he delicately confirmed that a behind-the-scenes  
struggle was holding up a final decision on the makeup of his 
government. 
</P>
<P>
	Stepashin, looking grim, asked reporters covering his meeting  
with Norwegian Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik to stop asking 
questions about the drawn-out formation of the Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
	``You know yourselves how it's going,'' he said with a long  
face, confirming at least some of the media speculation about 
infighting among Yeltsin's underlings. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the newspaper Vremya and the Interfax news agency predicted  
that Stepashin might be the next to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	All week long, Russian newspapers and airwaves had buzzed with  
theories about powerful forces at work on the Kremlin's picks for 
key Cabinet posts. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin's daughter Tatyana Dyachenko, business mogul Boris  
Berezovsky and veteran reformer Anatoly Chubais were all believed 
to have a part in the decision-making, at Stepashin's expense. 
</P>
<P>
	The biggest struggle has been over the post of finance minister.  
Initially, last Tuesday, the Kremlin had said Zadornov would stay 
in the post. Later the same day, another official, Mikhail 
Kasyanov, was appointed instead. 
</P>
<P>
	Communist Party chief Gennady Zyuganov said Friday that the  
mixed signals reflected a struggle among Chubais, Berezovsky and 
Yeltsin's family, and called the president ``a hostage to these 
string-pullers,'' Interfax reported. 
</P>
<P>
	``They seem to be at odds about who will take over the best  
Cabinet seats, embezzlement-wise,'' Interfax quoted him as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Vremya noted that the struggle over who would oversee the  
Finance Ministry was over much more than a single Cabinet seat. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, one compact financial-industrial group, elbowing out  
competitors, is getting control in fact over all the key posts in 
the executive,'' the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Vremya was referring to Berezovsky, who appears to be the  
biggest winner in the Cabinet struggle. Yeltsin named a Berezovsky 
protege, Nikolai Aksyonenko, one of two first deputy prime 
ministers, and Aksyonenko has made it clear he'll take as much 
power as he can. Kasyanov and the new customs chief, Mikhail Vanin, 
are also believed to have ties to Berezovsky. 
</P>
<P>
	In his NTV television interview, Zadornov refused to be drawn  
into criticism of any other Cabinet appointments or of the people 
believed to be calling the shots in the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
	``I hope that this whole story will help build up trust in the  
prime minister to do what he's responsible for: leading the 
government,'' Zadornov said.

<HEADLINE> Kodak-Fuji Film Price War Flares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) -- A photographic film price war between  
Eastman Kodak Co. and Japanese nemesis Fuji is flaring up as the 
peak summer season nears, and Kodak appears to be losing ground on 
its home turf once more. 
</P>
<P>
	Kodak insists, however, that its seemingly sharp drop in market  
share in April is no more than a blip in its effort to rebound from 
a 1997 assault by Fuji Photo Film Co. that led to the elimination 
of 19,900 Kodak jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	In the U.S. market, two retail surveys show that Tokyo-based  
Fuji grabbed 5 percentage points in unit sales at Kodak's expense 
during the first four months of 1999. Most of the gains came in 
April. But even with the decline, Kodak still accounts for about 
two-thirds of the rolls of film sold in this country. 
</P>
<P>
	In a business made highly volatile by coupon discounts and other  
promotions, Kodak said a few weeks or even months are too brief a 
period to accurately reflect its market standing. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the supermarket, drugstore and mass-merchant data, tracked  
by ACNielsen Corp. and Information Resources Inc., do not include 
manufacturers' sales and provide only a partial view of the photo 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Any Fuji inroads would be worrisome, however, at a time when  
Kodak seemed to be rebounding from two hard years of price battles. 
Some Wall Street analysts think Kodak will have to lower film 
prices to make up ground. 
</P>
<P>
	B. Alex Henderson of Prudential Securities Inc. noted last week  
in his monthly survey of stores in Philadelphia that Fuji's average 
price per roll of film fell 5.2 percent from April to May while 
Kodak's rose 2.2 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Henderson says the Philadelphia data historically mirror trends  
in the national market. 
</P>
<P>
	Fuji said its recent success is driven by more than just  
discounts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We give the retailers better service and a better deal,'' said  
James Chung, director of financial relations at Fujifilm USA. ``As 
a retailer, you always try to push the product that is more 
profitable to you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, Kodak was initially slow to respond to Fuji's price  
cuts and then had to resort to the most severe cutbacks in its 
history -- hacking off 20 percent of its worldwide payroll of 
100,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Through deep discounts, it had regained nearly all of the market  
share it lost and vowed to counter Fuji more aggressively than 
before. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is clear to me that Kodak will not ignore an increase in  
the price differential of film in the same way they did as a 
company two years ago,'' said one Wall Street analyst whose company 
has a policy restricting employees from being quoted by name. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Chicago-based Information Resources, Kodak's unit  
share of U.S. film sales fell to 67.5 percent in April from 76.5 
percent in early January while Fuji's rose from 17.8 percent to 
22.3 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nielsen survey showed Kodak's unit share of 35mm, disposable  
and Advanced Photo System film sales dropped from 69.6 percent to 
64 percent while Fuji's share jumped from 18.4 percent to 23.4 
percent.

<HEADLINE> Navy May Oppose Shipbuilding Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is likely to recommend that the  
Justice Department oppose Litton Industries Inc.'s proposed $1.8 
billion purchase of Newport News Shipbuilding Inc., Defense 
Secretary William Cohen said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen, in an exchange with reporters, said the Navy had made a  
``preliminary determination'' that the Litton bid for Newport News 
would excessively limit competition in naval shipbuilding. But he 
said the Navy had determined it would not oppose Litton's $500 
million cash offer for Avondale Industries Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	A Litton-Newport News combination would be ``contrary to our  
interests in maintaining separate facilities'' for naval 
shipbuilding, Cohen said. Later he was asked whether the Navy's 
preliminary determination was likely to be the final decision by 
the Pentagon. ``In this particular case, that probably is,'' he 
replied. 
</P>
<P>
	The Litton deal for Newport News would reduce the number of  
companies competing to build most classes of Navy warships from 
three to two. The Navy is concerned that the proposed merger would 
jeopardize the hundreds of millions of dollars in cost savings it 
negotiated with Newport News after a failed takeover bid earlier 
this year by defense contractor General Dynamics Corp., a Navy 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Litton made its bid this month after Cohen rejected General  
Dynamics' offer for Newport News. 
</P>
<P>
	Litton knew there was a possibility that regulators might not  
approve the merger because of concern that cost savings might not 
offset the effects of reduced competition, Litton spokesman Randy 
Belote said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will review these concerns and see if we can satisfactorily  
resolve these issues,'' Belote said. 
</P>
<P>
	Litton believes there are no concerns regarding the Avondale  
offer and has been negotiating with Avondale to try to reach a 
final agreement, Belote said. Avondale specializes in building 
auxiliary and amphibious ships. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport News is the Navy's only builder of nuclear-powered  
aircraft carriers. Litton's Ingalls shipbuilding unit makes 
destroyers and other surface ships. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Newport News plummeted more than 15 percent Thursday  
on reports of the government's concerns falling $5.18 3/4 to $27.56 1/4 
on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
	In midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Litton shares  
were up $2.75 to $65.50. Shares of Avondale were up 43 3/4 cents to 
$36.68 3/4 on the Nasdaq Stock Market.

<HEADLINE> Neb. Abandons Execution Moratorium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- In the final hours of the 1999 legislative  
session, lawmakers chose not to challenge Gov. Mike Johanns' veto 
of a measure that would have made Nebraska the first state to 
legislate a moratorium on executions. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, they voted unanimously Thursday to override his veto of  
a separate bill to study whether the death penalty is applied 
fairly. Executions will not be halted during the study. 
</P>
<P>
	``The moratorium, brothers and sisters, is dead,'' said Omaha  
Sen. Ernie Chambers, a death penalty opponent and co-sponsor of the 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Johanns, a Republican who supports capital punishment, vetoed  
the legislation Wednesday, calling it poor public policy and 
possibly unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation called for a two-year moratorium on executions  
while the study was being done. Death sentences could have been 
issued during the moratorium, but no executions would have taken 
place. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, the Legislature did not even take a vote to override  
the veto of the bill that called for a moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
	Three men have been put to death since Nebraska resumed  
executions in 1994 after a 35-year hiatus. 
</P>
<P>
	Paula Hutchinson, an attorney who represented the three men,  
said the Legislature's decision to study the issue means that 
Nebraska will remain a leader in the search for fairness in death 
penalty law. She said she has no doubt the study will show there 
are serious changes that need to be made. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Judge OKs Late-Term Abortion Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- A Wisconsin law that bars a type of  
late-term abortion, carrying a potential term of life in prison, is 
constitutional, a federal judge ruled today. 
</P>
<P>
	Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin and six physicians had sued the  
state shortly after the law was enacted more than a year ago, 
saying it was unconstitutionally vague, with language so broad that 
it could outlaw other types of abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	In his ruling, U.S. District Judge John Shabaz said the law,  
aimed at what critics call ``partial birth abortions,'' is not 
vague. He also held that it does not place an undue burden on women 
and that the state does have a valid interest in banning the 
procedure. 
</P>
<P>
	``The partial-birth abortion is never medically necessary to  
preserve the health of the woman,'' Shabaz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The legislature did not adopt the act for the purpose of  
placing an obstacle in the path of women seeking an abortion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the law said the ruling would be appealed.  
</P>
<P>
	A federal appellate had blocked enforcement while the case was  
pending. Shabaz continued that injunction as the matter continues 
through the appeals process. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar laws have been fully or partially blocked by courts in  
19 of the 28 states that passed them, according to the New 
York-based Center for Reproductive Law and Policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision came about three hours after attorneys gave their  
closing arguments. 
</P>
<P>
	Roger Evans, a lawyer for Planned Parenthood, said the state's  
case relied on a ``vaporous sense of understanding'' what exactly 
the law is supposed to prohibit. 
</P>
<P>
	The statute is ``vague in the sense that it seems to ban some,  
if not all, of those common (abortion) procedures'' that were not 
specifically targeted by the law, Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Susan Ullman said the law applies to what is  
called dilation and evacuation in medical terms. 
</P>
<P>
	In her closing arguments, Ullman said ``plaintiffs know full  
well that the definition of partial birth abortion in the Wisconsin 
statute only defines (dilation and evacuation) and doctors know 
what that procedure is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The law prohibits an abortion in which a doctor ``partially  
vaginally delivers a living child, causes the death of the 
partially delivered child with the intent to kill the child, and 
then completes delivery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors would be subject to first-degree murder charges and life  
in prison if convicted. Patients would not be punished. 
</P>
<P>
	A physician who challenged Wisconsin's late-term abortion law  
testified Thursday that the statute's language is so vague that he 
cannot tell whether it would send him to prison. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I am going to be subject to going to jail for the rest of  
my life, no, I would not continue to perform abortions,'' Dr. 
Dennis Christensen of Madison said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Dr. Harlen Giles of Pittsburgh, testifying for the state,  
said, ``I've never faced a situation in which (the procedure) was 
medically necessary. I consider it cruel and unusual punishment 
that causes pain to the fetus when it is performed.''

<HEADLINE> Chicago Regains Control of Housing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Four years after atrocious living conditions and  
chronic mismanagement led the federal government to seize Chicago's 
housing projects, they've been returned to city control in far 
better shape. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chicago Housing Authority's management has been overhauled.  
Several high-rise projects have been torn down or remodeled, in an 
attempt to reduce the density of poverty that plagued the city's 
public housing for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, housing experts, community leaders and many residents say  
several issues need to be addressed, and the transformed system may 
have created its own set of problems. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, the housing authority became the biggest agency of its  
kind to be seized by the federal Department of Housing and Urban 
Development. At the time, HUD Secretary Henry Cisneros said 
Chicago's dilapidated and violent projects were ``without question, 
the worst public housing in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to the agency's problems were a series of scandals,  
including allegations that a former board chairman embezzled 
millions of dollars from the authority's pension funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Last August, HUD removed the agency from its list of troubled  
housing authorities, citing improvement in such areas as the 
percentage of vacant apartments, the success of rent collection, 
overall financial management and general maintenance of apartments. 
</P>
<P>
	City and federal officials signed an agreement restoring the  
city's control of the agency and its 62,000 living units on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	HUD Secretary Andrew Cuomo called it a ``vote of confidence in  
the good work'' of the agency and Mayor Richard M. Daley, who has 
appointed a former Chicago public housing resident as its new 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a huge task,'' Daley said. ``We all must be willing to  
experiment and learn as we go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Deborah Young, who has lived in the Robert Taylor Homes on the  
South Side for 15 years, remembers rats and roaches and apathetic 
officials and residents when the city last controlled the system. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was utter chaos. There were no services; the buildings were  
filthy and dangerous. It was as if everything had come to a stop,'' 
Ms. Young said. 
</P>
<P>
	When HUD stepped in, Young said, ``We went from being hopeless  
and traumatized communities to communities with hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Taylor Homes, a four-mile stretch of high-rises, has  
benefited from a $25 million federal grant for rehabilitation. Some 
buildings have been torn down; others have been modernized. HUD has 
also supported job training programs and small business initiatives 
in the complex. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, not everyone considers the agency's development under HUD  
an unequivocal success. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberta Feldman, an urban planner with the University of  
Illinois at Chicago, acknowledges that HUD made CHA management more 
efficient, allowing more money to flow to the housing complexes. 
</P>
<P>
	But many of the challenges remain, including keeping crumbling  
and aging complexes livable, she said. And new problems have 
cropped up with the demolition of 10,000 public housing units in 
Chicago, which are to be replaced with mixed-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Feldman said the city will have difficulty making room for  
the poor in Chicago's limited housing market. ``Many residents are 
feeling anxious about whether they are going to have a home,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Daley's appointment of Phillip Jackson as executive director is  
seen by some as a cause for optimism. Jackson, who has been a top 
administrator for Chicago's school system, replaces Joseph 
Shuldiner, who was sent by HUD to run the Chicago agency in May 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson ``is going to relate to residents and challenge the  
residents,'' said Rep. Danny Davis, a Democrat whose district 
contains about 68 percent of Chicago's public housing complexes.

<HEADLINE> Euro Faalls to New Lows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar eked out gains against the euro  
Friday after the new currency dived to fresh lows despite efforts 
by senior European monetary officials to resuscitate their 
creation. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0418, down  
from $1.0420 Thursday. During trading the euro fell to $1.0396, the 
first time it's fallen below $1.04. The euro has lost 10.7 percent 
since its launch in January and 1 percent for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar rose to 121.43 yen from 120.38 yen, partially  
recovering from a nearly 2-yen fall on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the euro's steady decline since its January launch,  
European officials have mainly said they weren't worried and 
traders paid little heed. But traders paid attention Friday as a 
bevy of officials spoke out. 
</P>
<P>
	In a televised interview over CNN, Germany's central bank  
president-designate, Ernst Welteke, said he was worried about the 
recent decline. ``It has to stop,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder called the euro's  
fluctuations temporary, saying that ``excited reactions are 
completely superfluous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The outgoing president of Germany's central bank, Hans  
Tietmeyer, said ``the euro has every potential to remain a stable 
currency.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't be happy if there was any further decline'' in the  
euro, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro rose as high as $1.0487 while Tietmeyer spoke, as  
traders took the collective comments to mean that the European 
Central Bank was prepared finally to prop up the euro by 
intervening in foreign exchange markets. But investors waited in 
vain. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market in general made some intervention bets and the euro  
in fact has done nothing but drift lower'' to the new lows against 
the dollar, said Ricardo Gomes, head of foreign exchange at 
Republic National Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro started drifting upward in ever-decreasing volume,  
however, as traders went home early ahead of the three-day Memorial 
Day holiday weekend. Markets also will be closed in London for a 
bank holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, the dollar also was quoted at 1.5288 Swiss francs,  
up from 1.5238; and 1.4704 Canadian dollars, down from 1.4751. The 
British pound rose to $1.6003 from $1.5990. 
</P>
<P>
	The currencies of the 11 countries that have switched to the  
euro no longer are traded separately and are tied to the euro by a 
fixed rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on the euro's latest exchange rate, the dollar was worth:  
1.8781 German marks, up from 1.8769; 6.2964 French francs, up from 
6.2933; and 1,858.74 Italian lire, up from 1,858.22.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Auto Exports Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's exports of cars, trucks and buses fell 11.1  
percent in April from a year earlier, as rises in shipments to the 
United States and Asia were more than offset by declines to Latin 
America and the Middle East. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japan Automobile Manufacturers Association said Friday the  
drop to 337,845 vehicles was the third consecutive monthly decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Shipments to crisis-hit Asia rose for the first time in 19  
months as the economies of some countries in the region appeared to 
be bottoming out. Exports to Asia rose 6.2 percent to 23,866 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan's vehicle exports to the United States were also up,  
rising 11.1 percent to 116,898. 
</P>
<P>
	But exports fell sharply to Latin America and the Middle East.  
</P>
<P>
	Latin America-bound exports tumbled 58.9 percent to 18,019  
because of economic troubles in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Exports to the Middle East declined 34.3 percent to 16,972,  
following a deterioration in crude oil prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The April drop in exports followed a 1.9 percent year-to-year  
fall in March and a decline of 4.2 percent in February. 
</P>
<P>
	By automaker, Toyota Motor Corp.'s exports rose 2.9 percent to  
135,692 amid brisk exports to Europe and North America. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyota's European-bound exports were boosted by the Vitz compact  
model, while North-America-bound shipments were helped by the Lexus 
series and the Camry. 
</P>
<P>
	Nissan Motor Co. exports declined 14.7 percent to 42,767, those  
of Honda Motor Co. decreased 12.3 percent to 43,987, and Mitsubishi 
Motors Corp. shipments sank 49.3 percent to 19,447. 
</P>
<P>
	Mitsubishi's exports were hurt by falling shipments to Asia,  
Europe and the United States and as the automaker expanded 
production overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	Mazda Motor Corp.'s exports tumbled 36.4 percent to 30,423.

<HEADLINE> NTSB Wants Military Plane Grounded </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A federal safety panel recommended Friday that  
a type of old military plane used in civilian combat simulations be 
temporarily grounded because it can lose its wings in sharp turns, 
as apparently happened in a recent fatal crash. 
</P>
<P>
	The Beech T-34A, a plane bought by the Air Force in 1950 and  
later used by the Navy as well, appears to be straining under the 
heavy gravity of the turns and dives common in classes in which 
civilians engage in mock combat in planes flown by flight 
instructors. 
</P>
<P>
	The grounding should last until a proper inspection program is  
developed, the National Transportation Safety Board said in a 
letter to the Federal Aviation Administration. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA said it planned to issue an order as early as Saturday  
requiring that a placard be placed in the cockpit of T-34s spelling 
out performance limitations for the plane. It will say that the 
plane's speed cannot exceed 175 mph, that acrobatic maneuvers are 
prohibited and that normal acceleration cannot surpass 2.5 times 
the weight of gravity, or 2.5 Gs. 
</P>
<P>
	As to the recommendation about grounding the planes, FAA  
spokeswoman Diane Spitaliere said, ``We're starting with the 
placards as an immediate action; this was underway before we 
received the NTSB recommendation. We'll review that before deciding 
if any further actions are needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The safety board said excessive ``G-loading'' may have caused  
the right wing of a T-34A to tear off on April 19 over Rydall, Ga., 
sending the plane plummeting to the ground and killing the pilot 
and his passenger. The plane was operated by Sky Warriors Inc. of 
Atlanta. The crash killed retired Delta pilot Floyd ``Ted'' McFann 
Sr., 60, of Alpharetta, Ga., and Delta pilot Daniel Bouck, 51, of 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators found extensive fatigue cracking around the wing  
and in similar areas on the left wing, which remained on the plane 
but was heavily damaged in the crash. The safety board also learned 
that cracks had been found in the lower wing spar of a T-34 
operated by Texas Air Aces of Spring, Texas, although the parts in 
that plane were replaced and discarded prior to the accident in 
Rydall. 
</P>
<P>
	There is at least one other air combat operator, although the  
board did not name the company. 
</P>
<P>
	While Sky Warriors asked its pilots not to engage in dives or  
rolls that created strains exceeding four times the weight of 
gravity, the safety board said a videotape of the fatal flight 
contained a spoken excerpt in which the pilot told the passenger 
they had just made a 4.5- to 5-G turn. One of Sky Warriors' T-34s 
reportedly exceeded 12-G loading during one mission. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane was originally certified to 6 Gs.  
</P>
<P>
	``The safety board has found no other examples of possible  
wing-structure fatigue cracking in the long history of the T-34 
series of airplanes,'' Jim Hall, chairman of the NTSB, wrote in a 
letter to FAA Administrator Jane Garvey. 
</P>
<P>
	``The safety board believes that air combat simulation flights  
may induce a larger number of high positive wing loading events per 
hour than other operations,'' Hall added. ``Considering these 
factors, it is likely that the fatigue cracking on the accident 
airplane was the result of the loading conditions experienced 
during the air combat simulation flights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The board acknowledged that the current certificate-holder for  
the T-34, the Raytheon Aircraft Co., issued a safety communique May 
19 recommending that the planes not be flown until the FAA makes 
any decisions stemming from the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	But Hall said that since the action is not mandatory, the FAA  
should ``immediately restrict from further flight'' all such planes 
used in air combat simulations until an inspection can be 
developed. The safety board also said no more T-34s should enter 
combat simulation service without the upcoming inspection. 
</P>
<P>
	A call to Sky Warriors in Atlanta was answered with a recorded  
message saying the company was not operating pending the outcome of 
the investigation. A message left on the line seeking comment was 
not immediately returned.

<HEADLINE> Harness Driver Brennan Returns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Once the New Jersey Supreme Court  
cleared the way, it didn't take George Brennan long to get back to 
racing and the winner's circle. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's leading harness driver until being suspended in a  
controversial ruling by the New Jersey Racing Commission, Brennan 
got back to work on Friday, driving in six races on the 12-race 
card at the Meadowlands. He had one winner. 
</P>
<P>
	The track sought to bar Brennan while his suspension was being  
reviewed, but the state Supreme Court ruled Wednesday that the 
state-owned track could not do that. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan was suspended by the racing commission on April 10 for  
an unsatisfactory effort in a race on March 10 at Freehold Raceway, 
a race in which an investigation found some questionable betting. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to be back racing,'' Brennan said after his third  
drive. ``I just really appreciate the trainers sticking by me, it 
means a lot to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As he said that, the emotion was evident in Brennan's eyes and  
voice. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan's win came in the 10th race, when he had a perfect trip  
with Maxwells Champ, taking the lead in the stretch and barely 
holding off Palmer Seelster at the wire. The winner paid $32.20. 
</P>
<P>
	In his first race back, Brennan finished third with Our  
Commitment. Just prior to the race, a fan near the outside apron of 
the track held up a banner, welcoming the driver back and wishing 
him luck. 
</P>
<P>
	``It just felt good to be out there making a living again,''  
Brennan said. ``The fans treated me great. The one guy was out 
there with the sign, and it was great knowing the fans and my 
fellow colleagues were behind me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The one difference Brennan noticed was that his hands felt a  
little weak after six weeks of not handling horses, which weigh 
about 1,000 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I should be all right after about 15 or 20 races,'' said  
Brennan, who drove in a couple of qualifying races on Friday 
morning, winning one. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan was 13th and last in the third race when Southwind  
Miranda broke stride shortly after the start. The 32-year-old was 
seventh in both the fifth and ninth races. He finished fifth in the 
11th race, his final drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan was suspended based on his drive of My Dream Come True  
at Freehold Raceway on March 10. The racing commission ruled that 
``the drive was unsatisfactory due to a lack of effort'' and cited 
its rules against ``fraudulent or unsatisfactory driving'' and 
``conduct detrimental to the sport.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brennan had his finest season in 1998, finishing third with 172  
winners in 1,200 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of Brennan's drives on Friday developed because Catello  
Manzi was unable to drive because of an injury sustained at 
Freehold on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court probably won't rule for at least two months on  
whether the Meadowlands has the right to bar Brennan, so it is 
likely he will be able to race through the end of the current meet, 
which ends in early August.

<HEADLINE> Cat Thief Looking for First '99 Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- D. Wayne Lukas is still trying to find the right  
race for Cat Thief, and he's hoping Saturday's Metropolitan Mile at 
Belmont Park is it. 
</P>
<P>
	Cat Thief, third in the Kentucky Derby and seventh in the  
Preakness, has failed to win in his last seven starts, and has just 
two wins in 13 career races. This year, the colt is 0-for-6. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the one-turn mile at Belmont is a perfect fit for  
him,'' Lukas said. ``We have the weights in our favor, Jerry Bailey 
up, and a perfect fit for our horse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $500,000 Met Mile allows for 3-year-olds to receive a weight  
allowance against older horses, and Cat Thief will carry 111 pounds 
compared to the 118-pound, high-weighted Affirmed Success. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Cat Thief doesn't have many victories on his resume,  
the speedy son of Storm Cat has come close just about every time. 
Before his tough trip in the Preakness, the William T. Young-owned 
colt posted two second-place finishes and four third-places in his 
previous six races, 
</P>
<P>
	Cat Thief, a stablemate of Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner  
Charismatic in Lukas' barn, was just a co-third choice at 5-1 in 
the morning line, behind 2-1 favorite Affirmed Success. Sir Bear 
was the second choice at 7-2 in a formidable field of eight. 
</P>
<P>
	Affirmed Success is making his second start after a seven-month  
layoff. In his only start this year, he was a strong second to 
Artax on a day the winner broke a 30-year-old track record for 7 
furlongs at Aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Trained by Richard Schosberg, Affirmed Success is 4-for-4 at  
Belmont Park. Jockey Mike Smith will be aboard the 5-year-old gray, 
who won four of eight races in '98. 
</P>
<P>
	Lil's Lad, who bled in the May 1 Churchill Downs Handicap, has  
been training well the past few weeks and trainer Neil Howard is 
optimistic his 4-year-old is back in top form. Lil's Lad, also 5-1, 
will be ridden by Joe Bravo. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest of the field includes Rock and Roll, winner of the  
Churchill Downs Handicap; Lord Grillo, Crafty Friend and Liberty 
Gold. 
</P>
<P>
	Lukas, who will be inducted into racing's Hall of Fame in  
August, is going for his fourth Met Mile win. His three winners 
were Gulch, Honour and Glory and Criminal Type. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very prestigious race and the breeders love it,''  
Lukas said. ``Cat Thief is a homebred that they hope to stand one 
day, and if we get lucky and win it, it will dramatically affect 
his career at stud.''

<HEADLINE> House Panel Eyes Teen Abortion Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A woman who helped her grandson's girlfriend  
get an abortion says a House panel should reject a proposal that 
would make it harder for teens to get abortions because women like 
herself could wind up in jail. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please don't pass this law,'' an emotional Billie Lominick of  
Newbury, S.C., urged the House Judiciary constitution subcommittee 
at a hearing Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lominick's state requires a parent's consent before an  
abortion can be performed on a minor. She said the 16-year-old 
girl, Mary, had been abused by her parents and feared involving 
them after learning about her pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lominick said she helped get the girl to Georgia for an  
abortion after attempts to petition the courts for permission for 
the operation failed. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had not been with her, I don't know where she'd be  
today,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill would make it a federal misdemeanor for someone other  
than a parent or guardian to transport a minor out of state for an 
abortion if doing so would violate parental consent or notification 
laws in the child's home state. 
</P>
<P>
	But Eileen Roberts, of Fredericksburg, Va., was in favor of the  
bill. She said she didn't realize her 14-year-old daughter had had 
an abortion until she needed hospitalization for depression and 
$27,000 in follow-up medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am here today to ask this committee to reject the eccentric  
notion that any adult stranger has the right to abduct our 
minor-aged daughters and take them to another state for a secret 
abortion,'' said Mrs. Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
	She said an adult friend drove the girl 45 miles away from home  
for the procedure. Virginia requires that parents be notified when 
minors seek abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., the panel's chairman, said the  
proposal's purpose is to uphold parental involvement laws in effect 
in more than 30 states. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters also say it would protect vulnerable girls from being  
spirited away by the self-serving, older men who get them pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill died in the Senate last year after passing the House by  
less than the margin required to overturn a threatened White House 
veto. 
</P>
<P>
	Canady said it was appropriate for Congress, with its powers to  
regulate interstate commerce, to pass such legislation. ``The 
safety of young girls and the rights of parents demand no less,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., criticized the proposal as a  
``thinly veiled attempt to chip away at a constitutionally 
protected right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Abortion rights groups also oppose the bill, arguing that girls  
similar to the one in Mrs. Lominick's case may be forced to seek 
unsafe abortions instead of seeking the help of a friend when they 
are afraid to confide in their parents. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The bill is H.R. 1218.

<HEADLINE> VW Said To Plan French Bugatti Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRAUNSCHWEIG, Germany (AP) -- It may have lost last year's battle  
for the Rolls-Royce nameplate to rival BMW, but Volkswagen isn't 
giving up on luxury cars. 
</P>
<P>
	VW chairman Ferdinand Piech told a newspaper that the ``people's  
car'' company planned to revive the legendary Bugatti marquee at a 
new factory to be built in Molsheim, France -- where the original 
Bugattis were made. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first Bugatti model should be finished by the end of the  
year 2002,'' Piech was quoted as saying by the Braunschweiger 
Zeitung for its Saturday editions. ``We'll attack Rolls-Royce with 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bugattis were first built in Molsheim in 1909 and quickly gained  
fame with spectacular successes on European racetracks. The firm 
stopped making cars in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
	VW bought the rights to the nameplate last year for an  
undisclosed sum. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the newspaper, VW plans to invest at least $56  
million to build a new factory on the original site. About 200 
people will be employed building the exclusive cars with 
high-powered, 18-cylinder engines, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Volkswagen showed a prototype Bugatti coupe at last year's Paris  
auto show and a four-door limousine in Geneva in March. At the 
time, it said no decision had been made whether to produce them for 
sale.

<HEADLINE>  Map Shows Mars Is Pear-Shaped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new laser-produced map of the red planet  
shows that Mars is a land of extremes, with the highest, lowest and 
smoothest land forms found in the solar system. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-dimensional map of Mars, drawn from measurements taken  
by the Mars Global Surveyor program, also shows the planet to be 
pear-shaped, with towering volcanic mountains in the south, and a 
smooth lowland in the north. 
</P>
<P>
	There's about 19 to 20 miles difference between the highest and  
the lowest points on Mars, about 1 1/2 times the range of elevation 
seen on Earth, said David Smith, a NASA scientist and the lead 
author of a study appearing today in the journal Science. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said that an asteroid or other space rock smashed into  
Mars billions of years ago and blasted out a crater deeper than 
Mount Everest is high. 
</P>
<P>
	On the other extreme is a volcanic mountain, called Olympus  
Mons, that soars almost 17 miles above the average elevation of 
Mars, making it the highest volcano in the solar system. 
</P>
<P>
	In the northern hemisphere, there is a huge basin that dips down  
to about six miles below the average elevation of Mars. 
</P>
<P>
	Maria Zuber, a professor at Massachusetts Institute of  
Technology and a co-author of the mapping project, said the basin 
``is consistent with the formation of a past ocean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whether or not Mars ever had enough water to fill such a basin  
is still unconfirmed, she said, although the area is smooth and 
featureless, as if sea lapped for an eternity. 
</P>
<P>
	Zuber said Mars probably has quite a bit of water, trapped  
beneath the north and south poles as ice. She estimated that the 
combined deposits of water at the two poles would equal about 1.5 
times the water frozen in the glaciers and lakes of Greenland. 
</P>
<P>
	That quantity, said Zuber, would equal about 40 percent of the  
amount of liquid water estimated to have once flowed on Mars. She 
said much of this water was probably ``lost to space'' over the 4 
billion-year history of the planet. 
</P>
<P>
	Data for the Mars map was collected by an instrument called the  
Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter.

<HEADLINE> Indians' Ramirez Appeals Suspension </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Cleveland outfielder Manny Ramirez appealed his  
three-game suspension Friday, and took advantage right away with an 
RBI double in his first at-bat against Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez was suspended Thursday by AL president Gene Budig for  
charging the mound last Saturday after being hit in the helmet by a 
pitch from Detroit's Jeff Weaver. 
</P>
<P>
	The penalty was to start Friday. Because he appealed, Ramirez  
was allowed to play, and he doubled off the wall in right-center 
field for major league-leading 60th RBI. 
</P>
<P>
	Tigers reliever C.J. Nitkowski, who was suspended for two games  
for throwing a knockdown pitch in Saturday's same game, did not 
appeal. He started his penalty Friday when Detroit played Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Indians manager Mike Hargrove said he will attend a  
meeting between his pitcher Jaret Wright and Budig on Tuesday in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was asked if I wanted to be there and I said yes,'' Hargrove  
said. ``It wasn't required.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Budig announced the scheduled meeting when he fined Wright for  
his part in the brawl last Saturday at Jacobs Field. Wright hit the 
Tigers' Tony Clark in the helmet. 
</P>
<P>
	Budig said he wants to discuss Wright's ``deportment on the  
mound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wright faced the Red Sox on Friday night for the first time  
since he hit Darren Lewis with a high pitch that precipitated a 
brawl April 29 in Fenway Park. Wright got a five-game suspension 
then. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think Jaret is doing this on purpose,'' Hargrove said  
with emphasis. ``And he has not been ordered to do it. I don't 
Jaret is a headhunter and I don't think he is throwing at people. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an 0-2 pitch to Clark and he was trying to come in and  
that's what he should do. You get a scouting report and it says to 
throw hard stuff up and in and then breaking balls down and away. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now up and in doesn't mean up around somebody's nose. If you  
are a power pitcher and you are pitching up and the ball gets away 
from you, guess where it's going to go?'' he said. ``Jaret said it 
best when he said that if he had pinpoint control his ERA wouldn't 
be six.''

<HEADLINE> Refugees Use Net for News From Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT DIX, N.J. (AP) -- The weary Kosovo refugee sat quietly at a  
computer terminal for hours, searching the World Wide Web for 
images from the war-ravaged homeland he was forced to flee. 
</P>
<P>
	The grisly photographs he found overwhelmed Lulzim Dervishi. As  
images of mutilated, bullet-riddled bodies filled the screen before 
him, the 21-year-old put his head down, overcome with emotion. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need to look at it,'' said Abedin Bajupag, a fellow  
refugee working here as a computer instructor and interpreter in 
the Internet Information Center. ``Every day, they look for 
relatives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More and more ethnic Albanian refugees airlifted to sanctuary at  
Fort Dix are turning to cyberspace for news and information from 
Yugoslavia, getting updates from home in English and Albanian. They 
are also using the Web to search for lost relatives. 
</P>
<P>
	About 3,500 Kosovo refugees have been transported to this former  
Army basic training facility from camps in Macedonia for 
resettlement in communities around the country. The United States 
has agreed to accept up to 20,000 of the hundreds of thousands who 
have fled since NATO bombings began in Yugoslavia in March. 
</P>
<P>
	In an Internet center set up in an air-conditioned construction  
trailer at Fort Dix, more than two dozen refugees gathered 
Wednesday at a row of a dozen computers donated by Apple. 
</P>
<P>
	With a click of the mouse, they accessed Web sites that allowed  
them to read news accounts in their native language from familiar 
and trusted sources such as the weekly Albanian newspaper ``Voice 
of Kosova,'' or take in Albanian television reports and radio 
segments from Pristina, the capital of the Kosovo province, on 
Radio 21. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're only looking at stuff they can understand,'' said Dave  
Zweigel, who is supervising the center for the U.S. Information 
Agency. ``They would look at CNN if it were in Albanian.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many were drawn to the Internet site www.Alb-net.com, where they  
viewed graphic photo galleries of alleged war crimes by Serbian 
soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of them are rather horrific,'' said Chris Dingman, a  
center volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
	Selvie Berisha, 19, desperately wanted to see the images the  
site contends are evidence of the atrocities against women, 
children and the elderly, victims of ethnic cleansing. She fled her 
home in Pristina. 
</P>
<P>
	``She wants to see it. The computer helps her to know what is  
going on,'' an interpreter said for the young woman. ``She saw 
people without eyes. She's very sad. She thinks her relatives that 
are in Kosovo -- maybe they are dead. All night she thinks about 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The iMac computers were set up to allow the refugees easy  
Internet access with minimal supervision. Instructions are written 
on a blackboard in Albanian and key Web sites and links already are 
bookmarked. 
</P>
<P>
	The Internet Center, which opened last week, is staffed by  
volunteers, mainly from Macintosh user groups in New Jersey and 
Pennsylvania. It's open weekdays, but Zweigel said the hours will 
be expanded as demand increases. 
</P>
<P>
	Young refugee children sat at terminals side-by-side with their  
elders, patiently helping them navigate the Internet. Some sat with 
their heads bent listening closely to reports piped through 
computer speakers from the Voice of America, Radio Free Europe and 
the BBC. 
</P>
<P>
	``The world divided us, the net brought us together, therefore  
the future shall keep us together,'' says a heading for the Kosova 
Crisis Center Web page. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, only one refugee at Fort Dix has located a missing  
relative -- a cousin -- through the Internet, Zweigel said. But 
officials are hoping for more success stories and are helping 
refugees set up e-mail accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	The computers are not just a conduit to horror. Luan Ardiu, 13,  
who came to the United States with his parents and three older 
brothers, also uses them to play a video game. 
</P>
<P>
	Other refugees regularly look for the latest NBA scores, Zweigel  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``So when is (Michael) Jordan coming is what everyone wants to  
know,'' he said with a laugh. ``They really follow basketball.''

<HEADLINE> Huskies To Pay Frat House Damage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- University of Washington football players,  
accused of trashing a fraternity house, have agreed to pay for the 
damage, coach Rick Neuheisel said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel said he called a team meeting Friday to discuss the  
damage done to the Tau Kappa Epsilon house last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I called the team to meet and gave them the idea that a  
meeting was necessary,'' Neuheisel said. ``I was there at the 
beginning and then stepped aside. The football team is going to 
collect the money from amongst themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Discussing the matter publicly for the first time, Neuheisel  
acknowledged that some players took part in the disturbance that 
caused an estimated $4,400 in damages to the TKE house, but said he 
had no idea how many players may have been actively involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were some football players there that had no part in the  
ransacking,'' he said. ``I'm unclear as to what level of 
participation we had. I just know that when people say `football 
players' they're talking about all of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A number of uninvited people were turned away from a private  
party at the TKE house Saturday, resulting in a fight in which two 
windows were reported broken. TKE members told police that early 
Sunday, 10 or more intruders, some of which they identified as 
football players, entered the house and broke windows and chairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Two TKE members said they were roughed up when they came  
downstairs to check on the disturbance. Names of any football 
players allegedly involved have not been made public. 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel has been conducting his own investigation into the  
disturbance, as have Seattle police. He said the repayment plan 
wasn't intended to curb the police investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're fully cooperating with the police as to any assaults  
that may have taken place,'' he said. ``At the time their 
investigation is completed, then I would take appropriate action.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neuheisel said if charges are filed and any player is convicted  
of a serious assault, ``that certainly would be grounds for 
dismissal'' from the team.

<HEADLINE> Horses Find New Home in South Dakota </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INTERIOR, S.D. (AP) -- Thirty-five wild horses rounded up from a  
sprawling missile range in New Mexico arrived at their new home in 
South Dakota Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The herd was unloaded into a corral on a South Dakota ranch, the  
end of a long journey to save the horses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was beyond my wildest hopes,'' said Karen Sussman,  
president of the International Society for the Protection of 
Mustangs and Burros. ``They're quiet, they're all grazing. We can 
walk right next to them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The horses will remain in the corral for a week or two until  
they adjust, then they will be turned loose on half of the 
10,000-acre ranch, Ms. Sussman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Jeff Krolikowski, son-in-law of ranch owner Alan Amiotte, says  
the ranch, which lies on the Pine Ridge Sioux reservation, has 
knee-high green grass, rolling hills, towering pine trees and an 
abundance of fresh water. 
</P>
<P>
	The horses were trucked off the missile range in the New Mexico  
desert Thursday, ending the era of wild horses on the 
3,000-square-mile range. The herd, descended from horses left 
behind by ranchers when the military took over the area in World 
War II, once numbered 1,800. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever since 122 horses died of starvation and dehydration during  
a 1994 drought, the military and an animal protection group have 
worked to find the animals new homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Adoptions that began in 1995 whittled the population down to  
about 80 horses this spring. Last month, another group of 35 horses 
was taken to Amiotte's ranch. Those horses are roaming free in 
several small bands. 
</P>
<P>
	Up to 10 horses remain on the missile range. If any mares are  
found -- there are believed to be three or so -- they too will be 
sent to South Dakota. The stallions will live out their lives at 
White Sands.

<HEADLINE> 3 Charged in Baby-Smuggling Ring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Two women and a lawyer have been charged with  
running an illegal baby-smuggling operation that sold 17 Mexican 
children to adoptive families in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Arlene Lieberman, 48, and Arlene Reingold, 47, neighbors in  
Medford on Long Island, were charged Thursday in federal court with 
conspiracy to violate immigration laws, along with mail and wire 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Reyes, 40, was arrested Wednesday night at his home in  
Douglas, Ariz., which abuts a Mexican border town called Agua 
Prieta where he had a law practice. He faces the same charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors say the three sold babies for $20,000 or more  
without any of the required immigration and adoption paperwork. The 
adoptive parents were unwitting victims, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service said  
the children would be allowed to remain with their adoptive parents 
and that the government would work to legalize their status, The 
New York Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	But some parents still remain fearful about the children's  
future. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our biggest concern is that we don't want anyone to take our  
child away from us,'' Sara Kruchkow said of the 3-year-old girl she 
and her husband adopted. 
</P>
<P>
	The court papers allege that Reyes paid to have babies smuggled  
from his Agua Prieta office across the border to his Arizona home, 
sometimes by Mexican women posing as the children's mothers. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant U.S. Attorney Timothy Macht said he could not comment  
on how the children were obtained. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the children were babies as young as two weeks old;  
others had serious medical problems despite assurances given to 
adoptive parents that the children were healthy, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	One couple was presented with a 7-year-old girl who was mentally  
retarded, malnourished and also showed signs of sexual abuse. The 
couple, in their 50s, returned her to Mrs. Lieberman and never got 
a refund on their $20,000, court papers said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very happy they've been arrested,'' said Rosalie Liberto,  
a Long Island woman who adopted a little girl through the 
defendants two years ago and is still fighting to resolve the 
child's immigration status. ``We put our trust in people and they 
took advantage of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The two women, referred to in court documents as ``The  
Arlenes,'' first came to the attention of authorities in 1990, when 
the state Department of Social Services received complaints that 
they were misleading adoptive couples and arranging adoptions 
without a license. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Lieberman's phone number is unlisted. A man who answered  
the phone at Mrs. Reingold's home had no comment. Calls placed to 
lawyers representing the women were not returned. 
</P>
<P>
	Each woman was released on $150,000 bond. They have not yet  
entered pleas to the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, the defendants face up to 10 years in prison for  
each child illegally smuggled into the country. The wire and mail 
fraud charge carries a sentence of up to 5 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The state attorney general's office also filed suit Thursday  
against the two women and their husbands, Jay Lieberman and Dennis 
Reingold, seeking an order preventing them from participating in 
adoption placements.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Hurts Clinton's Poll Ratings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Neither Monica Lewinsky nor impeachment put a  
dent in President Clinton's lofty poll ratings. It took a war. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's approval ratings are dropping as Americans grow  
increasingly anxious about nine weeks of airstrikes, bombing 
accidents and debates over a ground invasion. 
</P>
<P>
	The president is still in relatively good shape with more than  
half the country -- 53 percent in the latest survey-- approving of 
how he handles his job. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fifty-three percent midway through your seventh year is pretty  
darn good,'' said Brookings Institution analyst Stephen Hess, an 
adviser to the Carter, Ford, Nixon and Eisenhower administrations. 
``It's always, compared to what and compared to whom? He was on 
such an abnormal high, thanks to impeachment. Now he's about where 
presidents tend to be at this point. That's not bad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the polls reveal doubts among Americans -- and those concerns  
have been reflected on Capitol Hill, most notably when the House, 
on a tie vote of 213 to 213, refused to support airstrikes against 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of these polls are showing less basic support for  
involvement in Kosovo and less general support for President 
Clinton as a consequence,'' said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew 
Research Center. ``The public is frustrated by a lack of progress 
and also by these accidents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``President Clinton should be somewhat nervous and Al Gore  
should be very nervous,'' Kohut said. ``A decline in basic 
political support would not be a good thing for campaign 2000.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials said they are not alarmed by the declining  
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Historically, it's high,'' said presidential press secretary  
Joe Lockhart. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is some natural impatience with some who would like to  
see this over with,'' Lockhart said. He said the administration 
shares that feeling, ``but we have to show determination and 
patience until we have met our objectives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A series of recent news stories -- the Colorado shootings, China  
and Kosovo -- ``have dampened the national mood a little bit,'' 
Lockhart said. ``But we're working hard on all fronts and we're 
confident the president will continue to enjoy strong support from 
the American public.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton pollster Mark Penn takes regular surveys about the  
Kosovo conflict -- weekly, according to one senior administration 
official, less frequently, according to another. 
</P>
<P>
	A Pew poll conducted May 12-16 found that public approval for  
U.S. participation in the airstrikes had fallen to 53 percent from 
62 percent in mid-April. Clinton's foreign policy ratings slipped 
and his overall job approval was unchanged at 56 percent after 
slipping a few weeks earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, down from the halcyon days of impeachment,'' Kohut  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	A poll released Wednesday by CNN/USA Today/Gallup was similar to  
the Pew survey: Clinton's job approval declined to 53 percent, from 
60 percent earlier this month, support for U.S. involvement in 
Kosovo slipped to 49 percent and only 40 percent of Americans 
supported sending ground troops if airstrikes didn't work. Pew 
found 44 percent would support sending ground troops. 
</P>
<P>
	``My sense is that he can do anything except get Americans  
killed,'' said Hess. ``A ground war is out. As far as continuing 
his present policy, I think Americans are willing to go along with 
him, sometimes holding their nose, but to go along with him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kohut said Clinton would need ``not only a majority but a big  
majority'' of support before moving to a ground invasion. ``They're 
nowhere close to it. They've never had it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hess said public attention to the war is falling off as  
television news about Kosovo declines. ``At the beginning of April 
we were getting something like 215 minutes on the weekday news 
programs. Last week it was down to 55 minutes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said it was telling that Clinton felt comfortable taking a  
Florida vacation during the airstrikes. ``That's indicative of how 
this war isn't sticking to the ribs of the average American.''

<HEADLINE> Pacers' Miller Zips Trash Talk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- Reggie Miller knows what matters -- his  
shooting eye, not his mouth. So the trash talk is in short supply 
as his Indiana Pacers prepare for the Eastern Conference finals 
against arch-rival New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if I've held my tongue,'' Miller said. ``We know  
that they want us. We know that we want them. What more needs to be 
said? Both teams respect each other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Indiana Pacers and New York Knicks go at it again Sunday,  
the fifth time in seven years they have met in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pacers tuned up for the game with a public scrimmage Friday  
night attended by 12,316 fans who took advantage of the free 
admission to see their favorites. 
</P>
<P>
	Game 1 is at Market Square Arena, where the Pacers have won 12  
consecutive playoff games. The streak includes three victories in 
last year's conference semifinals when Indiana ousted the Knicks 
4-1. 
</P>
<P>
	Another enthusiastic crowd is expected for the game, which will  
begin shortly after the Indianapolis 500 is held nearby. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to be very important,'' Indiana guard Mark  
Jackson said of the fans. ``We're going to win, but it is going to 
be enjoyable to have them turn this place out like never before. 
What an awesome feeling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller has tormented the Knicks through the years. In one such  
performance in 1994 he scored 39 points. A year later, he scored 
eight points during the closing 16 seconds of an Indiana victory at 
Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
	He tuned up for this series by scoring 28 points on 9-of-16  
shooting as his Blue team, which included all five starters, lost 
to the Gold team 116-111. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our defense wasn't very good, but I expected that. One thing I  
was concerned about is the rust, and we had plenty of that,'' coach 
Larry Bird said, referring to the time off since the Pacers' 
second-round sweep of Philadelphia ended last Sunday. ``I think it 
was a good experience. We had a lot of fans here, a lot of 
support.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana won the season series with New York 2-1.  
</P>
<P>
	``In the three games we played them, Reggie Miller wasn't really  
a factor,'' Knicks forward Marcus Camby said. ``It was other guys 
around him who played extremely well.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miller is second to San Antonio's Tim Duncan in scoring among  
those still in the playoffs. He's averaged 23.7 points as Indiana 
swept Milwaukee and Philadelphia to move into the conference 
finals. The Pacers are the only unbeaten team in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Knicks guard Allan Houston points to Miller's ability to get to  
the foul line, where he led the league with a 91.5 percentage this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's very good at (drawing contact),'' Houston said. ``Since  
he has a reputation for that, he gets calls for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Houston said some of the calls are made by officials fooled by  
Miller's flopping to the court without contact. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you can get away with it, why not?'' Houston said.  
</P>
<P>
	Told about the remarks, Miller smiled.  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm older than those two guys. I'm supposed to get the  
calls,'' he said. ``All I know is we beat them two out of three 
times. And if I remember right, Camby didn't play in two of those 
games, so how is he going to talk?'' 
</P>
<P>
	They Pacers had four days of practice since Sunday, and Bird  
decided to break the routine with a public scrimmage Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a little different. You have to adjust,'' Bird said.  
``Through the season we were complaining about playing nearly every 
night and now we're complaining about sitting around. 
</P>
<P>
	``At least we've got some time to work on some things and  
hopefully keep our concentration for Sunday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bird thought the scrimmage would give his players an opportunity  
to perform before fans again. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always good to get the fans in here, get the players  
riled up. You can always take your game to the next level when fans 
are in here yelling and screaming,'' Bird said. ``We're doing it so 
Sunday when we come out we won't have a lot of rust on us. I think 
that will help us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bird recalled that when he played for the Boston Celtics he  
sometimes had big breaks during the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's really hard to gear back up for the game,'' he said. ``In  
practice, you have good intensity for the first 45 minutes, and 
then it starts going downhill. It's hard to keep it up over a long 
period of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The turnout and the enthusiasm of the fans delighted Miller.  
</P>
<P>
	``It really shows what this city is all about, really backing  
us,'' he said. ``It's very inspirational.''

<HEADLINE> Military Buys 9,000 Purple Hearts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOMBALL, Texas (AP) -- The Defense Department is buying 9,000  
Purple Hearts, the Pentagon's first order in eight years for the 
medals that are awarded to soldiers hurt during hostilities. 
</P>
<P>
	The order was made to replenish a diminishing supply rather than  
in anticipation that more would be needed because of the NATO 
attacks on Yugoslavia, said Frank Johnson, a spokesman for the 
Defense Logistics Agency in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``It should not be associated with that,'' Johnson said Friday.  
</P>
<P>
	He said orders to his office by U.S. military installations  
around the world have diminished his supply. 
</P>
<P>
	The 37,000 Purple Hearts in stock were refurbished in 1991 and  
``since then we've been eating inventory,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said 7,000 were distributed to bases last year.  
</P>
<P>
	Graco Industries in the Houston suburb of Tomball is making the  
medals, which cost the government $6 apiece.

<HEADLINE> Asian Scientists Fear Backlash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Joel Wong is a Chinese-American scientist  
working at the Lawrence Livermore nuclear weapons lab. Lately, he's 
been feeling the chill wind of guilt by association. 
</P>
<P>
	With allegations that China has pursued an espionage campaign  
for U.S. nuclear secrets, he said there is a perception that ``An 
Asian is an Asian, no matter of whether they are an American 
citizen. They think we have our loyalty to the mother country, but 
they don't understand we're American just like everybody else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His worries come after allegations that Taiwanese-born scientist  
Wen Ho Lee downloaded hundreds of classified files at the Los 
Alamos National Laboratory. Lee, who has not been charged with a 
crime, was fired in March. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, a congressional report concluded that China stole  
U.S. nuclear secrets over 20 years of concerted spying. China has 
denied it. 
</P>
<P>
	The backlash against Chinese-American scientists can be seen  
from bad jokes at work to comments by senators, said Wong, an 
industrial hygienist who was born in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Raymond Ng, an Oakland native who works as a mechanical  
engineer at the California branch of the Sandia National 
Laboratory, recently took their concerns to Energy Secretary Bill 
Richardson. 
</P>
<P>
	At the labs, employees laughed when a man of Asian descent was  
introduced to lead a session on security, they said. An Asian woman 
at Los Alamos was told she could not transfer with her supervisor 
because of her ``characteristics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At Livermore, about 45 miles southwest of San Francisco, someone  
suggested deleting a photograph of an Asian from the lab's Web 
page, ``because people might suspect that we are spies,'' Wong 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	And the suspicion is not only in the labs.  
</P>
<P>
	An editorial cartoon by Pat Oliphant, for instance, showed a  
horde of tiny figures, many with the buck teeth and thick glasses 
of the most virulent anti-Asian portrayals, scurrying over a 
sleeping security dog at Los Alamos. In the corner a blurb read, 
``The Chinese eat dogs y'know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Oliphant was out of the country Friday, but Universal Press  
Syndicate Managing Editor Sue Roush defended his artistic license. 
``It's not an ethnic slur, it's a cartoon about Chinese 
espionage,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	When Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., talked about the spy scandal  
he made reference to ``a crafty people.'' A newsmagazine called to 
ask Livermore lab officials for a ``generic'' photograph of an 
Asian employee at work to illustrate a spy story. Lab spokesman 
Jeff Garberson declined the request. 
</P>
<P>
	Asians don't act as a homogenous lump, Wong said. And he and his  
colleagues ``don't condone spying on any level against the U.S. 
government,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	This week, Rep. David Wu, D-Ore., the House's first  
Chinese-American, sponsored a resolution saying it was wrong for 
Congress and Americans to stereotype people. 
</P>
<P>
	The resolution was backed by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif.,  
whose special panel's report alleged Chinese theft of U.S. nuclear 
weapons secrets. 
</P>
<P>
	Managers at the national labs have responded positively to Asian  
concerns, Wong and Ng said. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking up was difficult, Wong said, because ``our cultural  
roots say, 'Well, you just do your work and keep quiet.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Sandia head C. Paul Robinson pointed out in a newsletter that  
white Americans such as himself weren't held responsible for the 
case of Aldrich Ames, the CIA agent who sold secrets to the 
Russians. ``Can we all please think extra hard about that?'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Botanical Art Creates DC Jungle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Determined to paint the elusive night-blooming  
cactus in bloom, artist Margaret Mee made 15 trips up the Amazon 
River before finally achieving her goal in 1988 -- the year she 
died. 
</P>
<P>
	The product of her determination went on display Friday in an  
exhibit of her 30 years of jungle artwork at the Smithsonian 
Institution's National Museum of Natural History. 
</P>
<P>
	The night-bloomer, selenicereus witii, doesn't bloom every year.  
And when it finally chooses to bloom, it does so for only one 
night. Mee kept an all night vigil to finally get a glimpse. 
</P>
<P>
	The British-born naturalist's three decades in Brazil weren't  
all spent waiting for one flower, though. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, one of her paintings inspired John Kress, chairman of  
the museum's botany department, to travel to Brazil and search out 
the flower itself. 
</P>
<P>
	He later named it Heliconia var. Meeana in honor or her  
pioneering work, and her painting of it concludes the exhibit, 
which will remain at the museum until Aug. 20. 
</P>
<P>
	``These extraordinary paintings have a special power to convey  
the beauty of Amazonia and enable us to understand why this 
outstanding lady inspired so many scientists, conservationists and 
artists to take up the cause of protecting our fragile planet and 
its life-supporting fauna,'' said exhibit curator Ruth L. A. Stiff 
of England's Royal Botanic Gardens at Kew. 
</P>
<P>
	Mee studied and painted plants in their native surroundings,  
discovering several new species in the process. 
</P>
<P>
	``Margaret Mee: Return to the Amazon,'' opens with a videotape  
of an interview she did and, besides her art, includes descriptions 
of her life and adventures, among them falling from a boat during a 
flood and being fished from the murky water still gripping a metal 
cup and her toothbrush. 
</P>
<P>
	Mee painted with gouache, a system using opaque colors that  
produces the subtle glows of watercolors but with brighter, 
stronger shades to display the boldness and softness or her 
tropical plants. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-two paintings line a long hallway off the museum's second  
floor. Visitors see the bright reds and oranges of Neoregelia 
eleutheropetala. Nearby are the painted pinks and purples of 
Cattleya violacea. There is a lacy lavender of Heterostemom 
mimosoides and the spidery whites and grays of Philodendron 
arcuatum. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides paintings from the Smithsonian Institution, including  
one borrowed from the office of museum director Robert Fri, 
paintings are on loan from Kew Gardens, the Margaret Mee Amazon 
Trust, Fundacao Botanica de Sao Paulo in Brazil and private 
collections. The show opened in Houston, Texas and visited other 
cities before coming to Washington.

<HEADLINE>  Penguins' Buyout Proposal On Hold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- A proposal to buy the Pittsburgh Penguins was  
put on hold Friday while attorneys argue over whether the team's 
arena lease should be dissolved. 
</P>
<P>
	A bankruptcy judge Friday refused to grant preliminary approval  
to a buyout plan by Civic Arena landlord SMG Inc. and broadcaster 
Fox Sports Net Pittsburgh until the lease question is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a good day. Today the Titanic hit an iceberg,'' said  
attorney Doug Campbell, referring to SMG. 
</P>
<P>
	Campbell's client, retired Penguins center Mario Lemieux, has  
presented a competing plan to keep the team in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Friday, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Bernard Markovitz indicated  
he would allow the Penguins to set up an escrow account to protect 
season-ticket buyers if the team leaves town. He also said the 
National Hockey League does not have to reveal the name of a 
mystery buyer willing to pay $85 million to move the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Markovitz suggested SMG stands a chance of losing the lease,  
which was scheduled to continue through 2012. He added that the 
SMG-Fox buyout won't be approved until the lease issue is decided. 
He scheduled another hearing for next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	If the SMG-Fox proposal fails, only Lemieux's buyout plan would  
remain to keep the team in Pittsburgh. An NHL plan would dissolve 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux, the team's former star center, said he would continue  
negotiating to try to find a plan to make everybody happy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every day is very important from now on,'' he said outside  
court. ``I want to make deals with people to get this thing going 
within the next couple of weeks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He pointed to a noontime downtown rally Friday to ``Save the  
Pens'' in which fans presented an Internet petition bearing 63,000 
names asking city officials to keep the team in town. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody gets the feeling they're running out of  
time,'' Lemieux said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lemieux said he was happy that the judge gave credence to the  
team's request to end the SMG lease. 
</P>
<P>
	Penguins' lawyers contended the lease is actually a loan that is  
mostly paid off. 
</P>
<P>
	When Howard Baldwin bought the team in 1991, SMG provided $24  
million toward the purchase price. As a result, the team pays an 
estimated $6 million to $7 million per year to SMG, payments 
Penguins officials say helped drive the team into bankruptcy and 
are preventing a financial recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	SMG President Wes Westley has said player salaries and cash  
withdrawals by team owners were more significant causes of the 
Penguins' financial woes. 
</P>
<P>
	Penguins attorney Robert Sable calculated that the unpaid lease  
balance is under $3 million, assuming a 9 percent interest rate on 
the loan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Penguins' request to throw out the lease ``appears to have  
enough substance for further review,'' Markovitz said.
