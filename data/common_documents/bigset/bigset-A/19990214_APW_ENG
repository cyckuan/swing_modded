<HEADLINE> Player: Okla. St. Not Tough Enough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STILLWATER, Okla. (AP) -- Oklahoma State point guard Doug  
Gottlieb thinks he knows why the Cowboys, preseason picks to win 
the Big 12, are in the middle of the pack with just four games 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	It doesn't have anything to do with talent or coaching, Gottlieb  
said after Sunday's 73-68 loss to Texas. Instead, he said, it has 
to do with a lack of toughness. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not warriors like we were last year,'' Gottlieb said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Those guys really battled,'' he said of Texas. ``Every time  
they took a shot, whether it was a good shot or a bad shot, they 
went and wanted the ball. If that ball was tipped in the air, they 
went and grabbed it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And the Cowboys, he said, didn't. Chris Mihm had 21 points and  
15 rebounds in just 23 minutes, and Gabe Muoneke had 22 points and 
nine boards. The Longhorns outrebounded Oklahoma State 41-27 and 
had 18 offensive rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a guy's stronger than you, he's stronger than you,''  
Gottlieb said. ``Mihm's bigger than anybody we've got. But you have 
to come out and play. If you have to beat the guy up by boxing him 
out, by playing harder and then have to ask out because you're 
tired, that's fine. We don't seem to have that in our team 
chemistry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gottlieb noted that a year ago, the Cowboys took a lead against  
Texas and went on to win handily. They took an early lead Sunday as 
well, but Texas answered with a quick run to gain control and 
didn't trail the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``They beat us up today at our own gym, which should be  
embarrassing to everybody on the team,'' Gottlieb said. ``I know 
personally I'm embarrassed that this game was on ABC, and it was 
the first time we've ever had a TV game that wasn't full. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's saying something to me. That's saying the fans are  
tired of you guys, and I don't blame 'em. I can't blame the fans 
for being upset at us because I'm upset at us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gottlieb praised the play of senior guard Adrian Peterson, who  
had 24 points and seven rebounds. He said Peterson has played hard 
all season. It's the rest of the group, himself included, who have 
been a disappointment, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not anything coaching, it's not anything with Pete, it's  
just the rest of us,'' Gottlieb said. ``We've got to come out and 
start to play. And if we do, there's no reason we can't win the 
last four games. There's no reason we can't win the Big 12 
tournament.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Peterson, seated alongside Gottlieb during the postgame  
interview, didn't argue the points Gottlieb made. 
</P>
<P>
	``I agree with everything he's saying. There's nothing else you  
can say,'' Peterson said. 
</P>
<P>
	Even coach Eddie Sutton, who didn't hear the remarks first-hand,  
agreed with the general theme. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that's one of the things that really bothers me, that  
we're not as tough as maybe a lot of my teams have been,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Rep. Kasich To Run for President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Budget hawk Rep. John Kasich, saying he was  
``a little fresher'' than other politicians, is joining the growing 
list of Republicans who have formally announced plans to seek the 
GOP presidential nomination next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ohio Republican said he would formally announce Monday in  
his home state that he is filing papers with the Federal Election 
Commission to set up an exploratory committee and would then travel 
to New Hampshire and Iowa to begin his uphill battle for the 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	The 46-year-old House Budget Committee chairman joins four other  
Republicans who have formed exploratory committees -- Sen. John 
McCain of Arizona, former Vice President Dan Quayle, conservative 
activist Gary Bauer and former Secretary of Education Lamar 
Alexander. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other Republicans now considered front-runners for the GOP  
nomination, Texas Gov. George W. Bush and former Red Cross 
President Elizabeth Dole, have yet to announce their intentions. 
Millionaire publisher Steve Forbes also is expected to make another 
run for the White House, and a second run by former California Gov. 
Pete Wilson is possible. 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich, now in his ninth term in the House, has built a  
reputation as a tenacious supporter of smaller government and lower 
taxes. In the interests of balancing the budget, he has at times 
differed with his party's leadership, such as in opposing the 
building of B-2 bombers and his advocacy of closing big business' 
tax loopholes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a different kind of politician, particularly in my  
party,'' Kasich said on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' ``and I'm going 
to try to build a better America, try to inspire some people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich characterized himself as a mailman's son who grew up in a  
blue-collar community near Pittsburgh and ``got into politics 
because I wanted to change the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said that since 1952, the year he was born, there has been a  
Nixon, Bush or Dole on every GOP ticket except in 1964, and it was 
time for a change in the Republican party. ``They're like Pepsi and 
Coke,'' he said. ``Everybody knows their names.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kasich said he wasn't concerned about the low level of his name  
recognition. ``The beauty of this system is that you can go to Iowa 
and New Hampshire, and that's where people smell you, they poke 
you, they look you in the eye,'' he said. He added that Democrats 
Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton both used the Iowa-New Hampshire 
phenomenon to get their successful bids for the presidency on 
track. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he can succeed because ``I like to have fun, I have a  
lot of good ideas, I have a proven track record. And you know what 
it comes down to? I'm just a little different and a little fresher 
than a lot of the people that are in politics today.''

<HEADLINE> UCLA Has Lost Weekend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- UCLA headed to northern California ranked  
ninth in the country and in position to vie for the Pac-10 title. 
The Bruins headed home with two more losses and doubts about their 
attitude. 
</P>
<P>
	An 85-67 loss Saturday at California, the Bruins' biggest margin  
of defeat on the road to the Bears in 51 years, completed a lost 
weekend that began with a 77-73 loss to No. 6 Stanford on Thursday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	Baron Davis, who had 27 points for the Bruins but got little  
support from his teammates, said UCLA still seemed to have a 
hangover from Thursday night's loss when it got clobbered by 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you lose you move on. If you can't figure it out, you  
shouldn't be playing basketball,'' Davis said. ``We just laid down. 
If we're going to lose, we should go down fighting. I refuse to let 
somebody else treat us like they did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA committed 21 turnovers and made just four steals as opposed  
to nine by the Bears. The Bruins came into the game leading the 
Pac-10 conference with an average of 11 steals per game. 
</P>
<P>
	``When we got beat by Kentucky and Stanford, at least we played  
hard,'' Sean Farnham said. ``A lot of us have got to start working 
harder. We didn't expect this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the win, Cal kept alive its hopes of reaching the NCAA  
tournament. The Bears are just 14-8 overall and 5-7 in the 
conference, but have wins over UCLA and North Carolina when they 
were in the Top 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``We told the team coming in that Cal's probably the most  
dangerous 13-8 team in the country. It didn't take a genius to 
figure that out after they beat Rhode Island and North Carolina and 
had a two-point loss to Stanford,'' UCLA coach Steve Lavin said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're probably the mystery team in the conference as to why  
they're not 8-3 or 9-2. They're more talented than Stanford, not 
more experienced but more talented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Carl Boyd, who had 14 points and a career-high 15 rebounds for  
Cal, said the Bears know they can't afford to lose many more games 
if they want to earn a postseason berth. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think we really like being in this position, but this  
is the way it is,'' he said. ``Just suck it up and play hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cal coach Ben Braun said he hopes the win over UCLA will build  
the Bears' confidence. But he also felt that way after the win in 
late December over North Carolina, and that was followed by losses 
in three of the next four games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every game now is an important game. It's putting us a step  
closer to our goals,'' Braun said. ``We want to be a team that's 
playing better basketball at the end of the year -- that's what the 
NCAA committee looks at.''

<HEADLINE> Indians' Sexson Feels Betrayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Richie Sexson, who figured his playing time  
would increase this season, is disappointed by Cleveland's decision 
to sign veteran Wil Cordero. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to come off as a negative person toward Wil or  
anybody, but I feel very strongly about this,'' Sexson said. ``I 
felt I made the best of my opportunity last year. It turns out it 
didn't mean anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sexson, 24, took over at first base on Aug. 7 when Jim Thome  
broke his right hand and hit .321 (51-for-159) with 13 doubles, 11 
homers and 33 RBIs in 41 games. But he finished the season 1-for-17 
when Thome returned and was 0-for-8 in the postseason. 
</P>
<P>
	Cordero, 27, spent last season with the Chicago White Sox, where  
he hit .267 (91-for-341) with 13 HRs and 49 RBIs in 96 games. He 
appeared in 83 games at first base, eight games in right field and 
four games in left. 
</P>
<P>
	He signed with the Indians on Feb. 3 and will compete with  
Sexson for the lone opening in the Indians every day lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	``They got Cordero for a reason,'' Sexson said. ``I think he's  
on the team regardless. It's up to me to win the job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once a haven for young unproven players because of the team's  
lack of talent, the Indians now have an All-Star starting at each 
position and are coming off a fourth straight AL Central title. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager John Hart and manager Mike Hargrove think  
veteran players are essential to championship clubs. But Hart said 
the signing of Cordero, one of baseball's top-rated prospects 
before his 1997 arrest for spousal abuse, doesn't mean the Indians 
have given up on Sexson. 
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't do me any good to get into a he-said, she-said  
thing with Richie Sexson,'' Hart said. ``But I will say competition 
is a very good thing. It's up to Richie to get the job done. Go get 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sexson also plays left, which is occupied by David Justice. Mark  
Whiten, has one of the strongest arms in the game. 
</P>
<P>
	Sexson could compete with Cordero to be the regular designated  
hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	``From a business standpoint, a trade definitely makes sense to  
me,'' Sexson said. ``There comes a time when I can't go back to 
Class AAA to hit my hundredth home run. I've got to make my strides 
and become a major-league player.

<HEADLINE>  Eritrea Downs Ethiopian Aircraft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASMARA, Eritrea (AP) -- Shattering a three-day lull in the Horn  
of Africa war, Eritrea shot down an Ethiopian helicopter gunship 
Sunday. Reports of the shooting brought joyful residents into the 
streets of Eritrea's capital to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
	Eritrean authorities said its antiaircraft batteries brought  
down the Ethiopian Mi-24 helicopter at Bure, 45 miles south of the 
Eritrean port of Assab. All of the helicopter's crew were killed, 
the Eritrean Foreign Ministry said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just 2 1/2 hours earlier, an Ethiopian Antonov-12 bombed a sparsely  
populated civilian area on the outskirts of Assab. Casualty reports 
were not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
	Assab was a key trade outlet for Ethiopian goods until May, when  
war between Ethiopia and Eritrea forced Ethiopian companies to 
reroute their trade to nearby Djibouti. The two Horn of Africa 
neighbors are fighting over disputed areas along their 620-mile 
border. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 1,000 people were killed in May's fighting, which  
subsided in June with a U.S.-brokered moratorium on airstrikes. 
Full-scale war again flared Feb. 6, with Ethiopia using planes and 
at least one helicopter at several fronts. 
</P>
<P>
	News of the downed helicopter was reported on Eritrean radio  
Sunday, triggering street celebrations in Asmara. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are a small people but we are very strong,'' said Medhane  
Zerabruk, 39, a reveler at Asmara airport singing war songs. The 
cheering residents were quickly dispersed by police, apparently 
nervous that large crowds in the capital could draw air attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethiopia confirmed the shootdown, saying it took place during  
heavy artillery exchanges that continued until late afternoon. It 
had no comment on casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethiopian government spokeswoman Selome Tadesse said two  
Eritrean tanks and a large water reservoir were destroyed in the 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``Since the area is without any water supply, the destruction of  
the water reservoir is quite significant,'' Selome said. 
</P>
<P>
	An Eritrean government statement on Sunday said 16 civilians  
have been killed and 20 wounded by Ethiopian aircraft since Feb. 6. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ethiopia is resorting to air bombardment in violation of the  
U.S.-brokered moratorium because it has received heavy pounding in 
ground fighting,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Eritrean government also ordered the evacuation of the  
front-line border town of Zalambessa, 60 miles south of the 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Zalambessa has been tense since June, with periodic shelling by  
Ethiopian forces. Residents said Saturday that the shelling had 
escalated in the past week, forcing them underground into bunkers.

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Coffee Mate jars are displayed for purely  
symbolic reasons. The customers are ordering dates along with their 
cappuccino. 
</P>
<P>
	Welcome to Drip, a coffee bar on Manhattan's Upper West Side  
that's part personal ad, part living room, part singles bar for the 
caffeine crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	Customers can fill out questionnaires in which people describe  
themselves and their ideal mates. They are placed in notebooks, and 
if you find one that appeals to you, Drip's staff sets up a date. 
It costs $10 to submit an ad, $5 to request a date. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's something about the aura of Drip,'' said Amy  
Schwartzman, who will be spending Valentine's Day on Martha's 
Vineyard with a man she met through Drip. 
</P>
<P>
	They are engaged to be married this summer.  
</P>
<P>
	``You go there and you see people hanging out and you think,  
'Oh, they're like me,''' she added. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Schwartzman's fiance, Peter Brightbill, found her by leafing  
through the 22,000 personal ads on file at Drip. ``She was a dancer 
and a lawyer; I'm a playwright and a lawyer,'' Brightbill said. 
``We just had a lot in common.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Forty-five dates were scheduled on a recent Sunday afternoon.  
</P>
<P>
	Christina Dizebba, 28, a graduate student, was waiting for one  
of them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a good way to meet new people,'' she said. ``And it feels  
safer and more comfortable than a personal ad from a newspaper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drip is the brainchild of Nancy Slotnick, 31, a Harvard grad who  
used to work as a headhunter in the computer industry. She opened 
Drip because ``I felt like there weren't enough interesting places 
to meet people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Drip has fostered dozens of serious romances since opening 2 1/2  
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Alas, Ms. Slotnick has been so busy running Drip the last few  
years, she hasn't had time to work on her own love life. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't met the right person yet,'' she said, ``but I'm  
hoping to.''

	Clinton To Discuss Drugs in Mexico  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House officials admit that Mexico still  
has a ``tremendous problem'' with drug trafficking but are praising 
its eradication efforts in advance of President Clinton's two-day 
trip there that begins Sunday. Mexico's war against drug 
traffickers, highlighted by a new $400 million, land-sea-and-air 
battle plan, tops the agenda for Clinton's meetings with Mexican 
President Ernesto Zedillo. In addition to drugs, their agenda 
includes trade, migration and the environment.

	Americans Support Senate Decision  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A poll released Saturday has found Americans  
agree with senators who voted to acquit President Clinton of 
impeachment charges. A CBS News poll conducted after the vote on 
Friday, indicated 64 percent of the public supported acquittal, 
while 34 percent thought Clinton should have been convicted on 
charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. The poll also found 
56 percent disapproved of the Senate's handling of the trial and 62 
percent said the country would have been better off if the Lewinsky 
investigation never had started.

	Judge Punishes American Pilots  
</P>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- An irate federal judge Saturday held  
American Airlines' pilots union and two top board members in 
contempt and promised sizable fines against them, saying the union 
did not do enough to encourage pilots to return to work after a 
court order. More than half a million travelers have been left at 
the gate by the nation's second-largest airline because of the 
large number of pilots calling in sick. Although a judge had 
ordered the pilots Wednesday to quit their job action stemming from 
a dispute with management, about 1,700 of the airline's 9,400 
pilots remained on the sick list Saturday.

	Clinton Commits Troops to Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As many as 4,000 American troops will go to  
Kosovo as part of a 28,000-strong NATO peacekeeping force if 
warring Serbs and ethnic Albanians reach a political settlement, 
President Clinton said Saturday. Clinton said that without a U.S. 
commitment, the warfare could bleed beyond Kosovo's borders -- into 
Albania, Macedonia, Greece, Turkey, and even re-ignite conflict in 
Bosnia. The president's commitment of U.S. personnel was timed to 
strengthen Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's hand as she flew 
to France to nudge stalled talks between the Serb government and 
ethnic Albanians seeking independence for Kosovo.

	Deal Reported for Lockerbie Suspects

	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Saudi Arabian diplomats told U.N.  
officials that Libya had agreed to a deal to bring two Libyan 
suspects to trial in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jet over 
Lockerbie, Scotland, a U.N. spokesman said Saturday. Saudi 
officials told U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan that the Libyans 
had accepted a U.S.-British offer, which would include the transfer 
of the suspects from Libya to the Netherlands. The suspects would 
be tried in the Netherlands by Scottish judges under Scottish law 
in the deal, Eckhard said. If convicted, they would be imprisoned 
in Scotland, he said.

junior worlds, was fourth.

	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Oscar De La Hoya passed what he called the  
toughest test of his career, getting up from a knockdown and twice 
knocking down Ike Quartey to retain the WBC welterweight 
championship on a split decision Saturday night. De La Hoya 
clinched the victory by storming out in the 12th round to knock 
down Quartey in just 12 seconds. The champion then pummeled Quartey 
for the next minute before tiring in front of a crowd of about 
12,000.

	SEATTLE (AP) -- Gary Payton had 28 points, 16 assists and nine  
rebounds as the Seattle SuperSonics improved their record to 5-0 
with a 105-92 victory over the Denver Nuggets Saturday night. 
Hersey Hawkins added 20 points for the Sonics, who are off to their

<HEADLINE> Chefs Criticize 'Americanized' Food </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- When Italian chef Francesco Tonelli makes  
pizza, he never tops it with pepperoni. In fact, there's no 
pepperoni in his country -- or even spaghetti with meatballs, veal 
parmigiana or pasta as a main course. 
</P>
<P>
	French chef Michel Richard calls French dressing ``an outrage.''  
``You never see a French person serving tomato vinaigrette in his 
home,'' sniffs the master chef. 
</P>
<P>
	Egg foo yung, chicken chow mein, crispy noodles. Forget it. You  
won't find them listed on a menu in China, says Chinese chef 
Shirley Cheng. And that must-end-a-Chinese-meal-with, the fortune 
cookie, is actually an American invention. 
</P>
<P>
	So when Americans eat in a French restaurant, or a Chinese  
restaurant, or an Italian restaurant, or any other ethnic 
restaurant, they're more likely than not to eat food that no one in 
France, China or Italy is likely to eat -- or sometimes even to 
recognize. 
</P>
<P>
	Why? Why is it difficult to find French vinaigrette that's light  
and translucent, tabbouleh that's crunchy and green, sweet and sour 
pork that's naturally red and pasta sauce with the actual taste of 
tomatoes? 
</P>
<P>
	Wrong cooking methods, say the experts, a lack of proper  
ingredients, a shortage of professionally trained ethnic chefs, 
scarcity of the right tools and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, a dish may change character or even get crossed off  
a menu simply because Americans won't eat it. 
</P>
<P>
	Take ``aji,'' for instance, a Japanese dish in which the fish is  
essentially alive as you eat it. ``Every time you take it the fish 
kind of makes a face at you,'' said American chef Jonathan 
Zearfoss, who tried it in Japan. ``There's no way that you would be 
able to market that in America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although qualified chefs and proper ingredients are generally  
more available in recent years, many chefs still Americanize their 
ethnic dishes merely to please American palates. The result, 
critics say, is food that's heavy, creamy, thick and sweet with 
clashing flavors. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard, who moved to this country from France 24 years ago, is  
appalled at the way Americans smother their salads with thick, 
creamy, sweet dressings, like French dressing. 
</P>
<P>
	``They should stop that,'' said Richard, part owner of several  
restaurants in Washington and Los Angeles. ``The dressing should be 
lighter than the salad. It should complement it, not mask its 
flavor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His ideal dressing? A nice olive oil, a few drops of vinegar,  
salt and pepper. That's it. 
</P>
<P>
	Another American oddity that puzzles Richard, who calls his  
restaurants ``food embassies,'' is kids' menus rich with pasta and 
hamburgers. ``How come kids don't eat like adults?'' Richard 
wonders. 
</P>
<P>
	The pet peeve of Cheng is that the flavor of Chinese cuisine is  
all too often destroyed by stir-frying, deep-frying and blanketing 
food with too much sauce. 
</P>
<P>
	``Good food takes a long time cooking,'' said Cheng, who like  
Zearfoss and Tonelli is a professor at the Culinary Institute of 
America in Hyde Park, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	In China, she said, ``You prepare, you stew, you steam. ... But  
here it's stir-fry, deep-fry, because it's fast, the customer has 
no patience and the kitchen labor is limited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tonelli finds food preparation too complicated in the United  
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Italy enjoys many variations of tomato sauce, none has  
more than five ingredients, said Tonelli. Here, though, sauces tend 
to have more ingredients and the recipes more complexity. The same 
is true for American pizza, which not only has too many toppings 
but also includes ingredients you'd never find on an Italian pizza: 
bell pepper, pepperoni, chicken. 
</P>
<P>
	Another difference that Tonelli noted is the perception of food  
itself. Italian cooks prepare food ``more with our feelings, with 
our hearts, with smelling the food,'' Tonelli said. Americans try 
to analyze it and rationalize the techniques they use. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you can see both methods and understand them both, then try  
to balance them in the way you cook, you can probably improve and 
become a better cook,'' Tonelli said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tonelli and the others stressed that Americanizing dishes can  
produce great results. All said the customer should be told when a 
dish is not authentic. 
</P>
<P>
	``Otherwise, this creates confusion ... and makes people believe  
wrong things and have misconceptions,'' Tonelli said. 
</P>
<P>
	Zearfoss said American customers are becoming more educated  
about what they eat and as a result are beginning to demand more 
authentic ethnic fare. 
</P>
<P>
	Elizabeth Connell agrees.  
</P>
<P>
	A researcher who lived in Beijing for a year, Connell, 28, said  
when she ate in China, she would ``sit there and try to identify 
the spices'' in the food. ``But when I eat Chinese food in the 
United States,'' she said, ``I don't even taste those spices.''

<HEADLINE> 4th Ford Employee Dies After Blast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- A fourth Ford employee injured in a power plant  
explosion at the company's sprawling Rouge complex in Dearborn died 
Sunday at the hospital where he had been in intensive care since 
the blast. 
</P>
<P>
	Ken Anderson, 44, of Wyandotte, died at 9:45 a.m., said hospital  
spokeswoman Mattie Majors. 
</P>
<P>
	A state investigator says a natural gas buildup led to the Feb.  
1 explosion at the complex, where 10,000 people make cars, car 
parts and steel. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Warren Blow, 51, of Dearborn Heights died at the  
University of Michigan Hospital in Ann Arbor from burns sustained 
in the blast. 
</P>
<P>
	Welder Cody Boatwright, 51, died at the same hospital on Feb. 5.  
Pipe fitter Donald Harper, 58, died on the day of the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
	Plants at the complex make Ford Mustangs as well as engines and  
a variety of other vehicle components used at 16 of Ford's 20 North 
American assembly plants. Production at the plant resumed early 
this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Rouge Steel Co., which employs 3,100 workers at the 1,100-acre  
site, resumed limited production on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Risky Move Leads to Gordon's Win </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Jeff Gordon knows risky moves on the  
racetrack can lead to victory or calamity. 
</P>
<P>
	Racing three abreast on the high-banked turns at Daytona  
International Speedway is never recommended. Going four wide is out 
of the question, even though Gordon was almost forced to do that. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes you've got to do what you've got to do,'' he said  
Sunday after winning his gamble and second Daytona 500. 
</P>
<P>
	At virtually the same spot where he shot by Bill Elliott to win  
in 1997, Gordon got past Rusty Wallace with 10 laps remaining 
Sunday in The Great American Race. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a $2 million move that easily could have been a pile of  
twisted sheet metal. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon went low as Mike Skinner drove high entering the first  
turn. That left Wallace, who had dominated the race, caught in the 
middle. 
</P>
<P>
	One mistake by any other them, and all could have wrecked.  
Still, no one gave up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just couldn't block him off enough,'' Wallace said. ``I'm  
just so heartbroken that this happened.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, when Gordon won the race for the first time, he  
and teammate Terry Labonte did practically the same thing to 
Elliott. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, however, getting by the lapped car of Ricky Rudd was  
a problem Gordon had to solve before making the pass. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `Oh, Ricky, I hope you see me coming, because I'm  
coming real fast,' '' Gordon said. ``I didn't want to go in there, 
but I had so much momentum.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So, Gordon bet on his own ability and Rudd's experience. It  
worked and four abreast was barely avoided. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a lot of apron down there, and I utilized every bit of  
it,'' said Gordon, who missed crashing into Rudd by a matter of 
inches. 
</P>
<P>
	After driving on the apron -- which he did frequently when he  
needed to gain a position -- Gordon rode three abreast, eventually 
getting by Wallace. He then kept Skinner on the high side of the 
track and beat him in a drag race down the backstretch. 
</P>
<P>
	From there, Gordon's best friend was his own discipline. He  
never left the white line at the bottom of the turns, ensuring that 
any pass would have to come on the high side, the longer way around 
the 2 1/2-mile tri-oval. 
</P>
<P>
	With all the rest of the contenders out the mix, only defending  
champion Dale Earnhardt remained. He started working Gordon high 
and low beginning with the 192nd of 200 laps but was never able to 
catch him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was trying all I could to get to the 24,'' Earnhardt said of  
Gordon. ``His car was stronger from the center of the corner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon made sure of that. The Kid blocked Earnhardt the way The  
Intimidator has done so often while winning seven Winston Cup 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gordon, who began his run at a record-tying third straight  
series title, did much more than simply turn the wheel to thwart 
Earnhardt. 
</P>
<P>
	It was all about going slow to get there first. Gordon kept  
easing off the throttle, forcing Earnhardt break his momentum, then 
got on the accelerator again and pulled away slightly. 
</P>
<P>
	He permitted Earnhardt to close up to the point where he  
couldn't attempt a longer run that would give him the momentum 
necessary to pass. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the final lap, one that would decide whether the  
greatest driver in NASCAR history could duplicate the winning pass 
he made two days earlier to beat Mark Martin in an IROC all-star 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	With a record 33 victories on the track, Earnhardt knows more  
about winning passes than anyone else. But this time, it was not to 
be. 
</P>
<P>
	As the cars exited the fourth turn, Earnhardt made his move. He  
faked going to the outside, then tried the short route on the 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon went to the bottom, so far down that Earnhardt was almost  
forced to veer left onto pit road. He had to back off or he would 
have slid across the grass that separates pit road from the last 
200 yards of asphalt Gordon rode to the biggest payoff in auto 
racing history. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gordon wasn't the only one who collected, Earnhardt said as  
he reflected on the tense finish that had 185,000 fans on their 
feet over the frantic final laps. 
</P>
<P>
	``They got their money's worth today,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Kwan, Weiss Scan Their New Rivals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Michelle Kwan and Michael Weiss know it's  
only a matter of time before some upstart with an attitude is 
nipping at their skate blades, just itching to knock them off that 
medals podium. 
</P>
<P>
	Now they know the names of those future nightmares: Naomi Nari  
Nam and Trifun Zivanovic. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan put on yet another elegant and spectacular display -- is  
there any other kind for her? -- to easily win her third title 
Saturday at the U.S. Figure Skating Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was one of those performances where I just let it go,''  
said Kwan, 18, of Torrance, Calif. ``This year I got a little 
nervous heading into nationals -- I want to improve. I already know 
there are people out there to challenge me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weiss, free from five-time champion Todd Eldredge's shadow for  
the first time in two years, was nearly flawless to win his first 
crown. 
</P>
<P>
	``It felt good, it definitely does,'' he said, a slow smile  
crossing his face. ``It's an incredibly prestigious title to hold, 
and being close to it the last couple of years, it feels great to 
be the champion of the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the future was following close behind. For Kwan, it's the  
sprite-like Nari Nam, who at 13 displays the same beyond-her-years 
elegance and maturity that Kwan did a few years back. 
</P>
<P>
	Nari Nam is too young to go to the world championships next  
month, so Kwan will be joined by Angela Nikodinov and Sarah Hughes, 
who finished fourth. Though Hughes is also only 13, she's eligible 
because she won the silver medal at the world juniors. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's an enormous gap,'' coach John Nicks said of the  
difference between Kwan and Nari Nam. ``To start, there's a 
five-year gap. Secondly, Michelle is unassailable in the area of 
elegance and interpretive skating. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully in the next few years, Naomi will be able to  
challenge her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Zivanovic, 23, of Los Angeles, jumped from seventh in 1997 -- he  
withdrew last year -- to second with the performance of his career. 
His program to ``West Side Story'' brought the crowd to its feet, 
and he responded by blowing kisses and pumping his arms. When coach 
Gary Visconti put a baseball hat on his head, Zivanovic quickly 
took it off and triumphantly waved it in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	Timothy Goebel, the only American to land a quadruple jump in  
competition, was third. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I got off the ice, I didn't care what place I got, it  
felt so good to skate that way,'' Zivanovic said. ``It's a dream 
come true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A dream that's been a long and hard time coming, too.  
Zivanovic's first love was hockey, but his mother used to bribe him 
with toys to figure skate. He wasn't always the easiest child to 
coach, Visconti recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Zivanovic was somewhat of a terror from the time he was  
7 to about 11. When he couldn't hit his jumps, he'd kick the ice or 
the walls. And he threatened to quit more times than Visconti can 
remember. 
</P>
<P>
	``He thought it was too hard. 'This is too difficult, I'm  
quitting.' He must have said that 100 times,'' Visconti said, 
laughing. ``It's been 15 years of discipline and a little coaching 
on the side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Visconti's patience paid off, and it's meant more to  
Zivanovic and his family than any medal from nationals. Zivanovic's 
mother, Glenda, has multiple sclerosis and is confined to a 
wheelchair. Her husband, Zoran, is a mechanic for Mercedes. 
</P>
<P>
	Between medical bills and training costs, the family hasn't had  
an easy time. But Zivanovic's success brings a joy to his mother 
that's better than any physical therapy or medication, Visconti 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He plays it down, but she's not doing well,'' Visconti said of  
Glenda Zivanovic, who watched her son's performance from the 
handicapped seats. ``They're a very close-knit family. The mom is 
very, very supportive, and this sport is keeping her living because 
she feels needed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Zivanovic isn't done yet, Visconti said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Trifun's a late bloomer,'' said Visconti, a two-time U.S.  
champion and world bronze medalist. ``For a young man, he's 
maturing slowly, which is good. The reason I stick with him is 
because I see a tremendous amount of improvement yet to be done 
both athletically and artistically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Danielle and Steve Hartsell won their first pairs title, edging  
Kyoko Ina, who won two U.S. crowns with former partner Jason 
Dungjen but now skates with John Zimmerman. Laura Handy and J. Paul 
Binnebose were third. 
</P>
<P>
	Naomi Lang and Peter Tchernyshev won their first ice dancing  
title.

<HEADLINE> Ads: Wine Is Fine Anytime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Would Madame care for some wine with her  
curly fries? 
</P>
<P>
	The wine industry begins testing an advertising campaign this  
week here and in Austin, Texas, aimed at deflating its stuffy, 
special-occasion-only image. A series of radio and television spots 
will playfully claim that wine is fine any time, be it while 
watching TV or eating a no-frills dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	The media campaign's tag line: ``Wine. What are you saving it  
for?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The perception of wine as a formal, special occasion beverage  
keeps a lot of people from enjoying it in casual and relaxed 
settings,'' said John Gillespie, president of the Wine Market 
Council. The California-based industry group is bankrolling the 
$1.3 million test campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Wine consumption in the United States has grown in recent years,  
but slowly. The council noted that recent gains have come mostly 
from what they call ``core wine drinkers'' -- a group consisting 
primarily of people over 40 who consume about 88 percent of the 
wine sold in America. 
</P>
<P>
	Targets of the new campaign are younger, infrequent wine  
drinkers. The lure is humor, as in one commercial that announces: 
``You're actually home watching TV? This is a special occasion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While no one expects burly blue-collar guys to soon be shouting  
``It's merlot time!'' after their shifts, the campaign created by 
Bozell Worldwide is intended to at least adjust consumer attitudes 
about wine. (Bozell is the advertising agency that has done the 
``Got Milk'' and ``Pork: The Other White Meat'' campaigns.) 
</P>
<P>
	Greg Prince, executive editor of Beverage World Magazine, said  
that while wine sales are inching up, they're not keeping up with 
the burgeoning soft drink and bottled water market. 
</P>
<P>
	Anything the industry could do to generate everyday wine  
consumption would help it, he said, ``as long as it doesn't 
diminish its specialness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Albany and Austin were chosen for the pilot campaign because  
they are typical mid-sized media markets with a good number of 
infrequent wine drinkers aged 25 to 49, said Bozell's Angie 
Fegeras.

<HEADLINE> Stock Market Remains Mysterious / Ticker Talk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- If such a thing is possible, the stock market in  
the late 1990s seems to be getting even harder to figure out than 
it was before. 
</P>
<P>
	According to academic theories of the ``efficient market,'' the  
question of where stock prices will go next has always been an 
unsolvable riddle. The doctrine says that everything that can be 
known or suspected is already factored into stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
	But at least in the old days, it usually seemed as though there  
were some sort of prevailing trend in the marketplace, whether up, 
down or neutral. 
</P>
<P>
	In the postmodern stock market, by contrast, everything seems to  
be crosscurrents within the market, moves from one type of stock or 
industry group to another. Thus, you may experience such strange 
phenomena as supposed bull markets where you don't make much money. 
</P>
<P>
	Take right now, for instance. Asked what the stock market has  
done so far in 1999, an investor might be hard-pressed to give any 
sort of clear-cut answer. 
</P>
<P>
	``The market has something for everyone,'' observes Norman  
Fosback in the newsletter Mutual Fund Forecaster in Deerfield 
Beach, Fla. ``Superbullish? Focus on funds specializing in the very 
largest stocks, especially those with a technology orientation. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bearish? Then take note that approximately two-fifths of all  
equity funds are BELOW their levels of last April.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To judge by the best-known market averages, 1998 was a terrific  
year for stocks. ``But what you don't see in the numbers is that it 
was also a very volatile year,'' notes Bob Hill, technical research 
strategist at Fidelity Investments in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	While the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock composite index climbed  
more than 25 percent, ``the average stock traded on the New York 
Stock Exchange ended the year down 6 percent,'' Hill says. 
``There's really no historical precedent for the market we had in 
1998.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This confusion matches up with the way many people seem to feel  
about the U.S. economy. While the news on growth, employment and 
inflation remains amazingly positive, many commentators are 
constantly fretting that it is too good to last. 
</P>
<P>
	If we don't get a revival of inflation, they say, then we will  
get intensifying deflation that could have dire consequences. 
Besides, even if nothing bad happens right away, the stock market 
has already discounted all the good news, and is dangerously 
overpriced. 
</P>
<P>
	To many advocates of long-term investing, all this provides a  
perfect demonstration of the paralysis-by-analysis problem -- or how 
hard it is to invest successfully if you insist on plunking down 
your money only when you can clearly perceive that it is a good 
time to buy. 
</P>
<P>
	As L. Roy Papp, who heads a Phoenix money-management firm  
bearing his name, put it: ``Things are so good that I anticipate a 
new wave of fear worrying about how good things are.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More and more professional investors, including many of the top  
managers of stock mutual funds, say they don't even try to make 
sense of the stock market's last short-term swing or what its next 
move might be. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather, they concentrate on maintaining a diversified portfolio  
of investments carefully selected on their individual, fundamental 
merits, without much regard for timing. 
</P>
<P>
	One way to cut through the confusion, Papp suggests, is to  
consider the alternatives when you are trying to decide whether you 
want to be in or out of stocks. ``(U.S.) stocks have gone up a 
lot,'' he acknowledges, ``but they are still more attractive than 
bonds, gold, commodities, foreign stocks or currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things are not perfect. They are probably only the best times  
we have had in our entire lives.''

<HEADLINE> Man Has Skied 3,000 Straight Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARRABASSETT VALLEY, Maine (AP) -- It's simply called ``The  
Streak.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Schipper, 75, started in 1981 skiing every day that  
Sugarloaf USA was open, and he hasn't stopped. Sunday was his 
3,000th consecutive day of skiing. 
</P>
<P>
	He already was looking ahead after starting his day by skiing  
down the resort's black diamond Narrow Gauge trail. He wants to 
extend the streak to 5,000, which would take another 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something to shoot for,'' he said. ``I don't think it's  
impossible. I ski with a lot of guys who are in their 80s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schipper's streak has made a local celebrity of the former  
fighter pilot and commercial airline pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, he and Olympic moguls gold medalist Jonny Moseley  
led a parade that included several hundred children who skied down 
the mountain. People were still congratulating him Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Schipper retired from flying in 1972 to do something he always  
wanted to do: open a ski lodge and ski every day. He sold the 
Lumberjack Lodge two years ago, but he stills skis every day. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's still the iron man,'' his son, Jeff Schipper, said. ``No  
one thought it would go this far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It hasn't always been easy.  
</P>
<P>
	Schipper has skied in horrible conditions, including rain,  
blizzards and minus-70 windchills. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, he broke a thumb during a spill but never stopped  
skiing. He brought the handle of the ski pole with him to the 
doctor's office so a cast could be made to fit around it. 
</P>
<P>
	In the spring of 1993, Schipper delayed surgery to remove a  
cancerous kidney so he could keep skiing. In 1995, he underwent 
triple bypass heart surgery during the off-season. The heart 
surgeon also replaced one of his heart valves with a valve from a 
pig. 
</P>
<P>
	Both times, Schipper recuperated in time to resume his streak  
when the snow began falling in late October. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, it's been easy.  
</P>
<P>
	``It hasn't been that hard lately,'' Schipper said. ``It's  
become a routine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schipper is wearing a helmet for the first time this year. He  
also has the latest hourglass-shaped parabolic skis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not as fast as I used to be,'' he said. ``When I'm with a  
group, I'm tail-end Charlie. I used to be leading the group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The way he talked Sunday, skiing every day for another 10 years  
seems like no big deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way I feel, I don't see why I can't do it,'' he said.  
``This year it's going good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he occasionally thinks about the day he must quit. It's an  
idea his wife doesn't entertain. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll keep it up,'' said Christine Schipper, a Tennessee  
native who doesn't like the cold. ``If he doesn't want to, I'll 
force him. It gets him out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't imagine getting up and saying I don't have to do it  
any more,'' Schipper said. ``So I'll stick to it.''

<HEADLINE> Union Ratifies Detroit Papers Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Members of one of the six union locals that  
struck the city's daily newspapers for 19 months beginning in 1995 
approved a contract agreement on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal covers 98 members of International Typographers Union  
Local 18, said Shawn Ellis, spokesman for the Metropolitan Council 
of Newspaper Unions. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreement is the first reached between the newspapers and  
one of the formerly striking unions since the walkout. Members of 
the local create ads and prepare advertising and news materials for 
publication. 
</P>
<P>
	Susie Ellwood, vice president of market development for Detroit  
Newspapers Inc., said the contract is a 10-year agreement that 
includes an increase in pension contributions, a contractual 
four-day work week, a 5 percent increase in midnight shift premium 
and a 19.5 percent increase in wages over the terms of the 
contract, or 2 percent a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Six union locals representing about 2,500 workers walked out in  
July 1995 against the Detroit Free Press, The Detroit News and 
Detroit Newspapers, which runs the papers' business and production 
operations under a joint operating agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	The unions made an unconditional offer to return to their jobs  
and end the walkout Feb. 14, 1997. The newspapers accepted the 
offer five days later. 
</P>
<P>
	But the unions said the newspapers in effect rejected their  
offer because of the newspapers' vow to retain their 1,200 
replacement workers -- leaving few jobs immediately available for 
returning former strikers. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspapers and the agency have been bringing back former  
strikers as jobs become available.

<HEADLINE> Indians More Likely To Be Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American Indians are more than twice as likely  
as others to become victims of violent crime, the Justice 
Department reported Sunday in its first comprehensive analysis of 
Indians and crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics also found that on  
any given day one in 25 Indian adults is either incarcerated or on 
parole or probation. And reports of child abuse have soared among 
Indians in recent years, even as that problem seemed to ease 
elsewhere in the population. 
</P>
<P>
	``People need to know how desperate it is,'' said Kathleen  
Bliss, a federal prosecutor in New Mexico. ``Violent crime in 
Indian country is increasing while it goes down nationally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indians suffer 124 violent crimes -- murders, assaults, robberies  
and rapes -- for every 100,000 population. That's double the violent 
crime rate for blacks and 2 1/2 half times the national average of 50. 
</P>
<P>
	The murder rate among Indians is no higher than for whites, and  
only a fifth as high as among blacks. But Indians are twice as 
likely as blacks and three times more likely than whites to be 
victims of rape or aggravated assault. 
</P>
<P>
	Family violence overall is no bigger problem among Indians than  
it is in the rest of the population, the study found. 
</P>
<P>
	But Indian children are more likely to be abused than those of  
any other ethnic group. Reports of child abuse and neglect among 
Indians jumped 18 percent between 1992 and 1995 as the national 
rate was falling by 8 percent. The study offered no explanation for 
the increase, but law-enforcement officials said it could be due to 
better reporting. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 63,000 Indians, or 4 percent of the adult  
population, are jailed or otherwise under control of the criminal 
justice system on an average day. That compares to 2 percent of 
whites and 10 percent of blacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, based on surveys and crime records, couldn't  
distinguish between Indians who live in cities and those on 
reservations, nor did it track year-to-year trends in the crime 
rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-fourths of the 2 million Indians nationwide live on  
reservations, and many of the rest are concentrated in urban areas 
such as Denver, Minneapolis and Phoenix. Law-enforcement officials 
believe that crime among Indians has been on the rise in recent 
years, driven partly by a proliferation of youth gangs. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are so many reasons'' for the crime, said Robert  
Thunder, a Minneapolis police officer who works with Indian gangs 
both in the city and on reservations. ``The home life could be one, 
the peer pressure, their environments.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, a study by federal law-enforcement officials and tribal  
leaders declared a ``public safety crisis'' on the nation's 
reservations and proposed to double the size of their police 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Clinton administration's request, Congress increased  
spending on Indian law enforcement by more than 80 percent, or $108 
million, to pay for new jails, patrol cars and up to 1,000 
additional officers. The administration has asked for another $145 
million increase in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``Resources are never the complete answer, but they certainly  
would help in Indian country,'' said Frank Pommersheim, a 
University of South Dakota law professor who serves as an appellate 
judge for some Sioux tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playing catch-up is going to take a while,'' said Ted Quasula,  
director of law enforcement for the Bureau of Indian Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1997 study said there were 1,600 BIA and tribal officers  
patrolling 56 million acres of Indian land. That's 1.3 officers for 
every 1,000 residents, compared with 2.9 police officers per 1,000 
residents in non-Indian rural communities. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Navajo reservation, fewer than one officer is on duty per  
1,000 residents, and a single police officer typically must patrol 
an average 10,000 square miles by himself.

<HEADLINE> Diallo's Body Flown to Guinea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Thousands of people in everything from trucks,  
taxis, beat-up cars and shiny Mercedes Benzes gathered Sunday in a 
sendoff to a West African immigrant whose death at the hands of 
police has outraged the black community. 
</P>
<P>
	A motorcade of somber supporters assembled outside the  
headquarters of the Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network in 
Harlem and accompanied Amadou Diallo's family to Newark 
International Airport as they prepared to fly his body home to 
Guinea for burial. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was in the midst of all this pain, a beautiful sight to see  
all these brothers and sisters driving down the highway,'' said 
Sharpton, who was to accompany the family to Africa. ``As we go to 
Guinea we must continue the struggle for justice here. ... This 
cannot be the end, but the beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four plainclothes police officers fired 41 bullets at Diallo,  
22, as he stood in the vestibule of his apartment house in the 
Bronx on Feb. 3. Many have questioned why so many shots were fired. 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney for the officers has said that police thought he was  
armed. At the time, the officers were searching for a rapist, who 
is still at large. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting is being investigated by the Bronx district  
attorney's office with the assistance of the FBI. The officers have 
been placed on administrative non-enforcement duty. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, many of the thousands who took part in the motorcade  
said were trying to prevent another killing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am doing this so they don't shoot any more of our people,''  
said a taxi driver who identified herself only as Fatima. ``If we 
didn't protest certain things, we'd still have no civil rights, no 
human rights.''

<HEADLINE> Earnhardt Fails To Defend Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- He darted in, he darted out, he  
darted in again. 
</P>
<P>
	But not even Dale Earnhardt could intimidate Jeff Gordon on  
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Or beat him.  
</P>
<P>
	Trailing Gordon by inches with one lap left, everyone sat  
waiting for that final dramatic passing attempt as Earnhardt tried 
to defend his first Daytona 500 title. 
</P>
<P>
	It appeared to be time for yet another vintage Earnhardt moment:  
wait until the end and figure out a way -- any way -- to get to the 
front when it counts. 
</P>
<P>
	But with his foot all the way to the floor and Gordon setting  
the pace in front, there was no move to be made. 
</P>
<P>
	The car -- limited by the restrictor plate used by all drivers at  
Daytona -- had nothing left. And not even Earnhardt could make a 
race-winning move under those conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I couldn't really muster much on Jeff,'' Earnhardt said. ``His  
car was stronger ... I just never could get to him. I never got a 
chance to get a bumper under him. It just wasn't meant to be, I 
reckon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Only after they crossed the finish line did Earnhardt catch  
Gordon, giving him a congratulatory bump as they lapped the track 
one more time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he was showing me how much fun he was having,'' Gordon  
said. ``He gave me a little donut, then he waved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But there was no celebration for Earnhardt, no using his car to  
carve circles in the grass, the way he did last year when he 
finally took the only major championship to elude him over his 
25-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	And there was no repeat, a la John Elway, the Denver Broncos  
quarterback who won two straight Super Bowls and inspired 
Earnhardt. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, it was a fifth second-place finish at Daytona, making  
him the all-time leader in that category, passing Cale Yarbrough. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to thank Dale for a great race,'' said Gordon, giving  
the courteous tip of the hat rarely seen from his older, more surly 
competitor known as The Intimidator. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's taught me so much out there. He's probably going to tell  
you I learned too much from him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It showed over the final 10 laps.  
</P>
<P>
	Gordon and Earnhardt took a wild, daring trip through the pack,  
moving from eighth and 10th place to knock teammates Rusty Wallace 
and Jeremy Mayfield out of the lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Then came the Gordon-Earnhardt showdown that has been seen  
all-too-rarely over the years. It was everything racing fans could 
have hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd have to say they got their money's worth today,''  
Earnhardt said. 
</P>
<P>
	Said Gordon: ``Even though we battled for a (points)  
championship in '95, we really didn't get to have many tight 
battles all the way to the finish. I really can't think of a better 
way to do it than here at the Daytona 500.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon set the pace over the final laps, slowing and speeding at  
the perfect time, keeping just the right amount of air between 
their cars to keep Earnhardt from using the draft to slingshot past 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt's best hope would have been to get a bump from  
teammate Mike Skinner, but Skinner was in fourth, pinned behind 
rookie Kenny Irwin. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he could have used Skinner's help, Earnhardt snapped.  
</P>
<P>
	``How do you take a car out from between us and get (Skinner)  
behind me,'' he said. ``It's not like he can say, `Hey I'm moving 
up,' and just drive over the other guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With no help from behind, a savvy driver in front and no way of  
generating any more power from his own car, Earnhardt settled for 
second. 
</P>
<P>
	He figured that wasn't bad, considering that engine troubles had  
dropped him to the middle of the pack, almost an afterthought until 
the final, wild 10 laps of the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was pretty physical out there,'' he said. ``Just to survive  
that last five or 10 laps was a good thing, it was pretty awesome 
just to come home and finish. We were happy to get second.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But as everyone has learned over the years -- especially last  
year -- he really would have preferred Victory Lane.

<HEADLINE> De La Hoya Finally Earns Respect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Respect. Oscar De La Hoya earned it by  
outpointing Ike Quartey, then said he gave his opponent too much of 
it in the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've just got to go out there and fight,'' the WBC  
welterweight champion said of his split-decision victory Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya, who had said Quartey would be the toughest test of  
his career, got up from a sixth-round knockdown, won the last three 
rounds on all three cards and knocked down the challenger and 
almost stopped him in the 12th round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I beat one of the best in the world out there,'' said De La  
Hoya, now 30-0, with 24 knockouts. Quartey of Ghana, a former WBA 
champion who was stripped of that title, lost for the first time 
against 34 wins, 29 by knockouts, and one draw. 
</P>
<P>
	There was talk of a rematch, as there always is after a good  
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to fight all the best fighters out there,'' De La Hoya  
said. ``If I beat the best, then I'll give him a rematch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A fight between De La Hoya and the winner of a bout between  
unbeaten IBF champion Felix Trinidad and Pernell Whitaker on 
Saturday in Madison Square Garden would be attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker lost a disputed decision to De La Hoya in 1997. The WBA  
champion is James Page. Several good super lightweights also could 
move up to challenge De La Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
	First, De La Hoya is expected to defend against Oba Carr. Carr  
won a 10-round decision over Frankie Randall on the pay-per-view 
card in the Thomas &AMP; Mack Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the sixth-round knockdown that came after De La Hoya had  
dropped Quartey earlier in the round, De La Hoya said: ``I thought, 
`Hey, I'm going to get right back up and stay in this fight.' I'm 
not a quitter. 
</P>
<P>
	``He showed tremendous heart,'' said Gil Clancy, De La Hoya's  
co-trainer. ``That's what won it for him. He spent the entire fight 
fighting Quartey's fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I won the fight,'' Quartey said. ``I did everything.  
He did nothing. He came to survive. That's all he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya, however, appeared to have won most of the close  
rounds by being busier. 
</P>
<P>
	After 11 rounds, De La Hoya trailed by three points on one card,  
and led by two and one on the other two. 
</P>
<P>
	``Robert (Alcazar, the co-trainer) told him to go out and look  
good in this round,'' Clancy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Truly, I thought I was in total control,'' De La Hoya said.  
``I never thought I had to come back dramatically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever he thought, De La Hoya took Alcazar's advice. He  
knocked down Quartey with a left hook early in the round, then 
trapped him on the ropes and landed a barrage of 17 punches. 
Quartey punched back enough to keep the fight from being stopped. 
</P>
<P>
	All three judges gave De La Hoya a two-point round, making the  
final tallies 115-114 for Quartey and 115-112 and 115-113 for De La 
Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press card favored De La Hoya 116-111.

<HEADLINE> Hyde Was Driven by Impeachment Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Early on, the top House prosecutor said  
impeachment should move through Congress on its own momentum. ``We 
will not drive this investigation,'' Rep. Henry Hyde said. 
</P>
<P>
	He became the chauffeur.  
</P>
<P>
	The Republican congressman from Illinois, known for being smart,  
articulate and fair-minded, initially said a president shouldn't be 
impeached for a peccadillo. Hyde told his colleagues to check their 
politics at the door, that a presidential impeachment without 
bipartisan support would carry little weight. 
</P>
<P>
	Bipartisanship proved elusive.  
</P>
<P>
	``There was never a Democrat willing to concede an inch,'' Hyde  
now says. ``I bent over backwards to have a bipartisan, fair 
process, but it was impossible to please the Democrats. Partisan 
became an epithet they hurled at us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His critics say Hyde's handling of impeachment bordered on  
obsession and dented his reputation as an evenhanded lawmaker. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people were counting on Henry Hyde to avoid this sort  
of debacle -- the partisanship, the going forward when it didn't 
make sense to go forward,'' said Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass. ``He 
said we couldn't do it if it was partisan, and then they went ahead 
in a partisan way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde's supporters say his commitment to impeachment buffs his  
image as a man of conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am so sick of listening to those Democrats whining about the  
unfairness of Henry Hyde when he did everything to accommodate 
their every whim,'' said David Schippers, chief Republican 
investigator on the House Judiciary Committee. ``If I sound mad, I 
am mad. I'm mad at those guys who've been sniping at the most 
honorable man I know, saying he was partisan.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats say Hyde, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee,  
showed his partisan colors when he led Republicans in a standing 
ovation for Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr after he testified 
before the panel. No Democrat stood. 
</P>
<P>
	They say Hyde decried censure options as ``impeachment lite.''  
Hyde lobbied for impeachment votes in the House, in part, by 
pointing out that the Senate still could shelve the whole affair, 
Frank said. Then, when impeachment moved to the Senate, the 
Democrats say Hyde pressed the case even though he knew there 
wasn't a two-thirds majority to convict and remove Clinton from 
office. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there is a sense that winning became everything -- like  
the Vince Lombardi approach,'' Frank said in reference to the pro 
football coach. 
</P>
<P>
	That sentiment angers Schippers. ``If there was ever a man who  
operated from his conscience, it was Henry Hyde,'' he says. ``He 
kept going not because he's a Republican, not because he's a 
conservative. He believed in his heart of hearts that this man 
committed impeachable offenses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hyde knew opinion polls didn't back impeachment. Still, as  
President Clinton's approval ratings soared, Hyde pushed for a 
full-blown trial in the Senate, expressing dismay in the well of 
the chamber when he was allowed just a ``pitiful three'' witnesses, 
and those only on videotape. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more we made our case, the stronger we felt about it,''  
Hyde said. ``We understood our position was not a popular one. It 
was a principled one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In making his case, Hyde told how an 8-year-old Chicago boy  
wrote him to ask: ``If you cannot believe the president, who can 
you believe?'' He referenced the founding fathers, the Ten 
Commandments and the Magna Carta. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the case was not about sex, or even lying about sex. It  
was, he insisted, about lying under oath and obstructing justice. 
And in between, Hyde went home to read, smoke cigars, talk to his 
four children on the phone and listen to music, including a compact 
disc of ``Man of La Mancha.''

	The impeachment took a personal toll, including the revelation  
of the 74-year-old congressman's extramarital affair when he was in 
his 40s. Confidants say it was emotionally painful, but Hyde, a 
widower, easily won re-election in November to a 13th term with 67 
percent of the vote.	   Impeachment did cost him some support in his district, an 
affluent heavily Republican section of suburban Chicago. A recent 
Chicago Tribune poll showed more than a third of voters said they 
now have a lower opinion of Hyde. 
</P>
<P>
	``You start hearing comments about how he is far more partisan  
than people had expected and that he seems to be more vindictive 
than people expected,'' said Don Rose, a political consultant in 
Chicago. But he added: ``I don't think it's going to cost him his 
seat or anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Christopher Shays of Connecticut, one of only four  
Republicans in the House to vote against all four articles of 
impeachment, said if historians view the Clinton impeachment as a 
sensible endeavor, Hyde will get favorable reviews. If they don't, 
his legacy will be stained. 
</P>
<P>
	``Henry is one of the most thoughtful members of Congress,''  
Shays said. ``But everyone who got caught up in this mess has been 
hurt in terms of reputation, stature, status.''

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Urges Rubber Cartel To End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Malaysia has called on the  
International Natural Rubber Organization, a global rubber industry 
cartel, to stop its work as soon as possible, a newspaper said 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Malaysia, one of the world's leading exporters of rubber, has  
accused rubber consumer countries, which are also part of the 
cartel, of being unfair to producer countries by keeping rubber 
prices down. 
</P>
<P>
	The organization, known as the INRO, was set up in 1978 to bring  
together rubber producer countries and rubber consumer countries. 
It stabilizes rubber prices by regulating demand and supply in the 
international market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though INRO bought more than 10,000 tons of rubber  
recently, prices have continued to plunge,'' Primary Industries 
Minister Lim Keng Yaik was quoted as saying in the Sun newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	The recent decision by Malaysia and Thailand to leave the  
grouping will force much of the world's natural rubber to be traded 
according to supply and demand, Lim said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also said that Malaysia and Thailand have to wait a year  
before their departure from INRO can take effect.

<HEADLINE> Women May Hurt Their Knees More </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Running in a more upright position may make  
women more likely to sustain knee injuries, a study says. 
</P>
<P>
	Videos of female athletes show that they run in -- and change  
direction from -- a less crouched position than men do. And a 
researcher thinks this more straight-legged approach may put more 
pressure on the knee. 
</P>
<P>
	He believes the additional force helps to account for women's  
higher rates of damaging tears to the anterior cruciate ligament 
that helps to bind together the lower and upper leg bones. 
</P>
<P>
	``When they go to make these turns and pivots, their hips are  
straighter and their knees are straighter -- more upright, less 
squatting,'' said Dr. William Garrett Jr. of the University of 
North Carolina, Chapel Hill. He presented his findings Feb. 8 at a 
meeting of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons in Anaheim, 
Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	With more force on the front of the leg, women rely more than  
men do on the quadriceps muscles in the front, and less on the 
hamstrings in the back, to control their movements, Garrett said. 
And the additional tightening of the muscles in the front may 
create more strain on the ligaments in the front, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The quadriceps muscles have enough force to tear ACLs with the  
knee at least near full extension,'' Garrett said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ligament tears, while not rare, are not all that common. NCAA  
data find female soccer and basketball players were three to four 
times more likely than men to be injured. 
</P>
<P>
	But among every 15 soccer players, only one injury would occur  
in every 385 games and practices for the men, while one would occur 
for every 161 games and practices for the women. But the injuries 
can require surgery to repair, and they can in some cases end an 
athletic career. 
</P>
<P>
	In his research, Garrett and his colleagues looked at 11 male  
and eight female well-trained, recreational-level athletes. The 
researchers used three-dimensional videos to examine movement and 
attached electrodes to the muscles to measure contraction. 
</P>
<P>
	About halfway through crosscutting, the males' knees were flexed  
at about 55 degrees, while the females were at a less-squatted 45 
degrees, Garrett said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We and others have thought that women in games play more  
upright,'' Garrett said. The study adds data to support this, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	However, while the study indicates the stance difference  
accounts at least in part for the different rates of injury in men 
and women, it does not provide proof. 
</P>
<P>
	The project did not follow a large number of athletes and see  
who got injured. So Garrett said he cannot assure women that 
training to run in a more bent-kneed position will reduce the risk. 
</P>
<P>
	It's too soon to tell how much importance to give stance as a  
cause of injury to the tendon, said Dr. Letha Griffin, team 
physician for Georgia State University, Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	``With every theory, we have problems and holes,'' Griffin said.  
The orthopaedic surgeons' group is trying to convene a consensus 
conference to give better guidance, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other factors also could account for the differences in injury  
rates, such as differences in male and female biomechanics -- even 
hormones, commented Dr. Edward M. Wojtys of the University of 
Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	But stance is a promising cause, not only because the data look  
good but because stance could be corrected through training, Wojtys 
said. ``We all hope it's not anatomy; it's the hardest to change,'' 
he said. ``We want to put all our emphasis right now on the 
biomechanical.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Scandal Inspires the Arts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Picture Monica Lewinsky on stage, bathed in a purple spotlight,  
belting out ``Maybe I'm Crazy,'' to a bathrobe-clad Linda Tripp, 
fiddling with her tape recorder. Imagine listening to the Starr 
Report set to opera, with President Clinton as a tenor and Lewinsky 
as a mezzo-soprano. Or a poem -- ``And I Never Asked Her to Lie.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After a year of perspective on the Clinton scenario from sexual  
therapists, lawyers, priests and political pundits, certain 
viewpoints are best expressed through the arts and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	The yearlong saga has inspired nightly comedy by Jay Leno and  
David Letterman, daily political cartoons, Broadway-style musicals, 
somber plays, erotic sketches, oil paintings and blues ballads. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas composer Steve Hilton wrote ``Under Oath: A Political  
Cantata,'' a collection of 12 operatic pieces, after reading the 
testimony given to Kenneth Starr's grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	``The more I read it, I thought, `This isn't just poetry,  
they're lyrics,''' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	One of Hilton's pieces juxtaposed a part of Lewinsky's testimony  
in which she says that ``wherever there's physical intimacy ... 
there was always kissing,'' with the president testifying that he 
believed kissing wasn't even worth mentioning to prosecutors. 
``Kissing is not covered,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very theatrical when you put those two side by side,''  
Hilton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Director and choreographer Daniel Henning said he told the  
singers in ``Starr Struck: A Musical Investigation,'' not to worry 
about whether or not to play it straight. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't parody parody, and what's been going on in  
Washington is parody. So just tell the truth and it will be 
funny,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Starr Struck,'' which opened in Los Angeles Thursday, includes  
the songs ``Nose Job,'' ``Sex is Dirty,'' ``How Many Paulas?'' 
(sung by Hillary) and ``DNA,'' in which Starr sings: ``There's a 
stain on the presidency, Mr. President, the stain's plain to see on 
the dress, Mr. President. But I've got you, 'cause I've got your 
D-N-A.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Artists' reaction to this scandal focuses more on parody and  
silliness, unlike the work that commented on the assassination of 
John F. Kennedy, or the Vietnam War, said Art Simon, a film studies 
professor at Montclair State College. 
</P>
<P>
	Artists working at the time of JFK's death wanted to chronicle  
another interpretation of the killing because they didn't trust the 
government, said Simon, the author of ``Dangerous Knowledge: The 
JFK Assassination in Art and Film.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think more serious work will come after a certain amount of  
reflection,'' he said of the latest national obsession. 
</P>
<P>
	New York City artist Claudia Hart said she made the book ``Fun  
With Bill and Monica'' to reflect Americans' anxiety with the 
sexual nature of the story. A dark spin-off on ``Dick and Jane,'' 
the book includes simple children's poems and erotic drawings. Ken 
Starr is a devil-like figure. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened was an attempted coup d'etat by the Christian  
right and they did it by appealing to people's most infantile 
instincts -- this fear of sex which is very problematic for 
Americans,'' she said. ``So everyone became infantile kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sabrina Peck, director of ``The Trials of Monica Lewinsky,''  
said the play was a way to find Lewinsky, the person, beneath 
endless news articles and video snippets. It will be shown at the 
U.S. Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen, Colo. next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I came to realize was it took theater to humanize the  
person,'' she said. ``Theater has always been that means by which 
we try and make sense of the world -- it's our way of trying to make 
sense of what happened, what's at the root of this social 
phenomenon.''

<HEADLINE> Navy Develops Ear Protectors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PENSACOLA, Fla. (AP) -- Low-frequency noise such as the  
whomp-whomp of helicopter rotor blades can be more than just 
annoying. Research indicates it can raise blood pressure and hasten 
fatigue. 
</P>
<P>
	Navy scientists assigned to develop ear protectors for  
helicopter crews found no material on the market that would 
adequately block the sound, so they invented a new technology. 
</P>
<P>
	Their patented solution shows so much promise that commercial  
interests are lining up to use it in appliances, automobiles, 
airplanes, spacecraft, ships and buildings as well as for ear cups, 
said Capt. Bob Hain, science and technology director at the Naval 
Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a technology as opposed to a material,'' said Gerry  
Thomas, head of acoustics for the lab at Pensacola Naval Air 
Station. ``So far every material that we've attempted to apply the 
technology to, we've been successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That includes epoxy resins, silicon gels, polyurethane foam,  
plastics and silicon- and carbon-based rubbers, said Thomas, who 
has a Ph.D. in acoustics from the University of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Tests show, depending on the application, the technology can  
improve sound absorption by 50 percent to 1,000 percent. A 
quarter-inch thickness can block as much sound as a foot of 
concrete. 
</P>
<P>
	Mold-Ex Rubber of nearby Milton is licensed to use the process  
in certain products and over the past two years sold Ford Motor Co. 
more than 1 million exhaust recirculation hoses that reduce engine 
noise. Production, however, has discontinued because Ford made a 
design change that solved the problem another way, said Bruce Guy, 
Mold-Ex vice president and technical director. 
</P>
<P>
	Later this year, he said, the company, a subsidiary of Norfolk,  
Va.-based Southland Technologies Inc., will begin using the formula 
in rubber and plastic protectors as well as foam insulation for 
boat builders. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas and co-inventor Bill Cushman, who worked on the project  
on a contract basis, relied on basic physics for their sound 
solution. 
</P>
<P>
	``We knew that laminates of different materials were better than  
homogeneous materials in blocking lower frequencies,'' Thomas said. 
Sound waves lose energy at the point where dissimilar materials 
meet, but such layering would be impractical for ear cups. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wondered if it would work using very small particles that  
were very dissimilar since progression of sound requires molecular 
collisions,'' Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	The answer was yes, but it took 41 attempts before they arrived  
at a correct balance of high- and low-impedance particles. ``The 
formula is very specific,'' Thomas said. ``If you are off by a 
couple parts per hundred, you lose the effect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The technology works across the frequency spectrum but is  
particularly prized for its low-frequency performance because 
nothing else has been effective in that range, Guy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Molded products such as the ear protectors represent only a  
small fraction of potential uses so the lab now is focused on 
perfecting materials in sheet and spray-on forms. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the big enchilada,'' Thomas said. ``It's just been this  
past summer that we've had a sufficient number of breakthroughs 
because the science involved with large sheets is very different 
than the science involved with small surface areas and airborne 
sound.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lab also has approached Florida State and Florida A&AMP;M  
universities for help in applying the technology to high-strength 
composites such as those used to make aircraft. A chemical company 
wants to try it with fibers, including Kevlar, a main component in 
helmets, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
	Since initial research in 1993-95, Cushman's contract has  
expired but he is working independently to advance the concept in 
what he termed a friendly competition with the Navy lab. 
</P>
<P>
	He has patented the use of discarded tires, frozen and broken  
into crumbs, as a low-cost raw material and a more expensive 
approach combining various technologies. 
</P>
<P>
	Cushman, who has a Ph.D. in sensory psychology from the  
University of Maryland, also has joined with Intelligent Automation 
Inc. of Rockville, Md., to develop headsets for the Navy that can 
be used in noisy environments. They are in the first months of a 
two-year contract to combine soundproof ear cups with microphones 
that digitally cancel background noise. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy lab has spent nearly $2 million developing its  
technology, but if sheet materials prove successful that investment 
will be returned within months in manufacturing royalties, Thomas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The military will reap other benefits just from better hearing  
protectors that can be worn around jet engines, big guns and other 
noisy environments. 
</P>
<P>
	The Navy spent $37.5 million in one year -- 1995 -- on hearing  
disabilities and the Department of Veterans Affairs paid out $3.68 
billion from 1968 through 1995, Hain said. 
</P>
<P>
	Noise ``not only affects someone's hearing,'' he said. ``If you  
can't hear what's going on, it affects your ability to accomplish 
your mission.''

<HEADLINE>  Honduras Moves Homeless to Shelters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) -- Officials Sunday began moving  
thousands left homeless by Hurricane Mitch into giant, hastily 
built shelters, looking for a temporary solution to the housing 
crisis caused by the storm. 
</P>
<P>
	The ``macroshelters'' -- clusters of small rooms made of wooden  
frames, wallboard and chicken wire and with shared bathroom 
facilities -- have generated little enthusiasm among the homeless 
and the humanitarian aid organizations building them. 
</P>
<P>
	But with the need to clear schools and other buildings that have  
been used as shelters, they see few alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one is very happy about it, and no one has a better  
solution,'' said Beltrand Diego, head of the International 
Organization of Migration's Honduran mission. 
</P>
<P>
	About 10 shelters are expected to serve more than 20,000  
homeless people, said Diego, whose organization is overseeing the 
construction. The first shelter, built in a month, opened Sunday in 
Tegucigalpa for about 600 people. 
</P>
<P>
	The shelters are designed to be used for up to 13 months, which  
aid organizations believe will give them time to find permanent 
housing. Diego said no more than five people will live in a single 
room. The organizations and the government will provide health 
services and security. 
</P>
<P>
	Schoolbuses and pickup trucks moved the new residents from  
schools and churches where they have lived in cramped and 
unsanitary conditions since the hurricane. The late October storm 
hit Honduras hardest, killing thousands and causing billions of 
dollars in damage. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the homeless carried their few possessions in paper bags  
or a few cardboard boxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't be satisfied until I get my house,'' said Juana  
Martinez, 48, who moved with her five children. ``This shelter 
isn't my house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't like this place,'' added Fernando Avilez, 22.  
``Everything's pre-fabricated. This isn't a house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With classes beginning March 1 in Honduras, officials need to  
move people out of schools and find healthier homes for them. But 
there is a shortage of available land, especially in the capital of 
Tegucigalpa, and prices have risen with the growing demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Many large families left homeless and poor and can't find an  
affordable house. They include the family of Lesli Suyapa 
Valladares Orillana, who is pregnant with her eighth child and has 
been living in a classroom. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are searching for rooms, but there aren't any available  
because with so many children, no one wants to rent to us,'' she 
said.

<HEADLINE> Soccer Heads Wants 2-Yr World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- FIFA president Sepp Blatter repeated his  
call for the World Cup to be played every two years instead of 
four, but deflected questions Sunday about whether the Women's 
World Cup should follow a similar course. 
</P>
<P>
	Blatter, speaking at a news conference a few hours before the  
draw for this summer's Women's World Cup, said holding the men's 
event every two years would strengthen national teams. 
</P>
<P>
	With players frequently crossing national boundaries to play  
club soccer, Blatter said, the importance of the national teams is 
being diluted. Holding the World Cup more frequently could help 
address that problem, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Blatter's suggestion has been attacked by many other soccer  
officials worldwide, but the head of FIFA -- the world governing 
body for soccer -- said new ideas should not be rejected just 
because they would lead to change. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like when Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone,''  
said Blatter, who plans to report to FIFA's executive committee on 
March 11-12 about the proposal. ``People said, `We don't need it 
because we already have the telegraph.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about the Women's World Cup also going to a two-year  
schedule, Blatter did not answer directly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will be easier to have a Women's World Cup every  
two years than a men's World Cup every two years,'' he said with a 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	Blatter also said he favors experimenting with two referees in  
soccer matches, though only if such an experiment could take place 
over a full season. Trying it in only one competition would not be 
enough time to assess such a trial, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FIFA president pointed out that female referees will be used  
in the Women's World Cup, to be held in seven U.S. cities from June 
19-July 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think women will pay more respect to their gender in the  
game,'' said Blatter, who added that more women's referees must be 
trained. ``There will be so many women's matches in the future that 
we'll need the same number of women's officials as men's 
officials.''

	Clinton To Take Mexico Trip  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is plunging into a busy week  
following his Senate impeachment trial, starting with a trip today 
to Mexico. The president is holding a two-day summit with President 
Ernesto Zedillo in Merida on the Yucatan peninsula. Key issues are 
trade and drugs, with Clinton about to decide whether to re-certify 
Mexico as a full partner in the fight against narcotics 
trafficking. If he doesn't, the Mexicans stand to lose some U-S 
aid.

	McCain Says GOP Must Move On  
</P>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Sen. John McCain, fresh from voting for the  
Republicans' failed effort to convict President Clinton on 
impeachment articles, last night told a gathering of party 
moderates that the GOP must move on to important issues. ``We 
Republicans have a great deal of work to do to remind voters that

Republican, who is considering a presidential run in 2000.

	Judge Holds Pilot Union in Contempt  
</P>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- An irate federal judge yesterday held  
American Airlines' pilots union and two top board members in 
contempt and promised sizable fines against them, saying the union 
did not do enough to encourage pilots to return to work after a 
court order. More than half a million travelers have been left at 
the gate by the nation's second-largest airline because of the 
large number of pilots calling in sick. Although a judge had 
ordered the pilots Wednesday to quit their job action stemming from 
a dispute with management, about 1,700 of the airline's 9,400 
pilots remained on the sick list yesterday.

	US Troops Join Kosovo Peace Force  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As many as 4,000 American troops will go to  
Kosovo as part of a 28,000-strong NATO peacekeeping force if 
warring Serbs and ethnic Albanians reach a political settlement, 
President Clinton said yesterday. Clinton said that without a U.S. 
commitment, the warfare could bleed beyond Kosovo's borders -- into 
Albania, Macedonia, Greece, Turkey, and even re-ignite conflict in 
Bosnia. The president's commitment of U.S. personnel was timed to 
strengthen Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's hand as she flew 
to France to nudge stalled talks between the Serb government and 
ethnic Albanians seeking independence for Kosovo.

	Iraq Says U.S. Attack Killed Three  
</P>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- U.S. planes attacked sites in the southern  
``no fly'' zone Saturday, killing at least three civilians and 
injuring several others, Iraqi media reported. One group of planes 
``attacked a civilian installation,'' killing three civilians and 
wounding ``a number of others,'' the statement said. It also said 
jets attacked a residential area in southern Iraq, injuring several 
people. Saturday was the third straight day Iraq has claimed 
civilian casualties in the ``no-fly'' zones. The reports could not 
be independently verified.

	Microsoft Wins Piracy Case in China  
</P>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- A Beijing court has ordered two Chinese firms to  
pay $100,000 in compensation to Microsoft for using its software 
without authorization, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported 
yesterday. Beijing Haisida Science and Technology Development Co. 
and Min'an Investment Consulting Co. were found guilty of copyright 
infringement, Xinhua reported. Despite the relatively small damages 
ordered, the ruling may set a precedent for other software piracy 
cases in China, where most computers operate on pirated software. 
Court officials were not available for comment late yesterday.

	Suns Edge Clippers 107-104 in OT  
</P>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Rex Chapman, struggling to find his shot all  
season, scored 12 points in overtime last night and sent the 
Phoenix Suns past the winless Los Angeles Clippers 107-104. 
Chapman, just 5-of-19 when the fourth quarter ended tied at 93, 
made his first two shots in overtime, including a 3-pointer. He 
also hit 7-for-9 free throws to finish with 23 points. Phoenix's 
Jason Kidd knifed in front of Sherman Douglas to pick off an 
inbounds pass with two seconds to play, helping the Suns end a 
two-game skid.

	De La Hoya Beats Quartey

<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Oscar De La Hoya passed what he called the  
toughest test of his career, getting up from a knockdown and twice 
knocking down Ike Quartey to retain the WBC welterweight 
championship on a split decision last night. De La Hoya clinched 
the victory by storming out in the 12th round to knock down Quartey 
in just 12 seconds. The champion then pummeled Quartey for the next 
minute before tiring in front of a crowd of about 12,000.

<HEADLINE>  Carr Earns Welterweight Title Shot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Oba Carr won a lot more than a fight Saturday  
night against Frankie Randall. 
</P>
<P>
	He may have also won the biggest chance of his boxing career.  
</P>
<P>
	With a promised shot at Oscar De La Hoya to the winner, there  
was a lot more at stake than the $100,000 each fighter earned on 
the featured undercard fight before De La Hoya defended his WBC 
welterweight title against Ike Quartey. 
</P>
<P>
	Carr was the one who took advantage, dominating the fight  
against the 37-year-old former two-time junior welterweight 
champion from the second round on to win a unanimous 10-round 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
	``I fought a smart fight. I didn't come here for a knockout,''  
Carr said. ``He tried to hold on, tried to survive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There were no knockdowns in the fight, but Carr was clearly the  
faster and stronger fighter. He wore Randall down with body shots 
in the middle rounds and scored well with counter punches as 
Randall moved forward. 
</P>
<P>
	Judges Duane Ford and Jerry Roth had Carr winning 97-92, while  
Duane Ford scored it 99-90. The Associated Press had Carr winning 
99-90. 
</P>
<P>
	Randall, the first fighter to beat Julio Cesar Chavez, had a  
point taken from him in the seventh round for pushing Carr on a 
break, then hitting him with a right hand that sent Carr staggering 
across the ring. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I won the fight. It was a bad decision,'' Randall  
said. ``This is what always happens to me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Randall, 146, who held the WBA 140-pound title twice in his  
career, fell to 55-6-1. Carr, 148, improved to 48-2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	In another title fight, Erik Morales of Tijuana, Mexico, took a  
round to figure out Angel Chacon, then knocked him out with a 
spectacular flurry a round later to retain his WBC super 
batamweight title. 
</P>
<P>
	Morales knocked Chacon through the ropes with a three-punch  
flurry and referee Richard Steele moved in to immediately stop the 
fight with Chacon laying on his back on the ring apron. 
</P>
<P>
	Morales, 121 1/2, scored his 26th knockout in defending his title  
for the fifth time. His record improved to 32-0. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to make a statement,'' said Morales, who will defend  
his title May 8 against Wayne McCullough. ``It's a big fight 
night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chacon, 122, of Puerto Rico, was tentative from the opening bell  
but wasn't in serious trouble until Morales chased him across the 
ring early in the second round to land a flurry. 
</P>
<P>
	A few seconds later, Morales backed Chacon into the ropes and  
landed a big right followed by a left to the head. A right missed, 
but Morales connected with another left as Chacon (24-3) fell to 
the canvas. 
</P>
<P>
	In a pair of novelty fights, female boxer Mia St. John of  
Canoga, Park, Calif., won a unanimous four-round decision over 
Amanda Skelton of Fort Smith, Ark., while Eric ``Butterbean'' Esch 
knocked out Canada's Patrick Graham in the third round of a 
scheduled four-round fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Esch, who at 316 pounds outweighed Graham by 85 pounds, ran over  
to George Foreman at ringside after the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the grilling machine, George,'' he said. ``The grilling  
machine done this.''

<HEADLINE> Will GOP Face Backlash in 2000? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The fiercest of foes, President Clinton and  
congressional Republicans find their interests intersecting as the 
impeachment drama subsides and attention shifts to the upcoming 
legislative session, campaign 2000 and the president's own legacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans must pass serious legislation before the next  
elections to accomplish something other than impeaching the 
president. Clinton may need to sign serious legislation to improve 
a record stained by impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	But Democratic lawmakers fear that by helping himself, Clinton  
could cost them a shot at winning back control of the House. A 
little gridlock is better than too much compromise, Democratic 
leaders say. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has to decide one way or another: Whether his  
legacy is going to be in fashioning a compromise with Republicans 
who are desperate to do a deal with him, or whether his legacy is 
going to be drawing a bright line that helps us restore a 
Democratic majority in 2000,'' said Rep. Patrick Kennedy of Rhode 
Island, chairman of the Democratic House campaign committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton told Democrats last week that he would ``hold the line''  
in bargaining with Republicans over Social Security and Medicare. 
Kennedy said Democrats will hold him to that promise, knowing the 
president has a history of compromising with Republicans over the 
objections of Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this crowd (of Republicans) has stretched even his  
patience,'' Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
	The interplay between Clinton and GOP lawmakers is only one  
element in a political picture complicated by the 13-month Monica 
Lewinsky saga. 
</P>
<P>
	THE HOUSE: The Republicans' six-seat edge would be at risk even  
without impeachment as a factor. The issue poses an extra threat 
for GOP lawmakers, including a couple of House impeachment managers 
who serve districts with large numbers of Democratic voters. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans believe voters will not factor impeachment into  
their decisions 21 months from now, especially in light of polls 
that show Americans are tired of the subject. ``It will be Bill 
Clinton and his defenders who will pay the price if they bring it 
up,'' said David Carney, a New Hampshire-based GOP consultant. 
</P>
<P>
	Countered Democratic consultant David Axelrod of Chicago: ``It  
may recede some in the next two years, but something like this 
can't recede enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, who bypassed a  
campaign for president to seek the House speaker's chair, says he 
can't predict the impact of impeachment. ``I have no idea,'' he 
said. ``I didn't have any idea the impact it would have on the last 
election until the last few days.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats' prospects may depend most on the success of the  
party's presidential candidate, strategists in both parties say. 
</P>
<P>
	THE SENATE: 19 Republicans are up for election in 2000,  
including 13 from states that Clinton won in 1996. Of those 13, 
only four voted to acquit Clinton of perjury: John Chafee of Rhode 
Island, Slade Gorton of Washington, James Jeffords of Vermont and 
Olympia Snowe of Maine. 
</P>
<P>
	All but Gorton also voted to acquit on the obstruction charge.  
</P>
<P>
	Four GOP senators face a triple threat: They are freshmen, they  
won narrowly in 1994 and Clinton carried their states. Yet all four 
-- Spencer Abraham of Michigan, Mike DeWine of Ohio, Rod Grams of 
Minnesota and Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania -- declared Clinton 
guilty Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those fellows need to get their best toehold, because we're  
coming after them,'' said Michael Tucker, spokesman of the 
Democratic Senate campaign committee. 
</P>
<P>
	``You become what you defend,'' replied GOP spokesman Stuart  
Roy. ``If they're still defending Bill Clinton in an election where 
he's not on the ballot, the Democrats will be in big trouble.'' 
</P>
<P>
	THE WHITE HOUSE: Republicans are betting that their nominee will  
be the new face of the GOP, wiping out memories of impeachment. 
``If Republicans nominate someone who is not from Congress, which 
seems likely, then the impeachment debate will have almost no 
impact on the image of the parties,'' GOP pollster Whit Ayres of 
Atlanta said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Indeed, if the Democratic nominee is Al Gore, I can make an  
argument that he will be the only one affected by the distaste for 
impeachment because his name will be the only one on the tickets 
associated with Bill Clinton or his legacy,'' he added.

<HEADLINE> Slum Built for 'Angela's Ashes' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- When Hollywood decided to make a movie out of  
``Angela's Ashes,'' Frank McCourt's best-selling memoir of his 
poverty-stricken boyhood, the first task was to find a proper Irish 
slum. 
</P>
<P>
	Not so easy in today's more prosperous Ireland, Newsweek says  
its Feb. 22 issue. Unable to find the right sort of grimness in 
Limerick or anywhere else, the filmmakers spent $25 million to 
create it on a vacant lot in Dublin, right down to the tiny family 
kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
	McCourt, who is working on a sequel, called ``'Tis,'' about his  
adult life in America, visited the set for just a few days, but 
found even that a little too real, according to Newsweek. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an abundance of emotions tumbling in. There's sadness and  
nostalgia and wonder and a feeling of removal,'' he said. ``I'm 
jolted into the past and jolted forward into my very successful 
present. It'd be neat if I could have just one emotion, but I 
don't.''

<HEADLINE> Ordonez, Mets Agree to $1.65M Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Shortstop Rey Ordonez got a five-fold salary  
increase Sunday, agreeing with the New York Mets on a $1.65 
million, one-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Ordonez, 27, made $320,000 last season, when he hit .246 with  
one homer and 42 RBIs, winning his second straight NL Gold Glove 
award. 
</P>
<P>
	He was eligible for salary arbitration for the first time and  
had asked for $2,275,000. The Mets had offered $1.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to his base salary, Ordonez could earn $25,000  
bonuses for making the NL All-Star team and winning a Gold Glove. 
</P>
<P>
	He had been scheduled for an arbitration hearing later this  
week. Reliever Armando Benitez is the last Mets player remaining in 
arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, eight players remain in arbitration. Owners have won  
all five hearings thus far.

<HEADLINE> Paper: Customs Service Is Probed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- U.S. Senate and Treasury Department investigators  
have launched nationwide probes into alleged mismanagement in the 
U.S. Customs Service, The Miami Herald reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The investigations are expected to culminate this summer in  
Senate oversight hearings and proposed reforms, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The probes were prompted in part by stories in the Herald that  
reported dozens of examples of employees whose careers flourished 
despite instances of dating drug smugglers, tampering with 
evidence, skimming seized drug cash and having sex with a paid 
informant. 
</P>
<P>
	A Customs investigation found inappropriate leniency in at least  
five cases, the newspaper reported. Customs Commissioner Raymond 
Kelly has begun to make changes, including forced moves of Miami's 
three top administrators. 
</P>
<P>
	A team from the Treasury Department's Office of Inspector  
General is reviewing cases detailed by the Herald. Last week, the 
team told Customs it is expanding the probe to include an audit of 
1997 and 1998 internal affairs case files in El Paso, Texas; New 
Orleans, Philadelphia, Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami and the Customs 
database center in Virginia.

<HEADLINE> 'Daddy' Chant Irks Indiana Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) -- Bob Knight, the king of profane outbursts,  
was offended. 
</P>
<P>
	Chants of ``Who's your daddy?'' got him hot. Or was that  
``Hoosier daddy'' that Northwestern students were directing at the 
Indiana bench? 
</P>
<P>
	Knight didn't care. He just didn't like it.  
</P>
<P>
	So once his Hoosiers won 69-62 in overtime Saturday, he pointed  
to the scoreboard and repeated the same chant to the bleacher 
section nearest the bench, one filled with students and band 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just asked them: `Who's your daddy now?''' Knight said.  
</P>
<P>
	Moments later, Knight angrily confronted Northwestern coach  
Kevin O'Neill at midcourt where coaches usually meet after games. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight lectured O'Neill about the crowd and O'Neill took  
offense. The Wildcats coach grabbed Knight's trademark red warmup 
before Knight ripped his arm away. O'Neill was intercepted by an 
Indiana assistant coach. The whole exchange lasted seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than an hour after the game, Knight and O'Neill cooled off  
and made peace, meeting on a practice court to shake hands and 
talk. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight tried to downplay what happened, choosing to praise  
Northwestern's strong season, O'Neill and center Evan Eschmeyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is great for Northwestern if that end of the floor would  
take a course in English etiquette,'' Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't think it (the crowd) was hostile. I thought it was a  
great environment except for that end. What more could a team ask 
for than the crowd behind them like this one was?'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill professed innocence, saying he didn't know what the  
crowd said and couldn't control it if he did. 
</P>
<P>
	``Crowds get like that,'' O'Neill said. ``I didn't hear  
anything. If our crowd said something out of line, I'd be upset. 
But I don't know what was said.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Who's your daddy?'' is not an uncommon cheer in college  
basketball, although its meanings are open to interpretation. 
</P>
<P>
	Sometimes parentage is involved; sometimes it's a generic  
put-down. Other times, it seems, it can mean whatever the crowd 
wants it to mean. 
</P>
<P>
	And, in the case of Indiana and ``Hoosier daddy,'' there may  
have been some wordplay at work. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanford students chanted it last year at Arizona guard Mike  
Bibby, who had a strained relationship with his father, Henry 
Bibby. 
</P>
<P>
	This season Stanford's student section yelled ``Deadbeat daddy''  
at Connecticut guard Khalid El-Amin, a father. 
</P>
<P>
	At Duke's boisterous Cameron Indoor Stadium, the chant is  
kiddingly aimed at one of its own -- forward Shane Battier, whose 
name gives the chant some lyrical bounce. As in: ``Who's your 
daddy, Battier?'' 
</P>
<P>
	It appears Knight chose to interpret the chant in its most  
literal way. And the Indiana coach insists it has no place in 
college basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``The crowd can get on my butt, they have all things to get on  
my butt about, they'll never run out of them,'' he said. ``But 
that's not the kind of thing that should be part of college 
basketball. The crowd needs to have the same class as the team 
does.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Northwestern's students also chanted ``N-I-T, N-I-T'' at Indiana  
while it was warming up for the second half. There was also the 
chant of ``Head coach, head coach, sit down, sit down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neill, like Knight, can be combustible on the sidelines. He  
dismissed the confrontation as an insignificant run-in done in the 
``heat of battle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He does a great job with his team and he takes a lot of  
unnecessary hits from people,'' O'Neill said of Knight. ``To me it 
was nothing.''

<HEADLINE> Streep Honored by German Film Panel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BERLIN (AP) -- Meryl Streep has received a special award  
symbolizing thanks and respect from the Berlin International Film 
Festival in recognition of her contribution to cinema. 
</P>
<P>
	The small, gilded camera, the Berlinale Kamera, is donated by  
Berlin jeweler David Goldberg and is awarded to actors or actresses 
to whom the festival feels specially bound, in an expression of 
recognition for their achievement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Meryl Streep is one of the most exceptional actresses in the  
international history of film,'' festival organizers said in a 
statement. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Coral a Monument to Broken Heart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOMESTEAD, Fla. (AP) -- It is a valentine made of stone and  
inspired by a broken heart. 
</P>
<P>
	Much larger than any box of chocolate, certainly carrying more  
weight than a greeting card, Florida's Coral Castle stands as a 
monument to unrequited love. 
</P>
<P>
	Recalling a modern-day Stonehenge, the castle was Edward  
Leedskalnin's life work. For more than three decades, he made 
practically everything he needed out of coral rock, the stone 
formed over eons from once-thriving reefs. Sponges and other sea 
life are visible in some of the stones. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is for the love of one woman,'' said Barbara Agramonte,  
who manages the attraction. ``They were to get married and she 
jilted him just before the wedding. She said he wasn't rich 
enough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After being stood up at the altar in 1912 by 16-year-old Agnes  
Scuffs, the 26-year-old Leedskalnin left his native Latvia in 
Eastern Europe for the United States. He contracted tuberculosis 
and was advised (wrongly) that the best place to go was Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1920s, he bought a piece of land for $12 and began  
sculpting. Later he moved to a 10-acre parcel on the edge of the 
Everglades and started the castle in earnest, building a 1,110-ton 
marvel of engineering. Many feel the 5-foot-tall, 100-pound 
Leedskalnin channeled his heartbreak into psychic energy to move 
the gigantic pieces of rock. 
</P>
<P>
	Leedskalnin made everything in his open-air home from the rough  
gray rock: beds, chairs, water wells, a cooking stove. He adorned 
the castle with objects carved from the stone: moons, planets, a 
sundial, a Polaris telescope, and a tower called the Obelisk. A 
coral rock table is in the shape of Florida, with Lake Okeechobee 
represented as a finger bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	A favorite piece among visitors is a 2-ton table in the shape of  
a heart -- listed as the heaviest heart-shaped object in the world 
by the Guinness Book of Records. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was very romantic to do something like this, especially the  
heart-shaped table,'' said Marge Thomas of Gloucester City, N.J. 
``Eccentric, I guess some would call it, maybe a little crazy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Leedskalnin called the love of his life his ``Sweet 16.'' He  
erected a throne for her, a playroom for their make-believe 
children and 16 steps leading up to his sparse bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
	His philosophy is detailed in ``A Book In Every Home,'' in which  
he discussed how all girls must be virgins before marriage and 
mothers should become ``an experimental station'' for young 
lascivious boys. 
</P>
<P>
	``Scary, isn't it?'' Ms. Agramonte said. ``He had very European  
beliefs, very strange beliefs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stranger still is how this man of such small stature built the  
giant castle. Leedskalnin mined the large slabs on site but how he 
moved them into position and fitted them so perfectly remains a 
mystery. 
</P>
<P>
	His tool shack still contains block and tackle and tools  
fashioned from car springs -- but that doesn't explain how a 9-ton 
gate was balanced so perfectly a child can open it with a finger. 
</P>
<P>
	Those interested in psychic phenomena flock to the castle.  
Television shows such as ``In Search Of ...'' have featured the 
attraction. 
</P>
<P>
	Margarita Cisne, a native of Nicaragua, carried the magazine  
named Fate: True Reports of the Strange and Unknown to the castle. 
``I've read a lot of stuff about his place and I really wanted to 
see it,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocking chairs dot the spot where Leedskalnin collected 10 cents  
per tour. When he died of kidney failure in 1951, he was far from 
poor: 35 $100 bills were discovered in a pipe in his bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
	But he was alone.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Scuffs was contacted after his death and asked if she wanted  
to see the castle built just for her. She declined.

<HEADLINE> Poll: US Supports Clinton Acquittal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A majority of Americans think the Senate was  
right to acquit President Clinton of impeachment charges and 
believe Republicans pursued the matter for political reasons, 
according to a Los Angeles Times poll released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty-five percent of those surveyed after Friday's Senate vote  
supported the acquittal, while 30 percent thought Clinton should 
have been removed from office. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were similar to those of polls conducted Friday and  
Saturday by other news organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty-two percent of those surveyed thought Republicans in  
Congress pursued impeachment because they wanted to hurt Clinton 
politically; 34 percent said Republicans were motivated by concern 
for the nation's legal and moral fabric. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-six percent disapproved of the way the Senate handled the  
impeachment trial, and 57 percent said the final debate should have 
been open. 
</P>
<P>
	As with other polls, this one found little support for censuring  
Clinton. Just 38 percent of respondents favored a Senate censure 
resolution, while 47 percent opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone poll of 664 adults nationwide had a margin of  
error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Winfama Wins Feature at Gulfstream </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HALLANDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Winfama, after breaking through the gate  
before the start, returned to her No. 1 post position and proceeded 
to lead all the way in the Suwannee River Handicap at Gulfstream 
Park on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	In a secondary feature, favored Chip caught Noble Robyn in the  
final stride to win the Silvery Honey Stakes for fillies and mares. 
Doubledippindebbie was third. 
</P>
<P>
	After going a mile and an eighth on the grass in the Suwannee  
River event for fillies and mares, Winfama held off Circus Charmer 
by half a length. Colcon, the 9-5 favorite, edged Roberta T. for 
third in a field of eight. 
</P>
<P>
	The winner, ridden by Richard Migliore, was timed in 1:52 1/5  
and paid $13.80, $8 and $4. Circus Charmer paid $9.60 and $5.40. 
Colcon paid $2.80 to show. 
</P>
<P>
	Winfama carried 114 pounds, one more than Circus Charmer and six  
less than topweighted Colcon. The 6-year-old, Florida-bred by Wild 
Again is a Santa Cruz Ranch Inc. homebred. She has won eight of 23 
starts and has been in the money 14 times, with earnings of 
$285,445. She was a double stakes winner last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Silvery Honey Stakes, Chip, ridden by Joe Bravo, ran six  
furlongs in 1:11 and paid $4.40. In third position leaving the 
eighth pole, Chip won by a nose. 
</P>
<P>
	It was her 10th victory and raised her earnings to $448,032. The  
6-year-old daughter of Norquestor swept Gulfstream's major filly 
and mare handicap races in 1997 -- the First Lady, the Shirley Jones 
and the 2 Rampart. Bravo was the rider each time.

	Clinton Begins Summit in Mexico  
</P>
<P>
	MERIDA, Mexico (AP) -- President Clinton began a brief visit to  
Mexico Sunday night to encourage its struggle against narcotics and 
government corruption, and grow its markets for U.S. products. The 
president was accompanied by about a half-dozen members of his 
Cabinet, including retired Gen. Barry McCaffrey, director of the 
White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, and Attorney 
General Janet Reno. The visit comes two weeks before the 
administration must render a formal evaluation of Mexico's 
cooperation in fighting drug trafficking.

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the impeachment trial over, first lady  
Hillary Rodham Clinton will give serious thought to running for the 
Senate from New York next year, senior White House officials said 
Sunday. A number of people ``have been really urging her to run, 
and I think she wants to hear them out,'' White House Chief of 
Staff John Podesta said on ABC. Talk has been circulating for 
several months of prospects that Mrs. Clinton would run for the 
seat to be vacated when Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan leaves the 
Senate in 2000. Moynihan, interviewed on NBC, said ``she'd be 
welcome and she'd win.''

American Episcopal Conference will study how to implement Pope John

	Study: Bulimia Has Basis in Biology  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A new study adds to evidence that the eating  
disorder bulimia springs at least in part from a chemical 
malfunction in the brain and not merely from excessive desire to 
remain thin, researchers say. Researchers found that women who had 
suffered from bulimia and recovered were more affected 
psychologically than other women by being deprived of tryptophan. 
That's an animo acid that plays an indirect role in appetite 
regulation. Researchers say compared with normal women, the 
recovered bulimics reported bigger dips in mood, greater worries 
about body image and more fear of losing control of eating after 
being deprived of dietary tryptophan for about 17 hours.

	DALLAS (AP) -- Enough American Airlines pilots have taken  
themselves off a sick list that American Airlines officials hope to 
be able to resume regular service as early as Tuesday. As of late 
Sunday, ``well under 1,000'' of American's 9,400 pilots were still 
listed as sick, compared to the nearly 2,500 Thursday and Friday 
who declared themselves unfit to fly, an American spokeswoman said. 
However, about 231 flights, or about 10 percent, scheduled for 
Sunday have been canceled because not all of the pilots were 
immediately available for flying.

<HEADLINE> Washington Remembered 200 Yrs Later </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOUNT VERNON, Va. (AP) -- The director of George Washington's  
home got blank looks from children recently when he mentioned the 
story about a young George cutting down his father's favorite 
cherry tree, then fessing up. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't know the myths,'' said Mount Vernon director James  
Rees said. ``I couldn't believe it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the 200th anniversary of the death of America's first  
president coming up, a group hopes to raise Washington's profile 
and make him a role model again. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting Monday, on the holiday that used to be Washington's  
own, the Mount Vernon Ladies' Association will begin a 
commemoration of his Dec. 14, 1799, death all year long. The 
association, which bought Washington's home in 1858 and has tended 
it ever since, is devoting $3 million to the effort. 
</P>
<P>
	A funeral tour will be given three times a day. A black-ribboned  
theater will offer a multimedia presentation of Washington's final 
day. In December, the funeral will be recreated, including the 
three days that the coffin was kept in the dining room. 
</P>
<P>
	The ladies' association also has sent out the first road show of  
``Treasures from Mount Vernon,'' making five stops around the 
country. At a refurbished Mount Vernon museum, visitors will see a 
restored terra cotta bust sculpted from life by Jean-Antoine 
Houdon. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a great product,'' said Mount Vernon spokeswoman Sally  
McDonough. 
</P>
<P>
	But the hoopla is about more than marketing, Rees said.  
</P>
<P>
	Rees noticed Washington's status was slipping when he compared a  
history book from his school days with a contemporary textbook from 
the same Richmond school. Space devoted to the father of the 
country dropped from 10 pages to less than one. 
</P>
<P>
	Even when Washington was more actively emulated, he seemed  
distant, said biographer Richard Norton Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not as quotable as Jefferson, he's not as audacious as  
Hamilton, he's not as learned as Madison and not as wry as 
Franklin,'' said the author of ``Patriarch: George Washington and 
the New American Nation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rees said even people who like Washington are a little bored by  
him, not realizing that he liked to gamble, dance and horseback 
ride and that he had a distillery at Mount Vernon. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a really exciting guy,'' Rees said.

<HEADLINE> Museum Asked to Return Space Parts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HUNTSVILLE, Ala. (AP) -- A contractor for NASA has asked the U.S.  
Space and Rocket Center museum to return exhibit parts for future 
shuttle launches. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing a lack of parts and funding, Marshall Space Flight Center  
and United Space Alliance asked the center last week to return 
forward assemblies from the solid rocket boosters on the museum's 
full-size shuttle exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't have thought we would have given flight-ready  
hardware,'' Lynne Lowery, community affairs manager at Marshall, 
told Sunday's Huntsville Times. 
</P>
<P>
	The segmented rocket boosters are the largest solid propellant  
motors ever flown, at 149 feet in length and 12 feet in diameter. 
After a shuttle launch, the boosters are designed to separate at 
220,000 feet and parachute back to the ocean. They are recovered 
and refurbished for future flights. 
</P>
<P>
	The forward assembly contains the booster's jettison rockets,  
electronics, recovery parachutes and self-destruct system, among 
other flight instrumentation. 
</P>
<P>
	John Chapman, deputy solid rocket booster project manager at  
Marshall, said the assemblies were designed for repeated use, but 
several have been damaged or lost since the U.S. shuttle program 
began in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would hope folks say the shuttle program is trying to be as  
cost-effective as possible to continue to fly the program,'' 
Chapman said. 
</P>
<P>
	He estimated it would cost about $300,000 for a crane to lower  
the museum's boosters to the ground, remove the forward assemblies, 
restore them to flight-ready condition and build nonflight mockups 
for use in the museum exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
	But it would take three years and cost between $5 million and  
$10 million to find a manufacturer and build new forward 
assemblies. And the Clinton administration's fiscal 2000 request 
for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration represents a 
decline for the fifth straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't just wait until we have a problem and go order some  
more,'' he said. ``We've got to get out in front of the problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The work at the museum will begin next week and the mockups  
should be in place by March 15, said museum spokesman Edd Davis.

<HEADLINE> Daytona 500 Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Rusty Wallace was in position to win  
his first Daytona 500 on Sunday. Then Bobby Hamilton crashed and 
the yellow flag came out. 
</P>
<P>
	Suddenly, it was decision time.  
</P>
<P>
	Crew chief Robin Pemberton decided to keep Wallace on the track  
during the caution period, figuring his driver would have enough 
fuel and his tires would hold out long enough to win the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Jeff Gordon and Dale Earnhardt stopped for new tires.  
Gordon and Earnhardt finished 1-2. Wallace got left in their tracks 
and came in eighth. 
</P>
<P>
	``We thought the decision was OK,'' said Wallace, maybe the best  
driver on the Winston Cup circuit yet to win NASCAR's premier race. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still think the decision was fine. Looking back on it right  
now, maybe if I would have had a little more grip in the tires, I 
might have been able to hold that bottom line a bit better. But the 
car still handled good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During the caution period, Pemberton said on television that  
Wallace could just as easily face trouble and lose his lead in the 
crowded pit area as on the track. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a calculated gamble. One that didn't pay off.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know why he didn't get tires,'' Earnhardt said. ``It  
might not have been the tires. But I think tires played a big part 
in Jeff winning the race and me finishing second.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Gordon crew chief Ray Evernham: ``That's a tough decision  
for Robin to make. If your car is doing good and you're leading the 
race, it's tough to make that call. We were fifth at the time, so 
it wasn't a big decision.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	JARRETT JOSTLED: Dale Jarrett climbed out of his battered car,  
walked toward the wrecker and shrugged as he approached Terry 
Labonte. 
</P>
<P>
	``What happened? Was it my fault?'' Jarrett asked.  
</P>
<P>
	That question may never be completely resolved.  
</P>
<P>
	After racing in the top three through more than half of the  
race, Jarrett's day ended when he was involved in a 13-car accident 
that concluded with himself, Labonte, Mark Martin and several 
others out of contention. 
</P>
<P>
	At first glance, it appeared he had been nudged by teammate  
Kenny Irwin. But several replays indicated Jarrett simply lost 
speed while bogged down in traffic. He wasn't able to tuck in line 
ahead of Irwin's car, which was bearing down in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know,'' Jarrett said. ``I got tagged going into (turn)  
three. I pushed up coming out of two and they got a run on me. I 
was just trying to go into three and somebody hit me in the left 
rear. It all started from there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As he slid toward the inside, Jarrett took contact from Labonte,  
who sent him spinning across the track, into the path of about 10 
cars. Then he was tagged by another car, sending him skidding back 
toward the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
	Irwin, a second year driver who considers Jarrett something of a  
mentor, said he was trying to let Jarrett back in line. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if we actually touched, or if the air just got  
off his spoiler and he spun,'' said Irwin, who avoided the crash 
and went on to finish third. ``I have no idea, but I feel very, 
very bad about it if it was my fault.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	WHO IS THIS GUY: So far in his career, Mike Skinner has been  
best known for winning a pair of poles at Daytona in 1997 and 
switching crew chiefs with teammate Earnhardt last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, on Sunday he showed he may be a major factor on the  
Winston Cup circuit this season. 
</P>
<P>
	With Earnhardt's former chief, Larry McReynolds, at the helm,  
Skinner ran in the top five virtually all day and finished in 
fourth place. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a promising start to the season after an injury-plagued  
1998 left him in 21st place on the points list. He had been as low 
as 40th before McReynolds came on and helped spark a late-season 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
	The momentum continued into the Daytona 500.  
</P>
<P>
	``I really appreciate Larry McReynolds making brilliant calls  
all day for us,'' Skinner said. ``And those guys going over the 
wall were awesome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His only regret was not being able to sneak up from fourth to  
third place to try to give Earnhardt a boost down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have much rather been behind that black 3,'' Skinner  
said. ``The way circumstances were, it wasn't meant to be that way 
today. Maybe it will be at Talladega,'' in April, which is when the 
next restrictor-plate race takes place. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	I OBJECT: Mike Helton, who last week took over day-to-day  
control of NASCAR from longtime president Bill France, introduced 
Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas at the prerace drivers' 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like you to meet a member of the highest court in the  
land,'' Helton told the drivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, grinning, the new chief operating officer of NASCAR added,  
``Well, he's not Bill France, so maybe it's the second-highest 
court in the land.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas served as grand marshal and gave the traditional command:  
``Gentlemen, start your engines.''

	NO MILLIONAIRES HERE: Gordon earned a $1 million No Bull 5 bonus  
by following a top-five finish at Talladega Superspeedway last 
October with a victory at Daytona. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the promotion, the name of one fan was drawn and  
paired with each of the top five finishers from Talladega. Ray 
Grimm of Hagerstown, Md., was the lucky fan paired with Jordan and 
he also won $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
	But -- one snag -- he had made a deal with the other four  
contestants to split the $1 million evenly. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's true,'' he said. ``It's a pact I made and I'm going to  
keep it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It still made for some pretty exciting moments for Grimm, a  
correctional officer who had been a big Earnhardt fan until this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't really describe how I felt,'' he said. ``It was so  
tense. I really couldn't see the whole race from where I was 
sitting. Until I heard he had come over the finish line, I just 
couldn't stand it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon has now collected the $1 million bonus from series  
sponsor Winston four times, including the 1997 Southern 500 and 
last year's Brickyard 400 and Southern 500. 
</P>
<P>
	His total payoff of $2,172,246 on Sunday is the biggest in auto  
racing history, breaking his own mark of $1,637,625 in the 
Brickyard. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	PIT STOPS: Rookie Tony Stewart joined A.J. Foyt as only the  
second racer to start in the front row at the Daytona 500 and the 
Indy 500. Stewart dropped out of contention early and finished 
28th. ... Dave Marcis competed in his 32nd straight Daytona 500. He 
finished 16th. Terry Labonte made his record 603rd consecutive 
Winston Cup start and finished 38th. ... Bobby Labonte led 20 of 
the first 50 laps, but fell back because of engine troubles and 
finished 25th.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Might Run for NY Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A possible race between Hillary Rodham Clinton  
and New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for a Senate seat in 2000 would 
be a ``titanic struggle,'' one Republican senator says. 
</P>
<P>
	White House aides said Sunday that with President Clinton's  
impeachment trial over, the first lady will now sit down with those 
who want her to consider a run for the Senate from New York next 
year to replace fellow Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's going to talk to the people who have been urging her to  
run, think about it. But I will tell you one thing: I think that if 
she does run, she will win,'' White House chief of staff John 
Podesta said on ABC's ``This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``People in Washington are just catching on to something that  
people know all over the country,'' White House communications 
director Ann Lewis said on CNN's ``Late Edition,'' praising the 
first lady's grasp of health care and other issues. ``There are a 
lot of people in New York who think she would be a great senator 
and are very excited about the prospect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton's backers have for months been floating the idea of  
her making a run for the seat that Moynihan is surrendering after 
24 years. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Republican side, Giuliani, who has made no formal  
announcement of his intentions, is considered a leading potential 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	``That would make this a titanic struggle of two very popular  
figures,'' Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who is in charge of 
fund-raising for Republican senatorial candidates, told CNN. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it would be an incredible race. It might be one of the  
great races in history, Giuliani vs. Mrs. Clinton,'' Sen. John 
McCain, R-Ariz., said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moynihan, also on NBC, welcomed Mrs. Clinton as a candidate and  
predicted she would win. He said New York could probably use some 
of her ``magnificent, young, bright, able, Illinois-Arkansas 
enthusiasm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She would probably have a clear field if she decided to run,  
Moynihan said, although political life in New York ``can get a 
little rough on the frontiers.'' Rep. Nita Lowey is among the 
Democrats already mentioned as possible candidates. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is ``going to be very deliberative about this. This  
is going to be a major life change,'' said Democratic Sen. Frank 
Lautenberg from neighboring New Jersey. ``I think she would be one 
terrific candidate,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is expected to be very much in the public eye now  
that the Senate has acquitted the president of perjury and 
obstruction of justice charges. She plans to travel nationwide 
promoting her husband's Social Security and Medicare proposals, 
make another ``spring break'' mission overseas, probably with 
daughter Chelsea; and take her ``America's treasures'' tour to the 
West to promote historic preservation.

<HEADLINE> Chase May Take Over Part of Toyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Chase Manhattan Bank will take over part of the  
securities operations of Toyo Trust and Banking Co., marking the 
Japanese trust bank's complete withdrawal from overseas business, a 
newspaper reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyo Trust, Japan's fifth largest trust bank, has agreed to  
transfer its overseas securities custodian operations -- the 
business of holding and managing stocks and bonds -- to the U.S. 
bank, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun said. 
</P>
<P>
	The trust bank has already decided to move its loan and other  
overseas business to Japan's Sanwa Bank, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyo Trust is one of many Japanese banks requesting money from a  
public fund created last year to strengthen the ailing financial 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's Financial Restructuring Committee has asked the  
banks to carry out drastic reforms, and some banks have reportedly 
been urged to restrict their activities to the domestic market. 
</P>
<P>
	In its deal with Chase Manhattan, Toyo Trust will also undertake  
administrative operations for the U.S. bank's investment trust 
business in Japan, the Nihon Keizai said. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyo Trust officials were unavailable for comment on Sunday.

<HEADLINE> School Cancels Ethnic Festivities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- A high school is scrapping celebrations  
of Black History Month and Cinco de Mayo, worried that the ethnic 
celebrations will spark ethnic violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Inglewood High School, 10 miles south of downtown Los Angeles,  
has been the site of tensions between black and Hispanic students. 
The campus was forced to close for a day last May after a riot 
broke out and dozens of police were called in. 
</P>
<P>
	A task force found that the fight in May began, in part, because  
Hispanic students who comprise about half the school population 
felt slighted. They were angry that a month was set aside to honor 
black history but only a day to celebrate Cinco de Mayo. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of celebrating Black History Month and Cinco de Mayo,  
Principal Lowell Winston has told teachers to follow a 
``multicultural education approach'' throughout the school year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's talk about all cultures and contributions all the  
time,'' Winston said. ``This school has had racial problems that 
are unique ... the old ways didn't work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	February is marked by many schools around the country as Black  
History Month. May 5 is a national holiday in Mexico commemorating 
an 1862 battle in which Mexico defeated French occupation troops 
southeast of Mexico City.

<HEADLINE> China Won't Devalue Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin says he is  
confident that China will not devalue its currency despite pressure 
to do so, Time magazine reports in its latest issue. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview that took place week, Jiang was quoted as saying  
that the Chinese currency will ``stay stable'' although a 
devaluation of the yuan would boost the country's exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Asian countries have devalued their currencies because of  
the regional economic crisis, making Chinese goods more expensive. 
But despite the pressure and rumors of a yuan devaluation that have 
occasionally rattled Asian markets, Beijing has said repeatedly 
that it wants to keep the Chinese currency stable. 
</P>
<P>
	Jiang also complained that the United States wants to sell China  
products Beijing doesn't need while restricting sales of some 
things it wants to buy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Chinese are very smart. On our own, we developed the  
hydrogen and atomic bombs,'' the Chinese leader was quoted as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Jiang said that if Washington refuses to ``sell us satellites  
and other new high-tech products, we may be able to develop them by 
ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese officials have repeatedly called on the United States to  
lift restrictions on high-tech sales to China, saying such sales 
could help redress the surging U.S. trade deficit with China.

<HEADLINE> Browns Jump Into Free Agent Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- The Cleveland Browns jumped into the NFL's free  
agent market Sunday, signing center Dave Wohlabaugh and punter 
Chris Gardocki. 
</P>
<P>
	The expansion Browns, with about $30 million available for  
possible signings, are expected to be extremely active in luring 
free agents to fill out the roster. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms were not disclosed, but Wohlabaugh was seeking the richest  
contract ever for a center, using Kevin Mawae's five-year, S16.5 
million contract with the New York Jets a target. 
</P>
<P>
	Dwight Clark, head of football operations for the expansion  
Browns, said Sunday that Wolhobaugh was high on the Browns' 
most-wanted list. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was our coaches' opinion that a center is vital to a good  
running game,'' Clark said. ``His ability on tape showed up very 
well. So we decided to make that a priority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 26-year-old Wohlabaugh, 6-foot-3 and 292 pounds, became a  
starter with the New England Patriots in the sixth game of his 
rookie season in 1995 and has started every game since. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Pyne, center for the Detroit Lions last season, was the  
first player chosen by the Browns last week in the expansion draft. 
Pyne is also experienced at guard. 
</P>
<P>
	Gardocki, 29, an eight-year NFL veteran, averaged 45.4 yards in  
79 punts for the Indianapolis Colts last season. He was selected to 
the Pro Bowl in the 1995 and 1996 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Gardocki has never had a punt blocked. He also handled kickoffs  
for the Colts. 
</P>
<P>
	Gardocki's signing came after Tom Tupa, a former Browns player  
who was the punter for the New England Patriots last season, signed 
with the New York Jets. Tupa had considered the Browns, but said he 
wanted to play for Bill Parcells and for a team he thinks has a 
good chance to get to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns selected 37 players, most of them young and with  
inexpensive contracts, last week in the league's expansion draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the Browns are believed to have gone into the free  
agent signing period nearly $40 million under the league's mandated 
salary cap, some of that will have to be applied to signing draft 
picks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns will have the first pick in the NFL draft in April.  
</P>
<P>
	The Browns have also acquired tight end Irv Smith and defensive  
end Roy Barker from the San Francisco 49ers, who are trying to 
clear some cap space, for taking cornerback Antonio Langham and his 
huge contract in Tuesday's expansion draft.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Critics Don't Give Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOUNTAIN BROOK, Ala. (AP) -- While many Americans are ready for a  
time of healing now that President Clinton's impeachment trial is 
over, Walter Perry and his friends are not. Their feelings run too 
deep for anything but anger. 
</P>
<P>
	They gather daily outside a small bookstore in a quaint cluster  
of shops with English Tudor styling in this old-money town. Here, 
Republican politics are as firmly rooted as the towering oaks that 
shade the mansions of the doctors, lawyers and CEOs who work in 
nearby Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry and his friends smoke fine cigars, hobnob with passers-by  
and talk politics. 
</P>
<P>
	``He slicked his way out,'' said Perry, 72, smoke from a fat  
stogie meandering through his gray beard. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry, a retired attorney and former state legislator, is a  
proud part of the unwavering one-third of Americans who showed up 
in polls for months supporting Clinton's removal from office. The 
Senate verdict did nothing to change their opinions. 
</P>
<P>
	Perry and most of his mindset are conservative white  
Republicans, with above-average income, polls show. That's an 
almost perfect description of Mountain Brook, where nearly all the 
black faces belong to yard men or maids. 
</P>
<P>
	These people aren't the blue-collar workers who helped launch  
former Gov. George Wallace in his segregationist years. Not all are 
conservative; many are business-minded moderates with a sense of 
civic duty to majority-black Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
	Even the playground grass is lush at their schools, among the  
best anywhere. Their forested neighborhoods grew into a Republican 
seedbed over the past three decades by an exodus of whites leaving 
Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
	Now that the trial is over and Clinton is on the road to  
finishing his final two years in office, his harshest critics are 
left to figure out where to go next. 
</P>
<P>
	Neal Anderson III, who sells ``Impeach Clinton'' and ``Impeach  
Hillary'' buttons over the Internet, has a hard time explaining 
exactly what it is about the president that riles him. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not all the women, and it's not his social agenda. It's  
something deeper, something words cannot explain. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's everything,'' Anderson, 36, said with a frustrated shrug,  
sitting across the round table from Perry. 
</P>
<P>
	Eunie Smith isn't part of the coffee club, but she's known to  
its members. As the longtime head of Eagle Forum in Alabama, she 
has campaigned against Clinton and his policies for years. 
</P>
<P>
	Stately and proud, Mrs. Smith is particularly put out with Sen.  
Richard Shelby of Alabama, one of the first Republicans to break 
ranks and cast doubt on the case laid out by GOP House managers. He 
voted not guilty on the perjury count, and guilty on obstruction. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a very sad commentary on our country and the value  
systems we are expressing by leaving him in office. It's amoral and 
immoral,'' said Mrs. Smith, widow of one-term U.S. Rep. Albert Lee 
Smith, who served in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't long ago that Alabama was a solidly Democratic state,  
but that changed in the last two decades. Bob Dole won Alabama over 
Clinton in 1996, continuing a string of Republican wins in the 
state since Democrat Jimmy Carter carried it in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
	At Mountain Brook Elementary School, Dole received 87 percent of  
the vote over Clinton two years ago. By comparison, a statewide 
exit poll taken in the November election showed nearly two-thirds 
of Alabama's voters opposed impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Those numbers don't make sense to Navy veteran Saunders Jones, a  
retired manufacturing executive who seethes with hatred of Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones looks at the president and sees a void where moral  
conviction should be. Although an active volunteer for the Alabama 
GOP, he has an unprintable curse for the Republican senators who 
voted to acquit Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look on the Republicans as being the last defense against  
America becoming a socialist backwater,'' said Jones, 73. 
</P>
<P>
	Back on the sidewalk, Perry and his friends can't decide exactly  
what happened to torpedo the GOP case in the Senate. The best hope 
for the future is electing a Republican in 2000, they agree. 
</P>
<P>
	But one thing is clear: This band of critics does not understand  
what most Americans are thinking in supporting Clinton. ``He has 
patently lied,'' said Perry.

<HEADLINE> Gebrselassie Sets 15th World Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BIRMINGHAM, England (AP) -- While Gail Devers shrugged off the  
agonies of the recent past, Haile Gebrselassie overcame what was 
right in front of him. 
</P>
<P>
	Devers came through her first major race in nine months with the  
fastest 60-meter time of the year on Sunday while Gebrselassie 
posted his 15th world record after battling past three slower 
runners who wouldn't get out of his way. 
</P>
<P>
	Devers and Gebrselassie went to the BUPA Grand Prix meet with  
starkly contrasting recent histories. 
</P>
<P>
	Gebrselassie had cemented his position as the world's top 5,000  
and 10,000-meter runner with world record performances while 
two-time Olympic 100-meter champion Devers remained sidelined month 
after month after Achilles tendon problems that needed surgery. 
</P>
<P>
	At the National Indoor Arena, the Ethiopian star was after the  
indoor 5,000 meter record owned by Daniel Komen, and was falling 
behind schedule by the time that his two pacemakers had dropped 
out. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gebrselassie got back onto world record pace and then came  
to the final bend when he found three lapped runners ahead of him 
in a bunch. 
</P>
<P>
	``They didn't run on the first lane or the outside lane, they  
were in all three. I was scared,'' the Ethiopian said. ``Those 
three guys killed almost a second.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gebrselassie managed to pass all three and ran flat out for the  
final 50 meters. He crossed the finish line in 12 minutes 50.38 
seconds to trim 1.10 off Komen's world mark. 
</P>
<P>
	Devers raced away from the field to win the 60-meters dash in  
7.04, the fastest time of the year by .19. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy to get through that and that I'm healthy,'' the 1992  
and 1996 Olympic 100-meter champion said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't run for eons and I'm very excited to be here and  
winning. Now I can run some more indoor races and get ready for the 
outdoor season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Devers finished a half-meter ahead of Sevatheda Fynes of the  
Bahamas. Devers will run at Gent in Belgium on Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> Miller Finishes 8th in Slalom Event </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- Youthful exuberance gave way to a veteran's  
savvy on Sunday for Bode Miller. The result: An eighth-place finish 
in the men's slalom, the final event of the World Alpine Ski 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller started 30th and placed 13th in the first run, then  
improved five spots in the afternoon. His time of 1 minute, 42.94 
seconds was .69 seconds shy of a spot on the podium and .82 behind 
winner Kalle Palander of Finland. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, 21, of Franconia, N.H., positioned himself for a fast  
second run by thinking his way down a nasty first-run course. 
</P>
<P>
	``I try to plan but sometimes it just plain doesn't work. It's a  
matter of whether you have the mind strength to stick to your plan 
once you get on the course,'' he said. ``It's easy to hear everyone 
yelling from the side and get caught up in it and really start 
attacking 100 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such racers as Olympic champion Hans-Petter Buraas and 1997  
world champion Tom Stiansen, both of Norway, fell victim to a gate 
set on a patch of ice at the top of Pepi's Face, where the course 
plummets into the finish area. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller saw that gate during a pre-race inspection and was  
determined it wouldn't get him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today, I was lucky,'' Miller said. ``It was really apparent  
where you had to do that. It's mostly only that one spot so I made 
sure I did it. I felt like it was really important to get down the 
first run and give myself a good position for the second run. 
</P>
<P>
	``You had to slow down. ... The gate is right on the breakover  
and the ice is hard as any rink. There's not a chatter mark on it. 
I ditched a lot of speed right before it and got out and away and 
cut straight over so I went straight across the ice rather than try 
to turn on it. That was my plan. Then I attacked the pitch after 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The strategy paid off in a 13th-place finish in the first run  
that gave him the No. 3 starting spot in the afternoon. On a course 
set straighter than in the morning, Miller rocked all the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I moved into the first group in the first run, that was  
when I knew I had a good chance at it,'' he said. ``I was really 
nervous at the start. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right out of the start, I skied my best. Then right away I  
ditched some speed, which was a real bummer because I had all this 
speed and for some reason I just dug in'' the edge of his ski. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite losing some time with that mistake, he handled Pepi's  
Face well and pronounced himself satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is my first world championships and I'm very proud of  
it,'' he said. ``I've got to give credit to those guys who beat me 
the second run. I mean, they were skiing well. It was a challenging 
course and the speeds were really high. You had to have your head 
right where it needs to be.''

<HEADLINE> Italy Telecom-Murdoch Talks Ended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Telecom Italia and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. have  
broken off negotiations for sale of a large stake in Telecom's pay 
TV channel. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both companies agreed this morning to interrupt negotiations  
for various reasons,'' said Alberto Brunelli, a spokesman for 
Telecom Italia on Saturday, 
</P>
<P>
	He did not elaborate, but RAI state TV indicated Murdoch's side  
was irritated by a recent Italian government decree putting limits 
on the percentage of rights to pay TV broadcasting of major league 
soccer games. 
</P>
<P>
	Later in the day, the Italian news agency AGI quoted an  
unidentified News Corp. official as saying the group was still 
interested in the Italian market and wanted to explore the 
possibility of reopening the negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, Murdoch reached a preliminary agreement with  
Telecom Italia to buy 80 percent of its pay TV unit Stream. The 
agreement was the subject of debate in Italy as some in the 
government and media have argued against foreign ownership of the 
pay TV industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Murdoch's side had been mainly attracted to the deal as a way to  
secure sweeping soccer TV rights. 
</P>
<P>
	Stream now has only about 120,000 subscribers, and News Corp.  
was hoping to attract many, many more with soccer broadcast rights. 
</P>
<P>
	RAI reported that Telecom was open to possible deals with U.S.  
or other European companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's other and dominant pay TV provider is Telepiu, which is  
controlled by France's Canal Plus SA.

<HEADLINE> Diallo's Body Flown to Guinea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Thousands of people in everything from trucks,  
taxis, beat-up cars and shiny Mercedes Benzes gathered Sunday in a 
sendoff to a West African immigrant whose death at the hands of 
police has outraged the black community. 
</P>
<P>
	A motorcade of somber supporters assembled outside the  
headquarters of the Rev. Al Sharpton's National Action Network in 
Harlem and accompanied Amadou Diallo's family to Newark 
International Airport as they prepared to fly his body home to 
Guinea for burial. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was in the midst of all this pain, a beautiful sight to see  
all these brothers and sisters driving down the highway,'' said 
Sharpton, who was to accompany the family to Africa. ``As we go to 
Guinea we must continue the struggle for justice here. ... This 
cannot be the end, but the beginning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four plainclothes police officers fired 41 bullets at Amadou  
Diallo, 22, as he stood in the vestibule of his apartment house in 
the Bronx on Feb. 4. Many have questioned why so many shots were 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
	An attorney for the officers has said that police thought he was  
armed. At the time, the officers were searching for a rapist, who 
is still at large. 
</P>
<P>
	The shooting is being investigated by the Bronx district  
attorney's office with the assistance of the FBI. The officers have 
been placed on administrative non-enforcement duty. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, many of the thousands who took part in the motorcade  
said they were trying to prevent another killing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am doing this so they don't shoot any more of our people,''  
said a taxi driver who identified herself only as Fatima. ``If we 
didn't protest certain things, we'd still have no civil rights, no 
human rights.''

<HEADLINE> Book: E-Mail Started Lewinsky Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A coming book suggests Hillary Rodham Clinton  
may have had it half right when she complained about a ``vast 
right-wing conspiracy'' against her husband. Clinton's foes weren't 
vast, the book says, but they were conservative and persistent in 
trying to bring him down. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsweek reporter Michael Isikoff, who helped break the story  
that would lead to only the second presidential impeachment, says a 
``handful of determined enemies'' worked to undermine President 
Clinton and get the explosive Monica Lewinsky tapes to the special 
prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	Isikoff's book, ``Uncovering Clinton: A Reporter's Story,'' is  
to be published in April. An article adapted from the book is 
published in Newsweek's Feb. 22 issue, on newsstands Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The article identifies ``conspirators'' who are either familiar  
players in the Lewinsky saga or have been reported previously as 
working back channels. 
</P>
<P>
	But it offers new detail on the Lewinsky story, from the time it  
dropped into the laps of a loose band of lawyers and others 
involved in the Paula Jones case in November 1997 to the night in 
January 1998 when Linda Tripp disclosed her friend's relationship 
with Clinton to the independent counsel's office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although the conspirators were conservative, they were not the  
'vast' group that Hillary Clinton suspected,'' Isikoff writes. 
``Instead, they were a handful of determined enemies of the 
president who not only helped the Jones camp but also led a willing 
Linda Tripp to Kenneth Starr.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the book, when New York literary agent Lucianne  
Goldberg wanted to air her friend Mrs. Tripp's claims, she first 
called conservative publisher Alfred Regnery, who gave her the 
phone number of Chicago banker Peter Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who has underwritten anti-Clinton publicity, put her in  
touch with Richard Porter, an associate at the Chicago law firm 
where Starr bases his private practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after, Isikoff says, an electronic mail message from Porter  
arrived on the computer screen of New York lawyer George Conway, 
who had been quietly helping the Jones attorneys. It said: 
``There's a woman named Lewisky (sic). She indulges a certain 
Lothario in the Casa Blanca for oral sex in the pantry.'' Casa 
Blanca is Spanish for White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The e-mail also mentioned ``romantic tapes.'' Mrs. Tripp's  
secret tape recordings of her conversations with Ms. Lewinsky were 
central in the impeachment trial that ended Friday with Clinton's 
acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp was soon talking directly to the lawyers in Mrs.  
Jones' sexual harassment suit against the president, and a month 
later she and Ms. Lewinsky were subpoenaed by them. Isikoff writes 
that Mrs. Tripp was willing to testify but told lawyers ``I need to 
look hostile'' about being called to give evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The book says Ms. Goldberg got a call from Mrs. Tripp on Dec.  
23, 1997, and wrote in her notebook: ``Linda told 'pretty girl' she 
would not lie'' under oath. 
</P>
<P>
	The tip about Ms. Lewinsky made it to Starr's office via another  
circuitous route -- a Philadelphia dinner that an associate of the 
Jones lawyers had with a Starr associate. The tip was passed on to 
Jackie Bennett, Starr's right-hand man, who said that if Mrs. Tripp 
had information, she should give it to prosecutors directly. 
</P>
<P>
	Three days later Bennett was on the phone with Mrs. Tripp and,  
on Jan. 17, 1998, Clinton testified in the Jones case. Caught 
off-guard by detailed questions about Ms. Lewinsky, he denied under 
oath that they had ``sexual relations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Isikoff, the first reporter to hear the Tripp tapes, writes that  
he turned down an early offer to let him hear them. ``I did not 
want to be a part of whatever they were up to,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Spread Fame Around </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The yearlong Monica Lewinsky saga thrust the  
proverbial 15 minutes of fame upon a cast of ordinary people. Some 
relished the limelight, while others grudgingly lost the comforts 
of their anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	White House steward Bayani Nelvis and Oval Office secretary  
Betty Currie looked uneasy when hordes of photographers and 
cameramen surrounded them as they walked into the federal 
courthouse to testify before Kenneth Starr's grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Several White House aides ran up huge legal bills. Catherine  
Allday Davis, a high school friend of Ms. Lewinsky, had to fly all 
the way from Japan to testify. Larry Cockell, the tall, stern 
Secret Service agent who stands beside the president in public, was 
temporarily removed as his chief bodyguard during the legal battle 
over his grand jury testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	And Andrew Bleiler, a Portland, Ore., theater technician, lost  
his marriage over his admission of a five-year affair with Ms. 
Lewinsky. He separated from his wife and plans to divorce. 
</P>
<P>
	But for every figure who counted a personal loss in the  
presidential scandal, another seemed to flourish. 
</P>
<P>
	Book agent Lucianne Goldberg, who encouraged Linda Tripp to make  
the secret tapes that divulged Ms. Lewinsky's affair with President 
Clinton, savored her fame. ``We wanted to be at the center of it,'' 
she told a magazine interviewer. 
</P>
<P>
	A frequent television guest, Goldberg will try to keep her  
profile high with a new radio talk show. But her son, Jonah, who 
used to get 25 to 30 interview requests a week, now gets few. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went through my five minutes of withdrawal after my 15  
minutes of fame was up,'' said Jonah Goldberg, a writer and 
television producer. 
</P>
<P>
	Internet gossip columnist Matt Drudge, first to report  
allegations of the Lewinsky-Clinton affair, parlayed his sudden 
fame into his own 30-minute weekly TV show on the Fox network. 
</P>
<P>
	William Ginsburg, the garrulous California malpractice attorney  
who first represented Ms. Lewinsky, became a ubiquitous presence on 
TV talk shows -- once appearing on five in a single day. But the 
spotlight quickly faded after he was replaced last April by two 
Washington-savvy lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	And Abe Hirschfeld, an eccentric New York real estate magnate,  
invited the cameras to him. At a news conference he offered Paula 
Jones $1 million to settle her sexual harassment lawsuit against 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	But most will now recede into distant memories of a tawdry  
presidential scandal that most Americans could not wait to end. As 
artist Andy Warhol predicted, anyone can be famous, but not for 
very long. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's all going to fade, and no one will remember who these  
people were,'' said Thomas Sokolowski, director of The Andy Warhol 
Museum in Pittsburgh.

<HEADLINE> Italy Telecom-Murdoch Talks Ended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- Telecom Italia and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. have  
broken off negotiations for sale of a large stake in Telecom's pay 
TV channel. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Heads for Mexico Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a quick pivot from impeachment, President  
Clinton headed for Mexico on Sunday for a quick summit to encourage 
more progress in its difficult struggle against illegal drugs and 
government corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days after his acquittal by the Senate, Clinton was to meet  
with President Ernesto Zedillo at Merida in the Yucatan peninsula, 
a popular tourist destination. 
</P>
<P>
	The visit -- 23 hours from landing to takeoff -- comes two weeks  
before the administration must render a formal evaluation of 
Mexico's cooperation in fighting drug trafficking. Clinton and 
Zedillo have met about every six months over the last few years, 
and officials say this meeting is intended simply to maintain good 
relations. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after Air Force One was airborne, Clinton and first lady  
Hillary Rodham Clinton appeared in the press cabin of the plane 
passing out chocolate candy from a huge heart-shaped box. 
</P>
<P>
	``Happy Valentines Day,'' the president said. ``Isn't this the  
biggest heart you ever saw in your life? This is a better kind of 
heart of darkness.'' He did not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton was wearing a gold-colored, heart-shaped pin on her  
dark suit. Asked whether it was new, she replied, ``Brand new.'' 
She then pointed to her husband and smiled. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton said the box of candy was a gift from one of her  
brothers. The first couple moved quickly through the press cabin, 
distributing candy to passengers in other parts of the plane as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and Zedillo are expected to discuss immigration and  
complete an agreement on border safety and curbing border violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico could be hit with tough economic sanctions if it receives  
a failing grade in the drug battle. While the administration says 
Mexico has a tremendous drug problem, it is believed likely Clinton 
will certify Mexico as a cooperative ally in fighting narcotics, as 
it has been in all 12 years since the congressionally mandated 
review process began. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before Clinton's trip, the administration appeared to be  
laying groundwork for a positive report while acknowledging that 
cocaine seizures by the Mexican police have dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	``President Zedillo is clearly trying to establish a clean  
government and respect for the rule of law,'' Sandy Berger, the 
president's national security adviser, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Mexico is confronting its problem of government  
corruption ``with remarkable candor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Indeed, much of what we know and much of what troubles us  
about the extent of corruption in the Mexican law-enforcement 
effort has emerged from Mexico's own efforts to uproot it,'' Berger 
said. ``And that's something we need to acknowledge and 
encourage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	James Dobbins, the National Security Council's senior director  
for InterAmerican Affairs, said, ``We think we've made a lot of 
progress over the last year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico blames the United States for much of its drug problem,  
because Americans are the world's biggest buyers of illicit 
narcotics. Yet, in hopes of winning certification, Mexico announced 
a $400 million ``total war'' Feb. 4 that calls for buying aircraft, 
ships, radar, X-ray equipment and other items. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico is a major transit point for cocaine shipments from South  
America to the United States. It also is a major producer of 
marijuana and a significant producer of heroin. 
</P>
<P>
	With frictions over drugs, the administration sought to  
highlight progress on another front: booming economic trade between 
the United States and Mexico in the five years since the North 
American Free Trade Agreement, known as NAFTA. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico has emerged as the second largest foreign market for U.S.  
exports, after Canada. It eclipses even Japan, Berger noted. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. exports to Mexico total $79 billion a year, more than twice  
the pre-NAFTA figure. Mexico accounts for close to 20 percent of 
the total of U.S. export growth in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``So it's worth remembering that our trade relationship with  
Mexico has protected a lot of American workers from losing their 
jobs at a time of tremendous uncertainty and upheaval in the global 
economy,'' Berger said.

<HEADLINE> Mardi Gras Kings Meet for 1st Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- In the latest symbol of slowly eroding social  
and racial barriers, a middle-aged white businessman in gaudy gold 
crown and page-boy wig intends to exchange formal greetings with a 
black Mardi Gras king on the waterfront. 
</P>
<P>
	The formal meeting scheduled for Monday night is believed to be  
the first of the two make-believe monarchs: Rex, King of Carnival, 
whose secretive, high-society organization dates back to 1872, and 
King Zulu of the Zulu Social Aid and Pleasure Club, founded in 
1909. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is history-making. This has never taken place,'' said Roy  
Glapion, a city council member and longtime member of Zulu. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting is part of a giant open-air music and fireworks show  
heralding Lundi Gras, or Fat Monday, a warm-up for the raucous 
citywide street party that precedes Lent known as Fat Tuesday -- 
Mardi Gras. 
</P>
<P>
	A Rex official called the planned meeting an ``expression of  
unity'' but discourages any attempt to read any social or racial 
significance into it. ``To us it's irrelevant,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rex and Zulu decided the meeting would be a good way to herald  
the new millennium and mark the 50th anniversary of Louis 
Armstrong's 1949 reign as Zulu. 
</P>
<P>
	But the meeting's racial implications, and its illustration of  
how far Zulu has come in the past century, are inescapable. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even when Louie Armstrong was king in 1949, they had to parade  
on the back streets,'' Glapion said. Zulu was not made part of the 
city's main parade route on Fat Tuesday until 1968, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Carnival historians, such as retired Tulane University  
anthropologist Munro Edmonson, say Zulu started out with 
blue-collar iconoclasts who paraded the streets in African garb and 
minstrel show blackface as a means of thumbing their noses at Mardi 
Gras traditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Zulu members don't dispute that, but play down the satirical  
aspect. Glapion and the club's historians say the name Zulu and the 
traditional costume were adopted by a club of black laborers. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, Zulu adopted its own mythical society in which  
members elect a king, a ``big shot,'' a mayor, an ambassador and 
other officers. It was all in fun then and now, Glapion said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1960s and '70s, club membership declined amid criticism  
that the blackface makeup and witch-doctor apparel, including grass 
skirt, was demeaning, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, however, membership is up to a maximum 375 with a waiting  
list of 75 potential members. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mardi Gras is just make believe anyway,'' said Glapion. ``It's  
just having fun. It's like any Mardi Gras organization -- kings and 
queens are not really kings and queens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The racial rifts in New Orleans were never more apparent than  
seven years ago, when the City Council adopted an ordinance 
requiring parading organizations to open their membership to all 
races. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mystic Krewe of Comus, the city's oldest Mardi Gras club,  
founded in the 1850s, responded by ending its tradition of 
parading. Two other krewes with 19th century roots followed suit. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rex organization integrated, although it remains  
overwhelmingly white. 
</P>
<P>
	Monday's meeting between Rex (whose true identity won't be  
revealed before Monday night's meeting) and Zulu, this year Dr. 
Myron Moorehead, is a sign that the tensions have eased, Glapion 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ordinance, that kind of separated things,'' he said. ``I  
think that what we do on Lundi Gras, maybe that culminates 
activities that bring us together again.''

<HEADLINE> Daytona Challenges Indy 500 for Top </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- In the middle of the speedway infield  
sits a gray, run-down bus with a slogan spray-painted on the back. 
</P>
<P>
	``As you can see, we ain't the Partridge Family,'' it says.  
</P>
<P>
	In a big tent just outside the track fans can pay $1,700 each to  
eat eggs Benedict and drink white wine before going to their 
private suites to watch the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Clearly, the Daytona 500 is for everyone these days.  
</P>
<P>
	For every $250 leather NASCAR jacket, there's a $6 Dale  
Earnhardt key chain. For every $80,000 camper in the infield, there 
are two fans huddled in a pup tent. 
</P>
<P>
	With a new grandstand on the backstretch, about 185,000 fans saw  
the race live Sunday. An estimated 8 million more watched on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the best proof NASCAR and its top race have been able to  
expand their rural, beer-drinkin' Southern roots without leaving 
them behind. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, the Daytona 500 is now considered by many the  
nation's premier auto race, surpassing the Indy 500, which had held 
that distinction with little dispute since it started in 1911. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Daytona people will say what they want to say, and the  
Indy people will say what they want to say,'' said NASCAR president 
Bill France Jr., whose family owns Daytona International Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think the Daytona 500 is one of the great races. Between  
television and what's at the track, more eyeballs have watched this 
race than any other auto race in America the last few years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daytona and NASCAR have cultivated that broad audience with a  
deft mix of enthusiastic sponsors, vibrant personalities and fast, 
competitive racing. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the Indy 500 has been faltering since 1996.  
</P>
<P>
	That's when prominent drivers from the Championship Auto Racing  
Teams (CART) boycotted the race over the formation of the Indy 
Racing League (IRL). 
</P>
<P>
	The Indianapolis 500 remains an IRL race and few of the  
circuit's drivers have become household names. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no such problem in NASCAR. Drivers such as Earnhardt,  
Jeff Gordon, Mark Martin and the Labonte brothers are featured on 
cereal boxes, in gasoline commercials and milk ads -- and everything 
in between. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still watch the Indy race, but in our minds, it's not the  
same,'' said Scott Hunter, a longtime race fan from West Palm 
Beach. ``Ten years ago, I would have told you Indy was a better 
race. But it hasn't been the same since they split things up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defending IRL series champion Kenny Brack said he understands.  
But does that make Daytona, known as The Great American Race, 
better than Indy, billed as The Greatest Spectacle in Racing? 
</P>
<P>
	He would only concede a tie.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've been to a lot of races and I haven't been to a race  
that's bigger than Indy,'' said Brack, in Daytona for the 
International Race of Champions series. 
</P>
<P>
	``This may be the same level, but I don't get the feeling it's a  
lot bigger.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indy 500 champ Eddie Cheever points out that all 320,000 tickets  
for the race sell out within two weeks every year. But he says it 
has to make changes to become the undisputed leader again. 
</P>
<P>
	``IRL has to keep trying to emulate a lot of things NASCAR did  
to make itself more successful,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	That means developing personalities and making the sport as  
friendly to television and advertisers as possible. 
</P>
<P>
	And it's those issues that keep coming up when anyone talks  
about the surge of the Daytona 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Run during a dead spot on the sports calendar, with  
regular-season basketball and golf the only major competition, the 
Daytona 500 drew a 7.7 overnight rating last year. A rating point 
represented 980,000 homes in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	That compares to a 5.6 rating for the Indy 500, which competes  
every Memorial Day weekend with the NBA playoffs, baseball and now, 
its own problems.

	``I remember when Indy used to be something you blocked out the  
day to watch when it was Unser and Andretti,'' said fan Kenny 
Krase, who drove to Daytona from Illinois. ``Once I stopped 
recognizing the drivers, I stopped watching. That's one reason I'm 
here this week, because I feel like I know these guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	NASCAR's success, however, has made it more difficult for the  
grass-roots fan to afford the trip to Daytona. Stewart said he paid 
nearly $200 for his spot in the infield this year, where just a few 
years ago it was closer to $50. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he and his friends find a way to make it each year, while  
the rich and famous keep coming into the fold. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas served as grand  
marshal Sunday and declared: ``Gentlemen, start your engines.'' 
Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre waved the green flag to start the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	``The last few years, it has started getting trendy,'' said  
Stewart's friend Joe, who didn't want his last name used. 
</P>
<P>
	``But there's still room for everyone, from the real rich to the  
middle class to the bottom of the Earth. Everyone can feel 
comfortable here. That's probably why it's so popular.''

<HEADLINE> Barkley Undergoes Knee Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Charles Barkley underwent surgery Sunday for a  
left knee injury that will keep him out of action with the Houston 
Rockets for the next three to four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	In a brief news conference after the afternoon procedure, team  
physician Dr. Walter Lowe said the operation to remove damaged 
cartilage went exactly as planned. 
</P>
<P>
	``Coming into the season in the (good) shape he's in, that's  
going to help tremendously in his rehab,'' Lowe said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley, the league's leading rebounder at 17 per game,  
initially tried to play through his pain last week and treat the 
problem with rehabilitation and medication. 
</P>
<P>
	But after discomfort continued and Barkley had trouble even  
bending his leg Saturday, he and the team chose surgery. Lowe and 
Dr. Bruce Moseley performed the surgery at Methodist Hospital in 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley had led the Rockets after recovering fully from  
off-season double hernia and elbow surgery. During Houston's 4-1 
start, Barkley averaged 19.2 points and collected at least 15 
rebounds in each game. 
</P>
<P>
	Backup Othella Harrington is expected to absorb most of  
Barkley's minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley was typically jovial before and after the procedure and  
was to begin rehabilitating the leg Monday, Lowe said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Charles was his usual self, giving everyone at the hospital a  
hard time,'' Lowe said.

<HEADLINE> Toronto Fans Bid Farewell to Garden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- It was a bittersweet farewell to Maple Leaf  
Gardens -- a loss by the home team in its final game at the storied 
arena, followed by wistful celebrations of the franchise's 
long-gone glory days. 
</P>
<P>
	Many fans wept as the final seconds counted down in Saturday  
night's game between Toronto and Chicago, then wept again, through 
their cheers, as more than 100 former Maple Leafs marched one by 
one onto the rink for a memory-filled postgame ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans, and the Maple Leafs players, yearned for a victory to  
accompany the festivities. But the Blackhawks, who won the first 
game at the Gardens in 1931, again played spoiler, winning 6-2 to 
break a seven-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're disappointed,'' the Leafs' Tie Domi said. ``We're sorry  
we let everybody down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The postgame ceremony, which traced the history of the Gardens  
since its opening, served as a reminder that the Maple Leafs have 
not won a Stanley Cup since 1967. Former players from recent years 
received only modest cheers; the big ovations came for stars from 
the '70s and earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	For the Blackhawks, victory on such a major occasion was a rare  
highlight in a forgettable season. Their heroes for the night were 
particularly unlikely -- Reid Simpson was chosen first star of the 
game after scoring his first two goals of the season, and enforcer 
Bob Probert had the distinction of scoring the final NHL goal at 
the Gardens, only his third goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't write a better script for myself -- something like  
this happening on a night like this,'' Simpson said. ``I'm 
dumbfounded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chicago goalie Jocelyn Thibault raised his record to 2-0 when  
playing in finales at classic old arenas. He helped the Montreal 
Canadiens beat Dallas when the Montreal Forum closed in March 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	``Closing the Forum was a little more special for me because I  
was born in Montreal,'' he said. ``But I knew the importance of the 
game tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The game marked the NHL's departure from the last of the arenas  
built during the 1920s and '30s for the Original Six franchises. 
Now, the league's oldest venue is the Pittsburgh Civic Arena, built 
in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gardens' future is uncertain, though its owners say it will  
remain standing for at least two more years as a venue for minor 
league hockey, pro lacrosse and other events. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Toronto fans were invited to an open house at the  
Leafs' new arena, the Air Canada Centre, which will be inaugurated 
Saturday when the Leafs play Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
	The seats will be more comfortable than those at the Gardens,  
and facilities for the players will be far more plush. But one 
former Leafs player on hand for the farewell game said the magic of 
the Gardens wasn't in the architecture. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bricks and mortar you can get anywhere,'' said Tiger  
Williams, a Leafs star during the 1970s. ``It's the people I'll 
remember.''

<HEADLINE> Community Debates Peanut Allergies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELLINGTON, Conn. (AP) -- For 8-year-old Tim Larew, a sudden and  
horrible death lurks in one of the most all-American of snacks: a 
peanut butter-and-jelly sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's devastating to know that what the average child eats on a  
daily basis can kill your child,'' said Kathy Larew, Tim's mother. 
The second-grader at Windermere Elementary School is allergic to 
all nut products, as well as milk, eggs and soy. 
</P>
<P>
	School systems around the nation are grappling with ways to  
balance the dietary needs of allergic kids like Tim with the rights 
of others who cherish PB&AMP;Js. 
</P>
<P>
	For those with an allergic child, it's a matter of life and  
death. A touch, a taste, sometimes even a whiff of the stuff can 
cause a child to stop breathing and go into shock -- even die. 
</P>
<P>
	At Windermere, protecting Tim means creating a peanut-free zone  
and asking parents to avoid sending peanut-laced items to school, 
among other accommodations. 
</P>
<P>
	But for those moms and dads whose finicky kids live on peanut  
butter, it's a matter of equal rights. The issue has become so 
sticky that many parents at Windermere, afraid of being labeled 
insensitive, were willing to speak only on the condition of 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``My child matters, too,'' said one mother. ``I don't think it's  
correct to change 23 kids for one.'' Another mother complained, ``I 
think the schools are so afraid of lawsuits that they're ignoring 
the rights of other kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of absolute bans, which can arouse antagonism without  
guaranteeing safety, many schools now offer peanut-free cafeteria 
tables, no-sharing policies for foods that may contain traces of 
peanuts, and instructions for teachers on handling allergy 
emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the Food Allergy Network, a Fairfax, Va.-based  
advocacy and support group, about 125 Americans a year die because 
of allergic reactions to foods, with peanuts one of the biggest 
dangers. 
</P>
<P>
	If someone with an extreme allergy to peanuts were to  
accidentally eat even the smallest amount of nut product, she could 
die within minutes. The cause would be a medical term called 
anaphylactic shock, in which the throat swells shut, cutting off 
breathing. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Hugh Sampson, director of the Jaffe Food Allergy Institute  
at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, estimates 1.5 million people 
in the United States are allergic to peanuts. About 20 percent of 
them are so allergic that their lives are at risk, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Food allergies have become so widespread that the U.S.  
Department of Agriculture's school lunch and breakfast programs 
require schools to offer substitutions for allergy-inducing foods. 
</P>
<P>
	When Kathy and Bob Larew learned of Tim's allergies, they were  
determined to give him a normal childhood and enrolled him in 
public school. But how could they keep Tim safe among hundreds of 
grade-schoolers? 
</P>
<P>
	The issue landed in the lap of Frank Milbury, Windermere's  
principal. 
</P>
<P>
	Milbury had to come up with reasonable accommodations for Tim or  
risk defending himself against a discrimination lawsuit under the 
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and the Rehabilitation Act 
of 1973, which ensure access to federally funded services -- 
including education -- for people who have handicapping conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there is something such as an allergy that would prevent  
that child from gaining an education, you really have to make sure 
the child is not forced to deal with that allergic substance,'' 
Milbury said. 
</P>
<P>
	Like most parents with allergic children, the Larews didn't want  
to play the lawsuit card and asked for voluntary measures. 
</P>
<P>
	So over the summer, Milbury sent a letter asking parents to  
avoid classroom snacks containing peanuts, peanut butter or nuts. 
Mrs. Larew gave parents a list of acceptable alternatives, 
including pretzels, chips, fruit and certain crackers. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter didn't go over well with everyone in this school,  
about 15 miles northeast of Hartford. ``It can get ugly,'' Mrs. 
Larew admitted. 
</P>
<P>
	Anne Munoz-Furlong, founder of the Food Allergy Network, said  
the issue has pit parent against parent in communities around the 
country. ``It comes down to: My kid's life or your kid's peanut 
butter sandwich. That's how divided an issue this can become,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Parents have resisted such bans for a variety of reasons. Some  
vegetarians argue peanut butter is a good source of protein while 
others say children's picky appetites rule out alternatives. Others 
fear liability if they forget to read a label or accidentally put a 
brownie with nuts in their child's lunch box. 
</P>
<P>
	When some parents with children assigned to Tim's class  
complained, Milbury allowed transfers to other classes. Others who 
decided to stay had to deal with new routines. 
</P>
<P>
	Upon entering class each morning, all the children must wash  
their hands with a sanitary wipe. At snack time, the rule is ``no 
sharing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A peanut-free zone has been created in the cafeteria. A  
teacher's aide makes sure that only kids with ``safe'' lunches sit 
next to Tim and that no one with a questionable item passes by too 
closely. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers, the school nurse and staff have received special  
training. Medication is always kept nearby, and the school runs 911 
drills each year. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, there have been no mishaps.  
</P>
<P>
	Tim is largely unaware of the controversy. Still, he sometimes  
feels a stigma at special occasions. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sometimes I go to parties after the food is done, or I just  
bring my own piece of cake,'' he said. ``Sometimes I do feel shy. 
It's hard.''

	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- A powerful explosion ripped  
through a commercial area in northwestern Brazil on Sunday, 
injuring five people and razing an entire city block, television 
news reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The early morning blast destroyed at least 42 stores and damaged  
nearby apartments and parked cars in Uberlandia, located 600 miles 
northwest of Rio de Janeiro. Two of the victims had serious 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The blast occurred in a video game parlor and was probably  
sparked by an electrical short, a firefighter identified only as 
Sgt. Duarte told TV Globo News. 
</P>
<P>
	Firemen were still combing the area for more victims Sunday  
afternoon.

	CIUDAD GUZMAN, Mexico (AP) -- Mexican authorities evacuated  
residents of eight hamlets near the flanks of the Colima volcano 
Sunday, while the smoking gray peak shuddered from a new round of 
explosions. 
</P>
<P>
	The evacuations came four days after the volcano, which  
straddles the western Mexico states of Jalisco and Colima, shot ash 
into the air and spewed lava down its slopes. Officials fear a 
larger eruption. 
</P>
<P>
	``Based on the moderate explosions ... the scientific advisory  
committee has decided to increase the security cordon to six 
miles'' around the crater, the National Center for Disaster 
Prevention wrote in a press statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The new evacuation order affects about 350 people. Army troops  
will guard the evacuated villages against looters, and residents 
will be allowed to visit during daylight hours to take care of farm 
animals, the Jalisco state civil defense office reported.

	Ten armed rebels of the Revolutionary Army of the Insurgent  
People issued a statement after visiting the towns Saturday, 
promising to support a campaign for a new election. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels are a small offshoot of the Popular Revolutionary  
Army armed group, which first appeared in the region in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Rene Juarez, candidate of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary  
Party, was declared the winner in the election despite charges of 
electoral fraud by the opposition Democratic Revolution Party. 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic Revolution candidate Felix Salgado, a narrow loser in  
the vote, told supporters at a rally Saturday that his campaign to 
have the vote annulled would be peaceful.

<HEADLINE> NY Gov. Reminds GOP To Keep Faith </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The public may not have been behind Republican  
efforts to oust President Clinton, but it strongly supports other 
GOP endeavors and that is what the party should emphasize, New York 
Gov. George Pataki told Republican leaders Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been so much gnashing of teeth and so much  
psychological review -- I don't think we need that,'' said Pataki, 
who is considering a presidential run in 2000. ``We have shown that 
our policies have worked in large cities and in rural areas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki was the keynote speaker at the Republican Leadership  
Council's winter meeting. The group is an organization of moderate 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Council members spent much of the weekend trying to find ways to  
rebound after failing to convict Clinton on impeachment articles. 
Sen. John McCain said Saturday that the GOP must move on to issues 
that voters consider important. 
</P>
<P>
	``We Republicans have a great deal of work to do to remind  
voters that we are not simply the anti-Clinton party,'' said the 
Arizona Republican, who also is considering a presidential run in 
2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki never mentioned the party's recent failure to convict  
Clinton. Instead, he emphasized Republican successes. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today we have 31 Republican governors -- governors representing  
two-thirds of the American people,'' he said. ``We've stuck to 
those Republican philosophies -- trusting people, lower taxes, less 
government, and more freedom for the individual and the private 
sector.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki has increased his podium appearances in recent weeks,  
speaking about welfare reform, cutting taxes and fighting crime. 
These are goals current governors have accomplished, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is important to talk about the issues that have allowed us  
to govern successfully,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki, 53, easily won re-election to a second term in New York  
in November. 
</P>
<P>
	His enthusiastic approach to the Republican Party's future  
appeared to be getting a good reception. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., said the New York governor sends the  
right message to voters who now might question the GOP and its 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``He deals with issues people care about,'' said Walden.

<HEADLINE> Study: Bulimia Has Basis in Biology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A new study adds to evidence that the eating  
disorder bulimia springs at least in part from a chemical 
malfunction in the brain and not merely from excessive desire to 
remain thin, researchers say. 
</P>
<P>
	In the study, released Sunday, women who had suffered from  
bulimia and recovered were more affected psychologically than other 
women by being deprived of tryptophan, which plays an indirect role 
in appetite regulation, researchers found. 
</P>
<P>
	Tryptophan is an amino acid that occurs naturally in many foods  
and is used by the body to make serotonin, a mood- and 
appetite-regulating chemical in the brain. 
</P>
<P>
	Compared with normal women, the recovered bulimics reported  
bigger dips in mood, greater worries about body image and more fear 
of losing control of eating after being deprived of dietary 
tryptophan for about 17 hours, researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, published in the February issue of the American  
Medical Association's Archives of General Psychiatry, involved 10 
recovered bulimics and 12 normal women. 
</P>
<P>
	Subjects were given identical-looking fruit drinks and snacks in  
the study, some with tryptophan and some without. They were not 
told which was which. 
</P>
<P>
	``These findings suggest that lowered brain serotonin function  
can trigger some of the clinical features of bulimia nervosa in 
individuals vulnerable to the disorder,'' said researchers led by 
Katharine A. Smith of the University of Oxford, England. 
</P>
<P>
	An expert not involved in the study said it adds to growing  
evidence that bulimia, a disorder in which sufferers typically 
alternate between binge eating and starving or purging, is 
biologically rooted and seems to have something to do with the 
system's inability to regulate serotonin. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Walter H. Kaye of the University of Pittsburgh, said he and  
his colleagues last year reported finding abnormal levels of a 
serotonin-related chemical in the spinal fluid of actively bulimic 
women. 
</P>
<P>
	``What this (new study) is saying ... is these disturbances  
persist after people recover -- and more likely are there before 
people develop the disorder -- and these may be the kind of 
vulnerabilities that create eating disorders in the first place,'' 
Kaye said in a telephone interview Friday.

<HEADLINE>  Fans Bid Farewell to Gardens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- From tears to belligerence, emotions ran high at  
Maple Leaf Gardens on Saturday night as sometimes raucous fans 
gathered for the historic arena's final NHL game. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, hordes of revelers pushed and shoved their way into the  
yellow stone building as a lone trumpeter played the funeral march. 
</P>
<P>
	Scalpers commanded $600 for the worst seats in the house and  
nobody batted an eye. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is history,'' said Phillip DuPre, who shelled out $1,500  
for a pair of mid-level seats for himself and his 13-year-old son, 
Jon. ``I grew up watching the Leafs here. No price is too high for 
tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inside, fans wept openly and fights broke out over game  
programs, which sold out long before the puck was dropped for the 
Maple Leafs and Chicago Blackhawks to end NHL hockey's 68-year 
history in the building. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ladies and gentlemen, just bear with us for a few minutes --  
please!'' urged program vendor Rich Bremner, clearly alarmed as 
hundreds of people crowded into a corner of the arena seeking $10 
glossy game programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It never changes here,'' complained bystander Beth Kerchove,  
who waited in line for 20 minutes to buy a corned beef sandwich. 
``They never accommodate their fans and they never had enough 
programs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a shoving match broke out in line, a policeman beseeched the  
zealous fans to calm down. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please, we don't want anybody to get hurt here,'' he said with  
a nervous smile. ``We're all here to have a good time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some customers grew belligerent when they were told they could  
only buy one program each. Worried vendors tried to reassure them 
that programs were still for sale at city book stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the end it got a little bit tense,'' said constable Peter  
Phillipo of Toronto police, who often works at the Maple Leafs 
games. ``But we don't anticipate many problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the nostalgic post-game show was still going on, thousands of  
fans encircled two city blocks, shut down for the celebration. They 
played street hockey, waved flags, cheered and chanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Two teen boys caught up in the revelry, scaled the Maple Leaf  
Gardens sign and did a little dance. They came down after five 
minutes and were not caught by police. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people are like fleas on the big dog,'' said constable  
Tim McMannus, one of a line of cops circling the crowds' perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
	The home team's 6-2 loss to the Chicago Blackhawks didn't seem  
to diminish the spirit of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bad game, good party,'' said Peter Florian, who had painted  
blue leafs on his face and dressed for the occasion in a goalie's 
mask and blue and white team paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
	A hush fell over the crowd just before game time.  
</P>
<P>
	Ellie Reason, 86, began to weep as announcer Paul Morris noted  
that it was the last night for the Maple Leafs and the Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came here the first year it opened, in 1931,'' said Reason,  
decked out in a Maple Leafs jersey. ``But I was from Quebec, so I 
was a Canadiens fan.

<HEADLINE>  Fans Bid Farewell to Gardens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- From tears to belligerence, emotions ran high at  
Maple Leaf Gardens on Saturday night as sometimes raucous fans 
gathered for the historic arena's final NHL game. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, hordes of revelers pushed and shoved their way into the  
yellow stone building as a lone trumpeter played the funeral march. 
</P>
<P>
	Scalpers commanded $600 for the worst seats in the house and  
nobody batted an eye. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is history,'' said Phillip DuPre, who shelled out $1,500  
for a pair of mid-level seats for himself and his 13-year-old son, 
Jon. ``I grew up watching the Leafs here. No price is too high for 
tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inside, fans wept openly and fights broke out over game  
programs, which sold out long before the puck was dropped for the 
Maple Leafs and Chicago Blackhawks to end NHL hockey's 68-year 
history in the building. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ladies and gentlemen, just bear with us for a few minutes --  
please!'' urged program vendor Rich Bremner, clearly alarmed as 
hundreds of people crowded into a corner of the arena seeking $10 
glossy game programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It never changes here,'' complained bystander Beth Kerchove,  
who waited in line for 20 minutes to buy a corned beef sandwich. 
``They never accommodate their fans and they never had enough 
programs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a shoving match broke out in line, a policeman beseeched the  
zealous fans to calm down. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please, we don't want anybody to get hurt here,'' he said with  
a nervous smile. ``We're all here to have a good time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some customers grew belligerent when they were told they could  
only buy one program each. Worried vendors tried to reassure them 
that programs were still for sale at city book stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the end it got a little bit tense,'' said constable Peter  
Phillipo of Toronto police, who often works at the Maple Leafs 
games. ``But we don't anticipate many problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the nostalgic post-game show was still going on, thousands of  
fans encircled two city blocks, shut down for the celebration. They 
played street hockey, waved flags, cheered and chanted. 
</P>
<P>
	Two teen boys caught up in the revelry, scaled the Maple Leaf  
Gardens sign and did a little dance. They came down after five 
minutes and were not caught by police. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people are like fleas on the big dog,'' said constable  
Tim McMannus, one of a line of cops circling the crowds' perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
	The home team's 6-2 loss to the Chicago Blackhawks didn't seem  
to diminish the spirit of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bad game, good party,'' said Peter Florian, who had painted  
blue leafs on his face and dressed for the occasion in a goalie's 
mask and blue and white team paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
	A hush fell over the crowd just before game time.  
</P>
<P>
	Ellie Reason, 86, began to weep as announcer Paul Morris noted  
that it was the last night for the Maple Leafs and the Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came here the first year it opened, in 1931,'' said Reason,  
decked out in a Maple Leafs jersey. ``But I was from Quebec, so I 
was a Canadiens fan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fans used to yell at me when I cheered for my team, and  
call me a swamp singer: a frog. But my husband brought me over to 
the other side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reason's son, Jim, said he bought pricey tickets for himself and  
his mother because he had such fond childhood memories of attending 
games with his parents. 
</P>

	``A hot dog and a soda and I was happy in the greys (the worst  
seats in the house),'' he said.

sweatshirts, collector's plates and silver and bronze commemorative 
coins.

<HEADLINE> Wartime Pen Pals Marry 56 Yrs Later </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOLDIER, Iowa (AP) -- It was the spring of '42 and they were two  
kids living on two continents when pen and paper -- and a school 
assignment -- brought them together. 
</P>
<P>
	She was 14, a student in Miss Frady's class here, when the  
eighth-graders were asked to select a pen pal from a list of kids 
in England. It was a small way of uniting teens during the war. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 14, too, a grocery errand boy outside London, when he  
began writing her. 
</P>
<P>
	They had little in common. She was a fresh-faced girl who rarely  
strayed far from her father's farm. He was a war-weary boy who 
dreamed of traveling the world even as he hunkered down in a dark, 
drafty bomb shelter. 
</P>
<P>
	But the two found enough to write about for years.  
</P>
<P>
	They exchanged photos, too. He was rakish, with dimples, a  
slight gap in his front teeth and hair slicked back like Ray 
Milland. She was demure, with alabaster skin, soft chestnut curls 
and a dreamy gaze. 
</P>
<P>
	When the war ended and he was in the Royal Navy, he wrote to say  
he wanted to visit her in Iowa. She told her fiance, who quickly 
laid down the law: No more letters. 
</P>
<P>
	It seemed the pen pals would never cross paths again.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Dear Sir or Madam,  
</P>
<P>
	``I am writing to see if you can help me in my plight. During  
the war years, I was writing to a girl (as a pen friend) ... . Her 
name was then Miss Colleen Lee. ... If you could by any chance 
trace her for me, I would be very grateful. ... 
</P>
<P>
	``Yours truly,  
</P>
<P>
	``Geoffrey W. Lake''  
</P>
<P>
	The letter was dated Oct. 19, 1989, and now, almost 10 years  
later, Geoffrey still can't say precisely why he decided to look up 
his old pen pal. 
</P>
<P>
	He was 61, happily married for decades to his wife, Eileen, with  
a grown son, Michael. But something tugged at the retired factory 
worker. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was in the back of my mind all these years,'' he says.  
``I'd often wondered what had become of Colleen, what she was 
doing, where she was. One night I decided I've got to find out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He didn't remember Colleen's address but couldn't forget her  
hometown's distinctive name. So he addressed the envelope: 
</P>
<P>
	The Mayor's Parlor  
</P>
<P>
	Soldier, Iowa  
</P>
<P>
	With just 250 souls in Soldier, there are no strangers. It  
turned out the mayor and Colleen were good friends. She was now 
Colleen Straight, having long ago married her childhood sweetheart, 
Harvey. 
</P>
<P>
	The Straights, who had lived in California and Virginia, had  
returned to this western Iowa hamlet 17 years earlier; Harvey ran 
the local steakhouse. By 1989, their three children were adults, 
having children of their own. 
</P>
<P>
	Geoffrey, meanwhile, had circled the globe, from Bali to the  
Panama Canal, Canada to Holland, first with the Navy, then on his 
own. But he always migrated back to the same area 45 minutes from 
London. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Eileen were planning to visit the United States when his  
note arrived in Soldier. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got this letter from some fellow in England,'' the mayor  
told Colleen. 
</P>
<P>
	She smiles as she remembers that day:  
</P>
<P>
	``I knew right away who it was.''  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Dear Geoff,  
</P>
<P>
	``What a surprise! I believe it's 45 years since we corresponded  
... .'' 
</P>
<P>
	Where to begin? Colleen dashed off a breezy three-page letter  
describing her family and where they had lived over the years. She 
also invited Geoffrey and Eileen to Soldier. 
</P>
<P>
	And she signed off:  
</P>
<P>
	``Your pen pal, Colleen''  
</P>
<P>
	Back in Waltham Abbey, Geoffrey was thrilled.  
</P>
<P>
	And so, they began corresponding again. They shared  
over-the-fence tidbits about daily life, everything from details 
about a family wedding to Geoffrey's woozy adventure with triple 
brandies on a vacation in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	They always signed their letters as couples.  
</P>
<P>
	Colleen and Harvey. Eileen and Geoff.  
</P>
<P>
	There was no romance. ``It was a friendship all the way  
through,'' Geoffrey says. 
</P>
<P>
	Not that there wasn't some good-natured ribbing when the mail  
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
	``Harvey would say, 'You got another letter from your  
boyfriend,' '' Colleen recalls. 
</P>
<P>
	Geoffrey's wife did the same.  
</P>
<P>
	Again they exchanged photos, this time showing their families  
and their houses. Then in December 1992, Colleen had sad news. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not an easy letter to write,'' she confided. ``I lost  
Harvey. ... I know I must not dwell on his passing, but I do think 
of it a lot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Geoffrey responded with a condolence card, and one each year on  
the anniversary of Harvey's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Geoffrey and Eileen's plans to visit Colleen the next year fell  
through, but the letters continued. 
</P>
<P>
	Then in November 1997, Geoffrey's wife of 45 years died.  
</P>
<P>
	This time, Colleen did the consoling.  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Dear Geoff and Michael,  
</P>
<P>
	It's difficult at this sad time to find the right words to  
comfort you. You will find yourself thinking of all the things you 
have done together and that helps a lot. ... Just be thankful you 
had a good life together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On a January night a year ago, a downcast Geoffrey dialed his  
phone. He was tempted to hang up before a little girl answered in a 
cozy living room 4,300 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	``Grandmother, somebody I can't understand wants to talk you,''  
10-year-old Ashley said, handing Colleen the receiver. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hello, Colleen, do you know who this is?'' the caller asked.  
</P>
<P>
	His clipped accent gave him away.  
</P>
<P>
	For the first time in 56 years the childhood correspondents  
spoke to one another. 
</P>
<P>
	``After hearing his voice, I think I felt he was real,'' Colleen  
says. ``Before it was just pen and pencil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They talked for a while and at the end, Colleen recalls, ``He  
said, 'Goodbye, love.' I really took that to heart. I thought, boy 
... he means business! But that's just an everyday phrase in 
England.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, she says, ``It sort of melted my heart.''  
</P>
<P>
	Geoffrey wanted to visit her, though Colleen felt it was too  
soon for the new widower. So she delicately put him off. 
</P>
<P>
	But their calls and letters picked up. Weekly, twice weekly,  
daily. Then two, three times a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Their words became more tender, their thoughts more intimate.  
</P>
<P>
	``We more or less--'' Geoffrey begins.  
</P>
<P>
	``... struck up a romance,'' Colleen finishes his sentence.  
</P>
<P>
	Their letters began with ``My darling'' and ``My love.'' They  
ended with a string of X's for kisses. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the two had never even spent an hour together.  
</P>
<P>
	``We talked about maybe we wouldn't like one another at all,''  
Colleen says. ``We had no idea what our temperaments would really 
be like. You can't tell that by letter writing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he persisted and finally she agreed to meet him.  
</P>
<P>
	``In the end,'' he says, ``I won the day.''  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``My darling Colleen,  
</P>
<P>
	``It sounds a bit ridiculous the way we feel about one another.  
Here we are, both approaChing the age of 70 and carrying on as 
though we are teen-agers but honey, I've got a young heart and 
cannot express my feelings any other way. I love it and I love you, 
honey. 
</P>
<P>
	``Roll on May 28!''  
</P>
<P>
	That was the date they agreed to meet in New York.  
</P>
<P>
	The appointed place was the customs desk at Kennedy airport.  
Geoffrey said he'd be carrying a Tesco bag (the name of a British 
supermarket). Inside was a bottle of champagne and a fruitcake the 
former Navy chef had made to woo her with his baking talents. 
</P>
<P>
	``Turned out quite good,'' he boasts.  
</P>
<P>
	When Colleen's plane was 3 1/2 hours late, Geoffrey worried he had  
been stood up. Then he saw a 5-foot woman with short brown hair 
approaching. 
</P>
<P>
	He recognized the bejeweled denim outfit she had described.  
</P>
<P>
	She spotted the supermarket bag.  
</P>
<P>
	``Our eyes met,'' Colleen says. ``We embraced.''  
</P>
<P>
	``It was love at first sight,'' Geoffrey adds.  
</P>
<P>
	They spent three days touring New York before heading to Iowa,  
where he met her family. Then it was off to Mount Rushmore -- where 
they bought friendship rings decorated with hearts. 
</P>
<P>
	Everything clicked. There was no tension, no shyness, no  
awkwardness. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just talked as if we had been meeting for some time,'' says  
Geoffrey, a wiry man with blue-gray eyes and a healthy shock of 
silver-and-black hair. 
</P>
<P>
	In no time, Geoffrey decided to move to Iowa. He returned home  
to settle some personal matters, then on his first night back last 
September, he bent on one knee and proposed to Colleen. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said yes!'' she recalls, turning to Geoffrey as they sit at  
their kitchen table. ``I didn't even stop to think about it, did 
I?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He leans in, puffs his Marlboro Light, then quietly offers his  
own recollection: 
</P>
<P>
	``Teary-eyed, she was.''  
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Two flags -- the Stars and Stripes and the Union Jack -- flutter  
outside the white-frame house at the end of the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Inside, Geoffrey, wearing a gold-and-black Iowa Hawkeyes  
sweatshirt, marvels at the turn of events. 
</P>
<P>
	``A half century and we're together again -- well, not again,  
we're NOW together,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like a fairy tale,'' Colleen says. ``People say it  
was just meant to be. And we're both happier for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``More than happy,'' Geoffrey adds.  
</P>
<P>
	On Nov. 28, the wartime pen pals became husband and wife. They  
sent out word to friends and family: 
</P>
<P>
	``A reception honoring the newlyweds Colleen and Geoff will be  
on Saturday ... .'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was their first joint correspondence.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chairman Says BMW Not for Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Germany's BMW AG on Sunday repeated it  
wasn't on the market, after a newspaper reported earlier General 
Motors Corp. planned to offer to buy the Bavarian company. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing to it,'' BMW's new chairman Joachim Milberg  
said at a meeting with the governor of Bavaria, Edmund Stoiber. 
</P>
<P>
	``BMW is and remains independent,'' Milberg said.  
</P>
<P>
	Renewed rumors of a takeover bid for BMW swirled Saturday after  
German daily Die Welt reported Detroit-based General Motors, the 
biggest car company in the world, planned to make an offer. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors on Saturday declined to comment on the report.  
</P>
<P>
	Speculation on BMW's future has mounted along with losses at its  
British subsidiary, Rover. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW has invested more than $3.5 billion since buying the company  
in 1994. Yet analysts expect Rover to post a pretax loss of about 
$590 million for 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Takeover and merger rumors were stoked when Bernd Pischetsrieder  
resigned as BMW chairman 10 days ago, amid criticism of his 
handling of Rover. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW's main shareholder, the Quandt family, has consistently said  
its 46 percent stake isn't for sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Motor Co. president Jac Nasser last week declined to rule  
out a possible acquisition of German automaker BMW AG, but said he 
believes BMW and its major shareholders when they say they want to 
remain independent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't rule out anybody,'' Nasser said. ``But I think when  
a company with the stature of BMW and their board come out and say 
they want to be independent, you have to respect that.''

<HEADLINE> Skier Kjus Earns Record Fifth Medal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- Norway's Lasse Kjus won a record fifth medal  
at the World Alpine Ski Championships, finishing second in the 
slalom to surprise winner Kalle Palander of Finland Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus, who became the fourth skier in history to win four medals  
in a world championship when he won the giant slalom Friday, set 
the record with his fifth medal in the concluding event of these 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
	Going a perfect 5-for-5, he also won gold in super-G and claimed  
silver in downhill and combined. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus tied teammate Kjetil Andre Aamodt and Luxembourg's Marc  
Girardelli for the most medals won in both world championships and 
Olympics -- 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a fantastic feeling,'' Kjus said. ``I can't believe it.''  
</P>
<P>
	Kjus led the first run of slalom, .19 seconds ahead of Austria's  
Christian Mayer. Italy's Giorgio Rocca was third, .41 seconds off 
the pace. The unheralded Palander stood seventh, .78 seconds behind 
Kjus. 
</P>
<P>
	Palander, starting in the first seed of slalom for the first  
time after matching his previous career best with a sixth-place 
finish in a slalom last month at Kitzbuhel, Austria, had the 
fastest second run. 
</P>
<P>
	His time of 49.92 gave him a combined time of 1:42.12.  
</P>
<P>
	Six subsequent racers couldn't dislodge him from the lead.  
</P>
<P>
	Kjus was .76 seconds faster than Palander through the  
intermediate clocking but lost time on the bottom of the steep, icy 
course, and his 50.81 second run -- only the eighth-fastest -- 
dropped him to second place at 1:42.23. 
</P>
<P>
	When Kjus' time was flashed on the scoreboard, a disbelieving  
Palander danced in the finish area, punching the air with his skis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I stood in the start for a minute and got myself together,''  
Palander said. ``When I came down, I thought, `OK, maybe a medal.' 
It must have been the last part where I made up all the time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that third place is unbelievable. I told my coach  
after the first run, `Maybe three.' But a gold medal, unbelievable. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm trying to understand this. Maybe tomorrow it will be  
easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayer, who was scrubbed from the super-G because of the depth of  
the Austrian team, held on for the bronze at 1:42.25. 
</P>
<P>
	Rocca was fourth at 1:42.33, followed by Austrian rookie  
Benjamin Raich at 1:42.55. 
</P>
<P>
	Austria's Thomas Stangassinger, who leads the World Cup slalom  
standings this season, charged from 12th place after the first run 
to finish sixth at 1:42.82. Aamodt rallied from 15th to finish 
seventh at 1:42.91. 
</P>
<P>
	Bode Miller of Franconia, N.H., 30th out of the start house, was  
13th after the first run and wound up eighth at 1:42.94. Sacha Gros 
of Vail, Colo., was 19th at 1:45.60. 
</P>
<P>
	In the first run, three skiers in the top seed missed gates  
coming over a pitch into the final steep, including France's

<HEADLINE> School Cancels Ethnic Festivities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- A high school has canceled festivities  
for Black History Month and Cinco de Mayo to avoid the kind of 
violence that erupted between black and Hispanic students during 
celebrations last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Last May, the Inglewood High School campus, 10 miles south of  
downtown Los Angeles, was forced to close for a day after a riot 
broke out and dozens of police were called in. 
</P>
<P>
	A task force found that the fight began, in part, because  
Hispanic students who comprise about half the school population 
felt slighted. They were angry that a month was set aside to honor 
black history but only a day to celebrate Cinco de Mayo. 
</P>
<P>
	Black History Month is traditionally celebrated in February.  
Cinco de Mayo commemorates a May 5, 1862 victory in Mexico's battle 
for independence from France. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of celebrating Black History Month and Cinco de Mayo,  
new Principal Lowell Winston has told teachers to follow a 
``multicultural education approach'' throughout the school year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm saying, why should we have black history taught in just  
one month?'' Winston said. ``Let's talk about all cultures and 
contributions all the time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't continue to do things the way they were done in the  
past,'' he said. ``This school has had racial problems that are 
unique ... the old ways didn't work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A group of black and Hispanic students planned an assembly this  
month to highlight the contributions of both cultures, said Monica 
Landa, 17, who is president of a Hispanic student group. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish that nothing had changed,'' said 17-year-old LaToya  
Stance, a black member of the student government. ``But every year 
we've got these people fighting. So maybe now we should do anything 
to make sure there's no fighting.''

 *William Fields    	
</P>
<P>
	TUPELO, Miss. (AP) -- Financial consultant William T. Fields,  
founder of the telecommunications company that evolved into 
industry giant MCI-WorldCom, died Saturday of pancreatic cancer. He 
was 52. 
</P>
<P>
	Fields was best known for his role in founding Long Distance  
Discount Service in June 1984. He was one of nine original 
investors in the company that took advantage of AT&AMP;T's divestiture 
of its Bell companies in the early 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	Originally formed as a telephone equipment company, LDDS soon  
grew into a long-distance company. Fields was named the company's 
first chief executive officer and was chairman of the board. 
</P>
<P>
	After less than a year at the helm, Fields turned over the  
company's operations to a hand-picked successor, Bernie Ebbers. The 
company has since become MCI-WorldCom, which is now second only to 
AT&AMP;T as the world's largest telecommunications company.

 *Bradford Grow    	
</P>
<P>
	O'FALLON, Ill. (AP) -- Bradford Grow, retired pioneer of naval  
aviation and decorated veteran of the Guadalcanal campaign, died 
Thursday. He was 99. 
</P>
<P>
	Grow, a retired rear admiral, graduated from the Naval Academy  
in 1922 and began his flying career four years later. 
</P>
<P>
	Grow first served as a service squadron pilot on a battleship,  
the USS New York, and later flew early dive bombers from an 
aircraft carrier, the USS Saratoga. 
</P>
<P>
	A highlight of Grow's aviation career came in 1939, when he led  
a squadron of amphibious planes on a round-trip flight between San 
Diego and Panama without refueling to demonstrate the aircraft's 
capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	During World War II, Grow commanded aircraft carriers, including  
the USS Kasaan Bay and the USS Lexington, in the Pacific and 
European theaters. 
</P>
<P>
	At Guadalcanal, Grow presided over the calm evacuation of the  
USS Wasp as it sank under enemy fire. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Grow's World War II honors are the Bronze Star, the Legion  
of Merit and the French Croix de Guerre. He retired from the Navy 
in 1952.

 *Prasit Kanchanawat    	
</P>
<P>
	BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Prasit Kanchanawat, a prominent  
politician in the bloody upheaval that rocked Thailand in the 
1970s, died Sunday of cancer. He was 84. 
</P>
<P>
	A commoner who served in both military and civilian governments,  
Prasit was a lawyer and banker before becoming a member of 
parliament in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	Prasit held several high-level economic posts in the 1960s  
before becoming commerce minister in 1972 under the premiership of 
Field Marshal Thanom Kittakchorn. 
</P>
<P>
	Thanom's government was overthrown in a mass uprising against  
military rule in 1973. A fragile experiment with democracy ensued. 
</P>
<P>
	Prasit was speaker of the first -- though short-lived -- elected  
parliament in 1975. New elections in April 1976 led to Seni Pramoj, 
leader of Thai resistance against Japanese occupation in World War 
II, becoming prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
	Prasit was justice minister in Seni's government, which fell in  
October 1976 as the military and right-wing extremists massacred 
leftist students and staged a coup. 
</P>
<P>
	The coup ended Prasit's political career. In later years, he  
served on the board of directors of Bangkok Bank, Thailand's 
largest financial institution.

 *Cecil Smith    	
</P>
<P>
	BOERNE, Texas (AP) -- Cecil Smith, a polo player who won  
virtually every award the sport offers and propelled the 
competition from amateur to international status in a career 
spanning more than six decades, died Jan. 21. He was 94. 
</P>
<P>
	Often referred to by writers as the ``Babe Ruth of polo,'' Smith  
won every major U.S. high-goal tournament of his time. He was 
inducted into the Texas Sports Hall of Fame in 1956 and was one of 
the first six players to be elected to the Polo Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
	Friends said Smith left a world-class mark on his sport. His  
horses also won numerous awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith began his polo career in 1924 in the Texas Hill Country.  
By 1930, he was an alternate on the U.S. international team. In 
1938 and for the next decade, he was a 10-goal player, the sport's 
highest ranking and one achieved by only 20 American-born players. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's 1938 Texas Ranger team was the only foursome to win  
every major tournament in England. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's team also beat the Eastern polo establishment in a  
three-game series won by Texas-bred horses. Until then, his Texas 
pedigree had been unacceptable in polo society. 
</P>
<P>
	With a style of play that inspired teamwork, Smith lifted polo  
from an amateur sport to a match of gamesmanship played by 
professional horsemen.

<HEADLINE> Unbeaten Sonics To Be Tested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- This is the week the Seattle SuperSonics will  
find out how good they are. 
</P>
<P>
	Winning their first five games against Portland, Dallas, Denver  
and Golden State (twice) is nice. But victories against Utah and 
the Los Angeles Lakers would mean a lot more. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of games coming up that figure to be tough,''  
new coach Paul Westphal said. ``We hope to win them all but we 
can't expect to win them all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Led by All-Star point guard Gary Payton, the Sonics are off to  
their best start since the 1993-94 season, when they won their 
first 10 under George Karl. 
</P>
<P>
	In Saturday night's 105-92 home win over Denver, Payton scored  
28 points, had a season-high 16 assists and grabbed nine rebounds. 
He abandoned his jump shot, driving into the teeth of the Nuggets' 
defense and attempting 20 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gary is playing as well or better than anybody in the NBA,''  
Westphal said. ``He makes a lot of big plays offensively and 
defensively -- and when we need them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Sonics have come out strong after the long NBA lockout and  
Karl's firing. The popular coach was dismissed after Seattle 
followed a 61-victory regular season with a dismal showing in the 
playoffs against the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Team president Wally Walker also didn't bring back Sam Perkins,  
Greg Anthony and Jerome Kersey, all Karl favorites. 
</P>
<P>
	And, admitting a blunder, he gave up on center Jim McIlvaine and  
traded him to New Jersey. Then he signed free agents Olden Polynice 
and Billy Owens, who played at Sacramento last season. 
</P>
<P>
	Owens started the first four games at Hersey Hawkins' old spot  
at shooting guard before going on the injured list with a broken 
left little finger. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting with Payton, Polynice, Vin Baker and Detlef Schrempf  
against Dallas was Rashard Lewis, 19. Lewis didn't remind anybody 
of Kobe Bryant, the Lakers' young star, but he scored eight points 
and had five rebounds in 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sonics were growing old under Karl. They're going to get  
younger under Westphal, who also has plans to use 7-foot rookie 
Vladimir Stepania this season. 
</P>
<P>
	Payton is looking forward to this week, when the Sonics are at  
home Tuesday night against Utah and Wednesday night against 
Sacramento before traveling to Salt Lake City to face the Jazz 
Saturday. Seattle is back home against the Lakers next Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's way too early,'' Payton said when asked to evaluate his  
team. ``We just need to keep winning and beat someone other than 
teams trying to rebuild.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Five games into the season, Baker still doesn't look like an  
All-Star forward and hasn't made a free throw, while Schrempf, 36, 
is starting to show his age. 
</P>
<P>
	But Polynice is rebounding and playing solid defense, two things  
McIlvaine didn't do for the Sonics. And Hawkins and Dale Ellis, 38, 
give Westphal scoring punch off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawkins broke out of a shooting slump with 20 points against  
Dallas and Ellis added 17. Combined, they were 9 of 10 from 3-point 
range. 
</P>
<P>
	``Being able to have these two is quite a luxury,'' Westphal  
said. ``Most teams would like to have just one of them.''

<HEADLINE> Chaotic Start to Women's World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Four months before the first match is  
played, the Women's World Cup got off to a somewhat chaotic start 
on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The draw for the 32-match event, to run June 19-July 10 in seven  
U.S. cities, resulted in confusion about which nation the Americans 
will play in their opening match and got more confusing when 
officials switched around two groups for marketing reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States drew North Korea, Nigeria and Denmark in its  
group for first-round matches. The Americans have six wins and a 
tie in their 10 games against Denmark, while the U.S. squad has 
never played North Korea or Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
	FIFA president Sepp Blatter announced during the draw ceremony,  
televised live throughout the United States, that the U.S. team 
will face North Korea in its opening match June 19 at Giants 
Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	But Women's World Cup officials later said the U.S. team will  
face Denmark in that opening match. The Americans will play Nigeria 
at Chicago's Soldier Field on June 24 and complete their 
first-round matches against North Korea at Foxboro Stadium outside 
Boston on June 27. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers also switched around two groups. China originally was  
announced as the top-seeded team in Group C and Norway, the 
defending champion, as the top-seeded team in Group D. But those 
group assignments later were switched, with Norway heading up Group 
C and China leading Group D. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the schedule released weeks ago, the top team in  
Group D is scheduled to play its first match in San Jose and the 
top team in Group C will play its first game at Foxboro. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers said they decided to switch the group assignments  
because they wanted China to play its opener in the San Francisco 
Bay area, which has a large Asian community. 
</P>
<P>
	``The decision was made for local marketing reasons by the  
Women's World Cup organizing committee, based on the tremendous 
Chinese population in northern California and the interest we 
received from different Chinese organizations to bring the team to 
this venue,'' said Steve Vanderpool, vice president of 
communications for the Women's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The draw was held at halftime of a match won 2-1 by a squad of  
world all-stars against the U.S. national team. Charmaine Hooper of 
Canada scored twice in the second half for the world all-stars. 
Julie Foudy scored the U.S. goal midway through the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. midfielder Michelle Akers left the game in the first half,  
her face bloodied, and was taken to a hospital after bumping heads 
with a world all-star player on a jump ball situation in front of 
the world all-stars' goal. She had a severe cut over her left 
eyebrow that was expected to need four stitches, and a bruised 
cheekbone. 
</P>
<P>
	Donna de Varona, chair of the organizing committee for the  
Women's World Cup, asked fans for their support this June and July. 
</P>
<P>
	``Come this summer and fill the stadiums, and excite young girls  
all over the world,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Blatter, head of soccer's world governing body, has said  
repeatedly that ``the future of football is feminine'' and said 
Sunday that female soccer players have a distinct advantage over 
their male counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
	``They don't cheat. They don't grip the shirt. They don't feign  
a foul,'' Blatter said. ``It's not like the men, who lie on the 
field and are taken off the field on a stretcher, and 30 seconds 
later they're running faster than ever.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Women's World Cup, being billed as the largest women-only  
sporting event in history, will have games in or near Boston, 
Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco/San Jose, Washington 
D.C. and Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States won the inaugural Women's World Cup in 1991 in  
China. Norway won the title in 1995 in Sweden.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Might Run for NY Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the impeachment trial over, first lady  
Hillary Rodham Clinton will give serious thought to running for the 
Senate from New York next year, senior White House officials said 
Sunday. Democrats and Republicans alike predicted a terrific race 
if she steps in. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of people ``have been really urging her to run, and I  
think she wants to hear them out,'' White House Chief of Staff John 
Podesta said on ABC's ``This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of people in New York who think she would be a  
great senator and are very excited about the prospect that she 
would represent them,'' added White House communications director 
Ann Lewis on CNN's ``Late Edition.'' ``I do think she would win,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Talk has been circulating for several months of prospects that  
Mrs. Clinton would run for the seat to be vacated when Democratic 
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan leaves the Senate in 2000 after 24 
years in office. 
</P>
<P>
	Moynihan, interviewed on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' said ``she'd  
be welcome and she'd win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said New York could probably use some of her ``magnificent,  
young, bright, able, Illinois-Arkansas enthusiasm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She's going to be very deliberative about this. This is going  
to be a major life change,'' said Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg 
from neighboring New Jersey, adding ``I think she would be one 
terrific candidate,'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be an incredible race,'' said Sen. John McCain,  
R-Ariz., of a possible matchup with New York's Republican Mayor 
Rudy Giuliani. ``One thing I know about Rudy Giuliani, he'll tangle 
with anybody,'' he said on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who is in charge of money-raising  
for GOP senatorial campaigns, said on CNN that Mrs. Clinton's entry 
into a race against Giuliani ``would make this a titanic struggle 
of two very popular figures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is expected to be very much in the public eye now  
that the impeachment trial is over. She is going to travel around 
the country promoting her husband's Social Security and Medicare 
proposals, make another ``spring break'' mission overseas, probably 
with daughter Chelsea, and take her ``America's treasures'' tour to 
the West to promote historic preservation. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsweek, in its edition appearing on newsstands Monday, said  
that during the impeachment trial Mrs. Clinton played an active 
role in her husband's defense, although she did not attend staff 
meetings. It said her focus was on constitutional issues and it was 
her ideas to bring constitutional scholars before the House 
Judiciary Committee.

<HEADLINE> Report: Russia To Aid Iraq Defense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Russia has signed a $160 million deal to reinforce  
Iraq's air defenses and upgrade squadrons of MiG fighters, The 
Sunday Telegraph reported, quoting unidentified diplomatic sources 
in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
	The London newspaper said the move was a serious threat to U.S.  
and British warplanes patrolling the ``no-fly'' zones, scenes of 
almost daily confrontations with Iraq since December. 
</P>
<P>
	The agreements were signed in Moscow on Jan. 13 and 14 after a  
visit to the Russian capital by Ahmed Murtada Ahmed Khalil, Iraq's 
Transport and Communications Minister, The Sunday Telegraph said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Moscow, the Russian Foreign Ministry declined immediate  
comment. Russia's NTV television news reported that MiG officials 
said they ``knew nothing'' about the reported deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The pro-conservative newspaper said the decision to give Iraqi  
President Saddam Hussein military help was approved by Russian 
Prime Minister Yevgeni Primakov on Dec. 7 in violation of the 
United Nations arms embargo on Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has consistently opposed military attacks on Iraq aimed  
at making Saddam comply with U.N. inspectors trying to determine if 
Iraq had destroyed its weapons of mass destruction. It has also 
signed contracts to rebuild Iraq's oil industry, but the deals 
won't take effect until the sanctions are lifted. 
</P>
<P>
	The sanctions were imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990,  
sparking the Gulf War, and cannot be lifted until U.N. officials 
confirm Iraq's heavy weapons have been destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. and British warplanes have prohibited Iraqi military  
flights over ``no fly'' zones in northern and southern Iraq since 
shortly after the 1991 Gulf War to protect Kurdish rebel and Shiite 
Muslim groups.

<HEADLINE> Quartley Humbled in Native Ghana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ACCRA, Ghana (AP) -- Ghanaian boxing fans turned on Ike Quartey,  
taking to the streets Sunday to assail a countryman many believe 
has become arrogant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ike is not a disciplined boxer, and moreover, since he became  
a champion, he treats us ... even some of his own family members, 
with scorn, so there is no need to support him,'' said Amarkai, a 
resident of the Bukom suburb where Quartey was born. 
</P>
<P>
	Quartey, nicknamed ``The Bazooka,'' lost a 12-round split  
decision to Oscar De La Hoya in Las Vegas on Saturday night in a 
WBC welterweight title bout. 
</P>
<P>
	Bare-chested youths carried placards with the words ``Bazooka is  
a loser'' and ``Ike, you no match for Oscar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some fans, who still supported their idol, stood quietly, with  
flags hanging loosely off their necks. Others argued about what the 
challenger should have done to win. 
</P>
<P>
	Quartey, who had not fought since October 1997, knocked down De  
La Hoya in the sixth round when both fighters went down. But De La 
Hoya clinched the victory by knocking down Quartey 12 seconds into 
the 12th round. 
</P>
<P>
	Quartey, the former WBA champion, was stripped of the title for  
failing to defend it against Andrei Pastriez of Russia in August.

<HEADLINE> Poll: US Supports Clinton Acquittal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A majority of Americans think the Senate was  
right to acquit President Clinton of impeachment charges and 
believe Republicans pursued the matter for political reasons, 
according to a Los Angeles Times poll released Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty-five percent of those surveyed after Friday's Senate vote  
supported the acquittal, while 30 percent thought Clinton should 
have been removed from office. 
</P>
<P>
	The results were similar to those of polls conducted Friday and  
Saturday by other news organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, The Washington Post reported in Monday's editions  
that a poll conducted Feb. 12-14 found 68 percent approve of the 
way Clinton is doing his job compared to 46 percent who approve of 
the way Congress is doing its job. The figures reflected an 8-point 
gain for Clinton from a similar poll in January 1998, while showing 
a statistically insignificant 1-point decline for Congress. The 
survey of 1,010 adults had a margin of error of 3 percentage 
points. 
</P>
<P>
	Sixty-two percent of those surveyed in the Los Angeles Times  
poll thought Republicans in Congress pursued impeachment because 
they wanted to hurt Clinton politically; 34 percent said 
Republicans were motivated by concern for the nation's legal and 
moral fabric. 
</P>
<P>
	Fifty-six percent disapproved of the way the Senate handled the  
impeachment trial, and 57 percent said the final debate should have 
been open. 
</P>
<P>
	As with other polls, this one found little support for censuring  
Clinton. Just 38 percent of respondents favored a Senate censure 
resolution, while 47 percent opposed it. 
</P>
<P>
	The telephone poll of 664 adults nationwide had a margin of  
error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Lakers' Signing of Rodman Imminent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Dennis Rodman is expected to be in a  
Los Angeles Lakers uniform Tuesday night against the Charlotte 
Hornets, a source close to the team said Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said late  
Sunday he expected Rodman to sign a contract ``late tonight, 
tomorrow, or Tuesday at the latest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers first expressed an interest in the seven-time NBA  
rebounding champion two weeks ago when he met with owner Jerry Buss 
for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, who has led the league in rebounding for the past seven  
seasons, didn't attend the Lakers' 101-99 loss to Indiana on 
Sunday, although the word spreading around the Forum was that he 
had tickets but didn't use them. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, who turns 38 in May, has played on five of the last 10  
NBA champions, including the last three with the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	His career scoring average is just 7.5 points, but he is one of  
the greatest rebounders in league history with a 13.2 average. No 
other player ever won seven straight rebounding titles. 
</P>
<P>
	After Michael Jordan's retirement last month, the Bulls opted  
not to pursue Rodman. He flirted with the idea of signing with 
Orlando or Miami, but both teams backed off. 
</P>
<P>
	Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal has said repeatedly he supports  
the acquisition of Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	With Rodman's history, it's impossible to assume anything is  
certain. As far as his erratic behavior is concerned, Lakers coach 
Del Harris said if Rodman becomes a member of the team, he won't 
prejudge him. 
</P>
<P>
	``You really don't know a player until you've coached him in  
this league,'' Harris said Saturday. ``I think you're better off 
not listening to the rumors and everything and just finding out 
ways to work with the people that you do have. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are always ways to work with people. You just have to  
find the different communicating methods that are required or in 
some cases non-communicating methods that are required and go from 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked before Sunday's game if Rodman would be the missing  
link for the Lakers, Harris replied, ``We certainly have done well 
so far without Dennis. You never want to say you can't get 
someplace if you don't have somebody you don't have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers can only offer him the veterans' minimum of $1  
million -- pro-rated to $600,000 for this lockout-shortened season -- 
but he'll also earn $3 million from his endorsement contract with 
Converse.

	American Cancels More Flights  
</P>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- American Airlines canceled 550 flights today, even  
though more than half of the American Airlines pilots participating 
in a sickout reported to work. The mass return followed a judge's 
contempt order yesterday against the pilots union and two of its 
top officials. Another 231 flights, or about 10 percent, of the 
flights scheduled for the Presidents Day holiday tomorrow have 
already been canceled because not all of the pilots were 
immediately available for flying. An American spokeswoman said 
``well under 1,000'' of the 9,400 pilots were still shown as sick 
today.

	Poll: US Supports Clinton Acquittal  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A majority of Americans think the Senate was  
right to acquit President Clinton of impeachment charges and 
believe Republicans pursued the matter for political reasons, 
according to a Los Angeles Times poll released today. Sixty-five 
percent of those surveyed after Friday's Senate vote supported the 
acquittal, while 30 percent thought Clinton should have been 
removed from office. Sixty-two percent of those surveyed thought 
Republicans in Congress pursued impeachment because they wanted to 
hurt Clinton politically; 34 percent said Republicans were 
motivated by concern for the nation's legal and moral fabric.

	Iraq Says It Can Attack U.S. Bases  
</P>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- The Iraqi government said today it could  
attack American and British bases in the Persian Gulf that are used 
to launch airstrikes against Iraq. The statement came amid a 
simmering war of nerves with the United States and Britain over 
``no-fly'' zones imposed in northern and southern Iraq. Iraq does 
not recognize the zones and has vowed to fire at any plane that 
violates its airspace. The United States has accused Iraq of more 
than 90 violations of the no-fly zones since mid-December. U.S. and 
British forces have retaliated by attacking more than 40 Iraqi 
targets.

	Kosovo Talks Get New Deadline  
</P>
<P>
	PARIS (AP) -- Rival Serbs and ethnic Albanians today were given  
another week to consider their plan for ending the violent conflict 
in the Yugoslavian province of Kosovo. Secretary of State Madeleine 
Albright brought the two sides together today, face-to-face, for 
the first time. So far, the Serbs have resisted the prospect of a 
NATO peacekeeping force deployed in the province in the event of a 
settlement, and Albright said even the Albanians had not promised 
to sign the deal by the deadline of next Saturday at noon.

	Clinton Heads to Mexico  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is en route to Mexico for a  
brief summit with President Ernesto Zedillo. The visit -- 23 hours 
from landing to takeoff -- comes two weeks before the administration 
must render a formal evaluation of Mexico's cooperation in fighting 
drug trafficking. The two leaders also are expected to discuss 
immigration and complete an agreement on border safety and curbing 
border violence. 

</P>
<P>
	Indians More Likely To Be Victims  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- American Indians are more than twice as likely  
as others to become victims of violent crime, the Justice 
Department reported today in its first comprehensive analysis of 
Indians and crime. The study by the Bureau of Justice Statistics 
also found that on any given day one in 25 Indian adults is either 
incarcerated or on parole or probation. And reports of child abuse 
have soared among Indians in recent years, even as that problem 
seemed to ease elsewhere in the population.

	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Allen Iverson scored 32 points, including 15  
in the first quarter, as the Philadelphia 76ers beat the Atlanta 
Hawks 78-70 today. Iverson also tied his career high with six 
steals. Steve Smith scored 14 points for the Hawks, who shot just 
34 percent. Alan Henderson had 12 points and eight rebounds, and 
Dikembe Mutombo and Ed Gray had 11 points apiece. Mookie Blaylock 
added 10 points and seven assists.

<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Jeff Gordon won his second Daytona  
500 today as he barely held off Dale Earnhardt in a thrilling, 
late-race shootout in NASCAR's premier event. The 27-year-old 
Gordon, who also won the race in 1997, took the lead with a 
breathtaking move 11 laps from the finish. Rusty Wallace finished 
third and Mike Skinner came in fourth.

<HEADLINE> Miami Heat Sign Blue Edwards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The Miami Heat, seeking another scorer after  
injuries to Jamal Mashburn and Voshon Lenard, signed former Utah 
and Vancouver swingman Blue Edwards on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Miami also placed Mashburn on injured reserve with a deep knee  
bruise and waived center Amal McCaskill from the injured list. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the contract were not disclosed. Under terms of the new  
collective bargaining agreement, though, the Heat could pay Edwards 
the pro-rated portion of the nine-year veteran minimum of $850,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards' signing had been expected for several days, but Heat  
officials first wanted to make sure the broken right hand he 
suffered in December during a pickup game had sufficiently healed. 
</P>
<P>
	``My goal is just to come off the bench and be productive,''  
said Edwards, who has an 11.0 career scoring average. Last season, 
he averaged 10.8 points for Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
	The Heat have been seeking an additional scorer with both  
Mashburn and Lenard -- who combined to average 27.7 points last 
season -- out for at least half of the NBA's abbreviated 50-game 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	Mashburn is expected to miss 4-6 weeks after hurting the knee in  
a Feb. 7 win over New York. Lenard underwent surgery Friday to 
insert a rod into the stress fracture in his left leg; he could 
miss nearly the entire regular season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't have another legitimate two-guard that can catch and  
shoot, that can play pick-and-roll offense, that can post-up, that 
can defend. And that's what Blue can do,'' Miami coach Pat Riley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The addition of Edwards, 6-foot-4 and 229 pounds, also can help  
the Heat with ballhandling. Veteran Terry Porter was signed during 
training camp as a backup to point guard Tim Hardaway, but has been 
playing shooting guard because of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	The Heat still must release two players by Thursday evening,  
when active rosters will be reduced from 14 to 12.

<HEADLINE> On-Line Site Aids Blind Studies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. (AP) -- By running his hands across a  
scientific graph, Cary Supalo is able to take in by touch what 
others take for granted -- the full-color diagrams and charts that 
illustrate science textbooks. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, as the blind Purdue University student read the  
Braille on his textbooks, the text was accompanied with a simple 
tag: illustration omitted. 
</P>
<P>
	But for the last two years, Purdue has provided more than text.  
A program called Tactile Access to Education for Visually Impaired 
Students has generated thousands of scientific diagrams with puffy, 
raised lines and Braille labels to aid blind students. 
</P>
<P>
	``As they say, a picture's worth a thousand words,'' said  
Supalo, who is pursuing double major in chemistry and 
communications. ``From an access standpoint, it's made my life a 
lot easier.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now blind students at other colleges can also ``view'' the  
diagrams, thanks to an Internet program that allows other schools 
to replicate the drawings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's exciting, it's breaking frontiers,'' said TAEVIS director  
Sue Wilder. ``It's really challenging the system that currently 
exists.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until the early 1980s, blind students were strongly discouraged  
from pursuing science careers, Wilder said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were simply told it's too visual, it's too expensive, go  
take a liberal arts course,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eventually, a special Braille code was developed that eased the  
translation of mathematical and scientific information. Textbooks 
could be translated, but not the illustrations. 
</P>
<P>
	``That information was not being transmitted to the blind  
student,'' Wilder said. 
</P>
<P>
	Until two years ago, when a special type of paper hit the  
market, backed with plastic and coated with a heat-sensitive 
chemical. A drawing is printed onto the paper in black ink, then 
the paper is run through a heater, what people in the TAEVIS office 
call ``the toaster.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The heat causes the black ink lines, Braille letters and  
markings to bubble up, leaving a raised image. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really gives the blind student, the Braille readers, equal  
access to the material,'' Wilder said. ``This way, the students get 
to absorb the data, analyze it and draw their own conclusions, 
which is a more complete learning experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, providing such a service is time consuming and costly.  
Purdue's TAEVIS office is bustling with nine full-time employees 
and five part-time students working with 20 computers and a $40,000 
Braille embosser. 
</P>
<P>
	Purdue pays $500,000 a year for the service, which assists its  
three blind students and one student in Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is a huge expense for schools like Purdue,'' Wilder said.  
``For small schools, it's an expense that's quite substantial.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's where TAEVIS Online comes in. The Web site costs less  
than $100 to subscribe to and allows schools anywhere to download 
the more than 2,500 images TAEVIS has in its library. Each download 
costs about $2. 
</P>
<P>
	The special paper is about 70 cents a sheet and the ``toaster''  
costs less than $1,500. Wilder believes that schools that don't 
have the time or resources to redraw scientific diagrams can access 
this site and save time and money. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why should anyone else have to draw it once we've drawn it?''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Once Supalo graduates this spring, he plans to pursue a  
doctorate in inorganic chemistry. Wherever he winds up pursuing his 
advanced degree, he believes the TAEVIS program will continue to 
help out. 
</P>
<P>
	``I get the feeling that I will be using it in the near  
future,'' he said. ``It's nice to know that I don't have to worry 
about whether I can get a picture in Braille.''

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Lauren Bacall doesn't have many nice things to  
say about Hollywood, even though she recently finished filming her 
first television miniseries there. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I don't like about it is the general mentality,'' she  
said of the show-biz culture. ``They ignore accomplishment. They 
don't understand talent. It's only about money.'' 
</P>

``Too Rich: The Secret Life of Doris Duke,'' told Sunday's Daily 
News that she would have gladly taken a job in a minseries before 
now, only it was never offered. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> De La Hoya Finally Earns Respect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Respect. Oscar De La Hoya earned it by  
outpointing Ike Quartey, then said he gave his opponent too much of 
it in the fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've just got to go out there and fight,'' the WBC  
welterweight champion said of his split-decision victory Saturday 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya, who had said Quartey would be the toughest test of  
his career, got up from a sixth-round knockdown, won the last three 
rounds on all three cards and knocked down the challenger and 
almost stopped him in the 12th round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I beat one of the best in the world out there,'' said De La  
Hoya, now 30-0, with 24 knockouts. Quartey of Ghana, a former WBA 
champion who was stripped of that title, lost for the first time 
against 34 wins, 29 by knockouts, and one draw. 
</P>
<P>
	There was talk of a rematch, as there always is after a good  
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to fight all the best fighters out there,'' De La Hoya  
said. ``If I beat the best, then I'll give him a rematch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A fight between De La Hoya and the winner of a bout between  
unbeaten IBF champion Felix Trinidad and Pernell Whitaker on 
Saturday in Madison Square Garden would be attractive. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker lost a disputed decision to De La Hoya in 1997. The WBA  
champion is James Page. Several good super lightweights also could 
move up to challenge De La Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
	First, De La Hoya is expected to defend against Oba Carr. Carr  
won a 10-round decision over Frankie Randall on the pay-per-view 
card in the Thomas &AMP; Mack Center. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the sixth-round knockdown that came after De La Hoya had  
dropped Quartey earlier in the round, De La Hoya said: ``I thought, 
`Hey, I'm going to get right back up and stay in this fight.' I'm 
not a quitter. 
</P>
<P>
	``He showed tremendous heart,'' said Gil Clancy, De La Hoya's  
co-trainer. ``That's what won it for him. He spent the entire fight 
fighting Quartey's fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I won the fight,'' Quartey said. ``I did everything.  
He did nothing. He came to survive. That's all he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya, however, appeared to have won most of the close  
rounds by being busier. 
</P>
<P>
	After 11 rounds, De La Hoya trailed by three points on one card,  
and led by two and one on the other two. 
</P>
<P>
	``Robert (Alcazar, the co-trainer) told him to go out and look  
good in this round,'' Clancy said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Truly, I thought I was in total control,'' De La Hoya said.  
``I never thought I had to come back dramatically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whatever he thought, De La Hoya took Alcazar's advice. He  
knocked down Quartey with a left hook early in the round, then 
trapped him on the ropes and landed a barrage of 17 punches. 
Quartey punched back enough to keep the fight from being stopped. 
</P>
<P>
	All three judges gave De La Hoya a two-point round, making the  
final tallies 115-114 for Quartey and 115-112 and 115-113 for De La 
Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press card favored De La Hoya 116-111.

<HEADLINE> Independent Counsel May Be History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers from both parties saw almost no  
chance Sunday for survival of the Independent Counsel Act, which 
provided the framework for Kenneth Starr's investigation of 
President Clinton, when it comes up for renewal this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This law needs to terminate. I don't want it to be amended. I  
want it to be ended,'' Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said on CNN's 
``Late Edition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The act passed in 1978 as the post-Watergate Congress sought a  
means to ensure that politics did not interfere when the president, 
his cabinet and other senior officials are investigated for 
wrongdoing. It expires June 30 unless Congress and the president 
approve its reauthorization. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno, at the urging of Republicans, has  
seven times asked for the naming of an independent counsel to 
investigate administration officials, most notably Starr who has 
pursued President Clinton's connections to Whitewater, Travelgate, 
the FBI files and finally his affair with Monica Lewinsky, which 
led to Clinton's impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats contend that Starr abused the almost unlimited powers  
the act gives an independent counsel, while Republicans have joined 
Democrats in protesting the amount of money spent. Starr has spent 
more than $40 million over more than four years investigating the 
president. Another independent counsel, Donald Smaltz, took four 
years and $17 million looking into corruption charges against 
former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy. Espy was acquitted of those 
charges, and Clinton was found innocent of impeachment charges that 
grew out of Starr's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also are unhappy about past independent counsel  
activities during GOP administrations and about Reno's decisions 
not to seek independent counsels for possible Democratic campaign 
fund-raising violations. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing we can do in this Congress is not extend the life of  
the independent counsel statute. It was a post-Watergate liberal 
notion, and it was a disaster,'' said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, 
D-N.Y., on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's either going to be rewritten significantly, or it will be  
allowed to lapse. In all likelihood the latter,'' agreed Sen. Don 
Nickles of Oklahoma, Republican whip in the Senate, on ABC's ``This 
Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House Chief of Staff John Podesta, also on NBC, said that  
while the White House has taken no final position, ``It's virtually 
hopeless to try to fix it, I think, without some major, major 
revisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American Bar Association, which helped craft the Independent  
Counsel Act two decades ago, last week voted 384-49 to end its 
support for the law. ``It was designed to remove politics from the 
investigation of public officials,'' said Philip Anderson, who 
heads the 400,000-member group. ``The majority of Americans would 
say that politics has not been removed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congress is likely to hold hearings on the future of the act in  
the coming weeks, but McConnell said in the end lawmakers could 
kill it just by failing to act on its renewal. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that the country handled its two biggest scandals,  
Teapot Dome in the 1920s and Watergate in the 1970s, without an 
independent counsel. ``I think the existing system can handle 
scandal quite well,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Fans Bid Farewell to Gardens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- From tears to belligerence, emotions ran high at  
Maple Leaf Gardens on Saturday night as sometimes raucous fans 
gathered for the historic arena's final NHL game. 
</P>
<P>
	Outside, hordes of revelers pushed and shoved their way into the  
yellow stone building as a lone trumpeter played the funeral march. 
</P>
<P>
	Scalpers commanded $600 for the worst seats in the house and  
nobody batted an eye. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is history,'' said Phillip DuPre, who shelled out $1,500  
for a pair of mid-level seats for himself and his 13-year-old son, 
Jon. ``I grew up watching the Leafs here. No price is too high for 
tonight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Inside, fans wept openly and fights broke out over game  
programs, which sold out long before the puck was dropped for the 
Maple Leafs and Chicago Blackhawks to end NHL hockey's 68-year 
history in the building. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ladies and gentlemen, just bear with us for a few minutes --  
please!'' urged program vendor Rich Bremner, clearly alarmed as 
hundreds of people crowded into a corner of the arena seeking $10 
glossy game programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It never changes here,'' complained bystander Beth Kerchove,  
who waited in line for 20 minutes to buy a corned beef sandwich. 
``They never accommodate their fans and they never had enough 
programs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a shoving match broke out in line, a policeman beseeched the  
zealous fans to calm down. 
</P>
<P>
	``Please, we don't want anybody to get hurt here,'' he said with  
a nervous smile. ``We're all here to have a good time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some customers grew belligerent when they were told they could  
only buy one program each. Worried vendors tried to reassure them 
that programs were still for sale at city book stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the end it got a little bit tense,'' said constable Peter  
Phillipo of Toronto police, who often works at the Maple Leafs 
games. ``But we don't anticipate many problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As the nostalgic post-game show was still going on, thousands of  
fans encircled two city blocks, shut down for the celebration. They 
played street hockey, waved flags, cheered and chanted.

<P>
	Two teen boys caught up in the revelry, scaled the Maple Leaf  
Gardens sign and did a little dance. They came down after five 
minutes and were not caught by police. 
</P>
<P>
	``These people are like fleas on the big dog,'' said constable  
Tim McMannus, one of a line of cops circling the crowds' perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
	The home team's 6-2 loss to the Chicago Blackhawks didn't seem  
to diminish the spirit of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bad game, good party,'' said Peter Florian, who had painted  
blue leafs on his face and dressed for the occasion in a goalie's 
mask and blue and white team paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
	A hush fell over the crowd just before game time.  
</P>
<P>
	Ellie Reason, 86, began to weep as announcer Paul Morris noted  
that it was the last night for the Maple Leafs and the Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
	``I came here the first year it opened, in 1931,'' said Reason,  
decked out in a Maple Leafs jersey. ``But I was from Quebec, so I 
was a Canadiens fan. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fans used to yell at me when I cheered for my team, and  
call me a swamp singer: a frog. But my husband brought me over to 
the other side.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reason's son, Jim, said he bought pricey tickets for himself and  
his mother because he had such fond childhood memories of attending 
games with his parents. 
</P>
<P>
	``A hot dog and a soda and I was happy in the greys (the worst  
seats in the house),'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Beneath rows of black-and-white photos of former Maple Leafs  
greats in the arena's hallways, vendors hawked T-shirts, 
sweatshirts, collector's plates and silver and bronze commemorative 
coins. 
</P>
<P>
	T-shirts reading ``I was there for the last game, February 13,  
1999'' were selling fast, said vendor Ernie Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're cleaned right out,'' Williams said at mid-game. ``But we  
anticipated this. We set up at 10 a.m. and we've been going all 
day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the audience, thousands of fans wearing Maple Leaf colors  
resembled an uneven blue-and-white patchwork quilt. They sang 
songs, snapped photos and cheered at the most minor of plays. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody's talking to each other,'' marveled Maureen  
Bellmore, 27. ``It's crazy, everybody's sharing in the moment, 
everybody's so pumped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bellmore was particularly happy that the Maple Leafs were  
leaving the fabled hockey shrine on a positive note. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're doing incredible this year, which makes this night all  
the more exciting.''

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stocks Rise / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks rose early Monday after Japan's  
central bank cut the country's already record-low interest rates 
Friday in a bid to end a dogged recession. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar was lower against the yen.  
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 37.30 points,  
or 0.27 percent, to 14,010.99 points after 30 minutes of trading. 
On Friday, the index rose 21.29 points, or 0.15 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan announced that it was cutting a key interest  
rate in an effort to cap a surge in long-term rates and revive 
corporate borrowing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bank of Japan's policy board voted to lower its target for  
overnight call money -- the rate banks charge each other for 
unsecured short-term loans -- to and all-time low of 0.15 percent 
from 0.25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But the rise is stocks remained small Friday morning as many  
investors wondered how much the rate cut would do to help the 
Japanese economy, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section rose 1.11 points, or 0.10 percent, to 1,090.64. The 
TOPIX rose 6.44 points, or 0.59 percent, Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Many financial stocks rose after the government gave preliminary  
approval on Friday for ailing banks to receive a second wave of 
public funds to beef up their operations. 
</P>
<P>
	But technology shares were weaker in line with a fall in hi-tech  
shares in New York on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency trading, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 113.96 yen in  
morning trading, down 0.36 yen from its level Friday in Tokyo and 
below its New York level of 114.21. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar had risen against the yen late Friday after the Bank  
of Japan's rate cut, but fell back as doubts emerged about its 
impact. 
</P>
<P>
	Lower interest rates make Japan's currency less attractive  
relative to the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	The euro was traded at 128.54 yen, unchanged from late Friday in  
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government bond remained  
unquoted early Monday. The bond finished Friday at a yield of 2.080 
percent and price of 97.81 yen.

<HEADLINE> Lakers' Signing of Rodman Imminent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- The Los Angeles Lakers expect to have  
Dennis Rodman signed to a contract before Tuesday night's game 
against the Charlotte Hornets, according to a source close to the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	The source, who spoke late Sunday on the condition of anonymity,  
said he expected Rodman to sign a contract ``late tonight, tomorrow 
or Tuesday at the latest.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If that's the case, Rodman could be in uniform against the  
Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, the NBA's leading rebounder for the past seven seasons,  
didn't attend the Lakers' 101-99 loss to Indiana on Sunday, 
although he reportedly had tickets to the game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers, who have started the season a disappointing 3-3,  
first expressed an interest in Rodman two weeks ago when he met 
with owner Jerry Buss for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers can only offer Rodman the veterans' minimum of $1  
million -- prorated to $600,000 for this lockout-shortened season -- 
but he'll also earn $3 million from his endorsement contract with 
Converse. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lakers' frontline suffered a blow Sunday when forward Robert  
Horry was hospitalized with chest pains shortly before the start of 
the game against the Indiana Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	Horry was diagnosed as having an irregular heartbeat. It was not  
immediately known how long he would be sidelined. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, who turns 38 in May, has played on five of the last 10  
NBA champions, including the last three with the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	His career scoring average is just 7.5 points, but he is one of  
the greatest rebounders in league history with a 13.2 average. No 
other player ever won seven straight rebounding titles. 
</P>
<P>
	After Michael Jordan's retirement last month, the Bulls opted  
not to pursue Rodman. He flirted with the idea of signing with 
Orlando or Miami, but both teams backed off. 
</P>
<P>
	Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal has said repeatedly he supports  
the acquisition of Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	With Rodman's history, it's impossible to assume anything is  
certain. As far as his erratic behavior is concerned, Lakers coach 
Del Harris said if Rodman becomes a member of the team, he won't 
prejudge him. 
</P>
<P>
	``You really don't know a player until you've coached him in  
this league,'' Harris said Saturday. ``I think you're better off 
not listening to the rumors and everything and just finding out 
ways to work with the people that you do have. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are always ways to work with people. You just have to  
find the different communicating methods that are required, or in 
some cases non-communicating methods that are required and go from 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked before Sunday's game if Rodman would be the missing  
link for the Lakers, Harris said: ``We certainly have done well so 
far without Dennis. You never want to say you can't get someplace 
if you don't have somebody you don't have.''

<HEADLINE> Ski Accident Survivors Seek Justice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC BEACH, N.C. (AP) -- Walking barefoot in the white sand  
by the gently rolling Atlantic surf, Marina Renkewitz tries to 
forget for a moment why she is here. 
</P>
<P>
	She and her husband of 26 years, Uwe, had made plans to visit  
the United States this year from their home in Germany. Uwe, a 
machine shop supervisor with a passion for sport and nature, had 
always wanted to visit Yellowstone National Park. And he loved the 
beach as much as the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was interested in everything beautiful in the world,'' says  
Mrs. Renkewitz, bending down to pick up a pink-speckled sea shell. 
</P>
<P>
	But her visit to the United States is anything but a holiday.  
</P>
<P>
	When a U.S. Marine Corps jet sliced through the cable of an  
Italian ski gondola a year ago, Uwe was killed, along with the 
Renkewitzes' 23-year-old daughter, Mandy, and her fiance. With her 
surviving daughter, Sindy, Mrs. Renkewitz has joined family members 
of other victims who came to Camp Lejeune for the court-martial of 
the pilot, Capt. Richard Ashby. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was hoping that Ashby would look me in the eyes,'' says  
Sindy, a 20-year-old college student. ``But in the courtroom he 
just ignores the people behind him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a break in the trial last week, Ashby's mother, Carol  
Anderson, responded that her son does not mean to be cold. ``Rich 
cares very much about the victims and their families,'' she said. 
``I pray every day for the families.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby faces 20 counts of involuntary manslaughter, destruction  
of property and dereliction of duty for allegedly flying his EA-6B 
Prowler anti-radar plane too low and too fast during a training 
mission in Cavalese, Italy, on Feb. 3, 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Ashby says the gondola cable sliced by the plane was not on his  
flight maps and claims his instruments tricked him into believing 
he was flying higher. His navigator, Capt. Joseph Schweitzer, is to 
go on trial next month. 
</P>
<P>
	The dozens of family members from Belgium, Germany, Italy and  
Poland were not here to testify. They came to draw attention to the 
fact that, while the U.S. government has paid $20 million to repair 
the Alpine ski lift, the victims' survivors have been left to sue 
through the Italian courts in a process that could take up to 10 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's bad that machinery is worth more than a life,'' says  
Sindy Renkewitz. ``We've lost people we loved.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The family lost an anchor when Uwe and Mandy died, Marina  
Renkewitz says, sitting on a sofa in a beachfront condominium 
provided by the government, miles away from the noise of Camp 
Lejeune's artillery practice and circling helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
	Uwe loved hiking, skiing and all outdoor sports. He and the  
other Germans in the gondola were all part of a local sports club. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also enjoyed subtler pleasures. Like many German  
families, the Renkewitzes had a small country garden where they 
grew potatoes and strawberries, and tended cherry and apple trees. 
Above all, he loved his 50 exotic birds, many of which he had 
raised from hatchlings. 
</P>
<P>
	``He lived for that,'' Mrs. Renkewitz says. ``He could spend  
hours on that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mandy was a master at interior decorating, her sister says. She  
and her fiance, Michael Potschke, 24, who both worked at the 
regional employment office, had fixed up the former stable where 
they lived. 
</P>
<P>
	``They wanted to marry in the fall, and by December they  
expected to have a child,'' Sindy says, fiddling with a tiny gold 
and diamond ring, Mandy's, on her finger now. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Renkewitz wears another of Mandy's rings. Her husband's  
etched wedding band is on her left middle finger. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not much remains for us except this jewelry,'' she says, her  
blue eyes welling with tears. 
</P>
<P>
	The Renkewitzes were not a wealthy family, but they were  
comfortable by the standards of the former East Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	``My father's job was pretty secure,'' says Sindy, a tall, thin  
woman with bleached-blond hair and her father's smiling brown eyes. 
``There was always enough extra money to go on vacation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Mrs. Renkewitz is left to pay the remaining six years'  
mortgage on her family's apartment. She and her daughter don't go 
to movies and restaurants. She has even sold the birds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was terribly painful to have to sell them,'' she says. ``I  
considered a long time whether I should take up the hobby and carry 
on for my husband.'' 
</P>
<P>
	John Eaves, an attorney representing the families of the seven  
German victims, has filed administrative claims against the U.S. 
government. But he and others are calling for a congressional 
appropriation like the one used to restore the Alpine ski resort. 
An attempt by U.S. Rep. Charles Robb, D-Va., to include $60 million 
for the families in that bill failed. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there had been one American on that gondola, we wouldn't be  
in this position,'' says C. Torrence Armstrong, attorney for the 
Belgians. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Renkewitz sometimes still dreams of the crushed gondola and  
the bloody snow. Had she not been souvenir shopping, she might also 
have been on the ski lift. 
</P>
<P>
	She used to wish she had been.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've had those thoughts, that I should have been in there,  
too,'' she says. ``But then I remember that I have another daughter 
at home.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Wine Grape Harvest 2nd Largest Ever / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- California's 1998 wine grape harvest was  
the second largest on record -- but only because acreage was up 
substantially. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Department of Agriculture reports that production was  
down 13 percent from the 1997 record of 2.9 million tons. But 
winemakers said quality was very high for the 2.5 million tons of 
grapes crushed last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole year was full of angst,'' said Gladys Horiuchi,  
spokeswoman for the San Francisco-based Wine Institute. ``The bud 
break started a bit late and the harvest started a bit late. People 
were joking they'd be harvesting around Christmas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blame it -- as usual -- on El Nino. Experts said 1998's torrential  
winter rains in the nation's leading wine-producing state stalled 
buds for about a month and caused problems for pollination. On the 
other side of the weather picture, a warm October helped accelerate 
the harvest. 
</P>
<P>
	Horiuchi said the season produced lower yields per acre, but  
more acres were being harvested as more vineyards came into 
maturity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because there was a smaller yield per acre and the grapes were  
on the vine a long time, it really concentrated the flavors,'' she 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because of the late, slow-paced vintage, the reds are deeply  
colored with softer tannins and lots of fruit,'' said Michael 
Martini, winemaker at Napa Valley's Louis M. Martini Winery in St. 
Helena. ``This is a very good year, except the crop level for 
Northern California was slightly below normal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Stutz, winemaker at Mirassou Vineyards in San Jose, said the  
winery's Chardonnay, Pinot Blanc and Pinot Noir will be exceptional 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The '98 vintage may prove to be one of the best of the  
decade,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	At 1.32 million tons, down 10 percent from 1997, red varieties  
accounted for the largest share of all wine grapes crushed. White 
varieties dropped 17 percent from 1997 to 1.19 million tons. 
</P>
<P>
	California winegrowers received an average price of $581.83 per  
ton of grapes in 1998, 3 percent less than the previous year. 
However, in Napa Valley the average price per ton for Cabernet 
Sauvignon was $2,252, up from $2,005 in 1997, a 12 percent 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
	The priciest white variety was Napa Valley Chardonnay, which  
cost an average of $1,841 per ton in 1998, a 6 percent increase 
over 1997. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	FORT VALLEY, Ga. (AP) -- Chop Evans, who lost 60 percent of his  
peach crop last year in a late frost, hopes for help from a 
chemical new to Georgia farmers as well as better weather. 
</P>
<P>
	After weather that has been a bit too warm, the chemical known  
as Dormex may help the state's peach crop this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Dormex recently was approved for use in Georgia by the  
Environmental Protection Agency and the state Department of 
Agriculture. The chemical regulates plant growth, helping to pace 
the development of peach trees and overcome adverse weather. 
</P>
<P>
	Evans, who has operated his 2,400 acres of Peach and Macon  
county farms for 24 years, said his fruit would benefit from a few 
weeks of temperatures between 30 and 45 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I could write a prescription for temperature, that's what  
I'd ask for,'' Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
	Georgia is the nation's third largest peach-producing state,  
with a crop worth $30 million annually. 
</P>
<P>
	Kathryn Taylor, a University of Georgia horticulturist, says  
that when warm weather causes peach blossoms to mature faster than 
usual, the trees' leaves don't grow as quickly. Without enough 
leaves, the tree lacks leaf-produced carbohydrates that fuel the 
growth of peaches. When cold weather stalls the flowers' growth, 
the leaves have the chance to catch up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without chilling hours, there will not be enough leaf  
production to support the fruit load,'' Ms. Taylor said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dormex, an environmentally safe chemical, brings leaf production  
up to speed with flower production but does not significantly alter 
the normal bloom date, she said.

<HEADLINE> First Lady Might Run for NY Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With the impeachment trial over, first lady  
Hillary Rodham Clinton will give serious thought to running for the 
Senate from New York next year, senior White House officials said 
Sunday. Democrats and Republicans alike predicted a terrific race 
if she steps in. 
</P>
<P>
	A number of people ``have been really urging her to run, and I  
think she wants to hear them out,'' White House Chief of Staff John 
Podesta said on ABC's ``This Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of people in New York who think she would be a  
great senator and are very excited about the prospect that she 
would represent them,'' added White House communications director 
Ann Lewis on CNN's ``Late Edition.'' ``I do think she would win,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Talk has been circulating for several months of prospects that  
Mrs. Clinton would run for the seat to be vacated when Democratic 
Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan leaves the Senate in 2000 after 24 
years in office. 
</P>
<P>
	Moynihan, interviewed on NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' said ``she'd  
be welcome and she'd win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said New York could probably use some of her ``magnificent,  
young, bright, able, Illinois-Arkansas enthusiasm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``She's going to be very deliberative about this. This is going  
to be a major life change,'' said Democratic Sen. Frank Lautenberg 
from neighboring New Jersey, adding ``I think she would be one 
terrific candidate,'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be an incredible race,'' said Sen. John McCain,  
R-Ariz., of a possible matchup with New York's Republican Mayor 
Rudy Giuliani. ``One thing I know about Rudy Giuliani, he'll tangle 
with anybody,'' he said on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., who is in charge of money-raising  
for GOP senatorial campaigns, said on CNN that Mrs. Clinton's entry 
into a race against Giuliani ``would make this a titanic struggle 
of two very popular figures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton is expected to be very much in the public eye now  
that the impeachment trial is over. She is going to travel around 
the country promoting her husband's Social Security and Medicare 
proposals, make another ``spring break'' mission overseas, probably 
with daughter Chelsea, and take her ``America's treasures'' tour to 
the West to promote historic preservation. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsweek, in its edition appearing on newsstands Monday, said  
that during the impeachment trial Mrs. Clinton played an active 
role in her husband's defense, although she did not attend staff 
meetings. It said her focus was on constitutional issues and it was 
her ideas to bring constitutional scholars before the House 
Judiciary Committee.

<HEADLINE> Some Politicians Already Stumping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAMERON PARK, Calif. (AP) -- Stores in a nearby mall are still  
selling 1999 calendars, but Bernie Richter is well into his fourth 
month of full-time campaigning for a seat in the 2001 California 
state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	This sunny February day, he logs another 270 miles on his  
cream-colored Ford Victoria in 10 1/2 hours on the campaign trail. 
</P>
<P>
	He starts the day charging up supporters in a meeting near the  
state Capitol in Sacramento. At noon, he's at the Rotary Club in 
the upscale suburb of Cameron Park, where the homes are as big as 
motels. 
</P>
<P>
	Two hours later, he drops in on a columnist for the newspaper  
with the largest circulation in his district. At 3 p.m., there is 
another meeting with potential supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential hopefuls aren't the only candidates whose campaigns  
now stretch over two or more years. Candidates for Congress, the 
state Legislature and even local offices are fanning out across 
California every day, raising money, hunting for endorsements and 
making speeches. 
</P>
<P>
	Richter's likely opponent, Rico Oller, was just elected in  
November to his second term in the state Assembly. That's a 
full-time job, so he can't match Richter's campaign schedule. 
Still, Oller says he puts in at least 20 hours a week campaigning. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm doing something virtually every evening. Most weekends I  
have several things going on. And when I'm not doing that, I'm on 
the phone calling people,'' Oller said. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the same all across the state, from Assembly seats to  
presidential runs. 
</P>
<P>
	Why is everyone campaigning so early?  
</P>
<P>
	``The answer is the population is so diverse and so unfocused on  
politics that you have to do anything you can to raise your 
visibility, and you have to do it for as long as possible before an 
election,'' said Democratic campaign consultant Jeff Raimundo. 
</P>
<P>
	Two recent changes in law -- term limits and the early  
presidential primary -- have only increased pressure to start 
campaigns earlier and earlier, said Republican consultant Richard 
Temple. 
</P>
<P>
	Term limits lengthen campaigns, Temple says, because new  
candidates who are not well known need more time to build their 
political base, raise money and introduce themselves to voters, 
even if they already hold or have held some other elected office. 
</P>
<P>
	The shift of next year's primary from June to March -- a move to  
give California more clout in picking presidential nominees -- has 
an impact all the way down to local Senate and Assembly races, 
since the Legislature also advanced the date for all state and 
federal offices to avoid the cost of two primaries. 
</P>
<P>
	That moves up the filing date for the March 7, 2000, primary to  
October. An even earlier date -- June 30 -- is when campaign 
contribution statements are due. So fund raising must begin 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're talking $30,000 to $50,000 to look credible,'' Temple  
said -- and that is just a start on the $100,000 to $500,000 or more 
required to win a California legislative or congressional race. 
</P>
<P>
	For voters, however, it seems as if the last campaign just ended  
and it is far too early to think about another one. 
</P>
<P>
	Rotary forbids campaign speeches, so Richter's speech is devoted  
to his personal evolution from Democrat to Republican, a reference 
to his years in the state Assembly, and a longer description of his 
role in the repeal of racial preferences in state contracts, jobs 
and college admissions. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, Richter says, ``It was a terrific day. We made some  
good contacts, good contacts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``What time are we starting tomorrow, George?'' he asks campaign  
manager George Osborn, before heading home to Chico.

<HEADLINE> Earnhardt, Gordon Dueled to the End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- Dale Earnhardt gave Jeff Gordon a  
push just when he needed it most. 
</P>
<P>
	The strategy backfired -- and Earnhardt, of all people, should  
have known better at the Daytona 500. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt chose Gordon as his partner in a late-race move to the  
front that set up a thrilling showdown Sunday in NASCAR's biggest 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	A few laps later, The Intimidator had learned his lesson -- and  
seen his chance for a second straight Daytona 500 victory lost in 
the exhaust of the Kid's steadfast driving and dominating car. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was trying all I could do to get to the 24,'' Earnhardt said  
of the final dash for the title. 
</P>
<P>
	``His car was pretty strong off the corners. If I could have  
just got to him in the corner, I might could have got under him, 
but I just couldn't get there. I got beat.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sure, but what a way to go down.  
</P>
<P>
	The drama began with 10 laps remaining, when Gordon slid under  
leader Rusty Wallace heading toward the first turn. He then 
squeezed past Ricky Rudd's lapped car, avoiding a crash by about a 
foot. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt's teammate, Mike Skinner, moved alongside Wallace on  
the outside and they drove three-wide into turn three. 
</P>
<P>
	With Earnhardt bumping Gordon from the back to help him get by,  
Gordon came out in front at the flagstand. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was definitely bumping me back there and I wanted him to,''  
Gordon said. ``I was saying, `Come on, hit me harder.' He wasn't 
hitting me hard enough as far as I was concerned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A few laps later, Earnhardt made a move and racing fans got an  
exciting duel seen all too seldom during a pair of great careers. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though we battled for a (series) championship in '95, we  
really didn't get to have many tight battles all the way to the 
finish,'' Gordon said. ``I really can't think of a better way to do 
it than here at the Daytona 500.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once it became a two-man race, Gordon set the pace, slowing and  
speeding at the perfect times, keeping just the right amount of air 
between their cars to prevent Earnhardt from using the draft to 
slingshot past him. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnhardt's best hope would have been to get a bump from  
Skinner, but he was in fourth, pinned behind rookie Kenny Irwin. 
Asked if he could have used Skinner's help, Earnhardt snapped. 
</P>
<P>
	``How do you take a car out from between us and get (Skinner)  
behind me,'' he said. ``It's not like he can say, `Hey, I'm moving 
up,' and just drive over the other guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the final lap, Earnhardt zigged in, zagged out, zigged in  
again, then made one desperate lunge at Gordon before the finish 
line. 
</P>
<P>
	Each time he tried to get by, Gordon blocked him. Only a  
quarter-mile after the race ended did the seven-time Winston Cup 
winner catch up, giving a victory-lap nudge to congratulate him. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as I'm concerned, especially at Daytona, Dale is so  
good,'' Gordon said. ``He knows the air very, very well. And he 
knows how to make passes without getting help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he had given it to exactly the wrong guy.  
</P>
<P>
	So, there was no celebration for Earnhardt, no using his car to  
carve circles in the grass, the way he did last year when he 
finally took the only major championship to elude him over his 
25-year career. 
</P>
<P>
	And there was no repeat, a la John Elway, the Denver Broncos  
quarterback who won two straight Super Bowls and inspired 
Earnhardt. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, it was his fifth second-place finish at Daytona, making  
him the all-time leader in that category, passing Cale Yarbrough. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were happy to get second, but we sure would love to be down  
there in Victory Lane,'' Earnhardt said. ``We've had a good week 
here. Everything worked good for us in the qualifying races and we 
had a good day here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also was one of the best finishes in the 41-year history of  
the race. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Earnhardt left thinking of one way it could have been  
even better.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Scandal Lingers for Many </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's not really over. Not for Hillary and  
Chelsea. Not for many others, either. There is a legacy of pain, 
anger, humiliation and embarrassment that endures from the yearlong 
scandal that grew out of President Clinton's affair with Monica 
Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Hillary Rodham Clinton and her daughter were devastated by the  
president's betrayal, left with sleepless nights and private agony, 
friends say. They try not to show their heartache publicly, but 
others, like former Sen. Dale Bumpers, describe a relationship that 
has been ``about as decimated as a family can get.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For staff and friends, there are huge legal bills to pay.  
Damaged reputations to be repaired. Shattered trusts and 
confidences to be soothed. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the president's top aides were furious that he lied to  
them, then expected them to defend his deception. Some considered 
quitting but stayed, mostly out of fidelity to the president's 
agenda. Or loyalty to the first lady. 
</P>
<P>
	The president recently acknowledged it had been a strain but  
said, ``I think we've come through the worst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For many people, it will take a long time to overcome the awful  
consequences of Clinton's misbehavior. 
</P>
<P>
	One White House official who left described the legal bills as  
``brutal.'' Not just for senior staff, either -- assistants, 
associates, friends outside the White House were subpoenaed as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
	The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there are  
mixed emotions among the staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are those who are deeply distressed,'' the official  
said. ``There are those who are a little disillusioned and hurt. 
There are also those who are the steadfast supporters and are deep 
believers in his agenda and what he is trying to do for the 
country. They see that with greatness can sometimes come 
weaknesses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, in a message to his staff Friday, said, ``The past year  
has been especially difficult for you. I know that my actions and 
the events they triggered have made your work even harder. For 
that, I am profoundly sorry. In all this, under the most 
extraordinary of circumstances, you never lost sight of your first 
obligation -- to serve the people of our nation. For that, I am 
profoundly grateful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of Clinton's aides blame not Clinton but Independent  
Counsel Kenneth Starr, believing he waged a personal vendetta 
against the president. 
</P>
<P>
	When the story broke a year ago, Clinton personally assured his  
Cabinet he had not had a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky. 
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Commerce Secretary William 
Daley, Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala and 
Education Secretary Richard Riley were sent out before the press to 
repeat Clinton's false denial. 
</P>
<P>
	The president apologized to them eight months later and admitted  
his deception. Shalala, Riley and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt 
bluntly questioned or confronted Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton adviser Paul Begala was described as taking it  
especially hard. But it was Begala who helped Clinton draft his 
address to the nation after he testified before the grand jury. 
Former spokesman Mike McCurry and aide George Stephanopoulos also 
have spoken harshly about Clinton's behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	Associates say Clinton confidante Bruce Lindsey probably wins  
top prize in legal bills, perhaps as much as $1 million. Former 
deputy chief of staff Evelyn Lieberman, who was suspicious about 
Lewinsky's interest in Clinton and forced her to leave the White 
House, also has huge legal expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	Lindsey said he hopes to get his bills paid by the government,  
since he was a target in Starr's investigation but was not 
indicted. ``It is a dubious honor to have been an actual target of 
Ken Starr, but having been a target and not indicted, the only 
advantage is the possibility of having to apply to the government 
to have them reimburse my legal fees,'' Lindsey said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said White House officials were able to negotiate cheaper  
attorney rates for some staff who needed legal help. 
</P>
<P>
	Associates marvel at the extraordinary loyalty of Harold Ickes.  
He was unceremoniously dropped from his job as deputy chief of 
staff after the 1996 election. But he was summoned back to help 
Clinton in the Lewinsky mess. He returned even though he had his 
own legal problems with Starr and Congress over campaign finances.

<HEADLINE> Independent Counsel May Be History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Independent Counsel Act that grew out of  
the Watergate scandal and culminated in Kenneth Starr's 
investigation of President Clinton is headed for extinction in 
June, lawmakers from both parties say. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing we can do in this Congress is not extend the life of  
the independent counsel statute. It was a post-Watergate liberal 
notion and it was a disaster,'' Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, 
D-N.Y., said Sunday on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This law needs to terminated. I don't want it to be amended. I  
want it to be ended,'' Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said on CNN's 
``Late Edition.'' He noted that he was one of 21 senators who had 
voted against reauthorizing the act after it lapsed in the early 
1990s. It will die on June 30 unless Congress and Clinton renew it. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress passed the law in 1978 as a post-Watergate means to  
ensure that investigations into the president, his Cabinet and 
other top officials would be free of politics. Under the act, the 
attorney general can ask a court to appoint an independent counsel 
when there is compelling evidence that a senior federal official is 
guilt of wrongdoing and a Justice Department investigation might 
give the appearance of a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
	But Republicans were displeased with the independent counsel's  
treatment of the Reagan administration during the Iran-Contra 
affair and Democrats have accused Starr of abusing his powers in 
his four-year, $40 million probe of the White House. It started 
with the Whitewater land deal and proceeded through the White House 
travel office firings, the handling of FBI files and finally the 
Monica Lewinsky affair. 
</P>
<P>
	Both parties have questioned the Office of Independent Counsel's  
nearly unlimited powers to spend money. Prosecutor Donald Smaltz 
spent $17 million in a four-year corruption case against former 
Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, who was acquitted of the charges 
six weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno has sought the appointment of seven  
independent counsels to investigate Clinton administration 
officials, but Republicans have criticized her refusal to use the 
act to look into Clinton's and Vice President Al Gore's possible 
links to alleged Democratic fund-raising violations. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's either going to be rewritten significantly or it will be  
allowed to lapse -- in all likelihood the latter,'' Senate 
Republican Whip Don Nickles of Oklahoma said on ABC's ``This 
Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congress is expected to hold hearings on the act in the coming  
weeks, but McConnell said Congress might simply kill it by failing 
to act on its reauthorization. 
</P>
<P>
	While the administration has not taken a final stance, ``it's  
virtually hopeless to try to fix it, I think, without some major, 
major revisions,'' White House chief of staff John Podesta said on 
NBC. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Bar Association, which helped craft the Independent  
Counsel Act two decades ago, decided to end support for the law in 
a 384-49 vote by its House of Delegates last week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was designed to remove politics from the investigation of  
public officials,'' said Philip Anderson, who heads the 
400,000-member organization of lawyers. ``The majority of Americans 
would say that politics has not been removed.''

<HEADLINE> Book: Mrs. Ramsey Tough With Cops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- JonBenet Ramsey's mother switched from  
charming to tough when challenged by a detective, leading police to 
believe she was ``capable of bringing harm to her daughter,'' 
author Lawrence Schiller writes in a new book on the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	``Perfect Murder -- Perfect Town,'' which will be released later  
this week, examines several facets of the crime, including 
differences between police and prosecutors, tabloid speculation and 
the culture of Boulder. 
</P>
<P>
	Schiller said an investigator found Patsy Ramsey to be charming  
and polite for the first two days of questioning in June. 
</P>
<P>
	But when police Detective Tom Haney pressed her on the third day  
-- suggesting he had evidence against her and telling her she had 
lied to him -- Mrs. Ramsey replied, ``Pal, you don't want to go 
there. Don't start that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The tougher the questions became, the tougher Patsy  
became...,'' Schiller said. ``Still, it was almost impossible to 
believe that she'd gone from being a normal mother, which until 
then she had given every indication of being, to being a murderer 
that night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schiller has written about other infamous crimes. He co-wrote  
``American Tragedy: The Uncensored Story of the Simpson Defense'' 
and helped O.J. Simpson write ``I Want to Tell You.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Hal Haddon, who represents JonBenet's parents, John and  
Patsy Ramsey, declined comment on the book. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has been arrested in the death of JonBenet, 6, who was  
found beaten and strangled in her family's Boulder home Dec. 26, 
1996.

<HEADLINE> Skier Kjus Earns Record Fifth Medal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	VAIL, Colo. (AP) -- Many casual followers of the World Cup ski  
circuit don't know how to pronounce his name, but they're learning 
fast. Lasse Kjus just can't be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus -- it's pronounced ``choos'' as in schuss, the German word  
for ``ski down a mountain fast'' -- made history in the World Alpine 
Ski Championships, which concluded with the men's slalom on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The unflappable Norwegian captured an unprecedented fifth medal  
in these championships, finishing runner-up in the slalom behind 
surprise winner Kalle Palander of Finland. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus, who became the fourth skier in history to win four medals  
in a world championship when he captured the giant slalom on 
Friday, set the record with the best slalom finish of his career. 
</P>
<P>
	Going a perfect 5-for-5, he also won gold in super-G and claimed  
silver in downhill and combined. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lasse is incredible,'' said bronze medalist Christian Mayer of  
Austria. ``Five medals in five starts -- what more can you say?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toni Sailer (1956), Jean-Claude Killy (1968) and Pirmin  
Zurbriggen (1987) all won four medals in a single championship. 
Only Kjus owns five. 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus, 28, tied teammate Kjetil Andre Aamodt and Luxembourg's  
Marc Girardelli for the most medals won in both world championships 
and Olympics -- 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how it felt to win five medals, Kjus said with a wide  
grin: ``It's a fantastic feeling. I can't believe it. It's 
incredible what has happened. I'm on a roll now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus insisted he was ``very happy'' with his second-place  
finish. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the second run, it was very chattery in the steep section  
and I didn't dare to give my all,'' he said. ``It was so close 
after the first run that I knew I could easily have ended up in 
fourth or fifth place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kjus led the first run of slalom, holding a slim margin of .19  
seconds over Mayer. Italy's Giorgio Rocca was third, .41 seconds 
off the pace. The unheralded Palander stood seventh, .78 seconds 
behind Kjus. 
</P>
<P>
	Palander, starting in the first seed of slalom for the first  
time after matching his previous career best with a sixth-place 
finish last month in Kitzbuhel, Austria, had the fastest second 
run. 
</P>
<P>
	His time of 49.92 seconds gave him a combined time of 1 minute,  
42.12 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Six subsequent racers couldn't dislodge him from the lead.  
</P>
<P>
	Kjus was .76 seconds faster than Palander through the  
intermediate clocking but lost time on the bottom of the steep, icy 
course, and his 50.81 second run -- only the eighth-fastest -- 
dropped him to second place at 1:42.23. 
</P>
<P>
	When Kjus' time was flashed on the scoreboard, a disbelieving  
Palander, 21, danced in the finish area, punching the air with his 
skis. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first Alpine medal ever for Finland, a country more  
noted for its Nordic skiing. 
</P>
<P>
	``I stood in the start for a minute and got myself together,''  
Palander said. ``When I came down, I thought, `OK, maybe a medal.' 
It must have been the last part where I made up all the time. I was 
hoping for top five. But a gold medal, unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mayer held on for the bronze in 1:42.25.

	Rocca was fourth in 1:42.33, followed by Austrian rookie  
Benjamin Raich in 1:42.55. 
</P>
<P>
	Austria's Thomas Stangassinger, who leads the World Cup slalom  
standings this season, charged from 12th place after the first run 
to finish sixth in 1:42.82. Aamodt rallied from 15th to finish 
seventh in 1:42.91. 
</P>

<P>
	In the final accounting, Austria led the way with 13 medals and  
Norway had nine. 
</P>
<P>
	The championships were a major disappointment for the German  
team. 
</P>
<P>
	The German women, in particular, were expected to win several  
medals because Hilde Gerg and Martina Ertl have been among the 
world's best skiers, ranking second and third, respectively, in the 
World Cup overall standings heading into the championships. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gerg's fourth-place finish in the combined was the best by  
any German. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States had only slim hopes for medaling in these  
championships, and failed to meet even those modest expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	Kristina Koznick of Burnsville, Minn., was among the favorites  
in the women's slalom, but she missed a gate only seconds into the 
first run of the event. 
</P>
<P>
	Hometown favorite Chad Fleischer had the best U.S. result --  
sixth in the men's super-G.

<HEADLINE> Lakers' Horry Has Chest Pains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INGLEWOOD, Calif. (AP) -- Los Angeles Lakers forward Robert Horry  
was diagnosed Sunday with an irregular heartbeat and will undergo 
additional tests at Centinela Hospital Medical Center on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Horry was hospitalized with chest pains shortly before the start  
of Sunday's game against the Indiana Pacers. The Lakers said he 
would be monitored and remain hospitalized overnight. There was no 
announcement concerning how long he'd be sidelined. 
</P>
<P>
	Horry, 28, is averaging 5.5 points and 5.8 rebounds. He was  
replaced in the starting lineup by Travis Knight. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Lakers center Shaquille O'Neal, listed as  
questionable because of a strained right groin, was in the starting 
lineup and had 19 points and nine rebounds in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
	O'Neal, the NBA's leading scorer, missed his team's most recent  
game, at Minnesota last Thursday night, due to the injury.

<HEADLINE> The Economics of a Nursing Career </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TROY, N.Y. (AP) -- Lisa Haaf wants a career taking care of the  
critically ill. 
</P>
<P>
	She has her nursing diploma, a biology degree to boot, and the  
zeal of a Florence Nightingale heading on to the battlefield. But 
this 27-year-old graduate is entering a profession whipsawed by 
managed care cuts, growing health needs of an aging population and 
warnings of nursing shortages. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it's true that a nursing shortage is occurring, hopefully  
it will also highlight the fact that we do good,'' said Haaf, who 
graduated from Russell Sage College north of Albany in December and 
moved to New Hampshire because of her husband's job. 
</P>
<P>
	A week into her job search, she had promising interviews at one  
hospital and a nursing home. Salaries ranged from $14,000 to 
$20,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would love something in the $16,000-$18,000 range, but  
salaries are not showing there's any strain as far as a shortage,'' 
Haaf said. ``They're not increasing wages up here yet to attract 
individuals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Just as in real estate, the key to success in nursing often  
turns on location. 
</P>
<P>
	South Carolina hospitals, where registered nurses make an  
average of $37,000 a year, are offering signing bonuses of up to 
$4,000 and sending recruiters to Northern states. Their 
counterparts in Massachusetts were flooded with applicants right 
out of school. 
</P>
<P>
	California reported nursing shortages a year ago, with nurses  
complaining that understaffing was a threat to patients. In New 
Hampshire, Haaf said only one of the four hospitals where she 
applied mentioned a shortage of nurses. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not all throughout the U.S.,'' said Beverly Malone,  
president of the American Nurses Association, who believes that 
shortages are more prevalent along the East and West coasts and in 
Chicago. Other industry observers said demand is greatest in the 
South and Southwest, where population growth is most dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is usually in the areas of specialities that we're feeling  
it first,'' Malone said. Signing bonuses and lots of newspaper 
help-wanted ads are the telltale signs. 
</P>
<P>
	A neonatal nurse in San Francisco can make $90,000 these days,  
Malone said, adding that solving shortage problems is complicated. 
``It's not just a matter of throwing dollars at the problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	To ensure that there are enough nurses in coming years, there  
needs to be more planning to recruit, train and sustain a nurse 
workforce, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The cyclical nature of nursing works like this:  
</P>
<P>
	When hospitals cut nursing jobs, many leave the profession and  
fewer students pursue nursing degrees. The demand then starts to 
build again. 
</P>
<P>
	But this shortage is different, Malone believes, and is  
complicated by several factors. 
</P>
<P>
	First, Malone said, managed care caused a reduction in nurses  
across the country and nurse duties were changed, prompting nurses 
to seek other professions. 
</P>
<P>
	Second, the American Association of Colleges of Nursing reports  
a 5.5 percent decline in entry-level enrollment in bachelor's 
degree programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Third, the baby boomer population is aging and people are going  
to live longer with chronic illnesses, meaning nurses will be 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, nurses are also aging. The average age of all  
registered nurses nationally was 44 in 1996. More than 62 percent 
of RNs were 40 or older. 
</P>
<P>
	There may be a significant demand for nurses in coming years,  
industry observers predict, because nurses begin leaving the 
profession in greater numbers in their 50s and dramatically in 
their 60s. 
</P>
<P>
	Researcher Carol Brewer believes warnings of shortages are an  
over-reaction. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've always had somewhat cyclical changes in the nursing  
labor supply,'' said Brewer, of the State University of New York at 
Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
	Talk of shortages is now the buzz among nurse industry  
executives, she conceded. But wages are another factor that 
influence nursing supply. If employers are just unwilling to pay 
the wages nurses expect, then it's not a real shortage, Brewer 
pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
	The average salary for all types of registered nurses was  
$42,071, according to a 1996 national survey conducted by the U.S. 
Bureau of Health Professions. For hospital staff nurses it was 
$40,097. 
</P>
<P>
	Nursing wages have been essentially flat since the early 1980s,  
according to Janet Coffman, associate director for workforce policy 
at the Center for the Health Professions at the University of 
California, San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Before declaring a shortage, the market needs time to respond  
with higher wages, Coffman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're seeing industry making some movement to address wages  
and working conditions,'' Coffman said, citing a California nurses 
contract with Kaiser Permanente last year that gave nurses more 
responsibility as well as a wage increase. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think a lot will depend on how industry decides it's going  
to value registered nurses,'' Coffman said of predicted shortages. 
``Does it value them enough to address their concerns and invest in 
them in the long run?''

<HEADLINE> Chairman Says BMW Not for Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- Germany's BMW AG on Sunday repeated it  
wasn't on the market, after a newspaper reported earlier General 
Motors Corp. planned to offer to buy the Bavarian company. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing to it,'' BMW's new chairman Joachim Milberg  
said at a meeting with the governor of Bavaria, Edmund Stoiber. 
</P>
<P>
	``BMW is and remains independent,'' Milberg said.  
</P>
<P>
	Renewed rumors of a takeover bid for BMW swirled Saturday after  
German daily Die Welt reported Detroit-based General Motors, the 
biggest car company in the world, planned to make an offer. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors on Saturday declined to comment on the report.  
</P>
<P>
	Speculation on BMW's future has mounted along with losses at its  
British subsidiary, Rover. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW has invested more than $3.5 billion since buying the company  
in 1994. Yet analysts expect Rover to post a pretax loss of about 
$590 million for 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Takeover and merger rumors were stoked when Bernd Pischetsrieder  
resigned as BMW chairman 10 days ago, amid criticism of his 
handling of Rover. 
</P>
<P>
	BMW's main shareholder, the Quandt family, has consistently said  
its 46 percent stake isn't for sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Motor Co. president Jac Nasser last week declined to rule  
out a possible acquisition of German automaker BMW AG, but said he 
believes BMW and its major shareholders when they say they want to 
remain independent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wouldn't rule out anybody,'' Nasser said. ``But I think when  
a company with the stature of BMW and their board come out and say 
they want to be independent, you have to respect that.''

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Trial Broke New Ground </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- That was one strange trial.  
</P>
<P>
	No live witnesses. A presiding officer who could be overruled at  
any time. And jurors who were announcing their verdicts while the 
trial was still going on. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton's impeachment trial omitted many of the  
protections guaranteed to defendants in ordinary criminal trials. 
But the Senate also gave the defense a big boost by denying House 
prosecutors a chance to put on a full case. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., called it a ``sham trial'' because of  
the lack of live witnesses or full investigation of the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the Constitution's framers allowed this kind of trial  
when they handed the responsibility to the Senate as a political 
process rather than a criminal proceeding. And they built in a high 
threshold for removing a president -- 67 of the 100 senators must 
convict. In Clinton's case, the final tally fell well short. 
</P>
<P>
	``We shouldn't hang our heads because it was messy,'' said  
Charles Geyh, an Indiana University law professor. ``It was meant 
to be inefficient. That was part of the genius of the framers'' to 
ensure impeachment would not be used often. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no comparison between this and anything else that's  
ever happened,'' said former Rep. John Bryant, D-Texas, who led the 
prosecution in then-federal judge Alcee Hastings' 1989 impeachment 
trial. That case was conducted as a ``real trial,'' Bryant said. 
</P>
<P>
	During Clinton's trial:  
</P>
<P>
	--Senators swore to ``do impartial justice,'' but unlike normal  
jurors they weren't screened for bias and were free to express 
their opinions in public. They also were allowed to interpret the 
law themselves; ordinary trial jurors are instructed to follow the 
law as explained by the judge. 
</P>
<P>
	--Procedures were not worked out in advance, but were negotiated  
during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	--Very little evidence was presented. Senators heard many days of  
arguments by prosecutors and defense lawyers but viewed only 
excerpts of videotaped sworn statements by Monica Lewinsky and two 
Clinton confidants. Some people were not called at all, including 
presidential secretary Betty Currie, even though they were involved 
in key events at issue in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
	--Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist had little authority as  
presiding officer, serving largely as a traffic cop to keep the 
proceedings moving. If senators had disagreed with any of his 
rulings, they could have voted to overturn them. In the end, they 
did not. 
</P>
<P>
	--There were no specific rules of evidence and no legal standards  
governing the charges against Clinton. His lawyers argued the 
allegations were vague and would have been thrown out in a criminal 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	--Had the Senate's verdict gone against Clinton and he was  
removed from office, he would have had no right to appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	The impeachment process ``differs markedly from the criminal  
justice system, and thank heaven it does,'' Miami defense lawyer 
Neal Sonnett said. ``The criminal justice system would be teetering 
on its foundations if criminal cases were brought and decided in 
this way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Criminal courts aim to ensure a truly impartial jury ``rather  
than one that swears to impartiality, then races to the TV 
cameras,'' Northwestern University law professor Steven Lubet said. 
But he added, ``This is a good way to handle impeachment because 
impeachment is a political question.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Indiana's Geyh, who also directs the American Judicature  
Society's center for judicial independence, said the Senate should 
work on revising its impeachment trial procedures so any future 
trial would be ``less of a free-for-all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Several legal experts said Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's  
investigation that led to the House impeachment vote also 
demonstrated to Americans the power of federal prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Starr was criticized for many actions, such as allowing his  
agents to question Ms. Lewinsky without her lawyer present and 
forcing her mother to testify against her before a federal grand 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
	But Georgetown University law professor Louis Michael Seidman  
noted: ``A lot of the abuses that people have attacked Ken Starr 
for are standard operating procedure on the part of prosecutors. 
Prosecutors have tremendous power to disrupt people's lives.''

<HEADLINE> American Airlines' Flights Resuming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Enough American Airlines pilots have taken  
themselves off a sick list that American Airlines officials hope to 
be able to resume regular service as early as Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	As of late Sunday, ``well under 1,000'' of American's 9,400  
pilots were still listed as sick, compared to the nearly 2,500 
Thursday and Friday who declared themselves unfit to fly, an 
American spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just glad they are coming back and we hope by the end of  
the week to be in business as usual here,'' said Sonja Whitemon, 
adding that 100 percent service was possible by Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	However, about 231 flights, or about 10 percent, scheduled for  
today have been canceled because not all of the pilots were 
immediately available for flying. 
</P>
<P>
	According to American, pilots have been taking themselves off of  
the sick list at a rapid rate since a federal judge held the Allied 
Pilots Association and two top board members in contempt and 
promised sizable fines against them. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall said Saturday that the union did  
not do enough to encourage pilots to return to work after his court 
order. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half a million travelers have been left at the gate by  
the nation's second-largest airline because of the large number of 
pilots calling in sick. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the continued cancellations, most of the nation's  
airports were calmer Sunday with many passengers prepared for 
delays. 
</P>
<P>
	At Miami International Airport, heart-shaped decorations adorned  
American's baggage counter wall Sunday and musicians strolled 
through the terminal serenading passengers. But many travelers 
remained angry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I lost two to three years of age off my life,'' said  
Luis Delgado, a furniture exporter who faced delays in three cities 
over four days while trying to get home to Santo Domingo, Dominican 
Republic. ``This is not my problem, it's American Airlines. We 
don't have to be the ones that suffer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The slowdown had the potential to severely hamper operations of  
cruise ships sailing in and out of Miami, but major cruise lines 
kept damage to a minimum by chartering their own flights. 
</P>
<P>
	``It really worked out well for us,'' said Fran Sevcik,  
spokeswoman for Norwegian Cruise Lines, which had chartered several 
flights anyway in anticipation of the heavy travel weekend. ``With 
very few exceptions, our guests were able to come and go because of 
these flights we had for them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall said he would decide Wednesday how much to levy in fines  
although he promised they would be substantial. He required the 
union to place $10 million with the court and for union president 
Rich LaVoy and vice president Brian Mayhew to remit a total of 
$15,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the guy who gets to stick his chin out there. I'm trying  
to protect the careers of these pilots,'' said LaVoy, who told 
pilots in a hotline to continue to call crew scheduling to get off 
of the sick list. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we are disappointed and disagree with Judge Kendall's  
order of contempt. We urge all pilots to comply with the 
restraining order,'' LaVoy said. ``We're taking his order 
seriously. I took his order seriously Wednesday night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LaVoy said the union has not considered whether to appeal the  
contempt order. 
</P>
<P>
	Union members have been calling in sick and refusing to accept  
overtime since Feb. 6 in a dispute concerning how quickly American 
should integrate the pilots from recently purchased Reno Air into 
its own roster. Negotiations on that issue are scheduled to restart 
this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 6,000 flights have been canceled since the work action  
began, costing American between $67 million and $90 million, 
according to Chris Chiames, a spokesman for AMR Corp., parent 
company of American Airlines.

<HEADLINE> Book: E-Mail Started Lewinsky Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A coming book suggests Hillary Rodham Clinton  
may have had it half right when she complained about a ``vast 
right-wing conspiracy'' against her husband. Clinton's foes weren't 
vast, the book says, but they were conservative and persistent in 
trying to bring him down. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsweek reporter Michael Isikoff, who helped break the story  
that would lead to only the second presidential impeachment, says a 
``handful of determined enemies'' worked to undermine President 
Clinton and get the explosive Monica Lewinsky tapes to the special 
prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
	Isikoff's book, ``Uncovering Clinton: A Reporter's Story,'' is  
to be published in April. An article adapted from the book is 
published in Newsweek's Feb. 22 issue, on newsstands Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The article identifies ``conspirators'' who are either familiar  
players in the Lewinsky saga or have been reported previously as 
working back channels. 
</P>
<P>
	But it offers new detail on the Lewinsky story, from the time it  
dropped into the laps of a loose band of lawyers and others 
involved in the Paula Jones case in November 1997 to the night in 
January 1998 when Linda Tripp disclosed her friend's relationship 
with Clinton to the independent counsel's office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Although the conspirators were conservative, they were not the  
'vast' group that Hillary Clinton suspected,'' Isikoff writes. 
``Instead, they were a handful of determined enemies of the 
president who not only helped the Jones camp but also led a willing 
Linda Tripp to Kenneth Starr.'' 
</P>
<P>
	According to the book, when New York literary agent Lucianne  
Goldberg wanted to air her friend Mrs. Tripp's claims, she first 
called conservative publisher Alfred Regnery, who gave her the 
phone number of Chicago banker Peter Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who has underwritten anti-Clinton publicity, put her in  
touch with Richard Porter, an associate at the Chicago law firm 
where Starr bases his private practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after, Isikoff says, an electronic mail message from Porter  
arrived on the computer screen of New York lawyer George Conway, 
who had been quietly helping the Jones attorneys. It said: 
``There's a woman named Lewisky (sic). She indulges a certain 
Lothario in the Casa Blanca for oral sex in the pantry.'' Casa 
Blanca is Spanish for White House. 
</P>
<P>
	The e-mail also mentioned ``romantic tapes.'' Mrs. Tripp's  
secret tape recordings of her conversations with Ms. Lewinsky were 
central in the impeachment trial that ended Friday with Clinton's 
acquittal. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Tripp was soon talking directly to the lawyers in Mrs.  
Jones' sexual harassment suit against the president, and a month 
later she and Ms. Lewinsky were subpoenaed by them. Isikoff writes 
that Mrs. Tripp was willing to testify but told lawyers ``I need to 
look hostile'' about being called to give evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The book says Ms. Goldberg got a call from Mrs. Tripp on Dec.  
23, 1997, and wrote in her notebook: ``Linda told 'pretty girl' she 
would not lie'' under oath. 
</P>
<P>
	The tip about Ms. Lewinsky made it to Starr's office via another  
circuitous route -- a Philadelphia dinner that an associate of the 
Jones lawyers had with a Starr associate. The tip was passed on to 
Jackie Bennett, Starr's right-hand man, who said that if Mrs. Tripp 
had information, she should give it to prosecutors directly. 
</P>
<P>
	Three days later Bennett was on the phone with Mrs. Tripp and,  
on Jan. 17, 1998, Clinton testified in the Jones case. Caught 
off-guard by detailed questions about Ms. Lewinsky, he denied under 
oath that they had ``sexual relations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Isikoff, the first reporter to hear the Tripp tapes, writes that  
he turned down an early offer to let him hear them. ``I did not 
want to be a part of whatever they were up to,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Charlton Heston Makes New 'Friends' </HEADLINE>

``Friends'' were until he made a recent guest appearance on the

<HEADLINE> Kwan Ready for World Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The United States will bring the sport's  
crown jewel, Michelle Kwan -- and a collection of less-sparkling 
skaters -- to next month's world championships in Finland. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan won her third U.S. Figure Skating Championships on  
Saturday. She was unchallenged at the Delta Center and, with the 
exception of perhaps Russia's Maria Butyrskaya, doesn't figure to 
have much trouble winning her third world title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love competing at nationals, worlds and Olympics,'' Kwan  
said. ``I don't pay attention to people who are coming up. You know 
there are people out there, working just as hard as you, maybe even 
harder. You have to be on top of your game, because you just never 
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of those people coming up are precocious teens who idolize  
Kwan, even though she's just 18 herself. Two of them, 13-year-olds 
Naomi Nari Nam and Sarah Hughes, finished second and fourth at the 
nationals. 
</P>
<P>
	Nari Nam can't go to the worlds because of her age, but Hughes  
can after finishing second in the 1999 World Junior Championships, 
thanks to an International Skating Union rule: A medalist at the 
world juniors, regardless of age, is eligible for the next senior 
worlds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not really worried about not going to worlds,'' Nari Nam  
said, although her coach, John Nicks, was angry about what he 
termed ``age discrimination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy about my placement,'' added Nari Nam, who will be  
replaced by Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
	The other U.S. woman on the team is third-place finisher Angela  
Nikodinov, also a newcomer to senior worlds. She got a telephone 
pep talk from Olympic champion Tara Lipinski, now a pro, before 
Saturday's free skate. 
</P>
<P>
	While Kwan is America's best bet in Finland, U.S. men's champion  
Michael Weiss isn't nearly as strong a contender. Weiss once again 
missed his quadruple toe loop in the free skate, and against the 
likes of Russian world champ Alexei Yagudin, Weiss will need the 
four-rotation jump. 
</P>
<P>
	He plans to use it twice -- for the first time, quads are allowed  
in the short program, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``The quad in the short is something a bunch of people have  
tried this year that hasn't paid off yet,'' said Weiss, who was 
sixth at the '98 worlds. ``It could be something that is very 
crucial in the next couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been working on it, doing it well in practice, and plan  
on doing it at the world championships this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also will switch his short program from Van Halen to  
Beethoven, hoping to have more appeal to foreign judges. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Weiss in Helsinki will be Trifun Zivanovic, who soared  
from seventh to second in one year, and Timothy Goebel, the only 
American to cleanly land a quad in competition. Both will make 
their senior world debuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Zivanovic staged the best performance of his life in the free  
skate. He draws inspiration from his mother, Glenda, who has 
multiple sclerosis and attended the nationals in a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
	The American ice dancers also have little major international  
experience in seniors. Winners Naomi Lang and Peter Tchernyshev 
never have been to the senior worlds. Runners-up Eve Chalom and 
Mathew Gates went in 1997 and were 17th. 
</P>
<P>
	Pairs champions Danielle and Steve Hartsell won the world  
juniors in '97 and steadily moved up the U.S. ranks. But to expect 
them to excel in Helsinki in their debut could be asking a bit 
much. 
</P>
<P>
	Kyoko Ina and John Zimmerman, second at the nationals, might  
have a better chance to challenge the Europeans. Ina went to four 
worlds with former partner Jason Dungjen (now one of the Hartsells' 
coaches) and Zimmerman also went in 1997, with Stephanie Stiegler. 
</P>
<P>
	Not surprisingly, the third team for the worlds, Laura Handy and  
J. Paul Binnebose, has virtually no international experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Such things can be expected in a post-Olympic year, but this  
will be an especially green U.S. squad. 
</P>
<P>
	At least it has Kwan.

<HEADLINE> Ice Fishers Vie on Valentine's Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILDHORSE RESERVOIR, Nev. (AP) -- Here in frozen northern Nevada,  
the objects of affection on this Valentine's Day were wooed not 
with chocolates and roses -- but with augers and worms. 
</P>
<P>
	The goal was not requited love but rather a lucky hole. And  
landing a desired beauty -- preferably one with a $2,500 tag -- well, 
that would be even better. 
</P>
<P>
	Welcome to the annual Wildhorse Ice Fishing Derby, where  
passions run deep for the bounty that swims below the thick ice of 
this 2,800-acre reservoir, located 60 miles north of Elko in a 
region commonly referred to as the Siberia of Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a beautiful day,'' said M'Lynn Buonamici, pointing to  
four good-sized trout she and her family had caught. ``This is 
better than roses. You can't eat roses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On this day, warmth from the winter sun was chilled by a stiff  
breeze off the surrounding mountains. With clouds building on the 
horizon and temperatures Sunday in the low teens, the wind chill 
was subzero. 
</P>
<P>
	Anglers jigged and dipped their lines in hopes of nabbing one of  
the 58 fish that had been released into the water after being fixed 
with tags of $50 to $2,500. 
</P>
<P>
	Judy Travis warmed herself in the family's four-wheel-drive  
vehicle, parked on the frozen lake, while her husband manned the 
ice hole. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never done this before,'' she said. ``I don't mind at  
all,'' though by midmorning she conceded she'd had enough fun for 
one day. 
</P>
<P>
	Their friends, Glenn and Jenny Bakker of Battle Mountain,  
watched over their ice holes in matching, insulated, camouflaged 
coveralls. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're getting ready to go shopping for flowers and Valentine's  
cards in Elko,'' Glenn Bakker quipped. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was willing,'' Jenny Bakker said of her Valentine's Day on  
the frozen lake. ``They didn't have to drag me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dave Brown of Elko wondered if he'd get a chilly reception from  
his wife when he got home. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm probably going to get divorced over this one,'' he  
laughed. He said his wife preferred to stay home where it was warm. 
</P>
<P>
	While some anglers brought portable huts or tents for  
protection, most of this rugged bunch braved the elements on 
folding chairs and fish pails. 
</P>
<P>
	Joanie Buonamici of Reno sat sewing in a pickup truck with her  
grandson while her husband and other family members sat out on the 
ice, wrapped head to toe in thick gear. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was out there yesterday but not today,'' she said. ``I don't  
like the wind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She didn't mind spending this day of romance in the desolation  
of northern Nevada. In fact, they've made the 360-mile, one-way 
trip from Reno for three years in a row. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like to come along. I don't want to stay home,'' she said.  
</P>
<P>
	``She better not mind. She's here now,'' her husband Enzo said,  
noting with pride the gas-powered auger his wife had given him as a 
gift a few years ago. ``Besides, it was her idea.''

<HEADLINE> Soccer Heads Wants 2-Yr World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- FIFA president Sepp Blatter repeated his  
call for the World Cup to be played every two years instead of 
four, but deflected questions Sunday about whether the Women's 
World Cup should follow a similar course. 
</P>
<P>
	Blatter, speaking at a news conference a few hours before the  
draw for this summer's Women's World Cup, said holding the men's 
event every two years would strengthen national teams. 
</P>
<P>
	With players frequently crossing national boundaries to play  
club soccer, Blatter said, the importance of the national teams is 
being diluted. Holding the World Cup more frequently could help 
address that problem, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Blatter's suggestion has been attacked by many other soccer  
officials worldwide, but the head of FIFA -- the world governing 
body for soccer -- said new ideas should not be rejected just 
because they would lead to change. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like when Alexander Graham Bell invented the telephone,''  
said Blatter, who plans to report to FIFA's executive committee on 
March 11-12 about the proposal. ``People said, `We don't need it 
because we already have the telegraph.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about the Women's World Cup also going to a two-year  
schedule, Blatter did not answer directly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it will be easier to have a Women's World Cup every  
two years than a men's World Cup every two years,'' he said with a 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	Blatter also said he favors experimenting with two referees in  
soccer matches, though only if such an experiment could take place 
over a full season. Trying it in only one competition would not be 
enough time to assess such a trial, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FIFA president pointed out that female referees will be used  
in the Women's World Cup, to be held in seven U.S. cities from June 
19-July 10. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think women will pay more respect to their gender in the  
game,'' said Blatter, who added that more women's referees must be 
trained. ``There will be so many women's matches in the future that 
we'll need the same number of women's officials as men's 
officials.''

<HEADLINE>  Man Has Skied 3,000 Straight Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARRABASSETT VALLEY, Maine (AP) -- It's simply called ``The  
Streak.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Schipper, 75, started in 1981 skiing every day that  
Sugarloaf USA was open, and he hasn't stopped. Sunday was his 
3,000th consecutive day of skiing. 
</P>
<P>
	He already was looking ahead after starting his day by skiing  
down the resort's black diamond Narrow Gauge trail. He wants to 
extend the streak to 5,000, which would take another 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's something to shoot for,'' he said. ``I don't think it's  
impossible. I ski with a lot of guys who are in their 80s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schipper's streak has made a local celebrity of the former  
fighter pilot and commercial airline pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, he and Olympic moguls gold medalist Jonny Moseley  
led a parade that included several hundred children who skied down 
the mountain. People were still congratulating him Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Schipper retired from flying in 1972 to do something he always  
wanted to do: open a ski lodge and ski every day. He sold the 
Lumberjack Lodge two years ago, but he stills skis every day. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's still the iron man,'' his son, Jeff Schipper, said. ``No  
one thought it would go this far.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It hasn't always been easy.  
</P>
<P>
	Schipper has skied in horrible conditions, including rain,  
blizzards and minus-70 windchills. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years ago, he broke a thumb during a spill but never stopped  
skiing. He brought the handle of the ski pole with him to the 
doctor's office so a cast could be made to fit around it. 
</P>
<P>
	In the spring of 1993, Schipper delayed surgery to remove a  
cancerous kidney so he could keep skiing. In 1995, he underwent 
triple bypass heart surgery during the off-season. The heart 
surgeon also replaced one of his heart valves with a valve from a 
pig. 
</P>
<P>
	Both times, Schipper recuperated in time to resume his streak  
when the snow began falling in late October. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, it's been easy.  
</P>
<P>
	``It hasn't been that hard lately,'' Schipper said. ``It's  
become a routine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schipper is wearing a helmet for the first time this year. He  
also has the latest hourglass-shaped parabolic skis. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not as fast as I used to be,'' he said. ``When I'm with a  
group, I'm tail-end Charlie. I used to be leading the group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The way he talked Sunday, skiing every day for another 10 years  
seems like no big deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way I feel, I don't see why I can't do it,'' he said.  
``This year it's going good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But he occasionally thinks about the day he must quit. It's an  
idea his wife doesn't entertain. 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll keep it up,'' said Christine Schipper, a Tennessee  
native who doesn't like the cold. ``If he doesn't want to, I'll 
force him. It gets him out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't imagine getting up and saying I don't have to do it  
any more,'' Schipper said. ``So I'll stick to it.''

<HEADLINE> 'Il Trovatore' Revived at the Met </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- All any good production of Verdi's ``Il  
Trovatore'' needs is -- to paraphrase the legendary soprano Rosa 
Ponselle -- the four greatest singers in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	If they're not available, the cast assembled for the  
Metropolitan Opera's revival Friday night will do quite nicely. 
</P>
<P>
	Verdi responded to this tangled tale of jealousy, passion,  
murder and revenge with one of his most inspired scores -- melodies 
of white-hot intensity that explode with energy at every turn. The 
score is also hard on the singers, requiring both vocal firepower 
and great dexterity. 
</P>
<P>
	Nowhere is this more evident than in the role of Azucena, the  
deranged gypsy whose dark secret holds the key to whatever logic 
there is in the plot. The Russian mezzo Larissa Diadkova displayed 
a voice of impressive size, especially in the lower register, and a 
dramatic abandon that riveted the audience's attention whenever she 
was onstage. 
</P>
<P>
	As Manrico, whom Azucena has raised as her own son, Canadian  
tenor Richard Margison also struck sparks -- most notably in a 
show-stopping ``Di quella pira'' with long and ringing high C's. 
</P>
<P>
	American soprano Michele Crider, in the role of Manrico's  
beloved Leonora, got better as the evening wore on after sounding 
strangely tentative in her opening aria, ``Tacea la notte 
placida.'' She is a stylish singer, but above high B she often 
sounds unsteady at full volume. 
</P>
<P>
	Completing the international ensemble, Mexican baritone Genaro  
Sulvaran made his Met debut as the villainous Count di Luna. He may 
have lacked the polish to make his big aria, ``Il balen,'' 
memorable, but otherwise he sang with considerable vigor. 
</P>
<P>
	Also making his debut was the conductor, Jun Maerkl, a German  
who led the orchestra and chorus with spirit and precision. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1987 production looks as grim and ugly as ever, dominated by  
Ezio Frigerio's ridiculous staircase and movable columns. Frigerio 
also is the culprit behind the pillars that pass for set designs in 
this year's new production of Donizetti's ``Lucia di Lammermoor.''

<HEADLINE> Princess Won't Address IOC Bribes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Princess Anne has refused to testify before a  
Parliamentary committee looking into the Olympic bribery scandal, a 
British newspaper reported Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Observer said that Princess Anne, one of Britain's two  
International Olympic Committee members, would not make an 
unprecedented royal appearance before the House of Commons 
committee on culture, media and sport. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee is looking into the process of lobbying for the  
Olympics and other high-profile events. There have been no 
allegations of wrongdoing by the princess, a former Olympic 
equestrian competitor. 
</P>
<P>
	Princess Anne has long been portrayed as a critic of IOC  
President Juan Antonio Samaranch and is known to be troubled by the 
corruption scandal surrounding the IOC. She is also believed to be 
one of the few IOC members who never accepts gifts. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no way that she would appear or give evidence,'' the  
newspaper quoted an unnamed ``royal source'' as saying. ``The 
princess has no intention of appearing before the committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buckingham Palace confirmed the princess had been invited to  
talk to the committee but declined to say if she would accept. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said several committee members believe Princess  
Anne's position was now untenable, suggesting she will be under 
mounting pressure to resign from the IOC. 
</P>
<P>
	Simon Clegg, chief executive of the British Olympic Association,  
said he and Craig Reedie, Britain's other IOC member, would give 
evidence.

<HEADLINE> Indian Air Controllers in Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- After weeks of seeing flights across the  
country disrupted, the Civil Aviation Ministry on Sunday prepared 
to fire air traffic controllers and ask the air force to help 
maintain operations, local news agencies reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The controllers, who are demanding more pay, deny they are  
delaying flights deliberately and that they are only following 
government rules. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's decision to crack down on the controllers  
appeared to be in response to pressure from international and 
domestic airline companies that have lost millions of rupees in 
canceled flights and extra hotels rooms to accommodate stranded 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	Brijendra Shekhar, president of the Air Traffic Controllers  
Guild, said the union would respond if its members were fired, but 
would not elaborate. He blamed poor infrastructure and faulty 
procedures for the delays.

<HEADLINE> Utley Ready To Take Giant Steps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Seven years and three months after his football  
career, and his life, were shattered by a paralyzing spine injury, 
Mike Utley plans to take a few steps in public Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	They will be halting, small steps to be sure, but they will also  
be giant strides for this irrepressible man who has come to 
epitomize determination and courage in the face of grim odds. 
</P>
<P>
	On that November afternoon in 1991, after one of the violent  
collisions so common in the NFL, Utley lay motionless on the turf 
before a silent crowd at the Silverdome in Pontiac, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
	The 6-foot-6, 315-pound offensive lineman for the Detroit Lions  
was carried off the field. His sixth and seventh vertebrae were 
crushed. He was paralyzed, a quadriplegic. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet Utley refused to give up. He has skydived and scuba dived,  
gone skiing and taken kayak lessons. He drives a specially equipped 
van. Most significant, he started a foundation aimed at finding a 
cure for spinal cord injuries, and helping those who have been 
stricken, mostly teen-agers or young adults. 
</P>
<P>
	``Thumbs up'' became his trademark.  
</P>
<P>
	Utley has vowed to someday walk off the field from that precise  
spot where he was injured. He isn't ready for that yet. But those 
first public steps will show how far he has come. 
</P>
<P>
	He's already taken as many as five or six steps in private.  
Before a select group of reporters and photographers, with two 
close friends -- retired center Bill Lewis and Detroit Lions 
linebacker Rob Frederickson -- at his side, he will take them for 
everyone to see. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's one of the strongest people internally that I've ever  
been associated with,'' said George Dempsey, president of the 
Phoenix-based Mike Utley Foundation. ``He has incredible charisma, 
especially with teen-agers and young adults. And he has a 
million-dollar smile.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dempsey met Utley nearly seven years ago.  
</P>
<P>
	``I told him `Mike, you are going to do more from your  
wheelchair to help the children of this country than you could ever 
have done playing professional football,''' Dempsey said. ``And 
that's exactly what he's done. He's an incredible inspiration.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When doctors told him he would never walk again, Utley ordered  
them out of the room and said never tell him what he couldn't do. 
</P>
<P>
	Just past his 33rd birthday, after years of grueling,  
mind-numbing, repetitive physical therapy, Utley is careful not to 
call what he will do Monday ``walking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Just recently, I have accomplished what some doctors told me  
was impossible,'' he said in a statement released by his publicist 
last week. ``I stood up and took a few steps. This injury does 
change you if you let it. I won't let it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The injury has transformed a largely undisciplined, fun-loving  
athlete from Washington State University into a supremely 
disciplined, yet no less fun-loving, quadriplegic who refused to 
surrender. 
</P>
<P>
	``He works harder than any person I've ever met,'' Dempsey said.  
``He is at gym and therapy six days a week. He is relentless. He 
has a work ethic that is second to none.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Utley's injury was known as ``incomplete'' in medical terms,  
which means he had some sensations and slight functions in his 
legs. 
</P>
<P>
	He went to the University of Miami medical school for  
biofeedback treatment, looking to find the connection between his 
brain and those few nerves that survived. 
</P>
<P>
	He has spent the last eight to 10 months strengthening his legs  
so they could support his still sizable upper body. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had to get his hip flexors moving in order to move his  
legs,'' Dempsey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Utley, who continued to receive his football salary after his  
injury, plans to spend his winters in Phoenix and his summers near 
Seattle, where he grew up and his family still lives. 
</P>
<P>
	All the while, he will keep aiming toward that goal, so  
unthinkable a few years ago, of getting up from the turf in the 
Silverdome and walking off the field. After Monday, it will seem 
more than a quadriplegic's pipe dream.

<HEADLINE> China Won't Devalue Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin says he is  
confident that China will not devalue its currency despite pressure 
to do so, Time magazine reports in its latest issue. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview that took place week, Jiang was quoted as saying  
that the Chinese currency will ``stay stable'' although a 
devaluation of the yuan would boost the country's exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Most Asian countries have devalued their currencies because of  
the regional economic crisis, making Chinese goods more expensive. 
But despite the pressure and rumors of a yuan devaluation that have 
occasionally rattled Asian markets, Beijing has said repeatedly 
that it wants to keep the Chinese currency stable. 
</P>
<P>
	Jiang also complained that the United States wants to sell China  
products Beijing doesn't need while restricting sales of some 
things it wants to buy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Chinese are very smart. On our own, we developed the  
hydrogen and atomic bombs,'' the Chinese leader was quoted as 
saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Jiang said that if Washington refuses to ``sell us satellites  
and other new high-tech products, we may be able to develop them by 
ourselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese officials have repeatedly called on the United States to  
lift restrictions on high-tech sales to China, saying such sales 
could help redress the surging U.S. trade deficit with China.

	Moderate Republicans Focus on 2000  
</P>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Sen. John McCain, fresh from voting for the  
Republicans' failed effort to convict President Clinton on 
impeachment articles, told a gathering of party moderates Saturday 
that the GOP must move on to important issues. ``We Republicans 
have a great deal of work to do to remind voters that we are not 
simply the anti-Clinton party,'' said the Arizona Republican, who 
is considering a presidential run in 2000. McCain, a war hero, said 
the impeachment proceedings were difficult but brought senators 
closer together.

	Clinton To Visit Mexico  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House officials admit that Mexico still  
has a ``tremendous problem'' with drug trafficking but are praising 
its eradication efforts in advance of President Clinton's two-day 
trip there that begins Sunday. Mexico's war against drug 
traffickers, highlighted by a new $400 million, land-sea-and-air 
battle plan, tops the agenda for Clinton's meetings with Mexican 
President Ernesto Zedillo. In addition to drugs, their agenda 
includes trade, migration and the environment.

	American Union Charged With Contempt  
</P>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- An irate federal judge Saturday held  
American Airlines' pilots union and two top board members in 
contempt and promised sizable fines against them, saying the union 
did not do enough to encourage pilots to return to work after a 
court order. More than half a million travelers have been left at 
the gate by the nation's second-largest airline because of the 
large number of pilots calling in sick. Although a judge had 
ordered the pilots Wednesday to quit their job action stemming from 
a dispute with management, about 1,700 of the airline's 9,400 
pilots remained on the sick list Saturday.

	Clinton Commits Troops to Kosovo  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As many as 4,000 American troops will go to  
Kosovo as part of a 28,000-strong NATO peacekeeping force if 
warring Serbs and ethnic Albanians reach a political settlement, 
President Clinton said Saturday. Clinton said that without a U.S. 
commitment, the warfare could bleed beyond Kosovo's borders -- into 
Albania, Macedonia, Greece, Turkey, and even re-ignite conflict in 
Bosnia. The president's commitment of U.S. personnel was timed to 
strengthen Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's hand as she flew 
to France to nudge stalled talks between the Serb government and 
ethnic Albanians seeking independence for Kosovo.

	OSWIECIM, Poland (AP) -- Germany's defense minister made a solemn  
trip Saturday to the former Auschwitz death camp in southern 
Poland. German Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping laid a wreath 
draped in Germany's national colors at the Death Wall, where 
thousands of prisoners were shot to death when Auschwitz was a 
concentration camp during World War II. He was joined by Poland's 
Defense Minister, along with scores of German soldiers as part 
training exercises with Polish troops, a first in German-Polish 
relations since the war.

	Microsoft Wins Piracy Case in China

	BEIJING (AP) -- A Beijing court has ordered two Chinese firms to  
pay $100,000 in compensation to Microsoft for using its software 
without authorization, the state-run Xinhua News Agency reported 
Saturday. Beijing Haisida Science and Technology Development Co. 
and Min'an Investment Consulting Co. were found guilty of copyright 
infringement, Xinhua reported. Despite the relatively small damages 
ordered, the ruling may set a precedent for other software piracy 
cases in China, where most computers operate on pirated software. 
Court officials were not available for comment late Saturday.

	De La Hoya Beats Quartey on Points

	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Oscar De La Hoya passed what he called the  
toughest test of his career, getting up from a knockdown and twice 
knocking down Ike Quartey to retain the WBC welterweight 
championship on a split decision Saturday night. De La Hoya 
clinched the victory by storming out in the 12th round to knock 
down Quartey in just 12 seconds. The champion then pummeled Quartey 
for the next minute before tiring in front of a crowd of about 
12,000.

	PHOENIX (AP) -- Rex Chapman, struggling to find his shot all  
season, scored 12 points in overtime Saturday night and sent the 
Phoenix Suns past the winless Los Angeles Clippers 107-104. 
Chapman, just 5-of-19 when the fourth quarter ended tied at 93, 
made his first two shots in overtime, including a 3-pointer. He 
also hit 7-for-9 free throws to finish with 23 points. Phoenix's 
Jason Kidd knifed in front of Sherman Douglas to pick off an 
inbounds pass with two seconds to play, helping the Suns end a 
two-game skid.

<HEADLINE> De La Hoya Shows Champion's Heart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- Oscar De La Hoya had knocked down Ike Quartey  
in the sixth round and his fans were in a frenzy when, suddenly, De 
La Hoya was dropped by left hook. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought, `Hey I'm going to get right back up and stay in the  
fight,'' De La Hoya said. ``I'm no quitter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He showed tremendous heart,'' said Gil Clancy, De La Hoya's  
co-trainer. ``That's what won it for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The WBC welterweight champion won the last three rounds on all  
three official cards, knocking down Quartey and almost stopping him 
in the 12th round, to retain the 147-pound title on a split 
decision Saturday night in the Thomas &AMP; Mack Center. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought I won this fight,'' said the 29-year-old Quartey,  
who lost for first time. ``I did everything, he did nothing. He 
came to survive. That's all he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One judge, Larry O'Connell of Britain, scored it 115-114 for  
Quartey (34-1-1, 29 knockouts), John Keane of England scored it 
115-113 and Ken Morita of Japan scored it 115-112 for De La Hoya 
(30-0, 24 knockouts).. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP scored it 116-111 for De La Hoya.  
</P>
<P>
	The fight will be rebroadcast on HBO at 9:30 p.m. EST Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
	``I was throwing all the punches in the first nine rounds,''  
said Quartey, a former WBA champion who was stripped of that title. 
</P>
<P>
	It appeared, however, that De La Hoya had the best of several  
close rounds simply because he was busier. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he thought he was in trouble after 11 rounds, the  
26-year-old De La Hoya said, ``Truly, I thought I was in total 
control. I never thought I had to come back dramatically.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nevertheless, De La Hoya clinched the victory in dramatic  
fashion. 
</P>
<P>
	The champion, who weighed in officially at 147 pounds but was  
153 at fight time, knocked down Quartey, 146 1-2 and 156, with a 
left hook early in the round. He then trapped Quartey on the ropes 
and landed a 17-punch barrage that had the challenger reeling. 
Quartey, however, punched back enough to keep the fight from being 
stopped. De La Hoya became arm weary and there was little actions 
in the second half of the round. 
</P>
<P>
	All three judges scored the 12th round 10-8 for De La Hoya.  
</P>
<P>
	There were several periods of inaction in the fight as the  
fighters looked for opening that could end it and the fans 
anxiously waited for an explosion. There were several toe-to-toe 
exchanges, many in the final 30 seconds of a round, and there was 
that marvelous sixth round in which both men went down. 
</P>
<P>
	De La Hoya said he expected Quartey to be more aggressive, while  
De La Hoya's corner was disappointed he didn't box more. There was 
no doubt both men respected the other's abilities and power. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm finding out that I give too much respect to my opponent,''  
De La Hoya said. `I've just got to go out there and fight.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was talk of a rematch, as there always is after a good  
fight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to fight all the best fighters out there,'' De La Hoya  
said. ``If I beat the best, then I'll give him a rematch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It appears De La Hoya's next opponent will be Oba Carr at a date  
to be determined. Carr won a 10-round decision over Frankie Randall 
on Saturday night's pay-per-view card.

<HEADLINE> Ore. Ship Demolition Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COOS BAY, Ore. (AP) -- Demolition experts attempted to torch the  
remaining fuel from a heavily listing wreck on Sunday, estimating 
that 90 percent of the oil has been burned off the grounded 
freighter. 
</P>
<P>
	A helicopter dropped a fire accelerant on the ship Sunday  
afternoon to reignite one of the cargo holds of the New Carissa, 
which may have as much as 50,000 gallons of fuel oil remaining. 
</P>
<P>
	The practice was repeated several times throughout the  
afternoon, since the fire kept going out. The fire burned for about 
an hour, said Coast Guard Petty Officer Greg Folkins. 
</P>
<P>
	Additional attempts to burn off more fuel oil were expected  
Monday if weather conditions are favorable, Folkins said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want to continue burning until we can remove all or as much  
of the fuel as possible,'' he said. ``It's possible to burn down to 
a matter of millimeters of oil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The New Carissa went aground nearly two weeks ago, and was found  
a week ago to be leaking. It was set ablaze Thursday to burn of the 
400,000 gallons of fuel oil on board in the hope of avoiding a 
spill. 
</P>
<P>
	Tar balls have been spotted along the shore and 37 dead birds  
have been found. The tar balls were ``very few and far between,'' 
said Petty Officer J. Bigelow, a Coast Guard spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the spilled fuel oil has broken up into gooey balls  
ranging in size from a pea to that of a mud pie, with as many as 10 
such balls per square yard of ocean, according to Stephen Zylstra, 
a contaminants specialist with the U.S. Fish &AMP; Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the next few months, the oil spill could kill hundreds, and  
perhaps several thousand seabirds, Zylstra said. 
</P>
<P>
	Oyster farmers and fishermen were increasingly frustrated by  
closures that have kept them from harvest grounds. Some criticized 
the Coast Guard for being too slow to release important information 
such as spill estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	Crabbers pulled up traps Sunday near the New Carissa and found  
no evidence of oil contamination in the traps or the lines, 
officials said. State officials said results on tests to determine 
if shellfish, clams or oysters were contaminated will be available 
within a week.

<HEADLINE> Independent Counsel May Be History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers from both parties saw almost no  
chance Sunday for survival of the Independent Counsel Act, which 
provided the framework for Kenneth Starr's investigation of 
President Clinton, when it comes up for renewal this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This law needs to terminate. I don't want it to be amended. I  
want it to be ended,'' Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said on CNN's 
``Late Edition.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The act passed in 1978 as the post-Watergate Congress sought a  
means to ensure that politics did not interfere when the president, 
his cabinet and other senior officials are investigated for 
wrongdoing. It lapsed briefly in the early 1990s, but was renewed 
in 1994 in legislation signed by Clinton. It expires again June 30 
unless Congress and the president approve its reauthorization. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno, at the urging of Republicans, has  
seven times asked for the naming of an independent counsel to 
investigate administration officials, most notably Starr who has 
pursued President Clinton's connections to Whitewater, Travelgate, 
the FBI files and finally his affair with Monica Lewinsky, which 
led to Clinton's impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats contend that Starr abused the almost unlimited powers  
the act gives an independent counsel, while Republicans have joined 
Democrats in protesting the amount of money spent. Starr has spent 
more than $40 million over more than four years investigating the 
president. Another independent counsel, Donald Smaltz, took four 
years and $17 million looking into corruption charges against 
former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy. Espy was acquitted of those 
charges, and Clinton was found innocent of impeachment charges that 
grew out of Starr's investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also are unhappy about past independent counsel  
activities during GOP administrations and about Reno's decisions 
not to seek independent counsels for possible Democratic campaign 
fund-raising violations. 
</P>
<P>
	``One thing we can do in this Congress is not extend the life of  
the independent counsel statute. It was a post-Watergate liberal 
notion, and it was a disaster,'' said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, 
D-N.Y., on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's either going to be rewritten significantly, or it will be  
allowed to lapse. In all likelihood the latter,'' agreed Sen. Don 
Nickles of Oklahoma, Republican whip in the Senate, on ABC's ``This 
Week.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House Chief of Staff John Podesta, also on NBC, said that  
while the White House has taken no final position, ``It's virtually 
hopeless to try to fix it, I think, without some major, major 
revisions.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The American Bar Association, which helped craft the Independent  
Counsel Act two decades ago, last week voted 384-49 to end its 
support for the law. ``It was designed to remove politics from the 
investigation of public officials,'' said Philip Anderson, who 
heads the 400,000-member group. ``The majority of Americans would 
say that politics has not been removed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congress is likely to hold hearings on the future of the act in  
the coming weeks, but McConnell said in the end lawmakers could 
kill it just by failing to act on its renewal. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that the country handled its two biggest scandals,  
Teapot Dome in the 1920s and Watergate in the 1970s, without an 
independent counsel. ``I think the existing system can handle 
scandal quite well,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Thumbnails of Impeachment Moments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Snapshots: A young woman in a beret hugging a president. Bill  
Clinton, first outraged, jabbing his finger and denying; then, 
humbled and somber, addressing the nation. Vanloads of documents, 
zooming under high security from Kenneth Starr's office to the 
Capitol. House roll calls. Senate debates. 
</P>
<P>
	People: An intern whose crush held a nation hostage, whose name  
became a household word. A chief executive concerned about his 
place in history. A friend who betrayed. A dogged prosecutor. 
Congressional pit bulls of both political stripes, preening and 
posturing for the cameras and each other. 
</P>
<P>
	It was a year of image-making and image-retooling -- of already  
famous people redefining their personas voluntarily and 
involuntarily, of the unknown and the obscure claiming or being 
dragged onto center stage as a nation watched. 
</P>
<P>
	``We call a lot of this `The Accidental Celebrity,''' says  
Irving J. Rein, a Northwestern University professor who studies the 
marketing of celebrity. ``Many of these are people who have 
accidentally walked into or been pushed into the Clinton-Lewinsky 
situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Who were these people we came to know through their often quite  
intimate actions? What to make of these images and words they 
besieged us with? What became of them in the limelight? 
</P>
<P>
	Monica Lewinsky's public persona began, and endured, as a  
flighty intern with a deep infatuation that might have been love. 
The indelible videotaped image from Nov. 6, 1996 -- a star-struck 
girl in a beret bear-hugging the nation's chief executive -- defined 
her for a year. 
</P>
<P>
	But earlier this month, in videotaped testimony, she emerged as  
something different -- a thoughtful, composed young woman with a 
more muted hairstyle who knew the gravity of the situation and 
quietly demanded respect. 
</P>
<P>
	Linda Tripp -- derided as frumpy and frizzy, denounced as  
traitorous to a friend -- stood on the steps of a federal courthouse 
last summer and insisted she'd been caught up in a situation ``not 
of her own making.'' Said Tripp to the television cameras: ``I'm 
just like you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	By Friday, her hair was chin-length and she appeared much more  
composed as she appeared on Page One of The New York Times and 
national television in what the Times called ``an effort to 
rehabilitate her image.'' 
</P>
<P>
	More images: William Rehnquist in his striped-sleeve robe,  
sitting at the head of the Senate. Vernon Jordan on videotape -- 
patient, calm, confident. Rep. Henry Hyde before the Senate -- 
dogged, polite but insistent. 
</P>
<P>
	And Kenneth Starr, prosecutor. Is he politically motivated, as  
so many of Clinton's supporters say? Or was he simply a diligent 
prosecutor doing his job? 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, President Clinton. It is he, perhaps, whose image has  
changed the most. 
</P>
<P>
	Plagued for years by vague accusations, he found in the Lewinsky  
mess a set of concrete charges against him. At first, in high moral 
dudgeon, he wagged his finger and denied. ``I did not have sexual 
relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky. I never told anybody to 
lie, not a single time. Never,'' he said in January 1998. His wife 
created another catch phrase: ``vast right-wing conspiracy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet barely eight months later, Clinton was acknowledging an  
``inappropriate relationship'' and, in tortured testimony, dodging 
as best he could and creating catch phrases by the minute: ``It 
depends on what the meaning of `is' is.'' ``It depends on how you 
define `alone.''' 
</P>
<P>
	What images of him will be remembered? The cigar jokes? His  
swollen, almost pugilistic face as he sat upright and humbled, 
palms between his knees, on Aug. 17, after addressing the nation? 
His myriad and many-shaped pleas for forgiveness? 
</P>
<P>
	All the names, all the faces that passed across the stage.  
Sidney Blumenthal. David Kendall. Betty Currie. Trent Lott. Bob 
Barr. Matt Drudge. Will they endure? Will Americans, years from 
now, remember names like Linda Tripp, Kathleen Willey and, yes, 
Monica Lewinsky? Or will they fall into history's Dumpster, 
footnotes to a sad and confusing year? 
</P>
<P>
	Are they truly famous, or just notorious?

<HEADLINE>  Fans Say Bye to Maple Leafs Gardens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- On a night of tears, cheers and hockey nostalgia,  
the Chicago Blackhawks finished what they started -- winning the 
last NHL game at historic Maple Leaf Gardens just as they won the 
first 68 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfazed by the hoopla of a gala goodbye party, the Blackhawks  
dominated all but a few moments in the second period to break a 
seven-game losing streak and subdue a celebrity-studded crowd 
Saturday night with a 6-2 victory over Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	There was symmetry to the outcome, since it was the Blackhawks  
who won the opening game in the Gardens back in November 1931, 
beating the Maple Leafs 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blackhawks' Bob Probert had the honor of scoring the final  
NHL goal at the Gardens -- only his third of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got the puck and I'm going to put it on a plaque,'' said  
Probert. ``I'll never forget this moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though the Gardens will remain a venue for minor league hockey  
and other events, the Maple Leafs will have a new home as of next 
Saturday -- the 18,800-seat Air Canada Centre. The game with Chicago 
marked the NHL's departure from the last of the arenas built in the 
1920s and '30s for the league's Original Six franchises. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maple Leafs, under an intense media spotlight heading into  
the game, seemed nervous at the start, and Chicago jumped to a 
quick 2-0 lead. Tony Amonte backhanded his own rebound past Curtis 
Joseph at 4:18 for his 28th goal, and Reid Simpson made it 2-0 at 
6:41 with his first goal of the season.

<P>
	``We've slowly lost our shrines,'' he said. ``As we've moved to

tonight.''

<HEADLINE>  Fans Say Bye to Maple Leafs Gardens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- On a night of tears, cheers and hockey nostalgia,  
the Chicago Blackhawks finished what they started -- winning the 
last NHL game at historic Maple Leaf Gardens just as they won the 
first 68 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Unfazed by the hoopla of a gala goodbye party, the Blackhawks  
dominated all but a few moments in the second period to break a 
seven-game losing streak and subdue a celebrity-studded crowd 
Saturday night with a 6-2 victory over Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
	There was symmetry to the outcome, since it was the Blackhawks  
who won the opening game in the Gardens back in November 1931, 
beating the Maple Leafs 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
	The Blackhawks' Bob Probert had the honor of scoring the final  
NHL goal at the Gardens -- only his third of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got the puck and I'm going to put it on a plaque,'' said  
Probert. ``I'll never forget this moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though the Gardens will remain a venue for minor league hockey  
and other events, the Maple Leafs will have a new home as of next 
Saturday -- the 18,800-seat Air Canada Centre. The game with Chicago 
marked the NHL's departure from the last of the arenas built in the 
1920s and '30s for the league's Original Six franchises. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maple Leafs, under an intense media spotlight heading into  
the game, seemed nervous at the start, and Chicago jumped to a 
quick 2-0 lead. Tony Amonte backhanded his own rebound past Curtis 
Joseph at 4:18 for his 28th goal, and Reid Simpson made it 2-0 at 
6:41 with his first goal of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Maple Leafs captain Doug Gilmour stretched the  
Blackhawks' lead to 3-0 on a power-play goal at 3:11 of the second 
period before the Maple Leafs rallied. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Some American Pilots Back at Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- More than half of the American Airlines pilots  
participating in a sickout reported to work Sunday, but it wasn't 
enough to prevent 550 flights from being canceled. 
</P>
<P>
	Another 231 flights, or about 10 percent, of the flights  
scheduled for the Presidents Day holiday on Monday have already 
been canceled because not all of the pilots were immediately 
available for flying. 
</P>
<P>
	The mass return followed a judge's contempt order Saturday  
against the pilots union and two of its top officials. 
</P>
<P>
	An American spokeswoman said ``well under 1,000'' of the 9,400  
pilots were still shown as sick on Sunday, compared to the 2,500 
Thursday, when almost one in four pilots declared themselves unfit 
to fly. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're just glad they are coming back and we hope by the end of  
the week to be in business as usual here,'' added Sonja Whitemon, 
saying the airline could be offering close to 100 percent service 
as soon as Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	According to American, about 40 pilots per hour have been taking  
themselves off of the sick list since a federal judge held the 
Allied Pilots Association and two top board members in contempt and 
promised sizable fines against them. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Joe Kendall said Saturday that the union did  
not do enough to encourage pilots to return to work after his court 
order. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half a million travelers have been left at the gate by  
the nation's second-largest airline because of the large number of 
pilots calling in sick. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the continued cancellations, the nation's airports were  
calmer Sunday with many passengers prepared for delays. 
</P>
<P>
	Kendall said he would decide Wednesday how much to levy in fines  
although he promised they would be substantial. He required the 
union to place $10 million with the court and for union president 
Rich LaVoy and vice president Brian Mayhew to remit a total of 
$15,000. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm the guy who gets to stick his chin out there. I'm trying  
to protect the careers' of these pilots,'' said LaVoy, who told 
pilots in a hotline to continue to call crew scheduling to get off 
of the sick list. 
</P>
<P>
	``While we are disappointed and disagree with Judge Kendall's  
order of contempt. We urge all pilots to comply with the 
restraining order,'' LaVoy said. ``We're taking his order 
seriously. I took his order seriously Wednesday night.'' 
</P>
<P>
	LaVoy said the union has not considered whether to appeal the  
contempt order. 
</P>
<P>
	Union members have been calling in sick and refusing to accept  
overtime since Feb. 6 in a dispute concerning how quickly American 
should integrate the pilots from recently purchased Reno Air into 
its own roster. Negotiations on that issue are scheduled to restart 
on Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly 6,000 flights have been canceled since the work action  
began, costing American between $67 million and $90 million, 
according to Chris Chiames, a spokesman for AMR Corp., parent 
company of American Airlines.

<HEADLINE> Kwan Ready for World Championships </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The United States will bring the sport's  
crown jewel, Michelle Kwan -- and a collection of less-sparkling 
skaters -- to next month's world championships in Finland. 
</P>
<P>
	Kwan won her third U.S. Figure Skating Championships on  
Saturday. She was unchallenged at the Delta Center and, with the 
exception of perhaps Russia's Maria Butyrskaya, doesn't figure to 
have much trouble winning her third world title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love competing at nationals, worlds and Olympics,'' Kwan  
said. ``I don't pay attention to people who are coming up. You know 
there are people out there, working just as hard as you, maybe even 
harder. You have to be on top of your game, because you just never 
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of those people coming up are precocious teens who idolize  
Kwan, even though she's just 18 herself. Two of them, 13-year-olds 
Naomi Nari Nam and Sarah Hughes, finished second and fourth at the 
nationals. 
</P>
<P>
	Nari Nam can't go to the worlds because of her age, but Hughes  
can after finishing second in the 1999 World Junior Championships, 
thanks to an International Skating Union rule: A medalist at the 
world juniors, regardless of age, is eligible for the next senior 
worlds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not really worried about not going to worlds,'' Nari Nam  
said, although her coach, John Nicks, was angry about what he 
termed ``age discrimination.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy about my placement,'' added Nari Nam, who will be  
replaced by Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
	The other U.S. woman on the team is third-place finisher Angela  
Nikodinov, also a newcomer to senior worlds. She got a telephone 
pep talk from Olympic champion Tara Lipinski, now a pro, before 
Saturday's free skate. 
</P>
<P>
	While Kwan is America's best bet in Finland, U.S. men's champion  
Michael Weiss isn't nearly as strong a contender. Weiss once again 
missed his quadruple toe loop in the free skate, and against the 
likes of Russian world champ Alexei Yagudin, Weiss will need the 
four-rotation jump. 
</P>
<P>
	He plans to use it twice -- for the first time, quads are allowed  
in the short program, too. 
</P>
<P>
	``The quad in the short is something a bunch of people have  
tried this year that hasn't paid off yet,'' said Weiss, who was 
sixth at the '98 worlds. ``It could be something that is very 
crucial in the next couple of years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been working on it, doing it well in practice, and plan  
on doing it at the world championships this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also will switch his short program from Van Halen to  
Beethoven, hoping to have more appeal to foreign judges. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Weiss in Helsinki will be Trifun Zivanovic, who soared  
from seventh to second in one year, and Timothy Goebel, the only 
American to cleanly land a quad in competition. Both will make 
their senior world debuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Zivanovic staged the best performance of his life in the free  
skate. He draws inspiration from his mother, Glenda, who has 
multiple sclerosis and attended the nationals in a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
	The American ice dancers also have little major international  
experience in seniors. Winners Naomi Lang and Peter Tchernyshev 
never have been to the senior worlds. Runners-up Eve Chalom and 
Mathew Gates went in 1997 and were 17th. 
</P>
<P>
	Pairs champions Danielle and Steve Hartsell won the world  
juniors in '97 and steadily moved up the U.S. ranks. But to expect 
them to excel in Helsinki in their debut could be asking a bit 
much. 
</P>
<P>
	Kyoko Ina and John Zimmerman, second at the nationals, might  
have a better chance to challenge the Europeans. Ina went to four 
worlds with former partner Jason Dungjen (now one of the Hartsells' 
coaches) and Zimmerman also went in 1997, with Stephanie Stiegler. 
</P>
<P>
	Not surprisingly, the third team for the worlds, Laura Handy and  
J. Paul Binnebose, has virtually no international experience. 
</P>
<P>
	Such things can be expected in a post-Olympic year, but this  
will be an especially green U.S. squad. 
</P>
<P>
	At least it has Kwan.

<HEADLINE> Romney To Tackle Olympic Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Mitt Romney insists the Olympics are about  
sport, not business. 
</P>
<P>
	But he has plenty of business to attend to these days as the man  
in charge of cleaning up the scandal surrounding the Salt Lake City 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the day after he was hired to run the Salt Lake  
Organizing Committee, he appeared on ``Good Morning America,'' 
spoke with his staff, reviewed financial projections, met 
predecessor Frank Joklik and discussed marketing and sponsorships. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've worked in health care, in automotive parts, in financial  
services, and that's OK,'' the 51-year-old Boston businessman said. 
``But this is sport, and this is athletes and young people. This is 
a lot of fun. The Olympics are about sport, not about business; 
about athletes, not managers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Romney is confident he can allay the concerns of Olympic  
sponsors, who on Thursday in New York demanded major reform by the 
International Olympic Committee to root out corruption. 
</P>
<P>
	``Utah businesses have got to come together and say we're here  
for these Olympics,'' Romney said. ``If they don't, why should some 
New York business decide to support the Olympics?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, a half-dozen bodies are investigating the bid leading  
to the 2002 Games, with 24 IOC members -- more than one-fifth the 
group's body -- implicated in the bribery scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the investigators are the General Accounting Office,  
Congress' auditing arm; the U.S. Justice Department; and Utah's 
Attorney General. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not sure how long it will take,'' said Bernie Ungar, GAO  
director of government business operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Fitzgibbon, deputy staff director for the House Commerce  
Committee, said there is no deadline, but he and Ungar predicted 
the study could be completed this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Dingell, D-Mich., requested the inquiry on Jan. 27,  
citing ``seriously questionable, if not outright illegal,'' tactics 
during the Olympic bid. 
</P>
<P>
	The work could be complicated by the number of agencies involved  
-- the Secret Service, the FBI, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms, Department of Transportation, the Department of Defense 
and even the U.S. Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no central repository in the federal government for  
this information,'' Fitzgibbon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah has received a $90 million commitment from the U.S.  
Transportation Department for Olympic-related highway improvements. 
A department spokesman said those funds are not at risk. 
</P>
<P>
	But Rep. Merrill Cook, R-Utah, a member of the House  
Transportation Committee, said the scandal could jeopardize future 
funds.
