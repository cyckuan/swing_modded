CAIRO, May 3 (Xinhua) -- A young driver and a passenger were
killed and three other passengers injured in a road accident on
Wednesday in northern Egypt, a security official said.

The car rolled onto the roadside of the Cairo-Alexandria desert
highway before it was engulfed in fire, killing the 19-year-old
driver and a 55-year-old man. The three others suffered second- or

CAIRO, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs from
the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egypt and Libya have agreed to boost bilateral trade
especially in the domain of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed during a meeting of their joint expert
committee which wrapped up in Tripoli, Libya, on Tuesday to set up
special export outlets for the Egyptian agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
The committee agreed to exempt all Egyptian agricultural and
industrial exports to Libya, including those labelled with foreign
trade marks, from custom tariffs.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to sign two memorandums of understanding in
technical cooperation, exchange of expertise, trade negotiations,
commercial policies and organization of exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY -- The National Assembly (parliament) of Kuwait
ratified a bill allowing non-Gulf nationals direct access to invest
in the Kuwaiti Stock Exchange (KSE).
</P>
<P>
Previously, only nationals of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
were allowed to trade in the KSE. Non-GCC brokers could only deal
in Kuwaiti shares through joint investment funds.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- U.S. Export-Import Bank has approved 523 million U.S.
dollars in financing for two power projects in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. bank announced Tuesday that the U.S.-Turkish contractor
InterGen/Enka will use the financing to purchase equipment from U.
S. suppliers.
</P>
<P>
Enka, based in Istanbul, is a leading Turkish contractor and has
established alliances with a large number of international firms.
InterGen is a company created by Bechtel Enterprises, Inc. and

</P>
<P>
Along with another gas-fired power plant in Izmir, southwest
Turkey, the consortium will build altogether three power plants
with a total cost of 2.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Britain's third largest bank Barclays has applied to
the Turkish Treasury to open a representation in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Barclays Chairman Peter Middleton told reporters in Istanbul
Tuesday that Barclays would help finance Turkish companies through
institutional banking instead of individual banking.
</P>
<P>
Barclays hopes to double its profit in Turkey over four years.
Cem Atac, the bank's present consultant, will be appointed as the
representative to Turkey once the office is opened.

<HEADLINE> Peace Talks on Cyprus Issue Likely to Be Postponed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus House President Spyros
Kyprianou Wednesday said that it is highly likely the U.N.-
sponsored Cyprus peace talks scheduled to begin on May 23 will be
postponed due to President Glafcos Clerides' illness.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after visiting Clerides in a private clinic, Kyprianou
said everything depends on the president's health and the doctors
will have the last say as to whether or not Clerides could go to
New York for the talks.
</P>
<P>
Clerides was admitted to a private clinic in Nicosia on Monday,
where a polyp on his large intestine will be removed by surgery on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to Cyprus News Agency, Clerides has been told by his
doctors that it would be better he did not travel to New York for
the talks scheduled to start on May 23, in view of the operation.
</P>
<P>
The report said clerides had asked if it was possible to undergo
the operation after the talks, something both his doctors and
family disagreed with.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island after a failed coup seeking union with
Athens.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of proximity talks between the two communities, under
U.N. auspices, have already been held, aiming at paving the way for
substantial negotiations to reach a settlement in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Clerides, 81, will need six to eight weeks to recover fully,
including the fortnight he is expected to remain in the clinic
after the operation.

Wednesday voiced its "deep regret" at the killing of U.N.
peacekeepers in Sierra Leone while reiterating condemnation of "
the hostile and destructive actions" against the U.N. Mission in
the West African country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read to the press here, the president of the

Front) against UNAMSIL (the U.N. Mission in Sierra Leone) and
other international personnel," the statement said. "They demanded
that the RUF release all detainees and cease immediately its
hostile acts."
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President Andres Pastrana
and his Venezuelan counterpart, Hugo Chavez, will meet Thursday at
Colombia's Caribbean port of Santa Marta, capital of the state of
Magdalena.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will have an open agenda and be attended by the
entrepreneurial leaders and the chairmen of bilateral integration
and negotiation affairs, said Venezuelan Ambassador to Colombia
Fernando Gerbasi Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that both leaders will examine a reactivation of trade
between both of their countries and a new drive to the Community
of Andean Nations (CAN), made up by Colombia, Venezuela, Ecuador,
Peru and Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
The bloc registered last year a severe contraction due to
recession in Ecuador, Venezuela and Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Apart from economic issues, Pastrana and Chavez will analyze
political issues, such as the state of Colombia's peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents will examine the security situation in the
common border, which in the past has been affected by the raids of
Colombian guerrillas into Venezuelan territory. The military
commission of both countries will present information on the
matter.
</P>
<P>
The negotiation commission of sea territory, created to
mediate the differences between the two countries regarding the
maritime border demarcation, will meet for the first time since
1990, due to the presence of both heads of state.

<HEADLINE> Clark Replaced by Ralston at NATO European Command </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONS, Belgium, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Joseph Ralston replaced
Wednesday Wesley Clark at the NATO military command of the allied
force in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Ralston, the second man from the air force to hold the post of
Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR), said at the command hand-
over ceremony that he had a tough job ahead.
</P>
<P>
The 56-year-old United States air force general called on the
Western military alliance to remain united. He said later at a
press briefing that NATO's three biggest challenges were building
a better relationship with Russia, developing a NATO-European
Union security strategy and keeping an eye on the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
"NATO's strength is not in its military force but in the
unified spirit of a free European people," said Ralston. "It is
clear that by its very unity NATO has been a catalyst for peace,
stability, freedom and prosperity."
</P>
<P>
Ralston is an experienced combat pilot who flew some 150
missions during the Vietnam war.
</P>
<P>
Clark, the four-star United States army general, differed with
his superiors at the Pentagon during last year's 78-day NATO air
strikes against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia by seeking the
escalation of the bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
He was replaced three months ahead of his scheduled three-year
term as Supreme Allied Commander Europe.

<HEADLINE> Annan Expresses Outrage at "Deliberate Attacks" on U.N. Soldiers in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Wednesday expressed his outrage at "the continuing
deliberate attacks" on U.N. peacekeepers in Sierra Leone, saying
that former rebel leader Foday Sankoh is responsible for such acts.
</P>
<P>
A statement, issued here by his spokesman, said, "The
Secretary-General expressed his outrage at the continuing
deliberate attacks on United Nations personnel in Sierra Leone by
armed groups and individuals belonging to the Revolutionary United
Front (RUF)."
</P>
<P>
"Four soldiers from the Kenyan battalion of UNAMSIL (the U.N.
Mission in Sierra Leone) have lost their lives while three others
at least have been injured," the statement said. "A large number
of UNAMSIL personnel are still being detained by RUF elements or
are unaccounted for."
</P>
<P>
"The leader of the RUF, Mr. Foday Sankoh, is responsible for
their actions," the statement said. "He has ignored repeated
appeals by UNAMSIL to stop these attacks."
</P>
<P>
 "The Secretary-General demands the immediate cessation of
such hostile acts, and condemns in the strongest terms this
flagrant violation by Mr. Sankoh and the RUF of the Lome Agreement
and other related undertakings by RUF," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
 Sankoh and other leaders of the warring parties signed the
Lome Agreement in July last year to end the nine-year civil war in
the West African country, but little progress was made by the RUF
to carry out the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
 "The Secretary-General believes that all those responsible
for this unacceptable and criminal behavior, especially leaders
with authority, must be held accountable for their actions," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
 Voicing full support for Annan's statement, the president of
the U.N. Security Council for May, Wang Yingfan of China,
reiterated in a statement he read to the press here Wednesday that
the Council condemned "in strongest terms the hostile and
destructive" action staged by rebels in Sierra Leone, demanding
the early release of hostage and the bringing of those responsible
to justice.
</P>
<P>
 Seven U.N. peacekeepers have been killed in clashes with
rebels in Sierra Leone and some 50 others have been seized, a U.N.
spokeswoman said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Following the fighting that took place yesterday and earlier
today between U.N. troops and the Revolutionary United Front (RUF)
in the northern areas of Makeni and Magburaka, we can confirm that
seven U.N. soldiers have been killed," the spokeswoman, Marie
Okabe, told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
"As we announced to you earlier this morning, we can confirm
that about 50 U.N. personnel are being detained by the RUF, at
least 21 in the Makeni and Magburaka areas and 28 in the eastern
area of Kailahun," she said.
</P>
<P>
The detainees in the Makeni and Magburaka areas include three
U.N. military observers. The others held in Kailahun include eight
helicopter crew and two civilian members of the U.N. Mission in
Sierra Leone, known as the UNAMSIL, the spokeswoman said.

</P>
<P>
The Fed said that factories were running near capacity in some
areas as overall manufacturing activity was strong. Retailing and
commercial construction also were brisk, adding to the economy's
growth.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Commerce Department reported that new orders to
American factories bounced back in March, rising a bigger-than-
expected 2.2 percent, led by the largest jump in demand for
electronic equipment in more than two years.
</P>
<P>
The Fed survey, compiled from reports from its 12 regional
banks, also said "there were more frequent reports of intensifying
wage pressures as shortages of workers persisted in all districts.
"
</P>
<P>
But even against this backdrop, consumer prices remained
relatively well-behaved, the Fed said.
</P>
<P>
"Prices at the retail level remained relatively stable in most
areas, as competition and increased productivity reportedly helped
keep prices in check," the Fed said.
</P>
<P>
The survey will be used when Fed policy-makers meet on May 16
to review the central bank's stance on interest rates. It was
based on information collected before April 24.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has boosted interest rates five times by a
quarter-point each since June 30 in an effort to slow the red-hot
economy and keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
Even though those rate increases were designed to make
borrowing more expensive for American consumers and businesses,
they haven't had much impact in cooling demand. Given the outlook
for strong continuing growth, many analysts widely expect the Fed
will raise rates again at the May 16 meeting.

<HEADLINE> Romania's Population Diminishes in Past 10 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Romania's population has
constantly dropped in the past 10 years due to the negative trend
in the birth rate, the high death rate and high external migration,
the official Rompres news agency Wednesday quoted data of the
National Statistics Commission as reporting.
</P>
<P>
On January 1, 2000, Romania's population was a little bit
higher than 22.455 million, 33,100 persons less than on January 1,
1999.
</P>
<P>
The number of women is higher than that of men, both in the
total population and in the category of people aged more than 45
years, more evident for people aged more than 85.
</P>
<P>
The structure of the population on big age groups reflects the
continuation of the slow process of population aging because of
the drop in the birth rate in the first place, which led to an
absolute and relative diminution in the number of young people (0-
14 years) and a rise in the number of people aged more than 60.
</P>
<P>
Compared with January 1, 1999, the young population diminished
by 102,200 and the adult and old population rose by 22,800 and 46,
300 respectively.
</P>
<P>
About 12.3 million people live in towns, accounting for 54.8
percent of Romania's population.

<HEADLINE> EU OK's Greek Bid to Join Euro Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The European Union Wednesday
endorsed Greece's bid to join the union's 11-member single
currency club.
</P>
<P>
Pedro Solbes, EU commissioner in charge of economy and monetary
affairs, told the European Parliament's economic committee that
Greece had met all the necessary requirements on inflation,
deficit and debt for entry into the euro zone.
</P>
<P>
Greece is now expected to join the single currency mechanism in
January 2001, pending a final approval by the European Union
summit of heads of state and government in June.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner rejected criticism that Greek membership would
further drag down the euro that traded at a new record low of 89
cents against the United States dollar Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Solbes said that Greece's bid was based on the same economic
criteria as the other 11 European Union member states that are now
in the euro zone.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner, however, warned that Greece is still faced
with the risk of high inflation due to high interest rates and its
exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
The European Central Bank, based in Frankfurt of Germany, also
gave its endorsement Wednesday to Greece's bid to join the euro
zone.
</P>
<P>
The bank also expressed concerns about the country's inflation
and debt problems.
</P>
<P>
The countries that are currently in the single currency
mechanism are Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland,
Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain.

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The worldwide database software
market grew by 18 percent last year over 1998, thanks to the
growth of new Internet applications and rising demand for business
intelligence applications.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released Wednesday by U.S. market
research firm Dataquest, worldwide database software revenue
reached 8 billion U.S. dollars in 1999. The industry is forecast
to reach 12.7 billion dollars by 2004. Dataquest said that the
market will be driven by Internet-related applications, electronic
commerce, content management, integrated business intelligence,
and new mobile consumer and mobile business applications.
</P>
<P>
Oracle and IBM were the market leaders, with 30 percent of the
market, followed by Microsoft, with a 10 percent share.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier study by market analysis firm Forrester
Research, as more and more firms are building out their online
businesses, packaged e-commerce software spending by U.S.
companies will grow from 3.1 billion dollars in 1999 to 14.5
billion dollars in 2003.

<P>
HAVANA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Cuban and European Union (EU)
entrepreneurs will analyze Wednesday at the Cuban capital, during
a private session, proposals to promote corporate links, in spite
of the bilateral tense situation in political affairs.
</P>
<P>
During this round of business talks to start activities in the
Melia Cohiba Hotel and to close Friday, there will be
representatives of 76 small and medium-sized companies (PYMES)
from 13 EU countries and 131 Cuban entities.
</P>
<P>
Most of the participating companies represent the tourism and
construction sectors, but also the pharmaceuticals, energy,
agriculture, food, electronics and biotechnology sectors.
</P>
<P>
The forum is organized by the Latin American Commission of the
European Association for Small and Medium Business (EUROPMI) and
MINVEC's Investments Promotion Center.
</P>
<P>
This is the second meeting of the kind after 1996, when
business agreements summed up over 40 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
This meeting is coincidental with a moment of rough relations
between Cuba and the EU, due to the support of the European Union
countries to the recently approved resolution in the Human Rights
Commission, in Geneva, in which the island country is considered
to be violating human rights.
</P>
<P>
According to the most recent institutional figures, Cuba's
foreign trade volume in 1998 registered 5.143 billion U.S. dollars,
of which 48 percent was carried out with Europe.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are 242 exporting companies registered in this
Caribbean nation, 213 of which also carry out import operations.

<HEADLINE> Argentina, Uruguay Discuss Issue over Mercosur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The president of Argentina,
Fernando de la Rua, and Uruguay's former president, Julio Maria
Sanguinetti, expressed Wednesday optimism about the future of the
Southern Common Market (Mercosur).
</P>
<P>
At the end of the meeting with De la Rua, Sanguinetti said that
Mercosur grew during a prosperity period, while pessimism in the
interior of the bloc aroused right after the Brazilian crisis in
1999.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur has to direct itself towards three basic issues. The
first one is to hold a "macroeconomic coordination" in order to
overcome present situations and to prevent surprises to happen,
such as devaluation, he added.
</P>
<P>
The other two issues are to strengthen the institutionalization
of Mercosur and to underscore linking mechanisms with other
regional organisms, such as the European Union and the Free Trade
Area of the Americas (FTAA), proposed Uruguay's former leader.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur's members are Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay,
with Chile and Bolivia as associated members.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Go Ahead With Land Reform Without British Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
said Wednesday the land reform would go ahead without the fund
promised by the British government for compensating white
commercial farmers.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launching ceremony of the 2000 election
manifesto of the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic
Front (Zanu-pf), Mugabe said the British promise to fund the land
redistribution was a lie.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want their money. We just want our land back and from
our land we will get our money," he declared amid cheers from war
veterans and other high ranking party officials attending the
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the ruling party's election manifesto is that
"Land is the economy and the economy is land".
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said there was no going back on the land issue which had
remained an emotive one since the country gained independence in
1980.
</P>
<P>
"If they are finding it difficult to give us 841 farms then we
will take measures to make it easier for them to give us back
these farms," he said.
</P>
<P>
The 62-page Zanu-pf election manifesto outlined how the party
intended to tackle the land issue, maintain peace and stability,
overcome economic hardships, eradicate poverty, create jobs and
empower the indigenous business community and women.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean parliament dominated by the ruling Zanu-pf party has
already approved a new law to acquire, without compensation, some
half of the 12 million hectares of farm land in the hands of about
4,500 white farmers.
</P>
<P>
The process of acquiring the land and redistributing it is
expected to begin this month, ahead of elections expected in June.
</P>
<P>
The independence war veterans have occupied some 1,000 white
farms since February to force the government to accelerate land
reform.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan President Calls for Mass Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni
strongly defended the Universal Primary Education (UPE) Program,
saying that mass education is the tool to banishing illiteracy
and ignorance and to developing the east African country.
</P>
<P>
Museveni made the remarks in Ntungamo town on Wednesday,
according to a press release from the President's Office.
</P>
<P>
The policy of the colonial and post-independence governments
concentrated on education for only those in higher institutions of
learning, said Museveni.
</P>
<P>
"The policy which has left a mass of uneducated Ugandans has
not helped the country to develop and has retarded Africa's
development," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Since Uganda launched the UPE program in January 1997, pupil
enrolment skyrocketed from 2.5 million to 6.5 million this year.
</P>
<P>
The UPE program, which provides free primary school education
for four children in each family, aims to reduce illiteracy rate
and widespread poverty.
</P>
<P>
At president more than 40 percent of the population is still
illiterate in the country.

DAR ES SALAAM, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian President and
chairman of the ruling party Chama cha Mapinduzi (CCM) Benjamin
Mkapa on Wednesday formally start running for the second five-year
term in the general elections to be held on October 29.
</P>
<P>
At a brief ceremony held at the CCM National Executive
Committee building in the central town of Dodoma, Mkapa received
the presidential nomination forms from the ruling party's
Secretary-General Philip Mangula after paying the required one
million shillings (about 1,250 U.S. dollars) fee.
</P>
<P>
In his address, Mkapa said he has decided to stand for the
presidency so that he could accomplish his unfinished works.
However, he admitted it was not an easy thing for him to make the
decision due to challenges ahead.
</P>
<P>
He thanked CCM members and supporters for appreciating what he
has achieved so far. He believed he had won a strong support from
CCM members and all Tanzanians.
</P>
<P>
Before collecting the forms, CCM elders read a message to Mkapa
in which they said they appreciated his achievement so far and
would like him to vie so that he could accomplish his mission.
</P>
<P>
The nomination forms must be returned to the CCM secretary
general by May 21. Mkapa is the first CCM member to declare
candidacy. In the last elections in 1995, 13 CCM members,
including one woman, sought nomination for president. Mkapa won
the final victory after defeating three candidates from the
opposition.
</P>
<P>
The election in October will be the second multi-party election
in Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Namibia to Pay Families of Dead Soldiers Killed in Congo </HEADLINE>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Namibia is to pay a total of
nine million Namibian dollars (about 1.3 million U.S. dollars) to
the families of 36 soldiers who died in fighting in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC), a Namibian newspaper reported on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Namibian Defence Ministry official Erastus
 Negonga as saying that the families of the 36 dead soldiers will
receive 250,000 Namibian dollars each (37,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
It is the first time the government has revealed how many of
its soldiers have been killed in the DRC since Namibia joined
Zimbabwe and Angola in August 1998 in backing DRC President
Laurent Kabila to fight against the rebels backed by Uganda and
Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
Media reports said that most of the deceased were killed in
combat and others died in aircraft accidents, accidental drownings
or from malaria.
</P>
<P>
He also confirmed that compensation will be paid to soldiers
who had suffered "permanent disability" such as the loss of limbs
while serving in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that a total of 2,000 Namibian soldiers are
still serving in the DRC.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Press Protests Scapegoat-taking by Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Journalists in Nigeria have challenged
the country's leadership in three arms of the federal government
to be more civilized in resolving their conflicts, rather than
blaming the press for illustrating their inadequacies.
</P>
<P>
In a communique, which became available to Xinhua on Wednesday,
some of the country's press professionals said the three arms,
the executive, legislative, and judiciary, should show maturity
when dissolving their differences under the new democratic system
instead of trying to block the mouth of the journalists.
</P>
<P>
The document was an outcome of a meeting of the Nigerian Union
of Journalists (NUJ) at the weekend in a Western Nigerian town of
Abeokuta.
</P>
<P>
The union said in the document that it "believes in the unity
of the Nigerian nation and the growth of its nascent democracy''.
And it would resist attempts to the press by certain interest
groups to derail the hardly earned democracy.
</P>
<P>
The communique was apparently a response to recent criticism by
both the executive and legislative branches of the government.
</P>
<P>
The two top branches of the federal government were lately
entangled in high profile squabbles on questions like the federal
budget for year 2000, and the impeachment moves against President
Olusegun Obasanjo or Senate President, Chuba Okadigbo.
</P>
<P>
Both parties, taking pain to patch up their differences these
days, blamed the press for "blowing the quarrel out of
proportion''.

<HEADLINE> Israeli State Comptroller Asks for More Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli State Comptroller Eliezer
Goldberg on Wednesday asked Prime Minister Ehud Barak to authorize
the State Comptroller's Office greater power of enforcement.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference for releasing the second part of his annual
report for the year 1999, Goldberg revealed that he will discuss
the issue with Minister in the Prime Minister's Office Haim Ramon,
one of Barak's closest confidants.
</P>
<P>
Under the current State Comptroller's Act, Goldberg said, his
office is seen by some as little more than a toothless tiger and
this situation should be amended.
</P>
<P>
Local political analysts said the annual report is usually
accompanied by sharp criticism of government ministries, but it
does not carry any legal weight and only serves as an audit of the
performance of government agencies.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the report is rarely followed by serious changes, even in
the government sectors directly targeted by the report.
</P>
<P>
In some extreme cases, the comptroller could only turn over the
evidence of most serious conducts, such as dereliction of duty or
corruption, to the attorney general, as was the case in the general
election funding case involving Barak's One Israel coalition in
January, which led to a criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
The 872-page document released Wednesday afternoon on the
website of the office is the first report to deal with the activity
of the Barak administration, which came to power last July.
</P>
<P>
Goldberg had presented it to the Knesset (parliament) Speaker
Avraham Burg on Wednesday morning and will submit it to President
Ezer Weizman on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The report covered all the economic, social and administrative
issues relating to government ministries and state institutions,
highlighting the worsening quality of drinking water, the interior
ministry's mismanagement of millions of shekels, and the poor
running of Israeli diplomatic missions in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The document published on Wednesday is the second part of the
annual report. Goldberg had presented the first half last October,
which dealt primarily with the management of the security
establishment.
</P>
<P>
Goldberg split the report into two parts, the first time in
Israel's history, reportedly to make it easier for the public and
media to study the findings.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urged to Influence Turkey over Cyprus Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. should exert its influence
on Turkey to see that it adopts a "constructive and positive"
position on the Cyprus issue, current European Union (EU)
President, Portuguese Foreign Minister Jaime Gama said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Gama arrived in Cyprus Tuesday for a 24-hour visit.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Cyprus Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides,
Gama said that the EU has already met a U.S. goal regarding
Turkey's European aspirations by nominating that country an EU
candidate.
</P>
<P>
The EU at its Helsinki summit last December granted Turkey EU
candidacy. It also confirmed that Cyprus' EU accession can be
achieved even if the Cyprus issue is not settled.
</P>
<P>
Gama, who arrived here Tuesday for a 24-hour visit, stressed the
importance of the EU decision to accept Cyprus, who applied for EU
membership in 1990 and started substantive accession negotiations
with the EU in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern part of the island in the wake of a failed coup seeking
union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Gama reiterated that no separate negotiations can take place
with the Turkish Cypriot community but stressed the need to inform
the Turkish Cypriots about the merits of accession and the Union's
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese Foreign Minister said his country is very
interested in development in the Cyprus issue and its accession
process.
</P>
<P>
"The purpose of my visit is to reaffirm the commitment to the
strategy we adopted in Helsinki and with the enlargement
procedures," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides said he discussed with Gama efforts to solve the
Cyprus issue, EU-related matters and developments in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
Gama left here Wednesday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Says 3 Injured in U.S., British Bombings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Three Iraqi civilians were injured in
U.S. and British warplanes' bombings in northern and southern Iraq,
said a spokesman for the Iraqi air defense command.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 12:15 (0815 GMT), eight formations of
U.S. and British planes made 16 armed sorties over the northern
provinces of Dohuk, Neiveva and Erbil, bombing civilian and service
installations and injuring three people.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that at 11:00 (0700 GMT), 13 U.S. and
British formations made 26 armed sorties from Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait over the southern provinces of Basra, Misan, Thi-Qar,
Qadissiyah, Wasit, Muthana and Najaf.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi air defense artillery fired at the planes and forced
them to flee back to their bases in Turkey, Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Since the United States and Britain launched the Operation
Desert Fox air strikes against Iraq in December 1998, their
warplanes have made a total of 20,847 sorties, among them 3,856
from Turkey and 16,991 from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, over the two
so-called no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq, said the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British planes have been enforcing the two no-fly zones
with the claimed aim to protect the Shiite Muslims and Kurds from
the forces of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Iraq never recognizes the zones, set up by the U.S. and its
allies in the aftermath of the 1991 Gulf War, for lack of proper U.
N. authorization.
</P>
<P>
It has confronted with the U.S. and British planes since
December 1998 by targeting the aircraft with surface-to-air

<HEADLINE> Kuwait For Conditional Lifting of Sanctions on Iraq  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait was ready to see the lifting of
decade-old international sanctions on Iraq, but Baghdad must
implement U.N. resolutions and release Kuwaiti prisoners of war
(POW), Speaker of the Kuwaiti National Assembly Jasim Al-Kharafi
said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kharafi said Kuwait sympathizes with the sufferings of the Iraqi
people under the crippling sanctions, but accused "the regime of
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein" of continuing to "create troubles
for Kuwait."
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a press conference on the sidelines of
the ongoing 103rd conference of the Inter-Parliamentary Union
(IPU), which opened here last Saturday to discuss world peace and
security and ways of promoting dialogues between cultures and
civilizations.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti speaker said it was high time to solve problems
facing Kuwaiti-Iraqi ties, and Kuwait is concerned with the fate of
605 Kuwait POWs it believed to be still in Iraqi custody, and Iraq
should release them according to relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has denied on various occasions that it was still keeping
any Kuwaiti POWs.
</P>
<P>
Kharafi said Kuwait supports the idea of holding an Arab summit
to discuss issues of common concern to Arab countries, and it would
not boycott such a summit if Iraq also takes part.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait hopes that such an Arab summit would focus on the ties
between Kuwait and Iraq, he added.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's ties with all Gulf states, except Kuwait, have been
improving a decade after the Gulf crisis, triggered by Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The IPU, founded in 1889 and now has 144 members, is the largest
international parliamentary organization.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Plane Refused to Land at Gaza Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Israel on Wednesday refused landing
permission to an Egyptian passenger plane at Palestinian-controlled
Gaza airport, an official of Egypt's Civil Aviation Authority said.
</P>
<P>
EgyptAir flight 819, which flies to Gaza every week, took off
from Cairo International Airport at 11:00 local time (0800 GMT),
carrying 32 passengers, Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted the
unnamed official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing 737 had to return to Cairo after it was intercepted
by two Israeli fighters without reasons, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He accused Israel of creating problems as the Egyptian civilian
plane was flying on a normal path.
</P>
<P>
"It seems that the Israelis intend to create a problem over the
Gaza airport, since it has been agreed that planes should go from
Egypt to Gaza airport at a point about 50 kilometers north of el-
Arish (in northern Sinai) and this zone has been declared
internationally," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Israel denied landing permission to a Moroccan plane
at the Gaza airport, the official added.
</P>
<P>
Reports have said that the Egyptian plane was refused to land at
the Gaza airport because it was using a new air corridor recently
introduced by Egypt to replace the old route north of el-Arish. But
Israel has not agreed to the change.
</P>
<P>
Israel controls the Gaza Strip's airspace under interim peace
agreements with the Palestine Liberation Organization.

<HEADLINE> Syrian-Egyptian-Saudi FMs Meeting Starts in Tadmur </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministers of Syria, Egypt
and Saudi Arabia started their meeting for coordination and
consultation in the central Syrian city of Tadmur Wednesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is to review the developments of the Middle East
peace process, particularly the Syrian-Israeli track, frozen since
January 10, and the scheduled Israeli withdrawal from south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
It also discusses Arab issues including ways of enhancing the
Arab joint actions.
</P>
<P>
The meeting derives its significance from the influence of its
participating countries and their continuous efforts to activate
the Arab joint actions, serve the common national interests of the
Arab countries, restore the occupied Arab lands and establish peace
and stability in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Before the meeting, Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh told
reporters that the chances to reach peace with Israel were still
there and the contacts did not stop.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said the meeting would
discuss arrangements for the coming Arab summit. He expressed
Egypt's support for the Syrian position on the necessity of
Israel's withdrawal from the Golan Heights to the borders of June
4, 1967.
</P>
<P>
The possibility to hold an Egyptian-Syrian summit is always
there, Moussa noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an Egyptian official said in Cairo on Wednesday that
President Hosni Mubarak and his Syrian counterpart Hafez al-Assad
would meet in Sharm el-Sheikh next Monday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal of Saudi Arabia, a heavyweight
in the Gulf, attended the meeting Wednesday.

TEHRAN, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran's elite Islamic Revolutionary

</P>
<P>
He said the third one will be held on May 21-25 by the armored
division in Najafabad, the central Isfahan province.

<HEADLINE> 2 More Iranian Jews Confess to Spying for Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Two more Iranian Jews charged with
spying confessed in the third closed-door court hearing on
Wednesday that they had passed information to Israel's Mossad
secret service.
</P>
<P>
Ramin Nematizadeh and Shahroqh Paknahad accepted all the charges
against them at a revolutionary court after Hamid Tefilin, the
chief suspect confessed to espionage for Israel on Monday, the
Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Paknahad said that his mission at the espionage network had been
collection of information from military centers, public places and
important centers in Iran for the Israeli intelligence services.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the court hearing in Shiraz, the
south Fars province, he said that since 1987 he had been
responsible for encouraging Jewish students residing in Iran to
illegally migrate to Israel.
</P>
<P>
"In the same year I provided Israeli intelligence service
(Mossad) with information on sensitive military, security and
medicare centers, including information on Shiraz Moslemin hospital
and the information was used against Iran during the 1980-88 Iran-
Iraq war," he said.
</P>
<P>
Paknahad said that in the third court hearing he and his
attorney had been informed by the judge of six charges brought up
against him and he had admitted all of them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Nematizadeh also confessed in court to selling
piecemeal information he gathered while in the central city of
Isfahan.
</P>
<P>
The 13 Iranian Jews were charged with espionage, acts
endangering national security, cooperation with Israeli
intelligence service Mossad and furnishing information to a foreign
country resulting in damage to the state.
</P>
<P>
Israel has denied the Iranian Jews were spying for the Jewish
state, which Iran fiercely opposes, and condemned the confession
as "coerced."
</P>
<P>
"The accusations against them are cruel lies, once again we are
in a situation where Jews are imprisoned just because they are
Jews," Israel's Minister without Portfolio Michael Melchior said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Iranian judicial officials have promised a fair and impartial
trial for the 13 Jews who were arrested in March and April last
year with eight Muslims in Shiraz, Fars province, the center of
Iran's 35,000-strong Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
Some Western countries expressed concern over the trial and
demanded the release of the Jews, but Tehran rejected any "foreign
interference" in the trial.

<HEADLINE> Dialogue Conducive to World Peace: Chinese Delegate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, May 3 (Xinhua) -- China believes that dialogue between
different cultures and civilizations is conducive to world peace
and stability as well as progress and development of human
societies, a senior Chinese delegate said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Kong Xiangyou, member of the Chinese delegation, made the remark
at the ongoing general debates of the 103rd conference of the
Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU).
</P>
<P>
He said that the elements of culture are playing an increasingly
obvious role in international relations as the world is witnessing
the emergence of a multipolar system with peace and development as
the dominating trend in world affairs.
</P>
<P>
Kong said it is of special significance that IPU has chosen
dialogue between different cultures and civilizations as one of its
major themes at the current session as the world community is
increasingly concerned with the relationship between culture and
development.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that China stands for dialogues between different
civilizations, which it believes would help cultivate
understanding, tolerance and peaceful coexistence of peoples in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The 103rd IPU conference, opened here on Sunday, entered general
debates on Monday on the two major themes of world peace and
stability, and dialogue between different cultures and
civilizations.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Cai Fangbo, another member of the Chinese
delegation, also delivered a speech at the general debate session.
</P>
<P>
Cai called for the establishment of a new world political and
economic order which is based on multipolarity, the Five Principles
of Peaceful Coexistence, the charter and principles of the United
Nations and other well-recognized norms governing international
relations.
</P>
<P>
IPU, founded in 1889 and now with 144 members, is the largest

<HEADLINE> Lending To Homebuyers In UK Rises A Third In March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The annual rate of house price
inflation in Britain accelerated from 16.2 percent to 17.5 percent
last month, its highest level for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
Gross mortgage lending by British banks hit 6.5 billion pounds
in March, 30 percent up on February and the highest figure since
late last autumn, said the British Bankers' Association (BBA).
</P>
<P>
The cost of the average home rose by 1,500 pounds last month --
50 pounds a day -- to reach 80,893 pounds, according to the latest
data from the Nationwide Building Society.
</P>
<P>
It warned that the current rate of house price inflation was "
not sustainable," and it called on lenders to exercise caution and
avoid encouraging borrowers to overstretch themselves.
</P>
<P>
Some observers said that beneath these headline figures could
be detected signs that the housing market might be starting to
slow.
</P>
<P>
While clearly a substantial rise, the March surge in mortgage
lending was not as strong as that notched up during the
corresponding period in 1999, when the increase was 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the new mortgage figures may strengthen the argument
for an increase in interest rates when the Bank of England
Monetary Policy Committee meets this week.

MOSCOW, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The presidents of Russia, Ukraine and
Belarus gathered Wednesday in the Russian town of Prokhorovka in
Russia's southwestern Belgorod region to mark the 55th anniversary
of the victory over Nazi Germany.
</P>
<P>
Prokhorovka was the venue of a famous tank battle between the
Soviet Union and Nazi Germany on July 12, 1943. More than 700
soldiers perished in fighting at the Kursk Bulge.
</P>
<P>
Russian President-elect Vladimir Putin, Ukrainian President
Leonid Kuchma and Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko
unveiled a war monument.
</P>
<P>
Putin said the victory over the Nazis had been underpinned by
the unity of the country and primarily of the fraternal Slav
nations who showed mass heroism.
</P>
<P>
"This is our undying memory; this is the priceless thing which
should bring us together rather than put us apart," he said.
</P>
<P>
Putin said the thankful posterity would never forget the labor
and military feats accomplished by the people during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma, for his part, said people of the three countries "must
remember those who perished and care about those who survived."
</P>
<P>
He called for the strengthening of economic interaction and
more attention to concrete problems and business cooperation
rather than dwelling on differences.
</P>
<P>
Lukashenko described the disintegration of the Soviet Union as
the "biggest mistake" of the past century. He said 30 million
Soviet people sacrificed their lives for the victory of the Great
Patriotic War and the unity of the motherland but "we politicians
failed to protect it during the peace times."
</P>
<P>
He said the younger generations should be educated on the
patriotic spirit.
</P>
<P>
"The great feat performed by Russians, Belarussians and
Ukrainians requires each of us to remember the lessons of the past,
" Lukashenko said. "It must never come back again."

<HEADLINE> FM: Georgia Will Not Lease Base After Russian Departure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Georgian Foreign Minister Irakly
Menagarishvili said Wednesday that the Vaziani military base will
not be leased to any other country following the Russian
withdrawal in one and a half years.
</P>
<P>
He said some real property and infrastructure of the base will
be used by the Georgian armed forces and the rest will change its
functions and will be employed for peaceful needs, the Interfax
news agency reported in a dispatch from Tbilisi, capital of the
former Soviet republic.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the military airfield in Vaziani might be
converted into a civilian airport and that foreign firms,
including Russian ones, could apply for the project.
</P>
<P>
He noted that since the Soviet troops were withdrawn from
Georgia in the early 1990s, two military airfields in western
Georgia have been employed for peaceful needs.
</P>
<P>
Menagarishvili denied the assumption that the Russian military
base in Vaziani may be turned into one for Turkey or another NATO
member country.
</P>
<P>
Tbilisi has been trying to join the North Atlantic Organization
Treaty.
</P>
<P>
The decision to shut down two out of four Russian military
bases in Georgia, in Vaziani and Gudauta, Abkhazia, was taken at a
summit of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE) in Istanbul in November of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made within the framework of the adapted
Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe. Under the treaty,
Russia commits itself to the reduction of certain arms and
materiel on its flanks, including those in Georgia, Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> Moscow Blasts Latvian President Remarks on Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Foreign Ministry reacted
angrily Wednesday to a statement by Latvian President Vaira Vike-
Freiberga about what she described as threat from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Vike-Freiberga's comments were "unprecedented in their anti-
Russian tone" and "followed the worst Cold War traditions," the
ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The document was made in response to remarks made by the
Latvian president last Sunday to the British Broadcasting
Corporation that Russia might use force against the three Baltic
states -- Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia.
</P>
<P>
Vike-Freiberga "suspected Russia of making plans of attacking
her country and decided to tell the whole world about them" in the
interview, the Russian statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Without putting forth any serious reasons -- and there can be
none -- the president of the neighboring country decided to
interpret Moscow's recently approved military doctrine in her own
way," the Interfax news agency quoted the statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the BBC interview, Vike-Freiberga expressed concern over the
foreign policy stance adopted by Russia since Vladimir Putin was
elected president and said that Russia's recent aggressive
statements hark back to Cold War confrontation.
</P>
<P>
She warned that any Russian attack on Latvia would be an
indirect attack on NATO and the European community, according to a
report on the BBC website.
</P>
<P>
Latvia has been working hard to join NATO.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Ministry described Vike-Freiberga's remarks
as "crude and unfriendly rhetoric against Russia... used to
substantiate NATO membership for Latvia as the only alternative."
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Russia's new military doctrine is
purely defensive and not directed against other countries.
</P>
<P>
"That is how the world regards it. However, this made no
impression on the Latvian president, who set free her evidently
rich imagination," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It is not the first time that Riga has tried to paint Russia as
an enemy "to distract Latvian and international public opinion
from domestic problems," the document said.
</P>
<P>
"The deepening problems in ethnic relations" are becoming
increasingly evident to the Latvian and international public and
this is one of the causes, it said.
</P>
<P>
The statement accused Latvia of continuing "to crudely violate
the rights of ethnic minorities in language use and education
registered in Council of Europe and OSCE documents."
</P>
<P>
It said Latvia is very slow in granting citizenship to hundreds
of thousands of its permanent residents and numerous significant
differences remain between the rights of citizens and non-citizens.
</P>
<P>
However, the statement said that Moscow "favors friendly,
mutually beneficial relations with Latvia and is ready for such."
</P>
<P>
The ball is in Riga's court, which "should give up past
stereotypes and develop its domestic and foreign policies on the
generally recognized principles of the civilized world," the
statement said.

<HEADLINE> UN Asked to Chair DRC Peace Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 3 (Xinhua) -- President of United Democratic
Movement, South Africa's opposition party, Bantu Holomisa on
Wednesday called for a United Nations-sponsored peace summit on
the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
The summit, which should involve all the warring parties
including the DRC's three rebel groups, could possibly be chaired
by UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Holomisa said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He said the summit should sustain the existing ceasefire or
work vigorously for immediate cessation of hostilities in the DRC
in the event of it being threatened or violated.
</P>
<P>
Holomisa said a "remarkable feature" of the recent summit on
the DRC, held in Algeria and attended by South African President
Thabo Mbeki, his Nigerian counterpart Olusegun Obasanjo and DRC
President Laurent Kabila, was the absence of the three DRC rebel
groups and their backers and Kabila' s Angolan, Namibian and
Zimbabwean allies.
</P>
<P>
This was a cause of "grave concern", he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 3 (Xinhua) -- South African National Defense
Force's role in the U.N. peacekeeping operations in the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) is likely to be a preparatory one, a
senior government official said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Director General of South African Foreign Affairs
Department Welile Nhlapo said South Africa is the only African
state with the expertise required to prepare for the deployment of
peace troops in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
"We know that the United Nations is interested in some of the
technical expertise we have that will be much needed for the
preparation phase before the deployment of troops," he told
reporters in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Nhlapo declined to reveal what nature of the technical
expertise will be, but confirmed that DRC President Laurent Kabila
no longer has any reservations about South Africa's role in the
U.N. peacekeeping operations in his country.
</P>
<P>
"The question of whether or not South Africa is going there is
now behind us. President Mbeki has made that firm commitment and
it is going to happen," Nhlapo said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the U.N. peacekeeping operations will get
underway once a status of forces of agreement is signed by Kabila
and the U.N., which is likely to happen this week.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will provide the establishment of a U.N. field
headquarters in the DRC and determine areas where the deployment
of peace troops will be organized from.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of peacekeeping mission in the DRC will see the
arrival of 500 military observers, while the second phase will
bring in a protection force of about 5,000 troops and in the
third phase, further peacekeeping forces will be deployed.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Parliament to Supervise Flood Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican parliament on
Wednesday passed a resolution on this year's devastating flood in
the country, mandating the Assembly's Social Affairs Commission to
follow all activities of the government in support of the flood
victims.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was first discussed weeks ago, when the
opposition Renamo party tried to set up a separate parliament
commission to supervise flood relief.
</P>
<P>
The majority Frelimo party threw this proposal out, regarding
it as unnecessary to set up a new body, when emergency relief and
resettling flood victims clearly fell within the remit of the
Social Affairs Commission.
</P>
<P>
All 132 Frelimo deputies approved the resolution, with all 110
Renamo deputies present abstaining.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal Mocumbi said on Monday the
flood in February and March left 700 dead and a further 100 people
missing as well as 500,000 displaced.
</P>
<P>
President Joaquim Chissano has flown to Europe where he will
address a donors' conference in Rome later this week, seeking 450
million U.S. dollars for reconstruction.

<HEADLINE> Mugabe Lambastes West Media For Unfair Coverage Of Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
Wednesday castigated west news power houses for unfair coverage
of Zimbabwe, particularly on the sensitive and emotive land
issue.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, who was launching his ruling Zanu-pf party's manifesto
with the theme of "Land is the economy and the economy is land",
said the foreign press supported white commercial farmers who
owned vast tracts of fertile farm land than the landless
majority.
</P>
<P>
"And you think the fight will be won on the CNN or BBC... the
fight will be won here. Our people know us better and we will
serve the interest of our people," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Cable News Network and the British Broadcasting
Corporation were interested in giving extensive coverage to the
deaths of white farmers than blacks who were also victims of
violence perpetrated by the opposition Movement for Democratic
Change.
</P>
<P>
He said there was a vicious campaign by these news power houses
to discredit and have the international community apply sanctions
on Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
He also castigated the South African press for trying to strain
 relations between Harare and Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said his government supported war veterans and there was
no way it could let the police to bar them from occupying the
farms.
</P>
<P>
The war veterans have occupied about 1,000 white farms since
February.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said they would only leave the farms after 841 farms
have been acquired for resettling thousands of landless peasants.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Scoffs at Commonwealth Criticism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean Foreign Affairs Minister
Stan Mudenge on Wednesday scoffed at the Commonwealth's criticism,
saying " silence is golden" for the Commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
An eight-nation Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG)
voiced concerns on Tuesday over "the ongoing violence, loss of
life, illegal occupations of property, failure to uphold the rule
of law and political intimidation" in the run-up to the elections.
</P>
<P>
The minister told reporters here that the CMAG, which monitors
human rights and democracy in Commonwealth states and comprises
ministers from eight nations, acted out of its terms of reference
when it discussed the Zimbabwe situation which was not on its
agenda.
</P>
<P>
"I am tempted to advise my friends in the CMAG that, for
goodness sake, if you have run out of things to say remember
silence is golden," he said.
</P>
<P>
CMGA Chairman and Botswana's Foreign Minister Momphati Merafine
said in a statement after a meeting in London on Tuesday that
ministers had voiced concern about violence in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
He said the ministers were concerned with the loss of life,
illegal occupations of property, failure to uphold the rule of law
and political intimidation.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge said, "CMGA has chosen to evade addressing the root
cause of the present situation in Zimbabwe which is the refusal by
Britain to honor its colonial obligation on fair distribution of
land."
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe has been rocked by political violence in the run up to
 parliamentary elections originally scheduled for April.
</P>
<P>
The violence also occurred at white-owned commercial farms that
were invaded by war veterans calling for quick land
redistribution.
</P>
<P>
Mudenge said the exact date for Zimbabwe's fifth parliamentary
elections would be set after the Delimitation Commission finished
drawing up new constituencies.
</P>
<P>
The commission had indicated it needed at least three months
from late April to finish its work.

tightening up export controls on Zimbabwe to condemn President
Robert Mugabe for creating a "condition of crisis."

<P>
In a statement to parliament, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook

reform only to create a condition of crisis in which it can secure
its re-election," Cook said.

license applications for arms and military equipment to Zimbabwe,
including spare parts for British-made Hawk jets.

<P>
LONDON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Nelson Mandela has
told British Prime Minister Tony Blair that he backs Britain's
policy over Zimbabwe's land reform, Blair's spokesman said on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the talks between Mandela and Blair was held
when Mandela came to London to be made an Honorary Queen's Counsel
-- an award usually given to academic lawyers in recognition of
their work.
</P>
<P>
The former South African president was also quoted as saying
that his successor, Thabo Mbeki, had a key role to play in contact
with Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
"Nelson Mandela said he supported our approach and said he
believed dialogue with Zimbabwe should continue and that President
Thabo Mbeki had a key role to play in contact with Harare," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Blair used his hour of talks to outline his Zimbabwe policy and
expressed concerns over violence which has left at least 18 people
dead. The two also talked about the peace process in the central
African country of Burundi, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela is to be honored at a ceremony in the House of Lords on
Wednesday. Queen Elizabeth has given her permission for Mandela to
receive the honor as a special tribute to his role as a reconciler
in post-apartheid South Africa.

<HEADLINE> 17 Lebanese Injured in Israeli Air Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Seventeen Lebanese civilians,
including six children, were injured in Israel's bombardment in the
village of Habush in south Lebanon Wednesday afternoon, Oriental
Radio quoted security sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
The sources said Israeli warplanes launched four attacks on the
villages of Arab Saolim and Habush with eight air-to-ground
missiles.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese President Emile Lahoud said Israel has no excuse to
evade responsibility for the crime against Lebanese civilians, and
announced Lebanese government will cover the medical treatment of
the injured.
</P>
<P>
Israel has begun dismantling its military installations on
Tuesday, in preparation for the withdrawal of its occupation forces
from the region by July.
</P>
<P>
It has occupied parts of south Lebanon since 1978 and set up the
so-called "security zone" in 1985 with the excuse of protecting its
northern settlements from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Muslim guerrilla group Hezbollah, or Party of God support by
Iran and Syria, has since been leading a war of attrition aimed to
oust the Israeli troops and their proxy South Lebanon Army.

<P>
CAIRO, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
flew to Damascus on Wednesday for a meeting with his Syrian and
Saudi counterparts to coordinate stances on the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
During his two-day visit, Moussa will discuss with Faruk Shareh
and Saud Al-Faisal the latest developments of the Arab-Israeli
peace talks, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Reports have said that the ministers, whose countries play a
leading role in Arab politics, would seek a common position on the
Syrian-Israeli negotiations and also Israel's planned withdrawal
from south Lebanon by July.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters upon departure that the meeting comes
within the framework of the continued consultations among the three
Arab heavyweights on the international, regional and Arab issues of
mutual interest.
</P>
<P>
He added that the meeting will also deal with the current
situation in the Arab world, especially restoration of Arab
solidarity.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli talks have stalled since January due to
disputes over Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights that the
Jewish state occupied from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War, and
control of water resources.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel has decided to pull back from south Lebanon by
July even without a peace agreement with Syria and Lebanon. Israel
carved out a border strip in south Lebanon in 1985 as security zone
to allegedly protect its northern areas from cross-border attacks
by Lebanese Muslim guerrillas.

<HEADLINE> Second Hearing on Suspects in Reformist Shooting Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran's Islamic revolution court
Wednesday held a second hearing on the suspects in the
assassination attempt on a prominent reformist in mid March.
</P>
<P>
The judge then announced to adjourn the trial till next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The attacker Saeed Asgar, 20, appeared before the court and
pleaded guilty, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Also present were some of the other suspects involved in the
case. Medical examinations on the suspects indicated that they were
mentally fit, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Iranian authorities have so far arrested 10 people in connection
with the assassination attempt on Saeed Hajjarian on March 12. But
the report did not say how many of them appeared before the court
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The judge also summoned two witnesses, Mohammad Mohammad Zadeh
and Hassan Fattah. Both testified that they saw Saeed Asgar, a
chemistry student of a Tehran university, opened fire on Hajjarian
and fled the scene on a motorcycle driven by another defendant.
</P>
<P>
The first trial was held on April 25.
</P>
<P>
Although reformists suggest that the assassination was a
political plot and those who were responsible are still at large,
the judiciary concludes that the assassin shot Hajjarian out of
personal feelings and has no political background.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian, managing director of the now banned reformist daily
Sobh-e Emrouz (This Morning) and a former deputy intelligence
minister, played an important role in the reformists' landslide
victory in February parliamentary elections, which humiliated the
powerful conservatives.
</P>
<P>
He was shot in the face on March 12 in front of the Tehran
municipal council, where he was vice chairman. He was also a close
adviser to President Mohammad Khatami.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian was in a coma for quite a few days before regaining
his consciousness. On Tuesday, he met with the president and called
on his reformist allies to keep patient and calm to avoid radical
confrontation with conservatives before the new parliament convenes
at the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
The conservatives, who still dominate most of the powerful state
organs, mounted a crackdown on reformists by nullifying election
results in some constituencies, arresting reformist journalists and
closing 16 reformist publications.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian is expected to be released from hospital on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Progress Made in Implementing Chemical Weapons Convention: OPCW </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) affirmed here Wednesday
that encouraging progress has been made in the implementation of
the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC).
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Singapore Regional Forum 2000 on CWC
implementation, which attracted more than 30 experts from 25
countries, OPCW Deputy Secretary-General John Gee said progress
has been made toward achieving universality of the CWC and in
building OPCW and encouraging developments have been seen in
implementing the CWC which came into force on April 29, 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said the OPCW now has 135 member states, accounting for two-
thirds of all the states that comprise the international community
of nations, another 37 states have signed the convention but not
yet ratified it and only 21 states have neither ratified nor
signed the convention.
</P>
<P>
With all the permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, as
well as others with a major chemical industry, and all of the most
populous nations of the world, the member states of the OPCW
represent more than 90 percent of the world's population of more
than 6 billion, Gee said.
</P>
<P>
On destruction and verification of chemical weapons, Gee said
the world's largest known chemical weapons stockpiles in the
Russian Federation and the United States have been brought under
the convention's verification and destruction regime.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the OPCW has carried out about 700 inspections in
the past three years, Gee said the OPCW Secretariat has carried
out fewer industry inspections than planned, especially in the
last two years.
</P>
<P>
This is because of the absence of initial industry declarations
from the United States of America, he said, noting that the first
part of the long-awaited initial declarations for the U.S.
chemical industry was received by the OPCW last Friday, April 28,
2000. The CWC stipulates that states parties should submit their
initial declarations 30 days after entry into force of the
convention for a state party.
</P>
<P>
The CWC, also known as the Convention on the Prohibition of
Development, Production, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons
and their Destruction, was concluded in 1992 after 24 years of U.N.
arms reduction negotiations in Geneva.

<HEADLINE> Manila Says All 21 Hostages Alive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- A ranking official of the Philippine
government said Wednesday that all the 21 hostages held by the
extremist group of Abu Sayyaf in the southern Philippines are
alive.
</P>
<P>
Nur Misuari, chief negotiator of the Philippine government
working for the hostages' release, was quoted by local ABC
television as saying all the hostages are alive although some of
them were injured during a pre-dawn clash between government
troops and Abu Sayyaf members.
</P>
<P>
Misuari, governor of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao,
also said he will continue to do everything in his power to ensure
the hostages' safe release through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Abu Sayyaf commander Galib Andang told the media that
two hostages, a man and a woman, died in gunfire between rebels
and the military early Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 21 hostages, 20 foreigners and one Filipino, were captured
on April 23 from a Malaysian diving resort and brought to Talipao
of Sulu Province in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Government troops seeking the release of the 21 hostages and
Abu Sayyaf rebels clashed several times Tuesday and early
Wednesday near Talipao. At least one soldier was killed and six
injured.

<HEADLINE> India Rules Out Military Intervention in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, May 3 (Xinhua) -- India Wednesday ruled out military
intervention in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to look for peaceful resolution of the conflict in
Sri Lanka," External Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh said after a
meeting of a cabinet committee.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that India will provide humanitarian assistance
to the island nation whenever needed in consultation with the Sri
Lankan government.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet committee met soon after Sri Lankan Foreign
Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar called on Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee amid speculation that Colombo might seek Indian
assistance for evacuating troops trapped in the Jaffna peninsula,
the former stronghold of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (
LITE).
</P>
<P>
The LITE has been fighting for an independent state for the
minority Tamils in the north and east of Sri Lanka.

<HEADLINE> S. Lankan President Rules Out Indian Military Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga Wednesday ruled out the possibility of obtaining
military assistance from India to defend the northern Jaffna
peninsula against Tamil Tiger rebels.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga made her remarks here at a meeting of the ruling
People's Alliance's Parliamentary Group in reaction to a call by
an important group of Buddhist monks, the National Sangha Council,
for Indian troops to assist the government forces to battle rebels
of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
The monks, who are extremely influential in the country where
69 percent of the population is Buddhist, met an envoy from India
last weekend and appealed for military help from New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
The monks' appeal followed a series of stunning military
advances by the LTTE rebels during the past two weeks, who took
control of the key Elephant Pass military base on the northern
Jaffna peninsula on April 22.
</P>
<P>
Eight days later the LTTE rebels consolidated their hold on the
peninsula when they captured another crucial military base at
Pallai.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, who are fighting for a separate Tamil homeland in
Sri Lanka's north and east since 1983, have advanced to within 40
kilometers of the main northern town of Jaffna, their former
stronghold, which they lost to government troops in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The town can now be supplied only by military aircraft and most
analysts believe that its fall is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
"The government should make its first appeal to India. India
may have good reasons to be reluctant to get involved in Sri Lanka.
But Indians cannot remain aloof to what is happening across a few
miles of sea on its southern coast," The Island newspaper here
said in a commentary.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga charged that those who had opposed the
presence of the Indian Army in 1987-1990 are now clamoring for its
return.
</P>
<P>
In 1987, the monks strongly protested when Indian troops were
sent to Sri Lanka to disarm the LTTE rebels under an agreement
with Colombo.
</P>
<P>
The Indian troops withdrew three years later, after the Sri
Lankan government said their stay should end and the episode
remains a humiliating memory for the Indian Army.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga told the meeting that the fall of the Sri Lankan
army base at Elephant Pass last month was a setback, but that her
government is determined to continue the war against the LTTE
rebels.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Factory Orders Leap Ahead in March </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- New orders to U.S. factories
bounced back in March, rising a bigger-than-expected 2.2 percent,
led by the biggest jump in demand for electronic equipment in more
than two years, the Commerce Department reported Wednesday.
</P>

household appliances and communications equipment, posted the

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao sat
in on a number of community youth activities here today, and later
stressed that young people need to grow up in a good environment.
</P>
<P>

Youth League of China (CYLC),
</P>
<P>
The CYLC has designated the area as a national model community

<HEADLINE> Iran Stresses Cooperation with African Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi stated here on Wednesday that Africa enjoys a very special
and outstanding status in Iran's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
"Numerous commonness has linked the Islamic Republic of Iran
with the African countries," Kharrazi told ambassadors and
diplomats from 12 African countries, quoted by the official Islamic
Republic News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the past two decades Iranian government has
tried hard to deepen and upgrade level of ties with African nations
in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Citing safeguarding independence and cultural identity as
evident examples of commonness in mutual contacts, he said that
given the interests and the tremendous economic potentials
available, one can be optimistic about the trend of cooperation.

Kharrazi said that as its policies, the Iranian Foreign Ministry
will make efforts to expand economic and trade cooperation and to
prepare the grounds for further activation of Iranian private

<HEADLINE> Japan Held Responsible for Destruction of Abandoned Chemical Weapons in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Organization for the
Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) Wednesday reaffirmed that
it holds the Japanese government responsible for the destruction
of the chemical weapons the Japanese invading army abandoned in
China during World War II.
</P>
<P>
China has declared that the Japanese army had used and
abandoned large quantities of chemical weapons in Chinese
territory during its invasion of China in World War II and the
Japanese government has admitted the use and abandonment of the
weapons by its army and accepted the responsibility for their
destruction, OPCW Deputy Secretary-General John Gee told a press
conference here.
</P>
<P>
Gee, who is in Singapore attending the Singapore Regional Forum
2000 on implementation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, noted
that as Japan was the abandoning party, the Japanese government
should be held responsible for the destruction of the abandoned
chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
But the first problem is to arrive at a right figure of the
abandoned chemical weapons as Japan declared fewer abandoned
chemical weapons than China, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said both China and Japan have made declarations to the OPCW
and his organization is required to find the accuracy of these
declarations.
</P>
<P>
So far the OPCW has carried out at least nine inspections on
the abandoned chemical weapons in China, he said.
</P>
<P>
The utmost decision on the destruction of the abandoned
chemical weapons is something for the Japanese and Chinese
governments to make, he added.

<HEADLINE> More Children Die of AIDS in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Children who died of AIDS in
Cambodia in the first few months of year 2000 rose to more than 10,
000, Khmer newspaper Rasmei Kampuchea Daily reported Wednesday,
quoting a survey by the National AIDS Authorities.
</P>
<P>
The figure shows a sharp increase in the death rate of children
with AIDS when compared with last year's 9,000.
</P>
<P>
The director of the authorities urged the government to attach
great importance to the issue and take effective measures to
prevent the continuing spread of HIV/AIDS among children.
</P>
<P>
The survey further said a large number of Children were
infected through their parents when they were born while others
were infected as a result of prostitution as a means to earn a
living to feed themselves and their families.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia has the highest number of AIDS victims in Asia with at
least 200,000 known cases. And what is shocking is that up to 100
new AIDS patients are being discovered each day while more than 20
AIDS patients die every day.
</P>
<P>
The Cambodian government has already made this sort of disease
the first priority in public health. The competent authorities, in
close cooperation with all institutions concerned, have taken some
measures to combat the dangerous disease, such as enhancing
education through media and encouraging the use of condoms.

<HEADLINE> Manila Working to Ensure Hostages' Safe Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government reassured
the international community Wednesday that it is working to ensure
the safe release of 21 hostages who were kidnapped by the Abu
Sayyaf group from an island resort in Malaysia and later taken to
Sulu.
</P>
<P>
Press Secretary Ricardo Puno said the Philippines is closely
coordinating with governments representing the foreign hostages in
providing them with information about the latest series of actions
being taken to ensure their safe release.
</P>
<P>
"We've asked them to please give us the opportunity to handle
the problem. If needed, we will get their advice and we will get
whatever assistance they can give us. But the ball is with us at
this time,"Puno said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
Puno said the government has received "expressions of support"
from some foreign governments whose nationals were abducted on
April 23 from an island resort in Sabah and taken to Jolo in Sulu
Province. The military has cordoned off the area where the
hostages are being held.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the government is doing everything to
negotiate with the kidnappers for the safe release of the hostages
at the earliest possible time.
</P>
<P>
Puno also made it clear that the government has no plans to
replace Governor Nur Misuari of the Autonomous Region in Muslim
Mindanao as one of the government negotiators tasked to secure the
hostages' safe release.
</P>
<P>
Unconfirmed reports said two foreign hostages, a man and a
woman, held by the Abu Sayyaf in Sulu died when they were
reportedly caught in the crossfire between soldiers and the
terrorist group before dawn Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Armed Forces Chief of Staff Angelo Reyes announced
that 13 of the 27 hostages held by the Abu Sayyaf were rescued
Wednesday by government troops in Basilan Province where they have
been held since March 20.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Philippine Vice President Gloria
Macapagal Arroyo said the Abu Sayyaf has sent formal messages on
its plans to release minor hostages on condition that they could
be able to meet her in Basilan Province.
</P>
<P>
But Puno said Arroyo has not been authorized to negotiate with
the Abu Sayyaf for the release of children taken hostage by the
extremist group.

<HEADLINE> China to Mark Centennial Discovery of Dunhuang Caves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, May 3 (Xinhua) -- China plans to commemorate the 100th
anniversary of the discovery of a sealed chamber full of Buddhist
scriptures and treasures in rock grottoes in the northwest
province of Gansu.
</P>
<P>
Starting from June 22, 100 years to the day when a Taoist
priest accidentally came across the chamber in the Dunhuang Mogao
Grottoes, a series of exhibitions, symposiums and performances
based on Dunhuang art will be staged both in the Chinese capital
and Dunhuang.
</P>
<P>
The caves, carved out of the rocks, stretch about 1,600 meters
along the eastern side of Mingsha Hill, 25 km southeast of the
town of Dunhuang in the northwest desert corridor of Gansu.
</P>
<P>
The province was once an important caravan stop on the Silk
Road linking Central Asia with China.
</P>
<P>
In spite of protracted natural erosion and man-made destruction,
492 caves formed over the course of a thousand years are still
intact, featuring frescoes covering an area of 45,000 square
meters, more than 2,000 colored sculptured figures, and five
wooden eaves hanging over the caves.
</P>
<P>
Many precious scriptures, historical documents, paintings, and
relics contained in the secret chamber were later taken abroad by
foreign adventurers, stunning the world in the early 1900s.
</P>
<P>
A gathering to mark the centennial discovery will be held at
the Great Hall of the People in Beijing in early July. Senior
Chinese officials will participate.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Culture, the Gansu provincial government and
the State Administration of Cultural Heritage will also organize
celebrations in July, including an exhibition of copies of
Dunhuang relics, an international academic symposium for more than
200 scholars from abroad, and regular tours to the grottoes.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Railway Remains Backbone of HK Transport System (1)  by Li Nuer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 3 (Xinhua) -- In light of the merits from the
transport perspective and the positive sentiments on all fronts,
railways' strategic role as the backbone of the transport system
in Hong Kong will no doubt continue, a senior Hong Kong transport
official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"It is obvious that in the years to come, our railway
development program will create substantial opportunities for the
managerial, professional and technical levels in the years ahead,"
Secretary for Transport Nicholas Ng said at the opening of the 5th
International Exhibition of Railway Technology for the Asian
Markets Exporail (Asia) 2000.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe that international and local companies in the
private sector will have ample opportunities to participate in the
design and implementation of these railway projects in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
With a massive rail development program involving six projects
and costing over 100 billion HK dollars (12.8 billion U.S. dollars)
under active planning and implementation and planning for
completion between 2002 and 2005, Hong Kong is indeed a perfect
place for cross-fertilization of rail technology and investment
opportunities to take place.
</P>
<P>
The strong attendance of distinguished community leaders,
professionals, academics and industry organizations at the
exhibition may underline the importance of railway development in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the government's policy on railways, Ng said, "Our
aim is to provide a safe, efficient, reliable and environmentally
friendly transport system which meets the economic, social and
recreational needs of our community."
</P>
<P>
Since the 1970s, Hong Kong has completed a railway network of
about 143 kilometers and some 55 percent of the total population
are now within walking distance of railway stations, statistics
show.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Railway Remains Backbone of HK Transport System (2)  By Li Nuer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Currently, Hong Kong's railway network carries about 3.5
million passenger trips every day and accounts for more than 30
percent of the total public transport patronage.
</P>
<P>
"Following the first comprehensive Railway Development Strategy
we published in 1994, we are now actively planning and
implementing six new railways for completion between 2002 and 2005,
" Ng said.
</P>
<P>
Their total investment exceeds more than 110 billion HK dollars
(14.1 billion U.S. dollars) and completion of these railways by
2005 will be a milestone for Hong Kong's public transport system
and development, he said.
</P>
<P>
The network will expand by more than 40 percent to more than
200 kilometers and its catchment will cover more than 70 percent
of the total population. Accordingly, the rail share in public
transport patronage is estimated to increase to about 38 percent.
</P>
<P>
At that time, the new towns in the eastern and northwestern
parts of Hong Kong will all have rail connections to the urban
areas.
</P>
<P>
In order to support the growing population and the economy in
an environmentally acceptable manner, the government has
commissioned a consultancy study to look at the next phase of
railway development for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The Second Railway Development Study, which started in March
1998, is studying the next phase of railway projects which Hong
Kong needs between 2006 and 2016.
</P>
<P>
This phase of railway projects aims to serve the new growth
areas and meet the increase in transport demands due to increased
linkage with the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The next era of railway development will expand the present
network by 70 percent to some 250 kilometers. More than 80 percent
of the total population will then fall within the rail catchment
and the rail share will reach some 45 percent of the public
transport system which accounts for 85 percent of the total trips.

<HEADLINE> Israeli-Palestinian Team to Compete in Jeep Rally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 3 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli-Palestinian joint team
is to leave for Paris on Thursday morning to participate in an off-
road jeep rally from there to Fez, Morocco.
</P>
<P>
Naomi Ackerman and Ikhsan Turkiya, both being actresses and
amateur rally players, are from Israel and the Palestinian self-
rule area respectively, an Israeli Foreign Ministry statement said
on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The joint sport team is part of "People to People" (PTP)
projects between the two sides, which had been foes for decades and
are currently trying to resolve their differences through the
channel of peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The two, who will act as driver and navigator respectively, have
to cooperate closely as any misunderstanding and non-confidence
between them will surely harm their chance to win the trophy.
</P>
<P>
That, according to the statement, will enhance the spirit of
cooperation between them, which in turn are expectedly extended to
other areas.
</P>
<P>
The two young women, who had been in the PTP cooperation for
four years, have a good personal relationship. Their participation
in the rally will surely draw international media attention.
</P>
<P>
The annual Jeep race, which is for women only, will take off
from the Eiffel Tower in Paris on Friday and end in Morocco on May
20, with a considerable part of the route winding through the
Sahara desert.
</P>
<P>
Israeli mission in Rabat, the capital city of Morocco, will keep
in close contact with the team as they were selected by the
mission, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Ross: U.S. to Advance Israeli-Palestinian Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The United States will boost its
efforts to help push the Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks
forward so that the two sides could clinch a peace deal as soon as
possible, said a senior U.S. official in Israel's southern resort
city of Eilat Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Dennis Ross, U.S. special Middle East peace envoy, told
reporters after meeting with leaders of the Israeli and Palestinian
negotiating teams that Israel and Palestinians intend to make a
major effort in the next two months to reach a framework accord
leading to a final peace deal, according to Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Israeli chief negotiator Oded Eran and his Palestinian
counterpart Yasser Abed Rabbo are leading their respective
negotiating teams to the final-status talks, which started at Eilat
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Ross, who arrived in Eilat Tuesday evening to monitor the talks,
said the two sides had reached a "new and intensive phase" in their
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"It's a difficult process but there is also a very serious
effort being made and the intentions on each side, I think, are
very clear and, I would say, genuine, and the purpose is to reach
agreement," Ross said.
</P>
<P>
Israel and the Palestinians have already missed a February
deadline for a framework agreement, and Israel has suggested the
two sides reach that agreement in mid-May. A final peace agreement
on final-status is due by September 13.
</P>
<P>
The final-status talks cover the thorniest issues such as the
fate of Jerusalem, Jewish settlements, Palestinian refugees,
borders and water.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have since last
September been trying to tackle all these issues, but no
substantial progress has been made despite two rounds of intensive
talks between the two sides in the U.S. with U.S. involvement.
</P>
<P>
"At a certain point I would expect the (U.S.) Secretary of
States (Madeleine Albright) to come out here and at a certain point
she would made a judgement as to when it would be appropriate to
bring the leaders together with the U.S. President (Bill Clinton),"
Ross added.
</P>
<P>
He said he would travel from Eilat to Jerusalem on Thursday to
meet Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
The current round of talks will last till May 12.

said Wednesday that it sees no reason to declare a state of
emergency in Mindanao despite some isolated violence that has
erupted in some areas.
</P>

Press Secretary Ricardo Puno said President Joseph Estrada has
junked suggestions to declare a state of emergency in the south,

performance of the military in its response to terroristic
incidents in Mindanao.

IFFC head Catholic priest Eliseo Mercado said there are an
estimated 10,000 individuals trapped in crossfire between the
government and the MILF at disputed zones in the two provinces.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia to Attract More Chinese Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SIEM REAP, Cambodia, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese visitors will be
allowed to use the yuan, the Chinese currency, at Cambodia's
tourist sites,Prime Minister Hun Sen announced here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a two-day tourism conference held here Tuesday and
Wednesday, Hun Sen said, "I support the proposal put forward by
the Tourism Ministry that allows Chinese visitors to use the
Chinese yuan at tourist sites, but it needs the permission of the
Chinese government." "This will help attract more Chinese visitors
to Cambodia," he added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that though the level of consumption of Chinese
tourists is less than other foreign visitors, China has a huge
tourism market and has great potentials with a population of more
than 1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
About 30,000 visitors came to Cambodia from China's mainland
last year and tourism officials are hoping that the number will
more than triple to 100,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the prime minister said Cambodia now has entered a
golden age of tourism development due to the achievement of
complete peace in the country, but he emphasized that "if there is
no security for the visitors, we can not attract more foreign
tourists to Cambodia."
</P>
<P>
Cambodia is targeting neighbors its in Asia. Tourist arrivals
increased 33 percent last year and should rise further this year
by Hun Sen's "open skies" policy that allows direct international
flights to Siem Reap.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen also urged the authorities concerned to make efforts to
protect the historic sites and tourist attractions and improve the
infrastructure and service industries as well as tourist personnel
training.

HARARE, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Ministers from five Southern African
Development Community (SADC) countries involved in the development
of the Okavango-Upper Zambezi Tourist Initiative will meet on the
implementation of the project.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the on-going Zimbabwe International Trade Fair on
Wednesday in Bulawayo, an official with Zimbabwean Ministry of
Industry and Commerce Norman Chakanetsa said that Angola,
Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe would soon map out the
project.
</P>
<P>
The project, which would see the Victoria Falls as the
epicenter of the whole program, would be one of the countries' key
investment strategies that would boost the tourism industry as a
major foreign currency earner for them, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe would propose that each country appoint a
national committee which would be led by a project manager.
</P>
<P>
"The regional committee will then develop terms of reference
for the consultants who will carry out feasibility studies in all
the countries involved," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Okavango tourism project is an ambitious plan aimed at
creating an international tourism attraction area to the
north-west of Bulawayo that would incorporate game parks in the
five SADC countries.
</P>
<P>
The proposed development zone would cover an area of 260,000
square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
It would incorporate international tourist assets such as
Livingstone in Zambia, Zimbabwe's Hwange National Park, the
Caprivi Game Reserve in Namibia, the Northern Okavango in Botswana
and the Mucusso and Luena National Parks in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The governments' contribution to the project would be through
the upgrading of infrastructure such as roads, bridges and
airports while the private sector would invest in hotels and
related facilities.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- E-business is now a big challenge to
Nigeria for the country needs to reinvent the wheel to align with
global economy, said Orji Alala, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of
a Nigerian Internet Service Provider on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the annual "Computer, Telecommunications
and Office Equipment Exhibition" currently holding here under the
theme of "e- Business: Laying the Foundation of a Digital
Economy."
</P>
<P>
About 110 companies are participating the exhibition, including
some of the big names in the world information technology (IT)
industry, showing an increasing outsider enthusiasm upon the
growing IT market in the most populous African country.
</P>
<P>
However, the country's outdated communications systems hiccuped
the growth, when most of the common families in the country still
 have no access to a telephone.
</P>
<P>
According to Ernest Ndukwe, Chief executive of the Nigerian
Communications Commission (NCC), the government body overseeing
the industry, the NCC "is committed to improving the network by
creating an environment where services will not be a problem to
anybody."
</P>
<P>
President Olusegun Obasanjo purged the leadership of the
National Telecommunication Corporation last month in a bid to
facilitate its reform and privatization.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria may lag behind in global electronic business
(e-business) unless the necessary infrastructure is put in place,
commented the United States Ambassador to Nigeria William
Twaddell during his visit to the show on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Nigeria should take advantage of its current climate for
reforms to lay a solid foundation for a digital economy to be led
by the private sector," the ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
According to Twaddell, "In 1999 global e-commerce was valued at
about 150 billion U.S. dollars and is estimated to exceed 300
billion dollars by the end of 2002."
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, which began on Tuesday, will end on Friday.

<HEADLINE> China Can Achieve Sustained Capital Inflows after WTO Entry, Report Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 3 (Xinhua) -- China is able to achieve
sustainable capital inflows particularly with the gradual
liberalization of many services sectors after its WTO entry,
according to the latest Hang Seng Economic Monthly issue.
</P>
<P>
The magazine, published by Hang Seng Bank, carried a report
entitled "Maintaining China's External Balance", saying as long as
the domestic environment remains conducive to foreign investors,
the untapped spending power of China's 1.25 billion population
would continue to attract foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that the mainland witnessed significant growth
in balance of payment between 1990 and 1999, with the surpluses
coming mainly from capital inflows in the form of foreign direct
investment.
</P>
<P>
Approximately 90 percent of the country's cumulative inward
foreign direct investment of 300 billion U.S. dollars in the past
two decades was made between 1993 and 1999, the report said.
</P>
<P>
China's current account surpluses were also recorded in nine of
the 10 years from 1990 to 1999, and exports grew at a compound
rate of 14 percent annually, reaching 195 billion U.S. dollars in
1999, making China the world's ninth largest trading entity, it
said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the huge and recurring balance of payments
surpluses not only lift the country's foreign exchange reserves
from 5.6 billion U.S. dollars in 1989 to the world's second
largest of 155 billion U.S. dollars in 1999, but also helped
preserve the stability of its currency and financial system during
the Asian financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
China's immense domestic market will offer huge potential to
foreign investors, though managing its external capital flows
could be a greater challenge as it looks forward to deepening its
integration with the world by becoming a WTO member.

<HEADLINE> Sale of Looted Chinese Relics Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 3 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Hong Kong SAR
official said the statement by Sotheby's and Christie's to sell
two looted Chinese relics in Hong Kong was a "commercial activity
that couldn't be more stupid."
</P>
<P>
Leung Chun-ying, convenor of the executive council here Tuesday,
"I believe the auction deeply hurt the feelings of Hong Kong and
Chinese people," Leung added.
</P>
<P>
Leung said the antiques were not "ordinary national treasures,"
but relics looted during invasions by foreign forces in the most
humiliating period in Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
Leung said he didn't think even from a commercial point of view
the sales would do any of these commercial concerns any good.
</P>
<P>
Clashes occurred between protesters and police outside the
auction venue. The protesters demanded the auction be stopped and
the treasures returned to the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
Business groups from Beijing spent more than 52 million HK
dollars (about 6.66 million US dollars) on Sunday and Tuesday to
buy four looted art treasures - a hexagonal vase from the Qian
Long Reign of the Qing Dynasty and bronze heads of a tiger, an ox
and a monkey.

<P>
The decision was announced on May 1 in Washington, when U.S.
Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky presented the results of
the 2000 Special 301 annual review.
</P>
<P>
The section concerning Macao noted that over the past months
Macao has made reasonable progress in attacking piracy problems
that led to its placement on the Special 301 Priority Watch List.
</P>
<P>
"Although only a few months have passed since the establishment
of the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR), relations have
improved with American copyright associations, especially with the
Motion Picture Association, with whom Macao has conducted five
joint enforcement operations so far this year," the annual review
said.
</P>
<P>
It also mentioned that Macao's courts have implemented a
special expedited prosecution system that allows a suspect to be
brought immediately to trial. "In view of the significant momentum
that Macao has demonstrated to improve intellectual property
protections, Macao is being lowered from Priority Watch List to
Watch List status."
</P>
<P>
However, the United States will conduct an out-of-cycle review
of Macao in December 2000, according to the review.

<HEADLINE> Barak Convenes Cabinet on Economy, Not Abu Dis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
held a cabinet meeting on Wednesday morning to discuss Israel's
economic policies, without mentioning the transfer of three Arab
villages near Jerusalem to Palestinian control as originally
expected.
</P>
<P>
The major task of Wednesday's meeting was to talk over changes
in national economic priorities and economic plans, a statement
issued by Prime Minister's Office said.
</P>
<P>
Notably, the handover of the Jerusalem neighborhoods as "an
advance" prior to further Israeli troops withdrawal from the West
Bank and Gaza Strip appeared not on the schedule, showing Barak
again caved in to pressure from rightist parities.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the week, Barak's confidants expressed expectations
that Wednesday's cabinet meeting would approve the transfer of Abu
Dis, Azariya, and Swahara, which are currently under Israeli
security and Palestinian civilian control, to Palestinian full
control.
</P>
<P>
Barak reportedly hoped the proposed handover would act as a
confidence building measure to the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian
talks in Israel's Red Sea resort of Eilat, aiming to reach a
framework agreement on the final-status issues, including the fate
of Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, Jewish settlements, borders,
water and security.
</P>
<P>
However, as he could not garner enough support from Israel's
rightist parties in the cabinet or the Knesset (parliament), with
two of his junior ruling coalition partners even threatening to
quit, Barak retreated from his earlier position on the issue.
</P>
<P>
To change the focus, Barak Wednesday told his ministers that
Israel is at a very important crossroads regarding economic
development, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
Barak, urged by public to pay more attention to the country's
economic development than the peace process, insisted that Israel's
prudent monetary policies, a responsible wage policy and a
considered budget are contributing to positive economic
developments, whose first fruits can already be seen.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that expected growth for the year 2000 is 3.5
percent to 4 percent, higher than that of the past few years, while
imports of production inputs and investment goods, exports and
tourism earnings are growing.
</P>
<P>
He cited the stabilization of unemployment as one of his major
economic achievements, saying the trend of continuously rising
unemployment rate will be reversed and 60,000 new jobs were created
in the past year.
</P>
<P>
He talked proudly about rising foreign investment for
development in Galilee in the north and Negev in the south, which
are traditionally developing areas in the developed Middle East
country.
</P>
<P>
For example, he said, Japan's Toshiba group is considering
investing 1.4 billion U.S. dollars to establish a plant, and
computer chip magnate Intel recently announced it's examining a 3
billion dollars investment in there areas.
</P>
<P>
He also promised that although most effect of these developments
will only be seen in several months, the government has been ready
to fulfill its commitments to ease the distress that still exists
in Israeli society, and to provide aid to those who need it in the
immediate term.
</P>
<P>
Later, the cabinet listened to a National Blueprint Plan about
how the country's economy and infrastructure should look in 20
years' time, which was prepared by prominent economic experts in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet Secretary Yitzhak Herzog said this report was in line
with the prime minister's intention to plan state budgets
rationally and to eliminate wide social gaps.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet is also scheduled to discuss the details of the Ben-
Bassat Committee recommendations for sweeping tax reform, which are
to be made public Thursday morning and reportedly suggest levying
taxes on real profits from capital markets, saving plans, pension
funds, and apartment sales and rentals.

<HEADLINE> 9 Children Hostages Rescued by Philippine Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Defense Secretary Orlando
Mercado announced Wednesday the rescue of nine of the 27 hostages
held by the Abu Sayyaf in Basilan, but could not confirm reports
of the death of two foreign hostages in nearby Sulu island.
</P>
<P>
There are 18 hostages still in the hands of the Abu Sayyaf, he
told a press conference here.
</P>
<P>
Mercado said that the hostages were rescued by pursuing
government troops in a encounter with the fleeing terrorist group
in Lantawan, some 15 kilometers from Mt. Mohadje in Sumisip, where
the hostages were held by the Abu Sayyaf for more than six weeks.
</P>
<P>
The rescue was also an indication that the Muslim extremists
had escaped from a military dragnet on Mt. Mohadje, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I'd like to inform you that our men in the field have just
reported to us that our operation in Lantawan, Basilan have
resulted in the recovery of nine of the children who have been
kidnapped on March 20," Mercado said at a press conference in Camp
Aguinaldo.
</P>
<P>
He was confident the remaining hostages will be rescued
Wednesday or Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mercado said the rescued children were not mentioned in the
report sent by Maj. Gen. Diomedio Villanueva, commander of the AFP
Southern Command (Southcom) in Zamboanga City.
</P>
<P>
"We still do not have the names. We don't have the complete
circumstances," he said.
</P>
<P>
The rescue of hostages was "a result of the efforts, the
operations of our military," he added.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Mercado would not confirm reports
that two foreign hostages, a man and a woman, held by Abu Sayyaf
in Talipao, Sulu died when they were reportedly caught in the
cross-fire between soldiers and the terrorist group before dawn
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"There is no confirmation as regards the report that there are
people who were killed this morning," Mercado said.
</P>
<P>
"Our troops went to the area, checked the house where they were
held for sometime. We know that they have been moved out in a
residence about a kilometer away westward of the area where they
were held," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the troops found no bodies in the area.
</P>
<P>
The defense chief rejected a demand by the Abu Sayyaf for the
withdrawal of government troops surrounding the area where
hostages were kept.
</P>
<P>
"The cordon that has been put around the area where the
hostages are and the area where the kidnappers are, will remain,"
he said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Situation Negatively Affects Trade Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 3 (Xinhua) -- South African companies have
withdrawn from this year's Zimbabwe International Trade Fair due
to the negative publicity Zimbabwe is receiving in the neighboring
country.
</P>
<P>
Henning Visser, spokesman for Montana International Trading
Company, which coordinates the participation of South African
companies at the fair, told the Zimbabwe News Agency Wednesday
that only one company is exhibiting.
</P>
<P>
"A number of companies cancelled their visit to the fair at the
last minute because Zimbabwe is receiving very negative publicity
in the country, " he said.
</P>
<P>
This is the single most painful blow to the fair's organizers
and the government as South African companies had led the numbers
and even the quality of exhibits at the annual fair since
democracy came to that country in 1994.
</P>
<P>
For the past two years, the South Africans had been occupying
an entire hall, the size of a half football pitch and after last
year's fair, exhibitors from Zimbabwe's largest trading partner
had promised to come back en masse.
</P>
<P>
More unfortunate is that this year South African companies were
supposed to still the show, what with their president Thabo Mbeki
officially opening the showcase on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"I told them that their country's president is going to open
the fair, but this did not make a difference as they were not keen
to participate," said Visser.
</P>
<P>
British and Scottish companies are also for the fourth year
running not taking part in the fair, despite being Zimbabwe's key
trading partners.
</P>
<P>
The British are fighting the Zimbabwean government over its
land policies and until this is resolved, they vowed to
marginalize it economically.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Council of State Mediates Executive, Legislature Feud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Council of State, consisting
of former heads of state and governors, Tuesday brokered a truce
in the stand- off between Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo and
the National Assembly, The Guardian reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ebonyi State Governor Sam Egwu, who attended a meeting of the
council, was quoted by the leading Nigerian newspaper as saying
that "there will be no more removal of anybody, I can assure you
all is well now in the Senate and the National Assembly in
general."
</P>
<P>
Former heads of state Shehu Shagari, Yakubu Gowon, Mohammadu
Buhari, Ibrahim Babangida, Ernest Shonekan and Abdulsalami
Abubakar, called for an immediate resolution of the crisis in the
nation's interest during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The row between the top executive and legislature of the West
African country over 2000 budget and proposed impeachment of the
state president or senate president had severely impeded the
normal functioning of the federal government.
</P>
<P>
There is need to avert frequent squabbles between both arms of
government, Shagari said, explaining that such political crisis is
inevitable but understanding and maturity are needed to surmount
such obstacles.
</P>
<P>
He noted that during the second republic, although his ruling
National Party of Nigeria was in minority, he was still able to
manage the relationship between both arms with maturity and
without much rancour.
</P>
<P>
Shagari appealed for mutual relationship in the interest of the
nation and democracy, saying that it was necessary to preserve the
nation's nascent democracy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Alhaji Isiyaku Ibrahim, political chieftain of the
People's Democratic Party, called for mutual respect between the
Presidency and the National Assembly and the principle of
separation of powers.
</P>
<P>
He urged President Obasanjo to tolerate the National Assembly
in view of the fact that it is the least developed of the three
arms of government because of the effects of military rule.
</P>
<P>
According to Oyo State Governor Lam Adesina, although the issue
has been resolved, there is an urgent need for dialogue between
the legislature and the executive.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Cuban government is to assist
Ghana in establishing a medical networking project, reported the
Ghana News Agency on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The proposed tele-medicine would help medical officers in Ghana
to make use of modern telecommunication equipment and software in
offering services in diagnosis, therapies and improve the overall
health care in the country, Daniel Fernadez Lopez, head of a
four-member Cuban delegation currently on a visit to Ghana, was
quoted as saying in the capital Accra on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Ghanaian Minister of Health Kwaku
Danso-Boafo, Lopez said the program, which covers pathology and
radiology among others, would benefit especially medical officers
and patients in remote areas of the country since the cost of
transportation and movement would be reduced.
</P>
<P>
When the project takes off, medical officers would be able to
have access to modern medical information, he said, adding that
those in remote areas could even seek advice from their colleagues
elsewhere on how to effectively manage difficult cases through
networking.
</P>
<P>
On his side, Danso-Boafo said the cooperation between the two
countries in the area of health would help improve the standard of
health-care in Ghana.
</P>
<P>
There are about 72 Cuban doctors currently working in the west

the council in September 1993, although the full details on the
trigger prices and enforcement mechanisms will be polished up at
the London meeting, said UCDA board secretary William Naggaga.
</P>
<P>
"This meeting is critical to efforts by producing countries in
halting the downward slide in prices," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Retention" means holding back some of the total coffee output
in order to cause an artificial shortage of the commodity on the
world market.
</P>
<P>
Despite low prices, coffee remains Uganda's leading foreign
exchange earner. During the 1998-1999 financial year, the
country's coffee exports totalled 214,060 tons worth 302.6 million
U.S. dollars, contributing about 60 percent of foreign earnings.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- French Minister of Economy, Finance
and Industry Laurent Fabius said on Wednesday that the euro keeps
falling because the political unity of the 11 euro zone countries
is not solid enough.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the weekly Le Nouvel Observateur published
on Wednesday, Fabius said Europe has a strong economic potential
which should also be reflected in its money.
</P>
<P>
"We still don't know how to explain it sufficiently, and above
all, the political unity of the 11 euro countries is not solid
enough yet," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the meeting of finance ministers of the
seven most industrialized nations and the International Monetary
Fund last month in Washington, most attendants agreed that the
euro was under-valued by 30 percent in its exchange rate with the
U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The euro fell below 0.90 U.S. dollar on Wednesday, the record
low since its launching in January 1999.

<HEADLINE> E-Commerce Brings Tourism New Opportunities (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 3 (Xinhua) -- E-commerce, which takes the world
by storm in recent years, is bringing new business opportunities
to global travel and tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
"New technology, e-commerce, space travel -- all of these are
taking shape around us. Nearly every day, we hear about business
opportunities and solutions that we wouldn't have dreamed of even
a year ago," said J. Daniel Burruss, chairman of the Pacific Asia
Travel Association (PATA), at the 49th PATA Annual Conference to
close Wednesday in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
A survey from Media Metrix, a U.S. leader in the Internet and
digital media measurement, shows that some 14 million people used
the Internet in 1999 to book 7 billion U.S. dollars in travel, and
the number of people booking travel is expected to rise to 75
million by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
With the rising of the Internet boom, the tourist sector would
by no means be left behind. Tourism-related institutions and
Internet companies are joining hands in tap this potential market.
</P>
<P>
PATA, a recognized authority on Pacific Asia travel and tourism,
is committed to develop e-commerce. Just prior to its 49th Annual
Conference, PATA signed a memorandum of understanding with 11th
Hour Deals.com, which offers last-minute travel specials to
businesses and consumers.
</P>
<P>
Through the 11th Hour Deals channel, PATA members are able to
distribute a large number of their products to other businesses as
well as to consumers. Travelers, as a result, will be able to pick
up specially discounted, value-for-money travel bargains and deals.
The 11th Hour channel is ideal for the busy executive who is only
able to decide at the last minute on their business or leisure
travel.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, PATA has become an affiliate of Amazon.com. Pacific
Asia travel guides and related books are listed on PATA net, and
all other Amazon.com products can also be accessed via PATA site.
</P>
<P>
A WTO report says that people who expect global communication
and access to instant information also have the same demands for
tourism and travel data, and that they will soon want to obtain
this information from their own living room and even their mobile
phone.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the Interactive digital television (IDTV) and
wireless application protocol (WAP) technology, their demands are
able to become reality.

The Americans are by far the biggest group of online buyers. U.
S.-based Forrester Research reveals that 38.5 percent of e-
transactions in the country are for travel, transport and hotel
reservations.
</P>
<P>
In France, half of the most commonly visited suppliers on the
Internet are in the travel and transport sector, according to a
French newspaper Journal du net.
</P>
<P>
Airlines and hotels and many other industry sectors have made
enormous investment in improving service and establishing customer
loyalty and retention programs.
</P>
<P>
"For airlines, the Internet is another service enhancement,"
said Jonathan Kiehnau, managing director of Emphasis Custom Media
(ECM), a subsidiary of Time Warner. "The best airlines will use
the Internet to maximize the inflight experience by improving
customer service and providing information whenever people need it.
"
</P>
<P>
A report of Airline Business says that about 1.5 billion
passengers flew in 1999, and more and more of them are traveling
with computers. "It is clear that there is tremendous opportunity
to target customers for every travel industry segment," said
Kiehnau.
</P>
<P>
"The inflight Internet will an adjunct and complement to
traditional diversions such as magazines, movies, newspapers and
music. It will replace it," he noted.
</P>
<P>
During the flight, the aircraft will communicate through
satellites to a terrestrial base. At regular intervals it will
exchange e-mails and other information, like weather, sports and
news.
</P>
<P>
He said a passenger can open his computer and log on inflight,
and then collect his own e-mails. The passenger can follow the
airline's links to valuable information to help improve this and
future trips.
</P>
<P>
"The passenger may be able to order duty free goods by the
clicks of a mouse and have his purchases waiting for him at his
arrival gate or delivered to his hotel. He might visit a site
sponsored by a hotel in his destination city and look for
information about recreational activities," Kiehnau explained. (

<HEADLINE> HK Universities Achieve Remarkable Research Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 3 (Xinhua) -- All higher education institutions
in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region have continued to
achieve remarkable improvement in their research performance since
1996, with many research results reaching international standards,
said the HKSAR University Grants Committee (UGC) here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the results of the UGC's 1999 Research Assessment
Exercise (RAE), Alice Lam, chairman of the UGC, explained: "All
UGC funded institutions, the seven local universities and the Hong
Kong Institute of Education, are obliged to submit their research
outputs to the UGC for assessment in the RAE."
</P>
<P>
This exercise is conducted over a three-year cycle and the
results are factored into the UGC's assessment of the institutions
' recurrent grants.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, more than 4,200 eligible staff in the eight UGC-funded
institutions submitted research output items for review and over
18,000 items were assessed, representing an increase of roughly 30
percent over 1996.
</P>
<P>
Lam said: "over 70 percent of the eligible academic staff in
the UGC-funded institutions were able to produce some output that
were of a quality which the panels considered worthwhile, and over
55 percent (including fractional counts) have been assessed to
have met the threshold standard of excellence appropriate to the
discipline in Hong Kong, and showing some evidence of
international excellence."
</P>
<P>
In the current triennium (1998-2001), the UGC allocated a total
of 12,017 million Hong Kong dollars (about 1,540.6 million U.S.
dollars) to institutions for research.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Court uphold Death Sentence on Iraqi Puppet Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, May 3 (Xinhua) -- A Kuwaiti court Wednesday upheld
the death sentence against the leader of Iraq's puppet government
in Kuwait installed during its invasion of the country in 1990, the
official KUNA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
KUNA said the Kuwait Criminal Court rejected an appeal by
defendant Alaa Hussein, who was sentenced to death in absentia in
1993 for treason and cooperation with Baghdad during its seven-
month occupation of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Hussein, 41, was apparently shocked after hearing the verdict as
he claimed that the Kuwaiti government had promised to pardon him
before he returned home from exile in Norway in January, but
Kuwaiti Information Minister Saad bin Tiflah denied the claim.
</P>
<P>
Hussein, a former Kuwaiti colonel, argued that he was forced to
lead the puppet government handpicked by Iraqi president Saddam
Hussein after the occupation of Kuwait. His government lasted only
about a week after the invasion. Saddam later annexed Kuwait and
declared it an Iraqi governorate before the Iraqi forces were
defeated in the following Gulf war.

CAIRO, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will take part in the Art and

<P>
The Ministry of Culture and Information of Djibouti has invited

Somalia has been in division and factional conflicts since 1991
when its former president, Siad Barre, was toppled.
</P>
<P>
Hosni underlined that Egypt's participation in the festival
emanates from its keenness on helping bring about peace in Somalia
and the African continent, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The festival coincides with a conference on peace in Somalia,
also to be convened in Djibouti, which will discuss a peace plan
proposed by Djibouti last year to put an end to Somalia's division
and forge national reconciliation, according to the minister.

<P>
KAMPALA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- A virus closely related to the one
that causes AIDS has been detected among 80 percent of the lions
sampled in Uganda's Queen Elizabeth National Park, the New Vision
daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The bug, named Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV), made lions
succumb to diseases such as tuberculosis, said Lugwig Sieferta,
wildlife health lecturer at the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine,
Makerere University.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted as saying that the lions still looked healthy but
were at a high risk of falling sick, and the symptoms include
progressive wasting and recurrent fevers.
</P>
<P>
"We know that FIV can lower the immunity. It is like AIDS. We
are monitoring them (lions). If there is an outbreak, we know what
to do," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said tuberculosis has been detected in prey animals like
buffaloes and warthogs, posing a threat to lions that are under
FIV stress.
</P>
<P>
Lions can contract tuberculosis by eating infected prey
animals, he said.

<HEADLINE> Norwegians Go on Strike for Payment Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Norway was hit Wednesday by the
biggest strike since 1986 with 85,000 workers going on to the
streets to ask for higher pay.
</P>
<P>
The strike, which was organized by the Norwegian Confederation
of Trade Unions (NCTU), disrupted almost everything from hotels to
ferries.
</P>
<P>
The strike is expected to last one week as there has been no
sign of consensus between the workers and their bosses so far. It
will also bring an indirect economic loss of 900 million Norwegian
Krone (about 110 million U.S. dollars) and seriously affect the
country's export.
</P>
<P>
The NCTU decided to hold the strike on May 3 after most of the
workers refused to accept the agreement reached between the NCTU
and the Confederation of Norwegian Business and Industry.

<HEADLINE> Iran Starts Third Court Hearing on Jews Charged of Espionage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran's revolutionary court on
Wednesday started the third closed-door court hearing on 13 Iranian
Jews accused of spying for Israel in the southern city of Shiraz,
the state-run television reported.
</P>
<P>
Iranian judicial officials said that information would be
released after the courting hearing which started at 09:00 hours
local times (0430 GMT) under the judge Sadeq Nourani.
</P>
<P>
The 13 Jews were charged of espionage, acts endangering the
national security, cooperation with the Israeli intelligence
service Mossad and furnishing information to a foreign country
resulting in damage to the state.
</P>
<P>
Hamid Tefilin, one of the Jews on Monday night confessed that he
had spied for Israel and betrayed his country after the 2nd court
hearing. "I am guilty. I accept the charges against me. I spied for
Israel," he said in an interview with the television.
</P>
<P>
Israel has denied that the Iranian Jews were spying for the
Jewish state, which Iran fiercely opposes, and condemned the
confession as "coerced."
</P>
<P>
"The accusations against them are cruel lies, once again we are
in a situation where Jews are imprisoned just because they are
Jews,'' Israel's Diaspora Affairs Minister Michael Melchior said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, defense lawyer said that under the Iranian laws and
international norms, a confession by a person who has spent a year
or more in prison has no value.
</P>
<P>
Iranian judicial officials have promised a fair and impartial
trial for the 13 Jews who were arrested in March and April last
year with eight Muslims in Shiraz, Fars province, the center of
Iran's 35,000-strong Jewish community.
</P>
<P>
The west expressed grave concern on the trial after the U.S. and
Israel denied any link between their intelligence services and the
Iranian Jews. But Tehran has rejected any "foreign interference" in
the trial.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Mayor Sacked by City Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The mayor of a small Iranian city has
been dismissed by the city council that oversees behavior of the
administrative staff, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This is the first case that a mayor has been sacked by the city
council since the country held its first local elections in
February, 1999 to elect councils for 720 cities, towns and
villages.
</P>
<P>
Mehdi Askari, mayor of Garmsar of the northern Semnan Province,
has been sacked following a city council impeachment session, said
the city's council spokesman Mohammad Shadlou.
</P>
<P>
He was ousted on the basis of article 23 of the city council for
ignoring approved resolutions of the Islamic council that warranted
administrative discipline, taking unreasonable stances against
council members, neglect of duty calling for protection of public
property and other misconduct, he said.
</P>
<P>
After repeated warnings issued to him which he ignored, the
members of the city council by a majority of votes decided to
remove him, he explained, adding that the city council has proposed
a successor for the major.

<HEADLINE> Thai Baht Exchange Rate Hits 5-Month Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Thai baht has recently fallen to
a five-month low exchange rate of 38.39 baht to the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said Wednesday the baht's tumble was the result
of foreign investors rushing to buy U.S. dollars in offshore money
markets, weakening the yen, the Singapore dollar, the Indonesian
rupiah and the Indian rupee.
</P>
<P>
An Analyst at a Thai commercial bank said Wednesday the baht's
fall was the product of two elements -- a hedge fund frenzy to buy
U.S. dollars and a fall by regional currencies, notably the rupiah,
the Singapore dollar and the Philippine peso.
</P>
<P>
He added that it is likely that baht will continue to fall to
between 38.45 baht and 38.50 baht to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Trade volume of Thai baht also largely declined. Trading volume
for Tuesday totaled 1.4 billion baht, the lowest figure since
April 5 last year.
</P>
<P>
Securities analysts attributed the market's dull activity to
the absence of an absolute financial sentiment. Speculation that
the United States' interest rates may be raised as much as 0.5
percent had also lured investors to U.S. dollar denominated assets.

<HEADLINE> Thai Govt Bans Mobile Phone for Drivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet has approved a ban
on motorists for using mobile phones, saying accidents resulting
from phone use have caused considerable economic damage, the
Bangkok Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Motorists face fines of up to 1,000 baht (28 U.S. dollars) if
caught talking on a mobile phone when driving.
</P>
<P>
"Part of road accidents, which have caused considerable
economic damage, is the use of mobile phones while driving," Thai
cabinet spokesman Somchai Sahaschairungruang was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was put to ministers by the National Police Office,
which told the cabinet that motorists using one hand to hold their
phones, or putting the devices between their shoulder and ear,
increased the chances of loss of concentration and vehicle control.
</P>
<P>
According to government statistics, there are some 3 million
owners of cellular phones registered in the country.

<HEADLINE> Global Forum Calls for More Funding on Killer Disease Research </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Global Forum for Health Research
has called on the public and private sectors worldwide to increase
the funding of research on the world's biggest killer diseases.
</P>
<P>
Less than 10 percent of the estimated 56 billion U.S. dollars
spent annually on health research by the public and private
sectors is devoted to diseases or conditions that account for 90
percent of the global burden of disease, the Geneva-based
organization said in its Report on Health Research 2000 released
here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It said that this economically costly and socially unfair
situation should be changed.
</P>
<P>
"The world's two biggest killer diseases, pneumonia and
diarrhea disease, illustrate the extreme mismatch between the
disease burden and the funding of research and development," said
the forum's chairman Professor Adetokunbo Lucas. "Although these
two 'killers' represent about 11 percent of the total global
burden of disease, only one-fifth of one percent of health
research funding is spent on them."

"Low and middle income countries have 85 percent of the world's
population and 92 percent of the global disease burden, whereas
high income countries have 15 percent of the world population and
only eight percent of disease burden," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the organization, of 7.7 million prenatal deaths
every year, 98 percent occur in the developing world. In the
United States, for example, the rate of neonatal deaths is five
per 1,000 live births, compared with 40 per 1,000 live births in
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
More than 90 percent of research funding is in the hands of a
small number of countries, which give priority to their own health
research needs, the forum said in the report. Decision-makers are
often unaware of the magnitude of problems beyond their borders
and, particularly, of the impact on their own countries of the
health situation in the rest of the world.

<HEADLINE> Computerized Transmission of Smells Studied in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Two senior scientists at Israel's
Weizmann Institute are researching the precise transmission of
scents through computers to supply the olfactory gap in the
multimedia communication age.
</P>
<P>
If they succeed, people will personally get smells while playing
computer games, surfing the Internet, watching television or
movies, listening to the radio, or even using the cellular phone,
the Ha'aretz newspaper reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The research will also facilitate the promising electronic-
commerce as it could provide smells of the commodities to their
potential customers through the net, involving them on the scene as
in a traditionally supermarket and stimulating there appetite to
purchase.
</P>
<P>
Professor David Harel, dean of the faculty of computer sciences
and mathematics at the Weizmann, and Professor Doron Lancet, a
biochemist also at the well-known institute, started their project
two and a half years ago.
</P>
<P>
They now had established an algorithms library to analyze each
smell through mathematical models and are planning to distribute
their first "olfactory sensor", or artificial nose, by the end of
this year, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
They hope their technology, which is expectedly in everyday use
in three to four years, will be recorded on history books as a
landmark in olfactory communication as photography and printing in
their respective areas.
</P>
<P>
Explaining their breakthrough, the two scientists like to draw
an analogy between the invention to the development of camera,
which capture the picture and later transmit it on the basis of
three basic colors: red, green and blue.
</P>
<P>
The case of the sense of smell is somehow more complicated, as
there are not three but hundreds of different basic receptors of
smell.
</P>
<P>
However, of the 500 to 1,000 receptors, about 150 basic smells
could be enough to act as smell ingredients, because the human nose
is not so advanced to distinguish the original from the electronic
forgery.
</P>
<P>
There is already a machine developed by other scientists that
can identify smells to a certain extent, and there is a fairly
primitive machine for producing smells, but there is no connection
between them. "This is exactly where we come in. We asked how it is
possible to transfer information about scent," Harel said.

<HEADLINE> Turkish PKK Rebels Flee Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Some 200 militants of the outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) have reportedly left their base in
Tunceli, east Turkey, for abroad, in compliance with the PKK
Leadership Council's call.
</P>
<P>
The group's action came after its leader Hamili Yildirim, PKK's
top official for the Tunceli region, was wounded in a shootout in
the course of the on-going operation in the region in which some
15,000 government troops are taking part.
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources were quoted by Turkish Daily News as saying
that Yildirim managed to get away after being wounded, and
contacted the organization's Leadership Council, which is the sole
remaining authority in the PKK since the capture of its leader
Abdullah Ocalan early last year.
</P>
<P>
Yildirim told the PKK leadership council that he would go abroad
for treatment and ask his 200 followers to stop armed struggle and
leave Turkish soil.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the group refused to obey an order, issued by the PKK
leadership council, to end armed attacks and leave Turkey in
accordance with Ocalan's call, opting to join up with "Partizan,"
another illegal armed group, in anti-government armed operations in
the Tunceli region.
</P>
<P>
With the disappearance of the 200 armed renegades, the PKK
intra-organizational rebellion has come to an end.
</P>
<P>
A controversy arose after Ocalan last year issued a call from
his prison cell on all his followers to lay down arms and pursue
their goal by peaceful means. Most complied while some factions
decided to go back to the mountains and stick to fight to the end.

<HEADLINE> Abu Sayyaf Offers to Release Hostage to Philippine Vice President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Muslim extremist group
Abu Sayyaf offered Wednesday to release their 27 remaining
hostages to Philippine Vice President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo if
the military halts offensives against them.
</P>
<P>
Abu Sayyaf spokesperson Abu Sabaya told a local radio station
that the group will actively participate in the negotiations for
the release of 21 hostages captured on April 23 from a Malaysian
diving-resort and brought to Sulu province in the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
"We are willing to free all the 27 hostages to concentrate on
the negotiations in Sulu. We can free the 27 hostages if the
military stops operations because we still have men in Basilan,"
Sabaya was quoted by DZMM radio as saying.
</P>
<P>
The 27 hostages, mostly children, were captured by the Abu
Sayyaf on March 20 and held in Basilan province since then.
Government troops have overrun several major camps of the Abu
Sayyaf in the province but failed to find the hostages.
</P>
<P>
In Sulu province two foreign hostages abducted from Malaysia
were reported died during a pre-dawn accident clash Wednesday
between government troops and Abu Sayyaf rebels.
</P>
<P>
Military officials have yet to verify the report, saying they
had no knowledge of any fatalities among the hostages.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Needs 5-10 Bln U.S. Dollars to Activate Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government needs
about 5 billion to 10 billion U.S. dollars to activate its economy
and boost the recovery of the real sectors, an economist said here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"To activate our economy from crisis, the government needs
around 5-10 billion U.S. dollars within this year. It means that
we now needs investment in a great scale," Chief Research of the
country's Danareksa Research Institute Raden Pardede told
reporters after addressing a Senior Officers Meeting for Ministers
' Meeting on Investment in Indonesia held by Indonesian Foreign
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, as many as 11 economic ministers from the Gulf
countries along with Indonesia's near neighbor countries are
expected to gather together here to discuss investment
opportunities in Indonesia to help the country come out of its
deepest economic crisis over past three years.
</P>
<P>
Pardede said that Indonesia's economy has showed signs of
recovery but "still need capital support to make it regain just
before crisis."
</P>
<P>
He expected that foreign investors will come here and bring
their foreign currency to make the country's currency of rupiah
more stable and then accelerate the economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Based on a survey, Pardede said, the economic recovery is
clearly on the road.
</P>
<P>
"Vehicle sales, retail sales continue to move upward. Building
permits are a good leading indicator and it clearly supports that
the recovery is under progress," Pardede added.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Deputy Chairman for International
Cooperation and Investment Promotion of the Indonesia's Ministry
of Investment and Promotion of State Enterprises Rizaldi Kasri
said that the government realizes that investment is one of the
key factors to overcome the crisis.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore it had taken many steps to attract foreign direct
investment from overseas through investment policies reform,"
Kasri said.

<HEADLINE> China, Myanmar to Strengthen Economic, Trade Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Minister for Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation Shi Guangsheng and two Myanmar
ministers held discussions here Wednesday, agreeing to further
strengthen the economic and trade ties between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The two Myanmar ministers are Minister of Commerce Brigadier-
General Pyi Sone and Minister at the Office of the Chairman of the
State Peace and Development Council Brigadier-General Abel.
</P>
<P>
The two Myanmar ministers said Myanmar-China border trade has
achieved firm development, adding that to further promote the
development, Myanmar plans to open more border trade points and
when the time is ripe, the country will sign an agreement with the
Chinese side on settlement of account through banks.
</P>
<P>
They thanked China for its economic assistance provided to
Myanmar for years, saying that Chinese companies are welcome to
set up factories in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
China has advanced technology and equipment, while Myanmar
possesses rich natural resources, they said, adding that these
superiorities will support each other in the joint development and
the two countries will be mutually benefited.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Chinese minister Shi noted that China and
Myanmar are friendly neighbors, linked by rivers and mountains.
</P>
<P>
This year is a year marking the 50th anniversary of the
establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Myanmar,
he said, adding that in the past 50 years, especially in recent
years, there are frequent exchange of visits at high level between
the two sides and their economic relations developed continuously.
</P>
<P>
Shi said that China-Myanmar border trade has become a new
growth point of the two countries' economy, believing that if the
two respective governments provide facilities in border trade
activities, enhance management and services in the sector, the two
countries' border trade could have a much greater development.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese government encourages financially
strong Chinese companies to make investment in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Present at the discussions were also Chinese Ambassador Liang
Dong and Economic and Commercial Counselor Jin Honggen.
</P>
<P>
Chinese minister Shi and his delegation, after attending the
one-day meeting of the economic ministers of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations and three northeast Asian dialogue
partners -- China, Japan and South Korea, began their three-day
official visit to Myanmar on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Before the official discussions, Chinese minister Shi and
Myanmar minister Abel, representing their respective governments,
signed an agreement on providing assistance to Myanmar for
building an agricultural machinery factory.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's GDP Growth Projected at 6.1 Percent in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Rating Agency Malaysia (RAM)
has projected Malaysia's gross domestic product (GDP) growth for
this year at 6.1 percent against the government projection of 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is in a good position to extend its strong economic
growth, the rating agency said in its "Economics Chartbook" for
April 2000 released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The continuing favorable demand conditions could render our
GDP forecast of 6.1 percent for Malaysia on the low end of the
attainable growth range for this year," the rating agency said.
</P>
<P>
RAM said import growth had outpaced export, reflecting rising
domestic demand -- a crucial factor to a self-sustaining recovery
against the risk of a U.S. economic slowdown affecting Malaysia's
export momentum.
</P>
<P>
"More importantly, two drivers of final domestic demand, namely
private consumption and investment spending, are strengthening in
response to simulative fiscal and monetary policies implemented
over the last two years," it added.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the continuing favorable external demand, especially
for electronics and other manufactured products, Malaysia's export
strength is also underpinned by a stable and competitive real
exchange rate which has facilitated market diversification by
Malaysian exporters and raised the relative attractiveness of
foreign capital inflow, it said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania's External Debt Burden Still Heavy: Govt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government has
told its creditors that the burden of external debt is still heavy
on the country despite a 2 billion U.S. dollar debt relief under
the enhanced Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, the
Guardian newspaper reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In an opening speech read on his behalf on Tuesday at a
consultative meeting held here on Public Expenditure Review for
the financial year 2000/ 2001, Tanzanian Minister for Finance
Daniel Yona said that the country still has a long way to go
before its debt burden problem is settled for good.
</P>
<P>
He told representatives of donor countries and international
lending institutions attending the meeting that Tanzania would
only start benefiting from the debt relief extended by the World
Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in the next two
decades.
</P>
<P>
"The relief by the IMF and the World Bank will be delivered
over a period of 10 and 20 years respectively commencing April,
2000," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government is committed to effectively using the
resources to be released under the debt relief to fight nationwide
poverty through improving the delivery of social services and
infrastructure, the minister told the two-day consultative meeting
jointly organized by the Tanzanian Treasury and the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Early in April, the IMF promised to write off 152 million U.S.
dollars from Tanzania's debt while the World Bank offered the
country a debt relief of 1.2 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Paris Club has provided an interim debt relief
worth about 390 million U.S. dollars to the African country, with
immediate cancellation of 90 percent of the debt service due to
them up to the completion point of the enhanced HIPC initiative.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts here said that the debt problem has remained
an obstacle to the overall economic progress in Tanzania, calling
for additional measures and innovative strategies.

<HEADLINE> Kenya to Start Voter Registration for 2002 Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Electoral Commission of Kenya
has announced that the registration of eligible voters for the
country's 2002 general election will start next week, the Daily
Nation newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Some 1.5 million people out of a population of 28 million in
the east African country are expected to register in the exercise
running from May 11 to June 9, said Chairman of the Electoral
Commission Samuel Kivuiti on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Another 9 million people will renew their registration in the
exercise, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Kivuiti, lack of funds is damaging the electoral
body's capacity to carry out a free, fair and well-organized
elections.
</P>
<P>
"We had asked for 60 million shillings (about 810,000 U.S.
dollars) from the Treasury Ministry for this voter registration
exercise but we got a paltry 20 million shillings (about 270,000
U.S. dollars)," he said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the commission would not be able to extend the
registration period beyond June 9 due to inadequate funds.

<HEADLINE> Lockerbie Trial Starts in Netherlands( </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The trial of two
suspects of the Lockerbie air bombing finally got underway on
Wednesday on Dutch soil After more than 11 years and then two
delays,.
</P>
<P>
Scottish judges Lord Sutherland, Lord Coulsfield and Lord
Maclean sat at the opening session, during which the two Libyans
accused were identified and the charges against them were read.
</P>
<P>
Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fahima were
charged with murder, conspiracy to murder and breaching the
international aircraft safety act.
</P>
<P>
The panel of the three judges must finally choose between three
verdicts: guilty, not guilty and not proven. If they chose the
first verdict, the two Libyans suspected in the bombing of the Pan
Am Flight 103 over the Scottish village of Lockerbie on December
21, 1988, would be sentenced to life and serve their term in
Scotland.
</P>
<P>
If the judges chose either of the other two verdicts, the two
Libyan accused would go free.
</P>
<P>
Defense lawyers revealed last week that they would employ a
special defense by blaming two organizations and 10 individuals
for the bombing instead of the two Libyan suspects.
</P>
<P>
The trial is expected to last at least one year and is
estimated to cost some 3 million U.S. dollars a month.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors, after interviewing 15,000 witnesses and collecting
200,000 pieces of evidence in the biggest murder investigation in
history, were convinced that they had had the culprits.
</P>
<P>
Court officials said that the court would hold sessions almost
daily through July 28 before adjourning until August 22.
</P>
<P>
Some family members of the Lockerbie victims were present at
Wednesday's opening session of the trial. Others remained and
watched live transmission of court proceedings in the Scottish
city of Dumfries, London, New York and Washington.
</P>
<P>
The bombing over Lockerbie killed 259 people on board the
Boeing 747 airliner and 11 others on the ground.
</P>
<P>
A three-year investigation led to the issuance in 1991 of an
arrest warrant for Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa
Fahima.
</P>
<P>
In August 1998, the United States and Britain accepted a Libyan
offer of a trial in the Netherlands under the Scots Law and the
two accused Libyans surrendered themselves to the Dutch police in
April the following year.
</P>
<P>
The three judges plus an additional judge were appointed in
November 1999. The usual Scottish court procedure has a 15-member
jury while the Lockerbie trial has no jury but has three judges to
decide the case.
</P>
<P>
On April 27 this year, the presiding judge of the Lockerbie
trial rejected a demand from prosecution to delay the start of the
trial once again.
</P>
<P>
Two delays were allowed previously both at the demand of the
defense team.

BEIRUT, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Israel bombed Wednesday morning
several abandoned military camps in Nabaiye, Legaful valley and
Iglem Tufaah in south Lebanon, Oriental Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
There were no immediate reports on casualties after the attacks.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night Israel raided south Lebanon and injured a
Lebanese. Resistance guerrillas retaliated by bombing Israeli
outposts alongside the border zone, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Israel has begun dismantling its military installations on
Tuesday in preparation for the withdrawal of its occupation forces
from the region by July.
</P>
<P>
Israel has occupied parts of south Lebanon since 1978. It set up
the present "security zone" in 1985 with the excuse of protecting
its northern settlements from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Iranian- and Syrian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has since
been leading a war of attrition aimed to oust the Israeli forces
the their proxy South Lebanon Army.

<HEADLINE> Turkey in for Forward-Looking Attitude to Athens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkey has made it clear that it would
not join the United States in criticizing Greece on the issue of
Abdullah Ocalan, leader of its outlawed Kurdish Workers' party
(PKK).
</P>
<P>
"Turkey has signed an agreement with Greece to fight jointly
against terrorism and what we are interested in is implementing
this agreement with Greece," Turkish Foreign Ministry
Undersecretary Faruk Logoglu said, quoted by the Daily News
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
In a report called "Patterns of Global Terrorism: 1999,"
Washington accused Greece of what it called one of the weakest
links in Europe's efforts against terrorism, citing Greece's
position regarding Ocalan as an example.
</P>
<P>
The report, dished out by the U.S. State Department, mentioned
basically the events related to the capture of Ocalan in Kenya and
terrorist attacks by PKK sympathizers in Europe in the aftermath of
his capture.
</P>
<P>
While praising Turkey for its efforts to combat terrorism, the
report criticized Greece and Italy for their roles in providing
shelters to Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was caught by Turkish commandos in Kenya in February last
year after hiding temporarily in Italy and Greece. The PKK he led
has been fighting for an independent Kurdish state in southeastern
Turkey since 1984.
</P>
<P>
Accused of being responsible for the PKK war that claimed 37,000
lives, Ocalan was sentenced to death by a Turkish court in June
last year. But the European Court of Human Rights has asked Turkey
not to execute Ocalan until it has reviewed the case, which could
take up two years.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish undersecretary said the report in which Ocalan was
mentioned was a U.S. report and that it criticized Greece, leaving
no room for Turkey to comment on it.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. published the report at a time when Athens and Ankara
were seeking to further improve the rapprochement between the two
North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies, landing Ankara in a
delicate position.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has always regarded the Kurdish issue as its internal
affairs and would not like to see others to make fuss about it,
said Daily News.
</P>
<P>
Despite Logoglu's statement that keeps Turkey out of the
discussion, diplomatic sources said Turkey does not want to make a
big issue out of it when Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem and
his Greek counterpart George Papandreou are meeting in New York in
a fresh bid to further improve relations.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, locked in disputes over the Aegean Sea and
Cyprus for decades, have cashed in on the mutual sympathy produced
by devastating earthquakes in their two countries last summer in a
process dubbed "earthquake diplomacy."
</P>
<P>
The new rapprochement was furthered during an exchange of visits
by the two foreign ministers earlier this year, which resulted in
the signing of a total of nine agreements, including the anti-
terrorism accord.
</P>
<P>
Cem and Papandreou, honored as architects of the Greek-Turkish
rapprochement, are now in New York to receive the "Statesman of the
Year" award given by the U.S.-based East-West Institute.
</P>
<P>
The two men are also scheduled to meet with U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Closes Awang Airport due to Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Wednesday that it has ordered the closure of the Cotabato Awang
Airport in the southern Philippines due to the peace and order
situation in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Air Transportation Office said it has issued a notice to
all airlines and pilots that effective 9:04 a.m. local time
Wednesday, the airport is closed due to fighting between
Philippine government troops and Moro Islamic Liberation Font (
MILF) rebels.
</P>
<P>
The closure of the airport came after members of the MILF used
rocket launchers and mortars to bomb the headquarters of the Army'
s Sixth Infantry Division (6ID) in Awang, creating massive
property damage in the compound and the runway of the airport.
</P>
<P>
The Infantry Division spokesman Major Julieto Ando said the
mortar fires caused no casualties.
</P>
<P>
MILF Vice-chairman Ghadzali Jaafar claimed that there are 300
MILF rebels still stationed in the Awang area to continue the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
However, Angelo Reyes, chief of staff of the Armed Forces of
the Philippines, said the bombing as only a small hit-and-run
operation meant to exert pressure on the military.
</P>
<P>
Fierce encounters between the two sides are also ongoing in the
towns of Aleosan and Pikit in Cotabato province and Matanog,
Buldon, Barira Talayan, Datu Piang and shariff Aguak in
Maguindanao.
</P>
<P>
In Tupi, South Cotabato province, Ando said MILF rebels blocked
the highway and flagged down passenger buses and cargo trucks
where the MILF is also holding some 70 civilians hostage since
Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
All three highways, the Cotabato-Davao; Cotabato-General Santos;
Ctabato-Bukidnon routes, remain closed to traffic practically
isolating Cotabato City from nearby regions.
</P>
<P>
Reports said MILF rebels are also holding some 300 hostages at
a fruit firm warehouse in Polomolok, South Cotabato as heavy
fighting continued in the region since mid-morning.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of evacuees from Cotabato City's remote villages and
the near environs have fled to the city's evacuation centers to
escape the worsening situation of skirmishes between the military
and MILF rebels.
</P>
<P>
The MILF is the major rebel group in the Philippine. It has
been fighting for an independent Muslim state in the southern
Philippines during the last two decades.

<HEADLINE> Malawi Temporarily Bans Mozambican Tobacco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican tobacco producers have
suffered an unexpected blow since the Malawian authorities
announced a temporary suspension of importing foreign tobacco leaf
last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique does not possess any tobacco processing industry of
its own and the growers in the country have their leaf processed
across the border in Malawi.
</P>
<P>
According to a report from the Pan-African News Agency
Wednesday, the ban followed a protest by Malawian tobacco growers
at low prices on the tobacco auction floors.
</P>
<P>
When the floors opened on April 17, the average top price was
moderately high, at two U.S. dollars per kilogram. But 30 minutes
into the sales, the price plummeted to a historic low of 10 U.S.
cents per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
Growers at main auction floors across the country protested at
the low price and forced a week's suspension of the sales.
</P>
<P>
The Tobacco Association of Malawi, the body that looks after
the interests of the tobacco growers, accused processing companies
of deliberately fixing prices by ferrying in foreign leaf, which,
they alleged, saturated the market thereby pushing prices down.
</P>
<P>
Albert Kamulaga, president of the association, claimed that
one of the companies had about 8,000 tons of foreign leaf stacked
away in its warehouse even before the auction floors opened.
</P>
<P>
But Charles Graham, chairman of the Tobacco Exporters
Association of Malawi, while admitting there were tobacco imports,
denied that foreign leaf was responsible for the low prices.
</P>
<P>
What the importers were doing, he said, was within Malawian
law, which allows companies in Zambia and Mozambique to bring
their leaf to Malawi for processing.
</P>
<P>
"The import of tobacco from Zambia and Mozambique has nothing
to do with the local leaf and therefore the exercise cannot affect
the ongoing tobacco sales," Graham said.
</P>
<P>
Despite this, the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation caved
in to the local growers and suspended all import of tobacco the
leaf from neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement, the Malawian ministry said the ban would
last until the end of May.
</P>
<P>
According to daily newspaper "Diario de Mocambique", high level
contacts are under way between the Mozambique and Malawi
governments to solve the problem: but if the Malawians stand by
the ban, the Mozambican growers plan to process their leaf in
Zimbabwe instead. About 60,000 Mozambican peasant households
grow tobacco, and every season some 8,000 tons of leaf are
processed in Malawi.
</P>
<P>
If the Mozambican growers are forced to process in Zimbabwe,
their transport cost will rise.

<HEADLINE> More Refugees Flock Into Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The number of refugees arriving in
Zambia's North-Western Province has continued to rise because of
the renewed fighting in Angola and the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC), The Post newspaper reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
(UNHCR) Regional Durable Solutions Officer Dominik Bartsch, 800
refugees entered the province from the DRC in April, with about
400 of them already transferred to the Maheba refugee settlement
area.
</P>
<P>
The increase is due to renewed fighting and heavy shelling in
Angola, Bartsch said on Tuesday, adding that last week alone 12
Angolan refugees entered the North-Western Province.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the official refuted reports that refugees at
Nangweshi and Sioma camps in the Western Province were starving.
The World Food Program was handing the distribution and the
refugees had enough food, he said.

<HEADLINE> Suspect Accused of Murdering Son of Kaunda Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- One of the two men accused of
murdering son of former Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda last
November pleaded guilty to the charge here on Tuesday, the Zambia
Daily Mail newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Moses Mulenga, 29, also admitted that he robbed Major Wezi
Kaunda's vehicle.
</P>
<P>
The suspect took his lawyer Anderson Mulemena by surprise when
he pleaded guilty and said he did not want to waste the time of
the Lusaka High Court.
</P>
<P>
Mulemena said he needed to confer further with Mulenga because
the guilty plea was contrary to the instructions issued earlier by
the client.
</P>
<P>
Mulenga's co-accused denied both counts of aggravated robbery
and murder.
</P>
<P>
The case was adjourned to Wednesday after the defense lawyer
asked for time to reorganize himself in view of change of
instructions from Mulenga.
</P>
<P>
Mulenga's case has been characterized by a series of
applications made at the subordinate court where he consistently
threatened to spill the beans if the nation was not told the truth
behind the death of Wezi.
</P>
<P>
At one time, he summoned the United Nations and the U.S.
embassy to visit him in prison where he was to divulge some of the
information.
</P>
<P>
Wezi was shot dead early November last year when he and his
wife were driving home about 10 kilometers away from downtown of
Lusaka.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland Begins to Sell Part of Gold Reserves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss National Bank (SNB) has
begun selling part of the country's gold reserves, following a
change in the law which came into force Monday.
</P>
<P>
Swiss Radio International quoted the SNB as saying that it
planned to sell a first tranche of up to 120 tons of gold by
September. The bank has commissioned the Basel-based Bank for
International Settlements with the sale of the first tranche.
</P>
<P>
The SNB plans to sell some 1,300 tons of gold over the next
five years. Switzerland's decision to formally abandon the gold
standard means that the SNB will sell off a maximum of 400 tons of
gold each year until the end of 2004. The SNB is one of Europe's
15 central banks, which set this ceiling last September in an
effort to maintain price stability.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss government has said it wants the income from the sale
of 500 tons of the gold to finance the planned Solidarity
Foundation.
</P>
<P>
Political parties and subdivision finance directors all have
their own ideas on how to spend the money. These include using the
money for the old-age pension scheme, to finance training and to
ease public debt.

<HEADLINE> Champions Spurs Eliminated, Mighty Lakers Beaten Again </HEADLINE>

<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 2 (Xinhua) -- San Antonio Spurs, with the
absence of its injured superstar Tim Duncan, Tuesday became the
first defending NBA champions in 16 years to go out in the first
round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
Penny Hardaway and NBA Sixth Man Award winner Rodney Rogers
scored 23 points each to lead the Phoenix Suns to a series-
clinching 89-78 victory over the Spurs.
</P>
<P>
As last year's championship MVP Duncan watched helplessly from
the sidelines in street clothes due to torn cartilage in his right
knee, the Suns got a huge emotional boost from the return of All-
Star point guard Jason Kidd.
</P>
<P>
In Sacramento, the remarkable Kings, feeding off a New Year's
Eve-like atmosphere from their raucous fans, outplayed the mighty
Lakers from start to finish for a stunning 101-88 victory.
</P>
<P>
"This is a game that Sacramento outplayed us from tip to buzzer,
" Lakers coach Phil Jackson said. "They were better than us for
the whole 48 minutes."
</P>
<P>
The Kings got another huge game from Chris Webber, who had 23
points, 13 rebounds, eight assists and six blocks.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody thought it was over baby," said Webber. "I'm just
proud of this organization and this team because it would have
been so easy quit to lose at home and have a vacation and say its
over with."
</P>
<P>
"They're a better team of course on paper," said Kings center
and former Laker Vlade Divac. "but sometimes the better team doesn
't win."
</P>
<P>
The fifth and deciding game will be Friday night in Los Angeles,
where the Lakers won the first two games of the series by
comfortable margins. The Lakers, who went an NBA-best 67-15 this
season, did not lose three straight games all year.
</P>
<P>
In Minnesota, the better team did win. Portland Trail Blazers,
however, closed out the Minnesota Timberwolves in four games.
</P>
<P>
Portland Trail Blazers used stifling defense down the stretch
to advance with an 85-77 victory over the Timberwolves.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Reformer Urges Allies to Be Patient </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 3 (Xinhua) -- A prominent Iranian reformist has
called on his allies to be patient and avoid radical conflict with
the conservatives until the convening of the sixth Majlis
(parliament) at the end of May.
</P>
<P>
The main objectives of the reformists should be the parliament
and the post of parliamentary speaker, Saeed Hajjarian, who was
seriously wounded in an assassination attempt in March and now
still sit in a wheelchair, was quoted by the pro-reformist daily
Iran News as saying on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Reformists supporting the president won an overwhelming victory
in February's parliamentary election, ending the long time
conservative control of the legislative body.
</P>
<P>
But the conservatives, still controlling most of the powerful
state organs, are unwilling to accept the defeat, and a series of
events against the reformist campaign have occurred since the
sensitive election.
</P>
<P>
Those events include the assassination attempt on Hajjarian, a
close ally of President Mohammed Khatami, the nullifying of partial
election results by the conservative watchdog Guardians Council
(GC), the arresting of reformist journalists and the latest closure
of 16 reformist publications by the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
The GC has yet to approve the election results of Tehran
constituency, where reformers bagged 29 of the 30 seats. It also
put off the runoff election from April to May 5.
</P>
<P>
Some 66 seats are to be decided in the runoff. The other 224
seats, including the unapproved 30 seats in Tehran, were elected in
the first round election on February 18.
</P>
<P>
In the face of the conservative offensive, President Khatami has
urged reformers to be calm and restrained and avoid impulsive
behavior that might be used by certain "elements".
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the Iranian Students News Agency (ISNA) on Tuesday,
Hajjarian echoed President Khatami's appeals. He urged reformers to
be patient until the runoff election is held on Friday, Tehran's
election results are given the final approval and the day (May 27)
come around for the new parliament to begin working.
</P>
<P>
Under the current situation, reformists must be vigilant,
because "in my view, what is happening now is being directed from
one single source," Hajjarian said.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian maintained that the wholesale closure of reformist
papers was "part of an orchestrated scenario."
</P>
<P>
The other acts of the scenario will be played out later.
However, the rest of the scenario is not so easy to predict, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian, vice chairman of the Tehran Municipal Council, was
shot in the face by a young gunman on March 12 in front of the
council building.
</P>
<P>
The attacker and its partners have been arrested and are facing
charges of assassination. Although reformers maintain that there
are plotters behind the doors, but the conservative judiciary say
the assassins are independently responsible for their crime.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian also met President Khatami on Tuesday, and he is to be
discharged from hospital Wednesday.

JERUSALEM, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Israeli newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Lebanese Hezbollah gunmen Tuesday night fired several mortar
rounds at the Livneh outpost of the Israeli army near Western
Galilee, increasing tension in the region two months before Israeli
scheduled withdrawal from the security zone in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
There were no casualties, although areas of the outpost and
several military vehicles were damaged. Israeli gunners returned
fire and warplanes later struck at Hezbollah targets near Yatar
village north of the zone and in the western sector of south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Ha'arez
</P>
<P>
-- Two senior scientists at the Weizman Institute in Rehovot
successfully encoded the transmission of smell through electronic
equipment. The breakthrough will enable people to experience the
sense of smell through computers, television, telephones, or cinema
screens.
</P>
<P>
As of now, the scientists have completed formulating the
mathematical formulae that prove the idea is possible, and they are
about to embark on the first stage of the experiment.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli President Ezer Weizman and his Polish counterpart
Aleksander Kwasniewski Tuesday led some 6,000 Jewish youth, elderly
Holocaust survivors, and Poles walking along the three-kilometer
path from Auschwitz to Birkenau death camp in the annual March of
the Living to commemorate the 6 million Jews perished in Europe
during Wold War II.
</P>
<P>
Weizman criticized the Poles who collaborated with the Nazis or
ignored the Holocaust and praised those who risked their lives on
behalf of Jews.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The tax reform package to be raised by the Israeli blue-
ribbon Ben-Bassat Committee has been widely supported by both the
coalition and the opposition, but some of the key elements could
face stiff opposition in the Knesset (parliament).
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Avraham Shochat has been meeting with key
Knesset leaders to persuade them to support the sweeping reforms,
which include lowering taxes on the middle class, imposing taxes on
various savings programs, a 10 percent inheritance tax, a tax on
stock market capital gains by individuals and cancellation of the
half-point tax credit for working wives.

<HEADLINE> IMF to Keep Open Mind in Loan Talks With Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) will keep an open mind during loan negotiations with Kenya
set to begin this Thursday, according to IMF resident
representative to Kenya Festus Osunsade.
</P>
<P>
"If the authorities put on the table facts and figures that
could serve as a basis to move ahead, then there will be an
agreement," the East African Standard daily Wednesday quoted
Osunsade as saying. "If not, we will keep talking."
</P>
<P>
If there is an agreement at this round of talks, the IMF team
would then prepare a detailed report to be submitted to the fund's
board for approval.
</P>
<P>
"It would take seven to eight weeks (from now) to bring the
process to closure -- that is absolute minimum time frame,"

<P>
An IMF team is scheduled to arrive in Kenya Thursday for
two-week long talks on a possible new loan deal to the east
African country.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government is hoping to conclude this round of
talks, saying that a new loan deal would boost foreign investment
and help reinvigorate its economy.
</P>
<P>
The IMF suspended a 205-million-U.S. dollar loan in 1997, which
has caused a slowdown in Kenya's economic growth in recent years.

<HEADLINE> General Motors, Trade Union Reach Tentative Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 2 (Xinhua) -- General Motors Corp., the
largest automaker in the world, Tuesday reached a tentative
agreement on a four-year contract with the union at its Moraine,
Ohio, plant ahead of a looming May 3 strike deadline, according to
a news release from the auto giant.
</P>
<P>
The deal with the International Union of Electrical Workers (
IUE), which represents approximately 3,800 workers at the plant,
is the second-to-last local union contract for the automaker to
wrap up, GM officials said.
</P>
<P>
Union members at the plant, upset with a two-tier wage system
that pays a third crew of workers less than two other crews, voted
against a tentative contract reached last November.
</P>
<P>
The IUE will hold an information meeting for members next
Sunday, and a ratification vote is expected next Tuesday and
Wednesday, a union spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
GM is still in negotiations with the United Auto Workers at its
Detroit Hamtramck Assembly plant.

<P>
PYONGYANG, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) and South Korea Wednesday reached an agreement on
a number of issues related to the working procedures for the first-
ever inter-Korean summit, the Korean Central News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached at the third round of talks for the
summit meeting between South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and
DPRK leader Kim Jong Il, which expected to be held on June 12-14
at DPRK's capital of Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
The third round of talks was held Wednesday at the Peace House
just south of the demilitarized zone bisecting the Korean
Peninsula and running through Panmunjom.
</P>
<P>
This summit would be the biggest diplomatic breakthrough in a
half century of confrontation between the two sides in the
peninsula.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Kim Kyong Song, head of the DPRK delegation,
said that the working procedures under discussion between the two
sides should define subjects to be taken up by the historic
Pyongyang summit and important events of the Korean nation.
</P>
<P>
He added that both sides had agreed to have contacts of working
officials in different fields at an early date.
</P>
<P>
It was also agreed upon to have the fourth preparatory contact

<HEADLINE> More U.S. Women Accept Sterilization For Contraception: Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 2 (Xinhua) -- A study released Tuesday said
sterilization had become the number one form of contraception in
the United States, surpassing even the Pill in popularity.
</P>
<P>
The study, conducted by researchers led by Dr. Carolyn Westhoff
and Dr. Anne Davis of Columbia University, reported that 11
million women, or 18 percent, rely on either their partner's
vasectomy or their own sterilization -- a figure that surprised
the researchers. Even more surprising, a third of these women are
not married.
</P>
<P>
That compares to about 10 percent of women who currently use
the birth control pill, the researchers reported their findings in
the journal Fertility and Sterility.
</P>
<P>
One of the main reasons behind the phenomenon, according to
Westhoff and Davis, is that women had been worried about the
health effects of the Pill.
</P>
<P>
In a second report in the same journal, Larry Bumpass and
colleagues at the University of Wisconsin said they found that one-
third of all recent tubal sterilization were performed on
unmarried women.
</P>
<P>
"Sterilization while unmarried is remarkably common among all
race or ethnic groups," the Wisconsin team wrote in their report.
</P>
<P>
They were also surprised to find that women are opting to have
their tubes tied rather than relying on their partner's vasectomy,
even though vasectomy is cheaper, quicker and safer.
</P>
<P>
The researchers noted that a third of all births now occur
outside marriage in the United States, in part because women are
delaying marriage.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 11,000 women aged 15 to 44 were interviewed at length
for the survey, conducted through the National Survey of Family
Growth.
</P>
<P>
In an unrelated study published Tuesday, the American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said it found 10 percent of the
750 women aged 18 or over surveyed by Gallup said they currently
used the pill.

<HEADLINE> Raids Continue on Rebels, Movement Restricted in Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal forces continued air
raids on rebel positions in Chechnya Wednesday as restrictions
were imposed in the breakaway republic to prevent rebel attacks
during the May holidays.
</P>
<P>
Su-24 assault planes and Su-24 bombers flew 10 sorties over the
past 24 hours, targeting mountain trails in southern Chechnya to
block rebel routes and rebel positions in mountain forests in the
south and southeast regions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mi-24 helicopter gunships took off 30 times to
provide air support for ground troops.
</P>
<P>
Amid mounting incidence of rebel attacks, the federal command
has restricted the movement of citizens across the republic during
the May holidays to prevent subversive and terrorist acts,
Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
The movement of motor columns has been banned from May 1 to 11,
the headquarters of the combined federal grouping said.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Chechnya remains complicated and federal
checkpoints have come under attacks for five to eight times over
the past 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
"The rebels operate in mobile groups consisting of five to 15
members, and carry out sorties to populated areas and to the
flatland," Interfax quoted the headquarters as saying.
</P>
<P>
In another development, three policemen were killed Tuesday
when their car came under fire on the Argun-Kizlyar motorway. The
three were sent to Chechnya from Novorossiisk, Interfax said,
quoting the Interior Ministry's Department for Chechnya.

WASHINGTON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Moroccan-born Khalid Khannouchi
was sworn in as a U.S. citizen in Houston on Tuesday, in time to
compete at the U.S. Olympic men's marathon trials on Sunday in
Pittsburgh if he chooses.
</P>
<P>
Khannouchi, the marathon world record-holder, finished third in
the London Marathon on April 16, but aggravated a sore right
hamstring and sprained an ankle in the race. But even if he doesn'
t bid for a marathon berth in Pittsburgh, he would be a formidable
figure in the 10,000 meters at July's U.S. Olympic athletics
trials.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Indianapolis, USA Track and Field
chief Craig Masback welcomed Khannouchi aboard. Khannouchi moved
to New York in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Khannouchi stunned the athletics world when recording a time of
two hours five minutes and 42 seconds in Chicago last year in only
his fourth marathon. The diminutive 28-year-old is the only man to
have run below twe hours and six minutes for the event.

<HEADLINE> Serious Knee Injury Forces Andersson out of Euro 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, May 2 (Xinhua) -- AIK Stockholm's Swedish
intrenational striker Andreas Andersson will miss the Euro 2000
finals after suffering a severe knee injury in his side's 1-0 win
over Trelleborg in a first division match on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The 26-year-old, formerly with AC Milan in Italy and Newcastlke
United in England, will be out for at least six months after an
examination on Tuesday showed his right cruciate ligament had been
torn from the bone. The injury could end his career.
</P>
<P>
A week ago AIK Stockholm defender Pontus Kamark suffered a
similiar injury which will also keep him out of the finals and
sideline him for at least four months. AIK coach Stuart Baxter
said: "This is a difficult situation for our club. Pontus and
Andreas are two national team players and it will not be easy to
replace them."
</P>
<P>
Andersson, who scored Sweden's opening goal in the qualifying
competition in a 2-1 win over England in September 1998, joined
AIK late last season after two miserable years in Milan and
Newcastle.
</P>
<P>
Before moving abroad he scored 48 goals in 69 matches in the
Swedish first division for IFK Gothenburg, but he never recaptured
that form abroad.

Colombo, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Under a loan scheme with 7.9
million U.S. dollars provided by Asian Development Bank, Sri
Lanka proposes to bring about a permanent solution to its coastal
belt prone to sea erosion, a Sinhalese newspaper here reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Sri Lanka's 1700 kilometers of coastline is a great asset
but was being threatened by sea erosion, especially in the West,
South west and Southern areas of the country, a senior official of
the Fisheries Ministry was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
A new master plan for coast conservation and development would
be launched soon using modern coast protection technologies
developed by the Netherlands, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that sea erosion directly affected the fishing
and tourist industries. It also damaged the infrastructure
facilities provided to fishermen.
</P>
<P>
Often fishing craft and gear were destroyed and nightmare
experience of violent sea erosion conditions destroyed permanent
houses of fishermen.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry will establish an Oceanographic University
providing courses on a number of disciplines affiliated to the
fishing industry.

<HEADLINE> April Auto Sales Brisk in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Despite fluctuations in the
stock market and higher bank rates, auto sales remained brisk in
the United States in April, with Japan's Mitsubishi Motors Corp.
sales jumping 55.2 percent, the highest among automakers, company
reports said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Ford Motor Co., the world's No. 2 auto manufacturing firm, said
it registered a 12.1 percent increase in its light-vehicle sales
in the United States in April, topping the figures for U.S.
automakers.
</P>
<P>
General Motors, the world's No. 1 automaker, reported a light
vehicle sales gain of 2 percent to 423,215 units, including its
Saab Swedish car unit. Its car sales slipped 2.5 percent while
truck sales rose 7 percent, below analyst expectations of a 9-13
percent increase.
</P>
<P>
Chrysler side of DaimlerChrysler, the world's No. 5 automaker,
posted a 6 percent increase among its American brands to 228,992,
with trucks up 4.3 percent and cars ahead a better-than-expected 9.
1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Besides Mitsubishi Motors Corp., several other Japanese
automakers also set new records for the month. Toyota Motor Corp.
sales rose 15.7 percent and Honda Motor Co. posted a 14.7 percent
increase.
</P>
<P>
Industry analysts said that high consumer confidence, low
unemployment and generous incentives combined to offset market
fluctuations, interest rate increases and still-high gasoline
prices last month.
</P>
<P>
"It appears that people were unbothered by the shifts in the
stock market," said Christopher Cedergren, an analyst at industry
consultant Nextrend, who expects 2000 total sales to top last
year's record.
</P>
<P>
While total industry sales in April are expected to slow from
the hot first-quarter pace of 18.3 million units, analysts see a
healthy 6 percent increase on a unit basis from the same month a
year ago. Percent changes are based on a daily selling rate. April
had 25 selling days, one less than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Some industry leaders said sales got a temporary boost with cut-
rate financing deals and cash rebates that were too high to
sustain.

<HEADLINE> Seoul, Pyongyang Start Third Round Talks on Inter-Korean Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANMUNJOM, South Korea, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Negotiators of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and South Korea on
Wednesday began their third round of talks here to prepare for the
first-ever inter-Korean summit scheduled for June 12-14 in the
DPRK capital of Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
The talks started at 10 a.m. Wednesday in the Peace House on
South Korea-controlled side of the truce village of Panmunjom.
</P>
<P>
Panmunjom, also known as "Joint Security Area," is a 800-meter-
radius circle having a cluster of some 30 buildings, including
observation posts, used by the DPRK, the United Nations, and
neutral nations supervising the Korean War armistice.
</P>
<P>
Panmunjom, where the armistice was signed at the end of the
Korean War in the early 1950s, has served as the single contact
point between the DPRK and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe the two sides are expected to reach an
agreement at Wednesday's talks on agenda and procedures for the
planned meeting between South Korean President Kim Dae-jung and
DPRK leader Kim Jong Il, which was announced on April 10 by both
sides.
</P>
<P>
They say the two sides would have little difficulty in striking
a deal on procedural matters, including protocols, security and
communications similar to those set in 1994 for a summit between
then South Korean President Kim Young-sam and the late DPRK
President Kim Il Sung. The summit failed to realize due to the
sudden death of Kim Il Sung.
</P>
<P>
At the past two preparatory meetings held here last week which
were said to be "very positive and pragmatic," both sides showed
enthusiasm to reach an accord on agenda and procedural matters.
</P>
<P>
At the two talks, Seoul proposed that the summit agenda should
be based on Kim Dae-jung's Berlin declaration, which calls for
inter-Korean economic cooperation, reunions of separated families,
peaceful coexistence and establishment of a regular dialogue
channel.
</P>
<P>
On its part, Pyongyang suggested that the summit should be
based on the 1972 Joint Communique which stipulates independence,
peace and national unity as principles.
</P>
<P>
South Korean officials said both sides are coming to an
agreement on the route of Kim Dae-jung's trip to Pyongyang and
the size of his delegation and a press corp at Wednesday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
Observers said South Korea will try to get Pyongyang's
guarantee on Kim Jong Il's return visit to Seoul to make inter-
Korean summit a regular event, but Pyongyang is expected to
propose to leave the matter to the two top leaders themselves.
</P>
<P>
Ahead of the third meeting, DPRK media urged the United States
to withdraw troops from South Korea and appealed to Seoul to scrap
its National Security Law.

<HEADLINE> American Airlines Orders 20 Boeing 757s </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, May 2 (Xinhua) -- American Airlines, the world's
second largest airline, said on Tuesday that it will buy 20 Boeing
757-200 jetliners, worth more than 1.4 billion U.S. dollars,
according to a news release from the company.
</P>
<P>
Deliveries of the jets will begin next year and continue
through 2002. The order, the largest in dollar amount for Boeing
so far this year, pushes the 757 series over the 1,000-order mark
to 1,009, over its 17-year history, the news release from Boeing
said.
</P>
<P>
The 757 deliveries set for 2001 through 2002 will modestly
expand the fleet of Fort Worth, Texas-based American Airlines, a
unit of AMR. Corp., which will also retire some smaller MD-80 and
MD-90 model aircraft.
</P>
<P>
"Retiring the MD-90s and MD-87s represents two important steps
toward simplifying the American fleet," Don Carty, chairman and
chief executive of AMR. and American Airlines, said in a statement.
"The purchases will also allow for additional growth in the 2001
and 2002 time-frame."
</P>
<P>
"The 757 is so fuel efficient, it makes sense for them to
retire the less fuel-efficient airplanes in their fleets and use
their 757s," said Boeing Executive Vice President for Sales and
Marketing Seddik Belyamani.
</P>
<P>
Boeing has received orders for 152 aircraft so far this year,
and had delivered 75 as of March 31. The company hopes to deliver
490 aircraft by year's end despite a 40-day engineers' strike that
halted deliveries in February and March.
</P>
<P>
France-based Airbus Industrie, Boeing's only commercial jet
rival, had 85 orders for new aircraft as of April 27.

<HEADLINE> Polgar Wins JAPFA Chess Classic Tournament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Grand Master (GM) Judit Polgar of
Hungary won the 56,500 U.S. dollars JAPFA Classic chess tournament
after beating GM Gilberto Milos of Brazil in the final round in
Bali, Indonesia, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to reports reaching here Wednesday, Polgar had a hard
task with Black before stopping his Brazilian opponent in 44 moves
in a Sicilian game.
</P>
<P>
The win put Polgar at the top of the table as the sole winner
because her closest rivals GM Anatoly Karpov (Russia) and GM
Alexander Khalifman (Russia), who met each other on the day, could
only play out a draw. They agreed to tie in the 64th move using
the Petrov defense.
</P>
<P>
The United States GM Yasser Seirawan drew with Indonesian GM
Utut Adianto after only 21 moves in a Queen's Gambit.
</P>
<P>
GM Jan Timman (the Netherlands) rounded off his shaky
performance with a win over Indonesian GM Ruben Gunawan. Holding
Black, Timman stopped Ruben in 56 moves in a Queen's Indian game.
</P>
<P>
International Master Zaw Win Lay of Myanmar upset GM Jaan
Ehlvest, beating the Estonian in a Modern Defense after 62 moves.
</P>
<P>
The JAPFA Classic was the second men's tournament that Polgar,
the only woman among 10 participants, won. Her first was at the
Madrid tournament in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Polgar said she was satisfied with her
performances because she was able to outshine all of her
competitors.
</P>
<P>
"I'm satisfied. To win in a tournament certainly gives me a
good feeling. I have been playing against men all of my life but
that isn't the main reason for my happiness. The main reason is
that the tournament is attended by good players, and it's great to
win here," she was quoted by the Jakarta Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
Following are the final standings:
</P>
<P>
1. Judit Polgar, 6.5 points
</P>
<P>
2. Anatoly Karpov, 6
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Raises Concern Over Drug Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid Tuesday slammed athletes who have been using drugs, citing
the use of banned substance as totally contradictory to the spirit
of sport.
</P>
<P>
The president also hoped that all parties will work together to
avoid the poor behavior shown by several soccer players from
spreading to other athletes, particularly badminton players.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the Indonesian shuttlers will stay away from the use of
banned drugs," the president was quoted by the Indonesian Observer
Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the badminton delegation who will be competing in
the upcoming Thomas Cup and Uber Cup championships in Kuala Lumpur,
Wahid urged them to keep up their determination to bring home the
winning trophies from the world's most prestigious championships.
</P>
<P>
A delegation comprising the country's top 20 shuttlers along
with their coaches and officials, paid a visit to the presidential
palace on Tuesday before heading for the events, which are
scheduled to be held from May 11 to 21.
</P>
<P>
The allegations of drug abuse among soccer athletes currently
rocking the country have raised serious concern within the
national sports community which fears the future development of
sports in this country may be placed in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
The National Sports Committee (KONI) said it has received
information that 60 percent of soccer players affiliated with the
National Football Association are regular users of drugs,
particularly amphetamine and ecstasy, which they say relieves them
of fatigue.

<HEADLINE> No Olympic Athletes Using Illegal Drugs, Says Indonesian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's National Sports Council
(KONI) Vice Chairman Arie Sudewo announced that no Olympic
athletes had been using illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
He based his announcement on the results of physical and
medical tests conducted by the council's sports science commission
in March.
</P>
<P>
"The test results, which included urine and blood tests, were
negative. They did not detect any illegal drugs," he was quoted by
the Jakarta Post Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
KONI plans to stage a second series of tests prior to the
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"If any athletes are found to be using illegal drugs, I won't
hesitate to expel them from the centralized training program. They
will not be allowed to compete in the Olympics and I will also
send them to a rehabilitation center," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Arie encouraged sports organizations not to condemn
drug users but ask them to book into rehabilitation centers to
recover from their addictions.
</P>
<P>
"Sports officials are responsible for curing them from drug
addiction. Should they recover, they can rejoin the training
program. In the mean time, they must accept international
federation punishments," he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the involvement of the police in the investigation
into illegal drug use and trade in the sports community, Arie said
KONI needed to coordinate with them.
</P>
<P>
"They can scrutinize athletes in the training centers or the
Ragunan sports school but they must work together with us. We can
guarantee the police that we are actively conducting urine and
blood tests on our athletes to detect their usage of drugs," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Asia-Pacific Advertising Market Recovers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Asia-Pacific advertising market
has walked out of the haze of a financial crisis and begun to
recover.
</P>
<P>
According to a latest survey in a dozen advertising markets in
the Asia-Pacific region by the AC Nielsen, a world-famous market
and media research institution, seven of the markets report double-
digit increases in advertising expenditures in 1999. The growth
rates of Indonesia, the Republic of Korea and Thailand reached 40,
33 and 31 percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese mainland spent 6.1 billion US dollars in
advertising, remaining the region's largest advertising market.
Hong Kong's expenditures reached three billion US dollars, up 14
percent on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
Authorities attributed the increase to the upgrading of
information technology and the development of e-commerce and
Internet economy.
</P>
<P>
One example is that the advertising expenditure in computers
and mobile phones doubled the figure of 1998 in the Chinese
mainland.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that TV is still the largest advertising
media in the region.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia to open four new
commercial courts next week to help accelerate the resolution of
the massive corporate debt overhang, according to Minister of Law
and Legislation Yusril Ihza Mahendra.
</P>
<P>
"I will officially open the new courts on May 8," the minister
was quoted by the Jakarta Post Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the new courts, also known as a bankruptcy court, will
locate at Surabaya (East Java), Semarang (Central Java), Medan (
North Sumatera) and Makassar (South Sulawesi) respectively.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has so far set up only one commercial court in
Jakarta since the bankruptcy law became effective in October 1998.
</P>
<P>
Mahendra said a presidential decree was expected to be issued
soon on the appointment of nine ad hoc judges. The list of the
nine ad hoc judges had been sent to President Abdurrahman Wahid.
</P>
<P>
The ad hoc judges are assigned to handle certain cases
involving complex business transactions that may require various
areas of legal jurisprudence in the commercial court, the minister
added.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Indonesian Bank Restructuring Agency (
IBRA) has demanded the assignment of ad hoc judges to handle its
bankruptcy petitions against several recalcitrant debtors.

<HEADLINE> 1,700 Bulgarian Computers Hit by CIH Virus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, May 2 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,700 computers were contaminated
with the CIH virus, also known as the Chernobyl virus, on April 26,
said Evgeni Nikolov, Director of the National Laboratory of
Computer Viruses with the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He would not indicate whether computers of the government and
the National Assembly have been affected.
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 computers were affected last year, Nikolov added.
</P>
<P>
The Chernobyl virus has spread in four versions numbered as 1.1,
1.2, 1.3 and 1.4, said Nikolov, adding that it is possible that 1.
5 and 1.6 versions have also appeared. But this has not been
proved.
</P>
<P>
The 1.1 and 1.2 versions are being activated on April 26 for a
third successive year, 1.3 on May 26 and 1.4 on the 26th day of
every month, said Nikolov.
</P>
<P>
The 1.1 and 1.2 versions are widespread and this is why the
virus has been dubbed "Chernobyl," referring to the disastrous
accident of nuclear power plant in the former Soviet Union on the
same day, April 26, 1986.
</P>
<P>
The virus damages the hard disc and the restoration is very
tough, even impossible sometimes, Nikolov noted.
</P>
<P>
All anti-virus programs drafted or updated since September 1998
can recognize and stop the virus, said Nikolov. The problem is
that a lot of people underestimate the danger and do not run these
programs, he said.
</P>
<P>
The viruses rarely affect computers of young people who are
aware of the problem, instead the most affected are those of
accountants, lawyers and medics who use unscanned discs and surf
the web without using anti-virus programs, Nikolov added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government to Intensify Efforts to Win PNTR for China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The White House will intensify its
efforts to win the congressional approval of the permanent normal
trade relations (PNTR) status for China in the coming weeks to
pave the way for China's entry into the World Trade Organization (
WTO), U.S. National Security Advisor Samuel Berger said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a gathering at the East Asian Institute of Columbia
University, Berger said he was optimistic about the congressional
vote in late May despite the fact that some labor unions were
lobbying hard against the normal trade status for China.
</P>
<P>
The White House needs to win 218 votes to pass the PNTR through
the 435-member House of Representatives, which is scheduled to
begin debates over the issue on May 22. The bill's passage in the
Senate is almost secure.
</P>
<P>
Berger, who carries much weight on U.S. security and foreign
policy, said that meetings were planned between the White House
and Congressmen in the coming three weeks and that the government
would try its utmost to persuade the undecided lawmakers to take
the right side.
</P>
<P>
The United States and China signed a landmark trade agreement
in Beijing last November, under which the U.S. must give China the
PNTR status, a trade status Washington grants to almost all of its
trading partners. China has been given the normal trade status,
but on the basis of annual renewal.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton and his cabinet members have tried hard
in the past few months to honor the commitment to making China's
normal trade status permanent so as to clear the ground for its
accession to the WTO. But some labor unions openly opposed the
deal for fears that many Americans will lose their jobs in the
face of inexpensive Chinese commodities.
</P>
<P>
Apparently in a bid to ease their concerns, Berger said, "We
will have much better access to a market of over a billion people;
that will mean more American exports, growth and jobs."
</P>
<P>
"What the Congress must decide is whether America will enjoy
the benefits of the agreement we negotiated, or whether we will
forfeit those benefits to our competitors in Europe and Japan," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Berger warned that if China's PNTR is blocked, not only the U.S.
economic interest but also its national security would be hurt.

<HEADLINE> Poland, Israel Commemorate Auschwitz Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, May 2 (Xinhua) - Presidents of Israel and Poland joined
Jews and Poles in an annual March at the former Auschwitz death
camp, in southern Poland, on Tuesday in remembrance of more than
one million Jews murdered there.
</P>
<P>
The March of the Living brought elderly Holocaust survivors
together with thousands of students from Israel, Poland and other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Israeli President Ezer Weizman and Polish President Aleksander
Kwasniewski, their wives and several Israeli parliament members
led the marchers through the main Auschwitz gate to the camp's gas
chambers at Birkenau, three kilometers away, where the Nazis
killed more than one million Jews from 1940 to 1945.
</P>
<P>
About six million Jews were killed by the Nazis during World
War II between 1939 and 1945.
</P>
<P>
The march ended at the monument to all of the camps' victims
with Weizman, 76, recalling the fate of the perished and stressing
the need to keep their memory as a warning for future generations.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the Jews and other peoples would join forces to
build a secure and peaceful world.
</P>
<P>
"I share your pain and reflection," Kwasniewski, 46, told the
marchers, "We are here together to make sure that nobody, neither
people nor nations, are ever again threatened with annihilation."
</P>
<P>
The first march at Auschwitz was organized by the Israeli
education ministry in 1988 on a biannual basis. Marches have been
held each year on Israel's annual Holocaust Martyrs and Heroes
Remembrance Day since 1997.

<P>
BEIJING, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Four precious Qing Dynasty (1644-
1911) cultural relics, looted from the Yuanmingyuan in 1860 and
auctioned in Hong Kong have all been recovered for China at
exorbitant prices, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
A hexagonal porcelain vase was auctioned by Sotheby's for 2.4
million U.S. dollars to the Beijing Cultural Relics Co. Tuesday,
while a bronze tiger head was sold for 1.8 million U.S. dollars to
an unidentified Chinese buyer.
</P>
<P>
In a previous auction by Christie's on Sunday, a bronze monkey
head and a bronze ox head were purchased by the Beijing-based
China Poly Group for approximately 2 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Relics experts believed the three bronze animal heads were
taken from the same water clock in the imperial garden that
featured the heads of the 12 animals of the Chinese zodiac.
</P>
<P>
The four auctioned items were looted by the British and French
invading troops from Yuanmingyuan (known as Old Summer Palace) in
northwestern suburb of Beijing during the Second Opium War in 1860.
</P>
<P>
Auctions of the looted Chinese antiques not only stirred rage
among Chinese relics experts and Hong Kong residents, but also
prompted legal concerns over relics protection measures.
</P>
<P>
Ten days before the auction started, the State Bureau of
Cultural Relics informed the Two auction houses that the looted
relics belonged to China and asked them to cancel the auction.
</P>
<P>
However, the two firms ignored the urges and claimed the
antique sales did not violate any laws in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
China joined an international convention on cultural relics in
1995, which supports all countries' endeavors to recover relics
looted or lost in wars, regardless of when the war took place or
when the request was made to return the relics.

<HEADLINE> Revival of Traditional Chinese Kunqu Opera </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUZHOU, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Kunqu Opera, dubbed the "mother of
traditional Chinese operas", is showing signs of making a comeback
thanks to efforts to save it over the past several decades.
</P>
<P>
The First Chinese Kunqu Opera Art Festival held here recently
not only attracted dozens of Kunqu Opera troupes from all over
China but also drew some from Japan and the United States.
</P>
<P>
During the one-week festival, co-sponsored by the Chinese
Ministry of Culture, the Jiangsu Provincial People's Government,
and the Suzhou City People's Government, domestic and overseas
performers presented a repertoire of famous Kunqu compositions,
including Peony Pavilion, Palace of Eternal Youth, and Peach
Blossom Fan, performed to packed theaters.
</P>
<P>
Vice Minister of Culture Pan Zhenzhou said the revival in Kunqu
Opera was due to a series of drastic reforms over the past several
decades.
</P>
<P>
One of the country's classical operatic forms, Kunqu Opera
originated in the Kunshan region of Jiangsu Province in east China
about 500 years ago. The music and acting of Kunqu Opera have had
a significant influence on other traditional Chinese operatic
forms, including Peking Opera. However, it has lost its appeal to
audiences over the past century because the opera was too elitist.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, the Ministry of Culture formed the Kunqu Opera
Revitalizing Instruction Committee to save the traditional opera
from extinction.
</P>
<P>
Artists have been trying to make plots more contemporary.
Humorous plots and fierce fighting movements have been added to
enliven Kunqu works.
</P>
<P>
Electric displays showing the words of actors and actresses and
other modern equipment have been introduced to theaters to help
the audience.
</P>
<P>
"The unique beauty of Kunqu Opera is now appreciated by an
increasing number of people," said Pan. "The opera is well on the
way to a renaissance."

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- The head of the World Boxing Council
(WBC) has backed plans for a world heavyweight title clash between
Lennox Lewis and Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
WBC president Jose Sulaiman, a heavyweight in the sport himself,
believes rivalry between the television stations which bankroll
the fighters can be ironed out.
</P>
<P>
"I believe Tyson will fight Lewis provided there is a big
enough purse offer," said Sulaiman.
</P>
<P>
Lewis retained his WBC and IBF titles when he stopped Michael
Grant in two rounds in New York on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Tyson is continuing his comeback following last year's prison
release with a planned series of fights throughout this year.
</P>
<P>
Tyson aims to fight for the world title after a series of
comeback fights.
</P>
<P>
Lewis is contracted to HBO (Home Box Office), while Tyson's
paymasters are Showtime.
</P>
<P>
But Sulaiman said the two pay-per-view US TV firms can be
persuaded to agree to a fight which the boxing public wants to see.
</P>
<P>
"Boxing cannot accept monopolies, even from the devil," he said.
"I believe the fight will happen."

Silverstone, was heading home to Monaco when the jet developed
engine trouble en route from Farnborough in Hampshire to Nice.
</P>
<P>
The British pilots were killed as the cockpit bore the full
brunt of the crash after they had radioed ahead to the airport in
central France requesting an emergency landing.
</P>
<P>
Coulthard, who earns around two million pounds a year driving
for McLaren Mercedes, and his two fellow passengers managed to
scramble from the back of the plane.
</P>
<P>
The wreckage of the stricken Learjet, which Coulthard uses to
take him to races and testing, was left by the side of the runway
with a gaping hole marking where the cockpit and nose were.
</P>
<P>
Parts of the plane lay in the long grass nearby surrounded by
hastily erected cordons marking the crash site. Badly twisted
metal and wires could be seen hanging from the main body of the
jet near to where it appeared the cockpit had been literally
ripped off by the impact.

<HEADLINE> Arsenal Beats West Ham United in Premier League  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 2 (Xinhua) -- One injury time goal from French
midfielder Emmanuel Petit gave Arsenal a 2-1 victory over West Ham
United in a English premier league match on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
With the win, Arsenal may secure a place in the Champions
League next season.
</P>
<P>
The victory, Arsenal's 11th in a row, takes them into second
place in the table on 69 points with three games remaining.
</P>
<P>
Although Manchester United have already clinched the title,
Arsenal's win puts them three points clear of Liverpool in the
chase for the second automatic Champions League spot and five
clear of Leeds.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea are fifth, seven points behind Arsenal, and visit
Highbury on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Trailing 1-0 with 20 minutes remaining, Arsenal equalised
through Marc Overmars and clinched it when Petit, a second half
substitute, saw his left footed shot deflected past 18-year-old
goalkeeper Steve Bywater.
</P>
<P>
West Ham suffered a double blow in the last two minutes of the
match, first by conceding Petit's goal and then having Trevor
Sinclair sent off after he picked up two yellow cards in 60
seconds.
</P>
<P>
West Ham went ahead five minutes before halftime when Sinclair
did well to cut the ball back for Paolo Di Canio to blast a low
shot past David Seaman.
</P>
<P>
The north-east derby between Middlesbrough and Newcastle United
at the Riverside Stadium finished 2-2.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian Juninho had put Middlesbrough ahead with a rare
header after five minutes and after Kieron Dyer missed a sitter
for Newcastle, the England international set up Gary Speed for the
equaliser in the 10th minute.
</P>
<P>
Alessandro Pistone put Newcastle ahead in the 18th minute with
his first goal of the season but Gianluca Festa earned
Middlsbrough a point with a diving header 12 minutes from time.
</P>
<P>
Newcastle remain in 13th place, ahead of Middlesbrough on goal
difference.

<HEADLINE> Peace with Israel Still Possible: Syrian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk Shareh
said Wednesday that there was still chance of establishing peace
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
"Contacts in this regard did not stop," he told reporters after
meeting with visiting Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa and
Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal, according to the
Arab-Syrian News Agency.
</P>
<P>
"Syria clearly supports efforts to establish fair and
comprehensive peace," Shareh said, adding that "at least all Arabs
know that Israel was the party that plants obstacles on the road to
peace."
</P>
<P>
Syria and Lebanon offer joint proposals for fair and
comprehensive peace with Israel under the references of the 1991
Madrid Peace Conference and the relevant United Nations
resolutions. "I made this statement weeks ago, but Israel has not
responded so far," he added.
</P>
<P>
"This Syrian position is clear to everybody," he stressed. Syria
demands that Israel return in full the Golan Heights it captured in
1967 from Syria.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian top diplomat urged the United States to take a fair
and unbiased stance toward the Arab-Israeli peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace talks were resumed in Washington last
December after a four-year freeze, but hit a snag in January due to
Israel's refusal to pledge a total withdrawal from the Golan to the
borders of June 4, 1967.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Urges Clarification of Election Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami on
Wednesday urged the conservative Guardians Council (GC) to clarify
the parliamentary election results in Tehran constituency as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of the final results of the Majlis (parliament)
elections in Tehran is expected to be done sooner because of its
sensitivity and importance, Khatami said at a cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
He also called on the people to massively participate in the
runoff election, to be held on Friday in 52 constituencies to
decide the remaining 66 seats in the 290-member Majlis, the
official Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Describing the Majlis as "embodiment of the people's will,"
Khatami expressed hope that the new parliament to be dominated by
reformists would start work on time despite the annulment of
balloting results in some constituencies by the GC.
</P>
<P>
In February's first round election, reformists allied with
Khatami won more than 75 percent of the 224 seats decided, ending
the long-time conservative majority in the legislative body.
</P>
<P>
In Tehran, reformists won 29 of the 30 seats. But the
conservative GC, watchdog of the election, has yet to approve the
results in this critical constituency, ordering several recount of
votes for "reasons of vote rigging."
</P>
<P>
The conservatives, still controlling most of the powers, have
recently stepped up crackdown on the reformists, including
arresting reformist journalists and closing newspapers and
publications.
</P>
<P>
Facing the sensitive situation, Khatami urged his reformist
allies to keep calm and restrained before the new parliament
convenes on May 27.

The two leaders discussed the latest developments of the Middle
East peace process, especially on the Palestinian-Israeli track, as

Arafat arrived in the Omani capital Wednesday night from Abu
Dhabi of the United Arab Emirates, as part of a tour of Arab Gulf
countries that has taken him to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, Arafat's adviser Nabil Abu-Rudeina told
reporters in Abu Dhabi that Arafat's talks with UAE, Omani and
Saudi leaders were aimed to lobby Arab support for the "Palestinian
negotiators who are fighting a fierce battle of talks with Israel."
</P>

The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks in the Israeli resort city

<HEADLINE> No Policy Change over "Armenian Genocide": Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Israel told the Turkish Foreign
Ministry that there was no policy change on its side over the so-
called Armenian genocide, saying that it is up to historians, not
politicians, to discuss the issue, Turkish Daily News reported on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Turkey summoned Israeli Charge d'Affaires Moshe Kamhi last
Tuesday and demanded clarification of Israeli Education Minister
Yossi Sarid's statement that accounts of this alleged incident
should be included into Israel's high-school curriculum.
</P>
<P>
Armenians regard killings of their compatriots by Turks during
World War I as a systematic genocide, but Turkey claims that they
were the "unfortunate outgrowth of deportations" intended to
prevent Armenians from assisting the invading Russian armies at
that time.
</P>
<P>
Armenia is pushing for a bill condemning Turkey and trying to
win sympathy from the world.
</P>
<P>
One day after Sarid's statement, Israeli Justice Minister Yossi
Beilin claimed that the event was a genocide and nothing else. Both
remarks created concerns on the Turkish side that a policy shift on
the issue by Israel was being signaled.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Israel had told the Turkish Foreign
Ministry that the two ministers' statements were their personal
opinions, not government policy on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Israel has declared that there was no change in its policy over
the so-called Armenian genocide, reaffirming that it still sticks
to what was expressed in 1995 that the topic should be discussed
among historians, not politicians.
</P>
<P>
Drawing attention to Turkey's help to the Jews throughout
history, an Israeli diplomat said that Israelis were aware of
Turkey's support for Jews both before and during the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
"Our relations with Turkey are strong and good. We have been
working hard to improve the already excellent relations. We have an
agenda to go ahead and strengthen bilateral relations," said the
diplomat.

<HEADLINE> Euro Zone Entry Bid Seen Weighing on Single Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The euro fell on Wednesday to yet
another record low, plummeting to below the 0.90-U.S.-dollar mark
for the first time since its inauguration.
</P>
<P>
The single currency fell to 0.8975 dollar on the London foreign
exchange market, 23 percent below its launch level on January 1
last year.
</P>
<P>
Traders here predicted that the next major support level for
the euro would be at 0.88 dollar.
</P>
<P>
Euro critics said that the ongoing concerns about the
performance of the euro zone economy had caused the further dive
of the single currency that dropped to record lows against the
Swiss franc, British pound and Swedish crown as well.
</P>
<P>
Critics also said that additional concerns about the pending
enlargement of the 15-member bloc to embrace 13 poorer east,
central and south European countries added to the devaluation of
the euro.
</P>
<P>
Greece's bid to join the 11-member euro zone club had its
negative impact, though the European Commission, the executive
body of the European Union, said on Wednesday that Greece had met
all the necessary requirements to join the euro zone.
</P>
<P>
Pedro Solbes, EU commissioner in charge of economy and monetary
affairs, told the European Parliament's economic committee on
Wednesday that Greece's bid was based on the same economic
criteria as the other 11 European Union member states that are now
in the euro zone.
</P>
<P>
The commissioner rejected criticism that Greek membership would
further drag down the euro. Solbes, however, warned that Greece is
still faced with the risk of high inflation due to its high
interest rates and its exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
The European Central Bank urged on Wednesday that Greece take
strong fiscal measures.

<HEADLINE> Greek Boy Held By Egyptian Grandfather Reunited With Parents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ATHENS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- A 20-month-old Greek boy, who was
being held by his Egyptian grandfather since last August, was
reunited with his parents in Greece Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The boy was being kept for nine months by his grandfather to
punish his daughter Cirhan Fathy, 25, for marrying a Greek
Christian, Yiannis Diamantis, 33.
</P>
<P>
After the mediation of the Greek government, the boy was
brought to Athens on a special flight from Alexandria, Egypt,
accompanied by his grandmother and Greece's General Consul
Michalis Daratzikis, and handed over to his parents.
</P>
<P>
In an announcement Wednesday, the Greek Foreign Ministry
thanked Egypt for its help in bringing about the return of the
child to his parents.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Condemns Killings in Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said that the United
States is consulting other countries on the possibility of
deploying a reaction force.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, which deploys some 11,000 peacekeepers in
Sierra Leone, said seven U.N. soldiers were killed on Tuesday and
Wednesday in fighting with rebels of the Revolutionary United
Front (RUF) and that the rebels are holding about 50 U.N. staff.
</P>
<P>
The actions by RUF are a "direct contravention" to the Lome
peace accords reached last year, Boucher said, adding that they
are "outrageous and criminal."
</P>
<P>
"The United States condemns these actions in the strongest
possible terms," Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
The killing of personnel deployed in the U.N. mission to
Sierra Leone, taking of hostages and the attempts to obstruct
disarmament are "unacceptable" and "they must cease immediately,"
he added, demanding all hostages be released unconditionally.
</P>
<P>
"What we're doing is considering ways to improve and support
the U.N. presence there and the U.N. forces there, including
consideration of some sort of reaction force capability," Boucher
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. House of Representatives Wednesday approved
an aid of 20 million U.S. dollars to help Sierra Leone recover
from a decade-long civil war.
</P>
<P>
The bill, approved by a voice vote, will need to be approved by
the Senate too.
</P>
<P>
The measure authorizes 13 million U.S. dollars for a World Bank
rebuilding fund, five million U.S. dollars to help Sierra Leone
develop a judiciary system,1.5 million to support a Truth and
Reconciliation Commission and 500,000 for the State Department to
collect data on human rights infractions.
</P>
<P>
It also requires the president to monitor the flow of arms into
Sierra Leone from neighboring states and take action, including
the suspension of foreign aid,against any country that
participates in arms trafficking.

<HEADLINE> Rio Group Starts Preparatory Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Economic development, regional integration, security, poverty
control, the position of the Group of Rio before the Summit of the
Americas, the 30th General Assembly of the Organization of
American States (OAS), and the Millennium Summit, are some of the
issues that will be discussed during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
In the opening words, Colombian Vice Foreign Minister
Clemencia Forero Ucros said that the issue of security, in
military terms, has changed and acquired a nuance of human
security.
</P>
<P>
"Human security reveals the new challenges faced by the
hemisphere and that call for the protection of individuals in
order to guarantee the fulfillment of democratic principles, civil
freedom and human rights," said the official.
</P>
<P>
As for the impact of globalization, the Vice Foreign Minister,
said that the Group of Rio member countries ought to consider the
role they will play in a global context of the economy, marked by
interdependence and unequal growth in commercial, financial,
informative and technological flows between countries on North and
South.
</P>
<P>
According to Clemencia Forero, the challenges the region has to
face justify the existence of the Group of Rio, widened and
improved, to respond to the needs and demands of the international
order.
</P>
<P>
"The group does not only exist to generate pronouncements as a
reply to specific situations -political or economical-, but to
generate spaces to arrange upon, of consultation and reflection
that allow to generate an identity, a dream, a common Latin
American idea," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
According to authorities, of a total of 19 member countries, 15
have already confirmed their participation to the meeting, which
will start on Thursday in the Palacio San Carlos, headquarters of
the Colombian Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The Group of Rio, founded in December 1986, is a Latin American
consultation and political arrange group.

<HEADLINE> Others Blamed at Start of Lockerbie Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAMP ZEIST, Netherlands, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Defense lawyers on
Wednesday blamed two Palestinian groups for the bombing of the Pan
Am Flight 103 on December 21, 1988.
</P>
<P>
The two Libyans suspected in the bombing of the New York-bound
jumbo jet pleaded not guilty at the opening of the long-awaited
trial.
</P>
<P>
They alleged that other terrorist groups and individuals were
responsible for the mid-air bombing that killed 259 people on
board and another 11 on the ground at the Scottish village of
Lockerbie.
</P>
<P>
A defense statement named Mohamed Abo Talb, a Palestinian
serving a life sentence in Sweden for earlier bombings in Denmark
and the Netherlands, as one of 10 other alleged conspirators of
the Lockerbie bombing.
</P>
<P>
The newly alleged conspirators belonged to two groups: the
Palestinian Popular Struggle Front and the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine -- General Command.
</P>
<P>
The Lockerbie trial finally went underway after 11 and a half
years. On the first day of trial, air traffic controllers were
called as first witnesses to trace the Pan Am Flight 103's path
from its departure from London Heathrow to its disappearance from
radar screens.
</P>
<P>
Libyans Abdel Basset Ali al-Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fahima
were charged with murder, conspiracy to murder and breaching the
international aircraft safety act.
</P>
<P>
A panel of three Scottish judges must finally choose between
three verdicts: guilty, not guilty and not proven. If they chose
the first verdict, the two Libyans suspected in the bombing of the
Pan Am Flight 103, would be sentenced to life and serve their term
in Scotland.
</P>
<P>
If the judges chose either of the other two verdicts, the two
Libyan accused would go free.
</P>
<P>
A three-year investigation immediately after the tragedy led to
the issuance in 1991 of an arrest warrant for Abdel Basset Ali al-
Megrahi and Lamen Khalifa Fahima.
</P>
<P>
In August 1998, the United States and Britain accepted a Libyan
offer of a trial in the Netherlands under the Scots Law and the
two accused Libyans surrendered themselves to the Dutch police in
April the following year.
</P>
<P>
The three judges plus an additional judge were appointed in
November last year. The usual Scottish court procedure has a 15-
member jury while the Lockerbie trial has no jury but has three
judges to decide the case.
</P>
<P>
On April 27 this year, the presiding judge of the Lockerbie
trial rejected a demand from prosecution to delay the start of the
trial once again.
</P>
<P>
Two delays were allowed previously both at the demand of the
defense team.
</P>
<P>
The trial is expected to last at least one year and is
estimated to cost some 3 million U.S. dollars a month.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors, after interviewing 15,000 witnesses and collecting
200,000 pieces of evidence in the biggest murder investigation in
history, were convinced that they had had the culprits.
</P>
<P>
Court officials said that the court would hold sessions almost
daily through July 28 before adjourning until August 22.

<HEADLINE> WTO Chief Hails Agreement on Mechanism to Deal With Poor Countries' Trade Concerns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Director General of the World Trade
Organization (WTO) Mike Moore has hailed an agreement to set up a
mechanism to tackle trade problems facing developing countries as
a "major step in the right direction".
</P>
<P>
Speaking here Wednesday at the end of a one-day meeting of WTO'
s General Council, Moore said, "Our wheels have been spinning for
some time, but we're now getting traction again." He was referring
to the collapse of WTO's ministerial meeting in Seattle last
December.
</P>
<P>
Under the consensus reached at Wednesday's meeting, regular
consultations on the problems developing countries will be held
among WTO's 136 members. The developing countries had made it
clear that they had difficulties in implementing accords they had
signed up to in the 1987-93 Uruguay Round and demanded that the
transition period be extended.
</P>
<P>
Moore said that another part of the package now formalized was
agreement on a framework for ensuring better access to the markets
of richer WTO powers of goods from the poorest 48 countries, the
LDCs.
</P>
<P>
But some envoys from the 29 LDCs, or least-developed countries
as defined by the United Nations, who are already members of the
WTO,said that they were not so satisfied with offers from the four
biggest trading powers, the Quad, on easing tariffs.
</P>
<P>
Moore also said that he had to recognize that the launch of a
new global trade liberalization round remained off the negotiating
table for the immediate future.

<HEADLINE> Prodi Dismisses Top Aides from Commission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- European Commission President
Romano Prodi on Wednesday dismissed two of his top aides from the
European Union's executive body.
</P>
<P>
The two dismissed commission officials were his spokesman
Ricardo Levi of Italy and Commission Secretary General Carlo
Trojan from the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Prodi explained at a press briefing that the move was aimed at
improving the efficiency of the 20-member commission.
</P>
<P>
"The modifications were designed to optimize the work of the
European Commission," said the commission president who succeeded
Jacques Santer after his commission resigned collectively last
September ensuing a scandal of mismanagement of public funds.
</P>
<P>
David O'Sullivan of Ireland was appointed to serve as the
Commission secretary general while Jonathan Faull of Britain would
serve as deputy chief spokesman of the commission.
</P>
<P>
Prodi said that he was acting not from the pressure by others
but wanted to send out a message of efficiency and the dismissal
was part of the ongoing reform of the commission.
</P>
<P>
"The changes to these sensible posts after a mere period of
eight months in office risked to be interpreted as a sign of the
weakness of Romano Prodi," said one European Union official
speaking on condition of anonymity.

<HEADLINE> FARC Announces Agrarian Reform in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This announcement was made by the leaders of RAFC, in the
jungles of San Vicente Caguon, one of the five municipalities
south of the country, that make up the buffer zone created for the
peace process. They explained that this step abides by the "law
001" of RAFC, which has announced also that it will raise taxes
and create its own judiciary.
</P>
<P>
RAFC, the biggest and oldest Colombian guerrilla organization
which has been carrying out peace talks with the government since
last October, said that it will confiscate and "equitably"
distribute lands for those peasants "willing to work."
</P>
<P>
This guerrilla group, generated a controversy last week when it
announced its "law 002" in which it says it will collect "peace
taxes" to citizens and companies with a patrimony above one
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, RAFC's leader Pedro Antonio Marin, also known as "
Manuel Marulanda" said that the organization will create its own "
judiciary" to prosecute civilians in 130 municipalities controlled
by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
In its agrarian reform law, RAFC says that it will nullify poor
peasants' debts with state banks, it will provide "cheap credits",
technical advice, and will control the prices of agricultural
basic products.
</P>
<P>
It also promises to build public works in agricultural regions
and to respect indigenous lands.
</P>
<P>
RAFC's military chief, known as "Mono Jojoy", said in a paper
released on Tuesday that his organization seeks the recognition of
full belligerence to strengthen its role in the negotiations with
the state.

<HEADLINE> IDB Finances Power Project in Panama </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American Development
Bank (IDB) announced Wednesday the approval of 59.8 million U.S.
dollars in financing to IGC/ERI Pan Am Thermal Generating Limited
to support the development, ownership, and operation of a power
project developed under Panama's new regulatory framework.
</P>
<P>
The resources will provide take-out financing to replace short-
term bridge financing and to cover a portion of sponsor's equity
to reduce costs, the Washington-based IDB said.
</P>
<P>
The project is the first approved for Panama by the IDB's
Private Sector Department. It will be regulated by a 1997 law that
promotes private sector investment in the country's electric power
sector.
</P>
<P>
The 96 megawatt plant, whose total cost is around 92 million
dollars, is powered by six Wartsila fuel oil generators and is
located in the district of La Chorrera, approximately 35
kilometers southwest of Panama City.
</P>
<P>
The IDB financing consists of a loan of 20.3 million dollars
from the bank's ordinary capital and a syndicated loan of 39.5
million dollars with funds provided by financial institutions
under subscription of participation agreements with the IDB.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Hostage Crisis Deals Serious Blow to Peace Process in Sierra Leone  By Gu Zhenqiu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Former Sierra Leonean rebels,
ignoring repeated demands and appeals from the United Nations and
the international community, killed at least seven U.N.
peacekeepers and injured several others, thus dealing a serious
blow to the fragile peace process in the West African country.
</P>
<P>
The incident, which marks a grave escalation of the crisis
between U.N. peacekeepers and the former rebel Revolutionary
United Front (RUF), coincides with the withdrawal of the Nigerian-
led West African intervention force, which is being replaced by
the U.N. peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone, known as UNAMSIL.
</P>
<P>
The crisis creates a block for UNAMSIL to carry out its
mandate authorized by the Security Council, which, under the U.N.
Charter, has the primary responsibility for the maintenance of
peace and security in the world at large.
</P>
<P>
The hostage-taking and killing of U.N. peacekeepers also mean
a flagrant violation of the Lome Peace Agreement by RUF leader
Foday Sankoh, who signed it with the Sierra Leonean Government in
July last year.
</P>
<P>
UNAMSIL, comprising peacekeeping troops, military observers
and civilian officials, was deployed in April this year to monitor
the Lome Agreement, widely accepted as the sound basis for ending
the eight-year civil war and promoting the peace process in the
nation.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone, a country of 5.3 million people, is attempting
to recover from the brutal civil war. One of UNAMSIL's main tasks
is to oversee the disarmament and demobilization of an estimated
45,000 fighters ahead of elections planned for early 2001.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations expects to boost its peacekeeping force to
11,500 by July, making it the world's largest peacekeeping
operation. Most of the peacekeepers are from African countries.
</P>
<P>
The killings touched off strong condemnation from the
international community, including U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan and the U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Annan, who was on a visit to Cameroon Wednesday, issued a
statement here through his spokesman, expressing his "outrage at
the continuing deliberate attacks on United Nations personnel in
Sierra Leone by armed groups and individuals belonging to the
Revolutionary United Front."
</P>
<P>
Sankoh "is responsible for these actions" for "he ignored
repeated appeals by UNAMSIL to stop these attacks," the statement
said, adding that "The Secretary-General believes that all those
responsible for this unacceptable and criminal behavior,
especially leaders with authority, must be held accountable for
their actions."
</P>
<P>
Sankoh, who took up arms in 1991 and won a government seat
under the Lome Agreement, shows hostility to West African and U.N.
peacekeepers by holding up the implementation of the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Annan's statement received full support from the U.N. Security
Council, which met behind closed doors on Wednesday morning to
discuss the worsening situation in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The president of the 15-nation Council, Wang Yingfan of China,
read a statement to the press here, reiterating the Council's "
grave concern at the deterioration of the situation" in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Council members "reiterated their condemnation of the hostile
and destructive actions of the RUF against UNAMSIL and other
international personnel," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The two U.N. statements both demanded the early release of the
detainees, which rebels captured in the northern and eastern parts
of Sierra Leone, where they are carrying out their peace mandate.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations are underway to secure the early release of the
hostages while risks really exist to derail the peace process in
the West African country.

<HEADLINE> Britain Imposes Zimbabwe Arms Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Wednesday that it is
to refuse all new applications for arms and military equipment to
be exported to Zimbabwe as part of its reaction to continuing
violence in the country.
</P>
<P>
The supply of 450 British-made Land Rover cars to the
Zimbabwean police has also been put on hold until land occupations
end, Foreign Secretary Robin Cook told the House of Commons in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
"In the present circumstances of spreading violence, we have
resolved that from today Britain will refuse all new export
license applications for arms and military equipment to Zimbabwe,"
Cook said.
</P>
<P>
"This will include all licenses for spare parts in connection
with previous contracts such as Hawk aircraft. We urgently are
reviewing all existing export licenses to Zimbabwe," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cook said Britain nor any other donor would fund a program of
land reform in Zimbabwe unless it is conducted within the rule of
law.
</P>
<P>
He also insisted that any land reform program in Zimbabwe must
be based on a fair price to farmers and would also need to reduce
poverty among the rural poor who have no land.
</P>
<P>
The foreign secretary accused that the Zimbabwean government
was attempting to create a crisis over land reform in order to
secure its re-election.
</P>
<P>
Cook dismissed Zimbabwe's claims that its conditions for
funding land reform were "colonial", saying they were the
conclusions of the 1998 Land Conference hosted and chaired by the
Zimbabwe Government.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Calls for Help to Fight Livestock Diseases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Wednesday appealed to the U.N.
Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) to help fight foot and
mouth disease and the Contagious Bovine Pleural Pneumonia (CBPP)
that are threatening the animal population in the country.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister for Agriculture, Food and Fisheries Enock
Chikamba made the appeal in Nakonde on northern border with
Tanzania when he was told that the neighboring countries failed to
contain the spread of the diseases which broke out in February.
</P>
<P>
He called upon Tanzania-Malawi-Zambia Permanent Commission to
urgently meet to sort out the problem before all animals in the
border town are completely wiped out.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot continue to spend money on disease eradication while
other countries are not doing anything at all to help the
eradication of the diseases in their countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called upon government officials at border points to be
vigilant and detect where animals are being allowed to enter the
country illegally.
</P>
<P>
Senior veterinary official Obvious Kabinda said Nakonde
District has about 17,000 head of cattle out of which 5,000
animals have been vaccinated since the disease occurred in
February this year.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Plans to Treat River Blindness Patients </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Ethiopian Health Ministry
Wednesday announced a plan to offer medical treatment against
river blindness to more than three million people in the country.
</P>
<P>
The treatment against the disease is due to begin in the next
Ethiopian year that starts in September, said acting public
relations office chief with the ministry Mohammed Imano.
</P>
<P>
River blindness causes painful skin irritation and leads some
people to go blind. People living along river banks are
particularly prone to the disease, experts said.
</P>
<P>
According to Mohammed, there is a prevalence of the disease
along the Ethio-Sudanese borders as well as in some parts of the
Oromia and South Ethiopian Peoples States.
</P>
<P>
He said the Health Ministry, in collaboration with donor
agencies, was training health professionals to be deployed to the
affected areas, and preparing pharmaceuticals to be dispatched to
the localities.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said last month that it had designed a five-year
program to curb the disease at the reported areas.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Sugar Workers Object to Reduced Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, May 3 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican Sugar Workers Union
(SINTIA) is preparing a protest against the pressure from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reduce the existing
protection granted to the national sugar industry, local media
reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
SINTIA Secretary-General Alexandre Munguambe was quoted as
saying that his union is against the abolition of protection,
which takes the form of a reference price for imported sugar.
</P>
<P>
Those who import sugar that is cheaper than the reference price
have to pay the difference at the border.
</P>
<P>
Munguambe argued that the current reference price puts imported
sugar at more or less the same level with the national product for
the long period it takes to repay the investments made in the
sector.
</P>
<P>
The IMF and the World Bank forced a sharp reduction in the
protection for the Mozambican cashew industry, which has resulted
in the closure of 11 cashew processing factories with 7,000
workers losing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Munguambe said that his Union is planning to present to the
Mozambican parliament, the Prime Minister and the International
Union of Foodstuffs and Allied Workers Union a document outlining
the dangers of the IMF intentions.
</P>
<P>
He said the protest will also be taken to the European Union,
which is also believed to be pressing the Mozambican government to
abide by the IMF' s free trade dogmas.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the sugar industry enjoys protection around the
world.
</P>
<P>
The European Union subsidizes the beet sugar produced by its
farmers to the tune of about 772 U.S. dollars a ton, while the
subsidy in the U.S. is about 361 dollars a ton.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the investors in the sugar industry have
threatened that if the industry is denied protection, they will
just withdraw.
</P>
<P>
Munguambe added that the sugar industry in Mozambique currently
employs about 18,000 people, a figure that could double in the
next five years, if there is no outside interference.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique's annual sugar output is nearly 40,000 tons while
demand is about 120,000 tons.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia needs some 25 million
U.S. dollars for the implementation of the national anti-HIV/AIDS
program designed to curb the spread of the lethal disease in the
country, an official of the project said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar, coordinator of the project Etsegenet
Brehe said that the money would be collected from international
donor agencies.
</P>
<P>
According to Etsegenet, the nationwide project will mainly
focus on studying the mother-to-child transmission of HIV, the
virus that causes AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The project is also aimed at looking after children orphaned by
the killer disease, he said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that nearly 300,000 people in Ethiopia died of
AIDS related illness and three million are believed to be infected
with HIV.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures showed that nearly 10 percent of the sexually
active population aged between 15 and 49 are HIV carriers in the
country.

<P>
NAIROBI, May 3 (Xinhua) -- At least 30 armed youths engaged in
ethnic clashes in Isiolo District, Kenya's Eastern Province, were
shot dead in a security operation that ended on Tuesday night,
sources said in the capital Nairobi Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A military source disclosed that the group, which was
intercepted in the hilly Erenet area, were shot from a Kenya Army
helicopter as it drove away stolen livestock.
</P>
<P>
However, Isiolo District Commissioner John Chege said it was
difficult to establish the number of those killed as the military
personnel shot them from the air.
</P>
<P>
Chege added: "the government must protect the right to own
property at all costs and the military was called in to assist us
to recover the stolen livestock."
</P>
<P>
The Kenya army personnel Wednesday handed over recovered
livestock to the District Security Committee and elders from the
Somali community. The recovered animals, which numbered about
500, were camels, cattle and goats.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 40 people had been killed in the ethnic
clashes between Borana and Somali tribesmen near Isiolo over the
past few days although the government said only nine had died.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Seeks Release of UN Hostages in S.Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo
has sent a team to Sierra Leone in a bid to seek release of 49
United Nations peacekeepers currently held hostages by the rebels
of the war-torn west African country, said a source reaching here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister Jerry Gana was quoted as saying in the
capital Abuja that President Obasanjo has sent a five-member
delegation to Sierra Leone to negotiate an immediate release of UN
soldiers held earlier by the rebels led by Foday Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
Gana said the Nigerian delegation would use diplomatic means to
ensure the unconditional release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria led a west African intervention force that halted
Sierra Leone's civil war and restored its president Ahmad Tejan
kabbah to power in 1997 after he was ousted by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, UN officials said at lease seven UN peacekeepers had
been killed by the rebels, who were at present holding up hostage
of 49 UN soldiers and many other civilians.
</P>
<P>
The Economic Community of West African States, in a statement
in Abuja, also demanded the immediate and unconditional release of
UN peacekeepers, saying their abduction violated a peace agreement
signed last year between the Sierra Leonean government and the
rebels.

<TEXT>

<P>
BERLIN, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Although the Euro's rate against the
dollar had been down to the historical record low on Wednesday,
the German government didn't mind it.
</P>
<P>
The European Central Bank was issuing a record low reference
rate of 0.8913 dollars for the euro. One euro was still worth 0.
9116 dollars on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The German government's view is that we see this with a great
deal of calm," said German Chancellor's spokesman Uwe-Karsten Heye.
</P>
<P>
The German government is confident of that euro as the common
currency would recover based on euro bloc's fundamental economic
strengths.
</P>
<P>
"The strength and economic power of the euro nations will, in
the short or long term, lead to a strengthening (of the euro)...in
comparison to the dollar," said Heye.
</P>
<P>
The Euro as the common currency of the European Union's
members started to be put into effect on January 1, 1999 and from
then on it has fallen by nearly 23 percent against the dollar.

"The two leaders also discussed Russian President Vladimir

<HEADLINE> U.S. Regulators Approve CBS-Viacom Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- U.S. federal regulators approved
Wednesday the CBS-Viacom merger, paving the way for the two media
companies to merge their extensive interests in television, movies,
radio and outdoor advertising.
</P>
<P>
The action by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) gives
the companies one year to shed some TV stations to comply with
rules that limit the percentage of national audience one company
may reach through its own stations.
</P>
<P>
The companies also would have a year to comply with another FCC
rule that bans one entity from owning two networks. Under their
deal, the companies would have CBS and the fledgling UPN network,
which Viacom owns.
</P>
<P>
The companies would hold onto the UPN network during the one-
year period.
</P>
<P>
The FCC also is reviewing the dual network ban, and it could be
relaxed by the time the companies had to comply with the agency's
rule.
</P>
<P>
Regulators gave the merged company six months to abide by rules
that limit how many television and radio stations one company can
own in the same market. The agency ruled that in five markets the
combined company would exceed the caps.
</P>
<P>
The FCC's approval is the final step in the process. The
Justice Department already determined that the deal did not raise
any antitrust concerns.
</P>
<P>
The deal, originally valued at 36 billion U.S. dollars, gives
CBS a television and film studio to provide shows for its network.
Viacom gains major advertising outlets to promote the films and
shows produced by Paramount and its Spelling Entertainment TV
studio.

<HEADLINE> Four U.S. Senior Officials Urge Passage of PNTR Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Four Cabinet members of the
Clinton administration testified together Wednesday at a Congress
hearing in an intensified government effort to push normal trade
relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, Commerce Secretary
William Daley, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glikman and Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky called on Congress to grant
China permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) status so that the
country could benefit from the trade deal reached with China last
year.
</P>
<P>
Treasure Secretary Summers told the House Ways and Means
Committee that the coming vote on the PNTR bill is the most
important vote that the Congress will take this year.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the passage of PNTR is enormously in our
national economic interest," Summers said.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glikman, who recently visited China
with a Congress delegation, said passage of PNTR bill could mean 1.
6 billion dollars to 2 billion dollars more a year for U.S.
farmers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Commerce Secretary Daley announced that to enforce
the trade agreement signed between the U.S. and China last year,
the U.S. will put in place a new rapid response team on China,
including a dozen compliance and trade specialists.
</P>
<P>
The proposal would include a new position of deputy assistant
secretary for China at the Commerce Department to head up the
compliance team.
</P>
<P>
"This administration intends to vigorously monitor and
aggressively enforce the terms of this agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Barshefsky, who led the trade negotiations with China, said
that from the perspective of trade and economic policy, the choice
before the committee and before the Congress is "absolutely
straightforward".
</P>
<P>
"This agreement with China will open China's markets, a market
that will be the largest single market in the world, to the full
range of American exports of industrial goods, farm products, and
services to a degree unprecedented in the modern era," she said.
</P>
<P>
"The only question raised by PNTR is whether we will receive
the benefits of China's accession to the WTO, whether we will
receive the benefits of the agreement we negotiated, or will we
have opened the Chinese market for the rest of the world's
producers while our farmers and our workers and our ranchers are
left behind," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said that to deny PNTR would severely damage American trade
interests.
</P>
<P>
The hearing is held three weeks before a pivotal Congress vote
on whether to grant China PNTR status.
</P>
<P>
Republican Representative Bill Archer, who chaired the hearing,
said that the appearance of four cabinet officials at the hearing

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment to Grow in Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Based upon the good economic
indicator since the beginning of the year, the Brazilian Society
of Study on Business and Economic Globalization, forecasts a
growth in foreign direct investments in the country for this year
and next year also.
</P>
<P>
In its last bulletin released on Wednesday, the Society
forecasts investments amounting to 25 billion US dollars this year,
3 billions above February's estimates.
</P>
<P>
"During the first quarter alone, Brazil received nearly 7
billion US dollars," said the Society, justifying the new forecast.
For next year, estimates grew from 18 billion US dollars to 20
billions.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, reserve forecasts were moved down for these two
years. According to the new estimates, for the 2000-2001 period,
liquid reserves should amount to 33 billion US dollars, as
compared to prior estimates that set it in the order of between 37
to 38 billions.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of the gross domestic product (GDP) also
increased, going from 2.8 to 3.5 percent in 2000, and 3.4 to 4.5
percent in 2001. The Society forecasts a positive commercial
balance of 3 billion US dollars for the year 2000, and of 4.5
billion US dollars in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The bulletin shows that the United States was the best foreign
investor in Brazil, with 8.3 billion US dollars, 28.39 percent of
the total in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The second place went to Spain, with 5.7 billion US dollars, 20
percent of the total, followed by Portugal with 2.6 billion US
dollars, 9.2 percent of the total.

<HEADLINE> Four Senior U.S. Officials Urge Passage of PNTR Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Four Cabinet members of the
Clinton administration testified together Wednesday at a Congress
hearing in an intensified government effort to push normal trade
relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, Commerce Secretary
William Daley, Agriculture Secretary Dan Glikman and Trade
Representative Charlene Barshefsky called on Congress to grant
China permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) status so that the
country could benefit from the trade deal reached with China last
year.
</P>
<P>
Treasure Secretary Summers told the House Ways and Means
Committee that the coming vote on the PNTR bill is the most
important vote that the Congress will take this year.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that the passage of PNTR is enormously in our
national economic interest," Summers said.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glikman, who recently visited China
with a Congress delegation, said passage of PNTR bill could mean 1.
6 billion dollars to 2 billion dollars more a year for U.S.
farmers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Commerce Secretary Daley announced that to enforce
the trade agreement signed between the U.S. and China last year,
the U.S. will put in place a new rapid response team on China,
including a dozen compliance and trade specialists.
</P>
<P>
The proposal would include a new position of deputy assistant
secretary for China at the Commerce Department to head up the
compliance team.
</P>
<P>
"This administration intends to vigorously monitor and
aggressively enforce the terms of this agreement," he said.
</P>
<P>
Barshefsky, who led the trade negotiations with China, said
that from the perspective of trade and economic policy, the choice
before the committee and before the Congress is "absolutely
straightforward".
</P>
<P>
"This agreement with China will open China's markets, a market
that will be the largest single market in the world, to the full
range of American exports of industrial goods, farm products, and
services to a degree unprecedented in the modern era," she said.
</P>
<P>
"The only question raised by PNTR is whether we will receive
the benefits of China's accession to the WTO, whether we will
receive the benefits of the agreement we negotiated, or will we
have opened the Chinese market for the rest of the world's
producers while our farmers and our workers and our ranchers are
left behind," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said that to deny PNTR would severely damage American trade
interests.
</P>
<P>
The hearing is held three weeks before a pivotal Congress vote
on whether to grant China PNTR status.
</P>
<P>
Republican Representative Bill Archer, who chaired the hearing,
said that the appearance of four cabinet officials at the hearing
at one time demonstrated the importance and significance of the
PNTR issue.

<HEADLINE> Mercosur Economic Forum to Take Place in Brazil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Known as "little Davos", referring to the yearly meeting at
Davos, Switzerland, the economic summit of the Southern Common
Market (Mercosur) will deal with issues related to the main
challenges of the regional block in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Macroeconomic convergence and coordination between Brazil and
Argentina, whose basic principles were signed last week at Buenos
Aires, are some of the issues that will be covered at the debate,
for they will serve as the base of harmonization of Mercosur's
member countries.
</P>
<P>
Environment, new economy, education and competitiveness are
some other issues that will also be part of the discussions of the
event, which will be over next Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Also, the Economic Summit of Mercosur will be a good
opportunity to discuss future negotiations between the South
American block and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
President of Brazil Fernando Henrique Cardoso has already
confirmed his participation during the opening event. The program
of the summit will be released next Thursday by the Coordinator of
the Economic Summit of Mercosur 2000, Pedro Ralda in a press

<HEADLINE> Britain Backs Croatia's NATO and EU Goal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Wednesday that it
would support Croatia for its goal of an early entry into a
regional alliance with NATO and for a start to talks on an
association agreement with the European Union.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in London with visiting Croatian Prime Minister
Ivica Racan, British Prime Minister Tony Blair "gave his full
support" to Croatia's aspirations, a spokesman for Blair told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Racan arrived in London on Wednesday as part of a diplomatic
campaign to persuade European leaders that his government has
embraced democratic reforms.
</P>
<P>
During the talks with Blair, held at the House of Commons, the
Croatian prime Minster said he expected Croatia to gain admission
to NATO's Partnership for Peace (PfP) as early as this month.
</P>
<P>
"Racan set out Croatia's aspirations for admission to
Partnership for Peace and opening of negotiations on a
stabilization and association agreement with the European Union,"
the Downing Street spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister gave his full support," he said, adding
that Blair told Racan the European Union and NATO must help
Croatia "move forward".

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Stocks Fall In Second Consecutive Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 3 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks fell sharply in
the second consecutive session Wednesday as the latest data showed
rising inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 250.99 or 2.3 percent at
10,480.13, extending its loss of 80.66 points Tuesday. The blue
chip index fell as much as 331 points in intraday trading.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The technology heavy
Nasdaq composite index fell 78.14, or 2.1 percent at 3,707.31 and
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index fell 31.19 at 1,415.10.
</P>
<P>
Stocks fell as the Commerce Department reported that new orders
to American factories rose a bigger-than-expected 2.2 percent in
March due to largest jump in demand for electronic equipment in
more than two years. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve Board said in
a separate report that shortage of workers persisted in all areas,
which could lead to future wage and price increases.
</P>
<P>
Investors believed the two reports would prompt the Federal
Reserve to raise interest rates again in a pre-emptive move to
keep inflation at bay. The Board has raised rates five times since
last June and more rates hike is expected to come at the board's
monetary policy meeting on May 16.
</P>
<P>
A cautious earnings outlook also dragged the market lower today.
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette fell a day after the company warned that its
earnings in year 2000 will be lower than the previous estimates.
AT&AMP;T continued to fall on the similar warning made Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index fell 13.84 at 631.91 and the American Stock
Exchange index fell 11.32 at 914.40. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies fell 9.79 at 495.56.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-2 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 2,154 down, 844 up and 442
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 986.10 million shares from 1.01 billion
in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Agrees to Increase Special Education Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The federal government will provide about 40 percent of the
extra costs needed to give children with special needs access to
education if the bill is approved in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
The 1975 law requiring schools to educate children with
disabilities allows the federal government to contribute up to 40
percent of those costs, but it has never come close to that amount,
shifting the cost burden to the states and local school districts.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has argued that priority in
education spending should go to hiring more teachers, reducing
class sizes and rebuilding old and inadequate school structures.
</P>
<P>
However, Republicans have countered in the annual budget
battles that full federal financial support for special education
would free up states and local school districts to fund other
pressing education needs, including more teachers and new
buildings.
