	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Labor Part leader Kim Beazley on
Saturday bemoaned the fact that a series of major sports events
have overshadowed the campaign to the Oct. 3 national election.
	   Beazley said it had been ``very difficult to sell the message''
as an opposition party during a campaign dominated by the
Commonwealth Games, in which Aussie athletes collected dozens of
medals, and this weekend's football and rugby league season finals.
	   The all-Aussie final of the U.S. Open tennis tournament, between
Pat Rafter and Mark Philoppoussis also provided a distraction.
	   ``If the Australian people are substantially distracted that's
hard for us ... but we didn't pick the (election) date,'' Beazley
told reporters while campaigning in Melbourne.
	   Beazley said although Saturday was a day for people ``to forget
about politics and enjoy the football, it was difficult for (him)
to follow suit.''
	   ``I'm not capable of that. I am politics, I am 100 percent
focused on political life,'' he said.
	   Campaigning will be suspended Saturday afternoon while Beazley
and Prime Minister John Howard both attend the grand final.
	   A live crowd of 100,000 and many more television viewers are
expected to watch the Adelaide Crows defend their title against
challengers North Melbourne in the Australian Football League grand
final in Melbourne.

Unemployment on rise in Vietnam, Asian firms fire workers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Unemployment has risen by more than one
percent in Vietnam this year, putting a brake on social and
economic development, the official Vietnam News Agency reported
Saturday.
	   Unemployment has risen to an estimated 7 percent of the labor
force of 38 million people, from 6.1 percent in 1997, the agency
said. Economists say the unemployment figure is higher than
officially reported.
	   The jobless rate is greater in major cities and industrial
areas. The agency said it was 8.4 percent in Hanoi, 8.6 percent in
Ho Chi Minh City, 8.1 percent in the northern port city of Hai
Phong.
	   VNA said some 30 percent of the country's 27.8 million farmers
were underemployed.
	   Vietnam has suffered from the impact of Asia's economic crisis,
with a drop in foreign investment and trade blunting the country's
formerly healthy economic growth.
	   Faced by severe problems at home, companies with investment from
Southeast Asia, South Korea and Taiwan have fired some 30,000
workers so far this year, VNA said.
	   The news agency said 10 percent of construction workers have
lost their jobs this year, while 30 percent of workers in the
leather, shoes, textile and garment industries have been laid off.
	   To ease the unemployment pressure, the government in July
approved a national unemployment program with the target of
creating five million new jobs by the year 2000.
	   The government said that dlrs 343 million from the state budget,
foreign aid and other sources will be spent to create the new jobs.

Kuala Lumpur braces for more protests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The Malaysian capital on Saturday
braced for more anti-government protests scheduled at three mosques
in the heart of the city.
	   Hundreds of leaflets announcing the protest were distributed at
Friday's weekly prayer at the city's National Mosque that turned
into a rally in support of ousted deputy prime minister, Anwar
Ibrahim.
	   Police put up roadblocks and diverted traffic in some areas
around the mosques early Saturday but did not seal off the area
where the demonstrations were likely to be held, eyewitnesses said.
	   Such protests, until recently unheard of in Malaysia, are fast
becoming routine. They started after Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad fired his deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, on Sept. 2 and escalated
after his arrest Sunday under a security provision.
	   Mahathir said he could not tolerate Anwar's immoral behavior and
homosexuality. Anwar denies the police charges against him and says
his only fault has been to challenge Mahathir's 17-year-reign.
	   Soon after Anwar's arrest, police ordered his wife to stop
making public statements or face the same fate as her husband.
Malaysians face arrest for organizing pro-reform protests.
	   At least 16 people, many of them governing party members who
backed Anwar, are in jail under the Internal Security Act, a
British colonial law that allows for imprisonment without trial.
	   Three men were detained by riot police who charged into
Malaysia's biggest mosque Friday to chase demonstrators shouting
slogans against Mahathir.
	   The three were arrested for throwing stones at the police,
Ghazali Mohd Amin, a police spokesman, said Friday night.
	   Anwar has not been seen by even his family and lawyers since he
was marched off by masked riot policemen on Sunday. Repeated
requests for information about the 51-year-old politician have
elicited no response from the police.
	   Since Monday, a battery of his defense lawyers and dozens of
reporters and television crew have waited daily at Kuala Lumpur's
courthouse in case the police decided to bring Anwar there.
	   Under the ISA, the police are not obliged to produce him before
a magistrate for two months, but expectations had been heightened
by Mahathir's statement that Anwar would be given a fair and open
trial.
	   But on Friday, Mahathir said Anwar would be brought to court
when the protests stopped.
	   ``If he will tell his followers not to riot, he will be brought
to court for trial,'' Mahathir told reporters.

The NATO allies walk down a new strategic road in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 16th graf to restore first reference to Cohen &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT WIELAARD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VILAMOURA, Portugal (AP) _ For the first time, the NATO allies
plan to take the offensive, readying bombers, missiles and warships
to strike at a European neighbor that, at best, poses a vague
threat to them.
	   The Kosovo crisis has dragged them into something new: they are
publicly planning for hostilities, rather than reacting to them.
	   During 45 Cold War years, NATO never said it would not be the
first to strike. Nor did it say it would be. It kept Moscow at bay
with the threat of massive retaliation to any attack, a strategy
that worked so well the allies were able to reap a huge ``peace
dividend'' when the Berlin Wall fell in 1989.
	   ``But that dividend has been paid out,'' Dutch Defense Minister
Frank de Grave said Friday after a two-day NATO defense ministers
meeting.
	   ``NATO cannot go on endlessly cashing in that dividend. The
world has not become a safer place. We still must invest in our
security.''
	   Against that backdrop, the allies are preparing for air strikes
on Yugoslavia unless President Slobodan Milosevic ends his attacks
on ethnic Albanians struggling for independence in Kosovo. If
necessary, NATO says it will attack with missiles and bombs,
gradually intensifying the assault until Milosevic halts his
offensive in Kosovo.
	   After months of contingency planning, NATO knows its way around
Yugoslavia. For one thing, sources say, military planners have
identified 600 surface-to-air missile sites across the country that
would be targeted and knocked out along with their command and
control centers.
	   Although allied air strikes helped end the Bosnian war, Kosovo
is different.
	   ``What we are really talking about here is a humanitarian
disaster precipitated by the cold political calculus of an
autocratic leader who has pursued a political strategy by military
means against his own citizens,'' said Gen. Wesley K. Clark,
supreme allied commander in Europe.
	   In Bosnia, NATO was a partner of the United Nations which passed
36 Security Council resolutions aimed at achieving peace.
	   NATO could have cited a half dozen of the resolutions to justify
military action, particularly to retaliate for Bosnian Serb attacks
against U.N. ``safe havens'' and to protect international
peacekeepers.
	   Milosevic threatens no NATO troops or U.N. peacekeepers and
considers Kosovo an internal matter. To him, the province was
Serbia's heartland in the Middle Ages and an integral part of the
Serbian state since the Serbs regained independence from the Turks
in 1878.
	   How then can NATO justify attacking a sovereign country that
does not threaten it?
	   The United States and Germany lead a camp that argues that by
bombing his own subjects, making almost 300,000 of them homeless
and turning hundreds of villages into ghost towns, Milosevic
undermines stability on NATO's eastern doorstep.
	   An allied attack, they say, is about defending Western values
and interests and NATO needs no formal approval for that from the
United Nations.
	   ``The United States believes that no authority from the Security
Council is necessary,'' U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen told
reporters here. ``The credibility of NATO is on the line.''

Kuala Lumpur braces for more protests

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Amnesty statement

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The Malaysian capital on Saturday
braced for more anti-government protests scheduled at three mosques
in the heart of the city.
	   Meanwhile, an international human rights group demanded
immediate release of all political prisoners held in the recent
crackdown.
	   Hundreds of leaflets announcing the protest were distributed at
Friday's weekly prayer at the city's National Mosque that turned
into a rally in support of ousted deputy prime minister, Anwar
Ibrahim.
	   Police put up roadblocks and diverted traffic in some areas

Malaysians face arrest for organizing pro-reform protests.
	   At least 16 people, many of them governing party members who
backed Anwar, are in jail under the Internal Security Act, a
British colonial law that allows for imprisonment without trial.
	   The London-based human rights group, Amnesty International,
Saturday labeled Anwar and the others detained under ISA as
``prisoners of conscience.''
	   Amnesty said it was concerned ``that all the men are at risk of
ill-treatment _ including aggressive, prolonged interrogation
techniques previous ISA detainees have suffered _ while held in
incommunicado detention.''
	   ``By misusing Malaysia's laws to detain his political opponents,
Prime Minister Mahathir is contravening international legal
standards,'' the Amnesty statement said.
	   Three men were detained by riot police who charged into
Malaysia's biggest mosque Friday to chase demonstrators shouting
slogans against Mahathir.
	   The three were arrested for throwing stones at the police,

	   ARECIBO, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Practically nothing is working on
Cristobal Colon street, a rubble-strewn lane in this north coast
city that was submerged a few days ago under six foot (two-meter)
floodwaters from Hurricane Georges.
	   Nothing except the U.S. postal service.
	   As haggard residents struggled on Friday through their fourth
day without water or electricity, postman Carlos Cancel donned a
crisp blue regulation shorts set and a white safari hat, and
delivered the mail.
	   Given the chaos all around, it was an act of near heroic
civility.
	   The waters have now subsided, leaving Arecibo's sidewalks
clogged by piles of mudcaked clothing and waterlogged appliances
put out to dry in the stifling heat.
	   Carlos Gonzalez stood guard outside his battered home in bathing
trunks and flip-flop sandals, clutching a flyswatter. ``I've killed
about a hundred,'' he bragged.
	   Down at the corner, men and children turned a fire hydrant into
a playful public bath house.
	   Others approached with shopping carts, stocking plastic jugfulls
of the gushing _ and possibly drinkable _ water,
	   Hit Monday, Puerto Rico was an early stop along Hurricane
George's punishing sojourn through the Caribbean _ a journey that
killed at least 300 people, sent tens of thousands more to
shelters, and destroyed vast swaths of agriculture in already-poor
countries.
	   In Puerto Rico, where four were killed and damages reached dlrs
2 billion, water and power remained cut off for most of the 3.8
million residents Friday, although some service was restored in the
capital.
	   President Bill Clinton declared the U.S. territory a disaster
area, making it eligible for hundreds of millions of dollars in
aid.
	   But here and in many other areas reeling from flash flooding and
whipping hurricane winds, storm victims say help has not yet
arrived.
	   ``We'll take anything they decide to give us,'' said Jose
Crespo, whose family is living off food from the Salvation Army and
sleeping in a shack above his demolished one-story home.
	   Crespo, 50, complained that damage assessors from the Federal
Emergency Management Agency _ the U.S. agency channeling much of
the relief _ had not even visited the storm-wracked neighborhood.
	   ``They've got two guys making (claims) checks on about 500
people,'' he said.
	   Irene Montigo, who spent two sleepless nights on the floor of a
government shelter when swelling rivers destroyed her house, said
she's seen no signs of relief.
	   The only real solution for the people here, said Montoya, was to
move to higher ground. ``I'm going elsewhere, ``she said. ``There's
just no way to live here.''

	   NORTH CHARLESTON, South Carolina (AP) _ Professional and
Olympic-eligible skaters, including 1998 silver medalist Michelle
Kwan, squared off Friday night in interpretive freestyle programs,
competing for a dlrs 40,000 top prize in the First Union Grand Slam
of Skating.
	   Sixteen skaters were invited to the competition, sanctioned by
the International Skating Union, and eight advanced to Saturday's
semifinals.
	   The skaters, who were limited to three jumps, were scored by
seven international judges on a scale of 1-to-6 on technique and
presentation.
	   ``It's a little bit awkward, but it's easier because you don't
have to do a jump and a jump and a jump,'' Kwan said of the format.
``It gives you more time to expand artistically, more time to
express how you feel and more time to get your point across.''
	   Other women advancing were Maria Butyrskaya of Russia; Lu Chen
of China, a former world champion and two-time Olympic bronze
medalist; and Yuka Sato of Japan.
	   Former world champion Kurt Browning of Canada also liked the
setup and the competition.
	   ``It makes it easier to present a better program,'' he said.
``This is an experiment, and it is important that this is a
success.''
	   Todd Eldredge of the United States, another former world
champion; 1998 Olympic gold medalist Ilia Kulik of Russia; and
Evgeny Plushenko of Russia also advanced.
	   The four women and four men will go head to head Saturday, with
the top two of each group advancing to the final round.
	   After the Grand Slam of Skating, the eligible skaters remain
qualified for the Olympics and the world championships.
	   ``This is the first time we are doing it, and we are confident
it will work,'' ISU president Ottavio Cinquanta said. ``It's
important because the big names of the ice skating world will be
together in competition.''
	   Other women who competed Friday were Irina Slutskaya of Russia,
a world silver medalist; Josee Chouinard of Canada; and Americans
Nicole Bobek and Caryn Kadavy.
	   The other male competitors were Viktor Petrenko of Ukraine, the
1992 Olympic champion; Scott Davis, a two-time U.S. champion;
Takeshi Honda of Japan; and Eric Millot of France.

Kiribati patrol ship fires on South Korean tuna vessel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A Vietnamese crewman was killed when a
Kiribati patrol ship fired on a South Korean tuna boat in waters
off the central Pacific island republic, officials said Saturday.
	   Nguyien Van Sinh, 21, died while being transported to hospital
Friday, Foreign Ministry officials said. The rest of the 26-man
crew of the Dongwon No. 617 were detained in the Kiribati island of
Canton near the equator.
	   The 400-ton ship was operating near Canton when the patrol ship
ordered it to stop for questioning early Friday, the officials
said.
	   When it continued to sail, the patrol ship opened fire, they
said.
	   ``We are protesting to the Kiribati government that the vessel
was operating legally and the shooting was unwarranted,'' said Nam
Ki-ho, a ministry official.
	   The tuna vessel was owned by South Korea's Dongwon Industry Co.,
which produces canned tuna and other fisheries goods.

Philippine president says Cathay Pacific willing to take over PAL

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with union offering not to strike for 10 years in
10th-11th grafs

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Cathay Pacific is willing to take
over management of closed Philippine Airlines if its shutdown
becomes permanent, President Joseph Estrada said Saturday.
	   Estrada said executives of Hong Kong-based Cathay Pacific have
also agreed to bring five Airbus planes to the Philippines starting
Monday to help service some of PAL's former domestic routes.
	   In Hong Kong, Cathay Pacific said the flights would be operated
on a charter basis. Foreign airlines have been prohibited from
regularly operating Philippine domestic routes.
	   ``We are pleased to be able to help maintain aviation service
around the Philippines during this difficult time,'' Cathay Pacific
chief operating officer Philip Chen said in a statement.
	   PAL's closure last Wednesday left many areas of the sprawling
Philippine archipelago without air service, and Estrada has been
attempting to fill that gap.
	   Speaking in a radio interview, Estrada said Cathay Pacific was
``also prepared to manage Philippine Airlines if it finally
closes,'' but gave no further details. Under Philippine law, a
majority of the airline's ownership would have to remain in
Filipino hands.
	   Chen said Cathay Pacific's ``initial focus is on providing
sufficient charter capacity, it is too early to talk about what
developments may occur beyond that.''
	   Estrada said three planes would also be leased from PAL, which
had been flying 11 planes domestically before its shutdown.
	   PAL shut after its largest union refused to accept a
management-proposed rehabilitation plan in which workers would have
received 20 percent of the airline's stock in exchange for a
10-year suspension of their collective bargaining agreement.
	   Union leaders continued to reject that plan, but offered
Saturday not to strike for 10 years and to accept cuts in various
benefits if current grievance machinery is maintained.
	   ``We affirm our commitment to cooperate with PAL management,''
the ground crew union said.
	   A committee formed by Manila's Securities and Exchange
Commission is also studying whether there is any chance of
reopening the carrier, which has been unable to make payments on
dlrs 2.1 billion in debts to domestic and international creditors.
	   Both PAL and Cathay Pacific have been hit hard by Asia's
currency crisis, which has reduced passenger volumes. PAL had
launched a dlrs 4 billion modernization and refleeting program
shortly before the crisis hit.
	   The Philippine flag carrier also was badly hurt by labor
disputes, including a 25-day pilots' strike in June.
	   Four other smaller domestic carriers are also hoping to fill
some of the void left by PAL's closure, but have been troubled by
safety violations and financial woes.
	   On Saturday, workers from Grand Air passed out flyers at
Manila's airport to announce its return to the air after being shut
down for a week because of unpaid insurance bills, employees said.

Kiribati patrol ship fires on South Korean tuna vessel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS time element to Thursday, 2-3 grafs

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A Vietnamese crewman was killed when a
Kiribati patrol ship fired on a South Korean tuna boat in waters
off the central Pacific island republic, officials said Saturday.
	   Nguyien Van Sinh, 21, died while being transported to hospital
Thursday, Foreign Ministry officials said. The rest of the 26-man
crew of the Dongwon No. 617 were detained in the Kiribati island of
Canton near the equator.
	   The 400-ton ship was operating near Canton when the patrol ship
ordered it to stop for questioning early Thursday, the officials
said.
	   When it continued to sail, the patrol ship opened fire, they
said.
	   ``We are protesting to the Kiribati government that the vessel
was operating legally and the shooting was unwarranted,'' said Nam
Ki-ho, a ministry official.
	   The tuna vessel was owned by South Korea's Dongwon Industry Co.,
which produces canned tuna and other fisheries goods.

Astros beat Cubs 6-2
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS late games; UPDATES wild-card standings throughout &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ Neither Sammy Sosa nor the Chicago Cubs wound up
with the lead Friday night.
	   Sosa hit his 66th home run, leaving him tied with Mark McGwire,
but the Cubs failed to take advantage and lost to the Houston
Astros 6-2. The loss left Chicago tied for the NL wild-card lead
with the New York Mets and San Francisco Giants.
	   The Mets lost to Atlanta 6-5, while San Francisco beat Colorado
8-6. All three teams in the wild-card chase have two games left.
	   Sosa temporarily gained the lead in the home run race when he
hit a 462-foot drive leading off the fourth inning. About 45
minutes later, however, McGwire hit his 66th in St. Louis' game
against Montreal.
	   Sosa homered off friend and fellow Dominican Jose Lima, who also
gave up Nos. 50 and 51 to the Chicago slugger at Wrigley Field on
Aug. 23.
 &UR; Cardinals 6, Expos 5 &QC; 
	   In St. Louis, Mark McGwire hit No. 66, a two-run shot in the
fifth inning off Shayne Bennett.
	   Rookie J.D. Drew had a pair of two-run homers for the Cardinals,
who have won 10 of 12 to guarantee a winning record.
	   When Sosa took the lead in the home run derby for only the
second time all season at Houston, it prompted a collective groan
from a sellout crowd at Busch Stadium and booing when Sosa's home
run number was changed on the scoreboard.
	   But McGwire brought back the cheers when he hit a 1-2 pitch
about 375 feet into the left-field stands. It was the 21st time
that McGwire and Sosa homered on the same day.
 &UR; Braves 6, Mets 5 &QC; 
	   In Atlanta, New York twice left the bases loaded and stranded 12
runners overall in the loss to Atlanta, which left the Mets tied
with Chicago and San Francisco for the wild-card lead.
	   Andruw Jones and Keith Lockhart homered for Atlanta, which tied
a franchise record with its 104th win and secured the home-field
advantage throughout the league playoffs.
	   The Mets pulled within a run in the ninth on Carlos Baerga's RBI
groundout against Atlanta stopper Kerry Ligtenberg. But with the
tying run at third, John Rocker came on to strike out pinch-hitter
Todd Pratt for his second save.
 &UR; Giants 8, Rockies 6 &QC; 
	   In Denver, The streaking San Francisco Giants pulled into a
three-way tie for the NL wild-card lead, beating the Colorado
Rockies behind Rich Aurilia's four hits and two RBIs.
	   San Francisco, five games behind Chicago in the wild-card chase
just eight days ago, got its fifth straight win and eighth in its
last nine games.
	   Aurilia went 4-for-5 and scored two runs. San Francisco had 15
hits, only one of them for extra bases, and drew eight walks.
	   Colorado's Larry Walker, the NL's leading hitter, struck out
pinch-hitting in the eighth, and his average fell to .359. His
closest pursuer, New York's John Olerud, went 1-for-3 and remained
at .351 with two games remaining.
 &UR; Reds 4, Pirates 1 &QC; 
	   In Cincinnati, Bret Boone and Brook Fordyce homered and Jason
Bere pitched into the eighth inning as Cincinnati beat Pittsburgh
for the first time in their last six meetings.
	   Bere (3-2) allowed five hits over 7 1-3 innings, sending the
Pirates to their first loss in Cincinnati this season.
	   Danny Graves relieved and got a double-play grounder to finish
the eighth, then gave up a solo homer to Kevin Young with one out
in the ninth.
 &UR; Diamondbacks 6, Padres 3 &QC; 
	   In Phoenix, Yamil Benitez hit a three-run, pinch-hit homer with
one out in the ninth inning to lift Arizona over San Diego.
	   San Diego had scored a run to tie it at 3 in the the top of the
ninth.
	   In the bottom half, Randy Myers (1-3) struck out leadoff batter
Karim Garcia, but Garcia made it safely to first on a wild pitch.
Garcia advanced on Kelly Stinnett's sacrifice bunt, then David
Dellucci walked on four pitches.
	   Benitez hit Myers' 1-0 pitch 422 feet into the stands in left
field for his ninth homer of the season.
 &UR; Dodgers 3, Brewers 2 &QC; 
	   In Los Angeles, Ismael Valdes pitched eight strong innings and
Mark Grudzielanek hit a two-run homer as the Los Angeles Dodgers
beat the Milwaukee Brewers.
	   Valdes (11-10), who missed more than a month of the season
because of a strained stomach muscle, allowed an unearned run and
six hits with five strikeouts and four walks.
	   Jeff Shaw gave up an RBI single to Jeromy Burnitz in the ninth
before finishing for his 47th save.

	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Shunned by Western governments and
investors for its heavy-handed practices, Slovakia may be headed
for a striking change after two-day national elections end
Saturday.
	   Opposition leaders reiterated their predictions of victory
Friday after a strong initial voter turnout in the Central European
nation. All 150 seats in Parliament are at stake.
	   Vladimir Meciar, the authoritarian prime minister whose ruling
party topped the last pre-election opinion polls says he will not
lead a minority government and has hinted at the possibility of
defeat in recent days.
	   ``Meciar has no chance to put together a majority coalition,''
Grigorij Meseznikov, an analyst at the institute for Public
Affairs, an independent Bratislava think tank, said Friday. ``The
opposition parties are certain to win a majority, and it appears
they are determined to work together in a new government.''
	   Human rights groups and the opposition have warned that the
government might meddle with the election in order to stay in
power. But two Austrian observers for the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe, which has over 200 election monitors
present, voiced satisfaction with Friday's voting. Johannes
Voggenhuber told the Austria Press Agency it was ``surprisingly
well-organized.''
	   From the Danube River in the southwest to the rugged High Tatra
Mountains in the east, Slovak voters seem enthusiastic about the
vote _ the second since the country became independent from the
former Czechoslovakia in January 1993.
	   Pensioners, businessmen and mothers with small children in tow
flocked to polling stations in the capital Bratislava, a bustling
old industrial city where featureless concrete buildings from
communist times mingle with more graceful architecture from its
days in the Austro-Hungarian empire.
	   Pensioner Ludmila Mariaova, 74, said she voted for Meciar's
ruling party because she trusted him. ``Nobody else appreciates
those of us who have put in four years of hard work,'' she said
outside a Bratislava polling station Friday.
	   But many younger, more urban Slovaks back the opposition and are
fed up with the policies of the ruling party, which they perceive
as anti-democratic and benefiting the owners of Slovakia's newly
privatized industries.
	   Six of 17 competing parties are likely to get the required 5
percent minimum needed to gain seats in Parliament. Only the Slovak
National Party, an extreme-rightist group whose billboards proclaim
it is ``for a Slovakia without parasites'' _ a slur against
minority ethnic Hungarians and Gypsies _ says it would ally with
Meciar's party.
	   The other four parties are from the opposition, led by the
Slovak Democratic Coalition. Its leader, 43-year-old Mikulas
Dzurinda, is the likely opposition choice to become prime minister.
	   ``We will stick together. If there are problems, we are going to
stay together, because we will always remember the bad times under
Meciar,'' he said earlier this week.

Labor opposition bemoans campaign being overshadowed by sports
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORECTS name of `Philippoussis' in 3rd graf. &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Australia-Election

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Labor Party leader Kim Beazley on
Saturday bemoaned the fact that a series of major sports events
have overshadowed the campaign to the Oct. 3 national election.
	   Beazley said it had been ``very difficult to sell the message''
as an opposition party during a campaign dominated by the
Commonwealth Games, in which Aussie athletes collected dozens of
medals, and this weekend's football and rugby league season finals.
	   The all-Aussie final of the U.S. Open tennis tournament, between
Pat Rafter and Mark Philippoussis also provided a distraction.
	   ``If the Australian people are substantially distracted that's
hard for us ... but we didn't pick the (election) date,'' Beazley
told reporters while campaigning in Melbourne.
	   Beazley said although Saturday was a day for people ``to forget
about politics and enjoy the football, it was difficult for (him)
to follow suit.''
	   ``I'm not capable of that. I am politics, I am 100 percent
focused on political life,'' he said.
	   Campaigning will be suspended Saturday afternoon while Beazley
and Prime Minister John Howard both attend the grand final.
	   A live crowd of 100,000 and many more television viewers are
expected to watch the Adelaide Crows defend their title against
challengers North Melbourne in the Australian Football League grand
final in Melbourne.

Scarsella replaces Hill as Soccer Australia boss
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Basil Scarsella was named Saturday to
replace David Hill as chairman of Soccer Australia.
	   ``We need to become financially stable, win success with our
four national sides and overhaul our administration,'' Scarsella
said.
	   He also confirmed that Raul Blanco and Les Scheinflug would
continue as caretaker coaches for the national teams for the
immediate future with Sept. 1999 the earliest date for appointment
of a new coach.
	   Terry Venables coached the team during its failed campaign to
qualify for the recent World Cup. He has since resigned to take a
job with English club Crystal Palace.
	   Hill resigned to concentrate on an election campaign in next
month's federal poll.

Trade Minister attacks Japanese banks as ``bloody hopeless''
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COFFS HARBOUR, Australia (AP) _ Trade and Deputy Prime Minister
Tim Fischer on Saturday blamed ``bloody hopeless'' Japanese banks
for much of the current international economic strife.
	   Australia had learned from the banking debacles after the Wall
Street crash of October 1997 and the economy is now well placed to
weather another severe correction on Wall Street if it occurred
next month, he said.
	   ``The world economic difficulties result from a range of
reasons, not the least of which is the bloody hopeless banking
arrangements associated with a country as big as Japan, our biggest
trading partner,'' Fischer told reporters.
	   ``They still have not got it right in 1998.''
	   He said the collapse of the State Bank of South Australia and
the absorption of the Victorian State Bank into the Commonwealth
Bank had been learning experiences for Australia.
	   ``Australia is, because of its balanced budget delivered by the
(conservative) coalition ... well placed to weather whatever comes
out of the Wall Street volatility,'' he said.

Cabinet official's daughter abducted, released unharmed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Armed men abducted the daughter of
Agrarian Reform Secretary Horacio Morales and released her unharmed
with a warning that they would harm his family if he continues to
distribute land to poor farmers, Morales said Saturday.
	   President Joseph Estrada said he has ordered the police to hunt
down those responsible.
	   Estrada said authorities suspect the mastermind to be a big
landlord with a private army who has refused inclusion of his
property under a government land reform program.
	   Morales said his youngest daughter, Karina, 17, was on her way
to his birthday party on Sept. 14 when she was abducted in front of
a suburban shopping mall.
	   The gunmen blindfolded her in a car and let her go two hours
later ``to relay the message that they would harm me or other
members of my family if I was not `careful','' Morales said.
	   He said the gunmen stole her daughter's money so she could not
immediately call for help. He added that he did not immediately
disclose the abduction because he needed time to arrange security
for his family.
	   His daughter quoted one of the abductors saying: ``Our boss does
not like what is happening at the Department of Agrarian Reform.
Tell your father, land is important to us.''
	   Morales condemned his daughter's abduction, saying it was a
``cowardly act.''
	   ``They could have moved against me, their real target, but
didn't,'' he said. ``Instead, they chose an innocent, defenseless
child to try to scare me.''
	   Morales, a former communist underground leader, said the threat
will fail, adding that killing him won't stop the government's
agrarian reform program.

Labor opposition bemoans campaign being overshadowed by sports
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS name of `Philippoussis' in 3rd graf &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Australia-Election

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Labor Party leader Kim Beazley on
Saturday bemoaned the fact that a series of major sports events
have overshadowed the campaign for the Oct. 3 national election.
	   Beazley said it had been ``very difficult to sell the message''
as the nation's attention turned to the Commonwealth Games, in
which Australian athletes collected dozens of medals, and this
weekend's football and rugby league season finals.
	   The all-Australian men's final of the U.S. Open tennis
tournament, between Pat Rafter and Mark Philippoussis, also
provided a distraction.
	   ``If the Australian people are substantially distracted that's
hard for us ... but we didn't pick the (election) date,'' Beazley
told reporters while campaigning in Melbourne.
	   Beazley said although Saturday was a day for people ``to forget
about politics and enjoy the football, it was difficult for (him)
to follow suit.''
	   ``I'm not capable of that. I am politics, I am 100 percent
focused on political life,'' he said.
	   Campaigning will be suspended Saturday afternoon while Beazley
and Prime Minister John Howard both attend the football grand
final.
	   A live crowd of 100,000 and many more television viewers are
expected to watch the Adelaide Crows defend their title against
challengers North Melbourne in the Australian Football League grand
final in Melbourne.

Cambodian king says he cannot lift travel ban for government critic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ King Norodom Sihanouk said Saturday
he could not protect an outspoken government critic who has been
singled out by Cambodian leader Hun Sen as a possible target for
arrest.
	   Opposition politician Khem Sokha was banned from leaving the
country after playing a leading role in anti-government protests
calling for the ouster of Hun Sen.
	   Hun Sen accused the leaders of the rallies of provoking a Sept.
7 grenade attack on his Phnom Penh residence.
	   The opposition has claimed the attack, which resulted in no
injuries, was staged by Hun Sen as an excuse to break up the
demonstrations.
	   ``I have tried my best to help you, but now I have no ability to
help you anymore,'' Sihanouk said in a letter to Khem Sokha after
he asked the monarch to intervene on his behalf.
	   Khem Sokha, who has been stopped twice this month from boarding
international air flights, said Saturday that he was unsure why he
is being barred from leaving the country.
	   He speculated that it stems from his past criticisms of the
government's human rights record.
	   Speaking by telephone from a safe house in the capital where he
has stayed since police began watching his home and family, the
former chairman of the National Assembly's human rights commission
said he believed he was being singled out because he no longer
enjoys parliamentary immunity.
	   ``I don't have any power now,'' said Khem Sokha, whose party
failed to win any seats in parliament in the July 26 elections.
``If they accuse me of doing something wrong I cannot do
anything.''
	   Political tensions have reached a boiling point since the Sept.
7 attack on Hun Sen's home. Police violently cracked down on
demonstrators after the incident, killing at least four and
severely beating dozens others.
	   On Thursday, a rocket-propelled grenade exploded near Hun Sen's
motorcade as he was driving to the new parliament's swearing-in
ceremony. Hun Sen escaped injury, but a 12-year-old boy sitting
along the road was killed.
	   Hun Sen immediately accused the opposition of being behind the
failed plot.
	   Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party and the two opposition
parties in parliament are set to begin negotiations next week to
form the next government.
	   A spokesman for the opposition party led by former Finance
Minister Sam Rainsy said Saturday that Khem Sokha's inability to
leave the country could be interpreted as a pressuring tactic.
	   ``It's muscle-flexing and sabre-rattling,'' the spokesman said.
``It's also a violation of Khem Sokha's constitutional right...of
freedom to travel.''
	   Opposition party leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy
flew to Bangkok on Friday after the travel ban was lifted for them.
They are scheduled to return Monday.

 &UR; Report: Anwar's children bear the brunt of investigation

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The children of jailed ex-Deputy
Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim are bearing the brunt of the police
action against him, a newspaper reported Saturday.
	   One of Anwar's daughters has refused to go to school after being
harassed by other students, the Sun newspaper said quoting Anwar's
wife, Azizah Ismail.
	   Since Anwar's arrest Sunday, his five daughters and one son have
lived under siege with dozens of policemen patrolling outside to
ensure that Azizah does not organize any rallies for political
reform.
	   ``One daughter was told by her teacher to ignore all questions
from her peers while another said she is being constantly bombarded
with questions from her friends,'' Azizah, 46, said.
	   Anwar, 51, was arrested under a security provision, but faces
accusations ranging from homosexuality to treason. Sordid details
of Anwar's alleged sex acts have been disclosed by Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad and many local papers have published explicit
accounts.
	   Another daughter, Nurul Ilham, 11, was so sick after Anwar's
arrest that she had to be rushed to hospital for treatment.
	   ``She misses her father very much and has been sick since he was
arrested,'' Azizah said. ``She hardly eats at all.''
	   Neither Azizah nor any of the children have seen or heard from
Anwar since he was marched off by masked riot policemen from the
family's home in Damansara Heights.
	   Requests by Anwar's lawyers for information have been ignored by
the police.

Barcelona, Buenos Aires bid for World Cup
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Either Spain or Argentina will host
the 2001 Rugby World Cup Sevens, Rugby World Cup Limited chairman
Leo Williams said Saturday.
	   He said the final decision will be made next month.
	   Twelve countries had initially indicated interest in hosting the
RWC Sevens and this had been pared down to six finalists.
	   With Japan, Portugal, Canada and Ireland now out of the running,
this left the choice between a southern hemisphere tournament in
Buenos Aires in October, 2001, or Barcelona in June, 2001.
	   Williams said RWC Sevens was an ideal tournament for those
emerging rugby nations not yet competitive in the 15-a-side game,
and interest was high.
	   ``I expect 100 nations to play off to get into the Sevens,''
Williams said.
	   He said about 60 nations competed for the 1997 RWC Sevens in
Hong Kong, which was won by Fiji.
	   Sevens made its debut at the Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur
this month and was well supported.

Solitude at sea, and plenty of it
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BRUCE SMITH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CHARLESTON, South Carolina (AP) _ After years of planning,
raising money and testing their yachts, 16 skippers set sail this
weekend in a renewal of the 27,000-mile (43,450-kilometer) Around
Alone single-handed yachting race.
	   ``It's wonderful to be just flying on the boat,'' said Isabelle
Autissier of France, the only female in the field. ``I really like
the balance between long periods at sea and pushing the boat.''
	   Robin Davie said Friday he just couldn't think of anything
better to do than spending eight months alone at sea.
	   ``It's a great escape from reality,'' said the race veteran who
will skipper a 49-foot (15-meters) yacht named South Carolina.
	   ``I'm doing it for the money,'' laughed J.P. Mouligne, a
Frenchman who lives in Rhode Island. ``I was told you could get
rich in this business. But it was like the movie Casablanca. I was
misinformed.''
	   The race, previously known as the BOC Challenge, has been held
every four years since 1982. Its starting point moved from Newport,
Rhode Island, to Charleston in 1994.
	   Colorful flags on the yachts slapped in a brisk breeze as school
children and tourists walked along the docks at the Charleston
Maritime Center. A handful of sailors had their yachts in the
harbor, doing some last-minute minute testing before the race start
at noon today.
	   The course takes the sailors around the world with stops in Cape
Town, South Africa; Auckland, New Zealand; and Punta del Este,
Uruguay, before returning next spring.
	   Thirty-nine skippers originally registered, although only 16
will be starting, four fewer than four years ago.
	   Some dropped out because they could not raise enough money.
Others ran into equipment problems and one contestant was booted
because he wanted to name his boat for a cigarette sponsor and
refused to make a 2,000-mile (3200-kilometer) qualifying sail.
	   Christophe Auguin of France, who won the past two races, is not
back to defend his title in Class I _ boats between 51 and 60 feet
(15 to 17 meters). There are seven Class I competitors, while the
rest of the field will compete in Class II, which includes yachts
between 40 and 50 feet long (12 to 15 meters).
	   ``It's a very special race, a very human race,'' said Giovanni
Soldini of Italy, who placed second in Class II four years ago and
has moved up to the larger class. ``This is the second time and
we'll see if we are there a third.''
	   Some skippers seemed a bit awed by what they have undertaken.
	   ``At the time it was a good idea,'' Canadian Sebastian Reidl
said. ``I went to bed last night and was thinking about it and I'm
not so sure.''
	   But he said the race in his 60-foot (17-meter) yacht Project
Amazon is a challenge and ``for once in my life, I would like to be
among the best in the world.''
	   Russian Fedor Konioukhov, who has climbed Mount Everest and is
the first Russian to reach the North Pole alone, was preparing for
his third solo around-the-world sail when he heard about the race
and decided to enter.
	   Neal Petersen, a South African who has lived in Charleston since
competing four years ago, said the Around Alone is all about
setting goals and reaching them.
	   ``In my mind, there are no barriers,'' said Peterson, who gives
inspirational talks to school and corporate groups and whose yacht
is named www.no-barriers.com. ``This race is a tremendous risk. You
make a mistake, you die.''

Greeks find Clinton woes tame
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Excuse the Greeks if they yawn a bit at
the Starr report.
	   They're not so easily jolted anymore. Those days ended years ago
with a home-grown political sex scandal that makes the independent
counsel's account seem staid.
	   ``It's like the difference between a hot tango and a proper
waltz,'' said Panos Psaris, a student reading a magazine piece
about the showdown between Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr and
President Bill Clinton.
	   Forget the stains, cigars and steamy phone calls. The Greek
spectacle included a bickering first family, an elderly premier
given the nickname ``Ironman'' and enough nude photos of his young
mistress to fill a scrapbook.
	   The affair by the late Premier Andreas Papandreou has become a
kind of badge of honor for Greeks. They remind themselves they were
watching high-level lust and betrayal while Monica Lewinsky was
still in high school.
	   ``Seem familiar?'' asked a commentary in the daily Avriani
newspaper, which has published dozens of compromising photos of
Papandreou's mistress-turned-wife-turned-widow, Dimitra Liani, over
the past decade. Ms. Liani is naked, topless or cavorting with
other men in many of the shots.
	   Papandreou's affair with the former flight attendant tore apart
his 38-year marriage to his American-born wife, Margarita, and
opened huge rifts with his children. It also cast him in dual roles
among the public: lauded as an icon of Greek virility or scorned as
an embarrassing symbol of macho self-indulgence.
	   But there were enough critics to cost Papandreou and his
Socialists the 1989 election after eight years in power. He won
re-election in 1993 and died three years later at age 77.
	   His widow has since flirted with the idea of entering politics.
	   Ms. Liani and Papandreou's children also battled over ownership
of a family house sold by the premier to build the luxurious
multimillion-dollar Pink Villa.
	   Justice Minister Evangelos Yannopoulos _ once one of
Papandreou's most loyal allies _ was apparently annoyed that
Clinton's troubles led to comparisons with Papandreou. He let loose
Tuesday in a vicious tirade against Starr.
	   ``Democratic people around the world should rise up so that the
new McCarthyism does not pass,'' Yannopoulos said, insisting that
he would never allow such a sexual inquest in Greece.
	   The Washington-watching took a sharp domestic turn with the
distribution of a ``Dear Hillary'' letter by Margarita Papandreou.
The letter, written as a personal correspondence to first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton, shares her thoughts about Papandreou's
affair.
	   ``I feel immensely close to you,'' Ms. Papandreou wrote in the
letter, which first appeared Sept. 20 in the Detroit Free Press.
``I know the ache, the tears, the sleepless nights, the
disbelief.''
	   Ms. Papandreou was both hailed and harangued. Some commentators
accused her of taking a cheap shot at her husband's memory.

<TEXT>
	   In Seattle, the Texas Rangers clinched their second AL West
crown in three years despite a drubbing by the Seattle Mariners,
winning the division when second-place Anaheim lost to Oakland.
	   The Rangers had a four-game winning streak broken. But they
reached the AL playoffs when the Angels fell 7-2 to the Athletics.
	   Texas players shook hands and exchanged hugs when they came off
the field at the end of the eighth inning, right after the Angels'
result became final.
	   Ken Griffey Jr. matched his career-high home run total of 56 _
set last season _ and drove in five runs for the Mariners. Griffey
leads the AL in homers; Sammy Sosa of the Chicago Cubs and St.
Louis' Mark McGwire each hit their 66th homers earlier in the
evening.
	   Joe Oliver and Ryan Radmanovich also homered for the Mariners.
Lee Stevens hit two home runs for Texas.
	   The Rangers' opponent in the first round is still uncertain.
They could play either New York or wild-card winner Boston.
	   Paul Abbott (3-1) was the winner. Esteban Loaiza (3-6) went
three-plus innings, allowing six runs on six hits and a walk.
 &UR; Athletics 7, Angels 2
	   In Oakland, The Anaheim Angels handed the AL West title to the
Texas Rangers with a loss to the Oakland Athletics,
	   The Angels, who led the division by 3 1/2 games on Sept. 6 and
had at least a share of first place every day from Aug. 14 to Sept.
16, eliminated themselves from contention with the loss to the A's
while the Rangers were playing at Seattle.
	   Kenny Rogers (16-8) threw a seven-hitter to become the first AL
pitcher since at least 1951 to go undefeated at home for an entire
season while recording at least 10 decisions. Records before 1951
were not available.
	   Rogers went 11-0 with a 1.96 ERA at home in his first season in
Oakland. Five NL pitchers have gone undefeated at home since 1951,
the most recent being Philadelphia's Tommy Green in 1993.
	   Omar Olivares (9-9) took the loss.

Sosa hits No. 66, McGwire strikes back

 &UR; EDS: UPDATES with results of game.

<TEXT>
	   HOUSTON (AP) _ Sammy Sosa has been the lone single-season home
run king for a grand total of 1 hour, 52 minutes over two
short-lived stints. Each time he grabs the record, Mark McGwire
answers right back.
	   Disappointed? Nah.
	   ``Disappointed for what, man?'' Sosa asked. ``Mark is my friend,
not my enemy.''
	   About 45 minutes after Sosa hit his 66th homer Friday night,
McGwire answered with his 66th in St. Louis to tie for the major
league record.
	   The scenario played out similarly Aug. 19, when Sosa took the
lead with No. 48 in St. Louis only to watch McGwire tie him 57
minutes later. McGwire then retook the lead with another homer in
that game.
	   Sosa's 462-shot against Houston in the fourth inning couldn't
keep his Chicago Cubs from losing 6-2 and failing to gain an edge
in the tight National League wild-card race.
	   The line drive into the third deck in left-center field froze
left fielder Moises Alou in his tracks and sent a near-capacity
Astrodome crowd into a flashbulb-peppered frenzy.
	   The crowd also cheered when the park's giant screens showed
McGwire hit his record-tying homer off Montreal's Shayne Bennett.
	   It was Sosa's third homer of the year off friend and fellow
Dominican Jose Lima, who served up Nos. 50 and 51 at Wrigley Field
on Aug. 23. Milwaukee's Cal Eldred is the only other member of
Sosa's triple-homer club.
	   ``I think he was looking for that pitch inside,'' Lima said.
``We had pitched him inside the first time around, so he was
expecting it. It was a fastball, and it was a good pitch. I tip my
hat to him.''
	   Sosa insists he wasn't looking for anything in particular and
just liked the looks of Lima's 0-1 offering as it came to him. Both
players again denied a previously published report that Lima might
have grooved a pitch for Sosa in August to give his pal a boost.
	   Lima also gave up a homer to McGwire this season.
	   Sosa broke out of an 0-for-21 slump Wednesday with two homers at
Milwaukee to tie McGwire at 65. Both players have two scheduled
games remaining, though Sosa could get some extra swings if the
Cubs finish in a wild-card tie.
	   The Cubs, New York Mets and San Francisco Giants are tied in the
race for the NL wild-card berth with two games remaining.
	   If the Cubs end tied with one or both, they'll play a playoff
either Monday or Tuesday that counts as a regular-season game,
giving Sosa one last chance to add to his tally.
	   ``I don't know how we're going to finish,'' Sosa said. ``But the
way things look, we have a lot of chances to make it. We have to
come back (today) and win, then think about the other games.''
	   The fan who caught Sosa's 66th in the rarely reached Astrodome
loge section chose to keep the ball and declined to identify
himself to a Cubs representative. He reportedly left his seat soon
afterward.

McGwire hits No. 66, ties Sosa
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with results of game
 &UR; By R.B. FALLSTROM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Take that, Sammy. Again.
	   Forty-five minutes after Sammy Sosa took the major league homer
lead with No. 66, Mark McGwire answered with his 66th. His two-run,
fifth-inning shot in St. Louis' 6-5 victory over Montreal on Friday
night re-tied the home run derby with just two games to go.
	   Although McGwire said yet again that he didn't care who wins,
his manager would be crushed if McGwire didn't finish on top.
	   ``As far as I'm concerned, Mark's home run chase is the most
important thing the next two days,'' Tony La Russa said. ``We're
pulling for him real, real, real hard.''
	   McGwire said that was the wrong attitude.
	   ``That's just him,'' McGwire said. ``My feeling is what he and I
have done, whoever's on top nobody should be disappointed. How can
you walk away being disappointed if you walk away one below? You
can't. It's impossible.''
	   Shayne Bennett, who gave up No. 66 to McGwire, only hoped there
would be more fireworks.
	   ``I don't want to be the guy who gives up the last one,''
Bennett said. ``If Sammy hits another one, they'll forget about me.
C'mon, Sammy.''
	   Sosa led for 58 minutes on Aug. 19 before McGwire hit his 48th
and 49th homers at Chicago. Leading off the fourth at Houston, Sosa
hit No. 66 off Jose Lima, and McGwire responded with a man on and
two outs in the fifth with a 375-foot drive.
	   ``It was almost as good as 62,'' La Russa said.
	   On the first pitch from Bennett, McGwire nearly homered on a
towering drive that landed just to the left of the foul pole in the
upper deck in left field. Busch Stadium personnel inadvertently set
off fireworks.
	   ``False alarm,'' McGwire said with a grin. ``The guy was
trigger-happy.''
	   Expos manager Felipe Alou thought the foul drive was even more
impressive than the homer.
	   ``I've never seen a fly ball go that far in my life,'' Alou
said. ``And I've been in many different leagues.''
	   Rookie J.D. Drew had a pair of two-run homers for the Cardinals,
who have won 10 of 12 to guarantee a winning record. Drew, the
Cardinals' first-round draft pick, has five homers and 12 RBIs
since joining the team Sept. 8 _ the day McGwire broke Roger Maris'
record with his 62nd homer.
	   ``He's got a pretty good shot at breaking this record some
day,'' McGwire said. ``He's a lot farther along than I was at that
age. It's going to be nice to play with him for a few years.''
	   When Sosa took the lead in the home run derby, it prompted a
collective groan from a sellout crowd at Busch Stadium who booed
when Sosa's home run number was changed on the scoreboard.
	   Before connecting, McGwire had been 2-for-11 on the homestand
with a pair of singles and hadn't homered in 14 at-bats. He
extended his NL record to 161 walks on a full count in the first
and lined out to left in the third against Miguel Batista (3-6) and
singled off rookie Kirk Bullinger to lead off the seventh.
	   McGwire and Sosa each have two games left, with McGwire's at
home against the Expos and Sosa's on the road against the Astros.
McGwire faces right-hander Dustin Hermanson (14-11) today, while
Sosa faces right-hander Shane Reynolds (19-8). On Sunday, McGwire
faces Mike Thurman (4-5), and Sosa goes against Mike Hampton
(11-7).
	   McGwire has two homers against Montreal, and this was his first
since he connected off Trey Moore on April 21. Alou suspects
McGwire may hit a few more off his largely inexperienced staff.
	   ``We don't have Greg Maddux here who can pinpoint a fastball on
the corner every time,'' Alou said. ``We have kids. We have Mike
Maddux.''
	   The latest homer was No. 453 of McGwire's career, putting him in
20th place ahead of Carl Yastrzemski. He has hit 176 homers the
last three seasons.
	   In 204 career games with the Cardinals, McGwire has 90 homers,
182 RBIs and 204 walks. He has 47 homers and 95 RBIs in 104 career
games at Busch Stadium.
	   Rookie Jose Jimenez (3-0) allowed three runs in 6 1-3 innings
and Juan Acevedo finished for his 14th save.
	   Bob Henley had four hits and three RBIs for Montreal, including
a two-run double in the eighth that cut the gap to 6-5.
 &UR; Notes: &LR;  The Cardinals set an attendance record of 3,100,699 with
both remaining games also sold out. ... Bennett had allowed only
six homers in 91 innings before giving up the homers to McGwire and
Drew in the fifth. ... The Cardinals haven't permitted a homer in
87 innings since the first game of a doubleheader Sept. 15 against
Pittsburgh. ... The Cardinals lead the NL with 218 homers, six more
than Atlanta. St. Louis last won the home run title in 1944 with
100.

Adelaide beat North Melbourne in Australian Football League final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Adelaide made a remarkable second
half comeback to defend its Australian Football League title with a
35-point win over North Melbourne in the final at the MCG on
Saturday.
	   A crowd of almost 95,000, including former boxing great Muhammad
Ali, watched Adelaide climb off the ropes after North raced to a
24-point half-time lead.
	   Adelaide's Darren Jarman and Andrew McLeod starred for the
second year in a row as the Crows scored a 15.15 (105) to 8.22 (70)
victory. Jarman was the top scorer while McLeod was voted best
player in the final for the second year running.
	   North, which won its past 11 matches and was the pre-match
favorite, should have delivered a knock out by half-time but wasted
the opportunity with poor kicking. Only six of its 21 scoring shots
went through for goals but it led 51-27 at the main break.
	   North kicked a deplorable 2.11 in the second term after leading
4.4 (28) to 3.2 (20) at quarter-time.
	   ``At half-time a lot of people wouldn't have given us a chance
but the amount of belief in this team is amazing,'' said Crows'
captain Mark Bickley.
	   Adelaide came out fiercely in the third quarter, scoring the
next 24 points to draw level for the first time in the match before
Winston Abraham kicked a long range goal for North to put the side
a goal ahead.
	   But the Crows, led by 1997 final hero Jarman, went away to a
65-63 lead at the final change and skipped two goals clear early in
the final term.
	   North captain Wayne Carey, who had a magnificent season leading
up to the final, missed an easy chance to put his team within seven
points. Carey finished with 1.4.
	   The Crows responded with two quick goals. The second, from
Jarman wide out on the right, gave him a fifth for the game and put
his side four goals in front. Nigel Smart's goal with three minutes
remaining ended any faint hopes of a North revival.
	   Jarman lifted Adelaide to its first ever title last year when he
kicked six goals, including five in the last quarter, in the final
against St. Kilda.

President decides against firing government of lawless state
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's opposition were rejoicing
Saturday after the president ruled not to fire officials of Bihar
state, considered the country's most lawless.
	   The government had wanted to fire Bihar's officials on the basis
of a report by State Governor Sunder Singh Bhandari that said Bihar
was rife with of ``financial mismanagement and failure of law and
order.''
	   The governor is a member of the ruling party, but is expected to
act impartially.
	   But the decision by President K.R. Narayanan supports the
opposition's view that the eastern state is still in control.
	   Cabinet members are expected to wait for Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee's return from New York early next week before
deciding their next move.
	   Most lawmakers in the Bihar state legislature have criminal
records and have frequently been accused of switching political
loyalty in return for hefty bribes.
	   Bihar's top elected state official, Rabri Devi, has demanded the
dismissal of Gov. Bhandari.

Sanchez-Vicaro advances to final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Will be updated with second semifinal &QL; 
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Top seed Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario survived a key
game with a little luck and a spectacular retrieval Saturday and
beat Anke Huber 6-1, 3-6, 6-3, advancing to her fifth consecutive
Toyota Princess Cup final.
	   For the third year in a row, her final opponent will be Monica
Seles, a 6-1, 6-4 semifinal winner over Thailand's Tamarine
Tanasugarn. Seles, who has won the tournament four times, is
seeking her third consecutive title here. Sanchez-Vicario was the
1994 champion and then lost in the next three finals.
	   Against Huber, Sanchez-Vicario took a medical timeout to have
her right wrist taped at the end of the second set. The WTA No. 4
started the third by quickly losing her serve and falling behind
40-0 in the next game.
	   But at 40-15, Huber missed a forehand into a wide open court and
Sanchez-Vicario reached deuce on a running backhand down the line
off what looked like a winning short, sharp crosscourt.
	   Huber missed another chance with a backhand wide, and
Sanchez-Vicario finally evened the score 1-1 on her fifth break
point.
	   After Sanchez-Vicario broke again for 4-2, Huber threatened to
break back. But from 0-40, the 7th-seeded German netted three
shots, watched an ace zip past her and then netted another shot.
	   She was cited for a code violation as the threw her racket
across to the court to her sideline seat.
	   Sanchez-Vicario, the French Open champion, had to save two more
break points in the final game before winning the two-hour match on
a backhand wide by Huber _ her 11th victory in 13 meetings between
the two.
	   Starting out aggressively, Sanchez-Vicario played flawless
tennis in the first set, but Huber began to find the range with her
heavy hitting in the second set and kept the Spaniard on the
defensive.
	   In the final set's second game, ``I don't know what happened,''
Huber said. ``Everything looked like I was going to win that game
for 2-0. I wasn't aggressive enough, and she started to play
better.
	   ``It's always hard against her. ... For a couple of games (after
the timeout) she just pushed the ball back, and suddenly she was
playing normally again. It was kind of weird,'' Huber added.
	   Sanchez-Vicario said of her hitting arm: ``It was not an injury.
It just got tight.''
	   She said the balls had felt heavy all week, and she started
feeling the problem in the second set.
	   The trainer's massage on her arm and taping of the wrist
``helped me to serve better and loosen up and hit my shots
better,'' she said.
	   ``On the important points I went for my shots again like I did
in the first set,'' she added.
	   Seles, the WTA No. 6, needed just 65 minutes to beat Tamarine
here for the second consecutive year. She saved some of her best
points for the last game with some impressive volleying, a backhand
winner from a hard rally and an ace on her second match point.
	   ``Tammy has very good ground strokes. A few times, her serve let
her down,'' Seles said. ``She's a hard worker and she enjoys
tennis, and those are really good signs. I like her very much as a
person. She's very gracious.''
	   But for Sanchez-Vicario, against whom she has a 16-3 records,
Seles said, ``I'll have to play some unbelievable tennis.''
	   After a day on which a high wind played tricks on the players,
the tournament was back indoors Saturday, with the roof closed on
the Ariake Colosseum because of rain.

Three generations huddled as Georges battered Dominican Republic

<TEXT>
	   ALTOS DE CHAVON, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Three generations of
Lopez women huddled in the tiny bathroom while red tiles tore off
the roof above them and rained down on the parking lot in a
deafening crash.
	   Cruz Maria, 69, sat on the toilet. Her daughter Sandra, 39,
squeezed into the shower stall. Sandra's daughter Mariangel, 14,
sat on her grandmother's lap.
	   Hurricane Georges had reached the Dominican Republic in a
furious swirl that would kill more than 300 people in the
Caribbean. And the Lopez family was scared.
	   When the winds began at 5:30 a.m. last Tuesday, Sandra was
already awake, serving chamomile tea to an Associated Press
journalist stranded in Altos de Chavon, a wealthy seaside community
of artists on the Dominican Republic's eastern tip.
	   The television was tuned to the Weather Channel, where
forecasters told of the hurricane's devastating pass through Puerto
Rico and speculated about the destruction it caused there.
	   By 8 a.m. the winds became strong. The family rushed to secure
the doors and close the wooden shutters of the windows.
	   Cruz Maria went to shut a balcony door and slipped, injuring her
hip. She lay on the tile floor for the next 90 minutes moaning as
the winds increased outside.
	   Her daughter finally fashioned a sling out of a bedsheet and
dragged Cruz Maria into the bedroom, where she rested on a bed
while the winds became a whistle and the shutters slammed
violently.
	   Sandra rubbed ointment on her mother's back, urging her to stay
still. Cruz Maria insisted on helping secure the apartment and got
up.
	   Bending palm trees at a 45-degree angle, the howling wind began
to tear off the roof tiles and smash them into parked cars with
thumps. The shooting rain pinned leaves to the walls of their
apartment building.
	   Suddenly, around 10 a.m., everything stopped. The sun came out,
and a surreal silence descended on the complex.
	   Voices began to speak out.
	   ``Is everyone OK?'' a neighbor yelled.
	   ``Dona Luchi? Are you all right?'' Sandra asked incredulously.
	   ``We're all OK, thank God,'' came the response.
	   One by one, people ventured out of their apartments. Their
voices echoed as they wandered through the parking lot staring at
the smashed windows of their battered cars.
	   Glass shards sparkled in the alley next to the apartment
building. A six-foot 6 (two-meter) water heater had been ripped off
the roof and slammed to the ground. Broken roof tiles and shredded
leaves carpeted the pavement.
	   The lull lasted about an hour. And then, as suddenly as Georges
had disappeared, it was back. The sky darkened again, and neighbors
screamed to one another to get back inside.
	   The eye had passed _ and the worst was yet to come.
	   In a moment, the air went from dead calm to explosive fury. A
shutter in a bedroom crashed open and the palm trees groaned as
they bent again to the relentless wind.
	   The windows in the living room wobbled back and forth and part
of the roof lifted off and shattered in 10 seconds of deafening
terror.
	   Sandra shrieked, and the women fled to the only room with no
windows _ the maid's bathroom.
	   Another part of the roof fell and Cruz Maria began to murmur the
Hail Mary. The others soon joined her.
	   ``Lord, we are lucky to be here, but have mercy,'' Sandra said.
	   Mariangel began to whimper. Her grandmother held her closer.
	   The only way of knowing what was happening outside was by the
sounds, and every crack or pop led to a guessing game about what
had broken or fallen.
	   By 2 p.m., the winds slowly lessened. The banging of the
shutters became less fierce, and the shattering tiles less
frequent.
	   The women decided to venture out.
	   Through the driving rain, an unnatural darkness had settled on
Altos de Chavon, but the landscape was somehow clearer. The trees
had been stripped of their leaves and muddy, 20-foot (6-meter)
waves crashed onto the distant beach.	   The black asphalt of the parking lot was red with pieces of roof
tiles. Entire roofs had disappeared from nearby houses. Uprooted
trees and lampposts blocked the streets.
	   An inch (two centimeters) of water covered the floor of the
apartment, and more dripped down through the ceiling.
	   But Sandra insisted on setting the table for dinner. Mariangel
laid out the wicker place mats and china and lighted three candles.
She, her mother and grandmother sat down to leftover lasagna.
	   A knock at the door and Dona Luchi, the neighbor, stepped in,
dripping wet, with a pitcher of hot cocoa and marshmallows. She sat
down, and Sandra said grace.
	   ``Thank God we're safe with our loved ones,'' she said. ``All
our things may be ruined, but I'm happy to be here with my
family.''

Moore inspiration for Bulldogs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Canterbury official Peter Moore, who is
suffering cancer and effects of a stroke, will sit on the
replacements bench in Sunday's Australian Rugby League final
against Brisbane.
	   Moore built the team which heads into the match as a
considerable underdog, and has been the inspiration behind
Canterbury's rise from ninth on the table at the end of the regular
season.
	   The Bulldogs have strung together some thrilling wins, including
an extra-time victory in the semi-final against Parramatta last
week.
	   ``At the start of the series that was our aim _ to do as well as
we could for (Moore),'' said Canterbury forward Steve Price.
``We've got one game left and we want to finish on a high note. I
just think the human element will come into it more than
anything.''
	   At 2-9, Brisbane is the shortest priced favorite in final
history. Canterbury is quoted at 3-1.
	   The Bulldogs have the support of most of Sydney and are aiming
for the biggest grand final upset since Balmain stunned South
Sydney 11-2 in 1969.
	   But most pundits expect them to struggle against a Brisbane team
which goes into the game with 13 wins from its past 14 matches.
	   ``No-one expects us to win except the true believers and the
guys closely involved,'' admitted Canterbury coach Steve Folkes.
	   Both teams trained behind closed doors Saturday and neither
reported any injury concerns.

Jospin says Sino-French `dialogue' on human rights working
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: WILL be updated with Jospin speech in Hong Kong, scheduled to
begin at 0900 GMT.

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said
Saturday that France's ``constructive dialogue'' with China has led
to improved human rights.
	   China won a round in its struggle with human rights critics when
President Jacques Chirac said in May 1997 that France wanted a
civil dialogue and called on European governments to treat Beijing
with ``equality and mutual respect.''
	   Jospin, speaking to a gathering of French business leaders and
Shanghai academics, said that approach was working. He discussed
human rights in a meeting Thursday with Prime Minister Zhu Rongji.
	   ``The numerous Franco-Chinese exchanges in the field of the
condition of rights represents today a substantial chapter in our
bilateral cooperation,'' said Jospin, who was ending a three-day
visit to China.
	   ``They are built on the political plan by the Franco-Chinese
`constructive dialogue' on human rights that France forcefully
contributed to putting in place,'' he said, adding that the
discussions have already yielded ``appreciable results.''
	   Jospin pointed to the recent unprecedented visit by Mary
Robinson, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, and China's
reforms of its court system and gradual steps toward adopting
international judicial standards.
	   Those signs of progress aside, Chinese police continued a
clampdown on democracy campaigners during Jospin's visit. At least
four dissidents have been taken into custody since Wednesday, the
eve of his arrival, although two have been released.
	   Jospin spoke at the new Shanghai Grand Theatre, a sleek
structure designed by French architect Jean-Marie Charpentier, who
was on hand along with members of Jospin's Cabinet.
	   The prime minister visited a French-language public school
program in Shanghai, where Chinese students asked questions in
French.
	   After taking more questions in French from Chinese audience
members at the Grand Theater, Jospin marveled at their skill in the
language, the second most-common foreign tongue in Shanghai after
English.
	   ``I'm going to go home and say all the Shanghainese speak
French,'' he said to laughter from the audience.
	   Jospin planned to leave later Saturday for Hong Kong, where he
was to address a business conference.
	   On Friday, Jospin met President Jiang Zemin in Hefei, capital of
the eastern province of Anhui, where the Chinese leader was
inspecting flood-recovery efforts.
	   Sino-French relations have improved steadily since a rift two
years ago, when Paris irritated Beijing by selling Mirage fighter
jets to rival Taiwan.
	   On Thursday, the two governments signed agreements on developing
information technology and financial cooperation, while on the
sidelines of the meetings French businesses sealed 14 deals worth
2.8 billion yuan (dlrs 339 million or 1.9 billion francs).

Chinese police jail dissident for setting up opposition party
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Chinese police plan to keep a democracy
campaigner in custody for at least 15 days for trying to set up an
opposition political party, a rights group reported Saturday.
	   Police in eastern Shandong province notified Xie Wanjun's family
on Thursday that he was being held under a 15-day detention order
for passing information on the China Democracy Party, the
Information Center for Human Rights and Democratic Movement said.
	   The notification was the latest evidence leaders in the ruling
Communist Party plan to ban the would-be opposition party outright.
Dissidents have tried to register the party since June, hoping to
crack a 49-year prohibition against opposition politics.
	   In the past two weeks, police have detained at least a dozen
dissidents often for short periods of time. Most of those taken
have connections to the China Democracy Party.
	   Xie was detained on Monday. Two days later police took away
fellow Shandong democracy campaigner Li Lianjun, but his family has
yet to receive word on his case, the Hong Kong-based Information
Center said.
	   Two other dissidents detained Thursday in central Wuhan city
have been released, the group said. China Democracy Party agitator
Chen Zhonghe was let go the same day but police did not return
4,000 yuan (dlrs 480) he had collected from other dissidents for
victims of summer floods.
	   Likewise, the Information Center said police did not return the
facsimile machine and 2,000 pages of documents they confiscated
from the home of veteran human rights campaigner Qin Yongmin. Qin
was released Friday.
	   The Information Center also reported that 27 dissidents in
eastern Zhejiang have petitioned Chinese President Jiang Zemin to
take steps towards political liberalization.
	   Specifically, the dissidents demanded a halt to political
detentions, a full account for the military crackdown on the
Tiananmen Square democracy movement in 1989, freedom for the media,
an independent judiciary and elimination of laws that conflict with
the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights _ a U.N.
treaty China plans to sign next month.
	   Many of the petition's signatories were detained in July in the
first crackdown against China Democracy Party supporters.

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Shunned by Western governments and
investors for its heavy-handed practices, Slovakia may be headed
for a striking change after two-day national elections end
Saturday.
	   Opposition leaders reiterated their predictions of victory on
Friday after a strong initial voter turnout in the Central European
nation. All 150 seats in Parliament are at stake.
	   Vladimir Meciar, the authoritarian prime minister whose ruling
party topped the last pre-election opinion polls says he will not
lead a minority government and has hinted at the possibility of
defeat in recent days.
	   ``Meciar has no chance to put together a majority coalition,''
Grigorij Meseznikov, an analyst at the Institute for Public
Affairs, an independent Bratislava think tank, said Friday. ``The
opposition parties are certain to win a majority, and it appears
they are determined to work together in a new government.''
	   Human rights groups and the opposition have warned that the
government might meddle with the election in order to stay in
power. But two Austrian observers for the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe, which has over 200 election monitors
present, voiced satisfaction with Friday's voting. Johannes
Voggenhuber told the Austria Press Agency it was ``surprisingly
well-organized.''
	   Slovak election officials said Saturday the voting was going
smoothly with no significant problems nationwide.
	   From the Danube River in the southwest to the rugged High Tatra
Mountains in the east, Slovak voters seem enthusiastic about the
vote _ the second since the country became independent from the
former Czechoslovakia in January 1993.
	   Pensioners, businessmen and mothers with small children in tow
flocked to polling stations in the capital Bratislava, a bustling
old industrial city where featureless concrete buildings from
communist times mingle with more graceful architecture from its
days in the Austro-Hungarian empire.
	   Pensioner Ludmila Mariaova, 74, said she voted for Meciar's
ruling party because she trusted him. ``Nobody else appreciates
those of us who have put in four years of hard work,'' she said
outside a Bratislava polling station Friday.
	   But many younger, more urban Slovaks back the opposition and are
fed up with the policies of the ruling party, which they perceive
as anti-democratic and benefiting the owners of Slovakia's newly
privatized industries.
	   Six of 17 competing parties are likely to get the required 5
percent minimum needed to gain seats in Parliament. Only the Slovak
National Party, an extreme-rightist group whose billboards proclaim
it is ``for a Slovakia without parasites'' _ a slur against
minority ethnic Hungarians and Gypsies _ says it would ally with
Meciar's party.
	   The other four parties are from the opposition, led by the
Slovak Democratic Coalition. Its leader, 43-year-old Mikulas
Dzurinda, is the likely opposition choice to become prime minister.
	   ``We will stick together. If there are problems, we are going to
stay together, because we will always remember the bad times under
Meciar,'' he said earlier this week.

Bangladesh to host nine-nation cricket tournament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CALCUTTA, India (AP) _ With flood waters receding, Bangladesh
will host a 9-nation limited overs cricket tournament beginning
next month as scheduled, an International Cricket Council official
said Saturday.
	   ``We are monitoring the post-flood situation in Bangladesh and
the situation is certainly improving,'' said Jagmohan Dalmiya, the
ICC president, in Calcutta, the capital of West Bengal state.
	   Nealy 70 percent of Dhaka, the Bangladesh capital, was flooded
in July-August by the heaviest monsoon rains in decades.
	   India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Australia, West Indies, England,
South Africa, New Zealand and Zimbabwe will participate in the
tournament beginning Oct.24. The final will be played on Nov.2.
	   The day-night matches will be limited to 50 overs each and will
be played at the Bangabandu National Stadium in Dhaka.
	   The total prize money will be dlrs 400,000, with the winner and
runner-up getting dlrs 100,000 and dlrs 60,000 respectively,
Dalmiya said.

Shokhin says finance minister's appointment a mistake
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN IAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The deputy prime minister who quit over the naming
of Mikhail Zadornov as finance minister said on Saturday the
appointment was a political mistake.
	   Alexander Shokhin, who was deputy prime minister in charge of
economic policy, quit Friday after President Boris Yeltsin
announced the appointment of Zadornov, a holdover finance minister
who served in the previous two administrations.
	   ``By reappointing the man responsible for the collapse of the
financial system, (Prime Minister Yevgeny) Primakov has assumed
responsibility for the previous financial policy,'' Shokhin told a
news conference.
	   The appointment was ``a political mistake,'' he said.
	   Shokhin said he was appointed deputy prime minister only to
serve as ``window dressing for the West'' and that ``from the very
beginning I was not meant to influence the government's policy
seriously''
	   Zadornov, a 35-year-old economist, is seen as a minister who is
fully committed to market-oriented economic reforms. But, he also
presided over Russia's decision to devalue the ruble and
effectively default on its loans last month.
	   Shokhin, appointed on Sept. 15, previously had served as
economics minister at the start of Russia's post-Soviet market
reforms.
	   He was Russia's liaison to Western lenders, said after his
resignation that he had no intention of remaining as a ``fig leaf''
for investors when the Russian government is ``occupied by people
who have already deceived investors once.''
	   Russia's economic difficulties were highlighted earlier Friday
when a team from the International Monetary Fund left Moscow
without recommending the next installment of a dlrs 22.6 billion
loan package at the end of the month.
	   The IMF said the team would return on Oct. 12 for additional
negotiations _ a postponement that was disappointing to Russian
officials, if not entirely unexpected.
	   The IMF has stressed in recent weeks that it expects to see
signs of an enduring commitment to market-oriented economic reforms
before it agrees to release any more of the money it promised
Russia in July.
	   The new government continued to take shape Friday, with Yeltsin
announcing 10 Cabinet-level appointments, including that of
Zadornov. Yeltsin has now appointed 20 Cabinet members, leaving 10
positions to be filled.
	   Yeltsin dismissed the previous government headed by Sergei
Kiriyenko as the economy began to unravel last month, saying the
country needed a more experienced leader to shepherd it through the
crisis.

Police cordon off Kuala Lumpur's Independence Square
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with riot police deployment
 &UR; AP Photos Available
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Hundreds of riot police cordoned
off the capital's historic Independence Square Saturday to head off
antigovernment protests by supporters of ousted deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   All roads leading to the Merdeka Square, where Malaysia's
independence from British colonialists was proclaimed in 1957, were
blocked off by the police. Dozens of police trucks and buses filled
with armed security personnel were parked nearby.
	   Pro-democracy activists scheduled protests at three mosques
nearby in the heart of the city. Police feared that activists would
march to the square to repeat last Sunday's mammoth rally after
which Anwar was arrested.
	   Shopkeepers pulled down their shutters in some adjoining areas
in anticipation of violence as the police moved in.
	   Hundreds of leaflets announcing the protest were distributed at
Friday's weekly prayer at the city's National Mosque that turned
into a rally.
	   Such protests, until recently unheard of in Malaysia, are fast
becoming routine. They started after Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad fired Anwar on Sept. 2 and escalated after his arrest under
a security provision.
	   Mahathir said he could not tolerate Anwar's immoral behavior and
homosexuality. Anwar denies the police charges against him and says
his only fault has been to challenge Mahathir's 17-year-reign.
	   Soon after Anwar's arrest, police ordered his wife to stop
making public statements or face the same fate as her husband.
Malaysians face arrest for organizing pro-reform protests.
	   At least 16 people, many of them governing party members who
backed Anwar, are in jail under the Internal Security Act, a
British colonial law that allows for imprisonment without trial.
	   The London-based human rights group, Amnesty International,
Friday labeled Anwar and the others detained under ISA as
``prisoners of conscience.''
	   Amnesty said it was concerned ``that all the men are at risk of
ill-treatment.''
	   ``By misusing Malaysia's laws to detain his political opponents,
Prime Minister Mahathir is contravening international legal
standards,'' the Amnesty statement said.
	   Three men were detained by riot police who charged into
Malaysia's biggest mosque Friday to chase demonstrators shouting
slogans against Mahathir.
	   The three were arrested for throwing stones at police, Ghazali
Mohd Amin, a police spokesman, said Friday night.
	   Anwar has not been seen by even his family and lawyers since he
was marched off by masked riot policemen on Sunday. Repeated
requests for information about the 51-year-old politician have
elicited no response from the police.

to court for trial,'' Mahathir told reporters.

Singapore: Malaysian airspace restrictions hampered rescue mission
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Malaysia's recent decision revoking blanket
approval for Singapore military aircraft to enter its airspace
jeopardizes search and rescue missions, Singapore's deputy prime
minister said late Friday.
	   A Singapore search and rescue aircraft lost about 15 percent of
its search time Wednesday night because it had to use an indirect
route to the scene of a British helicopter crash in the South China
Sea.
	   Malaysia initially denied access to the Singapore rescue
aircraft, but finally granted approval 4 1/2 hours later. A British
navy crewman, Lt. Toby Beale, died in the incident.
	   ``If the previous arrangement had been in place, we would have
got there earlier, and this means that we could have searched a
longer time,'' said Deputy Prime Minister and Defense Minister Tony
Tan said on national television news late Friday.
	   ``This would have increased the chances of rescuing the person
in distress,'' he added.
	   Last week, Malaysia revoked the long-standing agreement allowing
all Singapore military aircraft to enter its airspace while in
transit or on search and rescue missions.
	   The abrupt decision was the latest development in a bitter row
between the two Southeast Asian neighbors, which have bickered
recently over everything from the relocation of a railroad border
checkpoint to Singapore patriarch Lee Kuan Yew's memoirs, which are
critical of past Malaysian leaders.
	   Tan said the previous airspace arrangements benefited everyone,
according to a Saturday report in The Straits Times newspaper.
	   ``I would like to emphasize that the standby arrangements for
RSAF (Republic of Singapore Airforce) planes to use Malaysia
airspace are not only for the benefit of Singapore,'' Tan was
quoted as saying in the report.
	   ``This was unfortunately highlighted in the incident on
Wednesday night,'' he added.
	   In addition to the airspace issue, Malaysia recently pulled out
of planned military exercises under the Five Power Defense
Arrangement. The FPDA groups Britain, Australia, New Zealand,
Malaysia and Singapore.
	   Tan said Singapore is ready to renew FPDA exercises when
Malaysia is ready to do so, reported state-run television.
	   He said the FPDA is important for regional security, especially
with uncertainties brought on by the economic crisis.
	   ``Any arrangement which would help to increase stability and
lessen insecurity is of course valuable, and in this respect, the
FPDA _ which is a tried and tested arrangement that has shown its
value over the years _ would be important,'' Tan said in the
television news report.

Wakanohana, Takanohana tied for lead at 12-2
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Yokozuna (grand champion) Wakanohana kept his hopes
alive for a sixth tournament victory Saturday by beating Akebono to
move into a tie with yokozuna Takanohana at 12-2 going into the
final of the 15-day Autumn Grand Sumo Tournament.
	   Takanohana, who lost to ozeki (champion) Musashimaru, or Fiamalu
Penitani, in an unimpressive performance, will face his older
brother Wakanohana in a playoff if both win their matches Sunday.
	   Takanohana seemed to hardly put up a struggle as Musashimaru
(10-4) dragged him to the ringside and gave him a decisive push
out.
	   Takanohana is seeking his 20th tournament victory following a
triumph in the last tournament.
	   In the day's final bout, Wakanohana grabbed yokozuna Akebono's
shoulders and toppled him with an overarm throw. Akebono, or Chad
Rowan from Hawaii, is now 10-4 and has no hope of winning the
tournament.
	   Wakanohana will face Musashimaru, and Takanohana will fight
Akebono on Sunday.
	   Ozeki Takanonami survived at the ringside and threw down No. 6
maegashira Tochinonada (7-7). Takanonami is 9-5.
	   Sekiwake Chiyotaikai bulldozed out No. 4 maegashira Wakanosato
(6-8) with a series of powerful hand thrusts. Chiyotaikai is 9-5.
	   In other major bouts, No. 5 maegashira Kyokushuzan, or Mongolian
Batbayar Davaa, was shoved out by sekiwake Takatoriki (7-7),
suffering his 10th defeat against four victories.
	   In the 26-member juryo division, just below the senior makuuchi
rank, No. 5-ranked Kyokutenho, or Mongolian Tsevegnyam Nyamjav,
threw out No. 6-ranked Ohinode, leaving both at 8-6.
	   No. 13-ranked Hoshitango, or Argentine Imach Marcelo Salomon,
slapped down No. 11-ranked Otsukasa (8-6) for his ninth victory
against five defeats.
	   In the top junior division of Makushita, No. 12-ranked
Kaishinzan (4-3), or American Henry Armstrong Miller, was shoved
out by No. 8-ranked Daikiyama.
	   In sandanme, the second-highest junior division, No. 2-ranked
Ikemori, or Brazilian Luis Go Ikemori, was pushed down by No.
13-ranked Kotonoyama for his fourth defeat against three wins.
	   No. 33-ranked Azumakaze, or Brazilian Tussato Giuliano Kotinda,
slapped down No. 31-ranked Wakanoshima for a record of 3-4.
	   Wrestlers in junior divisions have only seven bouts during the
15-day tournament.

EU debates Russian crisis, seeks to raise international profile
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos Covering &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ European Union finance ministers sought
Saturday to forge a common position on how to handle Russia's
economic woes while raising the EU's profile in world financial
affairs.
	   The ministers from the 15 EU nations will be joined by Michel
Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund for
talks on Russia, but Belgian Finance Minister Jean-Jacques Viseur
cautioned the meeting is not likely to produce any ``miracle
solutions.''
	   On Friday, an IMF team left Moscow without recommending release
of the next installment of a dlrs 22.6 billion loan package.
	   The ministers are also looking at the international role of the
economic bloc that will be formed when 11 nations adopt the euro as
their shared currency on Jan. 1.
	   The euro-zone will be one of the world's largest economic powers
alongside the United States and Japan, and ministers said the
current economic troubles in emerging markets showed the bloc
needed a united voice on world financial affairs.
	   ``The euro countries should play an active role, right now on
the international scene,'' said Spanish Economic Affairs Minister
Rodrigo Rato.
	   However, for the moment, they cannot agree on how they should be
represented in international financial bodies such as the IMF or
the G-7 group of economic powers.
	   France has suggested that the euro-zone's current G-7 nations _
France, Italy and Germany _ take turns to represent the whole bloc.
Smaller nations complain that shuts them out.
	   ``This debate will continue over the coming week,'' said EU
Finance Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy. ``There is a will to
resolve this, there is no confrontation between the two camps.''
	   Meeting in the Hofburg Imperial Palace, the EU ministers
expressed confidence Europe would escape the worst of the economic
troubles plaguing emerging markets, despite forecasts showing
slower-than-expected growth in some nations.
	   ``There is no reason to panic, even if we are going through a
period of uncertainty,'' De Silguy told reporters.
	   EU sources said there were differences between finance ministers
and central bankers over whether interest rate cuts may be needed
to help protect Europe from the outside turbulence.
	   ``Europe must pursue stability and growth and recognize that the
balance of risk in the world economy has shifted,'' Britain's
Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown said in a BBC interview,
appearing to suggest that risks of a slowdown were now a bigger
danger than inflation.

Shanghai puts three to death for murder, rape, robbery
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ In mass rallies signaling a renewed
crackdown on crime, courts in China's financial capital executed
three people for rape, murder and robbery, the official Liberation
Daily reported Saturday.
	   Shanghai's Nos. 1 and 2 intermediate courts held the sentencing
rallies Friday. Immediately afterwards, Tang Aizhong, Luo Wufeng
and Zhou Guihua were taken to the execution grounds and shot, the
Shanghai-based newspaper said.
	   Tang gang-raped three women, along with unidentified partners,
in a suburban Shanghai village last June, the newspaper reported.
He also stole 2,000 yuan (dlrs 250) in cash and goods from one
villager.
	   Lou broke into a Shanghai home on March 6, fatally beat its
occupant to death and stole 2,000 yuan (dlrs 250) in cash and
goods.
	   China uses the death penalty more liberally than any other
nation. London-based Amnesty International recorded 1,876
court-ordered executions last year, more than the combined total of
the rest of the world.
	   The Liberation Daily said Friday's mass sentencing rallies were
part of a stepped-up autumn crackdown in a two-year-old nationwide
anti-crime crusade.

Sanchez-Vicaro, Seles advance to final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with doubles, Tanasugarn quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By PHIl BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Top seed Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario survived a key
game with a little luck and a spectacular retrieval Saturday and
beat Anke Huber 6-1, 3-6, 6-3, advancing to her fifth consecutive
Toyota Princess Cup final.
	   For the third year in a row, her final opponent will be Monica
Seles, a 6-1, 6-4 semifinal winner over Thailand's Tamarine
Tanasugarn. Seles, who has won the tournament four times, is
seeking her third consecutive title here. Sanchez-Vicario was the
1994 champion and then lost in the next three finals.
	   Against Huber, Sanchez-Vicario took a medical timeout to have
her right wrist taped at the end of the second set. The WTA No. 4
started the third by quickly losing her serve and falling behind
40-0 in the next game.
	   But at 40-15, Huber missed a forehand into a wide open court and
Sanchez-Vicario reached deuce on a running backhand down the line
off what looked like a winning short, sharp crosscourt.
	   Huber missed another chance with a backhand wide, and
Sanchez-Vicario finally evened the score 1-1 on her fifth break
point.
	   After Sanchez-Vicario broke again for 4-2, Huber threatened to
break back. But from 0-40, the 7th-seeded German netted three
shots, watched an ace zip past her and then netted another shot.
	   She was cited for a code violation as the threw her racket
across to the court to her sideline seat.
	   Sanchez-Vicario, the French Open champion, had to save two more
break points in the final game before winning the two-hour match on
a backhand wide by Huber _ her 11th victory in 13 meetings between
the two.
	   Starting out aggressively, Sanchez-Vicario played flawless
tennis in the first set, but Huber began to find the range with her
heavy hitting in the second set and kept the Spaniard on the
defensive.
	   In the final set's second game, ``I don't know what happened,''
Huber said. ``Everything looked like I was going to win that game
for 2-0. I wasn't aggressive enough, and she started to play
better.
	   ``It's always hard against her. ... For a couple of games (after
the timeout) she just pushed the ball back, and suddenly she was
playing normally again. It was kind of weird,'' Huber added.
	   Sanchez-Vicario said of her hitting arm: ``It was not an injury.
It just got tight.''
	   She said the balls had felt heavy all week, and she started
feeling the problem in the second set.
	   The trainer's massage on her arm and taping of the wrist
``helped me to serve better and loosen up and hit my shots
better,'' she said.
	   ``On the important points I went for my shots again like I did
in the first set,'' she added.
	   Seles, the WTA No. 6, needed just 65 minutes to beat Tamarine
here for the second consecutive year. She saved some of her best
points for the last game with some impressive volleying, a backhand
winner from a hard rally and an ace on her second match point.
	   ``Tammy has very good ground strokes. A few times, her serve let
her down,'' Seles said. ``She's a hard worker and she enjoys
tennis, and those are really good signs. I like her very much as a
person. She's very gracious.''
	   But for Sanchez-Vicario, against whom she has a 16-3 record,
Seles said, ``I'll have to play some unbelievable tennis.''
	   Informed later of Seles' compliments, Tamarine responded:
``Wow.''
	   ``Every match I play with a top ten player I feel great. It's a
good opportunity,'' said the Thai player, who was happy with
reaching the semifinals of both singles and doubles.
	   After a day on which a high wind played tricks on the players,
the tournament was back indoors Saturday, with the roof closed on
the Ariake Colosseum because of rain.

Russian government seeks restoration of vodka revenues
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN IAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Economic crisis or no crisis, Russians still have
a strong penchant for vodka and the government wants to turn that
thirst into cash.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov announced this week that
beginning Oct. 1, the government would reintroduce a monopoly on
the production and wholesale trade of alcohol.
	   ``In Soviet times, taxes on alcohol made up 30 percent of state
revenues,'' Ivan Starikov, a deputy minister in the previous
government, said in the Saturday edition of Izvestia.
	   Now, he said, revenues from excise taxes on alcohol production
is less than 2 percent. ``This is a catastrophe for the budget,''
he said.
	   Starikov said it would not be difficult to reimpose a monopoly
on liquor production, and that 80 percent of alcohol processing
plants are already state property or share holdings.
	   Now, he said, it was necessary for the government to change to
law, and enact a direct national sales tax on vodka, rather than
the existing excise tax on producers.
	   Under current law, he said, local authorities take half the
excise tax for their own budgets and regional governors want to
maintain control of vodka production on their territories. As a
result, there are 800 legal factories in Russia, compared to 150
during Soviet times.
	   ``A sales tax will cool down the governors,'' Starikov said.
``It will make no difference where the vodka is produced.''
	   Alexander Shokhin, the deputy prime minister in charge of
economics who resigned Friday, said the day before he quit that a
government monopoly on alcohol production would bring in
significant revenues.
	   He told a news conference Thursday that additional revenues
could bring in 15 billion rubles (about dlrs 1 billion) this year.
The returns could be used to pay belated salaries, pensions and
military officers' allowances, he said.
	   But getting the tax revenues into the government's coffers
remains a problem.
	   Moonshine manufacturing and evasion of taxes cost the government
an estimated 18 billion rubles (dlrs 2.9 billion) in the first five
months of this year, according to officials.
	   The official monthly taxable output of vodka averaged about 55
million liters (14.4 million gallons) in the first half of the
year, according to Vladimir Yarmosh, chief of the state-run
Spirtprom association, which controls vodka production. But twice
as much had been manufactured and sold illegally, without tax
payments, he told Russian news agencies in June.

Ultranationalist Serb leader warns against NATO strike in Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The radical who won the
race for the Bosnian Serb presidency on Saturday said he would work
more closely with Serbia but also pledged to play by democratic
rules in office.
	   Nikola Poplasen is allied with the Bosnian Serb faction backing
war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic. His victory, announced Friday
by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, is
considered a blow against U.S.-backed attempts to encourage
moderation across Bosnia through financial aid to areas with
political leaders working to implement the Dayton peace agreement.
	   During the war and for the first years afterward, Bosnian Serb
radicals in charge pressed for union of the Serb part of Bosnia
with Serbia proper, something ruled out by the Dayton provisions,
which specifically mandate Bosnia as a nation made up of the Serb
substate and the Croat-Muslim federation.
	   Poplasen who ousted Western-backed incumbent Biljana Plavsic,
also criticized plans for a possible NATO strike in Serbia, in an
attempt to stop months of fighting between government forces and
Albanian guerrillas.
	   Serbia _ the main Yugoslav republic, which includes Kosovo
province _ would be justified in defending its territory in case of
such a scenario, he told reporters.
	   The West worries that a Poplasen government would work against
Dayton peace agreement provisions meant to restore a degree of
ethnic tolerance and introduce democracy to post-war Bosnia.
	   But on Saturday, Poplasen and his coalition partner, Dragan
Kalinic, pledged to preserve ``all the good that the international
community and the previous moderate Serb government accomplished''
and strive for a democratic society based on market economy.
	   The hardliners congratulated moderate Zivko Radisic on winning
the Serb seat of Bosnia's tripartite presidency. Poplasen said his
past relations with Radisic were ``correct and problem-free.''
	   Poplasen, who is due to appoint the premier-designate for the
Bosnian Serb substate, said he would listen to all suggestions and
was looking for a person ready to cooperate with other
parliamentary parties and the international community.
	   Plavsic congratulated her opponent on his victory.
	   Addressing the public through a live broadcast on an independent
television late Friday night, she said any reversal to the past was
impossible.

Police cordon off Kuala Lumpur's Independence Square
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with demonstrators dispersed and comments from chief
justice

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Hundreds of riot police cordoned
off the capital's historic Merdexa Square Saturday to head off
anti-government protests by supporters of ousted deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Police blocked all roads leading to the square, where Malaysia's
independence from British colonialists was proclaimed in 1957.
Dozens of trucks and buses filled with armed security personnel
were parked nearby.
	   Several hundred activists who had gathered near the National
Mosque shouting ``Long live Anwar'' tried to sneak in but were
dispersed quickly by policemen on horseback and riot guards armed
with batons, shields and tear gas.
	   One person who was carrying a Malaysian flag with pictures of
Anwar pasted on it was arrested and handcuffed by police amid loud
jeering by the crowds.
	   Pro-democracy activists scheduled protests at three mosques
nearby in the heart of the city. Police feared that activists would
march to the square in a repeat of last Sunday's mammoth rally
after which Anwar was arrested.
	   Shopkeepers pulled down their shutters in some adjoining areas
in anticipation of violence as the police moved in.
	   Hundreds of leaflets announcing the protest were distributed at
Friday's weekly prayer at the city's National Mosque, which turned
into a rally.
	   Such protests, until recently unheard of in Malaysia, are fast
becoming routine. They started after Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad fired Anwar on Sept. 2 and escalated after his arrest under
a security provision.
	   Anwar is accused of various crimes, including unlawful sex acts,
and leaking state secrets. He has denied the charges, saying they
were politically motivated. Anwar said his only fault was
challenging Mahathir's 17-year-reign.
	   Soon after Anwar's arrest, police ordered his wife to stop
making public statements or face the same fate as her husband.
Malaysians face arrest for organizing pro-reform protests.
	   At least 16 people, many of them governing party members who
backed Anwar, are in jail under the Internal Security Act, a
British colonial law that allows for imprisonment without trial.
	   The London-based human rights group, Amnesty International,
Friday labeled Anwar and the others detained under ISA as
``prisoners of conscience'' and accused Mahathir of ``contravening
international legal standards.''
	   Anwar has not been seen by even his family and lawyers since he
was marched off by masked riot policemen. Police have not responded
to repeated requests for information about him.
	   Mahathir said Friday that Anwar would be brought to court when
the protests stopped.
	   ``If he will tell his followers not to riot, he will be brought
to court for trial,'' Mahathir told reporters.

U.S. must `exert pressure' on Israel for peace _ Tarawneh
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo AMM-101 &QL; 
 &UR; By JAMAL HALABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The United States should ``exert pressure''
on Israel to move forward negotiations with the Palestinians,
Jordanian Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh said Saturday.
	   In his first news conference since taking office Aug. 20,
Tarawneh said he planned to brief U.S. officials during a visit
scheduled next week on Israeli obstacles placed on Jordanian trade
with the Palestinians. He did not say whom he would meet.
	   ``We think the United States should ... exert pressure on the
Israeli side to move'' forward in peace talks, Tarawneh said.
	   He said a regional settlement was still possible. But he added
that a stalemate in negotiations since 1997 had diminished ``to
zero'' the trust between the Palestinians and Israel.
	   Tarawneh, 50, led the Jordanian team to negotiations that
culminated in the 1994 peace treaty with Israel.
	   During his visit to Washington, Tarawneh said he would bring up
Israeli barriers in trade with the Palestinians. ``I want to put it
very, very bluntly in Washington,'' he said.
	   He did not say if he wanted the Americans to intercede with
Israel to ease bureaucratic procedures and long delays at border
crossings. Officials blame the delays for diminished
Palestinian-Jordanian trade, which amounts to just dlrs 26 million.
Palestinian trade with Israel is estimated at dlrs 3 billion
yearly.
	   Tarawneh declined to say if Jordan would support a Palestinian
declaration of statehood next year, but reiterated the official
line of unequivocal Jordanian backing for the ``establishment of a
Palestinian state on its national soil.''

Tudjman condemns inter-party rows; demands investigation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SNJEZANA VUKIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ President Franjo Tudjman on Saturday
demanded an urgent investigation into allegations that military
counter-intelligence is involved in a media campaign against
liberal politicians.
	   Tudjman announced unspecified consequences against those
involved. He was reacting to the controversy created by comments
from his Cabinet chief, who on Thursday accused another close
Tudjman aide of coordinating media attacks against moderates within
Tudjman's governing Croatian Democratic Union.
	   The accusations, by Hrvoje Sarinic against Ivic Pasalic, were
similar to ones raised earlier last week by another moderate
Tudjman supporter, Franjo Greguric.
	   Pasalic, a hardliner, denied the accusations.
	   The public battle reflected the growing rift between hardliners,
usually characterized as nationalists who oppose democracy, and
moderates, who lean toward organizing Croatia along Western lines.
	   The conflict has grown as the party loses popularity ahead of
next year's parliamentary elections. It is also seen as a way for
the two sides to position themselves for eventual party control
after Tudjman, who is rumored to be seriously ill, is gone.
	   The current affair might prompt Tudjman to finally side with one
of the fractions.
	   It is ``utterly inadmissible and irresponsible'' of senior state
and party members ``to get engaged into public discussion over the
sensitive issues of national security,'' he said in a statement.
	   When the investigation over the allegations is over, ``adequate
decisions'' will be made, the statement said, without elaborating.
	   Sarinic, in the second part of his interview published on
Saturday in the daily Jutarnji list, insisted Tudjman should deal
with the hardliners and intelligence service methods that he said
reminded him to the notorious secret service in the former
Communist Yugoslavia.
	   Croatia was a part of Yugoslavia until 1991. The Yugoslav secret
service was commonly considered ready to use all means to destroy
opponents of the ruling Communists.

EU debates Russian crisis, seeks to raise international profile
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By PAUL AMES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ European Union finance ministers sought
Saturday to forge a common position on how to handle Russia's
economic woes while raising the EU's profile in world financial
affairs.
	   The ministers from the 15 EU nations will be joined by Michel
Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary Fund for
talks on Russia, but Belgian Finance Minister Jean-Jacques Viseur
cautioned the meeting is not likely to produce any ``miracle
solutions.''
	   On Friday, an IMF team left Moscow without recommending release
of the next installment of a dlrs 22.6 billion loan package.
	   The ministers are also looking at the international role of the
economic bloc that will be formed when 11 nations adopt the euro as
their shared currency on Jan. 1.
	   The euro-zone will be one of the world's largest economic powers
alongside the United States and Japan, and ministers said the
current economic troubles in emerging markets showed the bloc
needed a united voice on world financial affairs.
	   ``The euro countries should play an active role, right now on
the international scene,'' said Spanish Economic Affairs Minister
Rodrigo Rato.
	   However, for the moment, they cannot agree on how they should be
represented in international financial bodies such as the IMF or
the G-7 group of economic powers.
	   France has suggested that the euro-zone's current G-7 nations _
France, Italy and Germany _ take turns to represent the whole bloc.
Smaller nations complain that shuts them out.
	   ``This debate will continue over the coming week,'' said EU
Finance Commissioner Yves-Thibault de Silguy. ``There is a will to
resolve this, there is no confrontation between the two camps.''
	   Meeting in the Hofburg Imperial Palace, the EU ministers
expressed confidence Europe would escape the worst of the economic
troubles plaguing emerging markets, despite forecasts showing
slower-than-expected growth in some nations.
	   ``There is no reason to panic, even if we are going through a
period of uncertainty,'' De Silguy told reporters.
	   EU sources said there were differences between finance ministers
and central bankers over whether interest rate cuts may be needed
to help protect Europe from the outside turbulence.
	   ``Europe must pursue stability and growth and recognize that the
balance of risk in the world economy has shifted,'' Britain's
Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown said in a BBC interview,
appearing to suggest that risks of a slowdown were now a bigger
danger than inflation.

on Israel to press ahead in negotiations with the Palestinians,
Jordan's prime minister said Saturday.
	   In his first news conference since taking office Aug. 20, Prime
Minister Fayez Tarawneh said he also planned to brief U.S.
officials during a visit scheduled next week on Israeli obstacles
to Jordanian trade with the Palestinians.
	   He did not say if he wanted the Americans to intercede with
Israel to ease bureaucratic procedures and long delays at border
crossings. Officials blame the delays for diminished
Palestinian-Jordanian trade, which amounts to just dlrs 26 million.
Palestinian trade with Israel is estimated at dlrs 3 billion
yearly.
	   As for peace, Tarawneh said a regional settlement was still
possible, but a stalemate in negotiations since 1997 had diminished
``to zero'' the trust between the Palestinians and Israel.
	   ``We think the United States should ... exert pressure on the
Israeli side to move'' forward in peace talks, Tarawneh said.
	   Tarawneh, 50, led the Jordanian team in talks that led to the
1994 peace treaty with Israel.
	   Tarawneh declined to say if Jordan would support a Palestinian
declaration of statehood next year, but reiterated that Jordanian
would back the ``establishment of a Palestinian state on its
national soil.''

Greek-Romanian hostage taker found dead in prison hospital

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A Greek-Romanian whose taking of four
hostages led to one of the most disastrous police operations in
recent Greek history was found dead of mysterious circumstances in
a prison hospital Saturday, security officials said.
	   Sorin Matei, 27, riveted Greeks to their television sets on
Wednesday when he called the anchorman of a major private
television station to broadcast his demands live after bursting
into a central Athens apartment and holding a family of four
hostage with a hand grenade.
	   The official cause of his death was not immediately known
	   During the live interview with Skai channel's Nikos Evangelatos,
Matei said he could not afford to be arrested because he was sure
he would be killed once in prison.
	   ``They will suicide me,'' said Matei, who had escaped from
custody six times and had already spent nearly a decade in jail
serving sentences for attempted murder and armed robberies. He had
more than 25 years left to serve.
	   Wednesday night's four-hour standoff ended in disaster when the
hand grenade detonated during a botched police operation to free
the hostages. Matei, one young woman captive and 10 police
officers, including police chief Thanassis Vassilopoulos and his
second-in-command, were injured in the blast. The woman hostage
remains in critical condition. Police said they thought the grenade
was fake, eventhough Matei had used it twice before to threaten
officers.
	   Vassilopoulos resigned over the incident, while the heads of the
Athens' metropolitan police and the security forces were suspended.
	   Matei was transfered to Athens' main Korydallos hospital prison
on Friday. Doctors at the public hospital where he was taken to
immediatly after the explosion said his condition was not serious.
	   The prison said its hospital staff were unable to revive Matei
after he collapsed when a prosecutor appeared to take his statement
on the hostage incident.
	   ``The government must shed ample light on the curious result of
Wednesday's indescribable operation,''said Greece's main opposition
New Democracy party.
	   Justice Minister Evangelos Yannopoulos ordered three coroners to
examine the Greek-Romanian's body at Korydallos.
	   Conditions at Korydallos maximum security prison are said to be
very bad. Badly overcrowded, conditions at Korydallos have
frequently led to mass jail breaks and violent prison riots during
which several inmates have died. It is considered to be one of the
better jails in Greece.
	   Matei had embarrassed the Greek police several times, escaping
from police transfer facilities, prisons and court buildings.
	   On Sept. 6, he used a hand grenade to take a police officer
hostage for almost eight hours before security forces released him.
He fled in a taxi and police were unable to track him down until
Wednesday, when they located him hiding inside an apartment
building near the capital's red light district.

Fukushima, Ku share lead in Miyagi TV Cup Dunlop Ladies Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIYAGI, Japan (AP) _ Akiko Fukushima, the leading money winner
in the last two seasons, fired a 68 Saturday and shared a
three-stroke lead with overnight leader Ku Ok-hee going into the
final round of the Miyagi TV Cup Dunlop Ladies Open.
	   Fukushima, in contention for her second title of the season and
13th overall, offset a bogey with five birdies en route to the
day's best round and a 7-under 137 total.
	   ``I wasn't hitting as good as yesterday off the tee,'' said
Fukushima who often drives in the 300-yard (270-meter) range. ``So
I just tried to be conservative at the tee and even used a 3-wood
on one occasion. Perhaps that helped me stay in the rhythm.''
	   ``I was getting the ball on the right place on the green, and I
was putting well,'' Fukushima added.
	   South Korean veteran Ku, also seeking her second victory this
season and 15th overall in Japan, had a round of four birdies and a
bogey for a 69.
	   ``She (Fukushima) is in good shape and playing well. I'll have
to concentrate on the game tomorrow with an aim to score a 3-under
or better,'' said Ku, formerly a regular on the U.S. tour.
	   Alone in third place three strokes back at 140 was unheralded
Fumiko Omata, who shot a 69.
	   Kaori Harada matched par 72 and placed fourth two shots further
behind at 142.
	   Former South Korean amateur star Han Hee-won, in her second
tournament after qualifying for the Japan tour, carded a 72 and
shared fifth at 143 with Aki Takamura, Megumi Matsuo, Hisako Takeda
and Taiwan's Li Wen-lin.
	   Michiko Hattori, who is leading this year's money list, had a 74
for 151 and missed the cut by two strokes.
	   The 60 million yen (dlrs 446,000) event offers a top prize of
10.8 million yen (dlrs 80,200).

Gadhafi criticizes NATO threats against Serbs in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi has sent
letters to world leaders criticizing NATO's threats to use force
against Serbs in Kosovo, warning such action could lead to another
``world war,'' Libya's official news agency JANA reported.
	   Gadhafi's letter Thursday followed NATO's warning that it would
use force to end Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic's crackdown
on ethnic Albanians in the province of Kosovo, the agency said in a
report faxed Saturday to the Associated Press in Cairo.
	   ``It is a dangerous deterioration .. for the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization to intervene in internal troubles of a country
that is not'' a NATO member, Gadhafi said in the letter, which was
sent to leaders of China, India, Russia and Brazil.
	   ``This tyranny will also lead to the collapse of stability in
the world and lead to a world war,'' Gadhafi said.
	   Earlier this week, the United States and other NATO members
agreed to begin assembling their firepower to strike targets in
Yugoslavia, though they have set no specific date for an attack.

Police cordon off Kuala Lumpur's Independence Square
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with demonstrators gathering

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Police used a water cannon
Saturday to break up a huge gathering in downtown Kuala Lumpur in
support of ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   There were no immediate reports of injuries, but police arrested
dozens of people and led them away in handcuffs for shouting
pro-Anwar slogans or waving posters.
	   Standing along barricades, thousands of people shouted ``Reform,
reform'' as police cordoned off the capital's historic Independence
Square in a bid to prevent supporters from holding a rally.
	   Several thousand activists gathered even though police had
blocked all roads leading to the Merdeka Square, where Malaysia's
independence from British colonialists was proclaimed in 1957.
	   Activists who had gathered near mosques shouting ``Long live
Anwar'' were dispersed quickly by policemen on horseback and riot
guards armed with batons, shields and tear gas. They regrouped
quickly at a different spot.
	   Pro-democracy activists had scheduled protests at three mosques
nearby in the heart of the city. Police feared that activists would
march to the square in a repeat of last Sunday's mammoth rally
after which Anwar was arrested.
	   Shopkeepers pulled down their shutters in some adjoining areas
in anticipation of violence as the police moved in earlier on
Saturday.
	   Hundreds of leaflets announcing the protest were distributed at
Friday's weekly prayer at the city's National Mosque, which turned
into a rally.
	   Such protests, until recently unheard of in Malaysia, are fast
becoming routine. They started after Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad fired Anwar on Sept. 2 and escalated after his arrest under
a security provision.
	   Anwar is accused of various crimes, including unlawful sex acts,
and leaking state secrets. He has denied the charges, saying they
were politically motivated. Anwar said his only fault was
challenging Mahathir's 17-year-reign.
	   Soon after Anwar's arrest, police ordered his wife to stop
making public statements or face the same fate as her husband.
Malaysians face arrest for organizing pro-reform protests.
	   At least 16 people, many of them governing party members who
backed Anwar, are in jail under the Internal Security Act, a
British colonial law that allows for imprisonment without trial.
	   The London-based human rights group, Amnesty International,
Friday labeled Anwar and the others detained under ISA as
``prisoners of conscience'' and accused Mahathir of ``contravening
international legal standards.''
	   Anwar has not been seen since he was marched off by masked riot
policemen on Sunday. Police have not responded to repeated requests
for information about him.
	   On Friday, Mahathir said Anwar would be brought to court when
the protests stopped.
	   ``If he will tell his followers not to riot, he will be brought
to court for trial,'' Mahathir told reporters.

Swissair to help fishermen deprived of income since crash
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ Swissair will financially help
fishermen who have lost money since their fishing grounds were
sealed off by investigators probing the crash of Flight 111, the
airline said Saturday.
	   The Swiss national carrier will make an immediate payment of
25,000 Canadian dollars to a fund managed by Canadian fishing
associations, Swissair spokesman Peter Gutknecht said. Further aid
is being considered, Gutknecht added.
	   The associations have told Swissair the cash offered is adequate
for the time being, Gutknecht said.
	   Canadian authorities and Swissair officials have met some 150
fishermen who say they have lost income since the McDonnell Douglas
MD-11 plunged into the North Atlantic near Peggy's Cove, Nova
Scotia during the night of Sept. 2 and 3, killing all 229 people on
board.
	   The fishing season is at its peak and although investigators
reduced the size of the sealed-off crash site 10 days after the
accident, some fishermen say they fear they will lose all their
income.

	   ROMAGNE-SOUS-MONTFAUCON, France (AP) _ U.S. and French warjets
on Saturday screamed over one of the bloodiest battlefields of
World War I, honoring the thousands of Americans who fell there 80
years ago.
	   U.S. soldiers fired shots into the air and military bands from
both countries played at a ceremony marking the beginning of the
Meuse-Argonne offensive, on a battleground that became America's
largest cemetery in Europe.
	   Officials paid tribute to the thousands buried there as well as
the dwindling number of living veterans left, too feeble to attend.
	   ``Soon the generation that remembers the privations and horrors
of that most brutal of all wars will no longer be with us,'' U.S.
Army Secretary Louis Caldera told a gathering of about 1,000
invited guests.
	   ``It is only fitting that we should take this last opportunity
to thank them,'' he said, steps way from line upon line of marble
tombstones, each with a small American and French flag planted in
the grass.
	   ``The memory of their sacrifices will live forever,'' he said.
	   Veteran Affairs Secretary Togo West Jr. and French Veterans
Minister Jean-Pierre Masseret joined in placing wreaths at the
Meuse-Argonne American Cemetery.
	   ``On behalf of all of France,'' said Masseret, ``I want to
render tribute to their courage and their spirit of sacrifice.''
	   In the memory of the soldiers, ``we too must be soldiers for
peace,'' he said. And underlining U.S.-French cooperation, he said:
``Whether with the United Nations or NATO, we have work to do.''
	   After the playing of ``Taps,'' four U.S. F-16 and five French
Mirage fighter jets flew overhead.
	   It was 80 years to the day Gen. John Pershing launched his
``doughboys'' of the American Expeditionary Force into the
Meuse-Argonne offensive.
	   With 1.2 million U.S. soldiers, it was also the largest battle
of the U.S. war effort. More than 116,000 Americans died in the
war.
	   With 14,246 graves, the cemetery in eastern France lies on the
battle line where Americans like Cpl. Albert Thomas. Then an
infantryman in his early 20s, he was sent to bust through the
Hindenberg Line, the fortified German positions along a 40-mile
front in northern France.
	   Thomas, now 102 and living in Fostoria, Ohio, remembers the
constant roar of cannons and machine guns around the clock.
	   ``At night, we had patrols between our line and the enemy line,
the no-man's land. They had barbed wire strung all through there,''
Thomas said in a telephone interview.
	   Fear was something you just lived with, said the retired
chemical and railroad worker. ``There was nothing you could do
about it. We were there, and we had no choice.''
	   Thomas, his 17-year-old brother, Charles, and other recruits had
about three months of training in Alabama before they were sent to
the front with the Buckeye Division.
	   ``We didn't have too much training,'' he said. ``We just did the
best we could.''
	   After being elected on a peace platform, President Woodrow
Wilson was suddenly pressed into the war in 1917. The sinking of
the ocean liner Lusitania by a German submarine and the Zimmerman
telegram that courted Mexican support for Germany helped jar
Americans out of isolationism.
	   As a result, U.S. involvement began with hundreds of thousands
of barely trained troops like Thomas.
	   ``These were young kids with a tiny leavening of army guys,''
said Col. Peter Herrly, a U.S. defense attache at the U.S. Embassy
in Paris. ``They were in the middle of the toughest defenses the
Germans had constructed.''
	   The Germans ``had three years to perfect that, with concrete
bunkers, barbed wire, and cross-fire. It was like Omaha Beach''
during the D-Day, he said.
	   By all accounts, the U.S. involvement was pivotal in the war,
especially after German troops were rushed to the Western Front
when the Russian front collapsed in the 1917 Bolshevik revolution.
	   ``Regardless of French pride, you can't avoid saying that
without the Americans, the Franco-British force would have been
beaten,'' said French historian Jean-Jacques Becker.

MTV makes deputy on Russian television
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ MTV is now rocking and rolling on Russian
airwaves.
	   At midnight on Friday, the music channel made its television
debut on Moscow and St. Petersburg, with a mixture of Western rock,
pop and homegrown Russian hits.
	   It was not the first time Russians could watch MTV, but it's the
first time they have had it for free in their own language.
	   ``A long time ago, people watched MTV in many possible ways,
through satellites or they recorded MTV in the United States or
Europe and they brought the cassettes here,'' program presenter
Alexander Anatolievich said at a news conference before the debut.
	   MTV Russia will be be on the air 21 hours a day, with about 70
programs featuring some 7,000 music videos, show business and
sports news. It will also air one hour of non-stop Russian music in
prime time.
	   Also scheduled for MTV Russia will be well known programs such
as ``Beavis and Butt-head,'' but with some changes. Station
officials say it will be voiced over for local viewers and
vodka-induced hangovers will replace their beer equivalent.
	   At the start, MTV Russia will be 50 percent Russian and 50
percent Western music.
	   The latest airing of MTV expands the program's global reach.
There are already special MTV editions for Europe, Asia, Australia,
Brazil, Japan, Latin America and New Zealand.

Iran promises to produce longer-range missiles
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran will develop a new missile that will
outdistance its predecessor, which is already capable of striking
Israel, Iranian Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani said Saturday.
	   Iran unveiled the Shahab-3 missile during a military parade
Friday. The newly developed weapon has a range of 1,300 kilometers
(800 miles), which means it can hit Saudi Arabia and Israel.
	   ``Certainly we will work on the development of the Shahab-4 and
5, but this does not mean we will start tomorrow,'' he said.
	   In July, Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Martin Indyk said
Iran was working on the Shahab-4, which he called a greater threat
than its predecessor. He said the missile could be deployed in two
to five years and pledged that the United States would redouble its
efforts to curb the transfer of technology Iran needs to develop
it.
	   Iran is believed to have received substantial missile technology
from Russia and some from China and North Korea. The Shahab-3 is
believed to be based on North Korea's No Dong ballistic missile.
	   Shamkhani, a Navy rear admiral, denied at a news conference that
Iran had received help in developing the missiles.
	   Shamkhani said Iran would strike back at Israel if the Jewish
state attacked its nuclear plant in the southern town of Bushehr.
	   ``We'll certainly respond firmly to any Israeli attack or
aggression in a manner more severe than one can imagine, and we
have the capability. The most obvious, but only the minimum, is the
Shahab-3,'' Shamkhani said.
	   Shamkhani would not say how many missiles Iran possessed, but
indicated that Iran could produce as many as it needed.
	   Iran says the Shahab-3 can carry a one-ton warhead at a cruising
altitude of 250 kilometers (155 miles) above sea level.
	   U.S. and Israeli officials have expressed concern about the
missile because it can hit Israel and U.S. troops stationed in
Saudi Arabia. Iranian officials have said the missile is only for
defense and that they are free to strengthen their armed forces.
	   Iran had virtually no arms industry under the U.S.-supported
shah because Washington supplied nearly all of Iran's defense
needs. The shah was ousted during the 1979 Islamic revolution.
	   The Iranians launched an ambitious arms development program
during the 1980-88 war with Iraq to compensate for weapons
shortages caused by a U.S. embargo. Since 1992, it has unveiled its
own tanks, armored personnel carriers, missiles, and even a fighter
plane.

Thousands rally to pay respects to dead Nigerian deportee

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - Thousands of people gathered at Saint
Michel cathedral in Brussels Saturday for a religious ceremony in
memory of a Nigerian woman who died this week after police tried to
deport her to Africa.
	   The cathedral was packed with people long before the service
began. Thousands of Belgians and Africans stood on the cathedral
steps and in the streets, waiting for the arrival of Semira Adamu's
white coffin.
	   Louspeakers were placed outside the cathedral so the crowd could
hear the service, which included Christian and Muslim rites, as
well as speeches from human rights representatives who organized
the event. People deposed flowers on the steps.
	   No date has yet been fixed for Adamu's funeral. It's unclear
whether her remains will be flown back to Nigeria or buried in
Belgium.
	   Adamu, 20, died in a Brussels hospital last Tuesday from a brain
hemorrhage, hours after police had stuffed a pillow over her mouth
to restrain her on an airliner headed for Togo in West Africa.
	   Her death caused a public outcry over Belgium's asylum policy
and plunged the government into crisis.
	   On Friday Interior Minister Louis Tobback announced his
resignation, but the Socialist minister, who is also vice-premier,
was asked by the center-left coalition government to reconsider his
decision. He was expected to make an announcement later Saturday.
	   Tobback's decision came after he learned that one of the two
policemen who had tried to subdue Adamu had already been punished
by the police force last year for repeatedly kicking an asylum
seeker.
	   The crowd at the cathedral was subdued, but many onlookers
called for reform of the treatment of asylum seekers in Belgium.
	   ``What we have to change right away are the conditions of
detention for these people,'' said Christophe Janssen, a young
Belgian man.
	   ``These things that have happened are very shameful,'' said
Akrkpove Kotey, from Togo. ``We have Belgians in our country. We
show them respect. And we don't deserve respect?'' he said.
	   If Tobback confirms his resignation Saturday, it will be the
second time in five months the interior minister resigns. His
predecessor, Johan Vande Lanotte, stepped down after Marc Dutroux,
the key suspect in a pedophile case, briefly escaped.
	   Gino Russo, who campaigns for human rights since his
eight-year-old daughter Melissa was starved to death in a basement
cell beneath Dutroux's house, also attended Saturday's ceremony.
	   ``She is a young woman who was legally murdered,'' he said.
``Like so many laws in this country, the law on asylum sekkers is a
bad one,'' he added.
	   Adamu had resisted deportation five previous times. She claimed
her family was forcing her to marry a 65-year-old man who already
has three wives. Belgium argued that was not sufficient to grant
her refugee status.
	   On Friday, the World Organization Against Torture, a coalition
of human rights organizations, called in Geneva on Belgium to
abolish the practice of using pillows to subdue deportees which it
denounced as inhuman.
	   Belgian police spokeswoman Els Cleemput said the practice was
used twice last year. But she said resistance from deportees
increased this year and the police have used the practice a dozen
times already.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Police used a water cannon
Saturday to break up a huge gathering in downtown Kuala Lumpur in
support of ousted deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim. There were
no immediate reports of injuries, but police arrested dozens of
people and led them away in handcuffs for shouting pro-Anwar
slogans or waving posters. Standing along barricades, thousands of
people shouted ``Reform, reform'' as police cordoned off the
capital's historic Independence Square in a bid to prevent
supporters from holding a rally. Several thousand activists
gathered even though police had blocked all roads leading to the
Merdeka Square, where Malaysia's independence from British
colonialists was proclaimed in 1957. (MALAYSIA-POLITICS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Russian deputy prime minister who quit over
the naming of Mikhail Zadornov as finance minister said on Saturday
the appointment was a political mistake. Alexander Shokhin, who was
deputy prime minister in charge of economic policy, quit Friday
after President Boris Yeltsin announced the appointment of
Zadornov, a holdover finance minister who served in the previous
two administrations. ``By reappointing the man responsible for the
collapse of the financial system, (Prime Minister Yevgeny) Primakov
has assumed responsibility for the previous financial policy,''
Shokhin told a news conference. Shokhin said he was appointed
deputy prime minister only to serve as ``window dressing for the
West'' and that ``from the very beginning I was not meant to
influence the government's policy seriously.'' (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The radical who won the
race for the Bosnian Serb presidency said Saturday that he would
work more closely with Serbia but also pledged to play by
democratic rules in office. Nikola Poplasen is allied with the
Bosnian Serb faction backing war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic.
Poplasen, who ousted Western-backed incumbent Biljana Plavsic,
criticized plans for a possible NATO strike in Serbia as an attempt
to stop months of fighting between government forces and Albanian
guerrillas. Serbia _ the main Yugoslav republic, which includes
Kosovo province _ would be justified in defending its territory in
case of such a scenario, said. (BOSNIA-ELECTIONS)
	   KEY WEST, Florida (AP) _ Hurricane Georges barreled deep into
the Gulf of Mexico on Saturday, taking aim at the Gulf Coast and
leaving a trail of sunken houseboats, twisted trees and tangled
power lines in the soggy and windswept Florida Keys. After killing
more than 300 people in the Caribbean, Georges took no lives in
Florida. It skirted Miami and hit hardest in the Keys, where power
was knocked out for everyone and the full extent of the damage to
the 120-mile (190-kilometer) chain of low islands wasn't fully
known. The storm that made stop after deadly stop from the Virgin
Islands to the Dominican Republic and Haiti was expected to crash
into the Gulf Coast by early Sunday. (US-HURRICANE-FLORIDA)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ The flood of public documents detailing
President Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky is a trickle
compared to the deluge of what is about to be released. As part of
its preliminary impeachment inquiry, the House Judiciary Committee
agreed Friday to make public an estimated 60,000 pages that were in
the cartons that Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr sent to Congress
earlier this month. That is 20 times the volume released Monday.
The material includes grand jury testimony by Clinton's secretary,
Betty Currie; his friend, Vernon Jordan; and Linda Tripp, Ms.
Lewinsky's former friend; plus the secret audio tapes Mrs. Tripp
made of her telephone conversations with Ms. Lewinsky. It is in
those tapes, Starr alleges, Ms. Lewinsky discussed ways to cover up
her relationship with the president and urged Mrs. Tripp to follow
suit. The papers should be made public Thursday; the tapes will be
released once an audio expert removes bits that include profane
language, gossip and conversations that affect third parties.

Iran promises to produce longer-range missiles
</HEADLINE>

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran will develop a new missile that will
outdistance its predecessor, which is already capable of striking
Israel, Iranian Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani said Saturday.
	   Iran unveiled the Shahab-3 missile during a military parade
Friday. The newly developed weapon has a range of 1,300 kilometers
(800 miles), which means it can hit Saudi Arabia and Israel.
	   ``Certainly we will work on the development of the Shahab-4 and
5, but this does not mean we will start tomorrow,'' he said.
	   In July, Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Martin Indyk said
Iran was working on the Shahab-4, which he called a greater threat
than its predecessor. He said the missile could be deployed in two
to five years and pledged that the United States would redouble its
efforts to curb the transfer of technology Iran needs to develop
it.
	   Iran is believed to have received substantial missile technology
from Russia and some from China and North Korea. The Shahab-3 is
believed to be based on North Korea's No Dong ballistic missile.
	   Iranian officials have said the missile is only for defense and
that they are free to strengthen their armed forces.
	   Shamkhani, a navy rear admiral, denied at a news conference that
Iran received help in developing the missiles.
	   Shamkhani would not say how many missiles Iran possessed, but
indicated that Iran could produce as many as needed.
	   Iran says the Shahab-3 can carry a one-ton warhead at a cruising
altitude of 250 kilometers (155 miles) above sea level.

Australia wins qualifying tie
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOWNSVILLE, Australia (AP) _ Doubles specialists Todd Woodbridge
and Mark Woodforde led Australia back into the Davis Cup world
group with victory over Uzbekistan on Saturday.
	   Australia took an unbeatable 3-0 lead in the best of five tie
when Woodbridge and Woodforde beat Oleg Ogorodov and Dmitri
Tomashevich 6-3, 7-6 (7-3), 7-6 (7-4).
	   Australia was forced to play the qualifying tie after losing a
first-round contest against Zimbabwe in April.
	   The win was set up in Friday's singles as US Open champion
Patrick Rafter beat Ogorodov 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 and Jason Stoltenberg
beat Vadim Kutsenko 7-5, 6-1, 6-0.
	   Woodforde said the 3-0 scoreline had helped Australia put its
loss to Zimbabwe behind it.
	   ``It's great to win 3-0 and we were always looking for a quick
win and to get it over and done with,'' said Woodforde. ``We were
favorites going in but we were always going to be nervous early
just not knowing how they were going to play.''

Top UN refugee official visits refugees, calls for halt to violence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEKSANDAR VASOVIC &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The top U.N. official in charge of
refugees on Saturday visited shell-shocked victims of the
seven-month offensive against Kosovo separatists and urged
authorities to stop destroying villages.
	   ``I'm worried about winter,'' said Sadako Ogata, the United
Nations high commissioner for refugees. ``Time is against us and we
have to be as fast as possible.''
	   She voiced concerns of humanitarian aid organizations that many
of an estimated 50,000 refugees living in the open could grow ill
or die with the cold and lack of food in the coming winter.
	   They and more than another 200,000 refugees have fled their
homes since February when government forces launched a crackdown on
ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for independence of Kosovo, a
province of Serbia that is nonetheless 90 percent ethnic Albanian.
	   After visiting about 2,000 people in a refugee camp in Resnik
village, 30 kilometers (18 miles) northwest of Pristina, Ogata said
about 20 of them were wounded and many children were so traumatized
they were ``almost in a coma.''
	   Shelling was heard in distance during her visit and police
manning a roadblock that leads to the refugee camp said hundreds of
guerrillas were still close to the camp.
	   Serb sources said seven policemen died in the ongoing offensive
against hundreds of rebels holed up in the central Kosovo region of
Drenica.
	   Officials from the Serb Media Center, which releases information
from Serb authorities, said five policemen were killed Friday after
driving over a land mine, while two died in combat.
	   Police, who detained and released several foreign journalists
Friday for routine questioning, denied access to Resnik to
reporters Saturday, despite invitations from the Ogata's agency to
accompany her.
	   Speaking to reporters Saturday, Ogata said she asked Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic while in Belgrade to halt the
destruction and cooperate with the international community to ease
the suffering of civilians.
	   ``I have told Milosevic about burning of houses and I told him
that this is unacceptable,'' said Ogata of her Friday meeting with
Milosevic. ``He agreed, but I will have to raise that issue again.
There are no guarantees that repressive measures will stop.''
	   Ogata was scheduled to meet later Saturday with Ibrahim Rugova,
Kosovo's top ethnic Albanian political leader. On Friday, gunmen
wounded an aide to Rugova, days after killing another associate, in
a possible attempt to warn Rugova to accept nothing short of
independence for Kosovo.
	   There have been indications that Rugova and Milosevic could sign
a U.S.-backed agreement that would give Kosovo a degree of
self-rule but would leave it part of Serbia and thus within
Yugoslavia as part of the Serbian republic.

Thousands rally to pay respects to dead Nigerian deportee

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Thousands of people gathered at Saint
Michel cathedral in Brussels on Saturday for a service in memory of
a Nigerian woman who died when police tried to deport her to
Africa.
	   The cathedral was packed long before the service began.
Thousands of Belgians and Africans stood on the steps and in the
streets, waiting for the arrival of Semira Adamu's white coffin.
	   Loudspeakers were placed outside so the crowd could hear the
service, which included Christian and Muslim rites, as well as
speeches from human rights representatives who organized the event.
People left flowers on the steps.
	   No date was fixed for Adamu's funeral. It was not immediately
known if her remains would be flown back to Nigeria or buried in
Belgium.
	   Adamu, 20, died in a Brussels hospital Tuesday from a brain
hemorrhage, hours after police had stuffed a pillow over her mouth
to restrain her on an airliner headed for Togo in West Africa.
	   Her death caused a public outcry over Belgium's asylum policy
and plunged the government into crisis.
	   Interior Minister Louis Tobback announced his resignation
Friday, but the Socialist minister, who is also vice-premier, was
asked by the center-left coalition government to reconsider. He was
expected to make an announcement later Saturday.
	   Tobback's decision came after he learned that one of the two

called for reform of the treatment of asylum seekers in Belgium.

Belgian man.
	   ``These things that have happened are very shameful,'' said
Akrkpove Kotey, from Togo. ``We have Belgians in our country. We
show them respect. And we don't deserve respect?'' he said.
	   If Tobback confirms his resignation Saturday, it will be the
second time in five months that the interior minister has resigned.
His predecessor, Johan Vande Lanotte, stepped down after Marc
Dutroux, the key suspect in a pedophile case, briefly escaped.
	   Gino Russo, who has campaigned for human rights since his
8-year-old daughter Melissa was starved to death in a basement cell

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Communists and the Federation of Russian's
Independent Trade Unions will join forces on a national day of
protest Oct. 7, Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov said
Saturday.
	   Zyuganov met with Mikhail Shmakov, the federation leader, and
the two agreed to ``act in concert'' in the protest, the Interfax
news agency said.
	   ``Millions of Russians will take part in the action,'' Zyuganov
said. ``They will demand that President Boris Yeltsin resign, the
government's policy be changed and wages and pensions be paid.''
	   He said that he and Shmakov had agreed on all key issues
regarding the protest, including measures to ensure the security of
people during the demonstrations.
	   Zyuganov said the planned demonstrations were a serious protest.
``This is a demand by the people, a demand dictated by the present
situation, an initiative by workers,'' he said, according to
Interfax.
	   Labor groups have held an annual protest day in October in
recent years.

Australia heads to Ireland after topping group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Australia completed a clean sweep of
the Rugby World Cup pacific qualifying rounds Saturday to head the
group and ensure a place in its preferred Irish pool at next year's
finals.
	   Following earlier wins over Tonga and Fiji, the Wallabies struck
unexpected trouble against Western Samoa, before prevailing 25-13
at Ballymore.
	   In an earlier match of a double-header, Fiji condemned Tonga to
repechage rounds with a 32-15 win. Australia, Fiji and Western
Samoa all advanced directly to the finals to be played in Nov.
1999.
	   The Wallabies needed a 74th minute try from center Daniel
Herbert to kill off the Samoans, who crossed for two tries to
Australia's three.
	   The victory was built on the efforts of the Australian forward
pack, which produced first half tries from Willie Ofahengaue and
Dan Crowley _ his first in 29 tests.
	   The Samoans were fearless, led by skipper Pat Lam and hooker
Trevor Leota, who was player of the match.
	   After Jon Clarke's first half try, when he carried opposing half
George Gregan and winger Jason Little across the line as like they
were jockeys, the Samoans showed they were not overawed by the
Australians' reputations.
	   Leota showed he could step as well as tackle when he nipped
inside John Eales and slipped a pass to flanker Junior Paramore,
who set sail for the line after shaking off Stephen Larkham.
	   He accelerated around Wallaby fullback Joe Roff and scored after
his 25-meter solo burst.
	   A 22-point haul from Fiji's Waisale Serevi condemned Tonga to
three losses from three games.
	   Fiji went to the front early and was never headed.
	   Tonga will have to play home and away games against the
last-placed team in the Ireland qualifying pool, likely to be the
Russian state of Georgia.
	   The winner then plays against the survivor of the England-Asia
pools playoff.

in July-August by the heaviest monsoon rains in decades.
	   India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Australia, West Indies, England,

Franco leads in Gene Sarazen Jun Classic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHIOYA, Japan (AP) _ Carlos Franco of Paraguay shot a
7-under-par 65 Saturday and surged ahead for a two-stroke lead
after three rounds in the 110 million yen (dlrs 818,000) Gene
Sarazen Jun Classic.
	   Franco, winner of two tournaments this season, scored an eagle
and seven birdies against a pair of bogeys for a 14-under 202
total.
	   The 33-year-old Franco, who qualified for the Japan tour by
winning the Asian Tour's 1994 Order of Merit, is seeking his sixth
victory in Japan.
	   Australian Craig Parry, an overnight co-leader, fired a 68 and
was two strokes behind at 204.
	   Another shot back at 205 came American Todd Hamilton, who carded
a 68.
	   Defending champion Eduardo Herrera of Colombia, another
co-leader overnight, had a 70 and was alone in fourth place at 206.
	   Nobuhito Sato sank eight birdies in a bogey-free round for the
day's best score of 64 en route to a tie for fifth at 207 with
Ryoken Kawagishi and Hajime Meshiai.
	   Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki, who is leading the money list with two
victories so far this season, shot a 70 for a share of 27th at 211.

Pakistan hopes for progress at fresh talks with India
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistan is hoping for real progress
on the 50-year-old Kashmir dispute when it meets its hostile
neighbor India next month in Islamabad to resume stalled talks, a
foreign ministry spokesman said Saturday.
	   ''We are not oblivious of the fact that all bilateral efforts to
find a just settlement of the Kashmir issue have in the past
foundered on the rock of Indian intransigence. Yet we are ready to
sincerely make a fresh effort,'' foreign ministry spokesman Tariq
Altaf said at a news briefing.
	   The talks are scheduled for Oct. 15 to Oct. 18.
	   Pakistan and India have fought two wars over Kashmir since they
won independence from Britain in 1947. Each country holds part of
the disputed valley and lays claim to the rest.
	   The talks between the two new nuclear powers are the first after
months of tension and exchange of artillery fire in the disputed
region.
	   Both countries conducted tit-for-tat nuclear tests in May that
resulted in the imposition of economic sanctions.
	   Altaf said Kashmir was the cause of all tension and conflict in
South Asia and Pakistan wanted to settle the issue on the basis of
U.N. Security Council resolutions calling for a plebiscite in
Kashmir.
	   He said the resumption of dialogue on Kashmir was only made
possible with the support of the international community.

Schumacher gains pole position for Luxembourg GP
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Schumacher gaining pole position &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NUERBURGRING, Germany (AP) _ Michael Schumacher led a 1-2
Ferrari finish in Saturday's qualifying and gained the pole
position for the Luxembourg Grand Prix.
	   Schumacher's only rival for the Formula One title, Mika
Hakkinen, had the third fastest time in a McLaren-Mercedes and will
start Sunday's 67-lap race from the second row on the grid.
	   With two races left in the season, Hakkinen and Schumacher are
tied at 80 points in the drivers' standings.
	   Hakkinen, the ``Flying Finn,'' has a slight advantage: since he
has two second-place finishes and Schumacher only one, Hakkinen is
theoretically ahead in the tie-breaking formula.
	   The Finn can clinch his first title Sunday _ provided he wins
and Schumacher either fails to finish the race or ends up outside
the top six.
	   Starting from the second row, Hakkinen's job will be tough,
especially before 140,000 boisterous German fans rooting for
Schumacher.
	   The way the season started, Hakkinen should have by now all but
clinched the title.
	   He won the first race in Australia in March to take the lead in
the drivers' standings and he's been in No. 1 ever since, capturing
four of the first six races and six overall.
	   But Schumacher has come back strongly in his attempt to win the
first drivers' title for Ferrari since Jody Scheckter in 1979.
	   The German also has six season victories and comes off an
impressive win at Monza, Italy, two weeks ago, his second in the
last three races.
	   Schumacher feels Hakkinen should be under pressure. While
Hakkinen has never won the title, Schumacher has twice, with
Williams and Benetton, but not with Ferrari.
	   While the McLaren-Mercedes cars won five of the first six races
this year, it is the Ferraris that have been gaining in reliability
while the McLarens have been losing it.
	   In Monza, Hakkinen suffered brake problems while his teammate
David Coulthard went out with engine problems. Schumacher won and
his teammate Eddie Irvine finished second.
	   ``I am confident that we've got it under control,'' said
Mercedes boss Norbert Haug.
	   Hakkinen showed off the McLaren's power by beating Schumacher by
more than seven-tenths of a second in Friday's free practice.
	   But when it mattered, in Saturday's qualifying, it was
Schumacher who was the fastest.
	   After spinning out early in the session, Schumacher then put in
a blazing lap of one minute, 18.561 seconds on the 4.556-kilometer
(2.831-mile) circuit.
	   Hakkinen put in a desperate attempt in the final minute of the
qualifying session. While he improved slightly on his time, he was
not fast enough to overtake Schumacher and stayed .379 seconds
behind the German.
	   Schumacher's Ferrari teammate Eddie Irvine was .346 seconds
behind.

FBI returns to house where bomb could have been assembled

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ FBI agents have returned to a white
two-story house in a new development on the outskirts of Nairobi
believed to be the one rented by a suspect in the U.S. Embassy
bombing in Kenya that killed 248 people, the new tenants said
Saturday.
	   An American couple, who refused to give their names, said FBI
agents, who had already searched the house shortly after the Aug. 7
bombing, returned Thursday but were only allowed to check the yard
and the exterior of No. 43 in New Runda Estate on the northern edge
of the Kenyan capital.
	   The New York Times reported Saturday that other residents in the
estate identified the previous tenant as Haroun Fazil, one of four
suspects charged with the murder of the 12 Americans who died in
the blast.
	   According to a complaint filed Sept. 17 by the U.S. Attorney's
office in Manhattan, Fazil, a native of the Comoros Islands off
East Africa, rented the house from May to August and was later
joined by co-conspirator Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al-'Owhali.
	   No neighbors, other residents, security guards or household
employees were around Saturday to discuss the FBI visit or Fazil's
stay.
	   It was not possible to obtain comment from FBI agents in Nairobi
investigating the bombing.
	   According to the complaint, the bomb that destroyed the embassy
was built at the house rented by Fazil, who is a fugitive. He is
alleged to have driven a white pickup truck to the embassy on the
day of the bombing to show the way to the vehicle that carried the
bomb.
	   The house is about 12 kilometers (8 miles) from the embassy
building in downtown Nairobi.
	   Fazil, Al-'Owhali and Mohamed Saddiq Odeh, the other suspect
charged in the Kenyan bombing, are believed to be members of the
al-Qaeda organization founded by Saudi exile Osama bin Laden. The
latter two are in custody in New York.
	   On Friday Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, who was arrested Sept. 16 in
Germany on an Iterpol warrant, was charged in U.S. District Court
in Manhattan with murder conspiracy and use of weapons of mass
destruction in an international plot to kill U.S. citizens. He was
not charged specifically in the deaths of the Americans killed in
the Nairobi bombing.
	   In an almost simultaneous blast Aug. 7, another bomb killed 11
people, all Africans, at the U.S. Embassy in neighboring Tanzania.
	   Two suspects have been charged in the deaths and are being held
by police in Dar es Salaam.
	   Adadi Rajabu, head of criminal investigations for the Tanzanian
police, was quoted Saturday in the Swahili language daily Mtanzania
saying that police were looking for two fugitives in connection
with the bombing.
	   One of the suspects charged, Egyptian Mustafa Mahmoud Said
Ahmed, owned an import-export company in Nairobi and was reported
Aug. 18 by the independent Kenyan newspaper, Daily Nation, to have
informed the U.S. and Israeli embassies in Nairobi late last year
of planned terrorist attacks against them.
	   Sources told the newspaper the Egyptian had met bin Laden in the
mid 1980s.
	   Embassy officials have denied having prior knowledge of the
attack.

EU agrees to tie Danish, Greek currencies to euro
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; with EU-Finance &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ European Union finance ministers Saturday
backed plans by Greece and Denmark to link their currencies to the
euro after it's launched on Jan. 1 as the the shared money of 11 EU
nations.
	   In a revamped version of the EU's existing ``exchange rate
mechanism,'' the Danish krone will be allowed to fluctuate just
2.25 percent above or below a central rate against the euro.
	   The Greek drachma will given more leeway to fluctuate within
bands of 15 percent.
	   Denmark, along with Britain and Sweden, decided not to
participate in the launch of the euro which will become the common
currency of Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands,
Belgium, Portugal, Austria, Finland, Ireland and Luxembourg.
	   Greek was not allowed to join the first wave of euro-zone
nations, because of its high inflation and budget deficit.

Top UN refugee official visits Kosovo, calls for halt to violence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEKSANDAR VASOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The top U.N. official in charge of
refugees visited shell-shocked victims of the seven-month offensive
against Kosovo separatists on Saturday and urged authorities to
stop destroying villages.
	   ``I'm worried about winter,'' said Sadako Ogata, the United
Nations high commissioner for refugees. ``Time is against us and we
have to be as fast as possible.''
	   She voiced the concern of humanitarian aid organizations that
many of an estimated 50,000 refugees living in the open could grow
ill or die with the cold and lack of food in the coming winter.
	   These and more than 200,000 other refugees have fled their homes
since February, when government forces launched a crackdown on
ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for independence in Kosovo, a
Serbian province that is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.
	   After visiting about 2,000 people in a refugee camp in the
village of Resnik, 30 kilometers (18 miles) northwest of Pristina,
Ogata said about 20 of them were wounded and many children were so
traumatized they were ``almost in a coma.''
	   Shelling was heard in the distance during her visit and police
at a roadblock to the refugee camp said hundreds of guerrillas were
still close by.
	   Serb sources said seven policemen died in the continuing
offensive against hundreds of rebels holed up in the central Kosovo
region of Drenica.
	   Officials from the Serb Media Center, which releases information
from Serb authorities, said five policemen were killed Friday after
driving over a land mine, while two died in combat.
	   Police, who detained several foreign journalists Friday for
routine questioning and then released them, denied reporters access
to Resnik on Saturday, despite invitations from Ogata's agency to
accompany her.
	   Speaking to reporters Saturday, Ogata said she asked Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic while in Belgrade to halt the
destruction and cooperate with the international community to ease
the suffering of civilians.
	   ``I have told Milosevic about burning of houses and I told him
that this is unacceptable,'' Ogata said of her meeting with
Milosevic on Friday. ``He agreed, but I will have to raise that
issue again. There are no guarantees that repressive measures will
stop.''
	   Ogata was scheduled to meet later Saturday with Ibrahim Rugova,
Kosovo's top ethnic Albanian political leader. On Friday, gunmen
wounded an aide to Rugova, days after killing another associate, in
a possible attempt to warn Rugova to accept nothing short of
independence for Kosovo.
	   There have been indications that Rugova and Milosevic could sign
a U.S.-backed agreement that would give Kosovo a degree of
self-rule but would leave it part of Serbia and thus within
Yugoslavia.

Kosovo's top ethnic Albanian political leader. On Friday, gunmen
wounded an aide to Rugova, days after killing another associate, in
a possible attempt to warn Rugova to accept nothing short of
independence for Kosovo.
	   There have been indications that Rugova and Milosevic could sign
a U.S.-backed agreement that would give Kosovo a degree of
self-rule but would leave it part of Serbia and thus within
Yugoslavia as part of the Serbian republic.

	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ FBI agents have returned to a white
two-story house in a new development on the outskirts of Nairobi
believed to be the one rented by a suspect in the U.S. Embassy
bombing in Kenya that killed 248 people, the new tenants said
Saturday.
	   An American couple, who refused to give their names, said FBI
agents, who had already searched the house shortly after the Aug. 7
bombing, returned Thursday but were only allowed to check the yard
and the exterior of No. 43 in New Runda Estate on the northern edge
of the Kenyan capital.
	   The couple, who explained that they were trying to complete the
move into their new home in peace, refused further comment and
would not say who owned the house.
	   The New York Times reported Saturday that other residents in the
estate identified the previous tenant as Haroun Fazil, one of four
suspects charged with the murder of the 12 Americans who died in
the blast.
	   According to a complaint filed Sept. 17 by the U.S. Attorney's
office in Manhattan, Fazil, a native of the Comoros Islands off
East Africa, rented the house from May to August and was later
joined by co-conspirator Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al-'Owhali.
	   No neighbors, other residents, security guards or household
employees were around Saturday to discuss the FBI visit or Fazil's
stay.
	   It was not possible to obtain comment from FBI agents in Nairobi
investigating the bombing.
	   According to the complaint, the bomb that destroyed the embassy
was built at the house rented by Fazil, who is a fugitive. He is
alleged to have driven a white pickup truck to the embassy on the
day of the bombing to show the way to the vehicle that carried the
bomb.
	   The house is about 12 kilometers (8 miles) from the embassy
building in downtown Nairobi.
	   Fazil, Al-'Owhali and Mohamed Saddiq Odeh, the other suspect
charged in the Kenyan bombing, are believed to be members of the
al-Qaeda organization founded by Saudi exile Osama bin Laden. The
latter two are in custody in New York.
	   On Friday Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, who was arrested Sept. 16 in
Germany on an Iterpol warrant, was charged in U.S. District Court
in Manhattan with murder conspiracy and use of weapons of mass
destruction in an international plot to kill U.S. citizens. He was
not charged specifically in the deaths of the Americans killed in
the Nairobi bombing.
	   In an almost simultaneous blast Aug. 7, another bomb killed 11
people, all Africans, at the U.S. Embassy in neighboring Tanzania.
	   Two suspects have been charged in the deaths and are being held
by police in Dar es Salaam.
	   Adadi Rajabu, head of criminal investigations for the Tanzanian
police, was quoted Saturday in the Swahili language daily Mtanzania
saying that police were looking for two fugitives in connection
with the bombing.
	   One of the suspects charged, Egyptian Mustafa Mahmoud Said
Ahmed, owned an import-export company in Nairobi and was reported
Aug. 18 by the independent Kenyan newspaper, Daily Nation, to have
informed the U.S. and Israeli embassies in Nairobi late last year
of planned terrorist attacks against them.
	   Sources told the newspaper the Egyptian had met bin Laden in the
mid 1980s.
	   Embassy officials have denied having prior knowledge of the
attack.

 &UR; Hundreds of Lesotho soldiers turn themselves in to intervention
force &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo pending &QL; 
 &UR; By ANDREW SELSKY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ About 1,000 soldiers of the Lesotho
Defense Force obeyed an order to return to headquarters Saturday,
reducing fears the insurrection that led to South Africa's
intervention last week might worsen into a guerrilla conflict.
	   Meanwhile, the political stalemate continued, with Prime
Minister Pakalitha Mosisili _ who invited in the South African and
Botswana troops _ refusing to negotiate with opponents who claim
last May's elections were rigged. He claims they intended to
assassinate him.
	   Many residents were forced to drive or hitch rides into South
Africa, which encircles this poverty-stricken and now devastated
nation of 2 million, for groceries and supplies as stores remained
closed or ruined by vandals following Tuesday's intervention.
	   At least 14 civilians died along with 66 troops from both sides,
police commissioner Bolutu Makoaba told the South African Press
Association.
	   The toll will mount as bodies are recovered from homes and
businesses burnt in the frenzy of arson and looting that struck
outlying towns as well as the capital. ``We are presently unable to
give the final figure of people killed,'' he said.
	   The returning soldiers, most dressed in civilian clothes, were
frisked for weapons, then directed to compounds or open areas
patrolled by South African troops. They were treated warily _ as
neither rebels, nor comrades on the same side, nor prisoners of
war.
	   ``I feel more like a prisoner becase when I arrived here, I had
to fill out a prisoner of war form saying what unit I belonged
to,'' private Harari Maziboko told a reporter from the other side
of a barred mess hall window.
	   The mood, nevertheless, seemed relaxed. Some soldiers confined
with the private squatted in a corner and played dice. Most, if not
all, were expected to be allowed to leave shortly.
	   A Lesotho officer seemed conciliatory in speaking to the
soldiers. ``Store away your dignity and let's work in peace,'' he
said.
	   The South African commander, Col. Jorrie Jordaan, said it was up
to Lesotho's military to solve the insurrection issue. ``South
Africa has no part'' in that, he said.
	   The Lesothans were ordered to return to their bases Monday, in
uniform and with unloaded weapons in hand. ``Those who don't appear
will be assumed to be hard-core rebels,'' Lt. Col. Laverne Machine
said.
	   The Lesotho Defense Force has about 2,000 soldiers, Jordaan
said, so at least half showed up Saturday.
	   The intervention which was intended to bolster Lesotho's elected
government has been roundly criticized for bad planning and
execution.
	   As the economic damage was so unexpectedly severe, and the
political and military stalemates remain unresolved, it's unclear
how South Africa will extricate itself quickly and cleanly.
	   Hundreds more troops already grouped at the border were expected
to be deployed this weekend, the South African Press Association
reported Saturday.

Technician probe Spanish crash as relatives mourn victims

	   MELILLA, Spain (AP) _ As technicians sifted through wreckage to
try to discover the cause of a Spanish airline's crash in northern
Morocco, mourning relatives Saturday began reclaiming the bodies of
the 38 people killed in the accident.
	   Moroccan and Spanish experts, helped by two technicians from
British Aerospace _ the company that built the plane _ fanned out
across the rugged terrain where the BAe-146 smashed into pieces
killing all aboard Friday.
	   Meanwhile, in nearby Melilla, the tiny Spanish enclave in
northern Morocco where the plane was headed, medical teams toiled
through the night and had identified 28 of the 38 people killed by
midday Saturday.
	   Speculation as to why the 86-seater, belonging to Spanish
charter company Pauknair, crashed continued with poor visibility
being blamed by some while Spanish police chief Juan Cotino
suggested human error may have been the cause.
	   A statement from Pauknair said the plane had passed a complete
revision June 9 and added that the pilot had not reported any
technical difficulties during the flight. It added that the
approach to Melilla was complicated by mist.
	   The Melilla Hoy newspaper said morning mists were not unusual in
the area.
	   The plane, which took off from the southern Spanish port of
Malaga at 8.30 a.m. (0630 gmt), crashed 20 minutes later into a
hillside some 25 kilometers (15 miles) north of Melilla and on the
other side of a promontory from the enclave.
	   The aircraft's two black boxes were found late Friday.
	   The crash was the first involving a Spanish airline since 1985
when a Madrid-bound Iberia Airlines Boeing 727 hit a hill-top
television antenna in the northern city of Bilbao, killing 148
people.
	   The world's deadliest aviation disaster occurred on March 27,
1977 in Spain's Canary Islands when a KLM jetliner crashed into a
Pan American jumbo on the runway, killing 585 people.
	   The list of victims published Saturday in local newspapers
showed 18 were from Melilla, 10 from Malaga, one from Morocco and
the rest from other parts of Spain.
	   ``Identification of some of the bodies could take days'' said
Enrique Palacios head of the local government and mayor of Melilla.
	   The bodies were laid out in a makeshift mourning center in the
city sports pavilion with curtained-off cubicles providing some
privacy for the relatives and friends.
	   Social workers were on hand to provide emotional support.
	   ``The psychologists, everyone has been so good'' said Carmen
Coca, 44, whose sister Josefa and nephew Francisco were killed in
the crash.
	   ``But we are lucky, there are 10 of us so we help each
other,''she said as she awaited the arrival of her dead relatives.
	   Palacios announced that a special memorial service would be held
Sunday embracing the four religious cultures of this tiny enclave,
Christian, Muslim, Hindu and Jewish.
	   Echoing the resentment expressed by several residents who
complain they are often forgotten about by Spanish authorities,
Palacios said: ``We would like the King or the Prime Minister to
come (to Sunday's memorial service), but whether they do or not is
their problem.''

	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Opposition parties may have received
enough votes in national elections to oust Slovakia's authoritarian
leader from power, based on independent exit polls released after
the two-day voting ended Saturday.
	   Results from the parliamentary balloting, which officials said
appeared to have gone smoothly despite wide-spread concerns
beforehand, won't be released until late Sunday.
	   But according to exit polls conducted by two independent
agencies, a broad alliance of opposition parties apparently lived
up to expectations it would get enough support to be able to
support the next government.
	   The hardline ruling party of Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, who
is widely assailed abroad for anti-democratic practices, narrowly
topped the list of 17 parties in both exit polls. But even adding
the support of his sole likely ally in parliament, the Slovak
National Party, he would fall well short of a majority and be
significantly behind the total of four opposition parties who have
pledged to unite forces.
	   ``This is a vote for new hope and for a new beginning for
Slovakia,'' said top opposition leader Mikulas Dzurinda, head of
the Slovak Democratic Coalition, hailing the exit-poll results.

Report: Iraq arrests killers of senior Iranian cleric
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraqi authorities have captured the
assailants who assassinated a senior Shiite Iranian cleric in
southern Iraq in June, a state-owned Baghdad weekly said Saturday.
	   Al-Mustaqbal said Iraq's security forces apprehended ``the
perpetrators of the vicious murder of grand Ayatollah Mirza Ali
Gharavi'' and are investigating the motives behind the killing.
	   Gharavi, 70, his son-in-law and chauffeur were shot by gunmen as
they were driving from the Muslim Shiite holy city of Karbala to
Najaf, 100 kilometers (60 miles) southeast of the capital, Baghdad.
	   Iraq originally blamed the murder on a ``foreign party.''
	   In Iran, where the Shiite clergy hold power, officials warned
the killing could hurt relations that were improving slightly in
recent months. They demanded that Baghdad investigate the incident.
	   The magazine gave no further details on the arrests, and there
was no immediate comment from Iraqi government officials.
	   Another senior Iranian ayatollah, Murtadha Ali Mohammed Ibrahim
Borujerdi, was murdered in southern Iraq in April.
	   Shiite clergy from Iran and around the Muslim world come to
Najaf to study at its theological institutes founded centuries ago.

Zimbabwe on the defensive in first one-day international against
</HEADLINE>
India &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe (AP) _ India had Zimbabwe on the ropes for
much of the morning Saturday when they began the first of three
one-day internationals.
	   Mohamad Azharuddin's men kept the home side on the defensive and
with the score on 160-8, it seemed the match was pretty much in the
bag for the tourists at Queens Club in the second city of Bulawayo.
	   Zimbabwe lost their first wicket with 20 runs scored and their
second after a further 20. When Zimbabwe reached 99, with skipper
Alistair Campbell looking to gain the initiative, both he and Andy
Flower were removed in successive overs. Campbell's 53 came in just
41 balls and he hit nine fours.
	   But lower down, Paul Strang, fresh from a spell with
Nottinghamshire in England, and Andrew Whittall, took Zimbabwe to a
respectable 213 all out, Whittall falling to Ajit Agarkar with the
final ball of the allotted 50 overs.
	   It was Agarkar and spinner Harbhajan Singh who spearheaded the
attack for India and they claimed three wickets apiece. Singh broke
the back of Zimbabwe by winkling out Flower, Craig Evans and Craig
Wishart just at the time the home side wanted to get on with
pushing up the run rate and it was this period that gave India the
ascendancy.
	   Strang and Whittall have at least made something of a game of
it, even though their scoring rate of about 65 percent was rather
low.
	   India had won the toss and put Zimbabwe in on a placid wicket
which was not ideal for run gathering. They need to score at 4.28
runs per over to secure victory and this should be well within
their capabilities.
	   Zimbabwe were without four of their top players _ with Grant
Flower, Guy Whittall, Everton Matambanadzo and Eddo Brandes being
injured.

Former Cabinet minister criticizes party's European ballot
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Former Deputy Prime Minister Michael
Heseltine said Saturday that the Conservative Party that Europe is
not the issue which will beat the governing Labor Party.
	   He criticized Conservative leader William Hague for conducting a
referendum on the European currency in advance of the party
conference next month, saying it would only exacerbate divisions.
	   ``That's what this referendum has done, it was a self-inflicted
wound and it will not end the discussion,'' Heseltine told a party
organization, Conservative Mainstream.
	   Hague asked party members to vote on his policy of opposing
British entry into a European single currency at least through the
next Parliamentary term _ which could be as late as 2007.
	   Speaking in Manchester on Friday, Hague said his policy was
vindicated by the European Central Bank's decision not to allow
national symbols -- such as the queen's face -- on European
currency notes and its pressure on Portugal, Spain, Italy and
Ireland to cut interest rates.
	   ``It only reinforces our fears that the single currency will not
only lead to decisions on interest rates but also those on taxes
and savings being taken out of the control of the British
government,'' Hague said.
	   Bitter arguments about the single currency, and more generally
about Europe, bedeviled by the Conservative government under John
Major, which lost the 1997 general election.
	   Heseltine said the Conservatives should concentrate now on
attacking Prime Minister Tony Blair's government, not on debating
its policy in the single currency.
	   ``We have not got policies on anything else, we are not having a
referendum on anything else, and rightly so because our job is to
oppose,'' Heseltine said.
	   Heseltine said opposition to the European Union would not win
votes.
	   ``Where is the argument that moving in a Eurosceptic direction
will bring back to the Conservative party that broad swathe of
central opinion without which we will never return to power? Show
me the evidence. I do not see it and I have never been persuaded
that it exists,'' he said.

	   His party was likely the No. 1 vote-getter among opposition
parties and finished narrowly behind Meciar's HZDS, based on exit
polls by both the National Center for Media Propagation _ sponsored
by pro-government state television _ and the MVK polling agency.
	   The state TV-sponsored exit poll, based on interviews with 8,000
voters as they left polling stations Friday and Saturday, showed
HZDS with 26.9 percent support to 22.7 percent for the Slovak
Democratic Coalition.
	   The Slovak National Party had 10.5 percent, giving pro_Meciar
forces a potential 38.4 percent combined. With the coalition and
three other opposition parties added together, opposition parties
got 55 percent, according to the survey. Eleven other parties
failed a five-percent minimum required for seats in parliament.
	   The opposition figures in the other exit poll, based on MVK's
20,000 interviews at polling stations, were slightly higher, at a
combined 59.8 percent.
	   Exit polls are not always reliable but if conducted properly
give a strong indication of how the actual vote ran.
	   There was no immediate comment from Meciar's party.
	   If reliable, the exit polls show Slovakia may be headed for a
striking change after having been shunned by Western governments
and investors for it's heavy-handed practices.
	   From the Danube River in the southwest to the rugged High Tatra
Mountains in the east, Slovak voters seemed enthusiastic about the
vote _ the second since the country became independent from the
former Czechoslovakia in January 1993.
	   Pensioners, businessmen and mothers with small children in tow
flocked to polling stations in the capital Bratislava, a bustling
old industrial city where featureless concrete buildings from
communist times mingle with more graceful architecture from its
days in the Austro-Hungarian empire.
	   Pensioner Ludmila Mariaova, 74, said she voted for Meciar's
ruling party because she trusted him.
	   But many younger, more urban Slovaks back the opposition and are
fed up with the policies of the ruling party, which they perceive
as anti-democratic and benefiting only the owners of Slovakia's
newly privatized industries.

	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Australian fast bowlers Glenn McGrath
and Michael Kasprowicz reduced Pakistan to 192 for five on the
second day of the four-day match in Karachi on Saturday.
	   Captain Aamir Sohail, who demoted himself down the order and
came to bat at No. 7, was still there on 11 at the end of the day.
Faisal Iqbal was together with Sohail unbeaten on 20.
	   McGrath ended the day with 2-42 while Kasprowicz had 2-56.
	   Earlier, the visitors declared their first innings at an
imposing total of 540 for nine, adding another brisk 102 runs
before lunch to their first day's 438 for five.
	   McGrath, who missed the Commonwealth Games cricket tournament in
Kuala Lumpur last week due to groin injury, and Kasprowicz polished
off the top order Pakistan batsmen and at one stage the home team
was struggling at 67 for three.
	   McGrath took the wickets of openers Suleman Huda (6) and
hard-hitting one-day International sensation Shahid Afridi (34 off
35 balls), neatly caught by Ricky Ponting at point.
	   Youngest Test cricketer Hasan Raza, who made his Test debut
against Zimbabwe during the 1996-97 season, and Azam Khan briefly
revived Pakistan's position with a 83-run fourth effort before
leg-spinner Stuart MacGill had Raza stumped by Healy for 29.
	   Raza, who scored his first runs after facing 24 deliveries
lifted off-spinner Gavin Robertson to mid-off for a big six during
his 96-ball innings.
	   Khan, who settled down after some anxious moments early in his
innings, stroked nine fours in his half century. However, Khan
miscued a pull off Kasprowicz short delivery and was caught by
Justin Langer at square leg off.
	   Earlier, Ponting's 52 enabled Australia to score quickly after
it resumed at the overnight total of 438 for five. Robertson made
24 with the help of three boundaries while Kasprowicz remained
unbeaten on 10 as Taylor declared the first innings at the stroke
of lunch with Australia happily placed at 540 for nine.
	   Ali Hussiain Rizvi was the pick of Pakistan's bowlers. The
leg-spinner, who bowled 43 overs, conceded 161 runs for his four
wickets which included the scalps of Robertson and Ponting. Medium
fast Ali Gohar captured 3-74 while Afridi returned with the figures
of 2-104 off his 30 overs.

Telecom Italia agrees to Murdoch as potential partner in pay TV
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to CORRECT reference to Murdoch's
nationality, TRIM. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Telecom Italia has agreed to pursue Rupert
Murdoch as a partner in the development of digital TV in Italy,
despite strong political opposition.
	   Telecommunications officials have spoken of a ``colonization''
of Italian television if the Australian media magnate is allowed
into the country's pay-TV market.
	   On Friday, its board authorized Telecom Italia to work with RAI
state television in an accord on digital TV, and singled out
British Sky Broadcasting Group as a good potential partner for
them.
	   The British company is 40 percent owned by Murdoch's News Corp.
	   If negotiations don't conclude by Oct. 5, Telecom is free to
pursue other solutions on its own, the company said.
	   RAI board member Alberto Conti said Thursday that the state TV
company was likely to agree to an alliance with News Corp. _ on
condition that Italians keep an absolute majority, and that Murdoch
confine himself only to pay TV in Italy.
	   Some analysts say Murdoch's presence would be a plus for Telecom
Italia and the market as a whole. His aggressiveness and the
heightened competition could boost the size and development of the
Italian digital television market, they contend.

Workers at Ukraine's nuclear power plants protest over unpaid

wages &QL;

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) - Employees at Ukraine's five nuclear power
plants staged protests Saturday to dramatize their demands for
payment of overdue wages.
	   Demonstrations began at midday at the satellite cities built
near the nuclear facilities for plant employees, the ITAR-Tass news
agency said.
	   However, the nuclear plants were operating normally. Organizers
have said their protest was not intended to hamper the plants'
work.
	   The protests took place in spite of the government's pledge on
Friday to disburse 63 million hryvna (dlrs 19 million) for the
nuclear facilities to pay off delayed wages.
	   Although Ukraine's nuclear power sector accounts for about half
of all electricity produced in the former Soviet republic, the
nuclear power plants, which are owed tremendous sums for
electricity they have supplied, can barely make ends meet.
	   Danko Bilei, who heads Europe's largest nuclear plant,
Zaporizhia, complained Friday that the money his plant receives is
just enough to ``pay taxes and fines for overdue taxes.''
	   The situation is not much better at the Yuzhnaia plant, where
employees have not been paid for five months. Plant officials have
said that up to two-thirds of what the state owes them has already
been lost because of a recent sharp devaluation of the national
currency in response to the turmoil in neighboring Russia.
	   Ukraine's nuclear power plants purchase equipment and fuel
mostly from Russia. But with the continuing devaluation of the
hryvna, which fell 45 percent over the previous month, the imports,
paid in U.S. dollars, have already become much more expensive for
Ukraine's nuclear sector.
	   The rallies were expected to move to Kiev on Monday, when about
500 representatives from all nuclear power plants are expected to
demonstrate in front of the Cabinet headquarters. Employees from
Ukraine's uranium-processing plants, who have also gone for months
without pay, are planning to join the demonstration.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Takuro Ishii hit a tie-breaking two-run homer in
the top of the seventh inning Saturday as the Central League's
front-running Yokohama BayStars beat the Hiroshima Toyo Carp 5-3.
	   Takahiro Saeki arched a two-run shot, knotting the game 2-2 in
the second. Saiki has eight homers this season, and Ishii six.
	   At Tokyo Dome, Daisuke Motoki cracked a two-run homer in the
bottom of the third as the Yomiuri Giants shutout the Yakult
Swallows 5-0.
	   Toshihisa Nishi drove in two runs on a double, and Hideki Matsui
batted in another run on a single in the six to widen the lead.
	   Giants' starter Masaki Saito gave up three hits, while striking
out five and walking two in eight innings to collect his 10th
victory against seven defeats.
	   The Giants are now 1 1/2 games behind the second-place Chunichi
Dragons.
	   Agame between the Dragons and Hanshin Tigers was rained out.
	   In the Pacific League, Yukio Tanaka batted in three runs on a
bases-loaded double in the top of the third inning, giving the
Nippon Ham fighters a 8-1 victory over the Chiba Lotte Marines at
Chiba.
	   In all, the Fighters had 15 hits while starter Kip Gross (3-2),
formerly of the Los Angeles Dodgers, threw a four-hitter and struck
out one in six innings to snap the club's three-game losing streak.
	   The Fighters are now a 1/2 game behind the first-place Seibu
Lions, whose game against the Kintetsu Buffaloes was rained out.
	   In Kobe, Chris Donnels, Troy Neel and Yasuo Fujii connected for
solo homers, boosting the Orix BlueWave to a 5-0 victory over the
Fukuoka Daiei Hawks.
	   Fujii has 30 homers this season. Neel, formerly of the Oakland
Athletics, has 25 homers and Donnels, formerly of Boston Red Sox,
has five.
	   The loss was the second in a row for the Hawks, who slipped to
fourth place in the league.

Ukrainian president leaves for Crimean meeting with Polish leader
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ President Leonid Kuchma left on Saturday
for Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula where he is to meet with his
Polish counterpart Alexander Kwasniewski.
	   Kwasniewski and Kuchma will hold closed-doors talks Sunday,
followed by more meetings Monday at Kuchma's Crimean residence,
officials said.
	   The two leaders last met in June in the northeastern Ukrainian
town of Kharkiv, where they laid the foundation stone for a
memorial to Poles killed by Soviet secret police.
	   The talks in Crimea are expected to focus on economic
cooperation and border policies, such as the possible introduction
of visas for Ukrainians who travel to Poland. These questions
already were discussed in Kiev last week during a visit by Polish
Foreign Minister Bronislaw Geremek.
	   In mid-November, Kuchma is due to visit Warsaw for Poland's
independence anniversary celebrations.

Iran promises to produce longer-range missiles

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran will develop a new missile that will
outdistance its predecessor, which is already capable of striking
Israel, Iranian Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani said Saturday.
	   Iran unveiled the Shahab-3 missile during a military parade
Friday. The newly developed weapon has a range of 1,300 kilometers
(800 miles), which means it can hit Saudi Arabia and Israel.
	   ``Certainly we will work on the development of the Shahab-4 and
5, but this does not mean we will start tomorrow,'' he said.
	   In July, Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Martin Indyk said
Iran was working on the Shahab-4, which he called a greater threat
than its predecessor. He said the missile could be deployed in two
to five years and pledged that the United States would redouble its
efforts to curb the transfer of technology Iran needs to develop
it.
	   Iran is believed to have received substantial missile technology
from Russia and some from China and North Korea. The Shahab-3 is
believed to be based on North Korea's No Dong ballistic missile.
	   Shamkhani, a Navy rear admiral, denied at a news conference that
Iran had received help in developing the missiles.
	   Shamkhani said Iran would strike back at Israel if the Jewish
state attacked its nuclear plant in the southern town of Bushehr.
	   ``We'll certainly respond firmly to any Israeli attack or
aggression in a manner more severe than one can imagine, and we
have the capability. The most obvious, but only the minimum, is the
Shahab-3,'' Shamkhani said.
	   Shamkhani would not say how many missiles Iran possessed, but
indicated that Iran could produce as many as it needed.
	   Iran says the Shahab-3 can carry a one-ton warhead at a cruising
altitude of 250 kilometers (155 miles) above sea level.
	   U.S. and Israeli officials have expressed concern about the
missile because it can hit Israel and U.S. troops stationed in
Saudi Arabia. Iranian officials have said the missile is only for
defense and that they are free to strengthen their armed forces.
	   Iran had virtually no arms industry under the U.S.-supported
shah because Washington supplied nearly all Iran's defense needs.
The shah was ousted during the 1979 Islamic revolution.
	   In other developments, Shamkhani said military exercises near
the Afghan border will start within a week. The exercises, in which
more than 200,000 soldiers will participate, come amid growing
demands for vengeance against the Taliban by Iranians. Iran has
tens of thousands of troops near the border, and the Taliban says
it has moved 20,000 troops to the border to defend itself.
	   Tensions have risen since the Taliban overran the city of
Mazar-e-Sharif in northern Afghanistan Aug. 8, killing nine Iranian
diplomats posted there and an Iranian journalist.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Jonas Bjorkman and Nicklas Kulti won
Saturday's doubles match against Spain to give Sweden an unbeatable
3-0 lead in their Davis Cup semifinal.
	   Bjorkman and Kulti were never challenged by Spaniards Javier
Sanchez and Julian Alonso, winning in straight sets 6-2, 6-2, 6-2
before a sellout crowd at the Royal Tennis Hall.
	   The Swedes were never broken during the match that lasted only 1
hour, 17 minutes. Sanchez, the oldest player on the Spanish team,
dropped his serve four times. Alonso was broken twice.
	   Sweden, the defending champion, will play the winner between the
United States and Italy in the Dec. 4-6 final. Italy leads 2-0
after Friday's singles matches in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
	   Sweden has played 11 finals since its first victory at the Royal
Tennis Hall in 1975, when Bjorn Borg anchored the team. With its
six wins and five runners-up finishes, Sweden is the most
successful Davis Cup nation in the last two decades.
	   Last year, Sweden shut out the United States, led by Pete
Sampras, 5-0 in the final at Goteborg, Sweden.
	   Spain reached two Davis Cup finals in the 1960s, but never won
the competition.

 &UR; Eds: Contains items on Jordan, Kuwait. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ A joint Jordanian-Kuwaiti trade fair opened
in Amman on Saturday in the first such exposition since relations
soured during the 1990-91 Gulf crisis over Kuwait.
	   More than 50 Jordanian and 35 Kuwaiti firms are displaying
industrial goods _ such as foodstuffs, plastics, petrochemicals and
textiles _ in the fair, which ends Oct. 2.
	   ``The exhibition is a sign of Jordanian and Kuwaiti eagerness to
restore trade ties,'' said Walid Khatib, director of the Jordan
Chamber of Industry.
	   Trade with Kuwait came to a standstill eight years ago because
of Jordan's perceived tilt toward Iraq in the aftermath of the
August 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   Jordan says Kuwait is now responding to Jordanian overtures to
improve ties. Last year, Kuwait reopened direct phone lines with
Jordan, and this year it allowed the resumption of commercial
flights between the two countries.
	   Jordanian exports to Kuwait amounted to 29 million Jordanian
dinars (dlrs 40.8 million) last year. Jordanian exports to Kuwait
included limestone, fruits, vegetables, and textiles. Imports were
mainly foodstuffs and petrochemicals.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The government plans stringent measures to
fight high unemployment, but there is no set mechanism yet,
Jordanian Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh said Saturday.
	   He told reporters that no accurate statistics were available on
unemployment in Jordan, which is officially estimated at 14.4
percent of the 950,000-strong labor force. Unofficial estimates are
twice that figure.
	   Tarawneh said unemployment even existed among foreign workers,
who are estimated at more than 300,000 _ the bulk of them Egyptians
and many without work permits.
	   One suggestion, he said, was to curb the inflow of foreign
workers, gradually replace those here with Jordanians and ban
hiring foreigners in certain unskilled jobs.
	   Another plan is to provide vocational training for army recruits
and school graduates to prepare them for skilled professions, he
added.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Combined assets of local banks were 12.72 billion
dinars (dlrs 41.56 billion) in August, down 149 million dinars
(dlrs 486.92 million) from the month before, the Kuwait News Agency
reported Saturday.
	   The state-run KUNA was quoting a monthly report by the Central
Bank of Kuwait.
	   This small, oil-rich state has six commercial banks, two
specialized ones and one Islamic banking institution.
	   The assets of the Central Bank also fell by 86.7 million dinars
(dlrs 283.33 million) in August, reaching 1.10 billion dinars (dlrs
3.59 billion).
	   The report did not offer any explanations.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Police beat up protesters and used
tear gas and a water cannon Saturday to break up a gathering in
downtown Kuala Lumpur of supporters of ousted deputy prime minister
Anwar Ibrahim.
	   There were no immediate reports of serious injuries, but
eyewitnesses saw policemen nab people from among the protesters and
kick them. Some were taken to parked police trucks and beaten.
	   Police also arrested dozens of people for shouting pro-Anwar
slogans or waving posters. There was no immediate comment from the
authorities on the violence.
	   Later, city authorities announced that Independence Square, the
site of many recent demonstrations, will be closed to the public
for one week.
	   Such protests, until recently unheard of in Malaysia, are fast
becoming routine. They started after Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad fired Anwar on Sept. 2 and escalated after his arrest
Sunday under a security provision.
	   Anwar is accused of various crimes, including unlawful sex acts,
and leaking state secrets. He has denied the charges, saying they
were politically motivated. Anwar has said his only fault was
challenging Mahathir's 17-year-reign.
	   Standing along barricades, thousands of people shouted ``Reform,
reform'' and ``Allah O Akbar'' as police cordoned off the capital's
historic Independence Square in a bid to prevent supporters from
holding the latest rally.
	   Several thousand activists gathered even though police had
blocked all roads leading to the square, where Malaysia's
independence from British colonialists was proclaimed in 1957.
	   Activists who had gathered near mosques shouting ``Long live
Anwar'' were dispersed by policemen on horseback and riot guards
armed with batons, shields and tear gas. They regrouped quickly at
a different spot.
	   Police chased protesters through alleys and fired tear gas to
disperse one group near a commuter railroad station, the national
news agency Bernama reported.
	   Pro-democracy activists had scheduled protests at three nearby
mosques. Police feared that activists would march to the square in
a repeat of last Sunday's mammoth rally after which Anwar was
arrested.
	   Shopkeepers pulled down their shutters in some adjoining areas
in anticipation of violence as the police moved in earlier on
Saturday.
	   Soon after Anwar's arrest, police ordered his wife to stop
making public statements or face the same fate as her husband.
Malaysians face arrest for organizing pro-reform protests.
	   At least 16 people, many of them governing party members who
backed Anwar, are in jail under the Internal Security Act, a
British colonial law that allows for imprisonment without trial.
	   The London-based human rights group, Amnesty International,
Friday labeled Anwar and the others detained under ISA as
``prisoners of conscience'' and accused Mahathir of ``contravening
international legal standards.''
	   Anwar has not been seen since he was marched off by masked riot
policemen on Sunday. Police have not responded to repeated requests
for information about him.

Exit polls show opposition fared well in Slovakia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with polls closed, exit poll
results show ruling party narrowly ahead, but opposition in
position to win combined majority of seats. Preliminary results
expected Sunday. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Opposition parties may have received
enough votes in national elections to oust Slovakia's authoritarian
leader, based on independent exit polls released after the two-day
voting ended Saturday.
	   Results from the parliamentary balloting, which officials said
appeared to have gone smoothly despite widespread concerns
beforehand, won't be released until late Sunday.
	   But according to exit polls conducted by two agencies, a broad
alliance of opposition parties apparently lived up to expectations
that it would get enough votes to be able to support the next
government.
	   The ruling party of Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, who is
widely assailed abroad for anti-democratic practices, narrowly
topped the list of 17 parties in both exit polls. But even adding
the support of his sole likely ally in parliament, the Slovak
National Party, he would fall well short of a majority and be
significantly behind the total of four opposition parties who have
pledged to unite forces.
	   ``This is a vote for new hope and for a new beginning for
Slovakia,'' said top opposition leader Mikulas Dzurinda, head of
the Slovak Democratic Coalition.
	   His party was probably the No. 1 vote-getter among opposition
parties, finishing narrowly behind Meciar's HZDS based on exit
polls by the independent MVK polling agency and the National Center
for Media Propagation, which is sponsored by pro-government state
television.
	   The state TV-sponsored exit poll, based on interviews with 8,000
voters as they left polling stations Friday and Saturday, showed
HZDS with 27 percent support to 23 percent for the Slovak
Democratic Coalition.
	   The Slovak National Party had 11 percent, giving pro-Meciar
forces a potential 38 percent combined. With the coalition and
three other opposition parties added together, opposition parties
got 55 percent, according to the survey. Eleven other parties
failed to get the 5 percent minimum required for seats in
parliament.
	   The opposition figures in the other exit poll, based on MVK's
20,000 interviews at polling stations, were slightly higher, at a
combined 60 percent.
	   Exit polls are not always reliable but if conducted properly
give a strong indication of how the actual vote ran.
	   There was no immediate comment from Meciar's party.
	   If reliable, the exit polls show Slovakia may be headed for a
striking change after having been shunned by Western governments
and investors for its heavy-handed practices.
	   From the Danube River in the southwest to the rugged High Tatra
Mountains in the east, Slovak voters seemed enthusiastic about the
vote _ the second since the country became independent from the
former Czechoslovakia in January 1993.
	   Pensioners, businessmen and mothers with small children in tow
flocked to polling stations in the capital, Bratislava, a bustling
old industrial city where featureless concrete buildings from
communist times are interspersed with more graceful architecture
from its days in the Austro-Hungarian empire.
	   Pensioner Ludmila Mariaova, 74, said she voted for Meciar's
ruling party because she trusted him.
	   But many younger, more urban Slovaks back the opposition and are
fed up with the policies of the ruling party, which they perceive
as anti-democratic and benefiting only the owners of Slovakia's
newly privatized industries.

alliance of opposition parties apparently lived up to expectations
it would get enough support to be able to support the next
government.
	   The hardline ruling party of Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, who
is widely assailed abroad for anti-democratic practices, narrowly
topped the list of 17 parties in both exit polls. But even adding
the support of his sole likely ally in parliament, the Slovak
National Party, he would fall well short of a majority and be
significantly behind the total of four opposition parties who have
pledged to unite forces.
	   ``This is a vote for new hope and for a new beginning for
Slovakia,'' said top opposition leader Mikulas Dzurinda, head of
the Slovak Democratic Coalition, hailing the exit-poll results.
	   His party was likely the No. 1 vote-getter among opposition
parties and finished narrowly behind Meciar's HZDS, based on exit
polls by both the National Center for Media Propagation _ sponsored
by pro-government state television _ and the MVK polling agency.
	   The state TV-sponsored exit poll, based on interviews with 8,000
voters as they left polling stations Friday and Saturday, showed
HZDS with 26.9 percent support to 22.7 percent for the Slovak
Democratic Coalition.
	   The Slovak National Party had 10.5 percent, giving pro_Meciar
forces a potential 38.4 percent combined. With the coalition and
three other opposition parties added together, opposition parties
got 55 percent, according to the survey. Eleven other parties
failed a five-percent minimum required for seats in parliament.
	   The opposition figures in the other exit poll, based on MVK's
20,000 interviews at polling stations, were slightly higher, at a
combined 59.8 percent.
	   Exit polls are not always reliable but if conducted properly
give a strong indication of how the actual vote ran.
	   There was no immediate comment from Meciar's party.
	   If reliable, the exit polls show Slovakia may be headed for a
striking change after having been shunned by Western governments
and investors for it's heavy-handed practices.
	   From the Danube River in the southwest to the rugged High Tatra
Mountains in the east, Slovak voters seemed enthusiastic about the
vote _ the second since the country became independent from the
former Czechoslovakia in January 1993.
	   Pensioners, businessmen and mothers with small children in tow
flocked to polling stations in the capital Bratislava, a bustling
old industrial city where featureless concrete buildings from
communist times mingle with more graceful architecture from its
days in the Austro-Hungarian empire.
	   Pensioner Ludmila Mariaova, 74, said she voted for Meciar's
ruling party because she trusted him.
	   But many younger, more urban Slovaks back the opposition and are
fed up with the policies of the ruling party, which they perceive
as anti-democratic and benefiting only the owners of Slovakia's
newly privatized industries.

Natural gas deposit found off Azov Sea shores
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ A natural gas deposit discovered this week
off the Azov Sea shore would be able to provide for most of the gas
needs of eastern Crimea in Ukraine, officials said Saturday.
	   The Northern Kazantip deposit was found Thursday 20 kilometers
(12 miles) off the east coast of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula and is
expected to yield some 700 million cubic meters (24.7 billion cubic
feet) of natural gas a year, covering about 73 percent of the
region's needs, said Mykola Ilnytsky, chief of the state-run
Chornomornaftogaz company.
	   Ilnytsky told the Interfax news agency that three other offshore
areas may also prove to have gas deposits. If these expectations
come through, the four deposits might yield up to 1.5 billion cubic
meters (52.9 billion cubic feet) of natural gas a year, thus fully
covering Crimea's needs, he said.
	   The discovery also has some political significance. Ilnytsky
said the new deposits would ``serve as an additional argument in
the fight for Ukrainian interests'' as Kiev negotiates with Moscow
over the legal status of the Azov Sea and sea borders.

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) - David Rikl and Jiri Novak
outclassed Wayne Ferreira and Piet Norval in straight sets in a
Davis Cup World Group doubles tie Saturday, giving the Czech
Republic a 3-0 lead over South Africa.
	   The Czech Republic dominated throughout the match, capitalizing
especially on Rikl's powerful serve and effective net play.
	   The Czechs broke Norval's serve in the ninth game, winning the
first set 6-4 in 33 minutes.
	   The unsteady South Africans made a number of unforced errors and
lost their serve again two games later. Rikl and Novak, doubles
specialists who've won two ATP tournaments this year, then turned
the match into a walkover and crushed their opponents 6-2 in the
second set.
	   The third set had the same scenario, with the Czechs again
breaking the South Africans' serve in the first game. Ferreira and
Norval briefly rebounded in the fourth game by stealing the Czechs'
serve, but Rikl played several text-book returns in the following
game and the Czechs managed to rebreak, eventually winning the set
6-2.
	   ``We outplayed the South Africans in all respects,'' Novak said
after the match. ``The first set decided the match, the opponents
grew nervous and we steamrolled over them.''
	   The Czech Republic secured a berth in the elite 16-team World
Group for the next year, while South Africans were relegated.

Police use water cannon to break up pro-Anwar demonstration

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Police beat up protesters and used
a water cannon Saturday to break up a huge gathering in downtown
Kuala Lumpur of supporters of ousted deputy prime minister Anwar
Ibrahim.
	   There were no immediate reports of serious injuries, but
eyewitnesses saw policemen nab people from among the protesters and
kick them. Some were taken to parked police trucks and beaten.
	   Police also arrested dozens of people for shouting pro-Anwar
slogans or waving posters. There was no immediate comment from
authorities on the violence.
	   Later, city authorities announced that the Independence Square,
the site of many recent demonstrations, will be closed to the
public for one week.
	   Public protests, until recently unheard of in Malaysia, are fast
becoming routine. They started after Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad fired Anwar on Sept. 2 and escalated after his arrest
Sunday under a security provision.
	   Anwar is accused of various crimes, including unlawful sex acts,
and leaking state secrets. He has denied the charges, saying they
were politically motivated. Anwar has said his only fault was
challenging Mahathir's 17-year-reign.
	   Standing along barricades, thousands of people shouted ``Reform,
reform'' and ``Allah O Akbar'' as police cordoned off the capital's
historic Independence Square in a bid to prevent supporters from
holding the latest rally.
	   Several thousand activists gathered even though police had
blocked all roads leading to the Merdeka Square, where Malaysia's
independence from British colonialists was proclaimed in 1957.
	   Activists who had gathered near mosques shouting ``Long live
Anwar'' were dispersed by policemen on horseback and riot guards
armed with batons, shields and tear gas. They regrouped quickly at
a different spot.
	   Police chased protesters through alleys and fired tear gas to
disperse one group near a commuter railroad station, the national
news agency Bernama reported Friday evening.
	   Bernama, the official government news agency, later revised its
report with police denying the use of tear gas.
	   Pro-democracy activists had scheduled protests at three mosques
nearby in the heart of the city. Police feared that activists would
march to the square in a repeat of last Sunday's mammoth rally
after which Anwar was arrested.
	   Shopkeepers pulled down their shutters in some adjoining areas
in anticipation of violence as the police moved in earlier on
Saturday.
	   Soon after Anwar's arrest, police ordered his wife to stop
making public statements or face the same fate as her husband.
Malaysians face arrest for organizing pro-reform protests.
	   At least 16 people, many of them governing party members who
backed Anwar, are in jail under the Internal Security Act, a
British colonial law that allows for imprisonment without trial.
	   The London-based human rights group, Amnesty International,
Friday labeled Anwar and the others detained under ISA as
``prisoners of conscience'' and accused Mahathir of ``contravening
international legal standards.''
	   Anwar has not been seen since he was marched off by masked riot
policemen on Sunday. Police have not responded to repeated requests
for information about him.

Schumacher gains pole position for Luxembourg GP
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes, details &QL; 
 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NUERBURGRING, Germany (AP) _ Michael Schumacher kept up the heat
on Mika Hakkinen in their battle for the Formula One championship
when he gained the pole position for the Luxembourg Grand Prix in
Saturday's qualifying.
	   Schumacher and his Ferrari teammate Eddie Irvine will start from
the front row in Sunday's 67-lap race, while Hakkinen will be in
the second row in his McLaren-Mercedes, after posting the
third-fastest time in the qualifying.
	   Hakkinen, seeking his first title, has been in the lead in the
drivers' standings since winning the opening race of the season, in
March in Australia.
	   But Schumacher has bounced back in the second half of the season
and caught with the Finn two weeks ago by winning the Italian Grand
Prix in Monza.
	   Both drivers have 80 points and six victories each, with two
races left in the season.
	   ``It's a nice situation for us,'' Schumacher said. ``It's a good
time in the season to be in the front.''
	   Hakkinen can clinch the title Sunday _ provided he wins and
Schumacher either fails to finish the race or ends up outside the
top six. The Finn is ahead in the tie-breaking formula because he
has two second-place finishes and Schumacher only one.
	   But beating Schumacher in front of 140,000 boisterous German
fans after starting from behind will not be easy.
	   Schumacher can botch his starts, however. In Monza, he also
started from the pole but dropped behind before coming back to win.
	   ``I've had some practice since then and I think I've sorted it
out,'' Schumacher said.
	   After spinning into the grass early in the qualifying session,
Schumacher then returned to put in a blazing lap of one minute,
18.561 seconds on the 4.556-kilometer (2.831-mile) circuit.
	   ``I just went into the corner a bit too fast, nothing special
really,'' Schumacher said after gaining his second pole position of
the season and his 19th overall.
	   Irvine was .346 seconds behind to notch the best starting-grid
position of his career. The Irishman finished second in Monza in a
complete Ferrari home triumph.
	   ``The McLaren obviously underperformed and I got the most of my
car and myself,'' Irvine said.
	   Schumacher, winner of two of the last three races, was delighted
by Irvine's performance.
	   ``It's better having Eddie next to me than anyone else,'' the
German said.
	   Ferrari has not had both cars on the front row since the 1995
Belgian Grand Prix.
	   Hakkinen put in a desperate attempt in the final minute of the
qualifying session. While he improved slightly on his time, he was
not fast enough to overtake Schumacher and stayed .379 seconds
behind the German.
	   ``I am surprised,'' Hakkinen said. ``It didn't go as well as we
expected. The balance of the car was not quite right in some
corners and I was not able to carry the speed into some sections of
the lap.''
	   ``I am still confident for the race, we have time to improve the
car and tomorrow is another day,'' he said.
	   After winning five of the first six races of the season, the
McLarens have experienced reliability problems in recent races. In
Monza, Hakkinen was slowed by a brake problem, while David
Coulthard was forced to retire with engine trouble.
	   And Coulthard only managed fifth place in Saturday's qualifying,
behind the Benetton of Giancarlo Fisichella.
	   Schumacher, winner of the Formula One championship in 1994 with
Williams and 1995 with Benetton, is trying to become the first
Ferrari driver to clinch the title since Jody Scheckter in 1979.
	   Born less than an hour's drive away in Kerpen, Schumacher won on
this circuit in 1995.
	   He could have another factor in his favor Sunday: the weather.
There is a good chance of rain and Schumacher is a master driver in
wet conditions.
	   Although officially called the Luxembourg Grand Prix, the race
across the border in Germany.

Italians on verge of historic upset
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Sweden advancing to final &QL; 
 &UR; By ARNIE STAPLETON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) _ A slow court could mean a quick exit for the
Americans in the Davis Cup semifinal against Italy.
	   The U.S. team must win in doubles to avoid a stunning sweep by
the Italians, who lost just one set Friday.
	   Todd Martin, who struggled with his first serve and Davide
Sanguinetti's consistent returns, and Davis Cup rookie Justin
Gimelstob take on Andrea Gaudenzi and Diego Nargiso at the
Milwaukee Arena this afternoon.
	   The winner of this series, will play Sweden in the final Dec.
4-6. The Swedes won their semifinal against Spain by capturing the
doubles today.
	   Gaudenzi and Nargiso have seen a 2-0 lead crumble before. They
were on the team that lost to France in 1996 after winning the
first two matches.
	   But the Americans haven't overcome such a big deficit in 64
years.
	   ``We just have to go out there and play a good doubles match and
get one point, get on the board,'' U.S. captain Tom Gullikson said.
``Come back Sunday and kind of have a reversal of today's fortunes
and maybe win a few tiebreakers.''
	   The Americans lost all four tiebreakers Friday, two of them 7-0.
	   ``It is hard to win a tiebreaker when you don't win a point,''
Gullikson said.
	   And it's hard to win a Davis Cup when you don't have veterans.
	   The United States sure could have used Pete Sampras, Andre
Agassi, Michael Chang or Jim Courier on Friday.
	   Along with a faster surface.
	   Jan-Michael Gambill lost his Davis Cup debut to Gaudenzi, and
Martin, the veteran American holdover, was upset by Sanguinetti in
three sets.
	   Gambill and Martin are both fast-court players, but the indoor
court, a carpeted surface with a polyurethane coating known as
``Plexi-pave Supreme,'' played more like the clay courts the
Italians grew up on.
	   ``It was slow,'' Sanguinetti said with a smile.
	   And that played into the Italians' strengths, producing long
baseline rallies that made it harder for Martin to approach the net
and sapping some of Gambill's strong serves.
	   ``We both lost to a couple of more or less counter-punchers and
it shows that, one, they executed better than we did, and two, the
conditions were a little bit slower than we would have liked,''
Martin said.
	   Sanguinetti, ranked 47th, beat the 28th-ranked Martin 7-6 (7-0),
6-3, 7-6 (10-8), putting the Italians on the verge of a huge upset.
	   The United States is 1-27 when down 2-0. The only time the
Americans have ever overcame such a deficit in the Davis Cup was in
1934, when they rallied to defeat Australia in Britain.
	   The Americans' homecourt winning streak of 18 Davis Cup matches
is in jeopardy, too. They last lost in the United States in 1987
when Boris Becker led West Germany to a 3-2 victory in Hartford,
Conn.
	   If they can avoid the sweep, the singles pairings are reversed
Sunday, and Gullikson said he had no plans to play the rusty
Courier.
	   Agassi, Sampras and Chang all decided against coming to
Milwaukee, and Courier was withheld by Gullikson because he's not
match-ready with lingering muscle fatigue in his right biceps.
	   The Americans' youth showed in singles.
	   ``I was a little nervous and stupid,'' Gambill, 21, said after
Gaudenzi beat him 6-2, 0-6, 7-6 (7-0), 7-6 (7-4).
	   Gambill, who has risen from 227th to 50th in the world rankings,
said this loss hurt worst than his U.S. Open defeat to French Open
champion Carlos Moya in a third-round, fifth-set tiebreaker.
	   ``Even though I had a great chance there, this is far more
disappointing in my mind,'' Gambill said. ``I am playing for more
than just myself.''
	   In Stockholm, the Swedes took an unbeatable 3-0 lead today when
Jonas Bjorkman and Nicklas Kulti defeated Javier Sanchez and Julian
Alonso 6-2, 6-2, 6-2.
	   In Friday's singles, Thomas Johansson made his Davis Cup debut
and beat Carlos Moya 7-5, 7-6 (7-4), 7-6 (8-6). In the opening
match, Bjorkman downed Alex Corretja 6-3, 7-5, 6-7 (5-7), 6-3.
	   Sweden has played 11 Davis Cup finals since its first victory in
1975, when Bjorn Borg anchored the team. With six wins and five
runner-up finishes, Sweden is the most successful Davis Cup nation
the last two decades.

Ruling Party, opposition hammer out compromise on bank bills
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS with parties agreeing on other components of bank
bill, Obuchi comment

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's ruling and opposition parties have agreed
on the fate of the ailing Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan and
reached compromises on other components of crucial banking bills,
news reports said Saturday.
	   The governing Liberal Democratic Party met overnight Friday and
again Saturday with the opposition Democratic Party and the Heiwa
Kaikaku Party to smooth out differences on bills aimed at cleaning
up bad debt in Japan's banking system.
	   On Friday, they agreed that the government would acquire all the
shares of LTCB, one of Japan's biggest lenders, effectively placing
it under state control, the Nihon Keizai financial newspaper said.
	   A proposed merger between LTCB and Sumitomo Trust and Banking
Co. could still go through if Sumitomo purchased the shares from
the government and made LTCB a subsidiary, the Nihon Keizai said.
	   On Saturday, the two sides decided to postpone a decision on the
last remaining point of contention in the package of bills, Kyodo
news agency reported.
	   The parties agreed that the Finance Ministry would be stripped
of its power to deal with troubled banks but postponed a decision
on removing the ministry's broader powers to regulate the financial
sector, Kyodo said.
	   Opposition parties wanted the ministry's regulatory powers
transferred to an independent body by June 30, 1999, but the ruling
party has resisted setting a deadline.
	   Still, Saturday's agreement appeared to clear the way for the
broader bank crisis plan to be put into action.
	   ``I'm glad we can finally see where the financial system is
headed. Now I want to see the bills approved as soon as possible,''
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi was quoted as saying by Kyodo.
	   Japan is under mounting pressure both at home and abroad to pass
legislation that would help clean up as much as dlrs 1 trillion
worth of bad loans at Japanese banks and restore health the
financial system.
	   But the opposition, which controls the upper house of
Parliament, has been blocking the government proposal and pressing
the ruling party to accept a rival version of the legislation.
	   Last week, the two sides reached a basic agreement on the bills
that appeared to absorb the key points of the opposition demands.
But the accord was worded vaguely and renewed bickering erupted
when the LDP and its adversaries came up with different
interpretations of the pact.

Sanchez-Vicaro, Seles advance to final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS throughout; CORRECTS typo in byline &QL; 
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ One moment, Anke Huber thought she was cruising
toward the final of the Toyota Princess Cup, with opponent Arantxa
Sanchez-Vicario injured and unable to resist.
	   The next, Sanchez-Vicario was back to normal, Huber had let four
game points slip away, and the score was 1-1 in the final set.
	   Top seed Sanchez-Vicario, saving five break points along the
way, went on to a 6-1, 3-6, 6-3 victory in two hours and a place in
the Toyota final for the fifth consecutive year. She has not won
the title, however, since 1994.
	   Her opponent in Sunday's final will be Monica Seles, a four-time
winner here who has a 16-3 record against Sanchez-Vicario,
including the 1996 and 1997 Toyota finals.
	   Seles, seeded second, beat Thailand's Tamarine Tanasugarn 6-1,
6-4 under the closed roof of Ariake Colosseum as rain, instead of
the previous day's high wind, hit the tournament for the fourth
day.
	   Sanchez-Vicario and Huber, the No. 7 seed, agreed that the final
set's second game was the key, after Sanchez-Vicario had played
flawless, aggressive tennis in the first set and Huber had charged
back with some heavy hitting in the second.
	   At that point, French Open champion Sanchez-Vicario took a
medical timeout to have her right wrist taped. The WTA No. 4
started the third set by quickly losing her serve and falling
behind 40-0 in the next game.
	   But at 40-15, Huber missed a forehand into a wide open court and
Sanchez-Vicario reached deuce on a spectacular running backhand
down the line off what looked like a winning short, sharp
crosscourt.
	   Huber missed another chance with a backhand wide, and
Sanchez-Vicario finally evened the score 1-1 on her fifth break
point.
	   ``I don't know what happened,'' Huber said. ``Everything looked
like I was going to win that game for 2-0. I wasn't aggressive
enough, and she started to play better.
	   ``It's always hard against her. ... For a couple of games (after
the timeout) she just pushed the ball back, and suddenly she was
playing normally again. It was kind of weird,'' Huber added.
	   Sanchez-Vicario said of her hitting arm: ``It was not an injury.
It just got tight.''
	   She said the balls had felt heavy all week, and she started
feeling the problem in the second set.
	   The trainer's massage on her arm and taping of the wrist
``helped me to serve better and loosen up and hit my shots
better,'' she said.
	   ``On the important points I went for my shots again like I did
in the first set,'' said the Spaniard, who is ranked No. 4 by the
WTA to Huber's No. 21.
	   She said she has been practicing harder and staying on the court
longer in recent months, and ``I'm playing better now than when I
was No. 1'' in 1995.
	   After Sanchez-Vicario broke for 4-2 in the final set, Huber
threatened to break back. But from 0-40, the German netted three
shots, watched an ace zip past her and then netted another shot.
	   She was cited for a code violation as the threw her racket
across to the court to her sideline seat.
	   Sanchez-Vicario had to save two more break points in the final
game before clinching her 11th victory in 13 meetings between the
two.
	   Seles, the WTA No. 6, needed just 65 minutes to beat the
47th-ranked Tamarine here for the second consecutive year.
	   But in the final against Sanchez-Vicario, she said, ``I'll have
to play some unbelievable tennis.''

 &UR; Jospin ends visit with caution for Asian governments
 &UR; EDS: RECASTS lede and UPDATES throughout with Jospin's arrival in
Hong Kong, speech; ADDS byline and photo numbers
 &UR; With AP Photos HK101-102

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said
Saturday that reviving economic growth in Asia depends on regional
cooperation and financial reform.
	   Ending a three-day visit to China in its newest territory,
Jospin called on Asian governments to strengthen multilateral
dialogue and ``avoid the temptation of turning inward.''
	   ``The deteriorating international economic and financial
situation stands as a challenge'' to create growth and jobs without
sparking inflation, Jospin told a gathering of Hong Kong business
leaders and academics.
	   The prime minister flew to the territory Saturday from Shanghai,
where he said France's efforts to forge a ``constructive dialogue''
with China have led to improved human rights in the mainland.
	   Jospin pointed to the recent unprecedented visit by Mary
Robinson, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, and China's
reforms of its court system and gradual steps toward adopting
international judicial standards.
	   Those signs of progress aside, Chinese police continued a
clampdown on democracy campaigners during Jospin's visit. At least
four dissidents have been taken into custody since Wednesday, the
eve of his arrival, although two have been released.
	   In Hong Kong, Jospin praised Beijing for not devaluing China's
currency and Hong Kong for not scrapping the 15-year peg linking
its currency to the U.S. dollar.
	   He also said increased regulation of financial institutions was
needed if the region is to overcome the current economic recession.
	   Jospin's caution comes at a time when governments in the region
threaten to curb the free flow of investments and capital.
	   Malaysia enforced sweeping currency controls this month to help
loosen monetary policy and reflate the sagging economy, while Hong
Kong spent an estimated 15 billion U.S. on a stock-buying spree in
an effort to hold market speculators at bay.
	   In a backhanded criticism of such moves, Jospin urged a
``respect for the rules of the international economic and financial
game,'' while suggesting a more prominent role for the
International Monetary Fund.
	   ``We must bolster the political legitimacy of the IMF and review
its practical forms of organization and operation,'' Jospin added.
	   On Friday, Jospin met Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Hefei,
capital of the eastern province of Anhui, where the Chinese leader
was inspecting flood-recovery efforts.
	   Chinese-French relations have improved steadily since a rift two
years ago, when Paris irritated Beijing by selling Mirage fighter
jets to rival Taiwan.
	   An emphasis on business ties has helped foster better relations.
During Jospin's visit to China, French businesses signed 14
agreements worth 2.8 billion yuan (dlrs 339 million or 1.9 billion
francs).

 &UR; Report: Anwar's children bear the brunt of investigation
 &UR; ADDS ages of children, grafs 3,4

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The children of jailed ex-Deputy
Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim are bearing the brunt of the police
action against him, a newspaper reported Saturday.
	   One of Anwar's daughters has refused to go to school after being
harassed by other students, the Sun newspaper said quoting Anwar's
wife, Azizah Ismail.
	   Since Anwar's arrest Sunday, his five daughters, aged 6 through
19, and his 13-year-old son, have lived under siege with dozens of
policemen patrolling outside to ensure that Azizah does not
organize any rallies for political reform.
	   ``One daughter was told by her teacher to ignore all questions
from her peers while another said she is being constantly bombarded
with questions from her friends,'' Azizah, 46, said about her
eight-year-old.
	   Anwar, 51, was arrested under a security provision, but faces
accusations ranging from homosexuality to treason. Sordid details
of Anwar's alleged sex acts have been disclosed by Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad and many local papers have published explicit
accounts.
	   Another daughter, Nurul Ilham, 11, was so sick after Anwar's
arrest that she had to be rushed to hospital for treatment.
	   ``She misses her father very much and has been sick since he was
arrested,'' Azizah said. ``She hardly eats at all.''
	   Neither Azizah nor any of the children have seen or heard from
Anwar since he was marched off by masked riot policemen from the
family's home in Damansara Heights.
	   Requests by Anwar's lawyers for information have been ignored by
the police.

	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Opposition parties may have received
enough votes in national elections to oust Slovakia's authoritarian
leader from power, based on independent exit polls released after
the two-day voting ended Saturday.
	   Results from the parliamentary balloting, which election
officials said went smoothly despite wide-spread concerns
beforehand, won't be released until late Sunday.
	   But nationwide exit polls conducted by two agencies, one
sponsored by pro-government television, the other by the
pro-opposition TV Markiza, both indicated a broad opposition
alliance appeared to have gotten enough support to be able to form
the next government.
	   The hardline ruling party of Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, who
is widely assailed abroad for anti-democratic practices, narrowly
topped the list of 17 parties in the exit poll sponsored by state
TV and was a close second in the other.
	   But even adding the support of his sole likely ally in
parliament, the Slovak National Party, he would fall well short of
a majority and be significantly behind the total of four opposition
parties who have pledged to unite forces.
	   The headquarters of the top opposition party, the Slovak
Democratic coalition, erupted into deafening cheers when TV Markiza
updated its exit poll results to show the Coalition outpolling all
other parties with 27 percent, to 25 percent for Meciar's HZDS.
	   ``This is a vote for new hope and for a new beginning for
Slovakia,'' said Mikulas Dzurinda, the coalition's leader.

National Center for Media Propagation, it was based on interviews
with 8,000 voters as they left polling stations Friday and
Saturday.
	   But the four opposition parties together got well over 50
percent, it showed. If accurate, that would give them a majority of
the 150 seats in Parliament, which chooses both Slovakia's prime
minister and president.
	   Eleven other parties failed to receive the five percent minimum
required for seats in the Parliament, according to the exit poll.
	   The other poll, conducted by the MZK agency on behalf of the
private, pro-opposition TV Markiza, gave the opposition roughly
60-percent support based on its own nationwide interviews.

Opposition in street protests, protesters mine national road.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIRANA, Albania (AP)- Former President Sali Berisha on Saturday
announced plans for new street protests to demand the government's
resignation, while protesters in the south mined a section of the
national highway.
	   Despite international calls for all political parties to begin
dialogue, Berisha told about 3,000 supporters gathered at a rally
in Tirana that street protests would continue until the government
was ousted.
	   Berisha called Prime Minister Fatos Nano a ``killer'' and blamed
him for the current political crises.
	   ``We must liberate Albania ... from the corrupt government ...
and the terrorist gangs,''said Berisha.
	   Protesters in the south blocked and mined a section of the
national highway near the Greek border on Saturday morning,
Interior Ministry spokesman Artan Bizhga said.
	   Bizhga said that five hours after the road was blocked, police
regained control and deactivated eight mines, but traffic remained
blocked as police continued to search for other mines.
	   The same section of the national road was blocked earlier this
month and eight policemen were wounded during an exchange of fire
with the villagers of Lazarat, a village near the town of
Gjirokastra, 145 kilometers (90 miles) south of Tirana, and an
opposition stronghold.
	   The recent unrest in Europe's poorest country exploded after the
a popular opposition leader was killed outside Berisha's Democratic
Party headquarters on September 12.
	   Berisha blamed Nano for the killing and demanded his
resignation.
	   A funeral ceremony last week turned into an anti-government
rally, with thousands of Berisha supporters storming government
offices, the parliament and state television building.
	   International organizations are trying to mediate the beginning
of talks between the Democrats and the Socialists, but both sides
refuse, keeping tensions high in the country.

Tudjman condemns inter-party rows; demands investigation
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Tudjman admitting rift in his party in grafs 8-9 &QL; 
 &UR; By SNJEZANA VUKIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ President Franjo Tudjman on Saturday
demanded an urgent investigation into allegations that military
counter-intelligence is involved in a media campaign against
liberal politicians.
	   Tudjman announced unspecified consequences against those
involved. He was reacting to the controversy created by comments
from his Cabinet chief, who on Thursday accused another close
Tudjman aide of coordinating media attacks against moderates within
Tudjman's governing Croatian Democratic Union.
	   The accusations, by Hrvoje Sarinic against Ivic Pasalic, were
similar to ones raised earlier last week by another moderate
Tudjman supporter, Franjo Greguric.
	   Pasalic, a hardliner, denied the accusations.
	   The public battle reflected the growing rift between hardliners,
usually characterized as nationalists who oppose democracy, and
moderates, who lean toward organizing Croatia along Western lines.
	   The conflict has grown as the party loses popularity ahead of
next year's parliamentary elections. It is also seen as a way for
the two sides to position themselves for eventual party control
after Tudjman, who is rumored to be seriously ill, is gone.
	   The current affair might prompt Tudjman to finally side with one
of the fractions.
	   Later Saturday, Tudjman for the first time acknowledged ``a
rift'' in his party but vowed to solve the problem. He added that
in the process, ``one, two or three'' party members might be
removed, state-run news agency HINA reported.
	   Tudjman's earlier statement said it was ``utterly inadmissible
and irresponsible'' of senior state and party members ``to get
engaged into public discussion over the sensitive issues of
national security.''
	   When the investigation over the allegations is over, ``adequate
decisions'' will be made, the statement said, without elaborating.
	   Sarinic, in the second part of his interview published on
Saturday in the daily Jutarnji list, insisted Tudjman should deal
with the hardliners and intelligence service methods that he said
reminded him to the notorious secret service in the former
Communist Yugoslavia.
	   Croatia was a part of Yugoslavia until 1991. The Yugoslav secret
service was commonly considered ready to use all means to destroy
opponents of the ruling Communists.

IMF approves dlrs 840 million loan to Bulgaria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ The International Monetary Fund approved
a dlrs 840 million loan to Bulgaria aimed at supporting market
reforms and economic growth in the next three years, government
officials said Saturday.
	   The loan, approved Friday, will help Bulgaria service its dlrs 9
billion foreign debt while simultaneously closing or selling
inefficient state companies and, revamping its social benefit
system.
	   Finance Minister Muravei Radev said the government expected the
loan to be matched with loans from the World Bank, the European
Union and the G-24 group of developed countries.
	   Those loans would bring up the total loan amount to be received
by Bulgaria in the next three years to 1.6 billion dollars.
	   Radev said he expected that Bulgaria will reach its targeted 4
percent growth of the gross domestic product this year. He added
inflation would be no more that 6 percent compared to 16.4 percent
envisaged in the government budget. The IMF projects Bulgaria's
annual inflation this year to be 9 percent.

Marinos surge ahead in professional Japan League
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The 1995 champion Yokohama Marinos beat lowly
Avispa Fukuoka 3-0 Saturday and surged ahead of Urawa Reds to the
top of the second-stage table of the 18-team Japanese professional
soccer league.
	   Shunsuke Nakamura converted a 20-meter free kick for a 1-0
Marinos' lead at halftime. Shoji Jo and Bolivian midfielder Julio
Baldivieso added second-half goals against the visitors.
	   The Yokohama club now is one point ahead of second-place Nagoya
Grampus Eight, who beat visiting Cerezo Osaka 5-3 on penalties
after the two teams finished the 120 minutes of regulation and
extra time tied at 1-1.
	   First-stage winner Jubilo Iwata rose to third place, two points
behind the Marinos, with a 6-2 victory over JEF United Ichihara on
hat tricks by Daisuke Oku and Under-19 Japan international striker
Naohiro Takahara.
	   At Urawa, Tatsuhiko Kubo and Englishman Donaldo Goodman scored
in the first half for the visiting Sanfrecce Hiroshima's 2-1
victory over Urawa Reds who tumbled from the top to fourth place
with the second straight setback.

	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Opposition parties may have received
enough votes in national elections to oust Slovakia's authoritarian
leader, according to exit polls released after the two-day voting
ended Saturday.
	   Results from the parliamentary balloting, which election
officials said went smoothly despite widespread concerns, won't be
released until late Sunday.
	   But nationwide exit polls conducted by two agencies, one
sponsored by pro-government television, the other by the
pro-opposition TV Markiza, both indicated that a broad opposition
alliance appeared to have gotten enough support to form the next
government.
	   The hard-line ruling party of Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar,
who is widely assailed abroad for anti-democratic practices,
narrowly topped the list of 17 parties in the exit poll sponsored
by state TV and was a close second in the other.
	   But even adding the support of his sole likely ally in
parliament, the Slovak National Party, he would fall well short of
a majority and be significantly behind the total of four opposition
parties who have pledged to unite.
	   The headquarters of the top opposition party, the Slovak
Democratic Coalition, erupted into deafening cheers when TV Markiza
updated its exit poll results to show the coalition outpolling all
other parties with 27 percent, to 25 percent for Meciar's HZDS.
	   ``This is a vote for new hope and for a new beginning for
Slovakia,'' said Mikulas Dzurinda, the coalition's leader.
	   The state TV-sponsored exit poll showed HZDS with 28 percent, to
24 percent for the Slovak Democratic Coalition. Conducted by the
National Center for Media Propagation, it was based on interviews
with 8,000 voters as they left polling stations Friday and
Saturday.
	   But the four opposition parties together got well over 50
percent, it showed. If accurate, that would give them a majority of
the 150 seats in Parliament, which chooses both Slovakia's prime
minister and president.
	   Eleven other parties failed to receive the 5 percent minimum
required for seats in the Parliament, according to the state TV
poll.
	   The other poll, conducted by the MZK agency on behalf of the
private, pro-opposition TV Markiza, gave the opposition roughly 60
percent support based on its own nationwide interviews.
	    &UR; Exit polls ... PICKUP 10th graf pvs.

U.S. and eight European countries form a Balkan peace force
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
signed an agreement Saturday establishing a regional peace force
with counterparts from eight southeast European countries.
	   Signing the agreement with Cohen were defense ministers of three
other NATO countries, Italy, Turkey and Greece, and five
prospective alliance members in the Balkans: Macedonia, Slovenia,
Bulgaria, Rumania and Albania.
	   The force is not envisaged for any military intervention, but to
have a ``humanitarian'' role _ truce keeping and aid relief _
similar to the concept of U.N. multinational peace forces.
	   Cohen called the signing ``historic,'' adding, ``This new,
multinational peace force holds out hope that we can build a new
era.''
	   The establishment of the force has been partly prompted by
concerns over the fighting in Serbia's Kosovo province. The host of
the meeting, Macedonia, borders Yugoslavia _ the federation
dominated by Serbia _ and fears a spillover of violence into its
territory.
	   Hundreds of people have died and more than quarter of a million
have been displaced in the fighting between Serbian government
forces and independence-seeking ethnic Albanians who are a majority
in Kosovo.
	   In his opening speech at the meeting in Skopje, Macedonian
Defense Minister Lazar Kitanoski said the establishment of the
peace force is ``an important contribution to the relaxing of the
in the region.''
	   Cohen and the other participants also discussed NATO planning
for an possible strike in Kosovo against Yugoslav army troops and
Serbian police unless they stop their advance.
	   ``In Kosovo, the fires of hate rule the relentless march of
ethnic violence,'' Cohen said. ``The time has come to face this
crisis directly.''

Starr material: A reflection on U.S. culture, attitudes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo WX103 &QL; 
 &UR; By NANCY BENAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Whatever its role in presidential history, the
latest 7-pound (3-kilo) stack of documents from prosecutor Kenneth
Starr serves as a window on America's pop culture, its conflicted
attitudes toward sex and the dizzying pace of the Information Age.
	   The ``Titanic'' movie craze, the herbal fad ginko, the
death-of-Princess-Diana catharsis, even the banned diet drug
phen-fen make an appearance in the 3,183 pages of Monica Lewinsky
minutiae made public by Congress last week.
	   Where else would the dress have come from than the Gap, fashion
source for the khaki-clad masses?
	   Beeper messages ricochet among lawyers, lovers and
intermediaries, a sign of the technology-driven times. Faxes,
e-mail and Internet gossip chronicle the unraveling story.
	   The two volumes of documents are a kind of time capsule,
containing drafts of unsent letters, recollections of private
conversations, lists of comings and goings, logs of phone messages
and the like.
	   ``It will be a great document for a cultural historian,'' says
Warren Belasco, chair of American Studies at the University of
Maryland, Baltimore County.
	   While Belasco cautions that the oddities of the Clinton-Lewinsky
affair make it anything but typical, echoes of American life are
clear in the Starr documents.
	   Blended into legal treatises and document appendices are the
torments of young love and the pathos of middle-aged angst. Ms.
Lewinsky muses to Clinton about pop singer Sarah McLachlan's
lyrics, ``I don't know how to let you go.'' The baby boomer
president tells her that his life ``was falling apart'' when he hit
40, and that he kept a calendar tracking how long he had ``been
good'' about avoiding other women, she says.
	   How Americans react to the Lewinsky story _ with everything from
shock to a shrug _ serves as a sort of Rorschach test for the
United States.
	   ``I feel sad that we aren't more shaken by the disruption of a
marriage,'' says Les Parrott, a Seattle Pacific University
psychology professor who studies relationships.
	   James Twitchell, a University of Florida professor who writes
about American culture, says the frequent references to name brands
in the documents _ the Gap dress, the Zegna tie, the Black Dog
T-shirt _ reflect ``the commercial culture that runs across all of
our lives.''
	   Ms. Lewinsky emerges as a ``modern material girl,'' he says. She
is a walking exhibit of the trends of the times.
	   In a love note to Clinton, she tells how the lovers in
``Titanic'' remind her of them; her gifts to the president include
ginko, a popular herbal supplement; she marks her encounters with
the president in a Filofax day planner. Caller ID lets Ms. Lewinsky
know when the president is calling; her e-mail to a friend speaks
of sadness for the children of Princess Diana; her therapist
prescribes the drug phen-fen to help her lose weight.
	   One subtext that emerges from the Starr material is the speed
with which the principals in the unfolding drama gather and send
information, putting technology to full use with pagers, cell
phones, computers and the like.
	   ``They say that time travels much more quickly in the late 20th
century, and maybe this case is a good illustration of that,'' said
David Sorkin of the Center for Information Technology and Privacy
Law at the John Marshall Law School in Chicago.
	   The frantic atmosphere in the days before the Lewinsky matter
became public rings clear in the seven pager messages that Oval
Office secretary Betty Currie sends to Ms. Lewinsky in less than
two hours one morning.
	   Using her code-name ``Kay,'' Mrs. Currie tries a number of
approaches to persuade Ms. Lewinsky to telephone. ``Please call Kay
at home. It's a social call,'' says one. ``Please call re: family
emergency,'' says another, just seven minutes later. ``Please call,
have good news,'' says a third, after another seven minutes.
	   Professor Henry Graff of Columbia University, a scholar of the
presidency, says even historians shouldn't have access to such
intrusive information. But he also admits, ``You'd like to have had
this stuff for Abraham Lincoln.''

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) - Former tennis star Martina
Navratilova, who returned to her native Czech Republic for an
exhibition match, said Saturday her life after retiring from
professional tennis was a ``holiday.''
	   ``The less I do, the better,'' the relaxed Navratilova said in a
live interview with the public Czech TV Saturday. ``My life is a
holiday.''
	   Navratilova her activities include snowboarding, golf,
basketball, diving, and also walking her dog.
	   Commenting on current tennis, Navratilova said she likes to
watch the likes of Martina Hingis and others who are ``fierce
enough.''
	   ``These days, players have to be better athletes,'' she said.
``But I still think with nostalgia about the old times, when people
like John McEnroe played.''
	   Navratilova, who hails from a village outside Prague, defected
from Czechoslovakia in 1975 and obtained American citizenship.

Pakistani nuclear scientist asks businessmen to pay taxes to revive

economy

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) - The founder of Pakistan's nuclear
program, Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan, urged businessmen Saturday to pay
taxes to revive the country's ailing economy jolted by sanctions
following its atomic tests May, the state-run Associated Press of
Pakistan reported.
	   Cash-strapped Pakistan, burdened by a dlrs 32 billion external
debt and scant foreign exchange reserves, is scrambling to raise
funds from international donor agencies to bridge its balance of
payment gap.
	   The country's already fragile economy has been shaken further by
the international sanctions and the government said it could seek a
moratorium on the payment of external debt if promised loans are
not released.
	   Khan, addressing industrialists and businessmen in the southern
port city of Karachi, urged them to pay their taxes and donate
money to pull the country out of its economic crisis, the state
news agency reported.
	   Khan said the private sector played a big role in developing the
country's nuclear program.
	   It was the private sector, he said, that imported equipment used
in both the nuclear and missile programs. The government still owes
some businessmen millions of dollars for equipment, he said.
	   Pakistan conducted a series of nuclear test in May in response
to similar tests by its neighbor India.
	   Khan said Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif provided dlrs 25 million
to his laboratory for the completion of long-range Ghauri missile
program, despite the refusal of the finance ministry to release the
money.
	   ``We can hit a Ghauri missile at Bombay or New Delhi within five
minutes,'' he said adding that the missile also can carry a nuclear
war head.
	   ``It is so perfect that it can reach at any corner of India (in)
not more than 12 minutes.''
	   The Ghauri missile has been named after Muslim conqueror
Shahabuddin Ghauri, who captured Delhi by defeating Hindu warrior
``Prithvi'' _ the name of the Indian missile.
	   Animosity and bitterness runs deep between these two nations
which were carved out of British India in 1947 and have fought
three wars since then.

	   Note: The center monitors monologues on the ``Late Show with
David Letterman,'' CBS; ``The Tonight Show with Jay Leno,'' NBC;
``Politically Incorrect with Bill Maher,'' ABC; and ``Late Night
with Conan O'Brien,'' NBC. Although the number of late-night shows
waxes and wanes, the bulk of jokes since 1990 has come from ``The
Tonight Show'' and Letterman's programs on NBC and now CBS.

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Talk show host David Letterman said traffic
was so bad ``I had to squeeze through spaces that were narrower
than President Clinton's definition of sex.'' Fellow comic Bill
Maher dreamed up a cream rinse that the president could use ``after
a day of splitting hairs.''
	   The Clinton-Lewinsky melodrama is playing out against a riot of
ribald humor. Television comics and no-name Internet snipes alike
are intravenously hooked to it.
	   Never mind getting booted. Might Bill Clinton get hooted from
office?
	   The Center for Media and Public Affairs, which tracks the
content of late-night TV comedy with numbing precision, has never
seen such a torrent. But Clinton seems inoculated, says Robert
Lichter, president of the research institution.
	   ``What's remarkable is that Clinton is a laughingstock and it
doesn't seem to matter,'' he said.
	   William Weld, former Massachusetts governor and Clinton's choice
for Mexico ambassador last year, wondered whether snickers could
reach critical mass. ``If everybody's laughing when the president
of the United States walks into the room, it's time to go,'' he
said on the PBS TV network.
	   Laughing at the president may also help the nation heal _ a tole
for wit cited by the dead white guys of Western philosophy, one of
whom considered laughs ``the natural signs of an increase in
freedom.''
	   A common defense, submitting to barbs and turning them to one's
advantage, appears unavailable to the president.
	   Portrayed as wooden, Vice President Al Gore exaggerates his
woodenness and charms the crowd. But no one expects Clinton to ham
it up over women.
	   Others are busy doing that.
	   ``Macy's has a Clinton Day sale,'' goes one joke from
cyberspace. ``All pants half off.''
	   Asks another: Why does Clinton have a lady's undergarment
strapped to his arm? ``That's the patch _ I'm trying to quit.''
	   The tortured legal theory that Monica Lewinsky made sexual
contact with the president but he made no such contact with her has
provided more fodder: Jay Leno told his NBC ``Tonight Show''
audience that Clinton denied kissing the Blarney Stone while
visiting Ireland, ``claiming the stone kissed him.''
	   ``Comedians have gotten so much material they could do
all-Clinton monologues all the time,'' Lichter said. ``President
Clinton is the best thing to hit late-night comedians since Dan
Quayle.''
	   Actually, better.
	   Lichter's center has counted 1,138 Clinton jokes from late-night
monologues so far in 1998. That's on track to double the previous
record _ Republican candidate Bob Dole with 838 in 1996, the
election year. Former Vice President Quayle topped the jokefest in
1990 with only 162, back when shows were doing less political humor
overall.
	   (Q: What's the problem with political jokes? A: They get
elected.)
	   On any program where comedians riff off headlines, there's
little else. On his Web site, Leno breaks the Clinton scandal into
16 joke-stuffed categories: the Dress, Apologies, the Videotape and
more. He's got 18 cigar jokes alone.
	   On the World Wide Web, a frightening number of jokes lead to the
same punchline, ``Close but no cigar.''
	   What's going on here? Philosophers said humor can be used to
sting the subject or lance a boil in society, or both.
	   Comedy is found in ``the Ridiculous, which is a species of the
Ugly,'' Aristotle opined. ``The Ridiculous may be defined as a
mistake or a deformity.'' Essayist Arthur Koestler observed
``tension finds its outlet in laughter.''
	   And Sigmund Freud said wit is a ``release from inhibition.''
	   Freud also thought, ``Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.''

Ultranationalist Serb leader wants closer ties to Serbia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments by defeated candidate for Bosnian Serb
presidency. &QL; 
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The radical who won the
race for the Bosnian Serb presidency on Saturday said he would work
more closely with Serbia but also pledged to play by democratic
rules in office.
	   Nikola Poplasen is allied with the Bosnian Serb faction backing
war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic. His victory, announced Friday
by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, is
considered a blow against U.S.-backed attempts to encourage
moderation across Bosnia through financial aid to areas with
political leaders working to implement the Dayton peace agreement.
	   During the war and for the first years afterward, Bosnian Serb
radicals in charge pressed for union of the Serb part of Bosnia
with Serbia proper, something ruled out by the Dayton provisions,
which specifically mandate Bosnia as a nation made up of the Serb
substate and the Croat-Muslim federation.
	   Poplasen who ousted Western-backed incumbent Biljana Plavsic,
also criticized plans for a possible NATO strike in Serbia, in an
attempt to stop months of fighting between government forces and
Albanian guerrillas.
	   Serbia _ the main Yugoslav republic, which includes Kosovo
province _ would be justified in defending its territory in case of
such a scenario, he told reporters.
	   The West worries that a Poplasen government would work against
Dayton peace agreement provisions meant to restore a degree of
ethnic tolerance and introduce democracy to post-war Bosnia.
	   But on Saturday, Poplasen and his coalition partner, Dragan
Kalinic, pledged to preserve ``all the good that the international
community and the previous moderate Serb government accomplished''
and strive for a democratic society based on market economy.
	   The hardliners congratulated moderate Zivko Radisic on winning
the Serb seat of Bosnia's tripartite presidency. Poplasen said his
past relations with Radisic were ``correct and problem-free.''
	   Poplasen, who is due to appoint the premier-designate for the
Bosnian Serb substate, said he would listen to all suggestions and
was looking for a person ready to cooperate with other
parliamentary parties and the international community.
	   Plavsic congratulated her opponent on his victory.
	   Addressing the public through a live broadcast on an independent
television late Friday night, she said any reversal to the past was
impossible.
	   In Pale, the stronghold of Bosnian Serb ultranationalists,
Momcilo Krajisnik, the incumbent who lost out to Radisic, poked fun
at Western efforts to install moderates in leadership positions.
	   ``It was amusing to watch certain officials investing more
efforts that I lose than I invested to win,'' Krajisnik said.
	   Often blasted by foreign administrators in post-war Bosnia as
uncooperative and wishing to keep Bosnian Serbs as distant as
possible from others in the country, Krajisnik defended his record.
	   ``My aim was to protect the interest of Serb people,'' he said.
``I was never against Bosnia-Herzegovina, the country is a
reality.''

Hometown watches and wonders about John Glenn's space return
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN McCARTHY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW CONCORD, Ohio (AP) _ Dick Hale was in the coal mines the day
John Glenn orbited the Earth in 1962 and didn't think it was such a
big deal. What he really can't understand, though, is why his
town's home-grown hero wants to go up again.
	   ``I think he's foolish and I don't like spending a lot of money
for something that's not necessary,'' the retired miner said while
finishing off a fried bologna sandwich at a diner.
	   Gene Lambert, who also spent years in the coal fields, said he
admires Ohio's 77-year-old senator, but he thinks the mission next
month aboard Discovery was scheduled with an eye on the public.
	   ``He's great for publicity,'' Lambert said.
	   Glenn left New Concord five decades ago and rarely returns,
dividing his time between Washington and Ohio's capital, Columbus,
65 miles (105 kilometers) to the west. Even the Ohio Historical
Society marker at the town line gives him second billing to
Muskingum College, his alma mater.
	   But he's a favorite son all the same, and not everyone in New
Concord (pop. 2,000) is critical of his nine-day mission.
	   Mark Fields, a 20-year-old sophomore business major at
Muskingum, said he knew little about Glenn when he arrived from
Mount Sterling, Kentucky.
	   ``I knew he was an astronaut and I knew he was a senator from
Ohio, but that's about it,'' Fields said. ``But I learned he was a
good person and it (the shuttle flight) should be good for the
college.''
	   Fields and Sarah Akkerman, a sophomore from Columbus, said they
believe including Glenn on the Oct. 29 mission will allow NASA to
study how space flight affects older people. That's the official
reason the National Aeronautics and Space Administration chose him.
Glenn and the agency insist publicity isn't a factor.
	   About as close as you can get to the sky in Glenn's hometown is
the hilltop college. It was there that Yan Sun, an assistant art
professor, painted a formal portrait of Glenn.
	   Yan, 44, was an elementary school student in China when Glenn
soared into space for his three orbits, the first American to do
so. While the communist government frowned on all things American,
the Chinese people admired Glenn, Yan said.
	   ``We respect a hero, a real hero. My son is 10 years old. He's
following him and will try to go to space in the future,'' Yan
said.
	   Working only with photographs of Glenn, Yan completed the
portrait this year. It so impressed college officials, they bought
it for an undisclosed price to display on campus.
	   Glenn studied mathematics at Muskingum from 1939 to 1942, when
he left to enter an aviation cadet program during World War II. The
college awarded him a bachelor of science degree in 1962. His name
adorns the gymnasium that opened the same year he first went into
space.
	   ``We needed a name on it,'' college spokeswoman Janice Tucker
said with a laugh.
	   The college is in the midst of a two-month celebration of
Glenn's return to space. It has opened a display in the
administration building that features replicas of Discovery and of
Friendship 7, the capsule that propelled Glenn into space in 1962.
	   The college is publicizing the launch with a poster that shows
the shuttle appearing to lift off behind the gym. The campus
bookstore is stacked with Glenn T-shirts, sweatshirts, caps and
watches.

Yeltsin pledges money for police in restive Caucasus region
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin on Saturday ordered top
government officials to send money to police in the strife-torn
Caucasus republic of Dagestan, while the leader of breakaway
Chechnya condemned the small Wahhabi sect for allegedly trying to
undermine both Islam and regional authorities.
	   Yeltsin directed Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov and Finance
Minister Mikhail Zadornov to ``urgently find means to send
financial help'' to police in Dagestan, the president's press
office said in a terse, one-line announcement.
	   Dagestan, near the breakaway republic of Chechnya, has been torn
by tensions between ethnic and religious groups vying for power.
There have been several recent attacks on police stations, in which
police officers have been killed and weapons seized.
	   In August, Dagestan's Islamic leader was killed when his car was
blown up with a radio-controlled bomb, and a group of Wahhabi
extremists recently tried to create a separate Islamic state in
Dagestan.
	   A car-bomb ripped through a neighborhood in the capital
Makhachkala earlier this month, killing at least 17 people. Also
this month, Dagestani police arrested opposition leader Magomed
Khachilayev, who was wanted for storming a government building in
the spring. His brother, parliamentary deputy and Islamic leader
Nadir Khachilayev, escaped arrest and is in hiding.
	   Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov on Saturday accused Saudi
Arabia of trying to force ``its ideology, foreign to true Islam, on
the whole Muslim world'' by backing the fundamentalist Wahhabi
sect, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   Maskhadov told a meeting of spiritual and secular leaders in the
Chechen capital Grozny that Saudi Arabia was financing the Wahhabis
Chechnya, which he condemned for aiming at ``chaos and undermining
the foundations of government,'' Interfax said.
	   At least six people were killed in July clashes between Chechen
forces and members of the Wahhabi sect.
	   Most Chechens practice a moderate form of Islam.

Greek-Romanian hostage taker found dead in prison hospital

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ A hostage-taker captured in one of the
most disastrous police operations in recent Greek history was found
dead amid mysterious circumstances in a prison hospital Saturday,
security officials said.
	   Sorin Matei, 27, riveted Greeks to their television sets
Wednesday when he called the anchorman of a major private
television station to broadcast his demands live after bursting
into a central Athens apartment and holding a family hostage with a
hand grenade.
	   The four-hour standoff ended in disaster when the grenade
exploded after the apartment was stormed by police, who believed
the grenade was fake. Matei, one captive and 10 police officers,
including the police chief and his second-in-command, were injured.
	   The bungled raid led to the resignation of the chief, Thanassis
Vassilopoulos, and unleashed a storm of public recriminations
against the security forces and government. The death of Matei _
who collapsed just before speaking with a prosecutor _ will
significantly escalate the pressure on Premier Costas Simitis to
overhaul the national police force and could mushroom into one of
the most serious political crises to confront his government.
	   Officials immediately ordered an extensive probe into Matei's
death. Justice Minister Evangelos Yannopoulos ordered three
coroners to examine the body. An autopsy was planned for Sunday.
	   Meanwhile, government critics demanded detailed explanations
into the effort to recapture Greece's most-wanted fugitive.
	   ``The government must shed ample light on the curious result of
Wednesday's indescribable operation,'' said a statement from
Greece's main opposition party, New Democracy.
	   Authorities also must grapple with suggestions that Matei's
injuries did not appear life threatening. He was released from a
public hospital on Friday after doctors determined his wounds were
superficial, media reports said.
	   Matei, a strongly built man who was capable of scaling the
apartment building's central air shaft before taking the hostages,
was apparently under heavy sedation at the medical ward in the
maximum-security Korydallos prison, the reports said. This led to
media speculation that a heavy or improper dose could have caused
his death.
	   During the hostage drama, Matei said he believed he would be
killed if he was returned to prison. But he did not specify whom he
feared.
	   ``They will kill me and make it look like a suicide,'' said
Matei, who had escaped from custody six times and had already spent
nearly a decade in jail serving sentences for attempted murder and
armed robberies. He had more than 25 years left to serve.
	   Badly overcrowded conditions at Korydallos have frequently led
to mass jail breaks and violent prison riots during which several
inmates have died.
	   Matei, a Greek-Romanian, had embarrassed the Greek police
several times, escaping from police transfer facilities, prisons
and court buildings.
	   On Sept. 6, he used a hand grenade to take a police officer
hostage for almost eight hours before security forces released him.
He fled in a taxi and police were unable to track him down until
Wednesday, when they located him hiding inside an apartment
building near the capital's red light district.

Illegal immigrants occupy Paris church
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ About 100 illegal immigrants staged a sit-in
Saturday at a church in east Paris to protest a government decision
to deny them papers and to draw attention to the alleged shoddy
treatment of immigrants.
	   The protesters, all African, occupied the Notre-Dame d'Esperance
church in the Bastille neighborhood, and said they would remain
until the government agrees to a blanket acceptance of tens of
thousands of requests for papers by illegal immigrants.
	   They also were demanding the closure of administrative offices
where they said immigrants are held prior to being deported.
	   Immigrants and their supporters regularly stage marches, hunger
strikes, church sit-ins and other protests to press France's
leftist government to ``regularize'' all immigrants.
	   Earlier this year, immigrants occupied the Vatican mission in
Paris for several days.
	   But after legalizing 76,000 immigrants, the government recently
said it had rejected residency requests by more than 64,000 others,
and officials say they want to wrap up the immigration question by
the end of the year.
	   Rev. Jean Lavergnat, the Notre-Dame d'Esperance parish priest,
said Saturday he was opposed to the sit-in.
	   He urged the immigrants ``to reflect on what I told them when
they arrived _ that churches are for prayer.''
	   Some leftists have criticized Prime Minister Lionel Jospin as
being too tough on immigration, while the far-right National Front
has criticized him as being too soft. The Front blames immigrants
for high crime and unemployment.

	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ A Guatemalan court convicted three Swiss
citizens, one German and one Guatemalan man of drug trafficking
charges Friday and sentenced them to prison terms ranging from 12
to 20 years.
	   The verdict and sentences mark the final chapter of the
so-called ``German connection'' case involving dlrs 100 million in
shipments of cocaine sent from Guatemala to Europe hidden in
containers and ornamental plants.
	   The court in Puerto Barrios, 160 miles (260 kms) northeast of
Guatemala City, sentenced Swiss citizen and former Nestle executive
Andreas Heanggi Wyndler, 60, to 12 years in prison and a fine of
dlrs 77,000.
	   Nicholas Heanggi Chalandrian, 22, Andreas Heanggi's son, was
sentenced to 20 years and a dlrs 155,000 fine, as was Swiss citizen
Silvio Giovanoli, 30.

Thousands of rollerbladers take to Paris streets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Staking an ever greater claim to the streets of
Paris, about 5,000 rollerbladers raced through the capital on
Saturday, braving rain to mark ``Roller-City 98'' day.
	   Men and women, young and old, whizzed through the slippery, gray
streets, some dressed up as Mickey Mouse, others with their faces
painted.
	   Rollerblading has become hugely popular throughout France in
recent years, with an estimated two million people using blades to
commute to work, or just for fun.
	   On Saturday, the pack began their circuit at Montparnasse rail
station south of the River Seine and ended in Bercy, in eastern
Paris. Traffic was diverted from the route.
	   Some bus services also fell victim to the event. Leaflets stuck
on several bus stops apologized that there would be intermittent
service in the afternoon.
	   Every week, up to about 3,000 bladers meet Friday nights in
Place d'Italie on Paris' Left Bank to start a 30-kilometer circuit
through the capital, each time following a different route.
	   To boost security, they are accompanied by a special squad of
police officers also on blades. And to ensure the police are up to
scratch, they've been trained by professional skaters.

Playwright Arthur Miller helps open new American Academy in Berlin
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Six years in the planning, the new American
Academy in Berlin welcomed its inaugural fellows, including
playwright Arthur Miller, on Saturday at a lakeside villa formerly
used by the U.S. military.
	   ``We're replacing soldiers with scholars, artists and
professionals,'' academy president Everette Dennis said after
introducing the inaugural class of Berlin Prize Fellows.
	   Along with Miller, whose works include ``Death of a Salesman''
and ``The Crucible,'' the group of eight includes historians,
professors, an architectural critic, a novelist and poet C.K.
Williams.
	   Their projects range from researching the history of German
firms during the Nazi era to a book on the late Heiner Mueller, one
of postwar Germany's most popular and controversial playwrights.
	   Miller will discuss his work during a weeklong film
retrospective and hold a seminar for drama students.
	   ``It'll be interesting to talk to the young people,'' he said.
``I'll learn what they know.''
	   The privately funded academy is housed in a turn-of-the-century,
40-room villa on the Wannsee that was used by the U.S. Army's
Berlin Brigade as a recreation center until the last troops pulled
out in 1994.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Population experts now believe that several
African countries may achieve zero population growth in just a few
years. But family planners are not cheering.
	   The reasons are gruesome and worrisome: populations devastated
by AIDS and further threatened with food shortages, water
depletion, ecological collapse and social chaos.
	   Family planners have been trying for decades to halt the
population explosion in countries projected to double or triple
populations by 2050. But they didn't want it to happen this way.
They don't want allies that kill and destroy societies.
	   ``A lot of countries will not see expected population increases
because of rising death rates,'' said Lester Brown, president of
World Watch and author of a new report on world population
problems.
	   Revised United Nations projections for population growth will be
out at the end of October, and U.N. demographers confirm that the
impact of AIDS in some African countries will be dramatic, even
``unbelievable.''
	   AIDS, which killed 2.3 million adults and children last year,
will not slow worldwide population growth, however. That will reach
6 billion by the middle of next year and is expected to rise to
between 7.7 billion and 11 billion by 2050.
	   Hardest hit by AIDS is Zimbabwe, where 25 percent of the
population now carries the AIDS virus. Brown estimated its
population will stop growing and possibly begin declining in just
four years.
	   Current U.N. projections, made in 1996, have Zimbabwe more than
doubling in population, from 11 million to 24.9 million, by 2050.
	   Larry Heligman, assistant director of the U.N. population
division that draws up the long-range projections, said
demographers are closely watching deaths from AIDS in 34 countries.
These include countries where the infection rates have hit 2
percent or where the affected population is large, such as India
which has more than 4 million of the world's estimated 30 million
people now infected by the virus.
	   ``When you begin to look at the projections beyond 2005, what we
are seeing is just unbelievable,'' Heligman said in an interview.
He said some revisions were made in projections two years ago
because of AIDS, but the 1998 impact will show ``even stronger
devastation.''
	   Ironically, alarm over the impact of AIDS on population in the
worst-hit countries comes as the spread of the virus has leveled
off or declined in the United States and other wealthier countries
and is slowing even in some poorer countries: Thailand, Brazil and
Uganda, for example.
	   Fueling the concern are the first detailed global figures on
AIDS infection percentages released at an international AIDS
conference in June. In addition to the impact on Zimbabwe, the U.N.
data show Botswana with 25 percent AIDS infection, Namibia with 20
percent, Zambia with 19 percent, Swaziland with 18.5 percent and
several other African countries with 10 percent or more.
	   By contrast, the AIDS infection rate in the United States is
0.57 percent. The global rate also remains below 1 percent.
	   Groups working to control rapid population growth around the
world are concerned the new projections will be viewed as support
for the cynical view that the world's problems will take care of
themselves no matter what humans do.
	   ``We must not let people think that an epidemic is going to
solve problems. It's going to worsen them,'' said Amy Coen,
president of Population Action International, which conducts
research and supports efforts to slow population growth worldwide.
	   Coen, in an interview, noted that AIDS usually hits people in
the prime of life, in their most productive years. In some
countries, the number of AIDS orphans _ children who have lost both
parents to AIDS _ is in the hundreds of thousands.
	   In Uganda, where the impact of AIDS is acute despite recent
gains, there are 1.7 million AIDS orphans.
	   ``No country can afford a generation of throwaways,'' Coen said.
``The next generation isn't just going to pop up fine.''
	   Brown, in his Worldwatch report, cites a number of pressures in
addition to AIDS that may pull down populations down by pushing up
death rates, including the environmental effects of population
growth: deforestation, soil erosion and falling water tables.
	   The challenge, said Brown, is to keep families small before
disease, environmental deterioration or resulting social chaos
force tragic population declines.
	   ``We had hoped we'd be able to stabilize populations by bringing
down birth rates,'' Brown said. ``Now, some of our worst fears are
being realized.''

Guatemalan court sentences Swiss, German defendants in drug case
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with Swiss foreign ministry saying
sentences too harsh, Nestle comment. No pickup. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ A Guatemalan court convicted three Swiss
citizens, one German and one Guatemalan man of drug trafficking and
sentenced them to prison terms ranging from 12 to 20 years.
	   The verdict and sentences Friday mark the final chapter of the
so-called ``German connection'' case involving dlrs 100 million in
shipments of cocaine sent from Guatemala to Europe hidden in
containers and ornamental plants.
	   The Swiss foreign ministry called the sentences ``extremely hard
and disproportionate'' and Nestle, the company one of the Swiss men
worked for, said it would appeal.
	   The court in Puerto Barrios, 160 miles (260 kms) northeast of
Guatemala City, sentenced Swiss citizen and former Nestle executive
Andreas Heanggi Wyndler, 60, to 12 years in prison and a fine of
dlrs 77,000.
	   Nicholas Heanggi Chalandrian, 22, Andreas Heanggi's son, was
sentenced to 20 years and a dlrs 155,000 fine, as was Swiss citizen
Silvio Giovanoli, 30.
	   German hotel manager Joachin Frank Schilling, 52, who worked for
another suspect already serving a prison term in the case in
Germany, was sentenced to five years in prison or dlrs 27,375, plus
a fine of dlrs 15,000.
	   A former Guatemalan police commander, Jose Luis Zebadua Salazar,
35, was sentenced to 12 years and a dlrs 77,000 fine for protecting
the shipments. Another Guatemalan accused of driving a truck in
which one of the cocaine shipments was found was acquitted.
	   The defendants said they had been unwitting accomplices.
	   The four-week trial, based on oral arguments presented before a
judge instead of a jury, was held under tight security with about
100 anti-drug police guarding the court building.
	   The alleged scheme was uncovered in November 1996 when police in
Duesseldorf, Germany, found 170 kilograms (375 pounds) of cocaine
hidden in plastic bags in a shipment of Guatemalan hammocks.
	   A spokesman for the Swiss Federal Office of Foreign Affairs,
Livio Zanolari, said the ministry would seek further information
from Guatemalan authorities on the circumstances which led to the
disproportionate sentences.
	   The Nestle group, which has supported Haenggi since his arrest,
said it was shocked by the verdict.
	   ``We have closely followed the case and nothing that has been
said and brought before the court has changed our belief in the
integrity and innocence of Andreas Heanggi,'' spokesman Hansjoerg
Renk said.
	   Nestle will continue to provide support to Heanggi and his
family during the appeal, Renk said. He said the firm is concerned
for the health of Heanggi and will do what it can to ensure the
appeals process is as short as possible, Renk said.

Defending champion Sweden wins doubles and advances to final

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes, ADDS byline. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ After two tough opening singles, the
doubles match turned out to be easier than expected for the Swedish
Davis Cup champions.
	   Jonas Bjorkman and Nicklas Kulti won in three straight sets,
6-2, 6-2, 6-2, against Javier Sanchez and Julian Alonso on the fast
Taraflex court at the Royal Tennis Hall.
	   Saturday's lopsided victory gave Sweden _ which has never lost a
Davis Cup tie after taking a 2-0 first-day lead _ an unbeatable 3-0
advantage in the best-of-5 match semifinal.
	   ``We knew from the beginning that there would be tough matches,
but we were hoping for the doubles to be a little bit easier,''
Bjorkman said. ``The singles matches definitely were supposed to be
tough. They were tough. We managed to win them, but the doubles was
a little bit easier than we expected.''
	   ``The doubles against Germany (quarterfinals) was probably the
best one I think, because that was against a team that was on a
really top level. This one was good, but the level of the opponents
was a little bit weaker.''
	   Bjorkman, who won the Stockholm Open at the Royal Tennis Hall a
year ago for one of his finest victories on the ATP Tour, gave
Sweden a 1-0 lead Friday with a 6-3, 7-5, 6-7 (5-7), 6-3 victory
over Alex Corretja.
	   Davis Cup rookie Thomas Johansson had a dream debut in the
second match, beating fifth-ranked Carlos Moya 7-5, 7-6 (7-4), 7-6
(8-6).
	   Sunday's reverse singles are now likely to be shortened to
best-of-3 sets. Bjorkman is scheduled to start against Moya in a
match between the team's No. 1 selections.
	   Bjorkman and Kulti were never broken during the doubles match
that lasted only 1 hour, 17 minutes. Sanchez, the oldest player on
the Spanish team, dropped his serve four times in six service
games. Alonso was broken twice.
	   ``The Swedes moved like fish in the water,'' said Spanish
captain Manuel Santana. ``They played incredible today. I was very
impressed.''
	   Sanchez agreed.
	   ``I've faced them on the tour, but they've never played like
this,'' he said. ``I served OK, but they returned so well.''
	   Sweden will play the winner between the United States and Italy
in the Dec. 4-6 final. Italy led 2-0 after Friday's singles matches
in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
	   Sweden will play the final on the road no matter which country
wins the other semifinal. If Italy prevails, indoor clay is likely
to be the surface.
	   ``I'm not sure I'm going to be there, probably only for the
doubles,'' said Bjorkman, whose weakest surface is clay.
	   ``I'm definitely going to try anything I can to be able to play
singles. But it might be that the clay court guys have to step in
and play the final.''
	   Sweden has great depth. In three matches this year on indoor
clay, hardcourt and Taraflex, which is faster than hardcourt,
Swedish captain Carl-Axel Hageskog has used seven singles players.
	   Bjorkman was a member of the Swedish team that won the 1994
final 4-1 against Russia in Moscow, where he only played doubles.
In 1996, when France edged Sweden 3-2 in the greatest final ever at
Malmo, Sweden, Bjorkman also played doubles only. Last year, when
the Swedes shut out the United States 5-0 in Goteborg, Sweden,
Bjorkman played both singles and doubles.
	   Sweden has played 11 finals since its first victory at the Royal
Tennis Hall in 1975, when former great Bjorn Borg anchored the
team. With its six wins and five runners-up finishes, Sweden is the
most successful Davis Cup nation in the last two decades.
	   Spain reached two Davis Cup finals in the 1960s, but never won
the competition. With its victory, Sweden now leads Spain 9-3 in
Davis Cup ties.

As Germans vote, Kohl and rival both skirt risks of future

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ One talks about the past, the other about
the future. But despite their different points of reference,
Chancellor Helmut Kohl and his rival Gerhard Schroeder have similar
visions for where Germany is headed.
	   Both candidates in Sunday's national election are playing on the
nation's love of stability, which makes Germans feel comfortable at
a time of global economic turmoil. But it leaves open the question
of whether the winner will tackle reforms.
	   Whoever wins _ the conservative Christian Democrats or the
center-left Social Democrat _ must oversee two enormous changes for
Germany next year: the government's move back to Berlin, its prewar
capital, and the switch to a common European currency, the euro.
	   At the same time, the fight against unemployment topping 10
percent appears to require innovative leadership, and neither
candidate offers a specific plan.
	   In fact, both Kohl and Schroeder have the same general ideas,
such as cutting the thicket of regulations that hurts Germany's
competitiveness _ making it hard, for example, to start a company _
and promoting access to venture capital.
	   No one talks publicly about chopping away at the social welfare
net, which drives up labor costs and makes German products harder
to sell abroad. If anything, Schroeder's Social Democrats want to
hand out more government money for social programs _ and do away
with modest cuts passed by Kohl.
	   Torn between the reassuring, fatherly Kohl and the energetic
Schroeder, a state governor untested on the world stage, many
Germans were expected to make up their minds only on Election Day.
Two polls published Saturday put the share of undecided voters at
up to 21 percent.
	   With the race so tight, neither candidate is taking risks. They
have avoided introducing new ideas that might attract new
supporters but alienate their parties' traditional voters.
	   Kohl, after 16 years in office, presents himself as a living
symbol of Germany's rise after World War II to a benign, dependable
world power _ an image that resonates with many of the nation's
60.5 million voters.
	   Stability is his message, and he pushed it at every campaign
stop in rambling speeches that never strayed from the theme.
	   ``Our country must remain a rock in a stormy sea, reliable for
our partners all over the world,'' Kohl said Friday in his final
rally in Mainz before a crowd of 10,000 people.
	   Even more than Kohl, Schroeder has stuck to a script designed to
appeal to the widest possible audience with its lack of specific
proposals. One of his mottos: ``We're not going to do everything
differently, we'll just do many things better.''
	   Schroeder wound up his campaign Friday in Berlin saying the
nation faced a choice between ``moving ahead or staying put,'' a
point that resonates with younger Germans who have known no other
chancellor but Kohl.
	   The Social Democrat, who won his party's nomination thanks to
his easy, populist charm, has other reasons choosing his words
carefully: avoiding mistakes.
	   In the last election, in 1994, Schroeder's party lost partly
because of campaign gaffes such as confusing net and gross when
talking about the economy. Kohl's party had a field day.
	   Schroeder also is wary of offending his party's strong left
wing, whose support he would need to govern and which mistrusts his
nudging of the Social Democrats toward a market-friendly political
center.
	   Schroeder's proposed Cabinet ministers further cloud the
candidate's positions. An outspoken computer entrepreneur who would
be economics minister espouses free-market ideals, in direct
contrast with the designated finance minister, party chief Oskar
Lafontaine, who wants government to exert greater control over the
financial markets.
	   At the same time, Schroeder has made clear he doesn't feel bound
by the party platform with its strong defense of the welfare state
and other traditional ideals of the left.
	   Even though the candidates' promises vary little, many see a
vote for Schroeder as a vote for change.
	   ``He didn't impress me very much, but we need some fresh air,''
said student Marion Rutz, 19, after listening to Schroeder stump in
the last week in Kohl's home state, Rhineland-Palatinate, before
the election. ``We need a new man from which ever party who will
give us new energy.''

Olano all but secures Spanish tour on regaining No. 1 post
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FUENLABRADA, Spain (AP) _ Barring only a major upset, Spaniard
Abraham Olano was all but ensured victory in the Tour of Spain
cycling marathon when he regained the No. 1 post in the second-last
stage Saturday.
	   The Banesto cyclist, who has sported the yellow jersey for most
of the 22-day tour, is likely to be declared overall champion
Sunday following the last and traditionally ceremonial stage in and
around Madrid.
	   Two-year defending champion Alex Zulle won Saturday's stage, a
39-kilometer (24-mile) individual time trial, which he covered in
46:36.03.
	   Olana, who finished a mere second behind, regained the overall
leadership from Jose Maria Jimenez and now holds a strong 1:23
advantage over runnerup Fernando Escartin, also of Spain.
	   Jimenez, who led the tour for the sixth, seventh and eighth
stages, grabbed back the top spot on Friday from Olano but he
flagged in the time trial and now lies No. 3 overall, nonetheless
ensuring an all-Spanish lineup on the honors podium Sunday.
	   U.S. rider, Lance Armstrong, who this season returns to cycling
after a year-long absence due to testicular cancer, demonstrated
his awesome recovery powers by finishing eight seconds behind Zulle
to end third Saturday and edge into an admirable fourth place in
the overall standings ahead of world No. 1 Laurent Jalabert of
France.
	   The final stage will be held over 163 kilometers (101 miles)
starting and finishing in Madrid.

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Fiorentina took sole possession of first place in
the Italian League and Gabriel Batistuta moved into a tie for the
scoring lead as the Argentine striker registered a hat-trick in his
club's 3-1 rout of AC Milan in Saturday's third-round action.
	   Batistuta scored six minutes after kickoff and then added two
goals early in the second half to win his personal battle with
German forward Oliver Bierhoff, who scored on a late penalty kick
for Milan, and give Fiorentina a perfect 3-0-0 start to the season.
	   On an afternoon of outstanding individual performances,
Brazilian striker Marcio Amoroso tallied twice in the first seven
minutes to lead Udinese past Salernitana 2-0, while Marco
Delvecchio also had two goals by halftime in AS Roma's 2-0 win over
Venezia.
	   Batistuta and Amoroso both have five goals already.
	   Elsewhere Saturday, Bari and Bologna played a 0-0 draw.
	   Two-time defending champion Juventus of Turin faced AC Parma at
night.
	   At Milan, Batistuta capitalized when veteran defender Alessandro
Costacurta accidentally lost the ball deep in his own territory.
The Argentine gathered the ball and sent a precise, right-footed
shot home to make it 1-0. Batistuta scored off Portuguese
midfielder Rui Costa's assist in the 46th minute and then sent a
free kick just under the crossbar in the 52nd.
	   Bierhoff, who led the league with 27 goals while playing for
Udinese last season, fixed the final score with his fourth goal, in
the 69th. Milan dropped to 2-0-1.
 &UR; Udinese 2, Salernitana 0 &QC; 
	   At Udine, Amoroso slammed a pass from Belgian midfielder Johan
Walem into the roof of the net in the fourth minute and closed a
counterattack in the seventh for his second straight two-goal game.
Salernitana, playing in Serie A for the first time in 50 years, is
the only team in the league to have lost all its matches. Udinese
is 2-1-0.
 &UR; Roma 2, Venezia 0 &QC; 
	   At Rome, the hosts improved to 2-1-0 as Delvecchio _ making a
rare start in place of struggling forward Gustavo Bartelt of
Argentina _ scored 20 seconds into the game and again in the 14th
minute. Venezia is 0-1-2.
 &UR; Bari 0, Bologna 0 &QC; 
	   At Bari, South African striker Phil Masinga beat Bologna 'keeper
Francesco Antonioli with a header in the 39th minute, but a
defender salvaged the draw by blocking the ball at the line with
his body. Bari is 1-2-0, Bologna 0-1-2.
	   The games were pushed ahead of the rest of the schedule to
provide an extra day of preparation for clubs in UEFA Cup action
Tuesday.
	   Sunday's games see Internazionale of Milan at Empoli, Lazio of
Rome at Perugia, Cagliari hosting Sampdoria of Genoa, and Vicenza
at Piacenza.

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   The conservative Christian Democrats and center-left Social
Democrats are the two main parties in Germany's election Sunday.
Here are some of their campaign platforms.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl has put a strong stamp on the Christian
Democrats' program. By contrast, the Social Democratic candidate,
Gerhard Schroeder, has said he will feel free to toss elements of
the platform that don't work in government.
 &UR; ___
 &UR; UNEMPLOYMENT
	   CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS: Decrease number of jobless _ currently
about 4.2 million _ by 500,000 within a year. Lower starting pay
for unskilled labor. Government subsidies for people who take
low-paying jobs. Create community service jobs for long-term
unemployed.
	   SOCIAL DEMOCRATS: Shorten work hours to create jobs.
Job-creation cooperation among employers, unions, government, and
possibly Roman Catholic and Lutheran churches. Raise salaries to
increase consumption and therefore jobs. Subsidize companies
offering job training. Make low-paid jobs subject to social
security tax to discourage companies from hiring low-paid workers,
which party claims is creating underclass.
 &UR; TAXES
	   CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS: Cut income taxes by 30 billion marks.
Possible increase in value-added tax to compensate. Tighten
loopholes. Simplify tax code. Decrease tax burden from 25.9 percent
to 15 percent in lowest bracket, from 53 percent to 39 percent in
highest bracket.
	   SOCIAL DEMOCRATS: Decrease tax burden in lowest bracket to 22
percent, eventually to 15 percent. Decrease tax burden for highest
bracket to 49 percent.
 &UR; ECONOMY
	   CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS: Reduce red tape to promote investment and
create jobs. Better access to risk capital for start-up companies.
Promote technology.
	   SOCIAL DEMOCRATS: Double government funding for technology
research. Cut bureaucracy in everyday life, and red tape for
businesses. Review laws and regulations to see if they hamper
efficiency.
 &UR; CITIZENSHIP
	   CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS: Ease laws giving citizenship to foreign
residents, but with strict rule that foreigners becoming German
must give up old citizenship.
	   SOCIAL DEMOCRATS: Allow dual citizenship for foreign residents
who become German.
 &UR; CRIME
	   CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS: Toughen penalties for drug-related and
violent crimes. Lower juvenile crime age to try 18- to 21-year-olds
as adults. Hasten deportation of foreigners convicted of crimes.
	   SOCIAL DEMOCRATS: Swifter trials. More street cops. Mandatory
sentencing for minor crimes, such as robbery. Controlled
distribution of heroin to serious addicts.
 &UR; MILITARY:
	   CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS: Maintain mandatory conscription; military
strength at 340,000 soldiers; public swearing-in of soldiers.
Support reform and strengthening of NATO.
	   SOCIAL DEMOCRATS: Reduce draft according to demand. Reduce size
of forces. Send German soldiers as U.N. peacekeepers. Maintain
public swearing-in of soldiers. Support NATO.
 &UR; ENERGY
	   CHRISTIAN DEMOCRATS: Maintain nuclear plants. Increase safety of
nuclear waste transports. Double solar, wind and hydro power by
2010. Create energy tax but only with support from other European
Union nations.
	   SOCIAL DEMOCRATS: Close nuclear plants ``as quickly as
possible.'' Cease transport of nuclear waste, storing it instead at
nuclear plants.

<TEXT>
	   ALTOS DE CHAVON, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Three generations of
Lopez women huddled in the tiny bathroom while red tiles tore off
the roof above them and rained down on the parking lot in a
deafening crash.
	   Cruz Maria, 69, sat on the toilet. Her daughter Sandra, 39,
squeezed into the shower stall. Sandra's daughter Mariangel, 14,
sat on her grandmother's lap.
	   Hurricane Georges had reached the Dominican Republic in a
furious swirl that would kill more than 300 people. And the Lopez
family was scared.
	   When the winds began at 5:30 a.m. Tuesday, Sandra was already
awake, serving chamomile tea to an Associated Press photographer
stranded in Altos de Chavon, a wealthy seaside community of artists
on the Dominican Republic's eastern tip.
	   The television was tuned to the Weather Channel, where
forecasters described the hurricane's devastating pass through
Puerto Rico and speculated about the destruction it caused there.
	   By 8 a.m. the winds became strong. The family rushed to secure
the doors and close the wooden shutters of the windows.
	   Cruz Maria went to shut a balcony door and slipped, injuring her
hip. She lay on the tile floor for the next 90 minutes moaning as
the winds increased outside.
	   Her daughter finally fashioned a sling out of a bedsheet and
dragged Cruz Maria into the bedroom, where she rested on a bed
while the winds became a whistle and the shutters slammed
violently.
	   Sandra rubbed ointment on her mother's back, urging her to stay
still. Cruz Maria insisted on helping secure the apartment and got
up.
	   Bending palm trees at a 45-degree angle, the howling wind began
to tear off the roof tiles and smash them into parked cars with
thumps. The shooting rain pinned leaves to the walls of their
apartment building.
	   Suddenly, everything stopped. The sun came out, and a surreal
silence descended on the complex.
	   Voices began to speak out.
	   ``Is everyone OK?'' a neighbor yelled.
	   ``Dona Luchi? Are you all right?'' Sandra asked incredulously.
	   ``We're all OK, thank God,'' came the response.
	   One by one, people ventured out of their apartments. Their
voices echoed as they wandered through the parking lot staring at
the smashed windows of their battered cars.
	   Glass shards sparkled in the alley next to the apartment
building. A six-foot water heater had been ripped off the roof and
slammed to the ground. Broken roof tiles and shredded leaves
carpeted the pavement.
	   And as suddenly as Georges had disappeared, it was back. The sky
darkened again, and neighbors screamed to one another to get back
inside.
	   The eye had passed _ and the worst was yet to come.
	   In a moment, the air went from dead calm to explosive fury. A
shutter in a bedroom crashed open and the palm trees groaned as
they bent again to the relentless wind.
	   The windows in the living room wobbled back and forth and part
of the roof lifted off and shattered in 10 seconds of deafening
terror.
	   Sandra shrieked, and the women fled to the only room with no
windows _ the maid's bathroom.
	   Another part of the roof fell and Cruz Maria began to murmur the
Hail Mary. The others soon joined her.
	   ``Lord, we are lucky to be here, but have mercy,'' Sandra said.
	   Mariangel began to whimper. Her grandmother held her closer.
	   The only way of knowing what was happening outside was by the
sounds, and every crack or pop led to a guessing game about what
had broken or fallen.
	   After an hour, the winds slowly lessened. The banging of the
shutters became less fierce, and the shattering tiles less
frequent.
	   The women decided to venture out.
	   Through the driving rain, an unnatural darkness had settled on
Altos de Chavon, but the landscape was somehow clearer. The trees
had been stripped of their leaves and muddy, 20-foot (6-meter)
waves crashed onto the distant beach.
	   The black asphalt of the parking lot was red with pieces of roof
tiles. Entire roofs had disappeared from nearby houses. Uprooted
trees and lampposts blocked the streets.
	   An inch of water covered the floor of the apartment, and more
dripped down through the ceiling.
	   But Sandra insisted on setting the table for dinner. Mariangel
laid out the wicker place mats and china and lighted three candles.
She, her mother and grandmother sat down to leftover lasagna.
	   A knock at the door and Dona Luchi, the neighbor, stepped in,
dripping wet, with a pitcher of hot cocoa and marshmallows. She sat
down, and Sandra said grace.
	   ``Thank God we're safe with our loved ones,'' she said. ``All
our things may be ruined, but I'm happy to be here with my
family.''

Government, investors to start talks over bond repayment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. RECASTS, UPDATES with government to start negotiations
with investors on Tuesday. CHANGES byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By JUDITH INGRAM &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian government negotiators will start talks
with investors on Tuesday over new terms for the state to repay its
enormous debt, the government announced Saturday.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov chaired a closed-door meeting to
discuss the possible terms for Russia's repayment of billions of
dollars worth of treasury bonds held by Russian and foreign banks.
The cash-strapped government announced in mid-August that it would
have to set new terms and timing for repayment, in effect freezing
the bonds.
	   In addition to Primakov, Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov,
Central Bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko, First Deputy Prime
Minister Yuri Maslyukov, and Economy Minister Andrei Shapovalyants
attended the meeting.
	   Zadornov said a new government working group chaired by
Shapovalyants was being formed to negotiate with banks over the
debt repayment. He said that the government and Central Bank had
already formulated their proposal but that it would not be
announced until Tuesday, according to a press statement from the
government.
	   It was Zadornov's first day on the job since being reappointed
to the post of finance minister on Friday. His reappointment
prompted another top economic policy maker, Alexander Shokhin, to
quit abruptly on Friday after just 10 days on the job.
	   Shokhin, who had held the post of deputy prime minister, told a
news conference Saturday that it was a ``political mistake'' for
President Boris Yeltsin to call again on Zadornov, who had served
in the previous two administrations.
	   Zadornov is seen as the only member of the government team so
far assembled to be fully committed to Russia's pursuit of
market-oriented economic reforms. But in the eyes of Shokhin and
others, he is tainted by his association with the government's
decision last month to devalue the ruble and effectively default on
its loans.
	   ``By reappointing the man responsible for the collapse of the
financial system, Primakov has assumed responsibility for the
previous financial policy,'' Shokhin said.
	   Shokhin said that Primakov's government had up to four months to
prove it could handle the crisis, or run into political deadlock.
	   ``A period of three to four months is a deadline before which
the government has to do something. If it fails, the (economic and
political) crisis will deepen,'' Shokhin said.
	   If Primakov succeeds in leading Russia out of its worst economic
crisis since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the Cabinet may last
at least until the next parliamentary elections next fall, Shokhin
said.
	   Shokhin, appointed on Sept. 15, previously had served as
economics minister at the start of Russia's post-Soviet market
reforms. Under Primakov, he was Russia's liaison to Western
lenders, and he met with International Monetary Fund
representatives on Friday before tendering his resignation.
	   The IMF team left Moscow without recommending the next
installment of a dlrs 22.6 billion loan package at the end of the
month. The IMF has stressed that it wants to see evidence of the
government's enduring commitment to market-oriented economic
reforms before it agrees to release any more of the money it
promised Russia in July.

Paper: Foiled embassy bombing in Kampala was to be biggest

	   KAMPALA, Uganda (AP) _ The foiled bombings of the U.S. Embassy
and other sites in the Ugandan capital were to have been more
devastating than those at American diplomatic missions in
neighboring Kenya and Tanzania that killed 259 people, a newspaper
said Saturday.
	   ``Sudan wanted to retaliate for the U.S. missile strikes in
August with devastating bomb explosions in Kampala. The explosions
were to be carried out in the city last week,'' the
government-owned New Vision newspaper quoted unidentified sources
as saying.
	   ``This was going to be worse than Nairobi. Terrorists planned to
explode a one-ton bomb (at the embassy); more powerful than the one
used in Kenya,'' the newspaper quoted one source as saying.
	   Nearly simultaneous Aug. 7 blasts killed 248 people in Nairobi
and 11 in Dar es Salaam. In retaliation, on Aug. 20 the United
States carried out cruise missile strikes on alleged terrorist
camps in Afghanistan and on a factory in Khartoum, Sudan that
allegedly manufactured chemicals used in terrorist attacks.
	   Police are holding 20 people in Kampala, including two men
described by Ugandan security officials as masterminds of the
Nairobi and Dar es Salaam bombings, in connection with the plan to
blow up the U.S. mission in Kampala and other sites, which have not
been identified.
	   New Vision said among the 20 are eight Ugandans and 10 Somalis.
The newspaper said police have not identified the two leading
suspects, although they are said to be neither Ugandan nor Somali.
	   The newspaper said police have seized a dump truck that was
reportedly to have been used in the Ugandan bombing as well as
explosives.

Kosovo guerrillas trapped _ and scared

<TEXT>
	   VASILEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Four months ago, Niki was pouring
drinks in a bar in Germany and sending his savings to cushion his
parents' hardships in Yugoslavia's turbulent Kosovo province.
	   Now, he is surrounded by tanks, artillery and thousands of Serb
police and Yugoslav soldiers. Niki and other ethnic Albanian
separatist guerrillas are defending their last stand in the
mountainous Drenica region against an overwhelming force that vows
to crush them.
	   ``There are too many soldiers and too many police,'' says Niki,
24, who won't give his last name. He peers from the hilltop bushes
toward columns of dense smoke from Vasilevo and two other villages
that just fell to Serb tanks. ``We can't fight them.''
	   Drenica was the first region in Kosovo, a province of the
Yugoslav republic of Serbia, seized by the Kosovo Liberation Army
when fighting began in February. Its loss would crush the KLA's
morale. Since then, more than 700 people have died, almost 300,000
have fled their homes and a Serb scorched-earth campaign has laid
waste to much of western Kosovo.
	   Niki and fellow fighters ham it up for a few minutes for
visiting journalists, scowling and waving assault rifles and their
single machine-gun. Show over, he squats in his faded black jump
suit, puffs a cigarette and says that for the first time since
flying here to fight for his dream of a free homeland he is truly
scared.
	   ``The Serbs might let the refugees out of here, but there's
nowhere that I can go,'' he says, reflecting the fears of no escape
that trouble all ethnic Albanian men of fighting age trapped behind
enemy lines.
	   Pushed out of nearby towns in a crushing offensive by Serb
security forces this week, Niki's group hides in the hills, trying
to dodge the advance of enemy tanks and infantry.
	   On the innumerable roads and trails that wind out of the region,
Serbs with black ski masks and machine guns wait in ambush for
their artillery and tanks to flush the guerrillas into the open.
	   A rapid Serb advance in the past week has gutted buildings in as
many as 20 Drenica villages and sent refugees streaming to nearby
towns and cities.
	   Amid distant shelling Saturday, the U.N. refugee agency chief
visited a pocket of about 2,000 refugees on the edge of Drenica,
describing many of the children as so traumatized ``they were
almost in a coma.''
	   Sadako Ogata also called on Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic during their meeting Friday to halt the fighting and help
the refugees.
	   ``I have told Milosevic about burning of houses and I told him
that this is unacceptable,'' she said. ``He agreed, but ... there
are no guarantees that repressive measures will stop.''
	   While Yugoslav reconnaissance jets thunder overhead and
artillery booms in the distance, Niki and three friends squat
around a plastic plate of green tomatoes, goat cheese and bread _
their first meal in two days.
	   In the Drenica offensive, police seized more than 300 men
accused of belonging to the KLA. Nobody knows how many more pockets
of guerrilla resistance remain hidden in the region.
	   Fresh Serb tank tracks scar the road that runs 100 yards from
Niki's bush hideout. With assault rifles no match for armor, hiding
is the best option, the guerrillas say.
	   ``It's not any good to shoot at tanks,'' said Niki. ``We don't
really have any weapons for war.''
	   Serb sources, although only occasionally reporting casualties,
said seven police died Friday in Drenica. The official Serb Media
Center said a land mine killed five driving in the area and two
died in combat.
	   KLA commanders in Drenica refuse to discuss their own
casualties.
	   Separatists in Drenica no longer speak of victory, so frequently
mentioned just two months ago before the Serb offensive
strengthened.
	   Ramo, the commander of Niki's guerrilla group, said his men's
plan of action amounts to squeezing off a clip of their dwindling
number of bullets when flushed out _ and then running.
	   ``We're not going to attack the Serbs,'' says Ramo, who also is
afraid to give his last name. ``But they'll attack us when we have
nowhere to go anymore.''

France takes 3-0 lead over Israel
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RAMAT HASHARON, Israel (AP) _ France moved into an unassailable
3-0 lead over Israel in the Davis Cup qualifying rounds when
Guillaume Raoux and Jerome Golmard won a three-set victory in the
doubles match against Noam Behr and Eyal Erlich.
	   The French pair triumphed 6-1, 6-4, 6-3 in front of 1,000 at the
Ramat Hasharon stadium Saturday and moved into next season's World
Group.
	   The result seemed assured from the outset. The more experienced
French duo, playing together for the first time, dealt with
blustery conditions while their opponents appeared naive,
presenting the Frenchmen with predictable returns.
	   Behr, 22, ranked 277th in doubles and Erlich, 21, ranked 198th
in doubles, often had trouble returning the powerful serves of
Raoux, 28, ranked 232nd and Golmard, 25, ranked 149th.
	   ``We played a solid match and won without extending ourselves,''
said Raoux after the match. ``This was our first time playing
together. We are capable of playing much better.''
	   The French team's coach, Yannick Noah, said the match was easier
than he expected. Referring to France's chances for the remainder
of the competition, he said it was the luck of the draw.
	   ``If we are lucky, we'll be drawn against the USA and (Andre)
Agassi will have a party while (Pete) Sampras will have a contract
elsewhere,'' he said.

Ultranationalist Serb leader wants closer ties to Serbia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with comments by defeated candidate
for Bosnian Serb presidency, minor edits. &QL; 
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The radical who won the
race for the Bosnian Serb presidency said Saturday that he would
work more closely with Serbia but also pledged to play by
democratic rules in office.
	   Nikola Poplasen is allied with the Bosnian Serb faction backing
war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic. His victory, announced Friday
by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, is
considered a blow to U.S.-backed attempts to encourage moderation
across Bosnia through financial aid to areas with political leaders
working to implement the 1995 Dayton peace agreement.
	   During the 3 1/2 year war and for the first years afterward,
Bosnian Serb radicals in charge pressed for union of the Serb part
of Bosnia with Serbia proper, something ruled out by the Dayton
provisions, which specifically mandate Bosnia as a nation made up
of the Serb substate and the Croat-Muslim federation.
	   The West worries that a Poplasen government would work against
Dayton provisions meant to restore a degree of ethnic tolerance and
introduce democracy to post-war Bosnia.
	   Poplasen, who ousted Western-backed incumbent Biljana Plavsic,
pledged with coalition partner Dragan Kalinic to preserve ``all the
good that the international community and the previous moderate
Serb government accomplished'' and to strive for a democratic
society based on a market economy.
	   The hard-liners congratulated moderate Zivko Radisic on winning
the Serb seat of Bosnia's tripartite presidency. Poplasen said his
dealings with Radisic have been ``correct and problem-free.''
	   Poplasen, who will appoint the premier-designate of the Bosnian
Serb substate, said he would listen to all suggestions and was
looking for a candidate ready to cooperate with other parliamentary
parties and the international community.
	   Plavsic congratulated her opponent on his victory.
	   Addressing the public through a live broadcast on an independent
television station late Friday, she said any reversion to the past
was impossible.
	   In Pale, the stronghold of Bosnian Serb ultranationalists,
Momcilo Krajisnik, the incumbent who lost to Radisic, poked fun at
Western efforts to install moderates in leadership positions.
	   ``It was amusing to watch certain officials investing more
effort in my losing than I invested in winning,'' he said.
	   Often blasted by foreign administrators in post-war Bosnia as
uncooperative and wishing to keep Bosnian Serbs as distant as
possible from others in the country, Krajisnik defended his record.
	   ``My aim was to protect the interest of Serb people,'' he said.
``I was never against Bosnia-Herzegovina, the country is a
reality.''

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin said
Saturday that reviving economic growth in Asia depends on regional
cooperation and financial reform.
	   Ending a three-day visit to China in its newest territory, Hong
Kong, Jospin called on Asian governments to strengthen their
dialogue with the rest of the world and ``avoid the temptation of
turning inward.''
	   ``The deteriorating international economic and financial
situation stands as a challenge'' to create growth and jobs without
sparking inflation, Jospin told a gathering of Hong Kong business
leaders and academics.
	   The prime minister flew to the territory Saturday from Shanghai,
where he said France's efforts to forge a ``constructive dialogue''
with China have led to improved human rights on the mainland.
	   Jospin pointed to the recent unprecedented visit by Mary
Robinson, the U.N. high commissioner for human rights, and China's
reform of its court system and steps toward adopting international
judicial standards.
	   Those signs of progress aside, Chinese police continued a
clampdown on democracy campaigners during Jospin's visit. At least
four dissidents have been taken into custody since Wednesday, the
eve of his arrival, although two were later released.
	   In Hong Kong, Jospin praised Beijing for not devaluing China's
currency and Hong Kong for not scrapping the 15-year peg linking
its currency to the U.S. dollar.
	   He also said increased regulation of financial institutions was
needed if the region is to overcome the recession.
	   Jospin's caution comes at a time when governments in the region
are threatening to curb the free flow of investment and capital.
	   Malaysia enforced sweeping currency controls this month to help
loosen monetary policy and reflate the sagging economy, while Hong
Kong spent an estimated U.S. dlrs 15 billion on a stock-buying
spree in an effort to hold market speculators at bay.
	   In a backhanded criticism of such moves, Jospin urged a
``respect for the rules of the international economic and financial
game,'' while suggesting a more prominent role for the
International Monetary Fund.
	   ``We must bolster the political legitimacy of the IMF and review
its practical forms of organization and operation,'' Jospin added.
	   Later, Jospin met with Hong Kong leader Tung Chee-hwa, who
reiterated that Hong Kong was committed to the maintenance of free
and open markets.
	   ``However, as the flow of capital becomes faster and freer
between nations, there is a need to have a new global arrangement
to monitor these movements,'' Tung said.
	   On Friday, Jospin met Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Hefei,
capital of the eastern province of Anhui, where the Chinese leader
was inspecting flood-recovery efforts.
	   Chinese-French relations have improved steadily since a rift two
years ago, when Paris irritated Beijing by selling Mirage fighter
jets to rival Taiwan.
	   An emphasis on business ties has helped foster better relations.
During Jospin's visit to China, French businesses signed 14
agreements worth 2.8 billion yuan (dlrs 339 million or 1.9 billion
francs).

Report: Algerian rebel group leader turns himself in to police
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ A young leader of a feared Islamic rebel
group called ``The Phalanx of Death'' has turned himself in to
police in western Algiera, a newspaper reported Saturday.
	   Ahmed Khelif, the 17-year-old joint leader of the ``Katibate el
Mout'' group, allied to the Armed Islamic Group, is accused by
authorities of carrying out hundreds of massacres of villagers this
year in western Algeria.
	   The newspaper La Tribune said Khelif turned himself in on
Thursday in Mascara, 400 kilometers (250 miles) west of Algiers.
There were no further details, but a government source, who
requested anonymity, confirmed the report.
	   His group is one of five rebel groups waging a battle with army
troops in the Saida mountains, 440 kilometers (275 miles) southwest
of the capital.
	   The fighting has lasted two weeks. There have been no reports of
deaths.
	   An estimated 75,000 people have died in Algeria during a
six-year Islamic insurgency sparked by the 1992 annulment of
legislative elections in which the now-banned Islamic Salvation
Front was heading for victory.
	   Earlier this week, authorities said 12 people died and 20 were
injured in three bombings and clashes between the army and Muslim
militants across the country.

Government tells court it cannot bring Murdoch to trial
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's foreign ministry told a local
court that it can not bring U.S. media baron Rupert Murdoch to
trial on obscenity charges in India because the extradition treaty
between the two countries does not cover such offenses, a domestic
news agency reported Saturday.
	   Two months ago, New Delhi Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Prem
Kumar ordered the foreign ministry to arrest Murdoch after he
failed to respond to summons issued a year ago at his addresses in
Australia and the United States, United News of India said.
	   The court was acting on a complaint that various channels of
Murdoch's STAR TV network were broadcasting obscene programming
which violated India's Obscene Representation of Women Act and were
a bad influence on young people.
	   In its response to the court order, foreign ministry officials
said compliance would be difficult because it involved the arrest
of Murdoch in the United States, which was not possible.
	   Indian society is largely traditional and many people see
Western television programming, which shows free interaction
between the sexes, as permissive. The views of conservative Indians
about what is considered obscene may differ largely from Western
perceptions.

US and eight European countries discuss measures for peace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RECASTS and UPDATES with more quotes on Kosovo intervention, adds

 &UR; By JOVANA GEC

<TEXT>
	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen on
Saturday signed an agreement establishing southeast European peace
force and warned Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic of NATO
intervention unless violence stops in Kosovo.
	   Signing the agreement with Cohen were defense ministers of three
other NATO countries - Italy, Turkey and Greece - and five
prospective alliance members in the Balkans - Macedonia, Slovenia,
Bulgaria, Rumania and Albania.
	   The new force is not envisaged for any military intervention,
but to have a ``humanitarian'' role _ truce keeping and aid relief
_ similar to the concept of United Nations multinational peace
forces.
	   Cohen called the signing ``historic,'' adding: ``This new,
multinational peace force holds out hope that we can build a new
era.''
	   But the meeting was also an occasion to highlight an option for
some radical peace-making by NATO, specifically in Yugoslavia's
larger republic, Serbia, where government forces have been fighting
with independence-seeking ethnic Albanians.
	   Hundreds of people have died and more than quarter of a million
have become displaced in Serbia's Kosovo province in violence that
erupted earlier this year.
	   ``In Kosovo, the fires of hate rule the relentless march of
ethnic violence,'' Cohen said. ``The time has come to face this
crisis directly.''
	   After a U.N. Security Council resolution authorized unspecified
further action in case government troops continued their offensive
in Kosovo, the defensive alliance late last week firmed up plans
for possible air and missile attacks.
	   ``I felt that we should take action sooner rather than later in
the event that Mr. Milosevic doesn't respond,'' to international
demands to halt offensives against the ethnic Albanian guerrillas,
Cohen said.
	   He also added that Serbians should not regard the possible
intervention as a hostile act but as a measure that would bring the
government and the nearly defeated separatist Kosovo Liberation
Army to the negotiating table.
	   ``We have to wait and see whether the NATO countries will look
to the Security Council and find enough legal foundation that would
warrant them joining in taking action,'' Cohen said. ``NATO
credibility is at stake and that NATO has to stand behind the
words, not just issue empty words,'' he added.
	   The host of the meeting, Macedonia, borders Serbia and fears a
spillover of violence into its territory. Macedonia has its own,
independence-minded and increasingly restive community of ethnic
Albanians.

<TEXT>
	   BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The Indian batsman Sachin Tendulkar
blasted his way to a new world cricket record Saturday.
	   As India beat Zimbabwe by eight wickets in their first one-day
cricket international at the Queens Club in the second city of
Bulawayo, Tendulkar became the first batsman to reach 18 centuries
in one-day internationals since this form of cricket was launched.
	   He slammed 127 not out in 130 balls, hitting 13 fours and a six
off the unfortunate Zimbabwe bowlers.
	   He also took part in a second wicket partnership of 176 with
Rahul Dravid who was content to play a passive but solid role for
his 64, using up 98 balls.
	   India's almost one-man show enabled them to inflict a morale
damaging
	   defeat over Zimbabwe. India were left with eight wickets and
almost eight overs to spare.
	   Mohamad Azharuddin had put Zimbabwe in to bat on an easy paced
wicket, thus showing little concern for his opponents' batting
capabilities.
	   He was proved right when Ajit Agarkar and Harbhajan Singh, in
taking three wickets each, reduced Zimbabwe to 160-8 at one stage.
The home skipper Alastair Campbell was the only one to show
aggression in scoring 53 off 41 balls.
	   Tailenders Paul Strang and Andrew Whittall managed a ninth
wicket partnership of 53 but it turned out to be a trumpet calls
against a cyclone as Tendulkar entertained a large local crowd with
his superb batting through a hot afternoon which was clearly to his
liking.
	   In going one up in the three-match series, India have stamped
their authority already and hardly anybody expects the possibility
of preventing a whitewash.
	   Tendulkar was not surprisingly named man of the match, but he is
actually man of the entire international one-day cricket history.
	   India also scheduled to play one five-day Test against Zimbabwe.

Arafat's drive to declare Palestinian state fraught with risk
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY193 &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GAZA CITY, Gaza Strip (AP) _ There's no such place as Palestine.
	   Legally and diplomatically, it doesn't exist. In the eyes of the
world, if not the Palestinian people, it's a would-be country, a
state of mind, a nation in waiting.
	   Now, Yasser Arafat says that wait is nearly over.
	   In a speech to the U.N. General Assembly on Monday, the
Palestinian leader is poised to make his boldest bid yet to turn
statehood dreams to reality a scant seven months from now.
	   For many Palestinians _ furious about stalled peace negotiations
with Israel and desperate over their ever-worsening economic plight
_ even a perilous step like this is better than leaving matters as
they stand.
	   ``It's time, it's time,'' said Abed Absi, 33, who runs a
hole-in-the-wall garment factory in one of Gaza City's sprawling
refugee camps. ``Look around _ even if we lose everything, what is
it that we really lose?''
	   Arafat has said for months that barring some negotiating
breakthrough, the Palestinians were likely to proclaim statehood as
soon as the interim Oslo peace accords expire _ on May 4, 1999,
according to the Palestinian interpretation.
	   Even if what he says on Monday doesn't differ greatly from
previous Palestinian statements, the setting dramatically raises
the stakes.
	   Until now, such talk largely has been viewed here as a
Palestinian bargaining tactic, meant to prod Israel into moving
ahead with long-delayed troop pullbacks.
	   But a direct appeal by Arafat for international support for an
independent Palestine _ delivered from center stage at the United
Nations _ carries far more symbolic weight.
	   And it comes come only four days after Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu used his own appearance before the world body to
deliver a blunt warning to the Palestinians: Don't do it.
	   ``Such actions will inevitably prompt unilateral responses on
our part,'' Netanyahu said Thursday.
	   Israel hasn't said publicly what its reaction would be, but
possible steps include annexation of West Bank and Gaza Strip land
still under its control, plus an economic boycott of the fledgling
state.
	   There is also considerable risk of violent confrontation. The
military establishments of both sides _ in veiled but unmistakable
language _ have acknowledged they are preparing for the possibility
of all-out warfare.
	   The Palestinians know they are hopelessly outgunned, but take
every opportunity to remind Israel that an impassioned popular
uprising can stand up to overwhelming military superiority. The
intefadeh, they say, proved that.
	   ``We will fight to defend our state and existence by all means
available,'' Palestinian intelligence chief Amin el-Hindi said last
week.
	   Despite the dangers, the looming showdown already could be
helping to break the long deadlock in Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations.
	   It may be no coincidence that the only real movement in months
comes as the Palestinians aggressively press their statehood cause:
Netanyahu on Friday formally confirmed for the first time he was
ready to accept a U.S. proposal for Israel to withdraw from an
additional 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   Both sides have reasons for wanting to abandon the Oslo accords,
and the statehood quarrel could provide a pretext for that.
	   Netanyahu has only grudgingly accepted the commitment to the
Oslo accords made by Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, and the
Palestinians have all but given up hope it can further their cause.
Sticking with the process also has eroded Arafat's street
credibility.
	   A wild card in the statehood maneuvering is Hamas, the militant
Islamic group that opposes any peace with Israel and has killed
scores of Israelis in suicide bombings.
	   Hamas says any statehood declaration that renounced claims to
all of present-day Israel would be unacceptable, but the group's
spiritual leader, Sheik Ahmed Yassin, said Palestinians shouldn't
fight among themselves about it.
	   ``Our enemy wants our Palestinian nation to have a civil war,''
he told a Hamas rally in Gaza on Thursday.
	   But money, not politics, could prove the greatest divisive
force. Palestinian planners hope formal statehood will boost
foreign aid and investment, but corruption and lack of
accountability in Arafat's Palestinian Authority already may have
cooled enthusiasm.
	   And statehood that failed to bring about real change in people's
daily lives could be disillusioning, and thus dangerous. That
already can be seen in Gaza, which has been self-ruled since
mid-1994.
	   ``With statehood, it'll be just like it has been so far with the
Palestinian Authority _ only a few will see the fruits, and the
rest of us will keep suffering,'' Gaza laborer Taysir Hamman said.
	   Arafat's personal agenda also could play a significant part in
the larger political drama.
	   Aging and ailing, he has devoted most of his life to the
Palestinian statehood struggle, and those close to him say he is
driven by the profound emotional desire to preside over the birth
of a nation.
	   Whipping up public support for May statehood could leave him
unable to back down even if Israel offered some otherwise
acceptable set of terms that slowed down the statehood timetable.
	   Israeli opposition lawmaker Yossi Beilin, a prime architect of
the autonomy accords, went to Gaza last week to plead with Arafat
not to push ahead with the statehood plan.
	   ``I think both sides are not really ready for what will happen
after the Palestinians make such a declaration,'' he said. ``I see
the fourth of May as the beginning of a tragedy.''

Villa stays No. 1; Di Canio shoves referee _ faces sanction
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Aston Villa got an early goal from Paul Merson to
stay undefeated and atop the Premier League with a 1-0 home win
Saturday over Derby as the Rams failed in a bid to move into first
place in England's top league for the first time in 23 years.
	   Elsewhere, defending league and F.A. Cup champion Arsenal
suffered its first lost of the season, falling 1-0 at Sheffield
Wednesday.
	   But the biggest news out of the game saw Sheffield Wednesday
striker Paolo Di Canio shoving referee Paul Alcock to the ground
after the Italian was ejected on a red card in the 44th minute.
	   The Italian, whose future in English soccer is now in doubt, was
given a red card along with Arsenal defender Martin Keown after a
free-for-all broke about between about a dozen players from each
team.
	   Newcastle continuted to be England's hottest team, winning 2-0
at home against Nottingham Forest as England international Alan
Shearer scored both _ his sixth goal in four games and his eighth
in the last six. It was Newcastle's fourth straight win under new
coach Ruud Gullit.
	   In north London, Tottenham and Leeds played a 3-3 draw with
Spurs defender Sol Campbell scoring in second-half injury time. The
match is likely to be the last at Leeds for coach George Graham,
who seems set to move to Tottenham.
	   In other matches Saturday in the Premier League: Charlton 1,
Coventry 1; Chelsea 2, Middlesbrough 0; Everton 0, Blackburn 0.
	   On Sunday, Wimbledon played at Leicester with Southampton
playing Monday at West Ham.
	   In England's first division, Sunderland moved into first place
with a 1-1 draw at Portsmouth. Huddersfield, which had been No. 1,
was beaten 3-0 at Bolton and was level on points with Sunderland
(19) but behind on goal difference.
	   In Scotland's Premier Division Saturday: Celtic 1, Hearts 1;
Dundee 1, Motherwell 0; Dunfermline 0, Rangers 2; St. Johnstone 1,
Dundee United 3.
	   Rangers lead with 15 points followed by Kilmarnock and Hearts
with 12 each.

Cabinet decides against pressing for dismissal of state government
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with cabinet deciding against
pressing for president's rule, minor edits. CHANGES byline. No

 &UR; By HEMA SHUKLA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's cabinet decided Saturday that it
will not press for federal rule over the eastern state of Bihar
since the president rejected its recommendation for the dismissal
of the state's socialist government, domestic news agencies
reported.
	   ``In deference to the wishes of the president, the cabinet
decided not to pursue the matter,'' Home Minister Lal Krishna
Advani said, the Press Trust of India reported.
	   The government wanted to fire elected officials on the basis of
a report by State Governor Sunder Singh Bhandari that said Bihar
was rife with ``financial mismanagement and failure of law and
order.''
	   Most lawmakers in the Bihar state legislature have criminal
records and have frequently been accused of switching political
loyalty in return for hefty bribes.
	   After four days of consultations with constitutional experts,
President K.R. Narayanan decided Friday that the situation in Bihar
did not warrant the dismissal of the government.
	   ``President K.R. Narayanan has upheld democratic and
constitutional provisions by returning to the Cabinet its
recommendation for imposition of federal rule in Bihar state,''
said Rabri Devi, Bihar's top elected official.
	   Narayanan's assent was necessary for the dismissal to be
enforced but he can turn down a Cabinet proposal only once. The
Indian constitution says if the Cabinet reiterates its decision,
the president will have no choice but to accept it.
	   The cabinet's decision came as a surprise because its members
were expected to wait for Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's
return from New York early next week before deciding on the next
move.
	   But Vajpayee asked the cabinet to resolve the matter
immediately, PTI said.
	   Opposition parties and allies of Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata
Party rallied in support of Devi's government Saturday.
	   There has been growing concern across parties in India at the
tendency of federal governments to dismiss popularly elected state
governments.
	   Narayanan is being hailed as a supporter of democracy and the
constitution. This is the second time in a year he has rejected the
Cabinet's proposal to dismiss a state government.
	   Meanwhile, India's autonomous election commission announced
Saturday that voting will be held in four states in November at the
end of five-year terms.
	   The elections will be a crucial test of popularity since
Rajasthan and Delhi states are governed by Vajpayee's BJP and
Mizoram and Madhya Pradesh by the main opposition Congress Party.

Tajikistan regrets U.S. decision to close embassy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Tajik Foreign Ministry said Saturday that the
U.S. government had decided to evacuate its embassy from the
Central Asian nation.
	   The ministry expressed its regret, Russian news agencies
reported.
	   ``The decision was announced at a time when Tajikistan's
government and local authorities had taken more measures to ensure
the security of the U.S. embassy in Dushanbe,'' the Tajik capital,
the ministry said in a statement quoted by the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   A U.S. embassy official told The Associated Press on Friday that
the United States was scaling back diplomatic activities and might
temporarily close the mission because of concerns about terrorism.
	   She said a final decision was expected soon, based on an
international reassessment of embassy security in response to the
recent bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa. The official spoke on
condition of anonymity.
	   The embassy is located in a hotel in central Dushanbe.
Tajikistan has been torn by violence between the government and its
political opposition, with fighting reaching the outskirts of the
capital on occasion.
	   Tajikistan also borders on Afghanistan, which the United States
has accused of harboring Osama bin Laden, the man suspected of
masterminding the bombings at the U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania.
	   Russian news agencies reported Friday that the United States had
decided to suspend operations at the embassy, while a skeleton
staff was continuing to work from the U.S. ambassador's residence.

	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The radical who won the
race for the Bosnian Serb presidency on Saturday said he would work
more closely with Serbia but also pledged to play by democratic
rules in office.
	   Nikola Poplasen is allied with the Bosnian Serb faction backing
war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic. His victory, announced Friday
by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, is
considered a blow against U.S.-backed attempts to encourage
moderation across Bosnia through financial aid to areas with
political leaders working to implement the Dayton peace agreement.
	   During the war and for the first years afterward, Bosnian Serb
radicals in charge pressed for union of the Serb part of Bosnia
with Serbia proper, something ruled out by the Dayton provisions,
which specifically mandate Bosnia as a nation made up of the Serb
substate and the Croat-Muslim federation.
	   Poplasen who ousted Western-backed incumbent Biljana Plavsic,
also criticized plans for a possible NATO strike in Serbia, in an
attempt to stop months of fighting between government forces and
Albanian guerrillas.
	   Serbia _ the main Yugoslav republic, which includes Kosovo
province _ would be justified in defending its territory in case of
such a scenario, he told reporters.
	   The West worries that a Poplasen government would work against
Dayton peace agreement provisions meant to restore a degree of
ethnic tolerance and introduce democracy to post-war Bosnia.
	   But on Saturday, Poplasen and his coalition partner, Dragan
Kalinic, pledged to preserve ``all the good that the international
community and the previous moderate Serb government accomplished''
and strive for a democratic society based on a market economy.
	   Unknown culprits _ apparently Poplasen backers _ celebrated
their candidate's victory early Saturday by spraying an office of
Plavsic's party with bullets in the northeastern town of Bijeljina,
the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA reported. No one was injured.

	   SKOPJE, Macedonia (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
signed an agreement establishing southeast European peace force
Saturday and warned Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic of NATO
intervention unless violence stops in Kosovo.
	   Signing the agreement with Cohen were defense ministers of three
other NATO countries, Italy, Turkey and Greece, and five
prospective alliance members in the Balkans: Macedonia, Slovenia,
Bulgaria, Romania and Albania.
	   The new force is not meant for any military intervention, but to
play a humanitarian role _ truce keeping and aid relief _ similar
to the concept of U.N. multinational peace forces.
	   Cohen called the signing ``historic,'' adding, ``This new
multinational peace force holds out hope that we can build a new
era.''
	   But the meeting was also an occasion to highlight an option for
some radical peace-making by NATO, specifically in Yugoslavia's
larger republic, Serbia, where government forces have been fighting
independence-seeking ethnic Albanians.
	   Hundreds of people have died and more than quarter of a million
have been displaced in Serbia's Kosovo province since violence
erupted earlier this year.
	   ``In Kosovo, the fires of hate rule the relentless march of
ethnic violence,'' Cohen said. ``The time has come to face this
crisis directly.''
	   After a U.N. Security Council resolution last week authorized
unspecified further action if government troops continued their
offensive in Kosovo, the defensive alliance firmed up plans for
possible air and missile attacks.
	   ``I felt that we should take action sooner rather than later in
the event that Mr. Milosevic doesn't respond,'' to international
demands to halt offensives against the ethnic Albanian guerrillas,
Cohen said.
	   He added that Serbians should not regard the possible
intervention as a hostile act but as a measure that would bring the
government and the nearly defeated separatist Kosovo Liberation
Army to the negotiating table.
	   ``We have to wait and see whether the NATO countries will look
to the Security Council and find enough legal foundation that would
warrant them joining in taking action,'' Cohen said. ``NATO
credibility is at stake and that NATO has to stand behind the
words, not just issue empty words,'' he added.
	   The host of the meeting, Macedonia, borders Serbia and fears a
spillover of violence into its territory. Macedonia has its own
independence-minded and increasingly restive community of ethnic
Albanians.

	   VASILEVO, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Four months ago, Niki was pouring
drinks in a bar in Germany and sending his savings to cushion his
parents' hardships in Yugoslavia's turbulent Kosovo province.
	   Now, he is surrounded by tanks, artillery and thousands of Serb
police and Yugoslav soldiers. Niki and other ethnic Albanian
separatist guerrillas are defending their last stand in the
mountainous Drenica region against an overwhelming force that vows
to crush them.
	   ``There are too many soldiers and too many police,'' says Niki,
24, who won't give his last name. He peers from the hilltop bushes
toward columns of dense smoke from Vasilevo and two other villages
that just fell to Serb tanks. ``We can't fight them.''
	   Drenica was the first region in Kosovo, a province of the
Yugoslav republic of Serbia, seized by the Kosovo Liberation Army
when fighting began in February. Its loss would crush the KLA's
morale. Since then, more than 700 people have died, almost 300,000
have fled their homes and a Serb scorched-earth campaign has laid
waste to much of western Kosovo.
	   Niki and fellow fighters ham it up for a few minutes for
visiting journalists, scowling and waving assault rifles and their
single machine-gun. Show over, he squats in his faded black jump
suit, puffs a cigarette and says that for the first time since
flying here to fight for his dream of a free homeland he is truly
scared.
	   ``The Serbs might let the refugees out of here, but there's
nowhere that I can go,'' he says, reflecting the fears of no escape
that trouble all ethnic Albanian men of fighting age trapped behind
enemy lines.
	   Pushed out of nearby towns in a crushing offensive by Serb
security forces this week, Niki's group hides in the hills, trying
to dodge the advance of enemy tanks and infantry.
	   On the innumerable roads and trails that wind out of the region,
Serbs with black ski masks and machine guns wait in ambush for
their artillery and tanks to flush the guerrillas into the open.
	   A rapid Serb advance in the past week has gutted buildings in as
many as 20 Drenica villages and sent refugees streaming to nearby
towns and cities.
	   Amid distant shelling Saturday, the U.N. refugee agency chief
visited a pocket of about 2,000 refugees on the edge of Drenica,
describing many of the children as so traumatized ``they were
almost in a coma.''
	   Sadako Ogata also called on Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic during their meeting Friday to halt the fighting and help
the refugees.
	   ``I have told Milosevic about burning of houses and I told him
that this is unacceptable,'' she said. ``He agreed, but ... there
are no guarantees that repressive measures will stop.''
	   While Yugoslav reconnaissance jets thunder overhead and
artillery booms in the distance, Niki and three friends squat
around a plastic plate of green tomatoes, goat cheese and bread _
their first meal in two days.
	   In the Drenica offensive, police seized more than 300 men
accused of belonging to the KLA. Nobody knows how many more pockets
of guerrilla resistance remain hidden in the region.
	   Fresh Serb tank tracks scar the road that runs 100 yards from
Niki's bush hideout. With assault rifles no match for armor, hiding
is the best option, the guerrillas say.
	   ``It's not any good to shoot at tanks,'' said Niki. ``We don't
really have any weapons for war.''
	   Serb sources, although only occasionally reporting casualties,
said seven police died Friday in Drenica. The official Serb Media
Center said a land mine killed five driving in the area and two
died in combat.
	   KLA commanders in Drenica refuse to discuss their own
casualties.
	   Separatists in Drenica no longer speak of victory, so frequently
mentioned just two months ago before the Serb offensive
strengthened.
	   Ramo, the commander of Niki's guerrilla group, said his men's
plan of action amounts to squeezing off a clip of their dwindling
number of bullets when flushed out _ and then running.
	   ``We're not going to attack the Serbs,'' says Ramo, who also is
afraid to give his last name. ``But they'll attack us when we have
nowhere to go anymore.''

Taylor: ex-warlord not worth harming U.S.-Liberia ties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos
 &UR; By TIM SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ Liberia's government allowed a fugitive
former warlord to be airlifted from the U.S. Embassy to ease the
strain on American-Liberian relations, President Charles Taylor
said Saturday.
	   One day after Roosevelt Johnson was choppered out of the seaside
compound under heavy guard, Taylor said that Johnson _ his main
rival _ was not worth the price of the diplomatic standoff.
	   ``At some point we made it very clear that Liberia and United
States relations were more important than Roosevelt Johnson,'' he
told reporters.
	   Johnson's evacuation from Liberia came after days of
negotiations between U.S. officials in Washington and Taylor's
government.
	   Taylor said that Johnson, who with 27 other people was flown to
a West African peacekeeping base in Freetown, Sierra Leone, has now
been imprisoned in Nigeria.
	   Two Johnson supporters who sought shelter at the embassy with
him have also been imprisoned. Most of the other evacuees are
believed to have stayed in Sierra Leone.
	   Taylor said Johnson and the two other men will be tried under
Liberian law, but that their eventual punishments will be decided
later. Liberian newspapers have said they would be tried in
absentia and returned to Liberia if found guilty.
	   Johnson fled to the embassy last Saturday during gunbattles
between his supporters and government forces seeking to arrest him.
As he was trying to convince embassy officials to harbor him,
Liberian commandos opened fire on his group, witnesses say, killing
at least three of his supporters and injuring two American security
officers.
	   Johnson and four others pushed their way into the embassy during
the gunbattle, leaving a reluctant embassy to protect him.
	   Fearing more fighting, security was greatly increased at the
embassy and most diplomats were evacuated.
	   Taylor made few comments about the embassy gunbattle, except to
say all shooting had occurred on Liberian territory _ not on the
embassy's grounds. While the shooting did begin just outside the
embassy gate, American diplomats have said the Liberians were on
American soil when the attack began, standing just inside a small
outer barrier.
	   Taylor also defended his actions against Johnson's supporters,
saying the former warlord had created his own mini-state in his
neighborhood stronghold, largely populated by his ethnic Krahn
followers.
	   Anywhere from 47 to 350 people were killed during two days of
fighting between government soldiers and Johnson supporters,
sending thousands fleeing the city center and leaving some
neighborhoods littered with war wreckage.
	   Johnson is to be tried with treason for allegedly attempting to
overthrow the Liberian government, as well as murder, rape and
kidnapping.
	   Taylor indicated that there may have been financial
considerations involved in the decision to arrest Johnson.
	   ``Since this thing happened, we've gotten assurances from
investors that now they are going to return to Liberia because
(they say) `You, President Taylor, are in charge now. You don't
have a President Taylor and a President Johnson.'''
	   Longtime rivals, Taylor and Johnson headed opposing factions
during Liberia's brutal seven-year civil war, which ended in 1996.
	   While the two men ostensibly made peace after Taylor was elected
president last year, Johnson's supporters and government soldiers
have repeatedly clashed over the past few months.
	   Liberia, a nation founded by freed American slaves, was for
years one of the largest U.S. aid recipients and hundreds of
American diplomats filled the sprawling embassy compound. Though
that aid fell off steeply with the end of the Cold War and the
beginning of the Liberian civil war, the United States earmarked
about dlrs 48 million for Liberia last year.

Argentine film wins top award at San Sebastian festival
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN SEBASTIAN, Spain (AP) _ The Argentine film `El Viento Se
Llevo Lo Que' (What's Gone with the Wind) won the `Golden Shell'
best film award at the 46th San Sebastian Film Festival in Spain on
Saturday.
	   The announcement by jurors was met with some booing and foot
stomping as the film, directed by Alejandro Agresti, was not among
those tipped to win any prizes by critics and cinema fans
attending.
	   The film deals with life in an isolated town in southern
Argentina where cinema is one of the only forms of entertainment
but where films arrive in such a poor state that they have to be
patched together by the projectionist giving rise to a certain
sense of chaos both in the movie and in the town.
	   Agresti said he ``cried and cried so much'' on receiving the
prize which he dedicated to Argentine cinema students who have
always supported him and the type of films he makes.
	   The festival's `Silver Shell' award for best actor went to
Briton Ian McKellen for his part in the U.S. film `Gods and
Monsters' while France's Jeanne Balibar was voted best actress for
her role in the French Film `Fin Aout, debut Septembre'.
	   The jury's special film prize was shared by Bill Condon's `Gods
and Monsters' and French director Robert Guediguian's `A La Place
du Coeur' while Spain's Fernando Leon de Aranoa was named best
director for his film `Barrio'.
	   The Mexican film `Un Embrujo' won the best photography prize.

Pumped-up Montgomerie leads German Masters; Singh two back
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) _ Colin Montgomerie shook off several
players with a late charge Saturday to grab a one-stroke lead after
the German Masters' third round.
	   Montgomerie, who pumped his fist in excitement when his fourth
straight birdie dropped at the 15th hole, held off Ireland's
Padraig Harrington by firing a 6-under-par 66 at the dlrs 1.68
million event.
	   The Scotsman, also driven by his late bid to finish as Europe's
leading money-winner for a record sixth straight year, finished
with a three-day total of 17-under 199.
	   Harrington, with a 67, was at 200 and PGA Championship winner
Vijay Singh and second-year pro Steve Webster of England were two
back at 201.
	   Singh, playing just behind Montgomerie, matched the Scotsman's
charge at first, dropping a seven meter (23 putt) in the midst of
three straight birdies.
	   But he fell behind, settling for a 69, when Montgomerie fought
his way out of a bunker at the 15th, then nailed a five meter (16)
foot putt for birdie.
	   The event was marred by a 35 minute delay when a spectator
suffered a heart attack at the 17th hole and subsequently died
while being airlifted to the hospital.
	   Montgomerie, who appeared out of the running during a mid-season
slump, has closed to dlrs 63,000 on Order-of-Merit leader Lee
Westwood of England. Three events remain to determine the year's
top money-earner.
	   Westwood started the day even with Montgomerie but fell six
strokes back at 205 after a wild round of par-72 that included two
straight bogeys and a later eagle.
	   The field pulled closer together as the morning rounds were
completed in perfect weather, while a shifting wind kicked up in
the afternoon when the leaders played.

Olano all but secures victory
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FUENLABRADA, Spain (AP) _ Spaniard Abraham Olano all but assured
himself of the Vuelta title Saturday, regaining the overall Spanish
tour lead with a second-place finish in the penultimate stage.
	   The Banesto team member, who sported the yellow jersey for most
of the 22-day tour, finished one second behind stage winner Alex
Zuelle and established an 83-second advantage over his nearest
rival entering Sunday's largely traditional ceremonial ride in and
around Madrid.
	   Zuelle, the two-time defending champion, won the 39-kilometer
(24-mile) individual time trial in 46 minutes, 36.03 seconds.
	   Olana, who lost the overall lead in Friday's final mountainous
stage, regained the yellow shirt from Jose Maria Jimenez and took
an virtually insurmountable lead of nearly a minute and a half over
countryman Fernando Escartin.
	   Escartin finished 13th in Saturday's stage, 1:56 behind Zuelle.
	   Jimenez, who led the tour after the sixth, seventh and eighth
stages, before losing it Olano, faltered Saturday and was third in
the overall standings, 2:12 back.
	   Regardless, Saturday's results virtually assured a Spanish sweep
of the top podium honors and, barring a catastrophe, guaranteed a
victory for the home country for the first time since Melchor Mauri
won the Vuelta in 1991.
	   American Lance Armstrong, who returned to the sport this season
after year-long absence due to testicular cancer, finished third in
Saturday's time trial, eight seconds off the winner, and moved into
fourth overall, 2:18 behind Zuelle and 19 seconds ahead of
top-ranked Laurent Jalabert of France.
	   The final stage will be held over 163 kilometers (101 miles)
starting and finishing in Madrid.

Slovak opposition fared well in elections, exit polls show

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Opposition leaders exulted Saturday
at the close of two-day national elections, jubilant at exit polls
that indicated they stand a strong chance of unseating Slovakia's
autocratic government.
	   Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's ruling party insisted the exit
polls were wrong.
	   Results from the parliamentary balloting, which international
monitors said appeared to have gone smoothly despite widespread
concerns, won't be released until Sunday.
	   But two series of exit polls sponsored separately by
pro-government and pro-opposition forces seemed to both bear out
what analysts had predicted: Meciar's nationalist Movement for a
Democratic Slovakia has little apparent chance to form a strong
enough coalition to stay in power.
	   Exit polls, based on interviews with voters as they leave
polling stations, are not always reliable reflections of ballots
cast. But if conducted properly they give a strong indication of
how the actual vote ran.
	   The headquarters of the opposition Slovak Democratic Coalition
erupted in wild cheering and applause as exit poll results were
announced on television. It scheduled formal coalition talks for
Sunday with three other opposition parties.
	   ``The opposition is going to get a majority of support in
Parliament,'' declared Mikulas Dzurinda, whose Slovak Democratic
Coalition led the apparently strong opposition showing, based on
the polls.
	   ``This is a vote for new hope and for a new beginning for
Slovakia,'' said Dzurinda, who stands to be prime minister if a
united opposition gets more than 50 percent of the 150 Parliament
seats that were up for grabs Friday and Saturday.
	   Both sets of exit polls showed six parties clearing the minimum
5-percent barrier required to gain seats. And both showed that the
four opposition groups among them, who have pledged to join forces
and oust Meciar, had the support of well over half the 28,000
voters jointly surveyed.
	   The MVK polling agency, whose survey was sponsored by
pro-opposition TV Markiza, showed the Slovak Democratic Coalition
beating the ruling party 30 percent to 22 percent, winning in all
regions of Slovakia. Its exit polls accurately reflected the
outcome of the last election won by Meciar's HZDS in 1994.
	   Even the more favorable results from the poll sponsored by state
television, which Meciar controls, showed his party with just 26
percent backing, in a virtual dead-heat with its main opposition
rival and without taking into account the other opposition parties.
Its sole likely ally, the far-right Slovak National Party, had just
10 percent.
	   Meciar's party declared that it will still top the list of 17
competing parties _ which would still give it the first formal
chance to try to put together a leadership coalition.
	   ``We are going to win in spite of all the polls,'' said party
vice-chairman Sergej Kozlik.
	   If it is bumped out of power, Slovakia would be headed for a
striking change after having been shunned by Western governments
and investors for its heavy-handed practices.
	   From the Danube River in the southwest to the rugged High Tatra
Mountains in the east, Slovak voters seemed enthusiastic about the
vote _ the second since the country split off from former
Czechoslovakia and became independent in January 1993.
	   Pensioners, businessmen and mothers with small children in tow
flocked to polling stations in the capital Bratislava, a bustling
old industrial city where featureless concrete buildings from
communist times mingle with more graceful architecture from its
days in the Austro-Hungarian empire.
	   More than 200 representatives of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe monitored the election. OSCE officials
said the voting process appeared to have gone well.

President's representative calls for letting mayor compete in vote
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin's
representative in the Far East region of Russia warned Saturday
that electoral officials risked mass unrest if they prevented the
incumbent from competing in mayoral elections in the Pacific port
of Vladivostok.
	   Hours before the polls were to open for Sunday's vote, electoral
officials were crossing Mayor Viktor Cherepkov's name off the
ballots, Russian state television reported. A city court ruled
Thursday that Cherepkov could not run in the election because he
illegally paid for his campaign with city money.
	   Cherepkov has appealed the decision, and the court has up to 10
days to consider the appeal. But the Vladivostok territorial
electoral commission annulled Cherepkov's registration on Saturday,
the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   Yeltsin's representative in the region, Viktor Kondratov, and
the regional parliament chairman Sergei Dudnik appealed to Yeltsin
to leave Cherepkov on the ballot in order to prevent unrest on
Sunday, ITAR-Tass said. Local police and medics were told to beef
up their presence and be ready for possible violence, the news
agency said.
	   The election has been delayed for months as Cherepkov has feuded
with regional governor Yevgeny Nazdratenko. Cherepkov's term
expired on July 5.
	   The regional government had Cherepkov ousted in 1994, only to
see him reinstated by Yeltsin two years later. The regional
parliament, backed by Nazdratenko, tried to throw out Cherepkov
last September _ again unsuccessfully.
	   Cherepkov and Nazdratenko have blamed each other for unpaid
wages to workers, chronic power cuts, and frequent labor protests.

Taylor: ex-warlord not worth harming U.S.-Liberia ties

	   MONROVIA, Liberia (AP) _ Liberia's government allowed a fugitive
former warlord to be airlifted from the U.S. Embassy to ease the
strain on American-Liberian relations, President Charles Taylor
said Saturday.
	   One day after Roosevelt Johnson was choppered out of the seaside
compound under heavy guard, Taylor said that Johnson _ his main
rival _ was not worth the price of the diplomatic standoff.
	   ``At some point we made it very clear that Liberia and United
States relations were more important than Roosevelt Johnson,'' he
told reporters.
	   Johnson's evacuation from Liberia came after days of
negotiations between U.S. officials in Washington and Taylor's
government.
	   Taylor said that Johnson, who with 27 other people was flown to
a West African peacekeeping base in Freetown, Sierra Leone, has now
been imprisoned in Nigeria.
	   Two Johnson supporters who sought shelter at the embassy with
him have also been imprisoned. Most of the other evacuees are
believed to have stayed in Sierra Leone.
	   Taylor said Johnson and the two other men will be tried under
Liberian law, but that their eventual punishments will be decided
later. Liberian newspapers have said they would be tried in
absentia and returned to Liberia if found guilty.
	   Johnson fled to the embassy last Saturday during gunbattles
between his supporters and government forces seeking to arrest him.
As he was trying to convince embassy officials to harbor him,
Liberian commandos opened fire on his group, witnesses say, killing
at least three of his supporters and injuring two American security
officers.
	   Johnson and four others pushed their way into the embassy during
the gunbattle, leaving a reluctant embassy to protect him.
	   Fearing more fighting, security was greatly increased at the
embassy and most diplomats were evacuated.
	   Taylor made few comments about the embassy gunbattle, except to
say all shooting had occurred on Liberian territory _ not on the
embassy's grounds. While the shooting did begin just outside the
embassy gate, American diplomats have said the Liberians were on
American soil when the attack began, standing just inside a small
outer barrier.
	   Taylor also defended his actions against Johnson's supporters,
saying the former warlord had created his own mini-state in his
neighborhood stronghold, largely populated by his ethnic Krahn
followers.
	   Anywhere from 47 to 350 people were killed during two days of
fighting between government soldiers and Johnson supporters,
sending thousands fleeing the city center and leaving some
neighborhoods littered with war wreckage.
	   Johnson is to be tried with treason for allegedly attempting to
overthrow the Liberian government, as well as murder, rape and
kidnapping.
	   Taylor indicated that there may have been financial
considerations involved in the decision to arrest Johnson.
	   ``Since this thing happened, we've gotten assurances from
investors that now they are going to return to Liberia because
(they say) `You, President Taylor, are in charge now. You don't
have a President Taylor and a President Johnson.'''
	   Longtime rivals, Taylor and Johnson headed opposing factions
during Liberia's brutal seven-year civil war, which ended in 1996.
	   While the two men ostensibly made peace after Taylor was elected
president last year, Johnson's supporters and government soldiers
have repeatedly clashed over the past few months.
	   Liberia, a nation founded by freed American slaves, was for
years one of the largest U.S. aid recipients and hundreds of
American diplomats filled the sprawling embassy compound. Though
that aid fell off steeply with the end of the Cold War and the
beginning of the Liberian civil war, the United States earmarked
about dlrs 48 million for Liberia last year.

Ultranationalist Serb leader wants closer ties to Serbia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Croats preventing Serbs from returning home.
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The radical who won the
race for the Bosnian Serb presidency on Saturday said he would work
more closely with Serbia but also pledged to play by democratic
rules in office.
	   Nikola Poplasen is allied with the Bosnian Serb faction backing
war crimes suspect Radovan Karadzic. His victory, announced Friday
by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, is
considered a blow against U.S.-backed attempts to encourage
moderation across Bosnia through financial aid to areas with
political leaders working to implement the Dayton peace agreement.
	   During the war and for the first years afterward, Bosnian Serb
radicals in charge pressed for union of the Serb part of Bosnia
with Serbia proper, something ruled out by the Dayton provisions,
which specifically mandate Bosnia as a nation made up of the Serb
substate and the Croat-Muslim federation.
	   Poplasen who ousted Western-backed incumbent Biljana Plavsic,
also criticized plans for a possible NATO strike in Serbia, in an
attempt to stop months of fighting between government forces and
Albanian guerrillas.
	   Serbia _ the main Yugoslav republic, which includes Kosovo
province _ would be justified in defending its territory in case of
such a scenario, he told reporters.
	   The West worries that a Poplasen government would work against
Dayton peace agreement provisions meant to restore a degree of
ethnic tolerance and introduce democracy to post-war Bosnia.
	   But on Saturday, Poplasen and his coalition partner, Dragan
Kalinic, pledged to preserve ``all the good that the international
community and the previous moderate Serb government accomplished''
and strive for a democratic society based on a market economy.
	   Unknown culprits _ apparently Poplasen backers _ celebrated
their candidate's victory early Saturday by spraying an office of
Plavsic's party with bullets in the northeastern town of Bijeljina,
the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA reported. No one was injured.
	   In another reflection of the ethnic tensions that prevail among
some Bosnians three years after the end of the war, around 50 Serbs
were prevented by Croats from returning to pre-war homes near the
southern city of Mostar.
	   Nobody was hurt in the confrontation. Still the incident served
as an example of how distant the right to free movement and return,
ensconced in the Dayton agreement, remained for many.

A look at Germany's national election
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: a version also moved on Friday &QL; 
 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   Key facts about Germany's national elections:
	   HISTORY: 14th national vote since German Federal Republic formed
in 1949, four years after Hitler's defeat.
	   WHAT'S AT STAKE: The 656-seat lower house of parliament, which
formally elects the new chancellor. This government will usher in
German capital's return to Berlin next year after decades of being
relegated to sleepy, provincial Bonn after World War II.
	   MAIN POLITICAL PARTIES: Conservative Christian Democrats and
center-left Social Democrats, biggest parties, only ones fielding
chancellor candidates. Also in parliament: Christian Social Union,
Bavarian sister party to Christian Democrats; Free Democrats, small
pro-business party also allied with Christian Democrats;
environmentalist Greens; Party of Democratic Socialism, successor
to East German communists.
	   CANDIDATES: Chancellor Helmut Kohl, 68, Christian Democrat,
running for unprecedented fifth term after 16 years in office.
Gerhard Schroeder, 54, Social Democrat, popular governor of Lower
Saxony state.
	   ISSUES: Jobs, with unemployment at postwar highs. Immigration,
with extreme-right parties screaming that foreigners are stealing
German jobs. Eastern Germany, economically depressed since Kohl
brought it into western fold in 1990, could swing national vote.
Both major parties agree on European Union and NATO expansion and
Jan. 1 introduction of single European currency. Election also is
personality contest between rotund, fatherly Kohl and slicker,
younger Schroeder.
	   POSSIBLE SURPRISE: Wolfgang Schaeuble, Kohl's designated heir,
could take over Kohl's party if chancellor loses. Wheelchair-bound
since a 1990 assassination attempt, the leader of the Christian
Democrats' faction in parliament is Germany's most popular
politician. He also could become chancellor in event of a Grand
Coalition, in which the major parties would share power. Kohl says
he'd never lead in cooperation with Social Democrats.
	   VOTER MOOD: Schroeder has seized on widespread dissatisfaction
with Kohl to create momentum for change. Kohl could benefit from
sense of uncertainty about economy and Germans' love of stability.
	   NUMBER OF VOTERS: About 60.5 million.

	   Saturday's matches in England's Premier League left Aston Villa
on top with 17 points through seven games followed by Derby with
12. Six clubs are tied with 11 points: Newcastle, Manchester
United, Leeds, Liverpool, Chelsea and Wimbledon. Arsenal has 10.
	   In detail, here's a look at the seven Premier League games:
 &UR; Aston Villa 1, Derby 0 (1-0) &QC; 
	   These are historic times for the Birmingham side. Paul Merson's
goal after 15 minutes assured the win. The 17 points after seven
games equals Villa's best start since World War II. It was Merson's
second goal in three games and makes his 6.75-million-pound (dlrs
11.3 million) transfer from Middlesbrough look like a bargain. The
victory should be a boost as Villa heads to Norway's Stromsgodset
with a 3-2 advantage in the UEFA Cup first-round, second-leg match
Tuesday. A victory would have moved Derby into first place for the
first time since 1975.
 &UR; Charlton 1, Coventry 1 (0-0) &QC; 
	   Each struggling side got something out of the match. Coventry,
which had scored only once in its last five games, got a goal.
Charlton, which had given up nine goals in three games, yielded
only one. Noel Whelan scored for Coventry in the 69th and Andy Hunt
equalized in the 74th.
 &UR; Chelsea 2, Middlesbrough 0 (0-0) &QC; 
	   Chelsea keeps rolling. This was the side's fourth straight
league win as Gary Pallister scored an own goal to make it 1-0,
heading in a shot from Chelsea's Brian Laudrup. Italian Gianfranco
Zola got the second in the 81st minute.
 &UR; Everton 0, Blackburn 0 (0-0) &QC; 
	   This was probably the worst match of the day with neither team
playing much good soccer. Swede Martin Dahlin was sent off in the
79th after a run in with Italian defender Marco Materazzi. Rovers
played without three top strikers _ Kevin Gallagher and Chris
Sutton injured and Kevin Davies ill in the hospital.
 &UR; Newcastle 2, Nottingham Forest 0 (1-0) &QC; 
	   Alan Shearer got them both as Newcastle's victory should put the
side in good spirits for its Cup Winner Cup game Thursday at
Partizan Belgrade. Shearer scored in the 11th and again in the 89th
on a penalty, giving him six goals in league matches.
 &UR; Sheffield Wednesday 1, Arsenal 0 (0-0) &QC; 
	   Lee Briscoe scored in the last minute to snatch the win for
Wednesday. But the match was overshadowed by Paolo Di Canio, who he
shoved referee Paul Alcock to the ground after being shown a red
card in the 44th for his part in a mild brawl between the two
clubs. Di Canio _ a 4.5-million-pound (dlrs 7.6 million) transfer _
was immediately suspended by Wednesday and the F.A. was expected to
act with added sanctions next week.
 &UR; Tottenham 3, Leeds 3 (1-2) &QC; 
	   Sol Campbell's goal in second-half injury time brought Tottenham
back from a 3-1 deficit and gained Spurs a valuable point. The
match was dwarfed by George Graham's move from Leeds to Tottenham,
which is reported to be all but signed and sealed. Gunnar Halle
gave Leeds a 1-0 lead in the 4th but Swiss Ramon Vega evened for
Spurs in the 14th. Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink and Clyde Wijnhard added
two more to give Leeds a 3-1 after 61 mintues. Steffan Iversen made
it 3-2 in the 71st, setting the stage for Campbell.

Montgomerie leads German Masters as Singh stung by late bogeys
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: RECASTS thruout, ADDS Singh's bogeys &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) _ Colin Montgomerie and Vijah Singh both
made late charges Saturday, but the Scotsman's nerves were steadier
as he seized a one-stroke lead after the German Masters' third
round.
	   Montgomerie, pumping his first in excitement after his fourth
straight birdie dropped on the 15th hole, fired a 66 and had a
total of 17-under-par 199. Ireland's Padraig Harrington was at 200.
	   Singh, who matched Montgomerie's string of four birdies, tumbled
out of the lead after being stung by a double bogey on the 17th and
another bogey on his final hole.
	   He finished with a 69, including one seven meter (23 foot)
birdie putt, and was two strokes back at 15-under 201 along with
second-year pro Steve Webster of England.
	   Montgomerie, obviously excited during his charge, is motivated
by his late bid to finish as Europe's leading money-winner for a
record sixth straight year.
	   Montgomerie, who appeared out of the running during a mid-season
slump, has closed to dlrs 63,000 on Order-of-Merit leader Lee
Westwood of England.
	   Winning the dlrs 1.68 million event would hurtle the Scotsman
past Westwood with just three events left to determine the year's
top money-earner.
	   Westwood started the day even with Montgomerie but fell six
strokes back at 205 after a wild round of par-72 that included two
straight bogeys and a later eagle.
	   The event was marred by a 35 minute delay when a spectator
suffered a heart attack at the 17th hole and subsequently died
while being airlifted to the hospital.
	   The field pulled closer together as the morning rounds were
completed in perfect weather, while a shifting wind kicked up in
the afternoon when the leaders played.
	   Australia's Rodger Davis, the oldest player in the field at 47,
fired a 9-under 63 to set a new course record.

Author Taslima Nasrin may seek bail to avoid arrest
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By FARID HOSSAIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Pursued by police, author Taslima
Nasrin is considering applying for bail before a higher Bangladeshi
court to avoid arrest ordered by a magistrate for offending the
sentiments of Muslims in her writings, her family said Saturday.
	   Nasrin has discussed with her lawyers the arrest warrant which
was revived when the author returned after four years of
self-imposed exile in Europe, a member of her family said speaking
on the condition of anonymity.
	   The 36-year-old writer is also facing threats to her life from
Islamic extremists. On her return, she immediately went into
hiding.
	   Her return has provoked street protests and renewed offers of a
cash reward of 200,000 takas (dlrs 5,000) to anyone who kills her.
	   The warrant for her arrest was revived Thursday after a Dhaka
resident, Joynul Abedin, renewed a complaint that Nasrin attacked
Islam in her book ``Nirbachitya Column'' or ``Selected Columns'', a
compilation of her newspaper writings.
	   The magistrate also ordered Nasrin's property to be confiscated
as punishment for failing to appear in court in the case filed in
1994.
	   Police said they were looking for the writer but failed to find
her.
	   The civil case is in addition to another criminal case filed in
1994 which accuses Nasrin of blaspheming Islam.
	   She was granted bail in the criminal case after which she fled
to Stockholm, Sweden, from where she traveled to other European and
U.S. cities to speak to writers and women's rights activists.
	   Nasrin said she risked her life to return home to be with `my
mother in her last days.'' Her 60-year-old mother, Eid-ul-Ara
Begum, has colon cancer.
	   Nasrin became a target of conservative Muslims after a newspaper
quoted her as saying that the Koran, Islam's holy book, should be
rewritten.
	   She has denied making the comments, but admitted she favored
changes in Islamic laws to give more rights to women in
predominantly Muslim Bangladesh.
	   Her novel ``Lajja'' or ``Shame'' criticized Muslims for
attacking minority Hindus after the destruction of a mosque by
Hindu zealots in neighboring India in 1992. Bangladesh banned the
novel, saying it incited religious violence.
	   Nasrin's critics want to introduce Islamic laws in Bangladesh, a
predominantly Muslim nation, which is governed by secular laws.

Slovak opposition fared well in elections, exit polls show
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By DAVE CARPENTER &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Opposition leaders exulted Saturday
at the close of two-day national elections, jubilant at exit polls
that indicated they stand a strong chance of unseating Slovakia's
autocratic government.
	   Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's ruling party insisted that the
exit polls were wrong.
	   Results from the parliamentary balloting, which international
monitors said appeared to have gone smoothly despite widespread
concerns, won't be released until Sunday.
	   But two series of exit polls sponsored separately by
pro-government and pro-opposition forces seemed to bear out what
analysts had predicted: Meciar's nationalist Movement for a
Democratic Slovakia has little apparent chance to form a strong
enough coalition to stay in power.
	   Exit polls, based on interviews with voters as they leave
polling stations, are not always reliable reflections of ballots
cast. But if conducted properly they give a strong indication of
how the actual vote ran.
	   The headquarters of the opposition Slovak Democratic Coalition
erupted in wild cheering and applause as exit poll results were
announced on television. It scheduled formal coalition talks for
Sunday with three other opposition parties.
	   ``The opposition is going to get a majority of support in
Parliament,'' declared Mikulas Dzurinda, whose Slovak Democratic
Coalition led the apparently strong opposition showing, based on
the polls.
	   ``This is a vote for new hope and for a new beginning for
Slovakia,'' said Dzurinda, who stands to be prime minister if a
united opposition gets more than 50 percent of the 150 Parliament
seats that were up for grabs Friday and Saturday.
	   Both sets of exit polls showed six parties clearing the minimum
5-percent barrier required to gain seats. And both showed that the
four opposition groups among them, who have pledged to join forces
and oust Meciar, had the support of well over half the 28,000
voters jointly surveyed.
	   The MVK polling agency, whose survey was sponsored by
pro-opposition TV Markiza, showed the Slovak Democratic Coalition
beating the ruling party 30 percent to 22 percent, winning in all
regions of Slovakia.
	   Its exit polls accurately reflected the outcome of the last
election, won by Meciar's HZDS in 1994.
	   Even the more favorable results from the poll sponsored by state
television, which Meciar controls, showed his party with just 26
percent backing in a virtual dead-heat with its main opposition
rival and without taking into account the other opposition parties.
Its sole likely ally, the far-right Slovak National Party, had just
10 percent.
	   Meciar's party declared that it will still top the list of 17
competing parties _ which would still give it the first formal
chance to try to put together a leadership coalition.
	   ``We are going to win in spite of all the polls,'' said party
vice chairman Sergej Kozlik.
	   If Meciar's party is bumped from power, Slovakia would be headed
for a striking change after having been shunned by Western
governments and investors for its heavy-handed practices.
	   From the Danube River in the southwest to the rugged High Tatra
Mountains in the east, Slovak voters seemed enthusiastic about the
vote _ the second since the country split from former
Czechoslovakia and became independent in January 1993.
	   Pensioners, businessmen and mothers with small children in tow
flocked to polling stations in the capital, Bratislava, a bustling
old industrial city where featureless concrete buildings from
communist times are interspersed with more graceful architecture
from its days in the Austro-Hungarian empire.
	   More than 200 representatives of the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe monitored the election. OSCE officials
said the voting process appeared to have gone well.

Argentine film wins top award at San Sebastian festival

<TEXT>
	   SAN SEBASTIAN, Spain (AP) _ The Argentine film `El Viento Se
Llevo Lo Que' (What's Gone with the Wind) won the `Golden Shell'
best film award at the 46th San Sebastian Film Festival in Spain on
Saturday.
	   The announcement by jurors was met with some booing and foot
stomping as the film, directed by Alejandro Agresti, was not among
those tipped to win any prizes by critics and cinema fans
attending.
	   The film deals with life in an isolated town in southern
Argentina where cinema is one of the only forms of entertainment
but where films arrive in such a poor state that they have to be
patched together by the projectionist giving rise to a certain
sense of chaos both in the movie and in the town.
	   Agresti said he ``cried and cried so much'' on receiving the
prize which he dedicated to Argentine cinema students who have
always supported him and the type of films he makes.
	   The festival's `Silver Shell' award for best actor went to
Briton Ian McKellen for his part in the U.S. film `Gods and
Monsters' while France's Jeanne Balibar was voted best actress for
her role in the French Film `Fin Aout, debut Septembre' (End of
August, Beginning of September).
	   The jury's special film prize was shared by Bill Condon's `Gods
and Monsters' and French director Robert Guediguian's `A La Place
du Coeur' (In the Place of the Heart) while Spain's Fernando Leon
de Aranoa was named best director for his film `Barrio'
(Neighborhood).
	   The Mexican film `Un Embrujo' (A Bewitchment) won the best
photography prize.

Sheffield Wednesday suspends Di Canio
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHEFFIELD, England (AP) _ Sheffield Wednesday suspended striker
Paolo Di Canio Saturday for shoving referee Paul Alcock to the
ground during Saturday's 1-0 victory over Arsenal.
	   Di Canio was given a red card in the 44th minute for his part in
a run-in among a dozen players from the two teams. Arsenal defender
Martin Keown was also given a red card in the incident.
	   The Italian striker threw a punch at Keown during the brawl.
When he was shown the red card, he lunged and pushed Alcock to the
ground.
	   ``We cannot condone any type of incident like that let alone
making contact with the referee,'' said Sheffield Wednesday coach
Danny Wilson, announcing the suspension. ``I do not know what was
going through his mind. He just lost it for a split second.
	   ``Obviously we have suspended him straight away as we felt we
needed to show people we understood the seriousness of the
incident.''
	   English F.A. spokesman Steve Double said it could get worse for
the Italian, who joined Wednesday on a 4.5-million-pound (dlrs 7.6
million) transfer.
	   ``This is clearly a very serious matter and we welcome the
prompt action that Sheffield Wednesday have taken,'' Double said.
``We would expect to receive Mr. Alcock's report on Monday and,
pending that, we will decide what action to take.''

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ Iran will develop a new missile that will
outdistance its predecessor, which is already capable of striking
Israel, Iranian Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani said Saturday.
	   Iran unveiled the Shahab-3 missile during a military parade
Friday. The newly developed weapon has a range of 1,300 kilometers
(800 miles), which means it can hit Saudi Arabia and Israel.
	   ``Certainly we will work on the development of the Shahab-4 and
5, but this does not mean we will start tomorrow,'' Shamkhani said.
	   In July, Assistant U.S. Secretary of State Martin Indyk said
Iran was working on the Shahab-4, which he called a greater threat
than its predecessor. He said the missile could be deployed in two
to five years and pledged that the United States would redouble its
efforts to curb the transfer of technology Iran needs to develop
it.
	   In Israel, Ephraim Sneh, a Labor Party member of the
Parliamentary Committee on Defense and Foreign Affairs, called for
a preemptory strike against Israel, the Army Radio reported.
	   It quoted him as saying on Saturday that Israel cannot sit by
while the world is being ``slack'' in dealing with Iran.

	   BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Sachin Tendulkar hit a record 18th
century in one-day internationals and led India to a eight-wicket
victory over Zimbabwe on Saturday in the first of their three-match
series.
	   Tendulkar hit an unbeaten 127 off 130 balls, hitting 13 fours
and a six.
	   He also led a second-wicket partnership of 176 with Rahul
Dravid, who was content to play a passive but solid role for his
64, using up 98 balls.
	   India's almost one-man show enabled them to inflict a morale
damaging defeat over Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe was bowled out for 213 in
their 50 overs before India replied by making 216 for two with 7.4
overs to spare.
	   Mohamad Azharuddin put Zimbabwe in to bat on an easy paced
wicket after winning the toss.
	   Ajit Agarkar and Harbhajan Singh took three wickets each,
reducing Zimbabwe to 160-8 at one stage. Captain Alastair Campbell
was the only bright spot for Zimbabwe, scoring 53 off 41 balls.
	   Tailenders Paul Strang and Andrew Whittall managed a
ninth-wicket partnership of 53 but it was Tendulkar who entertained
the large local crowd.
	   Tendulkar's 18th century moved him one past West Indian Desmond
Haynes, the all-time one-day international run leader who last
batted in a international match in 1994.
	   India and Zimbabwe play again Sunday and Wednesday before
meeting in a one-off test on Oct. 7.

Turkish police spray tear gas into bus filled with detained

protesters &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish riot police sprayed tear gas
into a police bus filled with about 30 demonstrators on Saturday,
television stations reported.
	   Hundreds of people calling themselves ``Saturday Mothers'' have
been holding weekly demonstrations in downtown Istanbul for nearly
three years to protest the disappearance of loved ones believed to
be in police custody. Holding pictures of the missing, they demand
that the government find them or account for their deaths.
	   On Saturday, riot police quickly encircled the demonstrators,
forcing them to board a police bus, private Star TV showed. The
demonstrators chanted ``honor of humanity will beat torture'' as
they boarded.
	   In order to silence the detained protesters, who kept on
chanting, the police sprayed tear gas into the bus.
	   Both Star and private Show TV broadcast footage of people
screaming and coughing as the bus was driven off.
	   It was not known if any of the demonstrators were treated for
tear gas inhalation.
	   After watching the protests silently and from a distance for
years, police started to crack down last month, saying the
gatherings are illegal. Hundreds of people have been arrested and
later released.
	   Turkey's independent Human Rights Association claims more than
800 people have disappeared, most after detention by security
forces.
	   Turkey is frequently criticized for human rights abuses,
including widespread torture by police. Turkey denies systematic
rights violations, and says that those suspected of abuses are
brought to justice.

Slovak opposition fared well in elections, exit polls show
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with precinct samplings showing opposition ahead.
 &UR; By DAVE CARPENTER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Opposition leaders exulted Saturday
at the close of two-day national elections, jubilant at exit polls
that indicated they stand a strong chance of unseating Slovakia's
autocratic government.
	   Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's ruling party insisted the exit
polls were wrong.
	   Results from the parliamentary balloting, which international
monitors said appeared to have gone smoothly despite widespread
concerns, won't be released until Sunday.
	   But two series of exit polls sponsored separately by
pro-government and pro-opposition forces seemed to both bear out
what analysts had predicted: Meciar's nationalist Movement for a
Democratic Slovakia has little apparent chance to form a strong
enough coalition to stay in power.
	   Exit polls, based on interviews with voters as they leave
polling stations, are not always reliable reflections of ballots
cast. But if conducted properly they give a strong indication of
how the actual vote ran.
	   The headquarters of the opposition Slovak Democratic Coalition
erupted in wild cheering and applause as exit poll results were
announced on television. It scheduled formal coalition talks for
Sunday with three other opposition parties.
	   ``The opposition is going to get a majority of support in
Parliament,'' declared Mikulas Dzurinda, whose Slovak Democratic
Coalition led the apparently strong opposition showing, based on
the polls.
	   ``This is a vote for new hope and for a new beginning for
Slovakia,'' said Dzurinda, who stands to be prime minister if a
united opposition gets more than 50 percent of the 150 Parliament
seats that were up for grabs Friday and Saturday.
	   Both sets of exit polls showed six parties clearing the minimum
5-percent barrier required to gain seats. And both showed that the
four opposition groups among them, who have pledged to join forces
and oust Meciar, had the support of well over half the 28,000
voters jointly surveyed.
	   The MVK polling agency, whose survey was sponsored by
pro-opposition TV Markiza, showed the Slovak Democratic Coalition
beating the ruling party 30 percent to 22 percent, winning in all
regions of Slovakia. Its exit polls accurately reflected the
outcome of the last election won by Meciar's HZDS in 1994.
	   Even the more favorable results from the poll sponsored by state
television, which Meciar controls, showed his party with just 26
percent backing, in a virtual dead-heat with its main opposition
rival and without taking into account the other opposition parties.
Its sole likely ally, the far-right Slovak National Party, had just
10 percent.
	   Separate samplings from MVK, based on initial vote counts from
300 of 500 precincts, showed the Slovak Democratic Coalition at
26.7 percent and Meciar's party at 25 percent.

Haarhuis, Eltingh keep Dutch in World Group
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EINDHOVEN, Netherlands (AP) _ Paul Haarhuis and Jacco Eltingh
clinched the Netherlands' place in next year's Davis Cup World
Group on Saturday with a 5-7, 6-1, 6-3, 6-7 (7-1), 6-4 victory over
Ecuador's Nicolas Lapentti and Andres Gomez.
	   A classic doubles tussle swayed back and forth between the
efficient team play of the top-ranked Dutch pair and inspired
rallying from the Ecuadoreans.
	   The victory gave the Netherlands an unassailable 3-0 lead in
their World Group qualifying round tie, after overwhelming singles
victories Friday by Haarhuis and Jan Siemerink.
	   The match was the final Davis Cup outing for Eltingh and
Haarhuis, who have won 38 tournaments together. Eltingh will retire
at the end of the year.
	   The Dutch marched to a 4-1 lead in the first set and the
22-year-old Lapentti had to save two break points to avoid going
5-1 down.
	   But the match turned, and inventive rallying from 38-year-old
veteran Gomez helped the Ecuadorean pair rally to break Haarhuis's
serve twice and take the set 7-5.
	   But at 1-1 in the second, the Dutch, playing much more fluently
as a team than their opponents, won nine straight games to tie the
match and take a 4-0 lead in the third.
	   There were no breaks in the fourth set and Ecuador ran away with
the tiebreaker, finished off with a Gomez top-spin lob.
	   But Lapentti's service loss in the first game of the final set
proved fatal. Eltingh, the only player to hold serve throughout the
match, served out at 5-4 to win his final Davis Cup match.

Controversial international chess tournament opens in Kalmykia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A controversial international chess tournament
opened Saturday in the Kalmykia region of southern Russia.
	   Some 2,000 players and guests from 157 countries were expected
to attend the annual chess Olympiad in the Kalmyk regional capital
Elista, said Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, the president of Kalmykia and head
of the World Chess Federation, FIDE.
	   The tournament is to last until Oct. 13, and the winners will
take home Kalmyk thoroughbred horses, Ilyumzhinov told the Interfax
news agency. His republic built a complex called Chess City to
house the tournament participants.
	   Human rights activists had urged players to boycott the
tournament in protest against Ilyumzhinov's alleged human rights
abuses and corruption. They accused the president of building Chess
City with federal funds that had been earmarked for industrial and
agricultural programs in Kalmykia, a Russian republic on the
Caspian Sea.
	   Ilyumzhinov has not been charged with any wrongdoing. But he has
come under close scrutiny from the Russian media since the June 7
stabbing death of Larisa Yudina, the editor of Kalmykia's only
opposition newspaper and an outspoken critic of the president.
	   Ilyumzhinov and his administration have denied involvement in
her death.

	   MELILLA, Spain (AP) _ Technicians searched Saturday for clues to
explain why a Spanish airline crashed in northern Morocco while
relatives began reclaiming the bodies of the 38 people killed in
the accident.
	   Moroccan and Spanish experts, helped by two technicians from
British Aerospace _ the company that built the plane _ fanned out
across the rugged terrain where the BAe-146 smashed into pieces
killing all aboard Friday morning.
	   They were unwilling to speculate why the 86-seater, belonging to
Spanish charter company Pauknair, flew into a hillside some 25
kilometers (15 miles) north of the tiny Spanish enclave of Melilla
where it was heading.
	   Spanish police chief Juan Cotino suggested human error might
have caused the crash just before 9.00 a.m. (0700 gmt), some 20
minutes after takeoff from the southern Spanish port of Malaga.
	   Meanwhile, medical teams in Melilla were still working to
identify the last of the victims from the human remains found among
the wreckage on an isolated promontory.
	   One of the Moroccan technicians, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that the two black boxes found Friday would not be
checked until the Moroccan-Spanish commission charged with
investigating the accident was fully formed.
	   An initial airline statement said mist may have complicated the
aircraft's approach to Melilla and newspapers speculated that the
pilot, who never communicated a distress signal, may have been
unaware that he was flying into the cliff because of faulty
instruments.
	   The Moroccan expert said the altitude meter had not been found.
	   The four-engine plane had passed a revision test in June and was
due to begin another one Sunday in London, news reports said.
	   Meanwhile, the search for human remains and personal effects was
being wrapped up with Moroccan military police drawing up an
inventory of the latest finds. These included the forearm of a
young woman, odd pieces of clothing and dozens of mobile phone
chargers.
	   The crash was the first involving a Spanish airline since 1985
when a Madrid-bound Iberia Airlines Boeing 727 hit a hill-top
television antenna in the northern city of Bilbao, killing 148
people.
	   The world's deadliest aviation disaster occurred on March 27,
1977 in Spain's Canary Islands when a KLM jetliner crashed into a
Pan American jumbo on the runway, killing 585 people.
	   The list of victims published Saturday in local newspapers
showed 18 were from Melilla, 10 from Malaga, one from Morocco and
the rest from other parts of Spain.
	   The coffins of the identified bodies were laid out in a
makeshift mourning center in the city sports pavilion with
curtained-off cubicles providing some privacy for mourners.
	   Enrique Palacios, mayor of Melilla, said a memorial service
Sunday would embrace the enclave's four religious cultures _
Christian, Muslim, Hindu and Jewish.
	   The president of the airline, Gerardo Pauknair paid his respects
to relatives of the victims Saturday.
	   ``I have no explanation for what happened because these are very
safe planes....so no hypothesis is discounted,'' the Spanish news
agency Efe reported him as saying.

India wins doubles to close to 2-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) _ Leander Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi, the
world's third-ranked doubles team, kept India alive Saturday in the
Davis Cup with a straight-sets win over the British pair of Tim
Henman and Neil Broad.
	   India won 7-6 (7-2), 6-3, 7-6 (7-3) to cut the deficit to 2-1 in
the best-of-five tie with the winner moving to the Davis Cup World
Group next season _ the elite 16 of men's tennis.
	   Britain, trying to get back into the World Group for the first
time since 1992, will send Henman against Paes _ the Indian No. 1 _
in Sunday's first reverse singles with Canadian-born Greg Rusedski
facing Bhupathi.
	   Henman attributed the win to India's clutch play in the two
tiebreakers.
	   ``They brought off some great shots at the right time and I
think they raised their game fractionally in both tiebreakers,'' he
said.
	   Added Broad: ``I don't think we played too badly but it's true
at times we did not combine too well and let a few shots go through
us down the middle.''
	   The Indian duo pointed out that all the pressure will be on
Britain in Sunday's singles.
	   ``We have a lot of work to do tomorrow. But anything is possible
in the Davis Cup and being 2-1 down is not a new situation for
us,'' said Paes, who had a match point before losing to Rusedski in
Friday singles.
	   ``I am not expected to beat Rusedski and all the pressure will
be on him,'' Bhupathi said.

Top UN refugee official visits refugees, calls for halt to violence
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Milosevic aide warning Yugo will defend itself
against any attack.
 &UR; By ALEKSANDAR VASOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The top U.N. official in charge of
refugees on Saturday visited shell-shocked victims of the
seven-month offensive against Kosovo separatists and urged
authorities to stop destroying villages.
	   ``I'm worried about winter,'' said Sadako Ogata, the United
Nations high commissioner for refugees. ``Time is against us and we
have to be as fast as possible.''
	   She voiced concerns of humanitarian aid organizations that many
of an estimated 50,000 refugees living in the open could grow ill
or die with the cold and lack of food in the coming winter.
	   They and more than another 200,000 refugees have fled their
homes since February when government forces launched a crackdown on
ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for independence of Kosovo, a
province of Serbia that is nonetheless 90 percent ethnic Albanian.
	   Concerns over possible mass deaths during winter have led to
increased international pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to order a halt to the offensive. NATO late last week
began planning for possible air and missile strikes, although no
specific attack plan has been made public.
	   Such actions have been met by defiance in the Milosevic camp.
	   Yugoslav Vice Premier Nikola Sainovic, speaking Saturday at an
officers' graduation ceremony at the Belgrade Military Academy,
reiterated the government's resolve to defend the ``integrity of
the country.''
	   And while he repeated government readiness for negotiations with
Kosovo Albanians he said the offensive against ``terrorism'' will
continue.
	   In Pristina, the ethnic-Albanian run Kosovo Information Center
said the bodies of 68 ethnic Albanians killed in the Drenica
offensive have been identified so far, including 10 bodies found
Saturday. Fifteen villages have been destroyed and 37 deserted, it
said.
	   After visiting about 2,000 people in a refugee camp in Resnik
village, 30 kilometers (18 miles) northwest of Pristina, Ogata said
about 20 of them were wounded and many children were so traumatized
they were ``almost in a coma.''
	   Shelling was heard in distance during her visit and police
manning a roadblock that leads to the refugee camp said hundreds of
guerrillas were still close to the camp.
	   Serb sources said seven policemen died in the ongoing offensive
against hundreds of rebels holed up in the central Kosovo region of
Drenica.
	   Officials from the Serb Media Center, which releases information
from Serb authorities, said five policemen were killed Friday after
driving over a land mine, while two died in combat.
	   Police, who detained and released several foreign journalists
Friday for routine questioning, denied access to Resnik to
reporters Saturday, despite invitations from the Ogata's agency to
accompany her.
	   Speaking to reporters Saturday, Ogata said she asked Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic while in Belgrade to halt the
destruction and cooperate with the international community to ease
the suffering of civilians.
	   ``I have told Milosevic about burning of houses and I told him
that this is unacceptable,'' said Ogata of her Friday meeting with
Milosevic. ``He agreed, but I will have to raise that issue again.
There are no guarantees that repressive measures will stop.''
	   Ogata was scheduled to meet later Saturday with Ibrahim Rugova,
Kosovo's top ethnic Albanian political leader. On Friday, gunmen
wounded an aide to Rugova, days after killing another associate, in
a possible attempt to warn Rugova to accept nothing short of
independence for Kosovo.
	   There have been indications that Rugova and Milosevic could sign
a U.S.-backed agreement that would give Kosovo a degree of
self-rule but would leave it part of Serbia and thus within
Yugoslavia as part of the Serbian republic.

Thousands rally to pay respects to dead Nigerian deportee
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS throughout to UPDATE with service ending, ADD police
apology. No pickup. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Thousands of people gathered at Saint
Michel cathedral in Brussels on Saturday for a service in memory of
a Nigerian woman who died this week after police tried to deport
her to Africa.
	   About 5,000 Belgians and Africans attended the two-hour service,
which included Christian and Muslim rites.
	   The cathedral was packed long before the ceremony began, and
thousands of onlookers stood outside to witness the arrival of
Semira Adamu's white coffin. Loudspeakers were placed outside for
people to hear the service.
	   No date has been fixed for Adamu's funeral. It was not
immediately known whether her remains will be flown back to Nigeria
or buried in Belgium.
	   Adamu, 20, died in a Brussels hospital Tuesday from a brain
hemorrhage, hours after police stuffed a pillow over her mouth to
restrain her on an airliner headed for Togo, in West Africa.
	   Her death caused a public outcry over Belgium's asylum policy
and plunged the government into crisis.
	   Interior Minister Louis Tobback announced his resignation
Friday, but he was asked by the government to reconsider. He was
expected to make an announcement later Saturday.
	   Tobback's decision came after he learned that one of the two
policemen who had tried to subdue Adamu was punished last year for
repeatedly kicking an asylum seeker.
	   The crowd at the cathedral was subdued. At the end of the
service, hundreds of people followed the car carrying Adamu's
coffin through Brussels.
	   Many were upset and angry but they finally dispersed outside the
hospital morgue where Adamu's remains were being held in the
inquiry.
	   Late Saturday, the police department issued a public apology for
Adamu's death. ''We are really sorry,'' said police spokeswoman Els
Cleemput. But she said it was up to the judicial authorities to
determine who was to blame.
	   ''As for an internal investigation, we cannot decide to open one
until we have all the evidence in hand. Some of the evidence,
including a videotaped recording of what happened on the flight, is
still in the hands of the judiciary,'' she said.
	   If Tobback were to confirm his resignation Saturday, it would be
the second time in five months the interior minister resigns. His
predecessor, Johan Vande Lanotte, stepped down after Marc Dutroux,
the key suspect in a pedophile case, briefly escaped.
	   Gino Russo, who has been campaigning for human rights since his
8-year-old daughter, Melissa, was starved to death in a basement
cell beneath Dutroux's house, also attended Saturday's ceremony.
	   ``She is a young woman who was legally murdered,'' he said.
``Like so many laws in this country, the law on asylum seekers is a
bad one.''
	   Adamu had resisted deportation five previous times. She claimed
her family was forcing her to marry a 65-year-old man who already
had three wives. Belgium argued that was not sufficient to grant
her refugee status.
	   On Friday, the World Organization Against Torture, a coalition
of human rights organizations, called on Belgium to abolish the
practice of using pillows to subdue deportees.
	   Cleemput said the practice was used twice last year. But she
said resistance from deportees increased this year and the police
have used the practice a dozen times already.

	   FLORIANOPOLIS, Brazil (AP) _ Gustavo Kuerten and Jaime Oncins
coasted past Romanians Andrei Pavel and Gabriel Trifu 7-5, 6-4, 6-4
Saturday and clinched Brazil's place in next year's Davis Cup World
Group with a 3-0 victory over Romania.
	   Kuerten, who beat Andrei Pavel on Friday in singles, and Oncins

Bayern Munich wins six straight, Kaiserslautern breaks rules
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROY KAMMERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Brazilian striker Giovane Elber scored with three
minutes to play Saturday against Werder Bremen to keep Bayern
Munich's record spotless in the Bundesliga.
	   With a workmanlike victory, Munich won its sixth straight to
open the season, one short of the league record the team compiled
in 1995-1996.
	   But defending champion FC Kaiserslautern let a two-goal lead
slip away in a 3-2 loss to VfL Bochum, while playing four
non-European Union members at the same time, which is against the
rules.
	   The mistake came after Danish defender Michael Schjoenberg broke
his leg in the 38th minute during a collision, weakening the team's
already suspect defense.
	   ``That was a shock for us, even for an old fox like me,'' said
Rehhagel, 61, explaining why he accidentally sent in Nigerian
Pascal Ojigwe.
	   ``It was a black day for Kaiserslautern. I've already apologized
to my players,'' he added.
	   Elber putted in a header that former German national team
defender Dieter Eilts failed to clear at the line to lift Munich,
which appeared to be hoarding its strength for the Champions League
match Wednesday against Manchester United.
	   Manchester's coach, Alex Ferguson, was in the stands to watch
the match.
	   Bayern moved five points clear, although several rivals also
posted wins and showed signs of regaining form after early season
slumps.
	   Bayer Leverkusen slipped past Schalke 1-0 as Ulf Kirsten, the
league's leading marksman the past two seasons, ended a scoring
drought with a 52nd minute goal.
	   Borussia Dortmund, aided by the recent return of Lars Ricken
from injury, also edged VfL Wolfsburg 2-1 and VfB Stuttgart beat
Moenchengladbach 3-2.
	   MSV Duisburg was also held to a 2-2 draw by Freiburg, while on
Friday second-place 1860 Munich beat Hertha Berlin 2-0 and
Hamburger SV won 1-0 against visiting Hansa Rostock.
	   Ricken, the hero of Dortmund's Champions Cup win two years ago,
beat the Wolfsburg defenders with a 27th-minute header.
	   But after Sead Kapetanovic equalized six minutes later, Dortmund
secured its win with former German national team player Thomas
Haessler converting a 66th minute penalty.
	   A pair of goals by Austria's Toni Polster wasn't enough for
Moenchengladbach to beat Stuttgart, which got a gamewinner from
Croatia's Zvonimir Soldoto with six minutes to play.
	   Stuttgart's two strikers, Jonathan Akpoborie and Fredi Bobic,
also scored for their team.
	   Kaiserslautern, unbeatable last season at home at the
Betzenberg, held a 2-0 lead after goals by Juergen Rische and Olaf
Marschall.
	   But Bochum, sending six players 22 or younger onto the pitch,
again exploited Kaiserslautern's shaky defense with goals by Thomas
Reis, South Africa's Delron Buckley and Slovenia's Emir Dzafic.

World hotspots on United Nations' plate

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Look around the world and pick a hotspot.
	   From Congo to Afghanistan, the Middle East to Cambodia, they all
get their turn at the podium during the U.N. General Assembly's
annual speechmaking-fest. And not all the words have been polite.
	   ``At this very moment, there are more than 30-odd cases of
conflict, civil war and disintegration of states, involving more
than 40 countries, with all the attendant suffering,'' lamented
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine.
	   In addition to the thousands killed, injured or missing, 22
million civilians in 118 countries receive help from the U.N.
refugee agency because they were forced to flee their homes or have
been repatriated, he said.
	   Virtually every conflict ends up on the doorstep of the United
Nations, which has nearly 15,000 troops trying to keep the peace in
17 flashpoints on four continents.
	   But as U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan said, the real
responsibility for making peace rests with the warring parties
themselves.
	   ``We can only appeal to the wisdom and the responsibility of
leaders to put the interests of their peoples over their own,'' he
said, decrying the increasing warfare in his native Africa.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright also blamed leaders
who choose violence over statesmanship.
	   Many of those leaders _ or their foreign ministers _ step to the
podium during the two-week General Assembly session, which ends
Friday. So far, there have been plenty of accusations but few
attempts at reconciliation.
	   India and Pakistan announced they planned to adhere to the
nuclear test ban treaty within the next year, which would slow the
South Asian arms race following their rival nuclear tests in May.
But the two countries were still sparring over Kashmir, the
contested Himalayan territory that has been the flashpoint for two
wars in the 51 years since the independent states were carved out
of the British empire.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu formally confirmed for
the first time that he was ready to accept a U.S. proposal to
withdraw from 13 percent of the West Bank.
	   But Yasser Arafat, previewing what he is expected to tell world
leaders Monday at the United Nations, has reiterated plans to
declare a Palestinian state in May despite Israeli objections.
Netanyahu warned that a unilateral declaration will sabotage the
Middle East peace process.
	   Since Turkey occupied northern Cyprus in 1974, the island nation
has been divided _ and there was no progress at the United Nations
on reunification. In a warning that tensions may escalate, Turkey's
Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz said the Greek Cypriot government's
decision to deploy new anti-aircraft missiles threatens to turn the
standoff on the island into a regional conflict.
	   The Congo accused neighboring Rwanda and Uganda of invading the
country, massacring thousands of innocent Congolese and destroying
billions of dollars in infrastructure. And Congo's foreign
minister, Jean-Charles Okoto Lolakombe, demanded to know why the
U.N. Security Council had a ``double standard'' and tried to
restore peace in Bosnia and Kuwait but remained silent about the
Congo crisis.
	   Rwanda and Uganda denied any invasion and shot back that Congo
was responsible for massacres. Rwandan U.N. Ambassador Gideon
Kayinamura accused Congolese President Laurent Kabila of
``corruption and nepotism.''
	   Afghanistan's Taliban religious army, which controls about 90
percent of the country, has no seat at the United Nations. The
Afghans who hold the U.N. seat don't control the government. So the
Taliban delivered its message at a news conference in the
correspondents' club: It said it must be included in any talks on
the country's future.
	   Cuba's foreign minister, Roberto Robaina Gonzalez, accused the
United States of trying to tighten ``the dirtiest and longest
economic war ever perpetrated against any country.''
	   Surveying the turmoil around the globe, Russian Foreign Minister
Igor Ivanov said the world had to overcome ``the vices, antagonisms
and stereotypes accumulated in the century about to end'' before it
could face the 21st century.
	   And he quoted from a Russian proverb: ``To be part of the world
you need to live in peace.''

EU, IMF say Russia must push ahead with finacial overhaul

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ European Union finance ministers surveyed
the global economic turmoil Saturday, urging Japan to push ahead
with banking reforms, praising Latin American governments and
telling Russia not to expect more handouts.
	   The EU said it would redirect aid programs for Russia to focus
on overhauling the banking and taxation system, but they made clear
no new money would be immediately forthcoming.
	   ``Some people have the impression that if you give Russia more
money, everything will be okay. Things just are not that simple,''
said Germany Central Bank President Hans Tietmeyer.
	   At the end of a two-day meeting in Vienna's Hofburg Imperial
Palace, finance ministers and central bankers from the 15 EU
nations said ``further restructuring of the banking sector in Japan
is of the utmost importance.''
	   They expressed concern that Latin American nations had been
contaminated by the turmoil blowing through emerging markets,
despite pursing ``essentially sound policies.''
	   ``We are confident on the prospects of Latin America and their
ability to overcome the current instability,'' the ministers said
in a statement.
	   The head of the International Monetary Fund, who joined the EU
meeting, repeated his view that the new Russian government must do
more to put its house in order before it receives the second slice
of a dlrs 22.6 billion IMF loan package.
	   ``The question is not just to see if the second tranche can be
released or not. It is to see if Russia can re-adjust its stance to
take account of the new situation,'' said IMF Managing Director
Michel Camdessus.
	   An IMF team is scheduled to return to Moscow Oct. 12 for
negotiations on releasing the loan.
	   Austrian Finance Minister Rudolf Edlinger, who chaired the
meeting of finance ministers and central bankers from the 15 EU
nations, said the Union's aid program, worth some dlrs 150 million
yearly, will now concentrate on sending experts to advise on
modernizing the banking, taxation and financial systems.
	   ``Any help to Russia has to be based on economic programs that
can be kept under control,'' Edlinger told a news conference.
	   The ministers expressed confidence Europe would escape the worst
of the economic troubles plaguing emerging markets, despite
forecasts showing slower-than-expected growth in some nations.
	   ``In the world economy today, the European Union is conspicuous
as a pole of stability,'' the 15 ministers said in a statement.
``Economic confidence is high and the outlook is for a continued
expansion of domestic demand, feeding through to sustained
growth.''
	   The statement comes as the EU seeks to boost the international
role of the economic bloc that 11 of their nations will form when
they adopt the euro as their shared currency on Jan. 1.
	   Ministers said the current economic troubles in emerging markets
showed the euro-zone needed a united voice on world financial
affairs to reflect its role as one of the of the world's largest
economic powers alongside the United States and Japan.
	   However they failed to agree on how the euro-zone should be
represented in international financial bodies such as the IMF or
the G-7 group of economic powers.
	   The euro-zone's current G-7 nations _ France, Italy and Germany
_ say they could represent the bloc along with the European Central
Bank. Smaller nations are demanding a place the top tables, with
Belgium suggesting they all designate a euro-zone president to
attend G-7 meetings.

	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Damage to the nation's
infrastructure and agriculture alone from Hurricane Georges will
surpass dlrs 1.2 billion, not including losses by industry and
businesses, Dominican officials estimated Saturday.
	   Many parts of the country remained isolated Saturday as roads
were impassable and flood waters were slow to recede. More than 200
are dead and many remain missing in what appears to be the country
hardest hit by Georges, which pounded island after island in the
Caribbean before churning off to threaten the United States
mainland.
	   The Americas International Airport outside Santo Domingo was
reopened Saturday morning and water service was restored to much of
the capital, said Temistocles Montas, aide to President Leonel
Fernandez.
	   Hugh Parmer, assistant administrator for the U.S. Bureau of
Humanitarian Response, said aid was arriving in Santo Domingo but
could not be distributed to many parts of the country by land. He
said relief flights to Barahona in the southwest, La Romana in the
southeast and San Francisco de Macoris in the north central area
would begin within 48 hours.
	   In addition to personnel and supplies from the United States,
aid began arriving from France, Spain, Italy, Canada, Chile and
other nations. The government also sought help from the World Bank
and other international agencies.
	   Tourism centers seemed to escape better than most of the
country, with only 5 percent of them damaged by the storm, said
Montas.
	   Some of the natural beauty that draws tourists will need time to
recover, however.
	   ``Our ecology has suffered serious damages from the severe
deforestation caused by the hurricane,'' said Omar Ramirez,
director of national parks.
	   He said 90 percent of the country's nature preserves were
affected by Georges.

	   MELILLA, Spain (AP) _ Technicians searched Saturday for clues to
explain why a Spanish airline crashed in northern Morocco, and
relatives began reclaiming the bodies of the 38 people killed in
the accident.
	   Moroccan and Spanish experts, helped by two technicians from
British Aerospace, which built the plane, fanned out across the
rugged terrain where the BAe-146 smashed down Friday morning,
killing all aboard.
	   They were unwilling to speculate about why the 86-seater
belonging to Spanish charter company Pauknair flew into a hillside
some 25 kilometers (15 miles) north of the tiny Spanish enclave of
Melilla.
	   Spanish police chief Juan Cotino suggested human error might
have caused the crash about 20 minutes after takeoff from the
southern Spanish port of Malaga.
	   Medical teams in Melilla were still working to identify the last
of the victims from the remains found among the wreckage on an
isolated promontory.
	   One of the Moroccan technicians, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that the two flight-data recorders found Friday
would not be checked until the Moroccan-Spanish commission charged
with investigating the accident was set up.
	   An initial airline statement said mist may have complicated the
aircraft's approach to Melilla and newspapers speculated that the
pilot, who never sent a distress signal, may not have known that he
was flying into the cliff because of faulty instruments.
	   The Moroccan expert said the altitude meter had not been found.
	   The four-engine plane passed a revision test in June and was due
to begin another one Sunday in London, news reports said.
	   Meanwhile, the search for remains and personal effects was being
wrapped up with Moroccan military police compiling an inventory of
the latest finds. These included pieces of clothing and dozens of
mobile phone chargers.
	   The crash was the first involving a Spanish airline since 1985,
when a Madrid-bound Iberia Airlines Boeing 727 hit a hilltop
television antenna in Bilbao, killing 148 people.
	   The list of victims published Saturday in local newspapers
showed 18 were from Melilla, 10 from Malaga, one from Morocco and
the rest from other parts of Spain.
	   The coffins of those who have been identified were laid out in a
makeshift mourning center in the city sports pavilion with
curtained-off cubicles providing some privacy for mourners.
	   Enrique Palacios, mayor of Melilla, said a memorial service
Sunday would embrace the enclave's four religious cultures _
Christian, Muslim, Hindu and Jewish.
	   The president of the airline, Gerardo Pauknair, paid his
respects to relatives of the victims.
	   ``I have no explanation for what happened because these are very
safe planes ... so no hypothesis is discounted,'' the Spanish news
agency Efe quoted him as saying.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Belgium's interior minister resigned
Saturday over the death of a Nigerian woman who died after police
tried to subdue her during her deportation, the Belgian news agency
reported.
	   Louis Tobback said he was stepping down from office, Belga
reported. A spokesman for the interior ministry could not
immediately confirm the report, saying he is still waiting to be
formally notified by his superiors.
	   The Socialist minister, who is also vice-premier, had announced
his plans to resignon Friday but was asked by the center-left
coalition government to reconsider his decision until Saturday.
	   Tobback's decision came after he learned that one of the two
policemen who had tried to subdue Semira Adamu had already been
punished by the police force last year for repeatedly kicking an
asylum seeker.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The top U.N. official in charge of
refugees on Saturday visited shell-shocked victims of the
seven-month offensive against Kosovo separatists and urged
authorities to stop destroying villages.
	   ``I'm worried about winter,'' said Sadako Ogata, the United
Nations high commissioner for refugees. ``Time is against us and we
have to be as fast as possible.''
	   She voiced the concern of humanitarian aid organizations that
many of an estimated 50,000 refugees living in the open could grow
ill or die with the cold and lack of food in the coming winter.
	   These and more than another 200,000 refugees have fled their
homes since February, when government forces launched a crackdown
on ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for the independence of Kosovo,
a province of Serbia that is 90 percent ethnic Albanian.
	   Concerns over possible mass deaths during winter have led to
increased international pressure on Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to halt the offensive. Late last week NATO began planning
for possible air and missile strikes, although no specific attack
plan has been made public.
	   Such actions have been met by defiance in the Milosevic camp.
	   Yugoslav Vice Premier Nikola Sainovic, speaking Saturday at an
officers' graduation ceremony at the Belgrade Military Academy,
reiterated the government's resolve to defend the ``integrity of
the country.''
	   And while he repeated government readiness for negotiations with
Kosovo Albanians he said the offensive against ``terrorism'' will
continue.
	   In Pristina, the ethnic-Albanian run Kosovo Information Center
said the bodies of 68 ethnic Albanians killed in the Drenica
offensive have been identified so far, including 10 bodies found
Saturday. Fifteen villages have been destroyed and 37 deserted, it
said.
	   After visiting about 2,000 people in a refugee camp in the
village of Resnik, 30 kilometers (18 miles) northwest of Pristina,
Ogata said about 20 of them were wounded and many children were so
traumatized they were ``almost in a coma.''
	   Shelling was heard in distance during her visit and police at a
roadblock that leads to the refugee camp said hundreds of
guerrillas were still nearby.
	   Serb sources said seven policemen died in the offensive against
hundreds of rebels holed up Drenica, a region in central Kosovo.
	   Officials from the Serb Media Center, which releases information
from Serb authorities, said five policemen were killed Friday after
driving over a land mine, while two died in combat.
	   Police, who detained several foreign journalists for routine
questioning Friday, later releasing them, denied reporters access
to Resnik on Saturday, despite invitations from Ogata's agency to
accompany her.
	   Speaking to reporters Saturday, Ogata said that when she was in
Belgrade, she asked Milosevic to halt the destruction and cooperate
with the international community to ease the suffering of
civilians.
	   ``I have told Milosevic about burning of houses and I told him
that this is unacceptable,'' said Ogata of her meeting Friday. ``He
agreed, but I will have to raise that issue again. There are no
guarantees that repressive measures will stop.''
	   Ogata was scheduled to meet later Saturday with Ibrahim Rugova,
Kosovo's top ethnic Albanian political leader. Gunmen wounded an
aide to Rugova on Friday, days after killing another associate, in
a possible attempt to warn Rugova to accept nothing short of
independence for Kosovo.
	   There have been indications that Rugova and Milosevic could sign
a U.S.-backed agreement that would give Kosovo a degree of
self-rule but would leave it part of Serbia and thus within
Yugoslavia.

BRUSSELS, Belgium: asylum seeker.

 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   Adamu, 20, died in a Brussels hospital last Tuesday from a brain
hemorrhage, hours after police had stuffed a pillow over her mouth
to restrain her on an airliner headed for Togo in West Africa.
	   Her death caused a public outcry over Belgium's asylum policy
and plunged the government into crisis.
	   Earlier, thousands of people gathered at Saint Michel cathedral
in Brussels for a religious ceremony in memory of Adamu.
	   Around 5,000 Belgians and Africans attended the two-hour
service, which included Christian and Muslim rites.
	   The cathedral was packed long before the ceremony began, and
thousands of onlookers stood outside to witness the arrival of
Adamu's white coffin. Loudspeakers were placed outside for people
to hear the service.
	   No date has yet been fixed for Adamu's funeral. It's unclear
whether her remains will be flown back to Nigeria or buried in
Belgium.

	   The crowd at the cathedral was subdued. At the end of the
service, hundreds of people followed the car carrying Adamu's
coffin through Brussels.
	   They dispersed outside the hospital morgue where Adamu's remains
are being held as part of the judicial inquiry.
	   Late Saturday, the police department issued a public apology for
Adamu's tragic death. ``We are really sorry,'' said police
spokeswoman Els Cleemput. She said it was up to the judicial
authorities to determine who was to blame for Adamu's death.
	   ``As for an internal investigation, we cannot decide to open one
until we have all the evidence in hand. Some of the evidence,
including a videotaped recording of what happened on the flight, is
still in the hands of the judiciary,'' she said.
	   Tobback's resignation Saturday is the second time in five months
a Belgian interior minister has resigned. His predecessor, Johan
Vande Lanotte, stepped down after Marc Dutroux, the key suspect in
a pedophile case, briefly escaped.
	   Gino Russo, who has campaigned for human rights since his
eight-year-old daughter Melissa starved to death in a basement cell
beneath Dutroux's house, also attended Saturday's ceremony.
	   ``She is a young woman who was legally murdered,'' he said.
``Like so many laws in this country, the law on asylum seekers is a
bad one,'' he added.
	   Adamu had resisted deportation five previous times. She claimed
her family was forcing her to marry a 65-year-old man who already
has three wives. Belgium argued that was not sufficient to grant
her refugee status.
	   On Friday, the World Organization Against Torture, a coalition
of human rights organizations, called in Geneva on Belgium to
abolish the practice of using pillows to subdue deportees which it
denounced as inhuman.
	   Cleemput said the practice was used twice last year. But she
said resistance from deportees increased this year and the police
have used the practice a dozen times already.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Belgium's interior minister resigned
Saturday over the death of a Nigerian woman who died after police
tried to subdue her during her deportation, the Belgian national
news agency reported.
	   Louis Tobback would be the second interior minister to resign
this year in the wake of a police scandal.
	   A spokesman for the interior ministry could not immediately
confirm Belga's report that Louis Tobback was stepping down from
office, saying he is still waiting for formal notification from his
superiors.
	   The Socialist minister, who is also vice-premier, had announced
his plans to resign on Friday but was asked by the center-left
coalition government to reconsider his decision until Saturday.
	   Tobback's decision came after he learned that one of the two
policemen who had tried to subdue Semira Adamu had already been
punished by the police force last year for repeatedly kicking an
asylum seeker.
	   Adamu, 20, died in a Brussels hospital last Tuesday from a brain
hemorrhage, hours after police had stuffed a pillow over her mouth
to restrain her on an airliner headed for Togo in West Africa.
	   Her death caused a public outcry over Belgium's asylum policy

	   No date has yet been fixed for Adamu's funeral. It's unclear

Daughter of ex-Beatle Sir Paul McCartney marries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Ex-Beatle Sir Paul McCartney became a chauffeur
for the day Saturday to drive his daughter to her wedding.
	   Mary McCartney, a 27-year-old photographer, married her
boyfriend, television producer Alistair Donald, at St. Peter and
St. Paul's church in Peasmarsh, a village in Sussex, south of
London, near the McCartney home.
	   Sir Paul drove the couple in a vintage car to and from the
church.
	   Mary wore a pink dress covered by thin, white embroidered
chiffon. Sir Paul's other children, fashion designer Stella and
student Jamie, also attended the service.
	   The couple announced their wedding plans shortly before the
death of Linda McCartney from breast cancer in April.

Panathinaikos beats Ionikos, moves to second place
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Norwegian striker Frank Strandli scored a
87th minute goal Saturday to give Panathinaikos Athens a 2-1
victory over Ionikos Nikea.
	   The victory, combined with Olympiakos Piraeus 1-0 loss to
Paniliakos Pyrgos away, put Panathinaikos in sole possession of
second place of the Greek first division soccer league with 12
points after five rounds.
	   AEK Athens beat OFI 1-0 on the island of Crete Friday to move to
the top of the standings with 13 points also from five games.
	   Panathinaikos, AEK and Olympiakos played earlier because of
their participation in European games Tuesday and Wednesday. The
other six games of the 5th round will be played Sunday.
	   Although Panathinaikos was more aggressive from the start of the
game, it was Ionikos who came close to open the scoring when a shot
by Scottish striker Graig-James Brewster hit Panathinaikos' left
upright in the 23rd minute.
	   Brewster stunned the 7,000 Panathinaikos supporters when he gave
his team the lead with a shot from inside the area off a pass from
Theodore Pahatouridis in the 36th.
	   Nikos Lymberopoulos exploited a defensive error to level in the
45th.
	   Three minutes before the final whistle, Polish striker Igor
Sypniewski gave to Strandli in front of Ionikos' goalmouth who
netted the winner. It was Strendli's third goal of the season.
	   Goalkeeper Socrates Kopsachilis saved a 71st-minute penalty
taken by Serbian midfielder Predrag Djordjevic to preserve
Paniliakos' 1-0 victory over Olympiakos.
	   In addition to the penalty, Kopsachilis made three other key
saves to shots by Serbian striker Ilija Ivic in the 7th and 21
minutes and by Dimitris Mavrogennidis in the 21st.
	   The hosts came close to open the scoring in the first minute
when Olympiakos' striker Grigoris Georgatos made a line save to a
header by Mohammed Sylla.
	   In the 50th, it was Yiannis Tatsis' turn to make a similar line
save to a shot by Olympiakos' Ghanaian striker Peter Oforiquaye.
	   Five minutes later, Vangelis Togias scored the game's only goal
off a center from Peruvian defender Augusto Charun.
	   Although it played without four of its key players, AEK
dominated the game against OFI on the island of Crete Friday.
	   Demis Nikolaidis' 21st minute goal off a pass from Dimitris
Markos gave AEK the victory.
	   OFI's Albanian goalkeeper Arian Beqaj made at least four key
saves to shots by the visitors.
	   The Athens club played with 10 players for 30 minutes when
Andreas Zikos saw a second yellow card for rough play in the 60th.
	   AEK's goalkeeper Chrisostomos Michailidis, who played in the
place of injured Ilias Atmatzidis, salvaged the victory with a
spectacular save to a powerful free kick by Nikos Nioblias in the
74th. It was OFI's only scoring opportunity in the 90-minute game.

Hurricane's homeless in Puerto Rico must leave shelters

	   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico (AP) _ Carlos Velez, his pregnant wife
Jarian and their three small children found refuge in the San Juan
Bosco grade school after Hurricane Georges peeled the zinc roof off
their home and drenched everything they own.
	   They received food and water, clothing and diapers _ and a
respite from the storm. But the hospitality is running out.
	   School resumes Monday, and shelters like this are closing down
all over Puerto Rico.
	   Many of the the almost 30,000 islanders driven from their homes
will be forced to take the next step in repairing their lives.
	   ``We're starting again,'' said Jarian Velez. ``It's like when we
got married.''
	   Hit by the hurricane on Monday, Puerto Rico was an early stop
along Georges' punishing sojourn through the Caribbean.
	   At least 300 people died and poor countries saw vast swaths of
agriculture wiped out in the storm which lashed Florida on Friday
and was bringing its 105-mph (170-kph) winds towards the U.S. gulf
coast.
	   In Puerto Rico, where three were killed, power and water were
shut off and damages reached at least dlrs 2 billion.
	   In San Juan's working-class Cantera district, low-lying streets
were still under nearly a foot of putrefying water on Saturday, and
home owners were becoming impatient.
	   Thirty neighborhood residents were still holed up in the San
Juan Bosco school, tired and anxious, their homes unlivable, their
futures uncertain.
	   Shelter worker Vicky Trujillo said they were the hard-core storm
victims _ not like some who showed up just for a free meal or some
other giveaway.
	   By Sunday the government housing agency is shifting them to a
nearby public auditorium, but it was unclear for how long, or what
happens next.
	   The beleaguered storm victims will share one big room, awaiting
further instructions, more aid, and perhaps a change in luck.
	   ``They offered us a lot of help, but we haven't seen anything
yet,'' said Gregoria Garcia, a 40-year-old single mother who said
she's washed her sole pair of underwear every day this week.
	   Garcia said she hopes power returns soon at her roofless
apartment so she can see if her rainsoaked television and washing
machine still work.
	   Julia Cepeda, who lives off food stamps and social security
along with a disabled husband and three young kids, received a dlrs
600 city check to repair her broken house.
	   It should be plenty to put back the metal roof and blown-out
windows, she said, but the work will take time.
	   In the meanwhile, said Cepeda, government largesse will have to
do.
	   ``As long as it takes,'' she said.

Brazilian sues city for incorrect HIV test
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) _ For nearly four years, Nadilson Martins
thought he was dying of AIDS.
	   Now he is suing the city of Angra dos Reis for 500,000 reals
(dlrs 310,000) claiming a municipal clinic got the test wrong.
	   ``The test completely destroyed my life,'' Martins said by
telephone from Angra dos Reis, a coastal city about 90 miles (150
kms) southwest of Rio. ``For four years I lived like I was dying. I
sold all that I owned and now I live in a shantytown.''
	   The 40-year-old, married father of two quit his job in 1994 as a
city councilor's aide, sold his house and returned to his
birthplace in northeastern Brazil to live out what he thought were
his final days, he said.
	   It was only late last year that a doctor persuaded Martins to
take a second test and found there was nothing wrong with him, he
said.
	   Town officials admitted Martins had an HIV test at one of its
clinics in February 1994, said the O Globo newspaper. No one was
available for comment Saturday.

Gunmen shoot dead two Mexico City police officers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A band of gunmen opened fire on two Mexico
City police officers in a patrol car killing them instantly,
authorities said Saturday.
	   A police report said the officers, patrolling the outside of a
subway station in the southeast neighborhood of Iztacalco to
prevent muggings, died late Friday.
	   The victims were identified only as Jose Luis Lopez Minor and
Anastasio Placido Ramirez, both members of a special city judicial
police unit trained to fight crime on the streets.
	   Witnesses said the gunmen opened fire on the patrol car and fled
_ two on a motorcycle and several more in a white automobile, the
report said.
	   Investigators found spent 9 mm and .45 caliber bullet casings
strewn on the street around the patrol car, but had no immediate
clues as to why the two officers were killed.

Parma deals Juventus first loss on Baggio goal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: TOPS with Parma-Juventus late match. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Dino Baggio netted AC Parma's first goal of the
Serie A season, dealing Juventus of Turin its first loss.
	   After two scoreless league outings, plus another shutout in UEFA
Cup action, Parma ended the drought on Baggio's sliding deflection
of a free kick in the 47th minute to edge the two-time defending
champions 1-0 under a heavy downpour Saturday night.
	   Juventus did not lose last season until Week 14.
	   The Turin club's misstep allowed Fiorentina to take sole
possession of first place on the strength of a 3-1 rout of AC Milan
earlier Saturday, as Argentine striker Gabriel Batistuta moved into
a tie for the league scoring lead with a hat-trick.
	   Batistuta scored six minutes after kickoff and then added two
goals early in the second half to win his personal battle with
German forward Oliver Bierhoff _ who scored on a late penalty kick
for Milan _ and give Fiorentina a perfect 3-0-0 start to the
season.
	   On an afternoon of outstanding individual performances,
Brazilian striker Marcio Amoroso tallied twice in the first seven
minutes to lead Udinese past Salernitana 2-0, while Marco
Delvecchio also had two goals by halftime in AS Roma's 2-0 win over
Venezia. Also Saturday, Bari and Bologna played a 0-0 draw.
	   Batistuta and Amoroso both have five goals, one more than
Bierhoff.
	   Fiorentina has nine points, two ahead of Udinese and AS Roma and
three more than Juventus and Milan.
	   At Parma, Baggio provided the brightest spot in a rain-plagued
game marred by sloppy play and several rough fouls. The Italian
international midfielder cut across the penalty area and, beating
Juve's Alessio Tacchinardi to the ball, barely got his leg on
striker Enrico Chiesa's looping free kick.
	   With French World Cup star Zinedine Zidane sidelined by a
nagging knee injury, Juventus had trouble constructing chances
against Parma's defense, which has yet to concede in a goal. Parma
raised its record to 1-2-0.
 &UR; Fiorentina 3, Milan 1 &QC; 
	   At Milan, Batistuta capitalized when veteran defender Alessandro
Costacurta accidentally lost the ball deep in his own territory.
The Argentine gathered the ball and sent a precise, right-footed
shot home to make it 1-0. Batistuta scored off Portuguese
midfielder Rui Costa's assist in the 46th minute and then sent a
free kick just under the crossbar in the 52nd.
	   Bierhoff, who led the league with 27 goals while playing for
Udinese last season, fixed the final score in the 69th.
 &UR; Udinese 2, Salernitana 0 &QC; 
	   At Udine, Amoroso slammed a pass from Belgian midfielder Johan
Walem into the roof of the net in the fourth minute and closed a
counterattack in the seventh for his second straight two-goal game.
Salernitana, playing in Serie A for the first time in 50 years, is
the only team in the league to have lost all its matches. Udinese
is 2-1-0.
 &UR; Roma 2, Venezia 0 &QC; 
	   At Rome, the hosts improved to 2-1-0 as Delvecchio _ making a
rare start in place of struggling forward Gustavo Bartelt of
Argentina _ scored 20 seconds into the game and again in the 14th
minute. Venezia is 0-1-2.
 &UR; Bari 0, Bologna 0 &QC; 
	   At Bari, South African striker Phil Masinga beat Bologna 'keeper
Francesco Antonioli with a header in the 39th minute, but a
defender salvaged the draw by blocking the ball at the line with
his body. Bari is 1-2-0, Bologna 0-1-2.
	   The games were pushed ahead of the rest of the schedule to
provide an extra day of preparation for clubs in UEFA Cup action
Tuesday.
	   Sunday's games see Internazionale of Milan at Empoli, Lazio of
Rome at Perugia, Cagliari hosting Sampdoria of Genoa, and Vicenza
at Piacenza.

Solo yachts set off on global odyssey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CHARLESTON, South Carolina (AP) _ Under sunny skies and a brisk
breeze, 14 sailors set off Saturday on a 43,500-kilometer
(27,000-mile) odyssey, sailing around the world alone.
	   Dozens of motorboats and other sailboats crowded the starting
line about 5 kilometers (3 miles) off Charleston as a replica of a
U.S. Civil War cannon boomed, starting the Around Alone sailing
race.
	   Sixteen boats will eventually compete, but two sailors remained
in Charleston on Saturday, making last-minute preparations.
	   The race got under way about 12:15 p.m. as the yachts slipped by
the starting line. The 11,045-kilometer (6,865-mile) leg to Cape
Town, South Africa, is expected to take about five weeks for the
fastest boat.
	   Earlier, several hundred people crowded the Charleston Maritime
Center as towboats jockeyed the yachts from the docks and pulled
them toward the harbor.
	   Neal Petersen, a South African native who moved to Charleston
after competing in the previous race, was the first to leave. He
stood on his red-hulled boat, waving while the crowd applauded.
	   The race, previously known as the BOC Challenge, has been held
every four years since 1982.
	   The course, which organizers like to call the longest race on
Earth in any individual sport, takes sailors around the world with
stops in Cape Town; Auckland, New Zealand; and Punta del Este,
Uruguay, before returning to Charleston next spring.
	   Eighty-seven skippers started previous races but only 56
finished. Two were lost at sea, including the last race when Harry
Mitchell and his 12-meter (40-foot) yacht disappeared amid
mountainous seas and near-hurricane winds.
	   There have been six at-sea rescues over the years. Isabelle
Autissier, who won the first leg of the 1994 competition, was
rescued after her yacht lost a mast. She is competing again this
year.
	   Markers have been set farther north in the Indian and southern
Pacific Oceans, keeping yachts clear of icebergs and within reach
of rescue teams.
	   Race director Mark Schrader said Australian officials wanted the
fleet, as much as possible, within 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles)
of the Australian coast as it passed.
	   Competitors are farthest from land crossing when between New
Zealand and Cape Horn.
	   All the yachts are equipped with the latest emergency
transmitters. And, for the first time, all the yachts are required
to have motors.
	   ``We did it for a safety issue _ if somebody has to get out of
the way in a flat calm of somebody, which is unlikely, or if
somebody has to motor to somebody, which also is unlikely because
these boats don't motor very well,'' Schrader said.
	   He said the motors might also be used when maneuvering at docks
at the stopovers. Race officials can tell if a skipper is using the
motor to gain an unfair advantage.
	   The race used to stop in Australia instead of New Zealand. The
change means yachts no longer have to navigate the shipping lanes
and oil derricks in the Bass Straits between Australia and
Tasmania.

Herbie Hide beats German challenger to retain WBO heavyweight title
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NORWICH, England (AP) _ Herbie Hide of England defeated German
challenger Willi Fischer Saturday to retain his WBO heavyweight
title.
	   Hide, who entered weighing 220 pounds (100 kilos), was
outweighed but not overmatched by the 231-pound (105 kilos) German.
	   Veteran referee Joe Cortez waved the contest over after the
moody 27-year-old, fighting in front of his home town fans, floored
Fischer for a third time just over a minute into the second round
of the contest.
	   Fischer first fell to a big left from Hide early in round two.
The German went down again following his mandatory eight count, and
he was sent to the canvas for the third and final time after a
sweeping left from Hide.
	   Before the fight, Hide said was aiming for a bigger fight
against either Lennox Lewis or Evander Holyfield.

Damage in Dominican Republic soars above dlrs 1 billion

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Damage to the nation's
infrastructure and agriculture from Hurricane Georges will surpass
dlrs 1.2 billion, which does not include losses by industry and
businesses, government officials estimated Saturday.
	   Many parts of the country remained isolated Saturday as roads
were impassable and flood waters were slow to recede. More than 200
are dead and many remain missing in what appears to be the country
hardest hit by Georges, which pounded island after island in the
Caribbean before churning off to threaten the United States.
	   The Americas International Airport outside Santo Domingo was
reopened Saturday morning and water service was restored to much of
the capital, said Temistocles Montas, aide to President Leonel
Fernandez.
	   Hugh Parmer, assistant administrator for the U.S. State
Department's Bureau of Humanitarian Response, said aid was arriving
in Santo Domingo but could not be distributed to many parts of the
country by land. He said relief flights to Barahona in the
southwest, La Romana in the southeast and San Francisco de Macoris
in the north central area would begin within 48 hours.
	   In addition to personnel and supplies from the United States,
aid began arriving from France, Spain, Italy, Canada, Chile and
other nations. The government also sought help from the World Bank
and other international agencies.
	   Tourism centers seemed to escape better than most of the
country, with only 5 percent of them damaged by the storm, said
Montas.
	   Some of the natural beauty that draws tourists will need time to
recover, however.
	   ``Our ecology has suffered serious damages from the severe
deforestation caused by the hurricane,'' said Omar Ramirez,
director of national parks.
	   He said 90 percent of the country's nature preserves were
affected by Georges.

Thousands of in-line skaters take to Paris streets

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Staking an ever greater claim to the streets of
Paris, about 5,000 in-line skaters raced through the capital on
Saturday, braving rain to mark ``Roller-City 98'' day.
	   Men and women, young and old, whizzed through the slippery, gray
streets, some dressed up as Mickey Mouse, others with their faces
painted.
	   In-line skating has become hugely popular throughout France in
recent years, with an estimated two million people commuting to
work on skates, or doing it just for fun.
	   On Saturday, the pack began their circuit at Montparnasse rail
station south of the River Seine and ended in Bercy, in eastern
Paris. Traffic was diverted from the route.
	   Some bus services also fell victim to the event. Leaflets stuck
on several bus stops apologized that there would be intermittent
service in the afternoon.
	   Every week, up to about 3,000 in-line skaters meet Friday nights
in Place d'Italie on Paris' Left Bank to start a 30-kilometer
circuit through the capital, each time following a different route.
	   To boost security, they are accompanied by a special squad of
police officers also on in-line skates. And to ensure the police
are up to scratch, they've been trained by professionals.

	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Pakistani Islamic groups said
Saturday that they were outraged that Iran had softened its stand
toward British writer Salman Rushdie.
	   While stopping short of revoking a death sentence against
Rushdie, Iran says it won't adopt any measures that threaten his
life, or anyone connected to his book -- The Satanic Verses. Nor
will Iran encourage or help anyone to do so.

on the leadership Saturday defeating last season's runner-up
Athletic de Bilbao 3-2 while defending league champion FC Barcelona
only managed a 2-2 draw against lowly Celta.
	   Real Madrid now has 10 points, three ahead of Arrigo Sacchi's
Atletico de Madrid, which trounced Real Sociedad 4-1, and Mallorca
which plays its fourth-round game Sunday against Oviedo.
	   Barcelona edges upwards with six points.
	   In other games Saturday, Valladolid sank Claudio Raineri's
Valencia 3-1 while Betis faced Extremadura in a late game.
	   Twenty-one-year-old Raul Gonzalez set Real on the road to
victory in the 13th minute when he took control of the ball at the
edge of the area and hammered it high past Bilbao keeper Imanol
Etxeberria.
	   Raul is the league's leading scorer with five goals.
	   Seven minutes on, Athletic equalized when Spanish international
Joseba Etxeberria sent over a cornerkick for Ismael Urzaiz to head
it past German 'keeper Bodo Illgner.
	   Bilbao missed a superb opportunity to take the lead six minutes
later when Urzaiz missed from the penalty spot.
	   Madrid hit home fast in the second half with a 54th-minute goal
by Yugoslav ace Pedrag Mijatovic while the side made sure of the
victory when Brazilian outside-left Savio made it 3-1 in the 58th.
	   Urzaiz had a second goal for Athletic annulled in the 69th
annulled for offside but Bilbao's dogged determination came through
when in the 81st minute Santi Ezquerro grabbed number two following
a defense fumble by Brazilian Roberto Carlos.
	   Bilbao stays with six points.
	   In Camp Nou, new Dutch centerforward Patrick Kluivert scored for
Barcelona in the 38th minute but five minutes later Celta's Michel
Salgado equalized. Kluivert then made it 2-1 in the 56th but
Russian midfielder Alexandre Mostovoi snatched the draw in the
final seconds of the game.
	   Atletico de Madrid took the lead against Real Sociedad with a
goal by Roberto Fresnedoso in the fifth minute on a shot five
meters (yards) off the line. Kiko Narvaez made it 2-0 in the 36th
minute and Jordi Lardin made it 3-0 with a penalty shot four
minutes before the break.
	   Uruguayan striker Fernando Correa sealed the victory with a
fourth in the 78th while Sociedad's Augustin Aranzabal garnered a
consolation netting from a penalty in the 89th.
	   Atletico now has seven points and moves into second.
	   Elsewhere, Valencia's Miguel Angel Angulo fired the first home
in the only to see Valladoild equalize with a goal by Russian Alen
Peternac while Javier Torres Gomez put the homeside ahead in the
38th minute and Alberto Lopez made it 3-1 in the 88th.
	   The remaining fourth-round games Sunday are: Tenerife vs.
Alaves; Deportivo de La Coruna vs. Espanyol; Villareal vs.
Salamanca and Zaragoza vs. Racing.

Feyenoord claims dramatic last-minute victory to stay top
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ It took until the last minute but
Feyenoord Rotterdam maintained its hundred-percent record in the
Dutch premiership Saturday, with a 3-2 win over Willem II Tilburg.
	   Feyenoord leads with 18 points, two ahead of Vitesse Arnhem
which slaughtered lowly Sparta Rotterdam 5-1, with two goals from
last season's European top scorer, Greek striker Nikos Machlas.
	   Argentinian striker Julio Ricardo Cruz confirmed his massively
improved form this season to pounce on a defensive error and put
Feyenoord ahead on 11 minutes.
	   But Moroccan Adil Ramzi also profitted from Feyenoord defensive
confusion to tie up the score on 37 minutes.
	   Feyenoord laid siege to the Willem II goal after Geoffrey
Prommayon was sent off just after the half, but it took until the
final minute until Cruz struck again.
	   Igor Korneev's penalty for Feyenoord just seconds later seemed
irrelevant until Huub Loeffen made it 3-2 in the sixth minute of
injury time.
	   Co Adriaanse, the Willem II coach, was sent to the stands by
referee Roelof Luinge on 77 minutes for illegal touchline coaching.
	   In Saturday's other games newly-promoted Cambuur Leeuwarden
booked its first win of the season, 2-0 over De Graafschap
Doetinchem.
	   Roda JC Kerkrade played a scoreless draw with RKC Waalwijk, NEC
Nijmegen downed SC Heerenveen 2-0 and MVV Maastricht won the
Limburg local derby with Fortuna Sittard 1-0.

Interior minister resigns over death of deportee
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with confirmation of Tobback's resignation, naming of
new interior minister &QL; 
 &UR; By ANNA SATHIAH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ Belgium's interior minister resigned
Saturday over the death of a Nigerian woman who died after police
tried to subdue her during her deportation, the minister's
spokeswoman said.
	   Dalila Douifi said King Albert II has formally accepted the
minister's resignation.
	   Luc Van Den Bossche, who held the position of minister of
education for the government of Belgium's Flemish-speaking
community, has been appointed to replace Tobback both as interior
minister and vice-premier.
	   Tobback is the second interior minister to resign this year in
the wake of a police scandal.
	   The Socialist minister had announced his plans to resign on
Thursday but was asked by the center-left coalition government to
reconsider his decision until Saturday. He confirmed his decision
to step down Saturday.
	   Tobback's decision came after he learned that one of the two
policemen who had tried to subdue Semira Adamu had already been
punished by the police force last year for repeatedly kicking an
asylum seeker.
	   Adamu, 20, died in a Brussels hospital last Tuesday from a brain
hemorrhage, hours after police had stuffed a pillow over her mouth
to restrain her on an airliner headed for Togo in West Africa.
	   Her death caused a public outcry over Belgium's asylum policy
and plunged the government into crisis.
	   Earlier, thousands of people gathered at Saint Michel cathedral
in Brussels for a religious ceremony in memory of Adamu.
	   Around 5,000 Belgians and Africans attended the two-hour
service, which included Christian and Muslim rites.
	   The cathedral was packed long before the ceremony began, and
thousands of onlookers stood outside to witness the arrival of
Adamu's white coffin. Loudspeakers were placed outside for people
to hear the service.
	   At the end of the service, hundreds of people followed the car
carrying Adamu's coffin through Brussels. They dispersed outside
the hospital morgue where Adamu's remains are being held as part of
the judicial inquiry.
	   No date has yet been fixed for Adamu's funeral. It's unclear
whether her remains will be flown back to Nigeria or buried in
Belgium.
	   Late Saturday, the police department issued a public apology for
Adamu's tragic death. ``We are really sorry,'' said police
spokeswoman Els Cleemput. She said it was up to the judicial
authorities to determine who was to blame for Adamu's death.
	   ``As for an internal investigation, we cannot decide to open one
until we have all the evidence in hand. Some of the evidence,
including a videotaped recording of what happened on the flight, is
still in the hands of the judiciary,'' she said.
	   Tobback's resignation is the second time in five months a
Belgian interior minister has resigned. His predecessor, Johan
Vande Lanotte, stepped down after Marc Dutroux, the key suspect in
a pedophile case, briefly escaped.
	   Gino Russo, who has campaigned for human rights since his
eight-year-old daughter Melissa starved to death in a basement cell
beneath Dutroux's house, also attended Saturday's ceremony.
	   ``She is a young woman who was legally murdered,'' he said.
``Like so many laws in this country, the law on asylum seekers is a
bad one,'' he added.
	   Adamu had resisted deportation five previous times. She claimed
her family was forcing her to marry a 65-year-old man who already
has three wives. Belgium argued that was not sufficient to grant
her refugee status.
	   On Friday, the World Organization Against Torture, a coalition
of human rights organizations, called in Geneva on Belgium to
abolish the practice of using pillows to subdue deportees which it
denounced as inhuman.
	   Cleemput said the practice was used twice last year. But she
said resistance from deportees increased this year and the police
have used the practice a dozen times already.

Griffith Joyner `ran a race faithfully won'

<TEXT>
	   LAKE FOREST, California (AP) _ With an Olympic flag hanging
behind the casket, Florence Griffith Joyner was remembered Saturday
as a champion who ``ran a race faithfully won'' and now has God as
``her coach.''
	   The two-hour funeral at Saddleback Community Church was filled
with a mix of affection and anger over accusations that Griffith
Joyner's record victories were aided by doping.
	   ``She stopped by to tell you all those jealous, venomous _ Oh,
I'm gonna tell it _ words can't harm me no more,'' her former coach
Bob Kersee shouted from a podium above Griffith Joyner's coffin,
which was bedecked with white flowers.
	   About 1,500 mourners, including former Olympics athletics
champions Bruce Jenner, Gail Devers and Kevin Young and retired pro
tennis player Zina Garrison were among those at the service.
	   Griffith Joyner, a dazzling, muscular runner known as FloJo,
captured three gold medals at the 1988 Seoul Games and set world
records that still stand for 100 and 200 meters. She denied using
performance-enhancing substances and never failed a doping test.
	   Griffith Joyner's sudden death Monday at age 38 refueled talk
about possible doping. The cause of death has not been determined.
	   ``I've heard a whole lot of bad things, but I don't hear too
many people saying what they've done wrong, what's hindering their
performance,'' said Kersee, whose wife, Olympic gold medalist
Jackie Joyner-Kersee, is the brother of Al Joyner, Griffith
Joyner's husband.
	   ``Florence stopped by here to tell you to take a look at
yourself,'' he said.
	   Kersee, recalling that Griffith Joyner ran a good race on and
off the track, gazed down at Mary Joyner, the 7-year-old daughter
of Griffith Joyner and Al Joyner, the 1984 Olympic triple jump
champion.
	   ``Mary, your momma wants you to know that those tarnishing,
poisonous lies can't hurt her no more,'' he said. ``So you don't
have to worry about that venomous, deadly scorpion sting of the
reporters. It don't hurt her no more. See God is protecting her.
See God is her coach now.''
	   Al Joyner, supported by his sister, Jackie, addressed his wife's
casket with his voice cracking and tears in his eyes.
	   ``I keep asking myself why did this happen,'' he said, pausing
to compose himself. ``One thing about Florence Griffith Joyner that
not everybody saw was she gave unconditional love. She was my
dream. I stayed focused on her for seven years until she looked my
way.''
	   Looking down at the casket, Joyner said, ``I'm going to miss
you. I love you.''
	   Telling mourners that Griffith Joyner always wanted Mary to
sing, Joyner introduced his daughter, who along with another young
girl, performed a song called ``When Wind Blew on Me.''
	   They received a standing ovation.
	   Carol Land, a longtime friend of Griffith Joyner, assailed what
she said has become a fixation on discrediting sports stars.
	   ``America has a trait of dishonoring people they had nothing to
do with rising,'' she said. ``If nobody else in America honors her,
I can say we did today. She was a woman of virtue. Florence shined
a light on America and they didn't give her due.''
	   William Hybl, president of the U.S. Olympic Committee, and Anita
De Frantz, vice president of the International Olympic Committee,
hailed Griffith Joyner's kindness and will to succeed.
	   The choir from Second Baptist Church in Santa Ana, where
Griffith Joyner attended, sang several rousing numbers and pop
singer Oleta Adams also performed. Griffith Joyner was buried in
Orange County.

Italy sweeps United States, heads to final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDREW BLASKO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) _ Diego Nargiso and Andrea Gaudenzi squandered
two match points in the third set before rallying for a 6-4, 7-6
(7-3), 5-7, 2-6, 6-3 victory over the United States on Saturday to
send Italy to the Davis Cup final.
	   The victory over Justin Gimelstob and Todd Martin completed a
3-0 sweep by Italy and put it against Sweden in the finals Dec.
4-6.
	   ``It's an unbelievable feeling. I never felt anything like this
before,'' Nargiso said.
	   The United States' loss marked the end of a winning streak of 18
home Davis Cup matches. They last lost in the United States in 1987
when Boris Becker led West Germany to a 3-2 victory in Hartford,
Connecticut.
	   ``It's something I never dreamed of and neither did our
players,'' U.S. captain Tom Gullikson said.
	   Italy's victory came a day after Guadenzi beat Jan-Michael
Gambill and David Sanguinetti upset Martin in the opening singles
matches at the Milwaukee Arena.
	   The doubles match Saturday went to five sets after Martin and
Gimelstob rallied in the third and fourth sets. Italy won the match
after Martin hit the ball long.
	   Italy last won the Davis Cup in 1976. It got to the semifinal
round last year, but was defeated by Sweden.
	   Gaudenzi and Nargiso had seen 2-0 leads crumble before. They
were on the team that lost to France in 1996 after winning the
first two matches.
	   But the United States has lost all but one of its 29 Davis Cup
ties after losing both opening singles. The only time the Americans
have ever overcame such a deficit in the Davis Cup was in 1934,
when they rallied to defeat Australia in Britain.
	   Sweden has played 11 Davis Cup finals since its first victory in
1975, when Bjorn Borg anchored the team. With six victories and
five runner-up finishes, Sweden is the most successful Davis Cup
nation the last two decades.
	   Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi and Michael Chang skipped the
tournament. Jim Courier, a member of the U.S. team, did not play
because an injured arm.

Indians said to be hurt by expanding drug trade in northern Mexico
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ADOLFO GARZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ The plight of indigenous peoples in northern
Mexico, where authorities have been largely incapable of stemming
the swelling drug trade, became apparent after a recent massacre of
two families near the Pacific port of Ensenada.
	   Fermin Castro, a Pai Pai Indian, was the target of the Sept. 17
attack, in which 18 men, women and children were gunned down at a
ranch near Ensenada, a popular resort city in Baja California
state, 50 miles (80 kilometers) south of the U.S. border.
	   Authorities believe Castro headed one of a growing number of
small independent smuggling bands that popped up in the region
after the Arellano Felix brother smuggling operation was forced to
adopt a lower profile.
	   Members of the Pai Pai and other Indian groups are believed to
have become involved in the drug-trade due to lack of economic
opportunity, local residents say.
	   Local authorities say Ensenada's geography is well suited for
drug-trafficking.
	   ``This is an efficient corridor. Sometimes they come up through
the Gulf and ship over dirt roads to the Pacific, or from the
Pacific to the Gulf. They land drugs in planes. They stand offshore
in ships and small boats bring the drugs into shore,'' Gen. Jose
Luis Chavez, the state representative of the Attorney General's
Office, said in an interview last week.
	   Castro, who was shot in the head and remains in a coma, was born
in the Pai Pai Indian community of Santa Catarina, in the Trinidad
Valley southeast of Ensenada, according to the respected Tijuana
weekly newsmagazine Zeta.
	   In this week's edition, Zeta reported other indigenous
communities in Baja California state are asking Gov. Hector Teran
to stop abuses by local police in Maneadero, a coastal town just
south of Ensenada.
	   Bernardino Julian Santiago, the local representative of an
indigenous organization that represents migrants from the southern
state of Oaxaca, said some police officers are supplying
clandestine drug houses, known as ``picaderos.''
	   In a letter to Teran sent earlier this month, Julian said his
people were tired of reporting police abuses to the Attorney
General's Office, and would take justice into their own hands if
the governor did not intervene.
	   Teran was unavailable for comment Saturday.
	   In a Saturday article, the Mexico City daily La Jornada said the
indigenous people of the Batopilas area in the northern state of
Chihuahua have been pushed to become involved in the drug trade.
	   The daily quoted a Roman Catholic priest, the Rev. Francisco
Chavez, the head of a local human rights organization, as saying
that local authorities have profited from inducing the local
Indians into growing drugs.
	   Chihuahua's indigenous population, which includes Tarahumara,
Tepehuanes and Raramuri Indians, is estimated at around 60,000.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Real Madrid looked to strengthen its hold
on the leadership Saturday defeating last season's runner-up
Athletic de Bilbao 3-2 while defending league champion FC Barcelona
only managed a 2-2 draw against lowly Celta.
	   Real Madrid now has 10 points, three ahead of Arrigo Sacchi's
Atletico de Madrid, which trounced Real Sociedad 4-1, and Mallorca
which plays its fourth-round game Sunday against Oviedo.
	   Barcelona edges upwards with six points.
	   In other games Saturday, Valladolid sank Claudio Raineri's
Valencia 3-1 while Betis drew 1-1 against Extremadura.

Former British hostage tells of rape ordeal at hands of gunmen in
</HEADLINE>
Chechnya

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Camilla Carr, one of two British hostages released
a week ago after 443 days held in captivity by gunmen in the rebel
Russian region of Chechnya, was repeatedly raped, The Mail on
Sunday reported.
	   The newspaper quoted Carr, 40, as saying that her ordeal lasted
for several months, although she never saw the face of her
assailant because all four gunmen who held her and fellow hostage
Jon James, 38, wore masks.
	   ``I believe that when the guard got to know us as people he
realized it was wrong to rape me. It stopped and he apologized to
me,'' the newspaper quoted Carr as saying in an extended interview
with both former hostages.
	   Both hostages were also threatened with torture and were victims
of mock executions, the newspaper said.
	   On Sept. 20, Chechen kidnappers released the two charity
workers, ending 14 months of captivity in the turbulent Chechen
republic in Russia's northern Caucasus region.
	   Carr and James were kidnapped in July 1997 while on a charitable
mission in Chechnya for a Quaker relief organization, the Center
for Peacemaking and Community Development.
	   James and Carr said that their love for each other saw them
through their captivity, when they were held in small rooms with
little natural light.
	   ``Our relationship matured and reached new depths,'' the
newspaper quoted Carr as saying. ``We are now so strong that we
will always be together.''
	   Scores of people have been kidnapped in or near Chechnya since
the end of the 1996 independence war with Russia. Most of the
kidnappings are carried out by armed criminal groups seeking
ransom.

	   LAKE FOREST, California (AP) _ With an Olympic flag hanging
behind the casket, Florence Griffith Joyner was remembered Saturday
as a champion who ``ran a race faithfully won'' and now has God as
``her coach.''
	   The two-hour funeral at Saddleback Community Church was filled
with a mix of affection and anger over accusations that Griffith
Joyner's record victories were aided by doping.
	   ``She stopped by to tell you all those jealous, venomous _ Oh,
I'm gonna tell it _ words can't harm me no more,'' her former coach
Bob Kersee shouted from a podium above Griffith Joyner's coffin,
which was bedecked with white flowers.
	   About 1,500 mourners, including former Olympics athletics
champions Bruce Jenner, Gail Devers and Kevin Young and retired pro
tennis player Zina Garrison were among those at the service.
	   Griffith Joyner, a dazzling, muscular runner known as FloJo,
captured three gold medals at the 1988 Seoul Games and set world
records that still stand for 100 and 200 meters. She denied using
performance-enhancing substances and never failed a doping test.
	   Griffith Joyner's sudden death Monday at age 38 refueled talk
about possible doping. The cause of death has not been determined.
	   ``I've heard a whole lot of bad things, but I don't hear too
many people saying what they've done wrong, what's hindering their
performance,'' said Kersee, whose wife, Olympic gold medalist
Jackie Joyner-Kersee, is the sister of Al Joyner, Griffith Joyner's
husband.
	   ``Florence stopped by here to tell you to take a look at
yourself,'' he said.
	   Kersee, recalling that Griffith Joyner ran a good race on and
off the track, gazed down at Mary Joyner, the 7-year-old daughter
of Griffith Joyner and Al Joyner, the 1984 Olympic triple jump
champion.
	   ``Mary, your momma wants you to know that those tarnishing,
poisonous lies can't hurt her no more,'' he said. ``So you don't
have to worry about that venomous, deadly scorpion sting of the
reporters. It don't hurt her no more. See God is protecting her.
See God is her coach now.''
	   Al Joyner, supported by his sister, Jackie, addressed his wife's
casket with his voice cracking and tears in his eyes.
	   ``I keep asking myself why did this happen,'' he said, pausing
to compose himself. ``One thing about Florence Griffith Joyner that
not everybody saw was she gave unconditional love. She was my
dream. I stayed focused on her for seven years until she looked my
way.''
	   Looking down at the casket, Joyner said, ``I'm going to miss
you. I love you.''
	   Telling mourners that Griffith Joyner always wanted Mary to
sing, Joyner introduced his daughter, who along with another young
girl, performed a song called ``When Wind Blew on Me.''
	   They received a standing ovation.
	   Carol Land, a longtime friend of Griffith Joyner, assailed what
she said has become a fixation on discrediting sports stars.
	   ``America has a trait of dishonoring people they had nothing to
do with rising,'' she said. ``If nobody else in America honors her,
I can say we did today. She was a woman of virtue. Florence shined
a light on America and they didn't give her due.''
	   William Hybl, president of the U.S. Olympic Committee, and Anita
De Frantz, vice president of the International Olympic Committee,
hailed Griffith Joyner's kindness and will to succeed.
	   The choir from Second Baptist Church in Santa Ana, where
Griffith Joyner attended, sang several rousing numbers and pop
singer Oleta Adams also performed. Griffith Joyner was buried in
Orange County.

Guerrilla chief proposes swap of 245 soldiers and police for jailed
</HEADLINE>
rebels &QL; 
 &UR; By VIVIAN SEQUERA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ In a letter received by President Andres
Pastrana on Saturday, Colombia's top guerrilla leader listed the
names of 245 soldiers and police officers held by his rebel group
and asked that they be exchanged for jailed insurgents.
	   Manuel Marulanda, commander of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia asked that Congress pass a law facilitating the prisoner
swap within 45 days. Pastrana should send an emissary to a southern
town in a region dominated by rebels to discuss details, he wrote.
	   Marulanda indicated he wanted the exchange to occur before a
peace dialogue begins. His letter was delivered by Andres Gonzalez,
governor of Cundinamarca, the state that includes Bogota.
Gonzalez's office said the FARC had promised a second letter within
days with a list of the jailed rebels the group wants freed.
	   Neither Pastrana nor Congress has said whether they intend to
accept Marulanda's proposal to legally enshrine a prisoner
exchange. The Justice Ministry says 925 rebels from various groups
are in Colombian jails. The 180 soldiers and 65 police officers
were captured in FARC attacks dating back to December.
	   The 34-year-old FARC is the hemisphere's oldest revolutionary
movement and Pastrana has agreed to demilitarize a 42,000
square-kilometer (16,200-square-mile) swath of southern Colombia
beginning Nov. 7 in order to facilitate peace talks.
	   The FARC, with an estimated 15,000 combatants, has never been
stronger and has since 1995 handed the military a string of
embarrassing defeats, leading some analysts to question its
sincerity.
	   The rebel movement has also been enriched by ``war taxes'' on
drug crops and, with other guerrilla forces, dominates more than 40
percent of Colombia's countryside.

	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Predag Mijatovic and Savio scored four
minutes apart early in the second half and Real Madrid went on to a
3-2 victory over Athletic Bilbao on Saturday, moving it three
points atop the Spanish Primera Division.
	   Raul Gonzalez had a first-half goal for Real, which improved to
3-1-0 and 10 points. Defending champion FC Barcelona slumped to a
2-2 draw with lightly regarded Celta and fell four points back.
	   Mallorca was the only team with a chance to keep pace with Real
Madrid, entering Sunday's game at home against Oviedo with seven
points.
	   In other games Saturday, Atletico Madrid trounced Real Sociedad
4-1, , Valladolid sank Claudio Raineri's Valencia 3-1 while Betis
drew 1-1 against Extremadura.
	   The rest of the fourth round was set for Sunday with Tenerife
vs. Alaves, Deportivo La Coruna vs. Espanyol, Villareal vs.
Salamanca and Zaragoza vs. Racing.
	   At Bilbao, 21-year-old Raul got Real started in the 13th minute
when he took control of the ball at the edge of the area and
hammered it high past keeper Imanol Etxeberria.
	   The goal was Raul's fifth and put him atop the league leaders.
	   Seven minutes later, Athletic equalized when Ismael Urzaiz
headed Joseba Etxeberria's corner kick past German 'keeper Bodo
Illgner.
	   Urzaiz missed a chance to equalize six minutes later, failing to
convert a penalty attempt.
	   Nine minutes into the second half, Madrid extended its lead with
Mijatovic scored and Brazilian outside-left Savio made it 3-1 in
the 58th.
	   Urzaiz was denied a second goal when a tally was annulled in the
69th annulled for offside, but Bilbao's determination paid off in
the 81st minute when Santi Ezquerro pulled it within one on a
miscue by Brazilian Roberto Carlos.
	   At Estadio Camp Nou, Dutch centerforward Patrick Kluivert scored
twice, but Russian midfielder Alexandre Mostovoi scored in the
final minute for the draw for Celta.
	   Kluivert gave Barcelona the lead in the 38th but Michel Salgado
equalized five minutes later. Kluivert gave Barcelona the lead
again in the 56th, a goal which held until Mostovoi earned Celta
(0-4-0) its fourth draw of the season.
	   At Madrid, four different players scored for Atletico, which
took the lead on Roberto Fresnedoso's shot five meters from the
line in the fifth minute and was never challenged.
	   Kiko Narvaez made it 2-0 in the 36th minute and Jordi Lardin
made it 3-0 on a penalty four minutes before the break.
	   Uruguayan striker Fernando Correa sealed the victory with a
fourth in the 78th while Sociedad's Augustin Aranzabal garnered a
consolation netting from a penalty in the 89th.
	   At Valladolid, Russian Alen Peternac and Javier Torres Gomez
scored two minutes apart to overturn an early goal by Miguel Angel
Angulo and pace Valladolid.
	   Angulo gave Valencia the early advantage in the 31st, but by the
38th Valladolid was on top 2-1 and onto to victory.
	   Alberto Lopez added another in the 88th.
	   At Seville, Ivan Perez Munoz appeared to give Betis the victory
in the 80th, but Primera division debutante Jean Franco Ferrari of
Peru equalized in the 87th.

Sutton takes Texas Open lead on final hole
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: NEW with Saturday's third round. &QL; 
 &UR; By KELLEY SHANNON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN ANTONIO (AP) _ Hal Sutton birdied the final hole with a
3-meter (10-foot) putt to cap a 5-under-par 67 Saturday and take
one-stroke lead over three golfers after the third round of the
Texas Open.
	   Justin Leonard, a co-leader with John Maginnes entering the
third round, was tied at 13-under 203 with Scott Gump and former
Texas Open champion Jay Haas.
	   Leonard recovered from a bogey on No. 12 to shoot a 69, while
Haas shot a season-low 64 and Gump had a 65.
	   Brad Fabel, who had a 70, and Mike Small, 68, were two strokes
behind Sutton.
	   Sutton, who began the day nine under, birdied Nos. 5, 7 and 9.
His next birdie came on the par-5 14th, where he two-putted from
about 6 meters (20 feet).
	   He bogeyed the 15th when he misread the green as his putt from
about 4 1-2 meters (15 feet) rolled 3 meters (10 feet) past the
hole. But Sutton regained his momentum on the par-4 16th by making
a putt from 7 1-2 meters (25 feet) and sealed his lead on the par-4
18th with another from 3 meters (10 feet).
	   Maginnes shot a 73 and was four strokes off the lead.
	   The players again battled hot, muggy conditions with afternoon
temperatures reaching the mid-90s.

Marsh takes second-round lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUGUSTA, Missouri (AP) _ Graham Marsh birdied three of the last
six holes in a 5-under-par 67 Saturday and took a one-shot lead
over Larry Nelson after two rounds of the Boone Valley Senior
Classic.
	   Walter Hall and Ed Dougherty each had a 66 Saturday and were two
shots behind Marsh's 10-under 134 total.
	   Nelson had eight birdies in his 65 and the threesome of Nelson,
Hall and Dougherty, who all had opening 70s, were a combined 19
under par for the day at the 6,731-yard Boone Valley Golf Club
course.
	   Marsh, who ranks 25th on the money list, had four birdies over
the first six holes, but double-bogeyed the par-3 128-yard
(115-meter) 8th hole when he hit his tee shot in the water.
	   Nelson, who is third on the money list with seven top-10
finishes, including two victories, said he changed putters
Saturday.
	   ``I made a couple of early birdies and gained confidence in my
putting as the round went on,'' Nelson said.
	   Hall said he and Dougherty were inspired by Nelson's three
birdies to start of their round.
	   ``I think we were all feeding off each other's round and were
inspiring each other,'' Hall said.
	   Mike Hill shot Saturday's low round of 64 after spending several
hours Friday night in the emergency room of a St. Louis Hospital.
	   Hill, who is three shots behind Nelson, said he feared he was
having a heart attack Friday night when he developed chest pains.
	   ``I spent three hours at the hospital and they didn't find
anything wrong,'' Hill said. ``But I'm so tired today I was able to
control my swing and not try to hit the ball too hard.''
	   First-round leader Gary McCord shot a 78 and was at 143.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ After one of the tightest races in postwar
Germany, voters Sunday choose a chancellor to shepherd Europe's
largest nation through historic changes: the government's move back
to Berlin, and the switch from the trusted German mark to the euro,
Europe's common currency. Chancellor Helmut Kohl, 68, who merged
communist East Germany with the West in 1990, is seeking an
unprecedented fifth term after 16 years in office. His appeal is
stability and his clout with world powers at a time of economic
turmoil in Russia and ongoing conflict in the Balkans. His
challenger, Gerhard Schroeder, 54, has campaigned as the voice of
change, appealing to Germans who feel the nation has stagnated
under Kohl, the West's longest-serving leader. (GERMANY-ELECTION)
	   BIG PINE KEY, Florida (AP) _ Hurricane Georges gathered strength
in the Gulf of Mexico on Saturday as it headed for the Mississippi
River Delta, leaving a trail of wreckage along the scenic Florida
Keys. Under the partly sunny sky, residents of Key West surveyed
the collapsed walls, missing roofs and other damage wrought by
winds of more than 100 mph (160 kph) Friday. Broken trees and
debris covered many of the other islands in the chain. ``The
coconuts were like cannonballs blowing in the wind,'' said Davin
Kusik, who lives at the Venture Out mobile home park on Cudjoe Key.
Parts of the chain of islands were expected to be without water and
electricity until at least Monday. After killing more than 300
people in the Caribbean, Georges took no lives in Florida.
(US-HURRICANE-FLORIDA)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Police beat up protesters and used
a water cannon Saturday to break up a huge gathering in downtown
Kuala Lumpur of supporters of ousted deputy prime minister Anwar
Ibrahim. There were no immediate reports of serious injuries, but
eyewitnesses saw policemen nab people from among the protesters and
kick them. Some were taken to parked police trucks and beaten.
Police also arrested dozens of people for shouting pro-Anwar
slogans or waving posters. There was no immediate comment from
authorities on the violence. Later, city authorities announced that
the Independence Square, the site of many recent demonstrations,
will be closed to the public for one week. Public protests, until
recently unheard of in Malaysia, are fast becoming routine.
(MALAYSIA-POLITICS)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian government negotiators will start talks
with investors on Tuesday over new terms for the state to repay its
enormous debt, the government announced Saturday. Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov chaired a closed-door meeting to discuss the
possible terms for Russia's repayment of billions of dollars worth
of treasury bonds held by Russian and foreign banks. The
cash-strapped government announced in mid-August that it would have
to set new terms and timing for repayment, in effect freezing the
bonds. In addition to Primakov, Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov,
Central Bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko, First Deputy Prime
Minister Yuri Maslyukov, and Economy Minister Andrei Shapovalyants
attended the meeting. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Opposition parties proclaimed
victory in Slovak elections even before the first official results
were released, calling a defeat of Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's
hard-line government inevitable. The four leading opposition groups
scheduled talks Sunday to try to form a governing majority. They
celebrated with champagne late Saturday, jubilant at exit poll
numbers and unofficial results that may signal the end of the
authoritarian rule that has dominated Slovakia throughout its
nearly six years of independence. But the political demise of
Meciar, whose anti-democratic practices have left Slovakia
diplomatically isolated in Central Europe, remained far from
certain. ``We are going to win in spite of all the polls,''
declared Sergej Kozlik, vice chairman of Meciar's Movement for a
Democratic Slovakia. (SLOVAKIA-ELECTIONS )

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Changing his name hasn't helped Prince Edward
deflect fame.
	   To get people to focus on his small film company, Ardent
Productions Ltd., Queen Elizabeth's youngest child calls himself
Edward Windsor. As in, Windsor Castle, the House of Windsor and the
Duke of Windsor.
	   ``The very fact that people always ask me about my title, means
that they're still hung up about it. They're not looking at the
programs we make, they're only looking at the title,'' Edward said
in Saturday's editions of The Washington Post.
	   Running the company is hard enough. Ardent lost money for its
first four years but is operating in the black today, he says. He
has made everything from soap operas to historical documentaries to
murder mysteries _ all for television.
	   While Edward, 34, admits his family's fame has helped him,
``probably the cons outweigh the pros,'' as people see him as a
prince rather than an artist or businessman.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Ex-Beatle Sir Paul McCartney became a chauffeur
for the day Saturday to drive his daughter to her wedding.
	   Mary McCartney, a 27-year-old photographer, married television
producer Alistair Donald, at St. Peter and St. Paul's church in
Peasmarsh, a village in Sussex, south of London, near the McCartney
home.
	   Sir Paul drove the couple in a vintage car to and from the

	   PITTSBURGH (AP) _ The world's first female grandmaster in chess
said girls are still missing out on the game because they are never
taught it.
	   Susan Polgar became a grandmaster in 1991 and once beat the
world's fifth-ranked player, Anatoly Karpov. She spoke Saturday to
the Pittsburgh Chess Club, which counts several nationally ranked
girls among its membership.
	   ``Even today in some countries, chess isn't something they teach
girls,'' Polgar said. ``It is improving, and once girls start to
play, they've shown they have the talent to compete with men.''
	   Polgar, 29, the reigning world women's champion, started playing
chess before she even started school in Hungary because she was
fascinated with the pieces. Her father taught her the basic moves.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Carmen Miranda a square?
	   Yes.
	   The Brazilian-born 1940s singer-actress with the banana
headdress had her name immortalized in asphalt on Friday. An
intersection across the street from Mann's Chinese Theatre was
officially designated Carmen Miranda Square.
	   The actress, who died in 1955, has her footprints in cement in
front of the theater.
	   Only about a dozen city intersections have been named for
historic personages.
	   ``Carmen was a pioneer,'' Sergio Mielniczenko, a cultural
attache to the Brazilian Consulate, told the Los Angeles Times.
``She was the first name that was widely known from Brazil.''
	   He was among about 70 Brazilian diplomats, performers and fans
who gathered for the dedication.

From Cash to Pay-Czech, country music makes Czechs bounce

	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Forget Madonna, bury the Beastie
Boys. If you take a cab or walk past a bar in this town, chances
are you'll get a dose of that unlikeliest of Czech music sensations
_ country and western.
	   Cowboy hats may be as rare as rodeos here on the Eastern
frontier. But throughout the achy-breaky history of this little
republic, squeezed between Germany and Russia, there has always
been an affinity for music from Nashville.
	   Hum a country favorite by anyone from Hank Williams to Johnny
Cash and locals are likely to chime in with the Czech lyrics.
	   ``I don't see another nation in Europe where country music would
be as popular as here,'' says Honza Sramek, program manager of
Country Radio Prague.
	   Look no further than the station for evidence _ founded in 1991,
it is the most listened-to channel in the Czech capital, with
nearly 300,000 listeners despite the avalanche of imported rock and
pop played elsewhere. From golden oldies to Garth Brooks and Shania
Twain, it plays Czech and American country 24 hours a day.
	   ``People like the sound, the melody and the fact that is not
aggressive,'' Sramek explains.
	   Country music live is just as popular.
	   Bespectacled and balding, an unlikely superstar at 51, Jan
Nedved recently attracted over 70,000 fans to the giant Strahov
stadium _ a feat matched only by the Rolling Stones.
	   His songs of love, romance and betrayal go over the counter in
quantities that make him the nation's best-selling artist.
	   Czechs' passion for country is no short-time fling. Its roots
date to the 1920s and the ``tramp music'' phenomenon, inspired by
both the American dream and the difficulties of the times.
	   Every Saturday, thousands of young people took their guitars and
hit the railroad with one thing in mind: Get away from it all.
	   ``Poor kids wanted to escape the reality of bread lines (during
the Depression) and create an ideal world where justice rules and
nature is beautiful,'' says Mirek Cerny, a country disc jockey in
Prague and member of the Country Music Association in Nashville.
	   Cowboy movies featuring the music of Roy Rogers and Gene Autry
fueled the Wild West mania among Czechs, who saw themselves as
tough individualists, too.
	   Hundreds of makeshift wooden cabins soon dotted the riverbanks
of the Vltava, along with Indian canoes and totems watched over by
a weekend sheriff dressed in home-sewn cowboy clothes.
	   Under Nazi occupation beginning in 1939 and communist control
from 1948, times were hard but the ``tramps'' lived on.
	   ``The tradition continued, regardless of regimes,'' says
promoter Robert Radosta. ``And the music remained pretty much the
same.''
	   In 1964, communist censors allowed two shows in Prague by Pete
Seeger, international apostle of America's folk music. The idea was
that his leftist politics would outweigh the impact of the music.
But the very opposite happened.
	   ``The concerts were recorded and became legends. The sound of
(Seeger's) banjo opened the door to real country music
influences,'' Cerny says.
	   Soon, a local band named the Greenhorns topped the charts with a
Czech version of ``Folsom Prison Blues.''
	   The 1968 Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia was a temporary
setback, driving musicians back to the campfires for new
inspiration. Although far from dissident circles, country music
gatherings were an occasion to get together and speak one's mind.
	   ``It was so simple and naive, but people roared with excitement
every time we would say something bad about the Bolsheviks,''
Nedved says.
	   After communism was overthrown in 1989, country music somehow
endured. Many Czechs who initially embraced the novelty of
international pop eventually tired of the hype and came back to
country.
	   Locally produced music dominates air play on Country Music
Prague. And even the translations of American country hits often
get a uniquely Czech spin.
	   In ``Good-Hearted Woman,'' for example, the ``good-timin'''
villain mentioned by Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson becomes
transformed into a ``good-hearted man'' who does drink French wine
but stays at home with his wife. That altered version became a huge
hit in 1983.
	   ``Czechs like a happy story every now and then,'' Zdenek Rytir,
who wrote the lyrics, explains with a chuckle.

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ First space rocks. Now ants.
	   In the next few weeks, two computer-animated movies about ants
will be released in the United States. DreamWorks' ``Antz,'' led by
the voice of Woody Allen, is out Oct. 2, and the Disney Co.'s ``A
Bug's Life,'' featuring the voice of Dave Foley (``NewsRadio'') as
the lead ant, is to be released nationwide Nov. 25.
	   This would all be only mildly interesting in a year that already
has given us two comet-asteroid movies, except for one thing: the
involvement of Jeffrey Katzenberg, the executive who left Disney
amid much ill-will and co-founded DreamWorks with Steven Spielberg
and David Geffen.
	   Follow the ant trails and it raises questions of whether
Katzenberg knew about Disney's ``A Bug's Life'' when he was
cleaning out his desk as studio chief there, and whether he rushed
out a rival insect movie at DreamWorks to sting his former
employer.
	   In recent weeks, the off-the-record sniping among those involved
in both movies has reached a background roar in Hollywood.
Katzenberg has denied knowing about Disney's movie when he approved
``Antz.'' Executives for the producers of ``A Bug's Life'' declined
to comment. The directors of the two films expressed ignorance
about the competition.
	   ``We concentrated on making our film the best film that we
could,'' said John Lasseter, who directed ``A Bug's Life.''
	   ``We had been working on our film for about a year and a half
when we found out they were starting theirs. We were disappointed,
but we concentrated on making our own film.''
	   Lasseter declined to discuss any other issues linked to the
rival movies, saying: ``I would frankly just like to talk about our
movie.''
	   Eric Darnell, one of the two directors of ``Antz,'' said that
Katzenberg offered suggestions about story and character, but that
the movie never wavered from its 7-year-old premise about a little
critter with big hopes.
	   ``The last thing I wanted to do is make decisions about our film
by making second-guesses about what is in somebody else's film,''
said Darnell.
	   When examining the saga of the dueling ant movies, however, it
hard to ignore the startling coincidences and behind-the-scenes
workings.
	   It begins on Aug. 23, 1994, when Disney issued a press release
announcing the resignation of Katzenberg. Two days later, Lasseter,
of the computer animation house Pixar, pitched the ``Bug's Life''
story to executives other than Katzenberg at Disney. Lasseter was
already working on another film that Disney was excited about _
``Toy Story'' _ and the ant movie was greenlighted on the spot.
	   The idea had other things going for it. Disney also
coincidentally had long been considering doing an animated ant
movie. As far back as 1988, Disney was developing a project that
went by various titles, including ``Army Ants'' and just ``Ants,''
but it had gone nowhere.
	   When Lasseter came to the table, the ant project was
jump-started.
	   Just what Katzenberg knew about the Disney ant movie is a
subject of great debate. He has denied in published reports any
knowledge of the film until after DreamWorks started its own
animated ant movie. But he refused to comment to The Associated
Press about the matter.
	   Still, he was at the Disney studio after his resignation to
finish old business, and saw a rough cut of Lasseter's ``Toy
Story,'' the computer-animated film that would be released in 1995
and become one of the biggest hits in Disney history.
	   By Sept. 30, 1994, Katzenberg was off the Disney lot, leaving
bad feelings and litigation in his wake. He filed a dlrs 250
million breach-of-contract lawsuit, which was settled late last
year.
	   In October 1994, Katzenberg joined forces with Spielberg and
Geffen to form DreamWorks SKG, and the following year the idea for
an animated ant movie was pitched to then-DreamWorks executive Nina
Jacobson (now, ironically, working at Disney) by PDI, a computer
animation house and a rival to Pixar.
	   Like Disney, DreamWorks also had a similar project in the
pipeline, this one a live-action film about insects. The PDI pitch
was based on a 1991 story by Tim Johnson about a little ant caught
in a huge bureaucracy who believes life can offer much more.
	   Jacobson brought the idea to Katzenberg, who approved the
project. By 1996, ``Antz'' was in high gear, with Johnson and
Darnell of PDI directing.
	   ``We did know about 'A Bug's Life,''' said Johnson in an
interview at the Toronto International Film Festival, where
``Antz'' premiered last weekend. ``All we knew is that they had a
film.''

	   He said it wouldn't be unusual for more than one ant project to
be in the works at the same time.
	   ``It's computer animation. It's a new industry. It has
limitations: It doesn't do skin, hair and clothing real well,'' he
said. ``Take away skin, hair and clothing and you have crabs and
insects.''
	   Even though ``A Bug's Life'' got a jump in production on
``Antz,'' it was ``Antz'' that was first to be completed,
unexpectedly early, opening another chapter in the ant saga.
	   ``Antz'' was initially slotted for March 1999, but DreamWorks
pushed it up to October, ensuring that ``Antz'' would be the first
computer-animated bug movie of the fall, beating ``A Bug's Life''
by several weeks.
	   The scheduling of ``Antz'' was also seen by many in Hollywood as
retaliation against Disney for slotting ``A Bug's Life'' for
November against DreamWorks' animated feature, ``The Prince of
Egypt.''
	   DreamWorks changed ``Prince of Egypt'' to Dec. 18. Disney then
moved its ape remake ``Mighty Joe Young'' against ``Prince of
Egypt,'' before pushing ``Mighty Joe Young'' back a week to Dec.
25.
	   How much of these scheduling machinations are due to hurt
feelings or just good business sense _ or a little of both _ is not
clear. Also, the fact that ``Antz'' is coming out first doesn't
necessarily mean it will do any better than ``A Bug's Life,'' as
Disney well knows.
	   The Disney-released ``Armageddon'' came out several weeks after
the other Earth-in-peril picture, ``Deep Impact,'' but ended up
grossing more and went on to become the summer leader _ although
both did very well.
	   In what may by the final twist, both ant films must contend with
yet another animated film, the big-screen adaptation of the popular
Nickelodeon show ``Rugrats,'' which is set for release Nov. 20.
	   Said ``Rugrats'' executive producer Albie Hecht: ``I think we
have the family event movie of 1998.''

What's smaller than Scottish bagpipes? And will it be popular in

America? &QL;

 &UR; AP Newsfeatures Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Since he was 15, Davy Spillane has toured the
world playing the uilleann pipes.
	   Now, at 39, Spillane has arrived on the American music scene
with a CD, ``The Sea of Dreams.'' Sony also plans to issue
Spillane's ``A Place Among the Stones,'' recorded five years ago.
	   For those not familiar with uilleann pipes _ uilleann is the
Irish Gallic word for elbow _ the instrument is smaller than
Scottish bagpipes and held under the elbow.
	   Spillane knows he isn't arriving on the crest of a buying wave
for soulful, melancholy music on the Irish version of the bagpipes.
It's where his mind and creativity are now. He's composing slow
tunes influenced by traditional Irish music and also by Joni
Mitchell, Lowell George of Little Feat, Jaco Pastorius and Steely
Dan.
	   Interest in Irish music has escalated lately in America.
	   ``I'm amazed Irish music hasn't been explored before this,''
Spillane says. ``I think it's due to the Glocca Morra and
leprechaun image of Ireland from Hollywood. For a long time, it
shelved Irish culture as being something you couldn't take
seriously.''
	   ``The Sea of Dreams'' is starkly beautiful, melancholy and
restrained. The songs are slow. Spillane composed six of the 12
tracks. He and Greg Boland co-wrote four. All but two are
instrumental. Sinead O'Connor sings ``The Dream of the Bones,'' for
which she wrote the lyrics, and ``Danny Boy.''
	   Spillane was a founding member of the early '80s folk-rock
group, Moving Hearts.
	   He recalls: ``We were one of the most serious bands ever to come
out of Ireland. U2 used to open for us. We had eight or nine people
and moved our equipment in 40-foot (12-meter) trucks. If I never
had gone with a band again, I would have the respect of being in a
band which cooked at a certain time.''
	   Moving Hearts performed in Northern Ireland as well as the Irish
Republic. The group had some harrowing experiences. They were
stopped at roadblocks and shut up in sheds, not knowing if they'd
be shot. ``I don't want to sensationalize it,'' Spillane says.
	   Spillane recorded dance music with his electronic band in the
late 1980s.
	   ``Pipes fronting an electronic band? It just worked,'' he says.
``Some of the records were getting pretty funky, with big guitar
solos, very rocky by any standards in the world. They were getting
very powerful and strong. That's when I did most of my touring in
Ireland.''
	   Spillane went to a Gallic-speaking elementary school in Dublin
where everyone learned to play the tin whistle. He didn't have a
particular interest in music, but he wasn't interested in
academics. At 13, he could go into a regular curriculum or study
music. He chose music. There was a limited selection of
instruments; he chose the uilleann pipes. ``They were more
substantial than a tin whistle, more of a musical instrument, more
meaty.''
	   He began playing in the streets of Dublin. When he became
financially independent, he quit school and moved to the west of
Ireland, where ``I hooked up in a very big way with Irish gypsy
families. That's where the essence of my style of music in pipes
comes from.''
	   Spillane says Ireland's unbroken line of uilleann pipers
included gypsies and street musicians, as well as those who were
sponsored by the aristocracy and played in drawing rooms.
	   ``For me, the stars of the instrument were gypsies. The players
go into the same emotional area as players of the blues. It may not
sound bluesy, but it's emotional like blues.''

Observations from the Toronto film festival
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MICHAEL FLEEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Entertainment Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ After 10 hectic days of screenings, parties,
business sessions and celebrity sightings, the Toronto
International Film Festival faded to black this past weekend.
	   More than 300 films were screened for hundreds of critics and
movie business executives _ and for film buffs from the general
public who lined up for hours.
	   Here are some final observations:
	   MOST IRONIC FILM TITLE: Critic favorite ``Happiness,'' about a
pedophile, his deluded wife, a perverted apartment dweller, and a
woman with a miserable life (her name is Joy).
	   MOST LITERAL TITLE: ``Very Bad Things,'' about murder, mayhem
and comedy at a party that gets darkly violent. It stars Christian
Slater.
	   MOST MISLEADING TITLE: ``Pecker.'' It refers to the way a
character pecks at his food.
	   CRITIC SPOTTED AT THE FESTIVAL WHO IS MORE FAMOUS THAN NEARLY
EVERYBODY IN EVERY MOVIE: Roger Ebert.
	   VERY BAD PARTY: The Canadian news media, normally
head-over-heels in love with the visiting stars, were fuming over
the party for ``Very Bad Things'' because the security types
refused access to everybody in the movie, including director Peter
Berg and actors Slater and Cameron Diaz, who were cordoned off in
the VIP lounge. ``Catastrophe'' was how one Toronto paper summed it
up.
	   HAVEN'T WE SEEN HER SOMEWHERE?: One of the bartenders at Bistro
990, the most popular hangout for the festival crowd. She's Kathryn
Zenna, an up-and-coming Canadian actress who stars in ``Jack and
Jill'' and appears on the film poster. She was given a few hours
off to attend a festival party, then returned to work.
	   NOW I KNOW WE'VE SEEN HIM BEFORE: Luke Wilson appeared in three
festival films. He stars in ``Home Fries'' and ``Dog Park,'' and
has a small role in ``Rushmore.'' ``That's almost gluttonous on my
behalf,'' he says. ``It's totally a coincidence.''
	   AND THIS MOVIE LOOKS MIGHTY FAMILIAR: The precocious dwarf
movie, ``The Mighty,'' bears many similarities to the recently
released precocious dwarf movie, ``Simon Birch.'' Both have: dwarfs
seeking their destinies; dwarfs who team up with young outcasts for
friends; dwarfs loved by feisty single moms with movie-star looks
(Ashley Judd in ``Birch,'' Sharon Stone in ``Mighty''); dwarfs in
life-threatening hospital scenes; dwarfs in life-threatening snow
scenes; and annoying voice-overs.
	   FULL MONTY AT 70: The funniest scenes in the crowd favorite
``Waking Ned Devine'' call on veteran stars, Ian Bannen, 70, and
David Kelly, 69, to bare all. The pair have about 100 years of
acting experience between them, but had never done nude scenes
before. ``I've never been asked, mind you,'' says Kelly. ``Only
underwear,'' adds Bannen, ``and it was old-fashioned underwear.''
	   SHOCKING SOUNDS: Emma Thompson and Alan Rickman, both British,
speaking in Southern drawls in ``Judas Kiss''; French actress Julie
Delpy speaking with a ditsy California-girl accent in ``L.A.
Without a Map''; and gravel-voiced Texan Kris Kristofferson
speaking French in ``A Soldier's Daughter Never Cries.''
	   FUNNIEST WOODY ALLEN MOVIE IN YEARS: ``Antz,'' in which he
provides the voice for a computer animated bug with big dreams. He
tells his ant analyst in the teeming mega-colony: ``I always feel
uncomfortable with crowds.''

	   In the spotlight: Janeane Garofalo, pint-sized cynic
	    &UR; Image: Janeane Garofalo stands tall at 5 feet 1 inch (1.55
meters). Born on Sept. 28, 1964, she favors cutoffs, a huge black
plastic watch, enormous shoes, chopped hair of indeterminate color,
silver rings and little blue tattoos.
	    &UR; Pronunciation guide: JuhNEEN GuhROFFuhLO, not Jane Ann
GARoFALo.
	    &UR; Personal info: As a kid growing up in New Jersey, Garofalo says
her seventh-grade fantasy was to marry someone funny _ like Albert
Brooks. A history and American studies major at Providence (Rhode
Island) College, Garofalo started toying with stand-up comedy
during her senior year. She was voted ``the funniest person in
Rhode Island'' in a contest sponsored by Showtime.
	   Was she funny? ``I doubt it,'' she says. ``Rhode Island is not
known for its funny people.''
	   Shortly thereafter, Garofalo started working full-time as a
comedian and appearing on television. She met actor-director Ben
Stiller and appeared in his short-lived TV show in 1992. Later that
same year, Garofalo joined ``The Larry Sanders Show'' as Paula, the
acerbic talent booker. She appeared on NBC's ``Saturday Night
Live'' in 1994. (``It was less than one season,'' Garofalo says.
``But it felt like 20 years.'')
	    &UR; Movie roles: Her credits include ``Reality Bites,'' ``The Truth
About Cats and Dogs,'' ``Romy and Michele's High School Reunion,''
``Matchmaker'' and ``The Cable Guy.''
	   After ``The Truth About Cats and Dogs,'' Garofalo says, ``I
realized I was getting the same scripts and not getting parts where
I had really good auditions. ... I just knew it was a weight issue
and a looks issue that I wasn't getting the parts.
	   ``So I tried as an experiment to lose some weight and see what
happens. It's remarkable the difference in the feedback you get
after an audition weighing 140 (63.5 kilos) and weighing 105 (48
kilos). Oddly enough, you do get more talented as you get
thinner.''
	    &UR; Up next: She stars in ``Clay Pigeons'' with Joaquin Phoenix and
Vince Vaughn; ``Permanent Midnight'' with Stiller and Elizabeth
Hurley; ``Thick as Thieves'' with Alec Baldwin and Andre Braugher;
``Dog Park'' with Natasha Henstridge; and ``200 Cigarettes'' with
Ben Affleck and Courtney Love.

	   RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) _ A Brazilian is suing a city for dlrs
310,000 (500,000 reals), claiming a municipal clinic got his HIV
test wrong and left him thinking for four years he would die of
AIDS.
	   Nadilson Martins, 40, a married father of two, said by telephone
from Angra dos Reis, a coastal city about 90 miles (150 kms)
southwest of Rio, that the test ``destroyed his life''.
	   He quit his job in 1994 as a city councillor's aide, sold his
house and returned to his birthplace in northeastern Brazil to live
out what he thought were his final days, he said.
	   It was only late last year that a doctor persuaded Martins to
take a second test and found there was nothing wrong with him, he
said.
	   Officials of Angra dos Reis, the city being sued, admitted
Martins had an HIV test at one of its clinics in 1994, said the O
Globo newspaper. No one was available for comment Saturday.
	   ___
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A band of gunmen opened fire on two police
officers in a patrol car killing them instantly, authorities said
Saturday.
	   The officers, who had been patrolling outside a subway station
in a southeast neighborhood of this city to prevent muggings, died
instantly late Friday, said a police report.
	   The victims were identified as Jose Luis Lopez Minor and
Anastasio Placido Ramirez, both members of a special city judicial
police unit trained to fight crime on the streets.
	   Witnesses said the gunmen opened fire on the patrol car and
fled. Two escaped on a motorcycle and several more in a white
automobile, the report said.
	   There were no immediate clues as to why the two officers were
killed.
	   ___
	   PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) _ Agents seized 150 kilograms of
cocaine being smuggled to the United States and arrested 10 men, a
law enforcement officer said Saturday.
	   Ronaldo Reyna, head of a judicial police anti-drug unit, told
reporters the drug was concealed in a container filled with medical
equipment at the Atlantic port of Coco Solo.
	   Reyna said the shipment came from Colombia and was bound for the
United States when special agents from Panama, the U.S. and
Colombia intercepted it late Friday.
	   Six of the men arrested were Colombian citizens and four were
Panamanian, Reyna said.

Slovak opposition claims victory based on early election numbers

	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Opposition parties proclaimed
victory in Slovak elections even before the first official results
were released, calling a defeat of Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar's
hard-line government inevitable.
	   The four leading opposition groups scheduled talks Sunday to try
to form a governing majority. They celebrated with champagne late
Saturday, jubilant at exit poll numbers and unofficial results that
may signal the end of the authoritarian rule that has dominated
Slovakia throughout its nearly six years of independence.
	   But the political demise of Meciar, whose anti-democratic
practices have left Slovakia diplomatically isolated in Central
Europe, remained far from certain.
	   ``We are going to win in spite of all the polls,'' declared
Sergej Kozlik, vice chairman of Meciar's Movement for a Democratic
Slovakia.
	   International human rights groups and the opposition had warned
for weeks that Meciar might meddle with the election or the vote
count in order to ensure a continuation in power.
	   Officials of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, which had more than 200 monitors in Slovakia for the
elections, said the voting process from parliamentary elections
Friday and Saturday appeared to have gone well.
	   The key, foreign officials said, will be in the official results
and how they are implemented.
	   Two nationwide exit polls and an unofficial sampling of the vote
count showed the top four opposition parties within apparent easy
reach of a governing majority if they combine forces as promised.
	   Based on one of the exit polls, they may even win a combined
three-fifths of the 150-seat Parliament _ the majority needed to
elect Slovakia's president.
	   But Meciar's ruling HZDS was in a virtual dead heat for first
place among the 17 competing parties, trailing the opposition
Slovak Democratic Coalition 26 percent to 25 percent, based on
unofficial numbers given by election officials at a selected 300 of
5,000 precincts nationwide. The samples were reported by the
respected MVK independent polling agency and sponsored by
pro-opposition TV Markiza.
	   If it is the top vote-getting party, the HZDS would likely be
given first chance to put together another governing coalition.
Even though its prospects for finding allies are bleak because of
strong anti-Meciar sentiments, political jockeying and posturing
began as soon as the voting ended.
	   Opposition leaders said without exception that they were assured
a joint majority in Parliament.
	   ``This is a vote for new hope and for a new beginning for
Slovakia,'' said coalition leader Mikulas Dzurinda, who stands to
be prime minister if the opposition alliance takes power.
	   But ruling party official Milan Topoli insisted the HZDS could
still put together a majority coalition with the help of the Party
of the Democratic Left, former Communists.
	   The vice chairwoman of that party, Brigita Schmognerova,
dismissed such a notion and said the ruling party leaders ``only
want to give us a bad name by saying we will cooperate with them.''
	   She stopped short of guaranteeing they would join the opposition
alliance, saying the other parties must ``accept our
requirements.''

	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Facts and figures on Slovakia, which
held national elections Friday and Saturday:
	   ___
	   LAND: A Central European nation bounded by Austria, Czech
Republic, Hungary, Poland and Ukraine. Rugged mountains in the
central and northern parts, lowlands in the south. Size is 48,845
square kilometers _ about twice the size of Belgium _ from the
Danube plain in the west to the High Tatra Mountains in the east.
	   ___
	   PEOPLE: About 5.5 million people. 86 percent Slovak, more than
10 percent Hungarian. Sixty percent are Roman Catholics.
	   ___
	   HISTORY: Annexed by Hungary in 1018 and remained so for the next
900 years; part of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy from 1867 until
its defeat in World War I. United with neighbors to form
Czechoslovakia in 1918. Was a Nazi ally in World War II despite
strong resistance by Slovak partisans. Communist-ruled from 1948
until 1989; broke with the Czechs to become independent Slovakia on
Jan. 1, 1993.
	   ___
	   INDUSTRY: Metallurgy, agriculture, chemicals and manmade fibers,
machinery, forest products.
	   ___
	   ECONOMY: The economy has been relatively stable in the difficult
transition from communism to a free-market economy, but foreign
experts say the ruling party has kept it artificially stable in the
runup to elections and that it is due for a blowup. Unemployment
about 14 percent, inflation 6 percent to 8 percent. Foreign
investors steering clear of Slovakia because of ruling party's
strict controls on privatization process.
	   ___
	   POLITICS: The 150-seat Parliament chooses the prime minister and
president. Prime Minister Vladimir Meciar, elected in 1992, lost
the post in a no-confidence vote in March 1994 due to a floundering
economy and criticism over his harsh rule, but regained it six
months later when his nationalist Movement for a Democratic
Slovakia won elections. Widely assailed for autocratic style and
for clamping down on the media and opposition; also has assumed
most presidential powers due to the failure of the Parliament he
controls to elect a president. A leery NATO and European Union have
bypassed Slovakia for potential membership.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ After one of the tightest races in postwar
Germany, voters Sunday choose a chancellor to shepherd Europe's
largest nation through historic changes: the government's move back
to Berlin, and the switch from the trusted German mark to the euro,
Europe's common currency.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, 68, who merged communist East Germany
with the West in 1990, is seeking an unprecedented fifth term after
16 years in office. His appeal is stability and his clout with
world powers at a time of economic turmoil in Russia and ongoing
conflict in the Balkans.
	   His challenger, Gerhard Schroeder, 54, has campaigned as the
voice of change, appealing to Germans who feel the nation has
stagnated under Kohl, the West's longest-serving leader.
	   Besides tackling grand projects as Germany moves into the 21st
century _ NATO and European Union expansion, as well as the
government move and the common currency _ the new chancellor has
serious domestic problems to address during his four-year term.
	   Unemployment, running above 10 percent, was the main campaign
issue this year, and the candidates offered only cautious proposals
for modernizing Germany's prosperous but over-regulated economy.
	   Both Kohl and Schroeder said they wanted to reduce regulations
sapping the German competitiveness. But Kohl has proposed a bigger
tax cut than Schroeder.
	   Schroeder, a populist who has tried to move his traditionally
leftist party toward the center, promised few specifics in an
effort to appeal to the widest possible audience. Where he offered
details, his plans called for repealing modest cuts in social
welfare and retirement programs that Kohl pushed through in the
last four years.
	   Up to 21 percent of Germany's 60.5 million voters remained
undecided on the eve of the election, according to polls Saturday.
Voters choose a new 656-seat parliament, where the party with the
most seats proposes the chancellor. If no party wins a majority, as
is likely this year, the strongest party forms a coalition.
	   Kohl narrowed the Social Democrats' considerable 12-percent lead
in the polls to within a few points in the weeks before the vote.
Pollsters said the election was too close to predict, and that it
seemed most likely that Kohl's Christian Democrats and Schroeder's
Social Democrats would have to share power in a so-called ``grand
coalition.'' Germany has not seen the two main parties govern
together in almost 30 years.
	   The survival of Kohl's center-right government depended not only
on his popularity but also on the tiny pro-business Free Democrats,
his junior coalition partner. Polls suggested they might not make
it into parliament this time.
	   If Schroeder wins enough votes to form a coalition on his own,
his likely partner would be the environmentalist Greens party.
	   The Greens had their best shot yet at entering government. Their
biggest threat were swing voters in the former communist east who
many predicted would opt for the ex-communist Party for Democratic
Socialism as a protest vote against Bonn politics.

	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ More South African soldiers backed by
troops from Botswana have positioned themselves in Lesotho to help
disarm mutineers and restore calm to the African kingdom.
	   About 1,000 Lesotho soldiers streamed into their headquarters
Saturday raising hopes that clashes between the two sides were
ending. South African troops fanned out across the country to halt
looting that began hours after they crossed the border Tuesday to
quell a mutiny in Lesotho's army and end a series of crippling
strikes.
	   The soldiers who came to army headquarters represented half of
Lesotho's armed forces. South African Col. Jorrie Jordaan told them
to return to duty Monday and to turn in their weapons then, and to
tell the other soldiers to do the same.
	   Intervention force troops would look for any soldiers who don't
appear for duty Monday, and search for any missing weapons, Jordaan
said.
	   South Africa's first peacekeeping mission since apartheid
exploded when the force arrived without advance warning. Believing
they were being invaded, both loyalist and mutinous Lesotho
soldiers turned their guns on the South Africans.
	   Many of the 1,000 Lesotho troops who heeded an order to gather
at their headquarters expressed pride in their actions during South
Africa's intervention, in which some 80 people, including at least
eight South African soldiers, were killed.
	   One Lesotho soldier eyed the South Africans guarding his
comrades-in-arms from cannon-mounted armored vehicles.
	   ``Look at them, they are so proud _ the girl-guys inside these
things of theirs,'' the soldier said, scorning the South Africans'
manhood. ``Some of them met our brothers in heaven.''
	   ``They have armored cars and helicopters, but they're not good
soldiers,'' another scoffed.
	   South African troops frisked the returning soldiers, most
dressed in civilian clothes, for weapons and treated them warily _
as neither rebels nor comrades nor prisoners of war.
	   ``I feel more like a prisoner because when I arrived here, I had
to fill out a prisoner-of-war form saying what unit I belonged
to,'' said Pvt. Harari Maziboko.
	   Lesotho Brigadier Anthony Thibeli told his troops to ``stow away
your dignity and work in peace.''
	   South Africa beefed up its initial deployment of 600 soldiers by
sending in 450 more soldiers on Saturday, joint task force
commander Col. Robbie Hartslief told the Sunday Times, a
Johannesburg newspaper. Botswana sent in 200 soldiers on Wednesday.
	   The capital and its outskirts were calm Saturday for the second
straight day.
	   But the political stalemate continued, with Prime Minister
Pakalitha Mosisili _ who requested the intervention _ refusing to
negotiate with opponents who claim May's elections were rigged.
	   The capital, meanwhile, lay in ruins. Looters and arsonists
initially targeted businesses belonging to members of Mosisili's
party but it became indiscriminate, with at least 80 percent of
Maseru's shops in ashes.

Five Questions with Ann Warren: she puts the icing on the cake
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY302 &QL; 
 &UR; By KATHLEEN SAMPEY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ In the spring of 1988, Ann and Michael Warren
opened the Cupcake Cafe in Manhattan's Hell's Kitchen.
	   ``Overnight _ one of those long nights that takes about two
years _ Ann went from decorating cakes with portraits of dearly
departed German shepherds to decorating birthday cakes for Madonna
and Mick Jagger,'' says her sister, Joan Lilly, co-author of their
new book, ``The Cupcake Cafe Cookbook'' (Doubleday).
	   The Warrens opened the bakery, which is located on a corner of
39th Street where Ninth Avenue slouches toward the Lincoln Tunnel,
to sell homemade doughnuts. (One section of the cookbook explains
``Why Doughnuts Aren't Really So Bad for You.'')
	   But it's the decorated cakes that attract customers _
celebrities and average citizens alike _ despite the shop's
Depression-era decor of linoleum and Formica, with music to match.
	   Jagger, Barbra Streisand, Donna Karan and many fashion-industry
types have placed orders. Ms. Warren's flowery birthday cake for
Madonna about five years ago was such eye candy, the singer
reportedly threw herself into it.
	   Did Madonna really dive into the cake?
	   ``That's what I'm told. The party was on some boat. I'm sure
people got to eat it. I don't think she thought she was ruining it,
she probably thought she was enhancing it,'' Ms. Warren says with a
laugh.
	   Ms. Warren and her staff of decorators create flower decorations
so delicate and colorfully vibrant, they would have sent artist
Georgia O'Keeffe scurrying for a pastry bag. They can artfully
arrange a bouquet of buttercream zinnias on a thick dark chocolate
frosting or a field of buttercream sunflowers on vanilla frosting.
	   ``People ask you to put ridiculously complex themes on cakes and
cupcakes,'' Ms. Warren, 43, says, shaking her head. (No, she cannot
put the Sistine Chapel on a cupcake.)
	   Some requests _ for big hairy backsides and such _ are rejected.
	   ``If it amuses us, and it depends on how the order is presented,
we might do it,'' she explains. ``If we think it's a joke that will
indeed be funny to the person that's going to get the cake, it's no
problem.''
	   For those wanting a taste of the Cupcake Cafe at home, ``The
Cupcake Cafe Cookbook'' promises that anyone can make the
doughnuts, scones, muffins and other treats sold in the shop. It
also gives decorating instructions.
	   1. Can you tell us what famous people have come into the Cupcake
Cafe?
	   Warren: I've sat here gossiping with friends, and famous people
have come in and gone out and you don't even know it. For years,
Tatum O'Neal would sit in here. The woman who played Wonder Woman,
Lynda Carter. The 'Miami Vice' guy, Don Johnson. I've had people
sit here in what seems to be conversations with each other, until
you realize that, of course, they're reading lines or rehearsing a
script. Even though New Yorkers will talk about anything anywhere,
STILL!
	   2. How do you know when cake orders are for famous people?
	   Warren: A lot of those people who are really 'big' have cooks
and they order from us. Sometimes people tell you because they
really want you to know. They think that you're going to do a
better job. But actually you'd do the same job for someone who's
not famous.
	   3. What kind of cake did you make for Madonna's birthday?
	   Warren: It was about five years ago, and Madonna wanted a white
chocolate buttercream icing on her birthday cake. It made me ill
for weeks. Of course, you've got to taste the thing because you're
making something you don't make every day. So you have to keep
tasting it to make sure it's all right. It really made us ill by
the time we got it all ready. I never wanted to see white chocolate
again.
	   4. Besides the decorations, what makes your cakes different from
all others?
	   Warren: Buttercream, which is common but there aren't many other
places that make a real buttercream. This is a cooked sugar syrup.
It's not made with confectioners' sugar. We use real whole eggs,
sweet butter. It doesn't have fillers aside from vanilla or
chocolate. It doesn't taste like lard ... or uncooked sugar or any
of those other ingredients found in other recipes.
	   5. Can someone with no baking skills whatsoever successfully
create the goodies in ``The Cupcake Cafe Cookbook''?
	   Warren: Absolutely. The cake recipes are not difficult. There's
no finesse. Nothing has to rise especially. The doughnuts are
tricky. I thought it would be fun to share the
making-doughnuts-at-home experience. It's the one thing that people
are daunted to try, which they really shouldn't be. They're tricky
but they're a lot of fun and they taste really, really good.

At the Movies: 'Shadrach'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: film opened Wednesday &QL; 
 &UR; By BOB THOMAS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ What is there about the backwaters of Dixie that
pumps the creative juices of writers and filmmakers? From ``Tobacco
Road'' to ``Forrest Gump,'' from ``Baby Doll'' to ``Ulee's Gold,''
scarcely a Southern county has been overlooked.
	   ``Shadrach'' continues this long tradition. Based on a short
story by William Styron, it has been lovingly translated to the
screen by his daughter, Susanna Styron, who served as director and
co-writer with Bridget Terry. Hardly more than a vignette, the film
is flawlessly acted by a pair of professionals, Harvey Keitel and
Andie MacDowell, and two newcomers, an old man and a young boy.
	   Paul Whitehurst (Scott Terra), 10, is the only child of
well-mannered, middle-class parents in a Virginia hamlet during the
Depression. A dutiful, churchgoing son, Paul is nevertheless
attracted to the Dabneys, a large, impoverished and ill-mannered
family whose ancestors owned a plantation.
	   Vernon Dabney (Keitel) presides over the family. A blustery,
bigoted, profane man, his skills are limited to producing moonshine
in a wooded hideaway. His wife Trixie (MacDowell) directs the
children's activities, beer bottle in hand.
	   The Whitehurst parents must leave for Baltimore because of a
death in the family. Against their better judgment, they accede to
their son's pleas to be allowed to stay with the Dabneys. Paul
immediately abandons his well-scrubbed life as he joins his earthy
neighbors.
	   Along comes Shadrach. He is a former slave nearing the end of
his 99 years. He has walked all the way from Alabama to Virginia so
he can be buried among his family on the old Dabney plantation.
	   At first Vernon rejects the idea of caring for the old man. But
he is overruled by his wife and children. As Shadrach's death seems
near, Vernon begins to prepare for the burial. But the sheriff
admonishes him that burial on private ground is forbidden in
Virginia. Vernon faces the choice of paying for a professional
burial or flaunting the law, as he does with his still.
	   A graduate of the American Film Institute, Susanna Styron
evidences tendencies of former film students: shooting through
foliage, use of slow motion, etc. But she shows real talent in
dealing with characters; all of the actors in ``Shadrach'' seem
real and rooted in the Depression-stricken 1930s.
	   Keitel is expert in domineering roles, and he shines as the
rough but fair-minded paterfamilias. The usually elegant Andie
MacDowell seems to enjoy playing the slovenly wife and mother.
	   John Franklin Sawyer brings a commanding presence to the role of
the old ex-slave; it would have been fascinating to learn more
about his life, not just his death. Terra is another of those
amazing actors whose fresh face reflects all the wonder of youth.
	   Martin Sheen provides a useful narration as the grownup Paul.
	   The Columbia Pictures release was produced by Bridget Terry,
with two other producers and six executive producers also listed.
Running time: 88 minutes.

Hetherington leads after third round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUTZTOWN, Pennsylvania (AP) _ Rachel Hetherington, who was atop
a leaderboard for the first time in her LPGA career after the
second round, had a 2-under-par 70 Saturday to maintain her
one-stroke lead another round of the First Union Betsy King
Classic.
	   Beth Daniel, who started the third round one stroke behind
Hetherington, kept pace with a 70 and her 10-under 206 total was
two strokes ahead of defending champion Annika Sorenstam, Laura
Davies, Se Ri Pak and Juli Inkster.
	   Hetherington, a 36-year-old native of Australia who is in her
second year on the U.S. tour, said she didn't want to look at the
leaderboards, but still sensed she was leading the way.
	   ``You could just sort of tell,'' said Hetherington, who had an
11-under 205 after three rounds at the Berkleigh Country Club. ``I
just tried to be steady as I felt there were a lot of people in the
hunt.''
	   She admitted she didn't play as well as she did Friday when she
had a 66 and that was because she was a bit nervous.
	   ``Leading coming into today helped me a lot,'' said
Hetherington, who events in Germany and Spain in 1995. ``I was able
to relax more. But I made the shots when I had to.''
	   Daniel was a co-leader after an opening-round 67.
	   ``Winning this would mean a lot to me because it has Betsy's
(King) name on it,'' said Daniel, who has won 33 LPGA tournaments.
``I just can't get ahead of myself tomorrow.''
	   The impressive group tied for third at 208 have a collective 51
wins, including 10 majors.
	   Davies had a 68 but missed an opportunity to take the lead when
she three-putted on both 11 and 18. She is winless on the tour this
season, and her last victory was the Standard Register Ping Classic
in March 1997.
	   ``I should be happy, but I'm really ticked off,'' Davies said.
``It's just a lot of missed putts and it's frustrating.''
	   Inkster had a third-round 70, Pak a 69 and Sorenstam closed a 68
with an eagle on the par-5 18th.
	   ``It was a nice way to end the day,'' Sorenstam said. ``Today
wasn't really pretty. Coming down the stretch tomorrow will be
important.''
	   Hiromi Kobayashi and Lorie Kane had 68s to lead a group of four
at 209 that included Charlotta Sorenstam and Karrie Webb, who had
70s.

Carl Franklin _ From `One False Move' to `One True Thing'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY300 &QL; 
 &UR; By DOUGLAS J. ROWE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Carl Franklin lived a lot of life before
deciding he wanted to direct.
	   Married and divorced twice, a single father, and a journeyman
actor for years, he enrolled in the American Film Institute's
master's program in 1986, at age 37, to learn how to work behind
the camera.
	   ``I felt that by that time I had stories to tell, that there was
a reason for me to do it,'' says Franklin, who first got serious
notice with his 1992 film, ``One False Move.'' Franklin didn't have
any real directing experience but he took to it very easily.
	   School began a month after his mother's death in August 1986,
and his experiences during her eight-month battle with cancer 12
years ago were a key reason Franklin warmed to the prospect of
making ``One True Thing.''
	   The film, No. 2 at the box office in its debut weekend, is about
a daughter who relinquishes her job as a magazine writer in New
York to move home and care for her terminally ill mother.
	   When his longtime collaborator, producer Jesse Beaton, brought
him a screenplay adapted from the Anna Quindlen novel, he found it
a deeply penetrating story.
	   Like the young woman in the story _ played by Renee Zellweger _
he underestimated his mother because she was a housewife without a
higher education.
	   ``I'd always been very condescending in some respects and taken
her for granted, and her knowledge for granted, and never really
valued it as I came to value it later _ when unfortunately she
wasn't around anymore,'' says Franklin, who attended the University
of California at Berkeley as an undergraduate.
	   Unlike the Zellweger character, Franklin didn't return home to
care for his mom. His brothers were around for their mother in the
San Francisco Bay Area, and Franklin _ who was raising his kids and
preparing for classes in Los Angeles _ frequently visited.
	   ``That doesn't totally assuage any guilt you might feel about
not having participated enough,'' he says, although he was with his
mother when she died.
	   ``There's still some unsettled things for me because I wasn't
there all the time like my brothers were. ... I was pretty spoiled
in a lot of ways.''
	   And now Franklin _ who has a 32-year-old stepdaughter,
22-year-old son and 21-year-old daughter _ is seeing the
transactions between parent and adult children from the other end.
	   Franklin emerged as a skillful director only six years ago, with
the independent film ``One False Move.'' Made on a shoestring
budget of dlrs 2.2 million and starring Billy Bob Thornton, Cynda
Williams and Bill Paxton, it made numerous critics' annual top 10
lists. He followed with ``Devil in a Blue Dress,'' adapted from a
Walter Mosley novel and starring Denzel Washington, receiving
further critical praise.
	   In his films, he has neatly interwoven racial, regional and
class differences _ and now gender and generational ones. Franklin
feels that of the movies he's done so far, ``the style has been
best served by making them fairly realistic.''
	   ``What people have always responded to in Carl's work is not the
edginess but the humanity,'' Beaton, his partner, says. ``Carl has
a real sensitivity to the emotional lives of people.''
	   Franklin's move from actor to director took at least 13 years.
	   Fans of TV's ``The A-Team'' may best remember his acting days,
when he played a recurring nemesis named Capt. Crane in 1984. He
popped up in various TV series from the mid-1970s into the late
'80s, including ``Streets of San Francisco,'' ``Cannon,'' ``Barnaby
Jones,'' ``Lou Grant,'' MacGyver,'' even ``Alf.'' And he was a
regular on three short-lived series.
	   He directed three forgettable B-films for Roger Corman in 1989
and 1990, including an action movie made in the Philippines that
co-starred a guy whose current claim to fame is owning a bar in a
New York City subway station.
	   Finally, with ``One False Move,'' Franklin won widespread,
positive notices.
	   The film, about three cocaine dealers who flee to a tiny town in
Arkansas, received little promotion. But critical drooling and
word-of-mouth made the movie a success.
	   Because the film wasn't ``ethnicity-specific'' _ to use
Franklin's term _ people wrongly assumed he was white. Most black
directors can be ``ghettoized'' in the movie industry and reduced
to making only boyz-in-the-hood or so-called ``black'' projects,
but Franklin was offered a wide range of material and was not
pigeonholed based on skin color.
	   Still, he says, ``My experiences are a little atypical.''
	   And that's why he's loath to characterize as a breakthrough the
fact that several black directors this year have managed to make
films without being relegated to stereotypical material _ Forrest
Whitaker (``Hope Floats''); Anton Fuqua (``The Replacement
Killers''); F. Gary Gray (``The Negotiator'') and himself.
	   ``I know a lot of black directors would not agree with that,''
he says. ``And so I'm a little hesitant to talk in generalities
simply because there are other voices saying other things.''
	   Although it's significant that four or five black directors in
one were allowed to do a broad range of movies, Franklin says he's
cautious when he talks about trends.
	   Then he laughs and says: ``I don't even want to talk about a
trend to the extent that I'm going to make another movie.''

Visionaries on the fringe: outsider art, inner visions

 &UR; With ARTS-Outsider Art-Whitfield &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos NY316-317 &QL; 
 &UR; By SARA SILVER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ A deaf man spends 20 years alone in a dingy
Manhattan hotel room cutting postage stamps into tiny rectangles,
blending golds and turquoises into mosaic dreams.
	   A homeless man bleaches outlines of fantastic beasts into black
cloth using a syringe from a clean-needle program.
	   A new divorcee celebrates by sewing a quilt that reads: ``Free
at Last!''
	   This is ``outsider art.'' And if art is about expressing
yourself, these artists are screaming.
	   They are people who learn their craft outside art schools, who
work outside high art and folk traditions, and who rarely exhibit
their art outside the home. Many live on society's margins _ as
mental patients, recluses, prisoners or self-declared prophets.
	   ``For outsider artists, the urge to create is so great it's
overwhelming. It's not a question of why. It's a necessity,'' says
John Maizels, editor of the British magazine Raw Vision. ``The
making of art is a natural human urge, and as with all urges it
varies greatly among people.''
	   Outsider artists, also known as visionary artists, have vivid
inner lives _ sometimes hearing voices, having religious
revelations or apocalyptic visions. Their creativity helps them
overcome what is often a personal history of trauma and tragedy.
	   After J. Benfield lost his wife to a drunk driver, the Amarillo,
Texas, man began encrusting a 1963 Corvair with his beloved's
pearls. He then added jewelry from other women who fell victim to
the fatal mix of alcohol and gasoline.
	   The pearlescent memorial transcends kitsch. The front of the car
is extended, like the back of a hearse. Dolls rest in peace on the
dashboard. Red, white and blue beads on each door transform the
vehicle itself into a flag-draped coffin. Musical notes dot the
bumpers, symbolically muting the fatal crash.
	   This monument to lost love, and works of passion by 71 other
artists, are on display until summer 1999 at the American Visionary
Art Museum in an exhibit called ``Love: Error and Eros.''
	   The ultra-hip museum, looking over Baltimore's Inner Harbor, is
America's only institution dedicated to visionary art. It features
a cabinet made of 1 million matchsticks and food coloring,
paintings by a Swiss woman who fantasized about being with Kaiser
Wilhelm II, a hot air balloon to carry the words of Jesus and
Sandra Doggett's divorce quilt, whose squares turn anger and hurt
into warm comfort for lonely nights.
	   The museum, whose gift shop sells build-your-own shrine kits,
doesn't get too hung up on defining visionary art.
	   ``Like love, you know it when you see it,'' says founder and
director Rebecca Hoffberger. Or as author Jonathan Swift once said:
``Vision is the art of seeing things invisible.''
	   French sculptor Jean Dubuffet was among the first to collect _
and preserve _ the work of schizophrenics and peasants after World
War II. He called it ``Art Brut,'' or ``Raw Art,'' since it was
uncooked by high culture, which he thought hindered creativity.
	   His collection is preserved in the Collection de l'Art Brut in
Lausanne, Switzerland, where pieces hang starkly on black walls.
	   Much visionary art, however, remains hidden.
	   Stamp artist Paul Edlin spent much of the last two decades alone
in a dusty hotel room on Manhattan's Upper West Side, meticulously
cutting up stamps, using a straight pin to lift each speck into
place in a shimmering mosaic like those of the Byzantine era.
	   Edlin, who was born with a 90 percent hearing loss, was thought
to be retarded until he was 6. He kept his work a secret from his
family, who discouraged him from studying painting. The 67-year-old
artist first displayed his collages in 1995 and a nephew has since
been able to have his work shown in three exhibitions, including a
solo show this year in New York.
	   ``Stamps are interesting because the designs are interesting,''
says Edlin, who spends three months on a single collage. ``But when
you cut it up it becomes another design _ it becomes something
abstract.''
	   In ``Right Dream,'' animals and people float through a sleeping
man's mind in a palette of yellow ochre taken from U.N. stamps,
royal burgundy from British portraits of Queen Elizabeth and
speckled browns from a feeding doe on an American postcard stamp.
	   ``Compared to conceptual art, which is often art about art,
people are just blown away by this work, that it even exists _ that
someone makes a collage of stamp bits or a painting from dots of
ink or embroiders a picture with 1,200 stitches per square inch,''
says Aarne Anton, director of the American Primitive Gallery, which
sponsored Edlin's show.
	   Anton also represents Anthony Dominguez, who bleaches the
outlines of griffins and butterfly-head skeletons into black cloth.
Dominguez sleeps in abandoned New York buildings, subsisting on
discarded food and books about the ascetic lives of early Christian
saints.
	   Dominguez, who has traveled through Greece, Spain, and India on
earnings from the sale of his work, does not consider himself
homeless. He considers himself free.
	   ``I haven't a care,'' he says, ``for I'm absolutely dead.''
	   The market for outsider art has grown enormously in the last
decade. It is now sold at craft fairs, in dozens of specialized
galleries and by dealers across North America and Europe.

	   But the market remains erratic. Some artists, for whatever
reason, price each piece in the millions and sell nothing.
Collectors tell horror stories of simple artists who sell an entire
life's work for a pittance to dealers roaming the back roads of the
American South, where such art abounds.
	   The wider interest in outsider art ``seems to stem from a deeply
felt need for experience that feels honest, authentic and highly
personal, a need that not only goes deeper than the marketplace,
but in fact may be at odds with it,'' writes folklorist Roger
Manley in the book ``Self-Made Worlds.''
	   The book, published by Aperture, is a photographic tour of the
trailers, backyards, abbeys and mausoleums that visionary artists
transformed into otherworldly environments.
	   Featured among the pages are the Watts Towers, the 10-story
ladders of metal, seashell and ginger-ale bottles that rise above
the impoverished section of Los Angeles, and the famous Le Palais
Ideal (The Ideal Palace) in Hauterives, France, created in the late
1800s by a postman who cemented stones into entire landscapes
replete with feeding animals.
	   Celebrating such bizarre creations as art has a dual function,
according to the Baltimore museum.
	   For its first exhibit, the museum passed a resolution to
celebrate the creativity of ``the sort of people the world tends to
overlook: the poor, the homeless, the recluses, the misfits, the
old. For if the world could see the wild beauty of their visions,
perhaps it would come to see them, too, in a different way.''

Artist paints imagined history of slavery
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With ARTS-US-Outsider Art &QL; 
 &UR; By SARA SILVER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ It took Mary Whitfield two years to paint a dead
tree, and two more years to find the courage to hang a dead man
from it. Since then she hasn't stopped.
	   Scenes of lynching dominate the dense watercolors of Whitfield,
a self-taught artist who is haunted by suffering _ both historic
and contemporary _ of blacks in the United States. She bases her
work on stories passed down by her grandmother, which range from
poignant tales of pastoral life to vivid accounts of slavery.
	   ``I can have paintings of lynchings all over my wall. It doesn't
frighten me. It just tells me that my ancestors' story needs to be
told in truth,'' says Whitfield, 51. ``If it weren't for their
suffering, I wouldn't be here, would I?''
	   Whitfield makes watercolor look like oil paint, brushing the
canvas over and over to achieve rich, evocative browns for the
leafless trees and dusky blues and oranges for screaming skies.
White acrylic gives form to the flowing dresses and puffy head
scarves of mourners.
	   Her characters have thin, featureless faces, and it is their
dramatic gestures or inclined heads that draw the mostly flat
figures _ and the eye of the viewer _ across the canvas.
	   Even in her tender scenes of children jumping rope, fields of
sunflowers, or mothers nestling babies, there is still a feeling of
sadness.
	   ``I tried to paint people happy, and I can't see how they can be
happy,'' says the artist, who believes that economic injustice has
replaced slavery as the main source of oppression for American
blacks.
	   ``The world is too cruel to black men, and if I knew that I
wouldn't have had any children,'' says Whitfield, who has three
sons.
	   Born in 1947, Whitfield spent her early years with her
grandmother, who took her to civil-rights meetings and to church.
She moved to the Long Island suburbs of New York City with her
mother, and later married a hardware salesman. She supervised
library services for a Long Island company, and started painting
with old house paint and plywood when her children were young.
	   In 1990, when her children were grown, Whitfield bought
watercolors and canvas board, fueling an almost religious drive to
give form to the imagined life of her forebears.
	   Whitfield, whose works have sold for up to dlrs 5,000, has been
commissioned to do a children's book about her husband's life
growing up with his eight brothers and sisters on a North Carolina
farm.
	   ``She gives an emotionally powerful account of the quiet, steady
bonding of a family going through daily life, which children can
identify with,'' says Laura Godwin, Henry Holt and Co.'s associate
publisher of books for young readers. ``She creates a story that
has the rhythm of an ongoing cycle, and at the end there is a
feeling of strength and unity and that this family will go on and
do good things.''
	   Whitfield now lives in Port Washington, which overlooks the Long
Island Sound, and paints on her lap in bed.
	   ``I'm trying to show the compassion, and I want to know why?
Why? Why and nothing else,'' she says.

Alabama: The casual superstar band
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM PATTERSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ Jeff Cook strolls down the hall at
RCA Records sipping from a can of beer, wearing shorts and a
T-Shirt that strains at his belly.
	   He pokes his head in the door of a room where Randy Owen and
Mark Herndon, his band mates from Alabama, are being interviewed,
and twists his face into a good-natured stare. If they notice him,
they don't let on. Unperturbed, Cook walks away, taking another
swig from the beer.
	   The guys in Alabama aren't big on decorum or fashion, but no one
at RCA is likely to complain. Alabama has sold 58 million albums
for the company since 1979 _ more than rock greats Led Zeppelin and
the Doors.
	   ``That was one of the first things I dug about playing for
Alabama. I could wear any ... thing I wanted, and nobody ever said
anything,'' said Herndon, 43, the drummer and only band member not
related to the others. ``I was in about five bands before I got in
Alabama. All of them were very concerned with what I wore, and none
of them ever amounted to squat.''
	   That casual, workmanlike attitude has paid off, as evidenced by
the group's new double CD, ``For the Record.'' All 41 of the
group's No. 1 hits are on it, dating back to ``Tennessee River'' in
1980. Three new songs also are included.
	   Alabama plans to perform all 41 songs on the album at an Oct. 10
concert at the Las Vegas Hilton that will be available on
Pay-Per-View.
	   ``For the Record'' wasn't supposed to be available to fans. It
was sent just to country music radio stations last year so they
would have all of Alabama's big hits in one package. Joe Galante,
who runs RCA's Nashville office, thought the album made a statement
about the band and decided to put it in stores.
	   ``Careers are built a song at a time,'' he said. ``When you see
the list of No. 1 hits Alabama has earned, you understand that's
why they have been the most popular and successful band ever in
country music. The music has and will always come first for
Alabama.''
	   A survey of Alabama's No. 1 hits shows a consistent
working-class attitude (``Forty Hour Week'') and lots of tributes
to idyllic Dixie (``Dixieland Delight'').
	   They don't sing about drinking or cheating, preferring upbeat
numbers about regular people with a tinge of Southern rock. The
records, developed with producer Harold Shedd, borrow sounds from
rock bands like Toto and Exile, with soaring harmonies recalling
The Eagles.
	   The combination has been pure gold, keeping Alabama on the
charts long after most of their competition from the 1980s came and
went.
	   ``Alabama's success is because of its positive material,'' said
Owen, 48, the group's lead singer and cousin to bassist Teddy
Gentry, 46, and guitarist-fiddler Cook, 49. ``When you hear people
who absolutely no-bones do not like country music, they always
complain that they can't stand that `crying in your beer music.'''
	   Alabama began as a bar band in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, the
offshoot of boyhood bands formed in Fort Payne, Alabama, by Owen,
Gentry and Cook. They went through several drummers before Herndon
signed on in 1979, when the band was just starting to gain national
attention.
	   Alabama took off in the 1980s, and was named the best country
artist of the decade by the Academy of Country Music and Billboard
and Cashbox magazines. Their success caused the country-music
industry _ which always preferred clean-cut solo singers _ to be
more receptive to groups, even those with members sporting long
hair and beards.
	   ``We've kept it going so long because of a determination to make
one thing work instead of getting carried away with other offers,''
Owen said. ``I would love to do a movie score or a solo album, and
I've had offers to do both. ... But once you get removed from the
main deal, you lose focus.''

Domingo ties Caruso's record for Met Opera opening nights

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ In opera, as well as in baseball, records can be
tied and broken.
	   When the Metropolitan Opera opens Monday night, tenor Placido
Domingo will be singing at his 17th Met opening night, tying the 17
sung by Enrico Caruso between 1903 and 1920.
	   Domingo also will be celebrating the 30th anniversary of his Met
debut with the performance of ``Samson and Dalila,'' to be telecast
live on the U.S. PBS television network.
	   And, at 57, he still deserves his description in the Grove
Dictionary of Opera: ``Domingo is widely regarded as the supreme
lyrical-dramatic tenor of the late 20th century, a musician of
considerable depth and an actor of exceptional passion and
commitment, as well as a singer of warmth, intelligence and fine
taste.''
	   What does tying Caruso's record for opening nights mean to
Domingo?
	   ``Most importantly it means to me that the Metropolitan's
management and its audiences were happy enough with my performances
to ask me back again and again,'' Domingo says. ``It is a unique
company. ... New York is lucky to have a Metropolitan and we
singers are privileged to stand on that stage.''
	   The Met created a new production of Saint-Saens' ``Samson'' last
February partly because Domingo wanted to sing it. The bold,
bright-colored, abstract production only had nine performances.
Domingo sang the first seven. Olga Borodina, who sings Dalila on
opening night, canceled her scheduled performances then because she
was expecting a child. Denyce Graves sang instead.
	   ``I love this opera,'' the tenor says. ``Musically, it is an
example of French opera at its finest _ not only with big emotional
outbursts but also with some highly refined passages.
	   ``As for the Samson character himself, he symbolizes for me the
epitome of how a mighty man can crumble. In operatic terms, he is
one of the more interesting character studies.''
	   Domingo is approaching his 2,800th opera performance _ a big,
round number but not a record. ``I haven't done the complete
arithmetic,'' he says, ``but it'll be either October when I'm
singing `Samson' at the Met or in November in Washington when I'm
singing in `Fedora.'''
	   In May, Domingo undertook his 111th role _ ``Le Prophete,'' in
Vienna. He probably won't sing it again. His 112th role will be
Gherman in ``The Queen of Spades'' at the Met in March. It'll be
his first time singing in Russian.
	   About his unusually large number of career roles, Domingo says,
``I suppose I could live with 20 or 30 of the really great parts,
but that would not only be shortchanging myself but also the
public.
	   ``From a personal standpoint, I need challenges. For that same
reason I also seek the challenge of learning a role which is
written in the musical idiom of today _ like Ginastera's `Don
Rodrigo,' Menotti's `Goya' and most recently Abril's `Divinas
Palabras.' The curiosity to explore as much music as possible is
something that was born in me and has always stayed with me.
	   ``By the same token, I feel that the public wants to see a
performer in as many guises as possible.''
	   Domingo was born in Madrid, Jan. 21, 1941. His parents were part
of a troupe that performed traditional Spanish comic opera, which
has songs, choruses and spoken dialogue. The family moved to Mexico
when Domingo was 8.
	   After studying piano and conducting, he made his singing debut
at 16 as a baritone. His opera debut was in Monterrey, Mexico, in
1961 and his U.S. debut was in Dallas later that year. He was a
member of the Israeli National Opera, New York City Opera and
Hamburg Opera before making his Met debut Sept. 28, l968, in
``Adriana Lecouvreur'' opposite Renata Tebaldi.
	   Domingo vividly recalls his Met debut _ four days before it
originally was scheduled.
	   ``The day before, I had sung `Pagliacci' at the New York City
Opera and on the day itself I had rehearsed `Turandot' in the
afternoon. After the rehearsal I had gone home to Teaneck, New
Jersey, where my wife Marta and I were living at the time.
	   ``My parents had come to visit us for two reasons _ to be at my
Met debut as Maurizio in `Adriana Lecouvreur' four days later and
to be present for the imminent birth of our second child. I had
just sat down to dinner when the phone rang and Rudolf Bing's voice
inquired, `How are you feeling, Placido?'
	   ```Oh, fine, Mr. Bing,' was my answer. `That's good, because in
an hour from now you have to sing Maurizio. Franco Corelli just
canceled, because he is sick.'
	   ``My father and I got into the car, while my mother stayed with
Marta. As it was a very balmy evening, the windows of the car were
open. I remember that shortly after we had crossed the George
Washington Bridge I began to vocalize, knowing fully well that in
the dressing room I wouldn't even have one minute to spare. At a
red light on Broadway the people in the next car were laughing. I
interrupted my vocalizing and asked, `Where are you going?' `To the
Met' was their answer.
	   ```Well, don't laugh,' I said, `because you'll be hearing me in
a few minutes.'''
	   Domingo has gradually cut back his opera performances from 80 a
season to 60 or so. He is returning to what he calls his original
musical ambition: conducting. He made his opera conducting debut
with ``La Traviata'' at the New York City Opera in 1973.
	   The night after he sings Samson, Domingo will conduct ``Aida''
at the Met. A month later he will conduct ``Samson and Dalila'' at
the Washington Opera, where he is artistic director.
	   ``When my voice developed, you might say that I was
sidetracked,'' Domingo says. ``But the idea and inner urge to
conduct always remained with me.''

	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ With hundreds dead,
uncounted people missing and many communities still isolated, the
U.S. Agency for International Development predicted the final death
toll in the Dominican Republic from Hurricane Georges will top 500.
	   The official number from the Dominican government Saturday was
201 dead, but eyewitness accounts and relief agency reports from
areas yet to be reached by government officials indicate that
dozens more were killed, at least.
	   In many communities wiped out by floods, residents continued
searching through mud and debris for the missing.
	   ``The final death toll is almost certain to exceed 500,'' said a
statement issued Saturday by the Agency's Bureau for Humanitarian
Response.
	   Already, the Dominican Republic, on the eastern two-thirds of
the Caribbean island of Hispaniola, appears to be the country
hardest hit by Georges.
	   In addition to the deaths, damage to the nation's infrastructure
and agriculture alone from Hurricane Georges will surpass dlrs 1.2
billion, not including losses by industry and businesses, said
Temistocles Montas, aide to President Leonel Fernandez.
	   With many areas flooded and roads impassable, U.S. AID assistant
administrator Hugh Parmer said flights would to carry relief
supplies to all parts of the country.
	   A delegation of six members of the U.S. Congress arrived in
Puerto Rico Saturday and planned to continue on to the Dominican
Republic to survey the damage.
	   In Puerto Rico, electricity was restored to more than a quarter
of the power authority's customers and most of the San Juan
metropolitan area had water service, officials said Saturday.
	   Relieved that it did not suffer devastating damages from
Georges, residents and businesses in the U.S. Virgin Islands
donated items to send to Puerto Rico, St. Kitts and the Dominican
Republic. The first plane, carrying five tons of supplies, left
Saturday.
	   The territory's Gov. Roy Schneider said a dlrs 3.5 million
reverse osmosis water treatment plant, that can turn sea water into
300,000 gallons of potable water a day, will be shipped to Puerto
Rico, where more than half of the island's 3.8 million residents
remained without tap water.

	   ``Middlescence'' (Koch) _ Amy Rigby
	   Writing from a perspective she knows well, that of a 39-year-old
single mom struggling to make ends meet, Amy Rigby offers a voice
seldom heard in a music world filled with youthful angst.
	   Her songs are filled with sharp images, sung in a voice that can
be tender, playful and _ even trickier _ vulnerable, despite a
tough facade. She defines the album's title, ``Middlescence,'' as
the time of life between arrested development and hard-won
maturity.
	   The narrator of ``What I Need'' is a woman trying to entertain a
date after putting cranky kids to bed. ``What I need is for you to
disappear and still be here when he goes home,'' she sings
plaintively.
	   ``The Summer of My Wasted Youth'' is a vivid recollection of a
romance in the summer of 1983, when times were simpler and j-o-b
was a dirty word. On the winning rocker, ``All I Want,'' Rigby asks
for something seemingly simple from a man: ``Just want a little hug
and kiss from you, not a list of things I didn't do.''
	   These strengths aside, ``Middlescence'' is less consistent that
her superb 1996 solo debut, ``Diary of a Mod Housewife.'' She risks
repeating herself: ``Raising the Bar'' is an attempt to write a
blue-collar anthem that she has done better before. And she
misfires when straying from the twangy rock and ballads she does
best, like on ``Calling Professor Longhair'' and the ill-advised
cocktail lounge-styled ``Laboratory of Love.''
	   The characters Rigby sings about never give up despite obstacles
and setbacks, though. Neither should she.

	   ``Domestic Blues'' (E-Squared) _ Bap Kennedy
	   Obscure singer-songwriter Bap Kennedy may become well-known
because of the company he keeps. The latest disc by the Belfast
native features a stellar cast, including co-producer Steve Earle
on guitar, Peter Rowan on mandolin and virtuoso Jerry Douglas on
dobro and lap steel. The result is plenty of lusty picking and
playing behind Kennedy's rather ordinary Dylanesque singing.
	   But if the guests get credit for the execution on ``Domestic
Blues,'' Kennedy deserves credit for the concept _ a blend of Irish
folk with American country and bluegrass. It's the sound of Belfast
filtered through Nashville and Austin.
	   Recorded in less than a week, ``Domestic Blues'' achieves an
unvarnished, timeless quality that's charming. Eleven of the 13
songs were written by Kennedy, who shows a droll wit and focuses on
turbulent relationships such as one that leads him to conclude,
``Never let a vampire into your home.''
	   There's only one complaint: The final cut, an unlisted version
of the folk standard ``Dirty Old Town,'' comes after seven minutes
of silence. The tired gimmick of a hidden track only undermines
Kennedy's robust duet with Earle.
	   Otherwise, ``Domestic Blues'' is a fine, fun record.

	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Mo'Hogany'' (Universal Records) _ Monifah
	   Fans of Monifah's debut may find themselves asking, ``What
happened?'' after taking a listen to her disappointing second
effort, ``Mo'Hogany.''
	   When the singer came out with her first album, ``Moods ...
Moments,'' two years ago, it was a mesmerizing performance. She was
blessed with introspective, well-crafted songs that captured the
essence of her powerful, soulful voice.
	   Just about all of that is absent on ``Mo'Hogany,'' an apparent
desperate attempt to boost sales that were missing from the first
album. On her new disc, Monifah tries too hard to replicate the
formulaic music heard on the radio these days _ sample someone
else's song, sing as little as possible, and let the
rapper-of-the-moment hijack the limelight.
	   On ``Monifah's Anthem/Bad Girl,'' parts one and two, Queen Pen
raps so much you'd think it was Monifah guesting on Queen Pen's
album.
	   Throughout most of the disc, Monifah uses only about half the
power of her wonderful voice, and that's a mistake. There are few
bright spots _ the slow jam ``Suga Suga'' is among them. The only
standout on the album is ``I'm Loving You,'' a ballad in which
Monifah gives an all-out performance. Too bad she didn't do that on
the rest of the album.
	   _ By Nekesa Mumbi Moody, Associated Press Writer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Hung Jury'' (Death Row Records) _ Michel'le
	   It has been eight years since the debut of Michel'le, the soul
singer who charmed listeners with her baby speaking voice and her
booming vocals. Now back with her second album, ``Hung Jury,''
Michel'le picks up where she left off, still seducing us with her
voice.
	   One of the best songs on the album is ``Hang Time.'' She also
gets you stirred up on the fiery, ``Can I Get a Witness,'' as she
bemoans the lack of a man in her life.
	   While some of the songs are less than stellar, her pipes pick
them up a notch, and she makes you want to keep on listening. A
lesser singer might not be able to pull it off. Let's hope it's not
another eight years before we hear from her again.
	   _ By Nekesa Mumbi Moody, Associated Press Writer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Misery With a Beat'' (Spinout) _ Paul Kennerley
	   For old Rockpile fans, this is as good as it's going to get
until Nick Lowe and Dave Edmunds get back together. Rockpile
guitarist Billy Bremner even plays on one song.
	   Kennerley is a Brit who has written a bunch of country hits,
especially for the Judds. He went through a dry spell after his
marriage to Emmylou Harris faltered a few years back. Now he's back
with a 16-minute album of sad-sack pub rock. All five tunes are
driving, mid-tempo and amiably mournful.
	   It's good beer-drinking, heartache music, but the songs start
running together by the end. A ballad to break things up wouldn't
have hurt.
	   _ By Jim Patterson, Associated Press Writer.

At the Movies: `Urban Legend'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: opened Friday &QL; 
 &UR; By TED ANTHONY &QC; 
 &UR; AP National Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Memo to the makers of the new blood-and-guts
flick ``Urban Legend'': I know what you did last summer. And you
really should have kept it to yourself.
	   Perhaps the most unpleasant and gratuitously violent movie to
come down the pike in years, the campus-slasher movie ``Urban
Legend'' is aggressively, oozingly bad. Here are just a few reasons
why:
	   _A small dog gets nuked in a frat-house microwave.
	   _Nubile college girls with Wonderbra figures try not to spill
out of the latest collegiate fashions while being gutted (and
manage to keep their eyeliner and perm ringlets just so during the
whole thing). Post-sensitive hunks and fraternity troglodytes look
on with concern.
	   _After three murders, the heroine utters: ``I just gotta be
alone right now.''
	   _Everyone on campus seems to own an oversize dark parka just
like the one the killer wears. (Directors should be fined for such
unfettered fake foreshadowing.)
	   _One young woman does exercise laps in an abandoned campus pool
(yeah, right) _ IN A BIKINI.
	   You get the idea.
	   The plot, if you can call it that: Impossibly attractive young
adults (neo-Brat Packers Alicia Witt, Rebecca Gayheart, Jared Leto,
Michael Rosenbaum, Joshua Jackson, Tara Reid) at New England's
isolated Pendleton College discover their ranks shrinking rapidly
at the hands of a murderer who uses old urban legends as a template
for chaos.
	   And _ quelle shock! _ the 25th anniversary of another legendary
dormitory massacre in Stanley Hall is almost upon us. What's more,
the 1973 murders were ``covered up'' _ by the simple process of
hiding the 1973 bound volume of the student newspaper. Clearly a
conspiracy at the highest levels.
	   Could the professor who teaches the folklore class be behind
this fresh mayhem? After all, he's played by Robert ``Freddy
Krueger'' Englund. Is the culprit one of our Ivory Soap
protagonists? Or perhaps the cadaverous janitor (Julian Richings)
who looks like an extra from ``The Crucible''? Maybe the crusty
dean (John Neville, late of ``The X-Files'')? Or ALL OF THEM?
	   It's hard to understand how the public airing of the Starr
report and its explicit nonviolent sexual content alarms mainstream
Americans while this sort of unrepentant violence is mass-marketed
with glossy glee. Talk about Hollywood playing into the hands of
the conservative right.
	   Splatter movies can be, and often are, delightful. But the best
of 'em _ ``The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,'' the first ``Halloween,''
even the first ``Nightmare on Elm Street'' _ have something going
on behind the gore.
	   Wes Craven's ``Scream'' and ``Scream 2,'' for example, were
smart; the violence had a purpose. Blood was used as a backdrop to
examine some fascinating corners of American culture's prurient
side. They were self-referential, and adeptly so.
	   ``Urban Legend'' tries to do the same but ends up a
10th-generation photocopy of ``Scream'' dumbed down for the
``Dawson's Creek'' set. The pop-culture markers sprinkled
throughout are cheap highs designed to co-opt audiences into the
mediocrity. Most laughably, ``Urban Legend'' tries to piggyback
onto an issue _ campus safety, of all things.
	   The one urban legend in the film that has legs _ the old rumor
that Mikey from the Life Cereal commercials supposedly died from a
lethal combination of cola and Pop Rocks candy _ isn't even
exploited to its tragicomic potential.
	   More entertaining is Loretta Devine as Reese, the Pam
Grier-worshipping campus rent-a-cop with an attitude. And Witt's
irritable nose-ringed goth roommate shows promise but dies too
early.
	   As the film closes, a survivor ruminates: ``This'll become a
legend, too, you know.'' Nope. Ain't gonna happen. Because this
isn't entertainment. It's the cinematic equivalent of Pepsi with
your Pop Rocks _ three meals a day. Tums, please.
	   ``Urban Legend'' is directed by Jamie Blanks from a Silvio Horta
screenplay.

Hundreds of bodies believed buried in mud in Dominican Republic

<TEXT>
	   POLO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Carlos Feliz tossed aside a
polished white rock piled atop many others in his brother's front
yard, leaned against an orange tree and cried.
	   For four days, he had been digging through the mud and picking
through the rocks that Hurricane Georges washed through this small
town, and he had found only four of the six bodies he said it was
his mission to uncover.
	   ``We've been up and down the entire river and we can't find
them,'' he said. He pointed at his chest. ``I have an emptiness
that will never be filled.''
	   It was Feliz, 39, who dug out the bodies of his older brother
Julio, Julio's wife Antonia and their children: Carolina, 7, and
Paola, 3. Still missing are 18-year-old Brandy and Berenice, 13.
	   ``They're buried down there somewhere,'' Feliz said quietly,
gesturing downstream. He held a white handkerchief to his eyes.
	   Polo, a coffee- and avacado-farming town 120 miles (195
kilometers) west of the capital, Santo Domingo, was devastated by
flooding that Georges unleashed on Wednesday. Instant rivers
carried down rocks from the mountainside that crushed dozens of
houses and buried many more.
	   At least 24 people died in Polo, a town of 14,000, and at least
seven more are missing.
	   But without phone service, no one from the outside could know
about it before Saturday, when the bulldozers patched the downed
bridges and cleared at least one lane through the mud- and
rockslides.
	   The situation in Polo is now slightly better than that of
hundreds of other towns; authorities have arrived with the first
food, water and medicine. In many other towns, nobody has had
contact with the outside world since Tuesday.
	   Because of this, almost everyone in the Dominican Republic
believes most of Georges' victims have yet to be counted. The U.S.
Agency for International Development on Saturday said the death
toll in the Dominican Republic from Hurricane Georges _ which at
the time was 201 officially _ ``is almost certain to exceed 500.''
	   That will include the family of Jose Feliz _ distant relations
of Carlos _ a coffee worker down the hill who was known to friends
as Don Querendon.
	   He, his wife Lydia; their son Rafi and his wife Drake; and their
two children, 9-year-old Manguito and 4-year-old Joanna, all were
washed away when a mountain of mud and rocks poured through their
humble wood-and-corregated metal house.
	   Joselin Segura, Jose's 15-year-old nephew, waded through the
muck on Saturday to return to the house, and he picked through the
45-rpm records lying next to a smashed and overturned Wurlitzer
jukebox.
	   The family used to hold neighborhood dances with the jukebox;
they stopped because there were too many fights.
	   But Joselin would slip over to his cousin Rafi's house at night
to listen to boleros and merengues by singers like Los Reyes del
Este, Julio Morales y su trio, and Fernandito Villalona.
	   Villalona was their favorite, and Joselin sang his favorite song
_ ``Mi hermano, mi hermano,'' ``My Brother, My Brother'' _ as he
looked through the records he listened to with the cousin he said
treated him like a kid brother.
	   ``I'm thinking about how it must have been'' for the family
during the hurricane, he said. ``Trying to feel what it must have
been like.''
	   Five of the bodies were found the day after the hurricane about
a mile (kilometer) downstream; neighbors are still looking for that
of little Joanna.
	   The survivors face hardship as they look for the dead. Residents
walk a mile up the road to a trickle of water from a mountain
stream; they hope it's clean. There is little food in the stores,
and what's there is too expensive for most.
	   ``We haven't eaten since the day of the hurricane,'' said
Joselin's mother, Dalma. Joselin looked down at the muddy floor, as
if ashamed.
	   But the family continues to comb the riverbed for Joanna's body,
which they concede may never turn up.
	   ``I feel bad, but I have to take heart because I have my own
family to protect,'' said Rafi's brother, Felipe. ``I have to find
them water, and food.''
	   As for how many people Georges killed in the Dominican Republic,
probably the best answer came from Victor Terrero, the country's
undersecretary of health who lives 15 miles (25 kilometers) from
Polo.
	   ``I'll confess something to you,'' he said. ``I have no idea.''

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ David Cone allowed just one run and four hits in
seven shutout innings to win his 20th game as the New York Yankees
won their sixth straight, beating the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 3-1
Saturday.
	   Cone (20-7), scheduled to pitch Game 3 of the playoffs, struck
out eight and walked one, setting a record for most years between
20-game seasons (10). Cone, 20-3 for the New York Mets in 1988,
surpassed the mark set by Jim Kaat, who went 25-13 for Minnesota in
1966 and 21-13 for the White Sox in 1974.
	   In combining with three relievers on a seven-hitter, Cone became
the first Yankees right-hander to win 20 since Ed Figueroa went
20-9 in 1978.
 &UR; Orioles 5, Red Sox 2
	   In Boston, Bret Saberhagen gave up homers to B.J. Surhoff and
Eric Davis in his postseason tuneup as as Baltimore, out of the
playoffs for the first time since 1995, beat Boston.
	   Mo Vaughn, who began the day one point behind New York's Bernie
Williams in the AL batting race, went 1-for-3 to stay at .336 and
extended his season-high hitting streak to 15 games.
	   Dennis Eckersley set a major league record with his 1,071st
career pitching appearance, breaking a tie with Hoyt Wilhelm.
	   Armando Benitez got four outs for his 22nd save as Baltimore
stopped its six-game losing streak and ended Boston's four-game
winning streak.
 &UR; Blue Jays 5, Tigers 4, 13 innings
	   In Toronto, Roger Clemens finished the season unbeaten in his
final 22 starts but didn't get a decision as Toronto defeated
Detroit in 13 innings.
	   Clemens, who won his final 15 decisions after a loss to
Cleveland on May 29, was trying to tie Walter Johnson, Smokey Joe
Wood, Lefty Grove and Schoolboy Rowe for the AL record for most
consecutive winning decisions in a season. The major league record
of 19 is shared by Tim Keefe (1888) and Rube Marquard (1912).
	   Clemens, who finished 20-6 with a 2.65 ERA and 271 strikeouts,
gave up four runs and seven hits in eight innings, striking out 11
and walking two.
 &UR; Mariners 5, Rangers 2
	   In Seattle, Texas stumbled in its bid for home-field advantage
in the AL playoffs, losing to Seattle as Edgar Martinez went
4-for-4 with his 29th home run and two doubles.
	   Texas (87-73), which clinched the AL West on Friday, began the
day one game behind Cleveland in the fight for home-field
advantage.
	   Ken Griffey Jr., who leads the AL with 56 home runs, played all
three outfield positions for the first time in his career. He moved
to first base in the ninth inning, the second time he's ever played
the position.
 &UR; Athletics 4, Angels 3
	   In Oakland, California, Rickey Henderson singled in the winning
run in the ninth inning as Oakland beat Anaheim.
	   Eric Chavez singled with two outs off Angels closer Troy
Percival (2-7) to score Jason McDonald, who was pinch-running for
Scott Spiezio. Spiezio reached second on Justin Baughman's two-base
throwing error, then McDonald took third on Percival's wild pickoff
throw to second.
	   Percival then walked Mike Macfarlane, and Henderson singled to
left-center. It was the closer's sixth blown save.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Mark McGwire hit his record 67th and 68th home
runs Saturday, moving two ahead of Sammy Sosa and seven ahead of
Roger Maris' old record in the St. Louis Cardinals' 7-6 loss to the
Montreal Expos.
	   McGwire, who surpassed Maris' mark on Sept. 8, hit No. 67 off
Dustin Hermanson in the fourth inning then connected again in the
seventh, a two-run, 435-shot off rookie Kirk Bullinger. It was his
ninth mulithomer game this season and the 52nd of his career.
	   Montreal got the go-ahead run on ninth-inning doubles by Orlando
Cabrera and pinch-hitter Scott Livingstone off Mike Busby (5-2).
Ugueth Urbina (6-3) worked a scoreless eighth and Rick DeHart
finished for his first career save.
 &UR; Cubs 3, Astros 2
	   In Houston, Sammy Sosa fell two homers behind McGwire , but went
2-for-4 with a pair of singles and scored the go-ahead run in the
eighth.
	   Chicago (89-72) remained tied with San Francisco (89-72) for the
NL wild-card lead going into the season's final day.
	   With two outs in the ninth, closer Rod Beck fielded Dave Clark's
topper near the first-base line and made an unsuccessful attempt at
a tag. Beck's throw to first then hit Clark in the back, but plate
umpire Eric Gregg called Clark out for leaving the baseline trying
to elude the tag before the throw.
	   With the score 1-1 and one out in the eighth, Sosa singled off
Jay Powell (7-7). Mark Grace also singled, and both runners scored
on a two-out double by Gary Gaetti.
	   Mark Clark (9-14) limited the Astros to one run and five hits in
eight innings. Beck got his 50th save.
 &UR; Giants 8, Rockies 4
	   In Denver, Stan Javier homered twice to double his season total
as the surging Giants, who trailed Chicago by five games just nine
days earlier, won their sixth straight and remained tied with the
Cubs.
	   With the score 1-all, San Francisco broke open the game with a
five-run fourth. Orel Hershiser (11-10) allowing four runs and
eight hits in 5 1-3 innings.
	   Colorado's Larry Walker went 3-for-4 with his 23rd homer to
raise his league-leading average to .362, nine points ahead of New
York's John Olerud. Darryl Kile (13-17) gave up seven runs and 10
hits in six innings.
 &UR; Braves 4, Mets 0
	   In Atlanta, New York (88-73) lost its fourth straight and
dropped out of a tie for the wild-card race. The Mets, which has
five runs in its last 35 innings, must win Sunday and hope both
Chicago and San Francisco lose.
	   If that happens, there would be a three-way tie and New York
would play San Francisco at Shea Stadium on Monday. The winner
would be home against the Cubs the following day.
	   Andruw Jones hit a two-run double in the sixth off Al Leiter
(17-6).
	   The Braves became the 12th NL team this century to win at least
105 games, the first since the 1986 Mets went 108-54. Denny Neagle
(16-11) pitched two perfect innings to win his first regular-season
relief appearance since Oct. 3, 1993.
 &UR; Marlins 4, Phillies 3
	   In Miami, Curt Schilling became the fifth pitcher in major
league history to strike out 300 batters in consecutive seasons,
fanning Kevin Orie in the seventh inning of a doubleheader opener.
	   Orie was Schilling's seventh and final strikeout victim of the
game. Schilling, who struck out 319 last season, joined J.R.
Richard (1978-79), Nolan Ryan (1972-74 and 1976-77), Sandy Koufax
(1965-66) and Rube Waddell (1903-04) as the only pitchers to
accomplish the feat.
	   Florida won in the 10th inning on Dave Berg's two-out double off
Yorkis Perez (0-2). Antonio Alfonseca (4-6) pitched two innings for
the victory.
 &UR; Diamondbacks 3, Padres 2
	   In Phoenix, Matt Williams hit his 299th career homer and Gregg
Olson got his 30th save. Coupled with Tampa Bay's 6-1 loss to the
New York Yankees, the victory gave the Diamondbacks (65-96)
expansion supremacy for the year. The Devil Rays cannot finish with
more than 64 wins.
	   Anthony Telemaco (7-10) allowed five hits and two runs in 6 2-3
innings and had an RBI double. San Diego's Sterling Hitchcock (9-7)
allowed six hits and three runs in 5 1-3 innings.
 &UR; Reds 6, Pirates 2
	   In Cincinnati, Eddie Taubensee hit a three-run homer and Pete
Harnisch (14-7) became the Reds' first 14-game winner since Pete
Schourek went 18-7 in 1995.
	   Pittsburgh ran itself out of a three-run homer when Jose Guillen
passed Adrian Brown as they rounded second base on Kevin Brown's
fourth-inning drive, turning it into a two-run shot.
	   Jason Schmidt (11-14) was the loser. Pittsburgh had dropped
seven straight.

Relations thaw between developed and non-developed countries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OTTAWA (AP) _ Top environmental officials from 22 nations have
adjourned a conference after narrowing differences over steps to
implement the international treaty to combat global warming.
	   Agreement was near on a plan calling for companies in developed
countries to help developing nations reduce their so-called
greenhouse gas emissions, Canadian Environment Minister Christine
Stewart and her Brazilian counterpart, Jose Israel Vargas, told
reporters at the conclusion of the two-day meeting Saturday.
	   Under an agreement reached last year by 160 nations in Kyoto,
Japan, major industrial countries are required by the years 2008 to
2012 to cut greenhouse gas emissions by an average of 5.2 percent
from 1990 levels.
	   The pact allows industrial nations to meet their obligations to
reduce the gases by helping developing countries reduce theirs.
	   The plan discussed this week in the Canadian capital is viewed
by officials as a way for developing nations to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions without curbing their economic progress.
	   ``I think (the mechanism) creates a friendly symmetry between
developing countries and developed countries like Canada,'' Vargas
said.
	   Scientists say rising concentrations of heat-trapping gases in
the atmosphere are warming the surface temperature of the Earth and
disrupting weather patterns.
	   They predict that if current pollution trends continue, there
will be more frequent extreme weather events such as heat waves,
droughts, storms and floods, and sea levels will rise.

	   UNCASVILLE, Connecticut (AP) _ Lennox Lewis, who had described
himself as a one-punch knockout artist, had to settle for a
12-round unanimous decision over Zeljko Mavrovic in a heavyweight
tent show at the Mohegan Sun casino.
	   There was no question that Lewis was the harder puncher Saturday

 &UR; Eds: INSERTS second game of Phillies-Marlins doubleheader &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Mark McGwire hit his record 67th and 68th home
runs Saturday, moving two ahead of Sammy Sosa and seven ahead of
Roger Maris' old record in the St. Louis Cardinals' 7-6 loss to the
Montreal Expos.
	   McGwire, who surpassed Maris' mark on Sept. 8, hit No. 67 off
Dustin Hermanson in the fourth inning then connected again in the
seventh, a two-run, 435-foot (132 1/2-meter) shot off rookie Kirk
Bullinger. It was his ninth mulithomer game this season and the
52nd of his career.
	   Montreal got the go-ahead run on ninth-inning doubles by Orlando
Cabrera and pinch-hitter Scott Livingstone off Mike Busby (5-2).
Ugueth Urbina (6-3) worked a scoreless eighth and Rick DeHart
finished for his first career save.
 &UR; Cubs 3, Astros 2
	   In Houston, Sammy Sosa fell two homers behind McGwire , but went
2-for-4 with a pair of singles and scored the go-ahead run in the
eighth.
	   Chicago (89-72) remained tied with San Francisco (89-72) for the
NL wild-card lead going into the season's final day.
	   With two outs in the ninth, closer Rod Beck fielded Dave Clark's
topper near the first-base line and made an unsuccessful attempt at
a tag. Beck's throw to first then hit Clark in the back, but plate
umpire Eric Gregg called Clark out for leaving the baseline trying
to elude the tag before the throw.
	   With the score 1-1 and one out in the eighth, Sosa singled off
Jay Powell (7-7). Mark Grace also singled, and both runners scored
on a two-out double by Gary Gaetti.
	   Mark Clark (9-14) limited the Astros to one run and five hits in
eight innings. Beck got his 50th save.
 &UR; Giants 8, Rockies 4
	   In Denver, Stan Javier homered twice to double his season total
as the surging Giants, who trailed Chicago by five games just nine
days earlier, won their sixth straight and remained tied with the
Cubs.
	   With the score 1-all, San Francisco broke open the game with a
five-run fourth. Orel Hershiser (11-10) allowing four runs and
eight hits in 5 1-3 innings.
	   Colorado's Larry Walker went 3-for-4 with his 23rd homer to
raise his league-leading average to .362, nine points ahead of New
York's John Olerud. Darryl Kile (13-17) gave up seven runs and 10
hits in six innings.
 &UR; Braves 4, Mets 0
	   In Atlanta, New York (88-73) lost its fourth straight and
dropped out of a tie for the wild-card race. The Mets, which has
five runs in its last 35 innings, must win Sunday and hope both
Chicago and San Francisco lose.
	   If that happens, there would be a three-way tie and New York
would play San Francisco at Shea Stadium on Monday. The winner
would be home against the Cubs the following day.
	   Andruw Jones hit a two-run double in the sixth off Al Leiter
(17-6).
	   The Braves became the 12th NL team this century to win at least
105 games, the first since the 1986 Mets went 108-54. Denny Neagle
(16-11) pitched two perfect innings to win his first regular-season
relief appearance since Oct. 3, 1993.
 &UR; Marlins 4, Phillies 3
 &UR; Marlins 1, Phillies 0
	   In Miami, Curt Schilling became the fifth pitcher in major
league history to strike out 300 batters in consecutive seasons,
fanning Kevin Orie in the seventh inning of a doubleheader opener.
	   Orie was Schilling's seventh and final strikeout victim of the
game. Schilling, who struck out 319 last season, joined J.R.
Richard (1978-79), Nolan Ryan (1972-74 and 1976-77), Sandy Koufax
(1965-66) and Rube Waddell (1903-04) as the only pitchers to
accomplish the feat.
	   Florida won in the 10th inning on Dave Berg's two-out double off
Yorkis Perez (0-2). Antonio Alfonseca (4-6) pitched two innings for
the victory.
	   In the second game, Alex Gonzalez's 13th-inning homer off Ricky
Bottalico (1-5) gave the Marlins their first-ever doubleheader
sweep. Rob Stanifer (2-4) faced one batter, throwing a called third
strike past Mark Lewis with the bases loaded in the top half.
 &UR; Diamondbacks 3, Padres 2
	   In Phoenix, Matt Williams hit his 299th career homer and Gregg
Olson got his 30th save. Coupled with Tampa Bay's 6-1 loss to the
New York Yankees, the victory gave the Diamondbacks (65-96)
expansion supremacy for the year. The Devil Rays cannot finish with
more than 64 wins.
	   Anthony Telemaco (7-10) allowed five hits and two runs in 6 2-3
innings and had an RBI double. San Diego's Sterling Hitchcock (9-7)
allowed six hits and three runs in 5 1-3 innings.
 &UR; Reds 6, Pirates 2
	   In Cincinnati, Eddie Taubensee hit a three-run homer and Pete
Harnisch (14-7) became the Reds' first 14-game winner since Pete
Schourek went 18-7 in 1995.
	   Pittsburgh ran itself out of a three-run homer when Jose Guillen
passed Adrian Brown as they rounded second base on Kevin Brown's
fourth-inning drive, turning it into a two-run shot.
	   Jason Schmidt (11-14) was the loser. Pittsburgh had dropped
seven straight.

State ordered to switch off gas as fire threat continues at plant
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ More than one million people were
ordered Sunday to shut off the gas to their homes and businesses as
a fire continued to burn at Victoria state's biggest gas facility.
	   About 4,000 volunteers Sunday visited almost every Victorian
home to tell residents to turn off their gas meters, as authorities
warned the supply crisis could last months.
	   A massive fire broke out Friday at the Esso gas plant about 110
miles (180 km) east of Melbourne, killing two people and injuring
eight. The plant supplies 80 percent of Victoria's gas.
	   More than 200 people are working around the clock to repair
damage from the explosion and fire, which was still burning Sunday,
though much smaller.
	   Firefighters warned further gas leaks could restart a major
fire.
	   ``The risk is very much diminished, but there is still an issue
there of any other gas leaks in the area,'' Country Fire Authority
spokesman John Tindall said.
	   Police were on standby to enforce the order to switch off gas
meters if households failed to comply, said David Guthrie-Jones, a
spokesman for the state's main supply authority, VENCorp.
	   If the gas supply grid empties and has to be shut down it will
take weeks to clear air and water from the pipes and restart the
grid, VENCorp said.
	   Gas from neighboring New South Wales state was being fed into
Victoria's grid in an effort to keep it open, and was supplying
about 10 percent of normal requirements, the company said.
	   Esso experts are flying in from overseas to inspect the facility
and to determine the cause of the fire, corporate and external
affairs manager Ron Webb said.
	   ``At this stage, it is too early to forecast on when gas
production can be resumed safely,'' Webb said.
	   Arson squad police were at the scene and would begin sifting
through the debris as soon as it became accessible, a police
spokesman said.
	   An arson investigation was routine because deaths had occurred,
said the spokesman, who requested anonymity.
	   Police named the two dead men Sunday as maintenance supervisors
John Francis Lowery and Peter Wilson.
	   The Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry
predicted economic chaos unless supply resumed before Monday.
	   ``The damage is approaching the incalculable,'' chief executive
officer David Edwards said Saturday.
	   The bans on gas use mean no non-essential consumers are exempt,
including restaurants, hotels and bakeries. The ban also covers
heaters, hot water systems and stoves.
	   Under emergency powers invoked by the state government, people
who use gas appliances are subject to a 500 Australian dollars
(U.S. dlrs 290) penalty for the first offense and 100 Australian
dollars (U.S. dlrs 58) for each repeated offense, he said.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ David Cone allowed just one run and four hits in
seven shutout innings to win his 20th game as the New York Yankees
won their sixth straight, beating the Tampa Bay Devil Rays 3-1
Saturday.
	   Cone (20-7), scheduled to pitch Game 3 of the playoffs against
Texas, struck out eight and walked one, setting a record for most
years between 20-game seasons (10). Cone, 20-3 for the New York
Mets in 1988, surpassed the mark set by Jim Kaat, who went 25-13
for Minnesota in 1966 and 21-13 for the White Sox in 1974.
	   In combining with three relievers on a seven-hitter, Cone became
the first Yankees right-hander to win 20 since Ed Figueroa went
20-9 in 1978.
 &UR; Indians 9, Twins 5
	   In Minneapolis, David Justice homered and tied a career-high
with five RBIs as Cleveland stopped a five-game losing streak and
clinched the home-field advantage in the first round of the
playoffs. The Indians open Tuesday against Boston. Manny Ramirez
added a two-run double, giving him 145 RBIs.
	   Charles Nagy had his first bad outing in more than a month,
giving up four runs and seven hits and four runs in just three
innings before Dave Burba (15-10) relieved.
	   Bob Tewksbury (7-13) allowed six runs and eight hits in 5 1-3
innings.
 &UR; Orioles 5, Red Sox 2
	   In Boston, Bret Saberhagen gave up homers to B.J. Surhoff and
Eric Davis in his postseason tuneup as as Baltimore, out of the
playoffs for the first time since 1995, beat Boston.
	   Mo Vaughn, who began the day one point behind New York's Bernie
Williams in the AL batting race, went 1-for-3 to stay at .336 and
extended his season-high hitting streak to 15 games.
	   Dennis Eckersley set a major league record with his 1,071st
career pitching appearance, breaking a tie with Hoyt Wilhelm.
	   Armando Benitez got four outs for his 22nd save as Baltimore
stopped its six-game losing streak and ended Boston's four-game
winning streak.
 &UR; Blue Jays 5, Tigers 4
	   In Toronto, Roger Clemens finished the season unbeaten in his
final 22 starts but didn't get a decision as Toronto defeated
Detroit in 13 innings.
	   Clemens, who won his final 15 decisions after a loss to
Cleveland on May 29, was trying to tie Walter Johnson, Smokey Joe
Wood, Lefty Grove and Schoolboy Rowe for the AL record for most
consecutive winning decisions in a season. The major league record
of 19 is shared by Tim Keefe (1888) and Rube Marquard (1912).
	   Clemens, who finished 20-6 with a 2.65 ERA and 271 strikeouts,
gave up four runs and seven hits in eight innings, striking out 11
and walking two.
 &UR; Mariners 5, Rangers 2
	   In Seattle, Texas, which clinched the AL West on Friday,

losing to Seattle as Edgar Martinez went 4-for-4 with his 29th home
run and two doubles.
	   Ken Griffey Jr., who leads the AL with 56 home runs, played all
three outfield positions for the first time in his career. He moved
to first base in the ninth inning, the second time he's ever played
the position.
 &UR; Athletics 4, Angels 3
	   In Oakland, California, Rickey Henderson singled in the winning
run in the ninth inning.
	   Eric Chavez singled with two outs off Angels closer Troy
Percival (2-7) to score Jason McDonald, who was pinch-running for
Scott Spiezio. Spiezio reached second on Justin Baughman's two-base
throwing error, then McDonald took third on Percival's wild pickoff
throw to second.
	   Percival then walked Mike Macfarlane, and Henderson singled to
left-center. It was the closer's sixth blown save.
 &UR; White Sox 13, Royals 5
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Frank Thomas and Albert Belle hit
consecutive home runs in the fifth inning and rookie Brian Simmons
hit his first two major league homers. The four home runs raised
Chicago's total to a team-record 196, one more than the White Sox
hit two years ago.
	   Jim Abbott (5-0) won despite allowing five runs and 10 hits in
five innings, and Brian Barber (2-4) lost. Belle's homer was his
48th, his 30th since the All-Star break.

	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) - NATO forces in Bosnia detained indicted
war criminal Stevan Todorovic early Sunday and sent him to the
International War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands for
trial on charges of murder.
	   A statement issued from NATO headquarters in Brussels said
Todorovic served as chief of police in Bosanski Samac between June
13 and July 28, 1992.
	   Todorovic is accused of ``wilful killing and murder, wilfully
causing great suffering, cruel treatment, inhuman acts, inhumane
treatment, rape and torture, violations of the laws or customs of
war, grave breaches and crimes against humanity,'' NATO said.
	   Details of the detention were not immediately available.
	   ``This action serves as yet another warming to all those
indicted for war crimes who are still at large that they will not
escape justice,'' NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said in a
statement early Sunday morning.
	   ``I advise them to surrender immediately to the ICTY. The
parties to the peace agreement must also comply fully with their
commitment to transfer indicted war criminals to the ICTY.''

Lewis beats challenger from Croatia

	   UNCASVILLE, Connecticut (AP) _ Lennox Lewis huffed and puffed,
but he couldn't knock Zeljko Mavrovic down.
	   The WBC heavyweight champion, however, did beat the challenger
from Croatia in a unanimous decision Saturday night before about
4,000 fans in a tent at Mohegan Sun casino.
	   ``Lennox definitely was huffing and puffing by the third
round,'' his trainer, Emanuel Stewart, said. ``I can't explain why.
Lennox definitely trained hard for this fight.''
	   The 243-pound (110.2-kilo) Lewis, however, had enough stamina to
be in complete control over the last eight rounds when he landed
several solid right uppercuts and stiff left jabs, which were his
two most effective punches.
	   ``In the later rounds, 8, 9, 10 and 11, he caught me and I
couldn't come inside,'' the 214\-pound (97.1-kilo) Mavrovic said.
``I'm tired, and he punched me unlike anyone else in the world.''
	   It was the European champion's first defeat after 27 victories,
22 by knockout.
	   The victory moved Lewis, 24-1 with 27 knockouts, a step closer
to a unification bout with IBF-WBA champion Evander Holyfield.
	   ``He knows where to find me,'' Lewis said. ``It's up to him to
sign the contract.''
	   Holyfield, however, now faces a WBA mandatory defense against
Henry Akinwande. He made an IBF mandatory defense Sept. 19 and won
a unanimous decision over Vaughn Bean.
	   ``I was pleased with my performance,'' the 33-year old Lewis, of
Britain, said. ``I adjusted well in the ring. I expected Mavrovic
to run.''
	   Mavrovic tried to stay in close with Lewis but simply didn't
have the power to take control of the fight. His best round was the
seventh when he shook Lewis with a couple of two-punch combos to
the head late in the round.
	   There was no question that Lewis had a big edge in power, but
the fighter who calls himself a one-punch knockout artist never
came close to knocking down Mavrovic.
	   Mavrovic was marked about both eyes, and Lewis was cut in the
mouth.
	   Judge Franfisco Ciminale of Italy scored it 117-111, Tommy
Kaczmarak of New Jersey had it 119-109 and Bob Logist of Belgium
saw it 117-112.
	   The Associated Press scored it 117-111 for Lewis.
	   ``I said before the fight `You are my friend' and I meant `You
are my friend,''' Mavrovic said in the ring. ``You beat me, and
nobody ever beat me before.''
	   Mavrovic boxed well in the first few rounds before Lewis took
charge in the fourth, landing several hard rights to the head and a
good shot to the body. In the fifth round, Lewis landed several
good jabs and left hooks and a right to the body that made Mavrovic
grunt.
	   The best round of the fight was the 11th when Mavrovic landed a
one-two in mid-round and then a hard left with 50 seconds left
followed by a one-two to the head.
	   Lewis then rallied with a right uppercut and a hook to the head
followed by two left-right combinations and bulled Mavrovic into
the ropes at round's end.
	   ``Mavrovic must have 240 pounds (109 kilos) of steel in his
chin,'' said Frank Maloney, Lewis' manager.
	   A CompuBox analysis of the fight showed Lewis landed 216 of 507
punches in this mandatory WBC heavyweight defense. Mavrovic landed
132 of 298 punches.
