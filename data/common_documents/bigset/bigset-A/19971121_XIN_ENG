BRUSSELS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission today
announced that it will contribute another 100 million ECU (113
million U.S. dollars) to the final shut-down of the Chernobyl
nuclear power plant in Ukraine.

The donation, committed by the executive body of the 15-nation
European Union, doubles the amount it has contributed to Chernobyl.

<P>
EU's foreign affairs commissioner Hans van den Broek said that
the EU has offered a substantial contribution to make the damaged
Unit 4 reactor safe in Chernobyl.
</P>
<P>
"We now urge the rest of the international community to do its
share," said van den Broek, who said that a permanent closure of
the Chernobyl plant by the year 2000 remains the final target of
the commission.
</P>
<P>
The latest EU contribution followed a decision made the
Group-of-Seven industrial nations in Denver, United States, last
June to finance 261.6 million ECU (300 million dollars) to make
the reactor safe. The total need is estimated at 654 million ECU
(750 million dollars).

<P>
HARARE, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's stock market,the
second largest stock market in Africa, today continued its
free-fall when it lost a 668.51 points, in a record single day
plunge, on the back of waning investor's confidence about the
future of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Stockbrokers reiterated that the panic on the local bourse was
a result of uncertainty over the huge payments to be made to
former freedom veterans by the government, the threat of
nationalisation of commercial farms for resettlement of landless
peasants and last week's sharp devaluation of the Zimbabwe
Dollar.
</P>
<P>
The industrial index, which is the country's economic
barometer, fell by another all time record of 500 points on
Wednesday. It now stands at 8,457.99.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said although the government had taken measures to
arrest the drop in the local currency, resumption of the balance
of payments support from the International Monetary Fund is
crucial to further stabilize the dollar.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. trade deficit
soared 17 percent in September as imports from Asia helped widen
the trade gap, the Commerce Department said here today.
</P>
<P>
A report released by the department said the deficit in
September was 11.1 billion U.S. dollars, the worst since January.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. imports rose 1.2 percent to a new record of 89.1
billion dollars in September, while exports slipped by 0.7 percent
to 78 billion.
</P>
<P>
The deficit with Japan rose 6.9 percent to 5.1 billion dollars,

<P>
Deficit with its two neighboring partners also increased. The

<HEADLINE> African Debts Reduce Confidence Among Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The debt situation in many
African countries has led to a significant loss in confidence
among foreign investors, an African Development Bank (ADB)
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Visiting ADB's Risk Management Unit chief Tim Turner said in
an interview with the Zimbabwe News Agency that the situation in
the past few years had become worse as it reduced most African
countries to dependents of the west.
</P>
<P>
"Debt is not really a problem, but the big problem lies with
certain financial institutions which dictate to countries what
the money borrowed should be used for," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said countries had their own priorities and should be given
the chance to fulfill them before money lenders intervene to
dictate what best suits them.
</P>
<P>
Although Turner admitted that the ADB was being influenced on
some of its policies by the International Monetary Fund and the
World Bank, he said the bank would strive to maintain its
"Africanness".
</P>
<P>
"We want to help different sections of economies in Africa, no
matter how big or small they are. We will support any measures
that increase private sector participation and other measures
that instill financial discipline," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
ADB this year committed 2.6 billion Zimbabwe Dollars (180
million U.S. Dollars) for social and economic projects to
Zimbabwe in recognition of the country's efforts to bring
financial discipline in its economy as well as taking measures to
address its economic woes during the next phase of its reform
program, Turner said.

<HEADLINE> Queen Elizabeth Pledges to Listen to People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Queen Elizabeth and Prince
Philip on Thursday celebrated their golden wedding anniversary
with a promise to listen to the people.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a government banquet on the anniversary of her
golden wedding, the queen said the monarchy existed only "with the
people's support and consent."
</P>
<P>
"The message to a Royal family is sometimes obscured by
deference, rhetoric or the conflicting currents of public
opinion," she said.
</P>
<P>
The luncheon for 300 guests was staged at the Banqueting Hall
where Charles I was executed in 1649.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the host and Prime Minister Tony Blair, four former
British prime ministers, seven kings, 10 queens, a grand duke, 26
princes and 27 princesses were also present at the grand banquet
after attending a ceremony at the Westminster Abbey for the
biggest regal gathering since Elizabeth's coronation in 1953.
</P>
<P>
She was greeted at the entrance to the abbey by a fanfare of
trumpets and then the congregation joined in "Praise My Soul The
King of Heaven", one of her favorite hymns that was played at
their wedding.
</P>
<P>
The Royal family's popularity, already shaky following a decade
of scandal and marital breakdown among the younger royals,
plummeted following the death of the publicly-adored Princess
Diana at the end of August.
</P>
<P>
Since then, royal officials have made clear that ways of
modernizing the 1,000-year-old monarchy are under consideration.
But a poll released on the eve of the anniversary showed that
there is far to go.
</P>
<P>
Only one in five young people considered the monarchy
important, while overall backing for the royals had plunged from
65 percent in 1983 to 32 percent today.
</P>
<P>
"Young people are certainly less in awe of traditional British
institutions," the annual British Social Attitudes survey
concluded.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair praised Queen Elizabeth today for being "unstuffy, unfussy
and unfazed by anything".
</P>
<P>
At a "People's Banquet" to celebrate the 50th wedding
anniversary of the queen and Prince Philip, Blair said the Royal
family had steered "through the terrible test" of Princess Diana's
death in a car crash on August 31.
</P>
<P>
After Diana's death, the 1,000-year-old monarchy was criticized
for not immediately joining in the spontaneous national outpouring
of grief. But Blair stoutly defended the Royal family.
</P>
<P>
Blair told the queen: "You are our queen. We respect and
cherish you. You are simply the best of British."
</P>
<P>
"I know from the conversations we had during those days how
deeply you felt those events for yourself, Prince Charles and the
boys," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I know too, contrary to some of the hurtful things that were
said at the time, how moved you were by the outpouring of grief
which followed as, in the security of your own home, you sought as
a family to help the boys."
</P>
<P>
Present at the banquet held at the Banqueting Hall were 300
guests, including the four former British prime ministers, seven
kings, 10 queens 26 princes and 27 princesses from around the
world.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Secretary-General: Diplomacy Works </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Encouraged by Iraq's
decision to allow U.N. arms inspectors to resume work in the
country on Friday, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said today
that the new development is a proof of diplomacy's role.
</P>
<P>
"It proves that diplomacy sometimes works and you don't always
have to fight to win," Annan told reporters when entering the U.N.
headquarters this morning.
</P>
<P>
Iraq on Thursday announced that it agreed to allow U.S. arms
inspectors back into the country, ending three weeks of defiance
of U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The announcement followed a ministerial meeting in Geneva by
foreign ministers of France, Britain, Russia and the U.S. and the
representative of China. The participants urged Iraq to
unconditionally accept the return of the U.N. inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he hopes that all inspectors will be back in Iraq by
Friday since they are only an hour or so from Baghdad. Iraq
ordered out the Americans in the inspection teams last Thursday
while chief U.N. inspector Richard Butler pulled out all inspectors
who are currently staying in Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
The United States has increased its military presence in the
Gulf area while seeking diplomatic solutions.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council Special Commission on Iraq will hold
an emergency meeting Friday to discuss the latest developments.
</P>
<P>
Asked if it is time to review the question of the whole
sanctions regime against Iraq, Annan said it is part of the
current discussions.
</P>
<P>
"There has been indications that we will look at it," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I think that the food-for-oil can be strengthened and can work
better," he said, adding "we are determined to make it work."

<HEADLINE> Clinton: U.S. to "Wait and See" Iraq's Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton,
wary of Iraq's permission to allow U.N. weapons inspectors
including Americans back on their work, said on Thursday that he
will "wait and see" Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's next
action.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's Revolutionary Command Council earlier issued a
statement, saying "Iraq has accepted the return of U.N. Special
Commission (UNSCOM) inspectors, including the Americans," to
Baghdad and resume their work.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said it was not enough to just make a statement by
Saddam Hussein, "We will wait and see" if he does what he says, he
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
"The United States must remain and will remain resolute in
our determination to prevent him from threatening his neighbors
of the world with nuclear, chemical or biological weapons," the
president said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the White House welcomed Iraq's decision to reverse
his ban on American weapons inspectors, saying it was "an
encouraging development."
</P>
<P>
But the statement "must ultimately be tested by what Saddam
Hussein does," White House spokeswoman Anne Luzzatto said. "We
have to see how it unfolds."
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, now in Geneva
attending an emergency meeting with four other permanent members
of U.N. Security Council on the weapons inspection crisis,
called Iraq's decision "a step in the right direction."
</P>
<P>
"It's the secretary's view that the announcement out of
Baghdad is a step in the right direction," said State Department
spokesman James Rubin, who is accompanying Albright on her world
travel.
</P>
<P>
"Our objective was to see the unconditional return of the
U.N. inspectors. Our strategy was to combine intensive
diplomacy, that is the unity of the major powers, with a robust
military posture and if the inspectors return, then our
objectives will have been met," he said.

<P>
NEW YORK, November 20 (Xinhua) -- A New York subway train
kissed another during busy hours this morning, injuring more than
75 commuters.
</P>
<P>
Sources said most injuries were minor. Even the seven people
taken to the hospitals were not suffering life-threatening injuries.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of others were treated at the scene for bumps and
bruises.
</P>
<P>
The crash happened at the Steinway Street station in the Long
Island City-Astoria area of Queens.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that an eastbound "G" train, heading from
Brooklyn to Queens, rear-ended a "R" train about 8:40 a.m. The "R"
train, which was outbound from Manhattan, was partially in the
station when it was struck, he said. Damage to the trains was
minor.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Chief U.N. weapons
inspector Richard Butler on Thursday expected the return of
inspectors including Americans to Baghdad on Friday following
Iraq's permission.
</P>
<P>
"At first light tomorrow we'll be off and back to Baghdad
provided that what we've heard on the wire services is right, that
Iraq really has decided this..." Butler told ABC's Good Morning
America in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Iraq earlier made a statement that it decided to allow U.N.
weapons inspectors including Americans back to Baghdad and resume
their work.
</P>
<P>
"We won't be able to fly this afternoon because when it gets
dark it's best not to operate our aircraft under those
conditions," Butler said.
</P>
<P>
More than 70 U.N. inspectors left Baghdad last Friday after
Iraq expelled six American inspectors, accused of spying for the
United States under the guise of U.N. weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
"We'll be on the plane tomorrow and back in business on
Friday," Butler said.

WASHINGTON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) today announced the approval of a 13.8
million U.S. dollar concessional loan to Honduras for a pilot
program in Puerto Cortes city's water and sanitation services.
</P>
<P>
The project is to serve as a model for additional IDB lending
to the water and sanitation sector in the country.
</P>
<P>
A modern sewerage system will be built to service an estimated
56 percent of the city's 51,000 people. Presently, only about one
third of the population is connected to a sewerage system.
</P>
<P>
In the area of institutional reform, the municipal water
division will be converted into a commercial company owned by both
the municipality and the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the program is some 16.2 million dollars.
Local counterpart funds total 2.4 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> World Gold Demand Reaches Record Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- World demand for gold in the
first nine months of this year reached record levels despite of
the recent currency and stock markets turmoil in some big Asian
markets, Financial Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Citing figures from the World Gold Council (WGC), the newspaper
said that gold demand in the first nine months of 1997 was at
2,191 tons, 11 percent up over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, gold demand in the fourth quarter also started
strongly and the manager of gold market analysis of WGC George
Milling-Stanley was quoted as saying that "there is a very good
chance it (1997) will be a record year".
</P>
<P>
The WGC, which is funded by gold producers and monitors markets
accounting for 80 percent of total demand, said that india, the
largest gold consuming nation, was the driving force behind the
record.
</P>
<P>
Indian gold demand in the nine months amounted to 535 tons,
44 percent up and ahead of the 508 tons for all of last year.
</P>
<P>
The WGC dismissed the idea that gold demand was being driven to
record levels entirely by low prices, saying that the strength of
the US dollar, which is used for the international price of gold,
had made the metal seem much more expensive in some countries.

<HEADLINE> African Day of Industrialization Marked in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Cameroonian government
has decided to encourage private initiative in the creation of
small and medium sized enterprises as the most important aspect
of its industrialization drive, a senior official said today.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Trade and Industry Justin Ndioro made the
statement this morning in Yaounde during the commemoration of the
8th African Day of Industrialization.
</P>
<P>
The day is celebrated this year under the theme "social
economic impact of small and medium sized enterprises on the life
of the people of Africa."
</P>
<P>
The African Industrialization Day was instituted in 1990 by
the United Nations. The day November 20 was chosen to promote the
development of industries in all the countries in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The minister noted that the creation of small and medium sized
enterprises in Africa provides the best solution to unemployment
and at the same time such enterprises can easily be managed and
can be created in both rural and urban areas.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government of Cameroon has taken a
series of measures to facilitate the creation of small and medium
sized enterprises, especially with structures like the National
Employment Fund and the Trade and Industry Special Program in
this domain.
</P>
<P>
The minister seized the opportunity to launch the fifth
edition of the National Handicraft Day, adding that handicraft is
the first step toward industrialization in Cameroon.

At least six people have been killed in the Djibouti City by

<P>
It is not known whether the out-break of the epidemic is
connected with flooding in neighboring Somalia.

"Sanitary situation, plus the persistent degradation of
weather conditions, also led to the mobilization of helicopters
(of the French army) to help the people in the interior of the
country." said the defense ministry in a communique.

France has 3,200 troops deployed in Djibouti, a strategical

<HEADLINE> U.S. Banks Suffer Losses in Latin America, Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Major U.S. banks lost up to
400 million U.S. dollars trading in volatile Latin American and
Russian emerging markets in October.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of the USA Today, Most of the damage was
inflicted on Chase Manhattan, the nation's largest bank.
</P>
<P>
It acknowledges pretax losses of 160 million last month,
stemming mostly from declines in the value of emerging-market debt
and Euro-bonds it held or sold, the paper said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The only other bank to publicly announce trading losses for
October is BankBoston, which had a loss of 20 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The majority of other aggressive emerging-market players --
such as commercial banks J.P. Morgan and Citibank, and investment
houses Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley -- say losses were not
material to overall earnings.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that losses, expected to be included in
fourth-quarter earnings reports, are far less than feared from
last month's dust-up when many emerging markets suddenly crashed
almost 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Those markets have recovered somewhat in recent weeks, but
volatility is expected to remain, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Some traders say the heaviest losses may have been absorbed
by European banks, some of whom are aggressive players in Latin
America and Eastern Europe.

<HEADLINE> Rwanda: 300 Killed in Jail Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Some 300 people died earlier
this week in a battle that ensued after Hutu rebels tried to free
inmates from a prison in Rwanda's northwest Gisenyi prefecture,
BBC radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The jail in Giciye was holding prisoners awaiting trial in
connection with the 1994 genocide, U.N.'s Integrated Regional
Information Network (IRIN) quoted the BBC report as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Rwandan authorities claimed that about 1,200 militiamen
took part in the attack.
</P>
<P>
During the clash, 88 prisoners died and 93 inmates reportedly
escaped while the Rwandan army says it killed around 200 rebels.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to IRIN, Emmanuel Gasana, an adviser to Rwanda's
Vice-President and Defense Minister Paul Kagame, described the
clash as a "very major battle" which last several hours.
</P>
<P>
"There has to be a military solution and it will be very
soon," he noted.
</P>
<P>
According to Rwandan military sources, the prison was badly
damaged by artillery fire although it was unclear whether this
came from the rebels or the army.
</P>
<P>
Mopping-up operations were still continuing, the army said
today.
</P>
<P>
About 15,000 Hutu rebels are reportedly active in northwest
Rwanda, the government estimated.

<HEADLINE> Britain not to Seek Police Probe on Patten Book </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The British government would
not seek an investigation into whether revelations in a biograph
about the last Hong Kong governor breached Britain's Official
Secrets Act, a minister said today.
</P>
<P>
Attorney General John Morris said in a written answer to a
parliamentary question that he had decided to rule out a police
probe after being influenced by "intelligence and foreign
relations considerations".
</P>
<P>
"I concluded that intelligence and foreign relations
considerations outweighed other public interest considerations
which might otherwise have required a prosecution in respect of
any offence established by a criminal investigation," Morris said.
</P>
<P>
"It followed that no useful purpose would have been served for
there to have been a police investigation in this matter," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The book, The Last Governor, was written by journalist Jonathan
Dimbleby with the cooperation of Chris Patten, the last Hong Kong
governor.
</P>
<P>
Newspaper reports in Britain earlier this year said that
Britain's MI6 security service was looking at how Dimbleby came to
have access to information about how the 1987 survey was compiled.
</P>
<P>
But Patten has consistently denied that he leaked official
secrets to the author.

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales in UK Rebounded in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 20 (Xinhua) - The Confederation of British
Industry (CBI) reported that sales volumes reached their strongest
level for a year in October after having been held back last month
owing to the death of Diana, Princess of Wales.
</P>
<P>
According to its latest trades survey the level of activity on
the high street last month was well above average for the time of
year, with sales increasing at their quickest rate since November
1996.
</P>
<P>
The CBI said the underlying trend suggested that a slowdown in
sales growth since midsummer has levelled off. Retailers have
became more optimistic about sales prospects for the next few
months.
</P>
<P>
Alastair Eperon, chairman of the CBI's survey panel, said:
"This survey paints a more promising picture for retailers, as
overall sales volumes in October increased at their fastest rate
for almost a year."
</P>
<P>
Official figures, released on Wednesday reveal a surge of 2.8
percent in the volume of goods sold last month after the fall of
1.7 percent recorded in September.
</P>
<P>
The volume of goods sold last month was 6.4 percent higher than
a year earlier, a pace last seen during the 1980s consumer boom.
</P>
<P>
Mark Wall, of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, said: "The UK consumer
is alive and kicking and looks set to remain robust into next
year."
</P>
<P>
However, economists in the City commonly believe that the
stronger-than-expected rebound, to an annual growth rate of 6.4
percent from 3.8 percent, fuelled fears that the Bank of England
would respond by raising interest rates again to quell
inflationary pressures.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopian PM on Probe to Rwanda's Genocide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi today urged "the establishment of an international
body of eminent personalities to investigate the genocide in
Rwanda and the surrounding events."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the matter is so serious that there is probably
no greater issue that warrants the urgent attention of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
Over half a million civilians were killed in the genocide
which happened in 1994. Some said up to a million people were
slaughtered in retaliation for the killing of the Rwandan
president when his plane was shot down.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister made the remarks when addressing the
opening session of the 7th ordinary session of the Central Organ
of the OAU Mechanism for Conflict Prevention, Management and
Resolution at ministerial level here.
</P>
<P>
Meles said that "the talk about building our capacity for
early warning and for prevention of conflicts would remain empty
talk if we continue to fail drawing lessons from the most tragic
experience we have had."
</P>
<P>
"The OAU can move forward in the Great Lakes region only if it
has managed to uncover through an objective investigation what
went wrong in Rwanda for the genocide to take place," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian prime minister, the genocide in
Rwanda which has no parallel anywhere in the world since the
Second World War.
</P>
<P>
"This unimaginable tragedy in which close to a million people
were butchered, 95 percent of whom are civilians, including the
very young and the infant," Meles said.
</P>
<P>
He also commended the OAU for its peace initiative in the
African region and OAU members for its efforts so far exerted to
resolve conflicts in their respective sub-regions and in
enhancing OAU's capacity for peace making.
</P>
<P>
In his statement at the opening session, OAU Secretary General
Salim Ahmed Salim said, "the real challenge before us, therefore,
is to ensure that the collective voice of reason and peace is not
drowned by the drums of war, ethnic conflicts and different forms
of intolerance."
</P>
<P>
Salim assessed the current situations in Burundi, Sierra
Leone, Comoros, Somalia and the Republic of Congo, and said,
"Africa cannot shy away from addressing the need to enhance its
capacity to deal with conflict in the continent including
peace-keeping."
</P>
<P>
The opening session was presided by Stan Mudenge, minister of
foreign affairs of Zimbabwe and chairman of this ministerial
session of the central organ. The opening session was followed by
a two-day ministerial meeting in Camera.
</P>
<P>
The Central Organ of the OAU Mechanism for Conflict
Prevention, Management and Resolution was established in 1993 in
Cairo following the first serious deliberation at a summit level
in 1992 in Dakar, Senegal on the need to establish such an organ.

<HEADLINE> Global Rise in Mean Surface Temperature </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Experts attending the '97
China International Environmental Forum warn that failure to limit
greeenhouse gas emissions will raise the global mean surface
temperature by two degrees centigrades over the next 100 years.
</P>
<P>
This will in turn raise the sea level by some 50 cm., according
to Raul Estrada Oyuela, chairman of Ad Hoc Group Berlin Mandate
under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate
Change. He added that many island states will disappear by then.
</P>
<P>
People threatened by storms and floods will be forced to
migrate, and climate changes will aggravate risks of famine and
disease, said Oyuela.
</P>
<P>
He cited a recent report by the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change which noted that stablization of the concentration
of greenhouse gases by the year 2100 will nonetheless be
accompanied by rising temperatures and higher sea levels.

Zou Jingmeng, former chairman of the World Meteorological
Organization, stressed that further proof is needed to verify the
prediction, but noted that people must pay great attention to the
possibility of any increase in the global surface temperature.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the concentration of greenhouse gases, including
carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides, in the atmosphere will
continue to rise due to the use of coal, petroleum, fertilizer and
excessive deforestation.
</P>
<P>
Oyuela said the global mean surface temperature over the past
one hundred years has climbed by 0.6 centigrades, with a rise in
the sea level of between 10-25 centimeters.
</P>
<P>
He said that a 50 cm rise in the sea level will increase the
number of people under the threat of flooding from the current 46
million to 92 million annually.
</P>
<P>
Climate changes will also increase the risk of heart disease,
pulmonary tuberculosis, and other infectious diseases in the
subtropical and tropical areas, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
An international climate conference scheduled for next month in
Kyoto, Japan, will focus on greenhouse gas emissions.

<HEADLINE> First Chinese Top Civil Servant Assumes Office in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The first top Chinese civil
servant assumed office as head of a Macao government department
here today.
</P>
<P>
Fatima Choi, 39, became director of the Macao Census and
Statistics Department, marking the start of a new stage in the
localization of top ranking civil service.
</P>
<P>
Born in Macao and educated in Macao, Hong Kong and Britain,
Choi obtained a master's degree in statistics study. She began
working with the Macao Census and Statistics Department in 1988
and had been head of group, head of sub-division, and
vice-director of department before she assumed the new office.
</P>
<P>
In a ceremony today, she said that the appointment means both
great responsibility, encouragement and trust and that she will
make great efforts to carry out her duty, contributing to Macao's
smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
Although there are several officials at the level of director
of a government office, Choi is the first Chinese to have become
director of a government department.
</P>
<P>
The Macao government promised earlier this year to withdraw all
Portuguese civil servants, mostly holding middle and senior
ranking posts, before the end of next year, therefore making room
for local residents.
</P>
<P>
The localization of top and middle ranking civil servants has
been called a leading and vital issue concerning a stable
transition and a smooth handover of power in Macao, experts said.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Urges Abolishment of Illegal Levies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wu
Bangguo has called for abolishing illegal levies on state-owned
enterprises in order to ease the "heavy burdens" on the national
economy.
</P>
<P>
Improving the economic results of state-owned enterprises has
been and will be conducive to China's campaign to establish a
socialist market economy, and efforts to consolidate the country's
socialist system, according to Wu.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier made the remarks today at a joint government
ministry conference focusing on how to reduce the heavy burden on
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"We must deal seriously with illegal levies on state-owned
enterprises in order maintain social stability and eliminate
corruption amongst officials," said Wu.
</P>
<P>
He said that eliminating levies will be an important step in
meeting the nation's targets for reform the loss-making state
economy and improving the overall economic performance of the
state-owned sector.
</P>
<P>
China hopes to establish a modern enterprise system
encompassing most large and medium-sized enterprises by the end of
this century, and to transform the loss-making sector into
profitable force within three years.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that greater attention must be placed on
reducing illegal levies on state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice-premier also urged government departments to
list and announce illegal levies which will be abolished.
</P>
<P>
The mass media should join in efforts to supervise the related
work of local governments, and nationwide television programs and
teleconferences will be held next year to promote government
efforts to abolish illegal levies.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Unexpected Difficulties for Malaysia's Economy in 1997 (1)  by Wu Dingbao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's economy this
year has been double hit by a turmoil in the financial market and
by an unprecedented haze, resulting in a slowdown.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's real gross domestic product (GDP) growth is expected
to moderate to 8 percent in 1997 against 8.6 percent in 1996,
according to the government's Economic Report 1997/98 released
recently.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, 1997 is the 10th year for Malaysia to achieve
economic growth at a rate of 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the moderation in Malaysia's economic
growth is mainly due to an envisaged slower pace of economic
activities in the second half of the year following the turmoil in
its foreign exchange and stock markets like other regional markets
triggered by the depreciation of the Thai baht in early July, from
which Malaysia has not been spared.
</P>
<P>
Ringgit, the country's currency, has depreciated by more than
30 percent against the U.S. dollar and share prices on the Kuala
Lumpur Stock Exchange have dropped by nearly 50 percent since
then. And both the currency and stock markets are still plunging.
</P>
<P>
The economic situation worsened when Malaysia's tourism, a
promising sector following the depreciation of the local currency,
suffered from the worst ever haze due to forest fires in
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
According to Malaysian Culture, Arts and Tourism Minister
Sabbaruddin Chik, due to the haze which once put Sarawak state in
East Malaysia under an emergency state for 10 days, Malaysia can
not achieve its target of 10 percent increase in tourism revenue
this year as the cancellation rate of hotel rooms reserved by
visitors in East Malaysia is 30 to 40 percent and that in
peninsular Malaysia is as high as 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
The unexpected difficulties confronting the Malaysian economy
this year forced a slowdown of economic activities in almost all
sectors.

<TEXT>
<P>
As the effects of the financial turbulence will be fully felt
next year, performance of the main sectors of the economy has been
satisfactory as envisaged by the government, with the
manufacturing, construction and some sub-sectors in the service
sector continuing to record double-digit expansion.
</P>
<P>
According to the Economic Report, value added in the
manufacturing sector, the backbone of the economy, is envisaged
to increase by 12 percent in real terms against 12.2 percent in
1996 with its share in  real GDP expected to increase to 35.5
percent in the year against that of 34.2 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Though imposition of the limit on bank lending to the broad
property sector in April and the moderation in demand for
properties discourage new construction starts, value added in the
construction sector is expected to grow by 11 percent in 1997 and
the share of the sector in GDP is expected to increase to 4.8
percent from 4.7 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Growth in value added of the service sector is expected to
remain strong, although at a slower rate of 8.7 percent in 1997
against 9.7 percent in 1996, and the share of service sector in
total GDP is estimated to increase to 45 percent against 44.8
percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Output growth of agriculture, forestry, livestock breeding and
fishery is envisaged to pick up to 3.5 percent this year from 2.2
percent in 1996, the report said, adding its share in GDP however
is expected to continue to slide to 12.2 percent in 1997 from 12.7
percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
This year, Malaysia's current account is estimated to record a
slightly larger deficit of 13.1 billion ringgit (3.93 billion U.S.
dollars), compared with 12.3 billion ringgit (3.69 billion
dollars) in 1996, according to the report. But, as a percentage of
GNP, the current account deficit is envisaged to narrow to 5
percent in 1997 against 5.2 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The current account deficit is expected to be adequately
financed by net inflow of foreign corporate direct investment,
amounting to 13.2 billion ringgit (3.96 billion dollars), it
said.
</P>
<P>
It is noteworthy that in 1997, Malaysia has been successful in
keeping inflation at a low level, which eased in the first nine
month to 2.6 percent, the lowest since 1990, against 3.6 percent
in the corresponding period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
For 1997 as a whole, inflation rate is estimated to be around 3
percent as the country replenishes its stocks of supplies for the
remaining months of the year with imports at higher prices from
countries whose currencies have appreciated against the ringgit.

<TEXT>
<P>
Economists say the figures signify that Malaysia's economy is
heading towards a soft landing.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged financial crisis in Southeast Asia will have
significant impact on Malaysia's economy. Therefore, the
government has lowered its projected economic growth to 7 percent
in 1998, and some economists say that the growth rate will be 6 to
6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who is also
finance minister, said, "Our economy is at crossroads. The
direction of the economy is currently fraught with uncertainties.
The crisis in the financial markets, which is being experienced,
is a test of economic resilience and the effectiveness of
policies."
</P>
<P>
In the 1998 Budget presented to Parliament in October, the
finance minister laid out strategies to put the economy back on
track -- strengthening economic fundamentals and stabilizing
financial markets; maintaining sustainable growth; continuing the
process of deregulation and liberalization of the economy; and
continuing the social agenda for further overall development.
</P>
<P>
Taking cognizance of loopholes and weaknesses in the economy,
Anwar announced steps accordingly, including cutting government
expenditure by 3 percent; deferring the implementation of several
mega projects with total investments worth 65.6 billion ringgit
(19.68 billion dollars) and tightening supervision over financial
institutions as well as other measures aimed at reducing the
current account deficit, one of the most worrisome weaknesses;
increasing export competitiveness; and discouraging imports by
increasing import duties for luxury items including cars.
</P>
<P>
It is generally believed that the 1998 Budget has set the tone
for overcoming the short-term problems caused by the speculative
assaults on the region's currencies and stock markets.
</P>
<P>
Local economists and analysts are of the view that Malaysia
will most likely see stability over a medium term based on its
strong fundamentals, which, according to them, have not changed
and will not change if not disturbed.

<HEADLINE> Britain Starts Withdrawing Troops From Northen Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Britain started its first troop
reduction in Northern Ireland today by withdrawing 250 servicemen
from the divided province.
</P>
<P>
This would cut its military presence there to 16,000 soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The first contingent of the Parachute Regiment is returning to
their Aldershot base in southern England, reports said.
</P>
<P>
The government said the withdrawal is possible because the
ceasefire between the Irish Republican Army and its pro-British
foes has been respected.
</P>
<P>
However, the troops will be put on alert once the situation
there deteriorates, reports said.
</P>
<P>
"The troops will remain available for recall to the province
should the security situation require it," an army statement said.
</P>
<P>
The pro-British unionists in the province complained that the
troop withdrawal is a concession to Irish republicans while
Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam regarded it as a step toward
normality after years of guerrilla conflicts.

<HEADLINE> Clean Business Crucial to Anti-corruption Fight: ICAC Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Maintaining a clean business
environment is crucial to the Independent Commission Against
Corruption's (ICAC) continued success in combating corruption,
ICAC Commissioner Lily Yam said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a business ethics conference organized by the
American Chamber of Commerce in conjunction with the ICAC, Yam
stressed the ICAC's care about business ethics.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is a small and closely knit community. What goes on
in business has a knock-on effect on other aspects of community
life," she said.
</P>
<P>
While business people may be vulnerable to extortion by corrupt
officials, a corrupt business community is just as likely to
whittle away the integrity of the public service, she noted.
</P>
<P>
On the ICAC's part, it has succeeded in encouraging over 1,500
companies to draw up codes of conduct for their staff, which
typically set out the principles and values which govern how a
company conducts its business, and what it expects of its staff.
</P>
<P>
"The next step is for us to persuade these companies to
integrate these values and principles in their decision making
process," she added.
</P>
<P>
She took pride in pointing to the fact that Hong Kong has
evolved into the major international financial and business center
that it is today, partly because of its success in fighting
corruption.
</P>
<P>
"We are firmly committed to this task (of keeping corruption

LAGOS, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian head of state, General
Sani Abacha pledged Thursday that his country will host the 1999
10th World Youth Soccer Championship successfully.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading U.S. Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton warily welcomed Saddam Hussein's
decision to back down and allow inspectors to resume their search
for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Arab leaders expressed
relief over the agreement that appears to have averted the threat
of a military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
-- The militant Islamic Group, which has claimed responsibility
for the attack that killed 58 foreign tourists in Luxor, taunted
the Egyptian Government, which it has said was its real target.
The organization said it might be willing to halt its military
operations, but only if the Government took certain steps.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- The United Nations Thursday night told its weapons
inspectors to return to Iraq on Friday after Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein apparently ended his defiance of the world body and
averted a possible military confrontation with the United States
by reversing a ban on American members of the inspection team.
</P>
<P>
-- South Korean has become the latest and largest country in
East Asia to surrender to the financial crisis sweeping the
region and seek an international bailout. The rescue package
could be the biggest in history, economists said.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- proposed health-care protections were accepted by Clinton,
who urged the medical industry to adopt an advisory commission's
report and said Congress should pass legislation to ensure all
consumers are covered. Republican leaders immediately accused the
president of trying to revive his failed health-care plan.
</P>
<P>
-- AIDS researchers believe they have found why some people
infected with the virus never develop the full-blown disease. A
Massachusetts study in today's Science found some people have
unusually high levels of helper T-cells that specifically target
the virus, suggesting very early intervention to protect such
cells could help.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, November 21 (Xinhua) -- A new Golden League including
six elite meetings will be introduced next season, International
Amateur Athletic Federation president Primo Nebiolo announced in
Monte Carlo Friday.
</P>
<P>
Nebiolo said the Golden League would include the most
successful of the existing Grand Prix meetings: Berlin, Brussels,
Monte Carlo, Oslo, Rome and Zurich. The Paris meeting might also
be included if it can match the prize money being offered.
</P>
<P>
The Golden League will have a jackpot of one million dollars to
be divided equally amongst all athletes winning his or her Golden
League events and the Grand Prix final.
</P>
<P>
In the absence of a jackpot winner, the prize of the overall
Grand Prix will be allocated under the existing structure of
200,000 dollars for first place, 100,000 dollars for second,
50,000 dollars for third.
</P>
<P>
World record breakers in the Golden League events will receive
a bonus of 50,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Nebiolo said the IAAF wanted prize money to be a bigger
incentive than appearance fees, however, the world's best
athletes would be offered special promotional agreements to
encourage them to compete in the Golden League.
</P>
<P>
The new series should be sanctioned by the IAAF Council this
weekend.
</P>
<P>
The League replaces the Golden Four meetings at Zurich,
Cologne, Brussels and Berlin which invariably drew the best
fields and put up a 20kg gold ingot divided between competitors
who won their specialty event.

<HEADLINE> More Taiwan-Funded Projects in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The number of Taiwan-funded
projects in Shanghai, China's largest industrial center, topped
3,000 by the end of July, according to a local official in charge
of Taiwan affairs.
</P>
<P>
The projects, with a contracted value of three billion
U.S. dollars, accounted for 12.5 percent of the total value of
foreign-funded project in Shanghai, according to Qiu Changgen,
deputy secretary-general of the Shanghai Municipal Society of
Taiwan Affairs. Qiu made the remarks during the recent Fourth
Shanghai-Taiwan Seminar.
</P>
<P>
The influx of Taiwan investments in Shanghai has passed through
three stages: the initial period between 1984-1990 which ended
with the establishment of a mere 108 Taiwan-funded firms; the boom
period from 1991 and 1994 which witnessed the arrival of 2,050
Taiwan firms; and the period of smooth development in place since
1995. Some 70 percent of Taiwan-funded projects are small
industrial enterprises in various sectors.

<HEADLINE> Rule of Law Central to HK's Success: Secretary for Justice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The rule of law is one of
the fundamental elements of Hong Kong's legal system that help to
foster ethical business conduct in Hong Kong, a senior official of
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) of China said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a keynote luncheon speech at a conference of
"Business Ethics in the HKSAR", Elsie Leung Oi-sie, HKSAR's
secretary for justice, said that the rule of law has been central
to Hong Kong's economic and social success.
</P>
<P>
One of the principles of the rule of law is that laws operate
separately from the political system, Leung said.
</P>
<P>
The second principle is that everyone, no matter how high, is
subject to the law, and that a person can only be punished for
conduct that is a breach of the law, she said.
</P>
<P>
The third principle is that of equality before the law: no one
gets better or worse treatment under the law because of his or her
status, wealth, race and so on, Leung said.
</P>
<P>
For the business community in particular, the rule of law is
crucial. Without it, there is no protection against corruption,
nepotism or expropriation.
</P>
<P>
Only under the rule of law are businessmen guaranteed the level
playing field and the competitive environment which they need, she
added.
</P>
<P>
"The independence of the Judiciary is another cornerstone of
our legal system that promotes ethical behavior," Leung said. In
the SAR, judicial independence is secured by provisions in the
Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law stipulates that the courts of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region shall exercise power independently,
free from any interference.
</P>
<P>
During her speech, Leung elaborated some specific areas of the
law that foster ethical business conduct, which include
anti-corruption legislation, control of unfair contract terms, and
anti-discrimination laws.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: South Korea Turns to IMF for Rescue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 21 (Xinhua) -- South Korea, which has been
called a "tiger" for its booming economy, today formally applied
to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a loan of 50 billion
U.S. dollars to bail out its plunging financial market.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean currency won has sharply devaluated since the
beginning of October, breaking the mark of 1,000 against the
dollar and sending the stock price index to the lowest level of
under 500 points since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners have been either withdrawing their investment from
the country or scrambling to convert their holdings into dollars.
</P>
<P>
While political turmoil relating to the December 18
presidential election played a part in worsening the financial
situation, economic recession which started in late 1995 has been
the principal villain.
</P>
<P>
First, the poor management of some large conglomerates has
brought about huge amounts of non-performancing loans and bad
loans. These conglomerates have been given all kinds of privileges
including huge government loans in the country's 40 years of
development and become a dominant player in the economy.
</P>
<P>
Their management characterized by high cost, low efficiency and
blind expansion has made the mostly export-oriented conglomerates
increasingly less competitive in the world market.
</P>
<P>
Several business giants have collapsed under heavy debt burden
since the beginning of this year, seriously weakening foreign
investors' confidence in the economy.
</P>
<P>
Government policy flaws are also to blame. The government has
been controlling the financial market with strict rules. Critics
say the government has put too much emphasis on such numerical
economic indicators as GDP growth rate, export growth rate and
inflation rate, ignoring institutional issues like competition
rules and the efficiency of market structure.
</P>
<P>
Big current account deficit and foreign debt, a price the
country has paid for economic growth, is also a catalyst. The
financial crisis, which started in Thailand and then spread to
other South-east Asian nations, brought a strong negative impact
on South Korea's financial market.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the IMF is certainly a painful decision. It could
mean more business bankruptcies, less economic sovereignty and
high unemployment. But with the presidential election less than a
month away, what else can the incumbent government do to contain
the situation?

<HEADLINE> Most State-Sponsored Overseas Scholars Return on Time (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- China's new practise of
sending scholars abroad for advanced training at state expense has
been successful, with 90 percent scholars returning home on
schedule.
</P>
<P>
"The new method has helped improve both the quality of scholars
and the return rate, " according to Cao Guoxing, secretary-general
of the China Scholarship Council (CSC). Cao made the remarks
during today's annual meeting of the CSC.
</P>
<P>
China has subsidized foreign studies for 1,107 people since
1995 when the nation introduced reform in northeast China's Jilin
Province and east China's Jiangsu Provinces. The CSC was formed in
1996 to administer related affairs on behalf of the State
Education Commission.
</P>
<P>
The reform effort has allowed individuals to apply for state
subsidies for studies and research outside China. Experts review
applications, with a panel of at least five experts rendering
final approval.
</P>
<P>
Individuals approved for foreign studies or research sign
contracts with the CSC and deposit a specified amount of earnest
money in designated banks prior to going abroad.
</P>
<P>
Scholars returning on time can claim the earnest money and
accumulated interest. Those failing to fulfill contract
commitments are subject to fines.
</P>
<P>
The new system is the first in Chinese history requiring
scholars receiving state subsidies to sign a legally binding
contract prior to going abroad.
</P>
<P>
"Contracts has altered the situation under which the state or
sponsor lacked a binding agreement with people receiving
subsidies," said Cao.
</P>
<P>
The CSC has adjudicated a number of cases involving contract
violations, and in so doing has guaranteed administrative
supervision over the efficient use of state funds.

BANGKOK, November 21 (Xinhua) -- World Boxing Federation (WBF)
junior bantamweight champion Samson Dutchboygym of Thailand
retained his title with a technical knockout victory over South
Korea's Jin Young Yung in Sukhothai, Thailand, on Friday.

Samson, 25, dominated the fight with left hooks to the body and
 left and right hooks to the face.
</P>
<P>

<P>
The CSC has adopted procedures enabling returned scholars to
apply for research funds. The system is designed to serve the
country and ensure that scholars return on time.
</P>
<P>
CSC members attending today's meeting proposed that the
organization provide additional funds for state-sponsored overseas
scholars and establish a reasonable scholarship system.
</P>
<P>
CSC members also discussed issues related to sending more
scholars abroad for advanced studies without requesting additional
government funding.
</P>
<P>
The CSC has attempted to solve related issues by cooperating
with local governments. Agreements reached between the CSC and
local governments in June yielded three million yuan (360,000 US
dollars) in funding to sponsor scholars for overseas study and
academic exchange programs.
</P>
<P>
North China's Hebei and northeast China's Liaoning provinces
have pledged to pay half the expenses of scholars engaged in
overseas programs. The agreements have effectively relieved the
CSC of burdens related to paying the full amount.
</P>
<P>
The CSC announced that it will initiate a program sponsoring
Chinese students seeking master's degrees abroad. The organization
has also reduced the time limit for senior visiting scholars to
remain overseas from 12 months to 3-6 months.
</P>
<P>
The CSC will also relax age limits for applicants in order to
provide outstanding students with an opportunity to study abroad.
</P>
<P>
The CSC will improve administrative efficiency by establishing
links with the Internet in order to provide direct links with
foreign scholars.
</P>
<P>
The CSC is currently drafting plans to send scholars abroad in
1998. Informed sources note that the number of applicants approved
will remain at the 1997 level.

<P>
JERUSALEM, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli security forces
today arrested a number of suspects in the East Jerusalem area,
who were in connection with Wednesday's shooting attack on Jewish
students in Jerusalem's Old City.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police believed that the suspects belong to a local
gang of terrorists who received help from residents of the
Muslim quarter in the Old City.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a temporary police post has been set up beside the
Jewish religious school in the Old City and police personnel in
the area have been increased to provide protection for the
Jewish residents.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday described
the attack, in which a Jewish student was killed and another was
seriously wounded, as an unprecedented act of terrorism that was
"intolerable" and must not go unpunished.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu noted that the assailants used Kalashnikov automatic
rifles, stressing that this was a grave escalation in the type
of weaponry used by terrorists operating in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
On the Palestinian side, Hisham Abdul Razik, a Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) official in the joint
Israeli-Palestinian security committee, Thursday condemned the
shooting, saying that "all acts of violence hurt the peace
process and have negative effects."
</P>
<P>
PNA security sources said that Netanyahu's hardline policy in
the peace process should be blamed for the shooting.

<P>
TOKYO, December 21 (Xinhua) -- European champions Russia
overpowered out-formed Olympic and world champions Cuba to
continue their winning streak through four rounds at the women's
competition of the world volleyball grand champions cup tournament
here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The showdown between the two favorites, both unbeaten in their
first three actions, turned into an one-side game as Russia's
young talent Evguenia Artamonova smashed all the way to power her
team to 15-9, 13-15, 15-6, 15-9 over Cuba in one hour and 31
minutes.
</P>
<P>
With a 4-0 record, the Russians has virtually gained the title
of the six-team event even if they lose their last match to South
Korea on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
South Korea suffered its fourth setback in as many outings
after going down to Asian champions China 15-6, 12-15, 15-9 on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, trailing 10-1 in the second set, fought bravely to
narrow the gap to 13-10, before the game heading to rally-point
system under the new rule of the 25-minute time limitation.
</P>
<P>
Both sides went steadily on their chances of scoring, and
China's top spiker Sun Yue leaped to the net and sealed the set
with her over-blocking samsh.
</P>
<P>
"Entirely, we played well but our attacking combination didn't
work well on the half way of the second set." Chinese head coach
Lang Ping said at a post-press conference.
</P>
<P>
"We lost to China 3-0 few months ago at the Asian Championship
and so did we today. We are in our worst condition caused by
losing key players and injuries to others," said Kim Hyung-sil,
 head coach of the winless South Korea.
</P>

<HEADLINE> "Seven Years in Tibet" Is Not A Good Movie (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Though I'm not an expert on Tibet, I can see easily that
the 'Tibet' in this movie is not the real Tibet," Tobari said,
adding that the movie has depicted the Chinese People's Liberation
Army (PLA) as a barbaric army, and that an arrogant and disgusting
"PLA officer" in the movie even bears a physical resemblance to
Chairman Mao Zedong.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think that the Chinese people would be pleased to see
this," he said.
</P>
<P>
In Tobari's opinion, "Seven Years in Tibet" intended to tell a
story about the friendship between the Dalai Lama, then an
innocent and inquisitive young man eager to be better informed
about the outside world, and an arrogant and heartless Austrian
mountaineer regaining his loving and compassionate nature by
communicating with the Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
"It's a pity that the movie failed to develop this major
theme. On the contrary, it got involved in political warfare and
tried to divert the theme to 'the PLA's suppression in Tibet',"
said Tobari.
</P>
<P>
He told the Hong Kong Economic Journal that he believes the
film festival organizers should have tried to get a better
understanding of Tibet's situation before deciding to accept a
movie like "Seven Years in Tibet."
</P>
<P>
In a note at the end, the editor pointed out that shortly after
the completion of the movie, the author of the book on which the
movie was loosely based, was discovered to be a former Nazi.

<HEADLINE> "Seven Years in Tibet" Is Not A Good Movie (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The recently released American
movie "Seven Years in Tibet" is a poorly-made movie with a
fabricated historical background that seriously vilifies the
Oriental people, according to a movie review in the Hong Kong
Economic Journal's November 12 issue.
</P>
<P>
It said that China has been forced to boycott this year's Tokyo
International Film Festival because the Japanese organizers
insisted on showing this Hollywood movie at the closing ceremony
and that this can be said to be some kind of "political conflict"
and "diplomatic incident."
</P>
<P>
The reviewer based this mainly on an interview with Tobari
Higashiyu, a noted movie critic in Japan who watched "Seven Years
in Tibet" on October 29.
</P>
<P>
"The deepest impression I got from this movie is that both the
characters and background of the story are untrue, and that the
movie is a vilification of the Oriental peoples by the Americans,"
Tobari was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
From an artistic perspective, he said, "Seven Years in Tibet"
is by no means good and doesn't deserve such a warm reception from
the film festival organizers.
</P>
<P>
"As I know, this movie wasn't shot in Tibet, but on a snow
mountain somewhere in South America, and the Potala Palace in it
was just a model," he said, adding that all major actors, except
one Japanese-American, are Americans.

160 million yuan in the bridge, which is expected to become
operational in May of next year.
</P>
<P>
The Yellow river divides Lanzhou's urban area into two
parts. The northern portion has become a hot spot for economic and
technological development.

He noted that housing conditions represent one of the
substantial benefits a teacher should gain from hard work. Li
added that local governments should provide greater assistance for
university housing projects.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier also watched demonstrations of a customs
inspection system for containerized goods and a televised

<HEADLINE> Japan Marks 25th Anniversary of Okinawa's Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government held a
ceremony in Okinawa today to mark the 25th anniversary of the
return of the island prefecture to Japan from the United States,
according to a Kyodo News report.
</P>
<P>
Some 700 dignitaries, including Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto, attended the commemorative ceremony at the Okinawa
convention Center in the City of Ginowan, report reaching here
said.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony was held on the date when the United States and
Japan issued a joint statement in 1969 announcing an end to
U.S. occupation.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa was officially returned to Japan on May 15, 1972 after
27 years of the U.S. occupation since the end of World War II.
</P>
<P>
Japan failed to hold the commemorative ceremony in May because
of the dispute between Okinawa Prefecture and the central
government over the continued land use for U.S. military
facilities in the southernmost island prefecture.
</P>
<P>
But the government-sponsored ceremony today failed to create a
festive mood because major local political parties and civic
groups were boycotting the event to draw attention to Okinawa's
sluggish economy and the heavy U.S. presence.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa, accounting for only 0.6 percent of Japan's total area,
houses about 75 percent of U.S. military presence in Japan.

between Indonesia and South Africa has grown to 258 million U.S.
Ddollars with the balance in South Africa's favor, the report said.

visit to South Africa, bilateral agreements on trade and aviation were

<HEADLINE> China to Increase Afforestation Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- A Ministry of Forestry
official attending today's session of the ongoing international
environmental conference said that China will raise its
afforestation rate from less than 14 to over 20 percent in 13
years.
</P>
<P>
The country will also have less biological degradation by year
2010 due to programs controlling soil erosion and desertification,
according to Li Yucai, vice-minister of Forestry.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks during today's closing session of the '97
China Environmental Forum.
</P>
<P>
China has increased its forestry coverage by some six percent
from the eight percent coverage level 45 years ago, according to
Li.
</P>
<P>
"The country will reach its goal by maintaining the current
rate of afforestation and deforestation," said Li Shidong, a
ministry official in the afforestation program.
</P>
<P>
China has 134 million hectares of forests, representing a total
of 11.8 billion cubic meters of timber, according to Li. The per
capita level of timber is only one-sixth of the worldwide
average. However, the country plants trees on 8.8 million hectares
of land or hills annually.
</P>
<P>
Li Yucai noted that relevant departments are drafting national
environmental protection programs focusing on the Yangtze and
Yellow river valleys and the loess plateau. The forestry ministry
will introduce six new afforestation projects to areas in the
aforementioned river valleys over 12 months.
</P>
<P>
The government also plans to increase the coverage of nature
reserves from the current 6.37 percent to 8.33 percent of the
nation's total territory in order to protect wildlife and
endangered species, according to the official.

DAR ES SALAAM, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's Deputy

<P>
BAGHDAD, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations' 77 arms
inspectors, including the expelled Americans, returned to Iraq
today, ending a three-week standoff between Iraq and the U.N..
</P>
<P>
U.N. sources, who asked not to be named, said the inspectors
arrived at Iraq's Habaniya military air base, about 120 kilometers
west of the capital Baghdad, from Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to resume inspection on Iraq's weapons
systems Saturday, the sources added.
</P>

The inspectors pulled out of Iraq on November 14 after Iraq
expelled the six Americans in the U.N. inspection teams a day

proposal Thursday to allow the inspectors to be back.
</P>
<P>
The inspectors working for the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM)

The U.N. Security Council will not lift the crippling sanctions
it imposed on Iraq since 1990 until the commission has verified

<HEADLINE> Developed Nations Should Reduce Greenhouse Gas Emissions, Experts Say (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Developed countries,
which are the biggest source of global greenhouse gas, should
be responsible for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, according to
scientists at the '97 China Environmental Forum in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
R. Estrada Oyuela, Chairman of the Ad Hoc Group Berlin Mandate
of UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, said that
developed nations should take the lead in global efforts to cut
greenhouse gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
Greenhouse gas emissions in developing countries are much lower
than in developed countries and countries with economies in
transition, in both absolute and per-capita terms, according to
Robert T. Watson, chairman of the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) and director of the World Bank's Environment
Department.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 64 percent of the global greenhouse gas was emitted
by developed countries, which account for only 25 percent of the
world's population.
</P>
<P>
What is more, Watson pointed out, developed countries have a
much greater economic, technological and institutional capability
to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
"We must all recognize that, in the near-term, developing
countries need to increase their production and consumption of
energy to alleviate poverty and under-development," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zou Jingmeng, former head of the World Meteorological
Organization, said that, although dealing with greenhouse gas
is a common responsibility, developed countries should do more in
this regard.
</P>
<P>
Zou urged developed countries to fulfill their commitments in
accordance with the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change.
</P>
<P>
At the UN Conference on Environment and Development in 1992,
developed countries were called on to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions to the 1990 level by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
However, judged by current trends, greenhouse gas emissions in
developed countries still fall short of the standard, according to
Dr. Suvit Yodmani, director and regional representative of the UN
Environment Program for Asia and the Pacific.

He added that more financial and technical assistance
should be provided to developing countries to help them control
greenhouse gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
In December, leaders of various countries will meet in Japan to
discuss climate changes, and an agreement on the reduction of
greenhouse gas emissions is expected to be reached then.
</P>
<P>
Japan and the European Union recently said that they would cut
greenhouse gas emissons 2.5 and 15 percent respectively by the
year 2010.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang Zhijia, director of the International
Co-operation Department of the State Bureau of Environmental
Protection, China has made great efforts in the past decade in
improving energy utilization, restructuring energy consumption,
developing new clean energy, afforestation and population control.
</P>
<P>
"Actually we have made great contributions to the global
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions," Wang said.

HONG KONG, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong today put into
effect a new law to protect such persons as single parents, who
are discriminated against in employment because of their family
status.
</P>
<P>
The Family Status Discrimination Ordinance (FSDO) also ensures
that such persons who have the responsibility to take care of
their family members would not be discriminated against in
education, provision of goods, facilities and services, disposal
and management of premises and activities of government.

<P>
The new law is the third ordinance in Hong Kong to guarantee

A government spokesman said today that aggrieved persons may
seek the assistance of the Equal Opportunities Commission, which
handles complaints, conducts investigations and settles disputes.

<P>
HONG KONG, November 21 (Xinhua) -- All the nine Yaohan
department stores in Hong Kong closed today because the troubled
Japanese chain retailer failed to pay its debts.
</P>
<P>
The shutdown would throw 2,700 staff out of work, the
largest-scale layoff in Hong Kong's retail industry.
</P>
<P>
Yaohan Hong Kong Corporation Ltd announced Thursday that its
wholly-owned subsidiary, Yaohan Department Store (HK), had applied
to the High Court of Hong Kong for its winding up because it could
not pay its debts. There were nine Yaohan department stores in
Hong Kong and one in Macao, all closed today.
</P>
<P>
Three people from the accounting firm Ernst &AMP; Young had been
appointed as provisional liquidators, said Yaohan, owned by the
Japanese Wada family.
</P>
<P>
The retailer giant moved its headquarters from Japan to Hong
Kong in 1990 to expand its business in Hong Kong, Macao and the

HONG KONG, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong share prices
rebounded nearly 500 points today to end the volatile week at
10,548.20 following the overnight surge in Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The jump recouped all the lost ground over the past three days,
when the key Hang Seng Index took an accumulative loss of 369

The Dow-Jones 500 Industrial Index rose sharply to surpass
7,800 points last night, triggering a higher open on the Hong Kong

</P>
<P>
Easing interest rates on the local money market turned out to
be another engine of today's recovery, in which the blue-chip
index went up 497.52 points, or 4.95 percent. The primary
three-month interbank lending rates came down to around ten
percent, creating encouraging sentiment in the market.
</P>
<P>
Bank counters led the rebound today by rocketing more than 700

and industry shares all posted considerable gains of four to five
percent. Red chips rose slightly but H shares edged lower.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania May Have Independent Graft Prosecutor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian
government is considering the possibility of appointing an
independent prosecutor to try cases related to corruption in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference in Dar es Salaam Thursday,
President Benjamin Mkapa said he has not decided on the matter
but he was seriously thinking about it.
</P>
<P>
"The use of an independent prosecutor to try corruption cases
is one of the issues currently lying on my desk. We have not
decided on it, but certainly we are taking it seriously and
thinking on the possibility of adopting it," he was quoted by The
Guardian as saying.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutor is to operate under the Prevention of
Corruption Bureau. The bureau, which would reclaim powers of
arrest, search and detention under recent amendments to the law,
is currently responsible for the investigation of the corruption
cases, but it must wait for the authority from the Director of
Public Prosecutors (DPP) to try the suspects.
</P>
<P>
Appointment of a special prosecutor independent of the DPP is
that it would overcome the apparent delay in clearing the cases
in hand for prosecution, and the possibility of some of them
being suppressed, Daily News said.
</P>
<P>
President Mkapa reiterated his commitment to fight corruption,
but asked for a wider support to accomplish the mission.
</P>
<P>
"Let them (corrupt officials) rest assured that they have no
sanctuary at all," he warned. "Once we've evidence about their
involvement in corruption we will immediately take them to task."
</P>
<P>
The president also assured that he keeps telling members of
the Cabinet to be transparent and honest when conducting
government business.
</P>
<P>
He said he has not completed his crusade to bring changes in
the government. He did not elaborate but insisted that he was not
through.
</P>
<P>
"Let us wait and see what is going to happen in the next few
weeks," Mkapa said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- China's departments of

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Quickened Economic Reform Envisaged in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government has put
a final touch to preparations for beefing up economic reforms in
the coming year when presidential election will be held for the
first time in five years.
</P>
<P>
The Fourth Nigerian Economic Summit ended in the capital Abuja
Thursday with participants faulting the 1997 budget to be
"structurally defective" and recommending a wide range of reforms
next year.
</P>
<P>
The annual meeting attended by senior government officials,
economists, industrialists, experts and scholars, among others,
is a forum before the government finalizes its fiscal budget.
</P>
<P>
In a 49-page summary of discussions at the summit, the
participants noted that the 1997 budget relied heavily on the
public sector to jump-start the economy instead of the private
sector.
</P>
<P>
Among the wide range of reforms recommended are the proposals
on education, health and population put forward to by the Vision
2010, the country's first long-term socio-economic development
blueprint no waiting for the "Go ahead" instruction from the head
of state.
</P>
<P>
These reforms should be integrated into the 1998 budget,
participants said.
</P>
<P>
The summit document rated government low on the implementation
of this year's budget, pointing at delayed capital spending by
government and excess liquidity at the beginning of the year,
followed by too much fiscal tightening later in the year as part
of its defects.
</P>
<P>
Head of State General Sani Abacha, at the opening of the
summit Wednesday, also admitted that the economy did not perform
as expected in 1997 as for increasing more jobs was concerned.
</P>
<P>
The government effort to build up a healthy economy this year
has resulted in comparatively stable macroeconomic stability
characterized by diving inflation rate, increasing foreign
exchange reserves, falling foreign debt stocks and stable
exchange rate of the local currency to hard currencies.
</P>
<P>
However, lack of development of infrastructure facilities has
contributed to the poor performance of the manufacturing sector
so that most industrial products have to be imported to meet
domestic need.
</P>
<P>
The expensive imported goods plus the poor pay of public
sector employees and high unemployment have resulted in low
purchasing power and subsequently low consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
Very little tax/tariff reforms, lack of bold steps to further
liberalize/deregulate the economy, non abrogation of laws
inhibiting competition are all factors to the sluggishness of the
economy this year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, according to statistics, about 70 percent of the
country's private wealth which could have given a boost to
domestic economic growth is being kept abroad.
</P>
<P>
Observers noted how to persuade the owners of the wealth, the sum
of which is unknown but believed to be very big, will remain an
important job of the government.
</P>
<P>
Although he was not happy with the private sector which has
not been active enough to invest, Abacha said his administration
will try to ensure that private investment will be worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
To achieve improvement next year, Abacha has promised that the
government will work towards providing enabling environment from
1998 and in subsequent years for the manufacturing industry to
rise up to the challenges of developing Nigeria's abundant
domestic resources and providing employment for the teeming
population.
</P>
<P>
As presidential election is drawing near, Abacha, whether he
is to contest or not, is sure to take some measures to better the
economy and the people's daily life.
</P>
<P>
It is the only way to keep the situation stable for such an
extraordinarily important year in the history of the country.
</P>
<P>
Abacha has stated his government is committed to the speedy
and faithful implementation of the recommendations of the Vision
2010 Committee into the 1988 budget in order to accelerate
economic growth and long-term development of the country.
</P>
<P>
This might be a good thing and the people are waiting to see
what economic measures the government is to take in the new
budget which is expected to be announced before the end of this
year.

Nigeria's head of state, General Sani Abacha announced Monday
in a national broadcast marking his four years in power that the

quite determined to release all the detainees, and will give
Nigerians a surprise.
</P>
<P>

canvassed in the past are M.K.O. Abiola, the millionaire
politician who has been in jail since 1994; former head of state
Olusegun Obasanjo, jailed for his role in a failed coup in 1995

<HEADLINE> India's UF Rejects Congress Demand to Sack DMK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The 14-party United Front
(UF) today rejected the Congress demand to oust three ministers of
Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), one of the constituents of the
UF, from the Gujral government.
</P>
<P>
The core committee of the UF held a meeting at the residence of
Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral here this morning to discuss a
letter given to Gujral by Congress President Sitaram Kesri last
night, who asked the prime minister to choose between DMK and the
Congress.
</P>
<P>
The letter said that the Congress cannot continue to extend its
support to the UF government if the DMK continues to be a
constituent of the government.
</P>
<P>
A report presented to Parliament by the Jain Commission said
that the DMK was linked with the assassination of former prime
minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991.
</P>
<P>
"It does not matter whether the government stays or goes, but
the DMK will stay," said a UF leader.
</P>
<P>
Former prime minister Deve Gowda today also said that whether
there were general elections or not, there was no question of
dumping the DMK from the government.
</P>
<P>
Congress President Kesri today declined to comment on the UF's
decision to reject his party's demand for sacking the three
ministers of the DMK from the UF government.
</P>
<P>
He said that he could react only after he was formally informed
by the front of its decision.
</P>
<P>
Congress senior leader in the Lower House of Parliament Sharad
Pawar said today that his party was prepared to face polls in the
event of the fall of the UF government.
</P>
<P>
The UF core committee is expected to meet here again this
evening to further discuss the present situation in the country.

<HEADLINE> 20 Killed in Kenya's Tribal Clashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Month-long clashes between
the Luo, Kisii, Kuria and Maasai tribes in Nyanza Province,
south-western Kenya, have left more than 20 people dead, charred
villages and caused a public panic.
</P>
<P>
At least 10 people from the Kisii community were hacked to
death in Kilgoris town, Trans Mara District Thursday, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
When word about the killings reached Gucha-Trans Mara border,
the Kisiis armed themselves with bows and arrows and proceeded to
Maasailand at Nyangusu where they seriously injured a number of
Maasais.
</P>
<P>
Rumors and leaflets warning "foreigners" were rampant in the
area where insecurity among local residents has been raging on as
brutal retaliation between different tribes appears to become
daily fare.
</P>
<P>
The root causes of the conflicts remain mysterious and have
been explained with matters ranging from buying and selling of
land, cattle rustling and the coming general elections.
</P>
<P>
Kisii District Commissioner Wilson Litole said the Thursday's
attack was aimed at scaring the Kisiis from participating in the
ruling KANU party nominations exercise which will be held next
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Across the border, pastoralist Maasai and Kurias have a
tradition of cattle rustling from each other and from Kisiis, who
in turn, have retaliated, leading to volatile relations between
the three tribes.
</P>
<P>
However, Luos and Maasais have lived in relative harmony since
a Migori-Transmara cross-border agreement three years ago. When
fighting erupted in Migori this time, Maasais joined Luos to
battle against Kisiis.

<HEADLINE> Arrhythmia Causes Sudden Death of Young </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- An expert on cardiology has
said that 90 percent of the sudden death of people aged at 30-35
are caused by heart problems resulting from arrhythmia.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Cyprus Weekly published today, Antonio
Bayes de Luna, head of the International Society and Federation of
Cardiology, said that arrhythmia causes ventricular fibrillation,
and is usually brought on by the overgrowth of the ventrical
cavity which is usually a genetic disease.
</P>
<P>
De Luna is here to attend the three-day 16th international
cardiology conference due to be held today, at which he will
address difficult cases of arrhythmia.
</P>
<P>
He said that the coronary heart disease is the other major
killer of people at that age, which is caused by high cholesterol
levels, smoking and hypertension, and appears early in life.
</P>
<P>
This, too, may be affected by a genetic factor, he added.
</P>
<P>
Every year, there are 5-6 million people in the world dying
of heart diseases, according to De Luna.
</P>
<P>
He noted that heart-related diseases have been reduced in
developed countries due to preventive methods and also healthy
lifestyles, but they are on the rise in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
While rheumatic heart disease is still very common in
developing countries, it is effectively controlled with penicillin
in the developed world, he said.

<HEADLINE> South Korea to Seek IMF Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government
Friday said that it has decided to seek rescue loans from the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) to lift itself out of a worst
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference later in the day, new Deputy Prime
Minister and Finance and Economy Minister Lim Chang-yuel confirmed
the decision but made it clear that formal loan request has yet to
be made.
</P>
<P>
"The government will make the final announcement on whether
Seoul will obtain an IMF loan or not in two to three days," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The tentative decision to resort to the IMF was reached after
talks between Minister Lim and IMF Vice President Stanley Fischer
in Seoul Friday.
</P>
<P>
The government has tried to secure loans from the central banks
of the United States and Japan, but failed to do so because they
said they would not extend loans unless Seoul first accepts IMF
bailout money.
</P>
<P>
The government Wednesday unveiled a desperate last-ditch
financial stabilization package. But it failed to prevent the
country from sliding further into financial turmoil. This may have
prompted the government to seek an IMF rescue money to bail out
the foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
The IMF's infusion of emergency bailout money into South Korea,
if implemented as planned, will surely result in a loss of
economic sovereignty and seismic upheavals of the national
economy, industry experts say.
</P>
<P>
"With the national economy managed by the IMF, the South Korean
people will have to endure all kinds of economic hardships,
including massive layoffs, freezing of wages, higher tax rates,
higher interest rates and extremely low GDP growth, among others,"
said a Seoul economist.
</P>
<P>
"Restructuring and M&AMP;As particularly among financial
institutions and automakers, opening of the local financial
market, and reforming the conglomerates-dominated economy will
also further accelerate, regardless of the intent of the
government and business communities," he asserted.
</P>
<P>
The IMF is expected to press South Korea for wider opening of
the financial market, mergers of less competitive financial
institutions and the automobile industry's restructuring as a
condition for extending a rescue package.
</P>
<P>
Despite the widespread pessimism, however, some experts raised
optimistic views, saying that the IMF rescue will help Seoul to
hasten the settlement of a set of previously thorny issues, such
as conglomerates' economic dominance, inflexibility in labor
market and financial-sector reforms.

PARIS, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The congress of the French Socialist Party will open today in
Brest, a port city in western France, at a time when Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin wins 61 percent of approval from the French
public opinion. Francois Hollande, a close associate of Jospin, is
also expected to replace him as the party leader at the congress.
</P>
<P>
-- French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine said that the success
in defusing the crisis between Iraq and the international
community is mainly due to the efficiency and unity of the five
permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. He also
said that the United States has made a major concession by
agreeing to expand the formula of "oil for food" program for Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The first European extraordinary summit on jobs opened
Thursday in Luxemburg while 30,000 people demonstrated in the
streets of the Grand Duchy at the call of the European
Confederation of Trade Unions, urging "concrete measures" instead
of a wave of promises.
</P>
<P>
The 15 members of European Union will adopt today direction lines
to fight the scourge of unemployment, which is affecting 18 million
people in EU countries.
</P>
<P>
France, who initiated the summit, calls for a maximum precision
in the objectives of the fight against unemployment while Germany
estimates that promises which are too precise can only create
disillusion.
</P>
<P>
-- Despite the agreement by Saddam Hussein to let all UNSCOM
members return to Iraq, the United States maintains pressure on
Baghdad by continuing to reinforce military presence in the
Gulf. Washington also said it would use its right of veto to
prevent the United Nations from lifting its sanctions against
Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Take Measures to Keep Economy Growing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government is
planning a series of measures to ensure further economic growth
next year, Prime Minister Phan Van Khai said here today.
</P>
<P>
The measures include improving efficiency and competitiveness
among industries, developing agriculture toward industrialization
and modernization, and speeding up reforms at state enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Phan Van Khai announced the planned new measures in his report
on the work of the government delivered at the second session of
the 10th National Assembly, or legislature, which opened today.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese economy has maintained the momentum of growth so
far this year but difficulties have emerged in keeping the pace
and sustainability of the growth, the prime minister noted.
</P>
<P>
The National Assembly's growth targets for this year's gross
domestic product (GDP), agricultural production, grain yields,
inflation and population expansion can be reached, he said.
</P>
<P>
A GDP growth of 9 percent is expected this year.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, growth rates for industrial production,
service sales and export turnover, estimated at 13, 9.5 and 20
percent respectively, will fall short of the targets.
</P>
<P>
During its current session, scheduled to last through December
10, the National Assembly will hear the government's plan on
economic and social progress for 1998, and its budget proposal.
</P>
<P>
Also on the review list of the legislature are priority
construction projects planned to be carried out over the next few
years, and the country's proposed Bank Law and some other bills.

<HEADLINE> 3,000 Residents Flee Conflict in Southern Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- About 3,000 residents fled
their homes in North Cotabato province in the southern Philippines
due to tensions brought about by a series of skirmishes between
members of two Muslim groups.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine News Agency today reported that people abandoned
their homes for fear that they might be caught up in an impending
war between the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) and the Moro
Islamic Liberation Front (MILF).
</P>
<P>
The MILF is a breakaway faction of the mainstream MNLF which
signed a final peace agreement with the government in September
1996. The MILF, dissatisfied with the peace deal, demanded
separate peace talks and has signed a comprehensive ceasefire
agreement with Manila.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said some MNLF fighters killed in an ambush
three MILF rebels on their way to a feast near Pikit town on
November 16. In retaliation, the MILF staged an attack on an
MNLF-run village the next day, killing one MNLF member.
</P>
<P>
Government troops based in the nearby area took steps to stop
the conflict, using mortars to drive the MILF rebels away.
</P>
<P>
The evacuees are reportedly living with relatives in nearby
towns. They have appealed to government officials to look into
their problem.

<HEADLINE> Germany's Trade Surplus Surges to Nearly $54 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Germany's trade surplus surged to
93.9 billion marks (54 billion U.S. dollars) in the first nine
months of this year after another strong export showing in
September, the German Federal Statistics Office announced today.
</P>
<P>
The figures released today by the Wiesbaden-based office show
that Germany's exports continue its robust growth by expanding
23.1 percent over the level of a year ago to 78.5 billion marks
(45.1 billion dollars) in September.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imports also increased by 15.2 percent to 63.7
billion marks (36.6 billion dollars), so that the country's
September trade surplus was 14.8 billion marks (8.5 billion
dollars) compared with 8.5 billion marks (4.9 billion dollars) a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
Taking the first nine months of 1997 as a whole, the country's
exports totalled 647.2 billion marks (372 billion dollars) against
an import total of 553 billion marks (318 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the country's current account balance, which also
includes trade in services, still registered a deficit of 7.5
billion marks (4.3 billion dollars) in the first nine months.

Home Secretary Jack Straw Thursday to relieve pressure on
overcrowded jails.
</P>
<P>
The Financial Times:

<HEADLINE> Most Silicone Breast Implants Will Leak, Scientists Warn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have found almost
all silicone breast implants will rupture and leak after 20 years,
a medical magazine here reported today.
</P>
<P>
A summary of research studies in The Lancet says only five
percent of women can expect to have both implants intact after 20
years, only 51 percent after 12 years and 89 percent after eight
years.
</P>
<P>
The study was conducted on 592 implants which had been in place
for between one and 25 years. It recommended that implants be
removed after eight years. Mechanical testing of implants
confirmed that they become weaker as they age.
</P>
<P>
Researchers from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration say both
"the incidence and prevalence of breast implant rupture are much
higher than previously expected and the risk of rupture increases
as the implant ages."
</P>
<P>
Few of the ruptures were caused by obvious injury or
damage. Manufacturers of breast implants put rates of rupture at
0.2 to 1.1 percent although the U.S. government agency has
received higher estimates from other researchers.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 21 (Xinhua) -- South African
Deputy-President Thabo Mbeki is due to visit Britain early next
Tuesday to solidify already strong diplomatic and trade
relations.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Business Day quoted diplomatic sources as
reporting today that Mbeki, who will be accompanied by Trade and
Industry Minister Alec Erwin, is due to meet Queen Elizabeth,
Primie Minister Tony Blair and Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
during his visit.
</P>
<P>
The sources said a British bid to supply all of South Africa's
new defense procurement needs will be high on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
This bid takes place in a highly competitive environment with
Germany, France, Spain, and Sweden among the European countries
also interested in selling arms to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The South African National Defense Force and defense ministry
are on record as having indicated that South Africa's procurement
needs include corvettes, tanks and aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The cost estimates have ranged from between two and three
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The importance of the current proposals is enhanced because of
suggestions about the establishment of an African peacekeeping
intervention force.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is likely to be an important part of such a
force. Local observers said that any country which arms South
Africa would be likely to gain influence in this body because of
the need for weapons and command standardization.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Banks Warned Against Money Laundering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's commercial banks have
been warned not to allow money laundering or face stiff
punishment.
</P>
<P>
Commissioner of the Drug Enforcement Committee (DEC) Raphael
Mungole issued the warning Thursday in Ndola, northern Zambia
when he opened the Institute of Bankers workshop on money
laundering.
</P>
<P>
He said that the serious threat posed by drug trafficking,
money laundering, corruption and organized crimes call for
special functions to be performed by the central and commercial
banks.
</P>
<P>
"Investment efforts in our country will require a financial
and banking sector whose top management levels are transparent.
As a commission, we will walk and speak a soft voice in banks but
at the same time apply a big stick on individuals who flout
banking regulations especially false returns to Bank of Zambia,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that banks should develop mechanisms for identifying
suspicious cash transactions apart from knowing their customers
well.
</P>
<P>
"A code of conduct embodied in an anti-money laundering
legislation is urgently required to strengthen administrative
vigilance in banks and detect those that connive with criminals,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged banks to support a government anti-money laundering
bill which the cabinet is still debating.
</P>
<P>
He said narcotic drug crime and money laundering do not only
have an insidious corrupting effect which stimulates the growth
of secondary underground economy, but that it also debilitates
the legitimate banking and financial sector.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Province Moves to Regulate Planning of Villages, Towns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The legislature of east
China's Zhejiang province has approved a regulation standardizing
the planning, construction and management of villages and towns in
the province.
</P>
<P>
The regulation, which will be effective on January 1, 1998,
says villages and towns will be built in a unified way so as to
reduce land waste, convenience the residents and protect the
environment, said officials in the Standing Committee of the
Zhejiang Provincial People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
As economy has developed rapidly, many villages and towns have
been built in Zhejiang in recent years, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
However, the construction of villages and towns lacked unified
planning, resulting in unreasonable distribution, insufficient
facilities and ill-advised use of farmland, they said.
</P>
<P>
Residents are being encouraged to invest in the construction of
villages and towns, according to the regulation.
</P>
<P>
The regulation also stipulates that residents in villages and
towns should plant trees around their houses and build garbage
disposal centers.

<HEADLINE> Ghanaian Gold Dealers Against Dupery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The Ghanaian government has
warned gold dealers to avoid losing their money as dozens of
foreigners have been duped by Ghanaians parading themselves as
gold traders.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 60 people and companies, mostly foreigners from Europe
and Africa, have fallen victim to the fraud, according to a
government statement, quoted by a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
Some of the victims are from Belgium, France, Germany,
Hungary, Burkina Faso, Italy, Benin, Britain and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The value of the deals ranges from about 5,000 U.S. dollars to
12.5 million dollars, the statement said, adding that the victims
were promised non-existent gold dust, alluvial gold and gold
bars.
</P>
<P>
The government said a task force of security agencies had
begun compiling the cases to ensure the investigation and
prosecution of those involved.

<HEADLINE> Major Measures Urged to Protect Global Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Ecologists attending the
ongoing '97 China Environment Forum predict that the global
environment will be deteriorated if no major measures are
implemented.
</P>
<P>
Experts said today that the use of renewable resources -- land,
forest, fresh water, coastal areas, fisheries, and urban air -- is
beyond the resources' natural regeneration capacity and,
therefore, are unsustainable.
</P>
<P>
Suvit Yodmani, director and regional representative of the
United Nations Environment Program for the Asia-Pacific Region,
said that greenhouse gases are still being emitted at levels
higher than the stabilization target internationally agreed upon
under the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change.
</P>
<P>
The convention, passed in 1992, stipulates that the level of
greenhouse emissions in developed countries at the end of this
century should be reduced to 1990 levels.
</P>
<P>
Natural areas and the biodiversity they contain are diminishing
due to the expansion of agriculture and human settlements. Rapid,
unplanned urbanization, particularly in coastal areas, is putting
major stress on adjacent ecosystems, Yodmani said.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the increasingly pervasive use and
spread of chemicals is causing major health risks, environmental
contamination and disposal problems.
</P>
<P>
Yodmani warned that continued reliance on hydrocarbons in the
energy sector to fuel economic development is clearly an
unsustainable practice.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the complex interactions among global biological,
geological and chemical cycles are leading to widespread ecosystem
damage and change including acidification, climate variability,
changes in hydrological cycles and the loss of
biodiversity.

<HEADLINE> Zzambia to Reclaim Infested Land </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- A senior Zambian official has
said that there is urgent need to reclaim 33 percent of the
national land infested by tsetse flies, Times of Zambia reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Yotam Ngulube, deputy minister of agriculture, food and
fisheries, expressed his concern over the infested land Thursday
in Chilanga,20 kilometers south of the capital, while speaking at
the official handover of the European Union-constructed Regional
Tsetse Trypanosomiasis Control Program (RTTCP).
</P>
<P>
Ngulube said that the tsetse flies affect human life as well
as 25.percent of traditional herds of livestock throughout the
country.
</P>
<P>
Large tracts of agricultural land are not accessible for
settlements or agricultural production as a result, said the
deputy minister, adding there is urgent need to open up these
areas in order to accommodate the ever expanding population and
to meet the nation's growing demand for food.
</P>
<P>
Ngulube stressed regional cooperation in eradicating the
tsetse flies.
</P>
<P>
He said that the 11-year old RTTCP which includs Malawi,
Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Namibia has addressed the tsetse fly and
disease problem beyond administrative boundaries.
</P>
<P>
At the handover ceremony, European Union resident
representative Charles Brook said Zambia, which got the largest
share of the 52 million U.S. dollars allotted to the RTTCP, is
the only one of the five countries that has produced its own
national strategic plan for the tsetse flies.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Rejects Swazi's Territory Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Swaziland's claims to
her former territory in South Africa could never be entertained,
Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi, who is in Swaziland for a working visit, made the
remarks at a press conference in Mbabane airport, local media
reported.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi said the territory is now part of South Africa and
the issue of boundaries was settled long ago by an Organisation
of African Unity (OAU) charter, which recognized colonial
borders.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland, which wants a portion of South Africa's Mpumalanga
province transferred to the mountain kingdom, is signatory to the
charter, said Buthelezi.
</P>
<P>
There was no indication at the end of his visit that the
border issue had been discussed.
</P>
<P>
However, despite Buthelezi's statement and the OAU charter, a
six man border adjustment committee established by the late King
Sobhuza II following Swaziland's independence in 1989 to pursue
his country's century old claims to former Swazi territory in
South Africa, is still very active.
</P>
<P>
The committee, responsible to King Mswati III directly and
chaired by former home affairs minister Prince Khuzulwandle, is
still pursuing the border adjustment.

<HEADLINE> Informal Businesses Dominate Mozambique's Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Over 90 per cent of the
Mozambican-Swazi trade is dominated by informal businesses, a
report said here today.
</P>
<P>
The report done by a U.S. Christian organization named "World
Vision", released the figure at a symposium on the informal trade
along the Mozambique and Swaziland border.
</P>
<P>
The informal businessmen, mainly those involved in small
businesses selling daily necessities, have provided people in the
two countries, especially the poorest people, with more adequate
food supply, and stabilized the prices, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Informal trade, according to the report, is also dominating
Mozambique's trade with other neighboring countries, like South
Africa, Zimbabwe, Zambia and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
But the report also said Mozambique has suffered an
unfavorable trade balance as most of its exports through the
informal businessmen are agricultural products, while most of its
imports are products with high additional value.
</P>
<P>
The report said that a value of 77.34 million U.S. Dollar of
the Mozambique's exports are agro-products, 57.65 million dollar
are of non-agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
Experts at the symposium urged that Mozambique encourage
agricultural production and recognize the role informal
businesses are playing at times when there are food crises in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Mozambique, Tanzania, Zambia, South
Africa, Swaziland and Malawi attended the symposium.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Golf World
Cup will become the fourth event on golf's world tour, the PGA
Tour commissioner Tim Finchem announced in South Carolina, the
United States on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to a news report,the announcement was made at the

its last edition under the current format in 1999. Starting in
2000, it will be revamped to become part of the World Golf
Championships.
</P>
<P>
Finchem indicated that the current format of two-man teams from
32 nations playing four rounds of strokeplay is likely to be cut
but the resolution is yet to be finalized.
</P>
<P>
The event is likely to offer prize money around 4 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Finchem also said that the eligiblity might be changed to allow
more than one team from the stronger golfing nations to
participate. The comparably weaker nations would still have a
chance to qualify as well.
</P>
<P>
"The World Cup has a unique place in golf development around
the world," Finchem said, "We want to continue to utilize the
World Cup to develop that interest."
</P>
<P>
The World Golf Championships will begin in 1999 with three
events -- one matchplay and two strokeplay.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Two people were killed and two
others wounded today when about 30 suspected New People's Army
(NPA) rebels attacked a police checkpoint in Quezon province, the
central Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Jaime Karingal, Quezon provincial police director, said the
victims were three employees of the local Land Transportation
Office (LTO) and an unidentified farmer.
</P>
<P>
He said the rebels surprised the LTO personnel and several
traffic management policemen who were installing a checkpoint in a
village in Quezon province and started firing at them.
</P>
<P>
The rebels fled the area after the attack, making it difficult
for the police to pursue them, Karingal said.
</P>
<P>
NPA rebels recently launched at least three attacks on
policemen and took two police officers hostage. The government has
halted its formal peace talks with the rebel group.

<HEADLINE> Deputy President's Mother Closes Shop After </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 21 (Xinhua) -- If you don't have an
idea of the ubiquity of crime in South Africa, ask the
81-year-old mother of Deputy President Thabo Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
She closed her half-century-old store in Eastern Cape on
Thursday after an armed robbery.
</P>
<P>
"I want to close this store because my life is at risk and I
do not want to die violently," a sad Epainette Mbeki said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
The Goodwill store at Sofuthe village, which was two years
older than Thabo Mbeki, helped sustain the whole family during
the apartheid era when the father, Govan Mbeki, was in detention
and the four children, Thabo, Linda, Jama and Moeletsi, had to be
clothed, fed and educated.
</P>
<P>
"The reason for closing my store is a fair excuse, especially
(at) my age. I have managed to make a living and support my
children's education from the store when their father was
detained in 1960," Epainette said.
</P>
<P>
The store was robbed of an undisclosed amount of money on
Sunday. A policeman was seriously injured in a follow-up
operation in a forest near the home, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
Epainette was confronted by the armed men, but they fled when she
called her family.
</P>
<P>
In another scare on Wednesday, her grandson Lindisipho Potelwa
said he was sure one of the three suspected robbers returned to
the store.
</P>
<P>
"Because I was here on Sunday and have vivid identities of the
robbers, I saw one of them here yesterday pretending to be buying
some sweets," he said.
</P>
<P>
Epainette said her decision won support from Thabo Mbeki and
his wife Zanele.
</P>
<P>
Zanele rushed to be with her mother-in-law immediately after
she heard the news of the robbery.
</P>
<P>
Thabo Mbeki is expected to succeed Nelson Mandela as president
of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) at its mid-December
national congress and looks set to be next state president of
South Africa in 1999.

in today's session as it was pushed higher by stronger Asian
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
The currency settled at 69.46 U.S. cents, from a close Thursday
of 68.61 and after reaching a high of 69.65 earlier in the

<P>
The news from South Korea, Australia's second largest trading
partner, was also better with the won trading higher as officials
confirmed they were talking with the International Monetary Fund
about a possible bailout package.
</P>
<P>
However, analysts reiterated that market sentiment toward the
Australian dollar remains on the downside amid the financial
crisis in Asia and fears that this will impact negatively on the
domestic economy.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was at 87.59 yen from 86.89 yen
previously and at 1.2003 marks from 1.1899 marks.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Plans to Survey Marine Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government plans
to launch a survey on the country's marine resources to ascertain
the stock for their optimum exploitation, the Ministry of
Fisheries and Livestock said here today.
</P>
<P>
"We are taking steps to launch a survey on the marine fisheries
resources as suggested in the draft Fifth Five-year (1977-2002)
Plan to exploit non-conventional and un-exploited fisheries
resources in a planned way," a ministry official stated.
</P>
<P>
There are several under-exploited and un-exploited resources in
the Bay of Bengal like sharks, tuna, sardines, herrings, squids,
cuttlefish and lobsters, according to the draft plan.
</P>
<P>
The draft document observed that these resources may be
developed by "proper resource assessment" and introduction of
appropriate technology for their development.
</P>
<P>
"Since these are renewable living resources, unlike the mineral
ones, only judicious exploitation and scientific management can
ensure maximum benefit out of them," the draft plan added.
</P>
<P>
The government plan aims at exploiting the resources and ensure
their maximum sustainable yield because of their "huge" market
value abroad, the official stated.

according to provincial Labor Department officials.
</P>
<P>
Zhongshan, Dongguan, Jiangmen, and Shantou cities have been

The Labor Department has decided that employees should be
trained and get a certificate before they begin to work anywhere.

Poor people are allowed to pay tuition late or are exempt
from training fees, however, and workers can get subsidies during
their work-study programs.

<P>
In addition, the province says that employers should only
employ people with work certificates.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Rice Cultivation on Sandy Lands Looks Promising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have
successfully cultivated rice on the vast sandy lands of
northwestern China. With average per-hectare rice output reaching
more than 7,500 kilograms, the sandy lands have been turned into
high-yield farmland.
</P>
<P>
"We have grown rice on about 600 hectares of sandy lands, and
the techniques we applied will provide new means for sandy land
treatment," said Liu Xinming, director of the Lanzhou Institute of
Desert Research under the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Liu is
chief scientist for the research project.
</P>
<P>
"First, we pave a thin layer of plastic film at a certain depth
in sandy soil to prevent water and fertilizer from running
away. Then we make the land more productive by using special
fertilizers and water-saving irrigation techniques," Liu explained.
</P>
<P>
The institute began to test cultivation of rice on sandy lands
in 1992. Sites for testing included sandy land in Gansu Province
and the Ningxia Hui and Inner Mongolia autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
With improved techniques, the output of the "film-bottomed"
sandy fields has been two or three times as much as that of dry
farmland, and it is only 20 percent less than that of high-yield,
irrigated farmland.
</P>
<P>
China has vast areas of sandy land, with desert and
desertifiction land areas approaching 1.53 million square
kilometers, about 16 percent of the country's total land
area. Most of these lands are situated in Xinjiang, Gansu,
Ningxia, Shanxi and Inner Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
"Rice can be cultivated on millions of hectares of these sandy
lands. Besides, China has more than 200,000 square kilometers of
sandy land which can be irrigated through diversion works," Liu
said.
</P>
<P>
"With enough irrigation water, all of these sandy lands can be
cultivated with these techniques and turned into high-yield
farmland," he said.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Formally Applies for IMF Rescue Loan </HEADLINE>

<P>
SEOUL, November 21 (Xinhua) -- South Korea today formally
applied to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a rescue
package to bail out its plunging foreign exchange market.
</P>
<P>
Government officials said the application was filed with IMF
Vice President Stanley Fisher, now on a visit here.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, a member of the Washington-based IMF, applied for
about 50 billion U.S. dollars, which might be provided by other
IMF members including the United States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The country earlier refused to seek IMF assistance, which
requires economic structural reforms, despite recent serious
financial crisis similar to those hitting Southeast Asia.

<HEADLINE> Guangxi Autonomous Region of China Forming Sugar Conglomerate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region in south China, the country's largest cane sugar
producer, is in the process of forming a conglomerate to handle
most of the sugar production and marketing in the region.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi has led the country in cane sugar production for four
consecutive years. In 1996, the region produced 2.35 million tons
of sugar, or one-third of China's total output.
</P>
<P>
Sugar sales brought 10 billion yuan (1.2 billion U.S. dollars)
in 1996 and generated 1.3 billion yuan in taxes for the region.
</P>
<P>
However, scattered production and poor cooperation greatly
diminished the region's market competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
The regional government has encouraged key enterprises of
its 108 sugar producers to form a Guangxi Sugar Industry Group
Co. Ltd. for comprehensive sugar production, processing, research,
information exchanges and marketing purposes.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming sugar giant will be set up as a share-holding
enterprise, according to local sources.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Ratifies SADC Transport Protocol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's parliament on
Thursday ratified the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) protocol which seeks to establish uniform transport,
communications and meteorology systems that provide efficient
uniform operations in the region.
</P>
<P>
The protocol on transport, communications and meteorology was
signed by SADC heads of states and government in August 1996.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean transport and energy deputy minister Zenso Nsimbi
said the protocol would promote economic and social development
while being environmentally and economically sustainable.
</P>
<P>
The protocol was an international legal instrument meant to
acquire domestic legal force in the law of each member state.
</P>
<P>
"The protocol expresses the commitment of SADC member-states
to cooperate in collectively addressing pertinent matters and
priority issues within the transport, communications and
meteorology sectors from a regional perspective," said Nsimbi.
</P>
<P>
Nine sub-sectors including integrated transport, road
infrastructure, road transport and road traffic, maritime and
inland waterway transport, railways, civil aviation,
telecommunications, postal services and meteorology are covered
under the protocol.
</P>
<P>
Nsimbi said Zimbabwe had gone a long way in resolving some of
the issues raised in the protocol in that all towns, mines,
tourist areas and rural service centres were connected by
surfaced roads.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Indian Government Faces New Challenges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government is
facing new challenges as the Congress party threatened on Thursday
to withdraw support to the United Front (UF) coalition headed by
Prime Minister Inder Kumar Gujral unless a coalition partner was
ousted from the government.
</P>
<P>
Congress party President Sitaram Kesri on Thursday in a terse
letter asked the prime minister to choose between the Congress and
the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), a partner in the United Front
coalition.
Earlier in the day, a report tabled by a commission in both
houses of Parliament said the DMK was linked with the
assassination of former prime minister Rajiv Gandhi in 1991.
Kesri said in his letter, "The Congress Working Committee (CWC),
the highest policy-making body of the party, has decided that it
cannot continue to extend its support to the United Front
Government if the DMK continues to be a constituent of the
government in view of the indictment by the Jain Commission
report, tabled in both Houses of Parliament today."
</P>
<P>
The Congress actually sounded a death knell for the government
as it was the main supporter of the Gujral coalition.
</P>
<P>
Senior Congress leader Pranab Mukherjee told a press conference
Thursday that serious consequences would follow if the indictments
were not acted upon.
</P>
<P>
The angry Congress stalled proceedings in both houses of
Parliament to demand the DMK's ouster from the government and
forced the sessions to be adjourned for the day.
</P>
<P>
The core committee of the UF is expected to meet here this
morning to consider the response to Kesri's letter. Though the
letter did not set any deadline, it evidently expected an
immediate reply from the prime minister to the crucial question of
choosing between the DMK and the Congress.
</P>
<P>
In late March this year, the UF government headed by its first
prime minister D. Gowda fell due to the withdrawal of support by
the Congress. The Gujral government is still a minority government
in Parliament and it will face a similar fate if the Congress
repeats its March action.
</P>
<P>
DMK leader M. Karunanidhi on Thursday described the allegation
against his party as "politically motivated" and said it was
unacceptable. He added that there was no valid reason for DMK
ministers to quit.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the
country's biggest opposition party and the largest group in the
lower house of parliament, was out to fish in the troubled waters
by playing its card both inside and outside Parliament.
</P>
<P>
On the floor of the House, it pressed for tabling the Jain
Commission report and insisted on having a discussion on it.
Outside Parliament, it reiterated that its doors were open for
those wishing to avert a mid-term election. The BJP said that it
was keeping all its options open and would try to form a
government at the center if the Congress withdrew support to the
Gujral government.
</P>
<P>
There are several possibilities under the current
circumstances: the Gujral government drops the DMK and continues
to get support from the Congress; the Gujral government rejects
Congress' demand and falls; the BJP forms the government with the
support of other parties; or Parliament is dissolved and polls are
held. No matter which possibility occurs, the country's fluid
political situation will continue.

<TEXT>
<P>
Lusaka, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The Common Market for Eastern
and Southern Africa (COMESA) has embarked on a program to address
the expected food shortage in the 1998/99 season.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Daily Mail today quoted COMESA acting secretary general
Erastus Mwencha as saying here today that it will meet the World
Food Program next month to work out a strategy to address the
food shortage due to low rainfall arising from the El Nino
occurrence this year.
</P>
<P>
He said with proper coordination among COMESA member countries
it will be able to generate constant supplies of food all year
round.
</P>
<P>
"This is why we propose to establish free trade in
agricultural products in COMESA in 1999. You will also be
pleasantly surprised to learn that most member states already
have a zero or low tariff on agriculture commodities," he said.
</P>
<P>
El Nino is a climatical pattern that has brought about a dry
spell in the southern part of Africa with little or no rain in
some places.

<HEADLINE> Earliest Buddhist Statues of Tibetan Origin Confirmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Archeologists have confirmed
that three statues found in Fujian province six years ago are the
earliest examples of Tibetan Buddhism in China.
</P>
<P>
The statues were sculpted in 1291 for a general of the Yuan
Dynasty (1271-1368), who was a member of a Xixia ethnic minority
which had close relations with Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
"They are the earliest and best-preserved Tibetan Buddhist
statues ever found in China," said Wen Yucheng, a noted
archeologist and historian.
</P>
<P>
The 1.5-meter-high statues represent the three most respected
Buddhas, including Buddhism's founder Sakyamuni, who are symbols
of the past, present and future.
</P>
<P>
Archeologists said the founding will provide clues to the
studies of cultural exchanges between Tibet and China's hinterland.
</P>
<P>
Buddhism found its way into China in the first century through
several routes, including via Tibet.

<P>
BEIJING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The state will strengthen its
management and control of security services, an official with the
Ministry of Public Security was quoted as saying in today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
Lu Zhiqiang, vice-director of the Public Order Department under
the ministry, said that a campaign aimed at standardizing the
security industry will be carried out during the next eight months.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that security service companies that do not conform to
regulations will be banned or suspended, and security personnel
who are not qualified for the job will be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
Since China's first security service appeared in Shenzhen, a
special economic zone in South China's Guangdong Province, in
1985, the service industry has developed rapidly, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Security services are an important auxiliary method of
maintaining public order, Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Various kinds of security service facilities have helped
safeguard social security and in preventing and combating crimes,
Lu said.
</P>
<P>
To date, there are more than 1,500 security services nationwide
employing more than 250,000 people, according to Lu.
</P>
<P>
A considerable number of these companies violate rules
governing the establishment of security services, Lu said.

XINING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Qinghai's many farmers and
herdsmen are reaping financial benefits for limiting the size of
their families.
</P>
<P>
More and more farmers and minority people in this northwestern
province, consisting of the Han ethnical group and 42 different
minorities, willingly gave up their rights to favorable family
planning rules.
</P>
<P>
According to provincial rules, Han people who reside in
agricultural or pastoral areas are entitled to two children while
minority people can have three. However, most city dwellers can
have only one child.
</P>
<P>
China, which has one-fifth of the world's population, has
offered financial inducements to farmers to encourage fewer
children.
</P>
<P>
Ulan County has granted child-health subsidies and bought
old-age insurance policies for families who comply with family
planning rules.
</P>
<P>
Qinghai has poured a total of 18.8 million yuan (2.26 million
U.S. dollars) into helping 20,000 poor families hold down
population growth, said Han Yugui, an official of the Provincial

<HEADLINE> World's Oldest Map Discovered by Huang Yan and Yang Xinhe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Archeologists have
discovered a 2,300-year-old map clearly marked with distances in
north China's Hebei Province. It is believed to be the oldest map
of its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
The map was carved into a 96-cm-long, 48-cm wide and 0.8-cm
thick copper plate and includes a drawing of the royal mausoleums
of Wang Cuo (344-313 B.C.), the fifth king of Zhongshan Kingdom,
one of dozens of principalities in the epoch of warring states
(475-221 B.C.).
</P>
<P>
"It is not only the oldest map ever found in China but the
oldest map noted with numerals in the world," said Du Naisong, a
researcher with the Palace Museum located in Beijing's Forbidden
City.
</P>
<P>
The map, known as "Zhao Yu Tu" in Chinese, has been identified
by connoisseurs of cultural artifacts led by Du as a national
treasure.
</P>
<P>
Du is leading a group from China's major museums doing
appraisal work on cultural relics in Hebei. They believe Zhao Yu
Tu is important in the study of historic maps of China and the
world.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Yu Tu was unearthed from an underground palace of an
imperial mausoleum in Pingshan County, Hebei in the late 1970s. It
was not until recently that experts determined the special
historic value of the map.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Yu Tu marks locations of buildings in five mausoleums of
Wang, his queen and concubines. It also specifies halls, palaces
and gates of the mausoleums with words and graphic symbols.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-three places are marked with words and 38 places are
marked with symbols on the map. Symbols, numerals and epigraphs on
the map are inlaid with pure gold and silver. Lines, characters
and numerals at the central part of the map are in gold, while the
peripheral characters and lines are in silver.
</P>
<P>
Unlike modern maps, directions indicated on Zhao Yu Tu are with
the south on the top and the north at the bottom, said Zhang
Pingyi, a researcher from Hebei Museum, who reckoned the scale of
the map is approximately one cm to five meters.
</P>
<P>
Zhang's points have also been supported by historian Li Xueqin,
director of the Institute of History under the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences and Fu Sinian and Yang Hongxun, who are both
renowned archeologists in China.
</P>
<P>
The experts said that graph, symbol, scale, location, longitude
and latitude are key elements of a map. Zhao Yu Tu has these
elements except longitude and latitude, according to the
historians.
</P>
<P>
Also found on Zhao Yu Tu is a 42-character imperial edict of
the king. The edict was written in Jin Wen, an ancient language
used during the epoch of warring states. It has taken experts on
ancient languages a long time to interpret the edict.
</P>
<P>
The edict is an order from King Wang Cuo for the building of
his mausoleum. The king asked for two copies of Zhao Yu Tu, one to
be stored by the imperial court of Zhongshan Kingdom and the other
to be buried with the king.
</P>
<P>
The one discovered in Pingshan County was buried with the
king. Archeologists have no idea where the other copy is, or if it
still exists.
</P>
<P>
Zhongshan Kingdom (506-295 B.C.) was founded in today's central
and southern part of Hebei by the Xianyu ethnic minority
inhabitants of northern China.
</P>
<P>
The ancient kingdom was very advanced in smelting and copper,
according to experts who have studied more than 10,000 cultural
artifacts unearthed from the Zhongshan king's tomb.

<P>
LANZHOU, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Gansu Province in northwestern
China has 44 ethnic groups who are leaving remote mountainous
regions to help speed up the area's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
As a compact community site for the Hui ethnic group, Linxia
used to be a remote and economically backward region in Gansu. But
now one in every five local residents are engaged in
transportation or processing businesses.
</P>
<P>
Long-distance transportation teams consisting of Hui, Tibetan,
Dongxiang and Shala ethnic groups frequently travel the line
linking Qinghai and Tibet. They transport local products, daily
items and fashionable clothes made in coastal regions to Tibet and
bring back Tibetan-made artwork and medicinal herbs.
</P>
<P>
Hui business people from Linxia can be found peddling in almost
every large coastal city in southeast China. Some Linxia farmers
set up joint ventures at Tibet's border markets with businessmen
from neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
With more frequent economic exchanges going on, a group of
booming markets have emerged from the province's ethnic
regions. The products from the Longshan market in Zhangjiachuan
Hui Autonomous County have been sold to member countries of the
Commonwealth of Independent States.

<HEADLINE> Beijing's Largest State Grocery Changes Governmental Identity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's largest state-owned
grocery store is changing into a new company with a new strategy
using science and technology enhancement and chainstore methods,
even though it will continue to store food for the government.
</P>
<P>
The company plans to increase its annual sales to seven to
eight billion yuan by the end of the century, says Guo Li, the
company chairman and general manager.
</P>
<P>
The state-funded business has 16 subsidiaries and 38,000
employees and handles non-staple foods and drinks. It has
annual sales of five billion yuan (about 600 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The company grew out of Beijing's Second Bureau of Commerce,
which partly became a food industry and trade group in the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
The city's First Bureau of Commerce, specializing in
manufactured goods for daily use, already changed into a business
entity in July of this year.

<HEADLINE> China Develops Hydro-Electric Power Resources (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- This is the time for China to
exploit its hydro-electric power resources, and a major step was
taken on October 28 when the Yellow River was dammed for the
construction of the Xiaolangdi water control project in Henan
Province.
</P>
<P>
six 300,000-kw generators will be installed at Xiaolangdi and
they will generate 5.1 billion kwh of electricity a year when the
project is completed.
</P>
<P>
Then, on November 8, damming of China's longest Yangtze River
for the construction of the multi-purpose dam at the Three Gorges
was completed. The dam will be the biggest of its kind in the
world, and its 26 generators will be able to generate 84.6 billion
kwh of electricity a year, 13 billion kwh more than the Itaipu
power station in South America, presently the world's largest.
</P>
<P>
In a recent speech, Premier Li Peng called for increasing
hydro-electric power's share of the country's power from 25
percent now to 30 percent by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
The fact that the Chinese Government places greater importance
on developing hydro-electric power resources has brought
opportunities for China's minor rivers like the Lancang in the
southwest.

<P>
The Lancang River starts in the Tangula Mountains in Qinghai
Province and its name changes to the Mekong after it enters into
Southeast Asia. The 2,000-km river in China has vast
hydro-electric power potential and is a national hydro-electric
power development base. Plans call for 14 power stations with a
combined capacity of 22 million kw.
</P>
<P>
Diverse financing is providing the capital needed, You Wanlong,
manager of the Yunnan Dachaoshan Hydropower Co. Ltd. told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Work on the Dachaoshan Power Station began with damming
completed on November 10. It will cost 8.87 billion yuan, which
will come from the State Development and Investment Corp. and
three Yunnan companies. The State Development Bank has decided to
provide more than four billion yuan in loans.
</P>
<P>
The Asia Development Bank will also provide 100 million
U.S. dollars in loans to finance construction of Dachaoshan, which
is the second dam on the Lancang. The first is at Manwan and now
generates 5.9 billion kwh of electricity a year.
</P>
<P>
The Dachaoshan project will be able to generate 7 billion kwh
of electricity a year when completed in 2003. Its first generator
is scheduled to go online in 2001.
</P>
<P>
Downstream, the Jinghong Hydro-electric Power Station, which
will have a capacity of 1.5 million kw, will get backing from
Thailand and will mainly supply power to that country. Feasibility
studies for the project were completed recently.
</P>
<P>
Design work for the Xiaowan Station upstream, a key project for
developing resources on the Lancang, has been completed. The
station has an installed capacity of 4.2 million kw and will need
40 billion yuan.  It will be able to generate 19 billion kwh of
electricity a year when completed and will help other stations to
generate an extra seven billion kwh of electricity annually.

<HEADLINE> Italy to Take Measures Against Pedophilia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Italian government will take
measures to protect children following revelation of several
pedophilia cases a week ago, said Italian Minister for Social
Solidarity Livia Turco here today.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the measures would begin with the
introduction of sex education starting from elementary schools.
</P>
<P>
"The first center-left government intends to discuss it calmly
to arrive at a law in a matter of days," she said.
</P>
<P>
Proposals for introducing sex education in schools were
routinely turned down by the Christian Democrats who controlled
Italian politics for decades until the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Besides sex education, school teachers will be trained on how
to spot signs of child abuse on December 19 in Naples.
</P>
<P>
The government also supports increasing penalties against
convicted pedophiles, the minister said, but preventing the abuses
is more important than making punishment more harsh.
</P>
<P>
A nine-year-old Italian boy was killed last Friday, his body
burned, by a family friend in an attempt to prevent the boy from
telling his parents about years of sexual abuse, authorities
said.

<HEADLINE> Water shortage Hits Bangladesh's Northern Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The navigation and irrigation
network in the northern region of Bangladesh are being greatly
hampered due to an abnormal fall in the water level of all the
rivers and tributaries of the region.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources from the Agriculture Extension
Department here today, about 600,000 hectares of standing rice
crops in the region are experiencing acute irrigation crisis which
may lead to 30-40 percent reduction of the crops.
</P>
<P>
Due to adverse effect of the Farakka Barrage, the water level
of the Padma, Atrai, Barnoi, Gur Nondakuga, Karotia and Teesta and
other water bodies connecting with the Padma in the region have
fallen to a record mark this season, the sources stated, adding as
a result, the irrigation system had collapsed, and the navigation
in those river routes had been also affected seriously.
</P>
<P>
Of 113 tributaries of the Padma and Jamuna, only 40 can provide
irrigation facilities to the crop fields in this winter season.

<HEADLINE> China's Frozen Food Industry Finding Its Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Frozen food is becoming an
increasingly popular consumer item in China, but the industry is
still searching for ways to develop.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, China produced more than eight million
tons of frozen food, some of it exported to Japan, Southeast Asia,
and Europe, but, in spite of its huge development potential, there
are still problems that hinder development.
</P>
<P>
China's frozen food industry needs greater variety and more
brand-name and lower-priced products, according to today's Market
Daily.
</P>
<P>
Most Chinese frozen foodstuffs are sold to urbanites, but
buyers are limited to less than a dozen varieties of frozen
dumplings and steamed bread on the racks of major department
stores, chain stores, or small shops.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the price, quality, and nutritional value of most
frozen foods are unsatisfactory, something that experts say is
because of the rush to get involved by some medium-sized and small
enterprises that have inadequate facilities and technology.
</P>
<P>
The market is huge but not well explored in China. The
country's fast food industry, where frozen food is important, is
increasing at an annual rate of 20 percent, and its sales account
for a fourth of total of the food industry.
</P>
<P>
Some experts predict that frozen foods will account for 60
percent of the total food consumption worldwide in the future.

NEW DELHI, November 21 (Xinhua) -- India's Ministry of
Environment and Forests has allowed the auctioning of a stockpile
of uncleared imported hazardous waste, The Observer of Business
and Politics reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The stockpile has been lying at the Inland Container Depot at
Tughlaqabad in the capital since 1995.
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace has revealed in its investigations that more than
100 containers of hazardous and potentially hazardous wastes
including battery scrap, zinc ash, lead ash and waste oil are
stockpiled at the Inland Container Depot in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
"Our fear is that these illegally imported wastes may now find
their way to waste processing facilities around the country
because of the reported government decision," said Nityanand
Jayaraman of Greenpeace.
</P>
<P>
After the Supreme Court in the country banned imports of
hazardous waste in May 1997, an expert committee was appointed by
the court to study the hazardous waste situation in the country
and recommended a management plan.

<HEADLINE> Information Technology Important to Asian Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN FRANCISCO, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Asia's recovery from its
financial markets turmoil lies in new ways of doing business, a U.S.
business executive said here today at an international conference.
</P>
<P>
Opening the two-day Asia-Pacific Information Technology Summit
in San Francisco, Intel CEO Andy Grove, who chairs the meeting,
said that integrating global commerce is a factor right now in
Asia's financial crisis. In this view, the most important effect
of connectivity via PCs is that it reduces the minimum scale for
business to get into the game, he said.
</P>
<P>
A tool that makes sellers more efficient and buyers more
knowledgeable is a very effective economic infrastructure in a
society, Grove said in an interview with local press prior to the
conference.
</P>
<P>
The conference is sponsored by the Pacific Economic Cooperation
Council, a business-based organization that helps formulate policy
initiatives for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC).
</P>
<P>
The U.S. expenditures on exploiting Internet-based commerce are
three times the percentage of GDP of the Asian economies, Grove
said.
</P>
<P>
Pushing for more investment in connected computers and in
Internet commerce, Grove said that the world will have one billion
connected computers sometime in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
"The figure represents 15-20 percent of the world's population
and the greatest opportunity for countries on the Pacific Rim,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from integrating global commerce, Grove mentioned health
care and education as two other major problems that Asia is
facing. He said that computer connectivity can reach each of these
problems.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the policies he wants to promote at the
conference, which is attended by more than 500 industry leaders
and government officials, Grove said, "I am advocating one
policy: embrace information technology because your future depends
on it."
</P>
<P>
"It is a belief that technology can be a solution as compared
to a belief that technology is a luxury," said Grove.

BEIJING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- Faced with scientific
breakthroughs such as the cloning of sheep and the exploration of
life on Mars, Chinese media workers are preparing to tackle the
science revolution with a 36-part TV series.
</P>
<P>
"Life," adapted from Japanese NHK, will be aired by the Beijing
Television Station starting this weekend with the support of the
China Association for Science and Technology.
</P>
<P>
The program will tell Chinese audiences about the mystery of
life and how China can avoid isolation from the modern scientific
revolution, especially gene engineering, producer Zeng Tao said.
</P>
<P>
She said the program will use computerized three-dimensional
technology to duplicate four billion years of history during which
life was born and evolved into human beings.
</P>
<P>
The program will reveal stunning stories such as that the
dinosaur was not killed by a meteorite 65 million years ago but by
beautiful flowers and that Darwin's theory of evolution already
is outmoded.
</P>
<P>
Problems faced by modern people will be discussed along with
the future of our small planet, Zeng said.
</P>
<P>
The TV station will produce more scientific programs, including
"Universe," "Digital Times" and "Human Brain" to echo the
government's call to rejuvenate the country through science and
technology.
</P>
<P>
Many Chinese media have increased their coverage of science.
For example, China Central Television earlier this year replaced a
prime-time show on local scenery with a popular science
program.

<HEADLINE> River Polluters Face 40-Day Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 21 (Xinhua) -- All 1,500 polluters along the
Huaihe River, one of the five major rivers in China, face
compulsory shutdowns if they fail to meet national standards
before December 31, an official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Chinese authorities have compelled those businesses, each with
more than 100 tons of annual wastewater emissions, to stop
polluting the river. The Huaihe River flows through Anhui, Shandong,
Henan and Jiangsu provinces, and its basin extends for 270,000
square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will not waver in forcing the overhaul
of the 1,500 polluting businesses, said Zang Yuxiang, deputy
director of the Pollution Control Department under the National
Environmental Protection Agency (NEPA). Zang's remarks came at the
1997 China Environment Forum.
</P>
<P>
China's national plan for water pollution control stipulates
that all sources of industrial pollution in the river basin must
meet emission standards and that by 2000 the water quality in the
river's trunk, lakes and reservoirs should meet the requirements.
</P>
<P>
Last year's shutdown of nearly 5,000 small businesses reduced
river pollution by 25 percent. These stern measures by the
government and the December 31 deadline should reduce pollution
levels by another 30 percent, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1990s, deterioration of the Huaihe River's water
quality has been astounding, Zang said. Yearly emissions of 2.4
billion tons of wastewater seriously polluted drinking water
sources and caused heavy loss to industrial and agricultural
production, Zang said.
</P>
<P>
Wastewater from small paper mills and breweries are responsible
for more than 70 percent of the problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
China has appropriated 1.3 billion yuan (about 160 million
U.S. dollars) to reduce pollution in the river. World Bank loans
worth 400 million U.S. dollars also supported the clean-up of the
Huaihe River Basin, Zang said.
</P>
<P>
The most recent statistics show that 525 severe polluters have
met the required standards.
</P>
<P>
The river basin, an important grain and cotton production area,
covers 35 percent of the country and has a population of 150
million.

stated that the Ottawa Treaty on Landmines will probably not
significantly reduce the number of landmines in the world.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a symposium here Thursday, Directorate for
International Organizations of the Foreign Ministry Hasan Kleib
said that the treaty on the total ban of landmines will be signed
by 104 countries, including Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
He added that "but most of those countries are small states,
such as Fiji, Samoa, Togo and others. And the big countries such
as the United States will not sign it. So how can we expect a
significant reduction?"
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has decided to attend the Ottawa conference on

anti-personnel landmines.
</P>
<P>
There are at least 110 million landmines scattered in 60
countries around the world, mostly in Afghanistan, Angola, Bosnia,
Cambodia, Mozambique and Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Small countries only posses a small number of landmines, and
even if they are eliminated, the world will still posses a great
number of landmines, sources at the Foreign Ministry today quoted
Hasan as saying.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that there are more than 250,000 people around

<P>
CANBERRA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The lower Australian dollar
helped keep wool prices unusually stable at this week's sales, the
Australian Council of Wool Exporters (ACWE) said today.
</P>
<P>
The eastern market indicator rose two cents to close the week
at 710 Australian cents (487 U.S. cents) a clean kilogram while
the western market indicator remained unchanged at 649 cents (445
U.S. cents).
</P>
<P>
About 47,833 bales were offered, with a pass-in rate of 6.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
"The wool market has displayed an unusual degree of stability
in recent weeks with auction prices moving only marginally on
average at sales in (the two Australian cities of) Goulburn and
Geelong this week," the council said in its weekly wool market
review.
</P>
<P>
"The level of the Australian dollar relative to the major
buying currencies continues to be a very positive factor and is
helping to maintain widespread competition from local processors
and most of the major overseas traders."
</P>
<P>
Sales continue next week in Sydney, Melbourne and Fremantle
with a relatively large offering of 116,700 bales rostered.

destroyed two Tamil rebel boats which were traveling at high speed
towards Jaffna peninsula from the island of Iranathivu, Navy

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Supreme Court Takes up Petition Challenging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, November 21 (Xinhua) -- A three-member bench of the
Supreme Court of Pakistan, headed by Chief Justice Sajjad Ali
Shah, will take up a petition today challenging the 13th Amendment
to the constitution, informed sources said.
</P>
<P>
The 13th Amendment, which was passed by the parliament in April
this year, took away the powers of the president to dissolve the
National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the petition against the 13th Amendment
was not on today's case list of the apex court.
</P>
<P>
According to the original schedule, the first case to be taken
up by the court today is the contempt petition against Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif and 11 other respondents.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night, however, Sajjad ordered the court officials
to place the petition challenging the 13th Amendment on today's
list and it will be heard before the petition against the prime
minister, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
If the court upholds the petition against the 13th Amendment,
the controversial article 58 (2b), under which the president has
the powers to dissolve the National Assembly, will be restored,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The decision of the Supreme Court to take up the petition today
came only one day after the parliament was reportedly planning to
impeach the president because he was reluctant to sign the amended
contempt of court bill.
</P>
<P>
The bill was passed by the parliament on Tuesday tending to
give protection to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in the ongoing case
of contempt against him in the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
Under the Constitution of Pakistan, the president has 30 days
to assent the bill.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Sharif urged President Farooq Leghari to sign the
bill into law to end the prevailing political crisis in the
country.
</P>
<P>
But the Supreme Court on Thursday passed an interim order
asking the president not to assent the bill.

There is a large number of smokers in Central and Eastern
Europe, Romanian news agency ROMPRES quoted a poll result as

<HEADLINE> Computers With a Human Ear Demonstrated at Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAS VEGAS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- If you suffer repetitive
stress syndrome, or are a "professional word user" such as
lawyers, writers and doctors, then you probably have a wish when
using computers.
</P>
<P>
A voice-operated computer, which only requires voice commands
to operate could be the answer to your prayers.
</P>
<P>
Voice recognition has until now been plagued by inaccuracy in
translating voices to text on a computer screen, and lack of
intelligence in distinguishing between homonyms.
</P>
<P>
However, at the Comdex computer show, a few firms including
Lernout &AMP; Hauspie, Dragon Systems and IBM, are introducing
software that brings the dream closer to reality.
</P>
<P>
In preview demonstrations this week, Voice Xpress created an
on-screen letter dictated in a normal speaking voice. It also
performed editing functions such as bold-facing and italicizing
words or phrases and indenting paragraphs, all through oral
commands. It could color highlight words it was not sure about and
give an author a quick review.
</P>
<P>
The ultimate aim is to make households without computers buy
them by enabling people to talk to their computers.
</P>
<P>
At present, little more than 40 percent of homes in North
America have personal computers. The companies at the show
expressed hope that with attractive pricing and continued
refinement for ease of use, their technology will catch on with
the non-computer literate.
</P>
<P>
Compaq Computer Corp. president Eckhard Pfeiffer described the
future digital home with a computer center in the basement,
running a network and myriad computers and devices in every room,
from a PC Theater to a device that looks like a cellular phone for
electronic mail. He said Compaq also expects automobiles to be
equipped with a PC and Internet access operated by voice commands.
</P>
<P>
One obstacle to easy use right now is the need to "train" the
software by reading 100 to more than 200 sentences so that the
program learns individual voice patterns.
</P>
<P>
But an IBM marketing manager predicted that within five years
there will be "full duplex communication," where computers perform
requested tasks like finding documents, sending letters and
reading e-mail.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft chairman Bill Gates also said that speech recognition
would be one of the important technical advances of the future.

HELSINKI, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Finnish President Martti
Ahtisaari is to pay an official visit to Russia on November 26-27
at the invitation of Russian President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
The two presidents will discuss the promotion of bilateral
economic and trade cooperation, the relationship between Russia
and the three Baltic states, cooperation around the Baltic Sea,
Russia-European Union ties, and the impact of the eastward
expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
Ahtisaari will also meet Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin and Chairman of the Federation Council (upper house
of parliament) Yegor Stroyev. The two countries will sign an
framework agreement on export guarantees.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Ahtisaari will also attend some of the
Finland Day festivities in Moscow, Finland's biggest overseas
celebration in memory of the 80th anniversary of the Finnish
independence.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony also attracts some thousand Finns from the domains
of politics, economy, culture and business.
</P>
<P>
Finland has been devoted to advancing Russia's participation in
the European integration process since Finland join the European
Union early 1995.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here maintain that this visit will help
strengthen the two countries' bilateral ties and boost the
development of the Russia-EU relationship.

LISBON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Portuguese Defense Minister
Antonio Vitorino, who also serves as a minister in the prime

</P>
<P>
Vitorino revealed his decision during an emergency news

<HEADLINE> Jiang's Mexico Visit to Make History: Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Mexican Foreign Minister
Jose Angel Gurria said here today that the upcoming visit of
Chinese President Jiang Zemin to Mexico will make history in the
relations of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"We are setting the basis for what will be the relations of
China and Mexico in the next century," Gurria said, referring to
Jiang's November 30 to December 3 visit.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Gurria said the Mexican government
is greatly honored to receive a visit from President Jiang.
</P>
<P>
He said leaders of the two countries have been in close contact
in recent years and that Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo and
President Jiang Zemin have cultivated a very good personal
relationship.
</P>
<P>
In recalling the development of the two nation's bilateral
relationship, Gurria said that Mexico values its ties with China.
The two countries are now on good terms and there is no obstacle
to the development of such a relationship, he said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Mexico's policy that there is only one China and
that Taiwan and Tibet are part of China.
</P>
<P>
"There are some issues which Mexico has always maintained
regarding China, especially the recognition of only one China," he
said. "The Mexican position about Tibet and Taiwan has never
wavered."
</P>
<P>
He also said that Mexico supports China's bid to enter the
World Trade Organization because the organization will not be
complete if an economy as important as China is absent.
</P>
<P>
On the topic of commerce and investment, Gurria said there are
some aspects that do no reflect the importance of the economies
nor the potential they have.
</P>
<P>
He hoped the meeting of the two heads of state can help advance
the cause of commerce and the economy and promote exchanges of
entrepreneurs between the two countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Rome police said today that an
American citizen accused of sexually abusing two children was
arrested here two days ago following a tip-off by the Federal
Bureau of Investigation (FBI).
</P>
<P>
Joe Daniel Frederich, a 54-year-old computer expert, is wanted
in Texas in the United States where he is accused of raping two
teenagers.
</P>
<P>
The wanted man, who is confined to a wheelchair, drove to Rome
in a caravan, police said.
</P>
<P>
More than 95,000 U.S. dollars in cash, traveler's checks,
several portable computers and disks were discovered in the
caravan.
</P>
<P>
The FBI has been trying to trace Frederich since he left Texas
in April.
</P>
<P>
Frederich was found by Italian police in a hotel on the
outskirts of Rome. The United States Embassy in Rome said he
would be extradited to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The arrest comes in the wake of a series of tragic paedophilia
cases in Italy which have caused a flurry of concern, and even
calls for schools to be patrolled by vigilantes.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Astronauts on Columbia Delay Launch of Satellite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. space shuttle
Columbia's astronauts today delayed releasing a satellite that
observes the sun because of spacecraft problems, the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) said.
</P>
<P>
NASA ordered the crew to wait until Friday before launching the
Spartan satellite from the spacecraft for a two-day-flight.
</P>
<P>
The suspension was ordered after NASA found voltage problems
with Soho, another solar observatory. Soho shut itself down just
hours before Columbia blasted off Wednesday. Ground controllers
had the two-year-old observatory back in operation Thursday
evening.
</P>
<P>
The Spartan will observe the Sun at the same time as Soho does
so scientists can compare measurements. Soho is nearly 1.68
million kilometers from the Earth and 155 million kilometers from
the sun, a point where the gravitational pull of the Earth and the
sun cancel each other.
</P>
<P>
The mission of the satellite is to observe the layer of ionized
gas surrounding the sun called the corona as well as the charged
particles streaming into space from the sun.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, astronauts aboard the Columbia spent their second
day in outer space conducting experiments. Ukrainian astronaut
Leonid Kadenyuk tended flowering mustard plants and pollinated
them.
</P>
<P>
Columbia is carrying 18 mature mustard plants and 162 mustard
seeds. Some of the plants are expected to blossom before the
mission ends. The experiments are intended to shed light on what
kinds of plants might be grown for food on a trip to Mars.

their cultural exchange and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting, Voltroni, who is also the minister of culture

cooperation in opera, films, music and sports as culture plays an
important role in international relations.
</P>
<P>
He said China was welcome to hold various exhibitions in Italy,
especially cultural ones.

between the two countries would develop along with cooperation in
politics, economy and science and technology.

<HEADLINE> Schuessel's Comments on NATO Membership Spark Repercussions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Austrian Foreign Minister
Wolfgan Schuessel's latest comments on the country's proposed NATO
membership have sparked repercussions from political circles of
the country.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published today by the Czech newspaper "Pravo,"
Schuessel commented that Austria's maintenance of neutrality
didn't constitute barriers to the country's joining NATO, but
necessitated changes of the law.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the comments were made public here, the Social
Democratic Party of Austria said Schuessel's remarks were not
serious and didn't conform to the country's constitution as NATO
was still a military bloc. Schuessel doubles as the Vice
Chancellor of Austria.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian constitution stipulates that Austria is not
allowed to join any military blocs.
</P>
<P>
Austrian President Thomas Klestil, a member of the Austrian
People's Party (APP), told a press conference that joining NATO
was not compatible with remaining neutral.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian Freedom Party claimed that Schuessel's comments
were "very irresponsible", and the Green Party described it as
absurd and detrimental to the neutral principle.
</P>
<P>
The issue of NATO membership has long been Austria's focus of
debate.
</P>
<P>
Leading members of the APP have voiced support for Austria's
joining NATO from time to time. But the mainstream of the Social
Democratic Party of Austria, the other party in the ruling
coalition, stands firmly for the country's neutrality.
</P>
<P>
The two ruling parties, widely divided on the application for
NATO membership, have decided to jointly make a report stating
their individual reasons.
</P>
<P>
The report will be submitted next March for discussion by the
country's Federal Council.

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian PM Complains About Trade Conditions With EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian Prime Minister Valery
Pustovoistenko today asked the European Union (EU) to revise its
anti-dumping procedures and the quantitative limits on Ukrainian
goods.
</P>
<P>
Pustovoistenko said while meeting envoys of EU members that the
strict protective tariff policy of the EU had a negative impact on
Ukrainian exports.
</P>
<P>
Pustovoistenko stressed his country did not impose
corresponding anti-dumping measures or quantitative limits on EU's
exports to Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Next to Russia, the EU is Ukraine's second largest trading
partner. The yearly trade volume between the two sides accounts
for 14.3 percent of Ukraine's total. The volume for the first nine
months this year stood at 3.6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to Ukraine's Interfax news agency, 70 to 80 percent
of EU's aid to Ukraine was used for public utilities for foreign
exporters, while 20 to 30 percent was used for purchasing
equipment and training expenses of Ukrainian experts.
</P>
<P>
The EU's aid to Ukraine has amounted to 3.16 billion dollars in
recent years.

<P>
BUDAPEST, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Hungarian government
today gave official recognition to the majority of voters who
recently approved of NATO membership.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the National Assembly on the final result of the
referendum held last Sunday, Kukorelli Istvan, chief of the
national election commission, said among the 49 percent of eight
million eligible voters who took part in the referendum, 85
percent voted for Hungary's entry into the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
The result is valid, said the election chief. The total number
of voters in favor of NATO membership far exceeds the required
legal limit of 25 percent and no fraud or discrepancies were found
in the polling procedure.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the fairness, Russia, Romania, Britain, Belarus and
the Czech Republic sent observers to monitor the first referendum
held in Hungary since 1991.
</P>
<P>
Of the three countries invited to join NATO, Hungary is the
only one to decide by referandum. The other two invitees are

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria to Further Promote Privatization in Food Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- By the end of 1998, 85 percent
of Bulgarian enterprises in the food and flavor industry will be
privatized, Bulgarian Deputy Industry Minister Stefan Stavrev
announced here today.
</P>
<P>
Stavrev said private interests control about 67 percent in 148
companies out of a total of 263 enterprises in the sector. A total
of 172 companies are at different stages of privatization.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, 1,174 private partnerships in the
country have been established in the dairy, meat-processing, and
wine industries, sugar refineries, and fishing enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The shares of the first dozen companies in the sector will be
offered on the stock exchange in early 1998, Luchezar Kolev, an
expert in the ministry, said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the ministry show the food and flavor
industries account for 20.8 percent of Bulgaria's
manufacturing. The products of the food and flavor industry make
up 17.4 percent of its exports.
</P>
<P>
The main problem the industry faces is a shortage of raw
materials, said Stavrev. The sugar refineries import 95 percent of
their raw materials. The situation in the canning industry is
similar. The industry is currently operating at only 35-40 percent
of capacity.
</P>
<P>
Other problems in the sector arise from difficulties in
obtaining loans, the poor management of some enterprises and
unfair competition.
</P>
<P>
According to the Deputy Minister, important prerequisites for
the industry's development are equalizing standards with Europe,
the attraction of more investment, and the renovation of
technologies.

<HEADLINE> Liberia-ECOMOG Rift Widens on Army Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The rift between Monrovia and
ECOMOG over the restructuring of Liberia's armed forces further
widened as President Charles Taylor today reaffirmed the
government's determination to do the job by itself.
</P>
<P>
The Liberian government will expel anyone in the high command
of the west African peace-keeping force (ECOMOG) that attempted
to challenge or share the constitutional power of the president,
Taylor warned.
</P>
<P>
In a nationwide broadcast from the executive mansion today,
Taylor said he does not expect anyone in ECOMOG to overstep his
authority and remain in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
"There cannot and will not be a parallel authority," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet ministers and legislators listening to the president
applauded, according to a British Broadcasting Corporation
report.
</P>
<P>
Taylor did not mention any names today but his warning came in
the wake of a whirl of words between the government and ECOMOG
Force Commander Major-General Victor Malu over the formation of a
post-war army in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Following a cabinet meeting chaired by Taylor on Wednesday,
the government issued a stern warning to Malu to decease acts
incampatible with the status as a peace-keeping commander.
</P>
<P>
Malu has not yet reacted to the warning, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In his broadcast today, Taylor said Liberia no longer needs a
peace keeping force and only hopes the strengthening of the
capacity of the new government, which was inaugurated on August 2
this year.
</P>
<P>
The president disclosed that the armed forces of Liberia is
currently being restructured by the government.
</P>
<P>
He said the phase on restructuring has already begun and funds
will be made available to the ministry of national defense next
week to renovate barracks around the country.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG was sent to Liberia in the heat of the country's civil
war launched by Taylor at the end of 1989.
</P>
<P>
The force has helped end the seven-year bloody war and put
Taylor to the top seat of the country although the former warlord
reportedly never liked the Nigerian-led ECOMOG for fear of the
expansion of Nigeria's interest in his country and the sub-region
as well.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement that brings peace to Liberia, ECOMOG is
mandated by west African leaders to help restructure and train a
new army for the country.

<HEADLINE> Former S. African President Served with Subpoena </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
president P.W. Botha was served today with a subpoena to appear
before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) at a hearing
on the State Security Council in Cape Town on December 5.
</P>
<P>
The five-page subpoena, together with more than 700 pages of
documentation related to the hearing, was handed to a security
official at Botha's retirement home at Wilderness, South African
Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
Today's delivery followed Botha's statement earlier this week
that he would not attend the hearing, and his lawyer's refusal to
accept the subpoena delivered in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
Two TRC officials flew from Cape Town to George, a city more
than 400 kilometers eastward, and drove to Wilderness to deliver
the subpoena.
</P>
<P>
TRC Deputy Chairman Alex Boraine said in a statement afterward
that it was the TRC's "very deep hope" that Botha would appear at
the hearing.
</P>
<P>
Botha was first subpoenaed to attend the initial round of
State Security Council hearings in Johannesburg earlier this
month, along with fellow members of his former cabinet.
</P>
<P>
His testimony was postponed on the grounds of ill health, and
commission chairman, Desmond Tutu then offered to hold the next
round of hearings in George, only several kilometers away from
Wilderness.
</P>
<P>
However, after Botha indicated his unwillingness to attend,
Tutu said the hearing would continue and if the former state
president failed to appear, he would be prosecuted in terms of
the commission's founding bill.
</P>
<P>
The Promotion of National Unity and Reconciliation Act allows
for a fine or up to two years of imprisonment for disobeying a
subpoena.
</P>
<P>
Botha refused to apologize for the role of its apartheid
government and accused the TRC of being a revenge camp against
the Afrikaner.
</P>
<P>
The TRC is a special court set up to heal the wounds of the
apartheid era.

<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Jordan today expressed welcome
to Iraq's decision to allow all U.N. inspectors to return to their
monitoring work in Iraq, Radio Jordan reported.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Jordanian Minister of State for
Information Affairs Samir Mutawe. The agreement might bring an end
to the standoff between Iraq and the U.N., which lasted about
three weeks, said Mutawe.
</P>
<P>
Jordan really hoped that Iraq's decision could defuse the
tension, Mutawe was quoted as saying to the reporters after a
regular cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
The crisis began after Iraq refused on October 29 to allow the
American inspectors to enter the sites which the U.N. arms
inspectors wanted to inspect. On November 4, Iraq expelled the
American inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The agreement might be the first step for lifting the
sanctions, Mutawe said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Russia have reached an agreement on Iraq's allowing
the U.N. inspectors to return to Iraq to continue their monitoring
work.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, Russia will work for the lifting of
the seven-year-old U.N. economic sanctions, which bar Iraq from
exporting its oil.
</P>
<P>
The crisis focused world attention on the plight of the Iraqi
people suffering from the sanctions, he said, adding that Jordan,
one of Iraq's largest trade partners, always called for an end to
the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions were imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait. Only when the U.N. arms inspectors assert that all
chemical, biological and mass-destruction weapons in Iraq are
destroyed, can the sanctions be lifted.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Militias Accuse Junta of Breaching </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Kamajors, a group of hunter
militias accused of renewing attacks against soldiers of the
Sierra Leonean military regime, today blamed the junta for
violating cease fire in the country.
</P>
<P>
A Kamajor official, Eddie Mando, said that the traditional
hunters accepted the peace agreement because it was in the best
interest of Sierra Leone and the Kamajors, a report reaching
here said today.
</P>
<P>
The peace accord, which was signed last month in Conakry,
Guinea, calls for a cease fire, disarmament and demobilization of
combatants, as well as reinstatement of ousted President Ahmed
Tejan Kabbah in April next year.
</P>
<P>
According to Mando, soldiers of the junta, which seized power
in the May 25 coup, are attacking the Kamajors and innocent
civilians as part of their "tricks".
</P>
<P>
However, he admitted that cease-fire violations in clashes
between the two sides were straining the fragile peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
The allegation runs counter to reports of renewed attacks by
the Kamajors against junta forces over the past days at the
diamond mining town of Tongo in southeast of the country.
</P>
<P>
The British Broadcasting Corporation Wednesday quoted
residents who fled Tongo as saying that the Kamajors had captured
all the roads leading to the town.
</P>
<P>
The Kamajors have also warned all the civilians to leave the
town by November 28 before they launch an all-out attack on the
junta forces who have held the town since the coup.
</P>
<P>
A junta spokesman reportedly said earlier that the ruling
Armed Forces Revolutionary Council will report the incidents to
the west African peace-keeping force (ECOMOG).
</P>
<P>
There has been no response heard from ECOMOG which is mandated
by the west African countries to monitor the peace process in
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a visit to Freetown today by west African foreign
ministers who brokered the Conakry agreement has been postponed.
</P>
<P>
The visit of the foreign ministers of Nigeria, Ghana, Cote
d'Ivoire, Guinea and Liberia is designed to strengthen the
agreement while the junta differs with ECOMOG over whether the
national army of Sierra Leone should be disarmed.
</P>
<P>
The junta has said the visit may take place on November 28.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu noted today that the latest terror attack
in Jerusalem reminded the Jewish state again of the need to fight
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference held in Prime Minister's Office
this afternoon, Netanyahu said that Israel can not accept terror
activities such as last night shooting, in which one Jewish
religious student was killed and another was seriously wounded in
the Muslim quarter of East Jerusalem's Old City.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that the security patrol in the country will
be strengthened. And he urged the Palestinian National Authority
to continue fighting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
So far no one claimed responsibility for the attack, but it
was suspected to be carried out by Muslim militants.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu held talks today with top cabinet ministers and
security officials on the attack. During the meeting, Jerusalem
mayor Ehud Olmert demanded that Israel suspend recent resumed
peace talks with Palestinians, saying they are not keeping their
obligation to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Netanyahu also addressed the issue of
the crisis in the ruling Likud Party. He suggested that a
referendum of Likud members around the country should be held to
decide what is the best way to elect Likud candidates for the
Knesset (parliament).
</P>
<P>
He said that the result of the referendum will be offered to
the party central committee. And the committee will made its
decision if it is necessary to restore the election primaries,
which was dumped last Wednesday at a controversial party
convention.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Junta Sacks Officials for Irregularities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone' military junta
has sacked one and suspended eight top military officials, mostly
in connection with financial irregularities.
</P>
<P>
Alfred Muna, secretary-general of the Boat Owner's Association
and member of the military's Supreme Council of State, was sacked
for his involvement in "some dubious activities," one state house
aide said, quoted by a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The military leader, Major Johnny Paul Koroma, on Sunday
suspended eight other council members and placed them under "mass
arrest", the report said.
</P>
<P>
The eight "honorables" are alleged to have "undermined the
revenue-generating capacity" of the diamond-rich country's
Ministry of Mines and Mineral Resources.
</P>
<P>
No official explanation has been given for the suspensions,
but military sources are quoted as saying the eight had "set in
place a reign of anarchy inconsistent with state stability".
</P>
<P>
For the past three months, mining ministry officials have
refused to travel to diamond mining areas in the east, claiming
they fear that senior military members are seen in the area with
heavily armed bodyguards.

<HEADLINE> Azerbaijan's FM Visits Lebanon to Boost Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The visiting Azerbaijani
Foreign Minister Gasan Aziz Gasanov today expressed hope to boost
ties with Lebanon, saying the two countries' resources are
mutually complementary.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with his Lebanese counterpart Fares Boueiz, he
told reporters that Lebanon enjoys huge funds while Azerbaijan is
rich in oil. The two countries can achieve joint profits by
cooperation, said Gasanov, who arrived here today for a two-day
visit.
</P>
<P>
When asked about Azerbaijan's internal affairs, he said he is
glad that his country's territorial conflict with Armenia has been
resolved by peaceful means, and the situation in the region is now
stable.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he stressed that the same way should be applied on
the Lebanese-Israeli conflict, calling on Israel to observe the
United Nations Security Council resolutions and withdraw its
troops from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel established a 1,200-square kilometer "security zone" in
south Lebanon in 1985 to protect its northern border from Lebanese
guerilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Lebanon, Gasanov also held talks with
Lebanese President Elias Hrawi, Parliament Speaker Nabih Berry and
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese press report said that the aim of the visit by
Gasanov is to deal with this central Asia country's
recently-discovered oil.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Prisons in Deplorable State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Most Zambia's prisons are in
such deplorable state that they have become a breeding place for
hard core criminals instead of reformation, some parliament
members told parliament here today.
</P>
<P>
Sikota Wina from the ruling party said that prisons have
become places of anguish, torture and misery that efforts to
reform prisoners will be futile.
</P>
<P>
Moving a motion for the house to adopt the report of the
Committee on Social Services, Wina said there is hopelessness and
widespread starvation in prisons so that prisoners are sometimes
forced to eat wild creatures such as lizards, snakes and owls.
</P>
<P>
He recommended that the entire prison service should be
overhauled so that government's well intended purpose of
reforming prisoners could be achieved.
</P>
<P>
Independent parliament member Charity Mwansa cited Kabwe
Maximum Security Prison which was intended to accommodate 450 but
there are now 970 prisoners while Kabwe Central Prison has 540
instead of 280 prisoners.
</P>
<P>
She said Lusaka Central accommodates 1,271 instead of the
intended 260 prisoners.
</P>
<P>
She wondered how prisoners can be treated so badly and called
on the government to create better living standards for
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Another parliament member urged the government to engage
prisoners in production so that they can be self-reliant.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the prisons are too congested and too
filthy for human habitation.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopians Suffer From Fluoride-related Ailments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 20 (Xinhua) -- About 90 percent of the
people residing in the Ethiopian Rift Valley areas suffer from
the effect of fluoride which attacks bone and tooth, Ethiopian
Minister of Water Resources Shiferan Jarso said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, when opening an
international workshop on fluoride in Nazreth, 90 kms away from
Addis Ababa, the minister said people living in the Rift Valley
areas are the most vulnerable to diseases caused by fluoride as
they use underground water.
</P>
<P>
He said if the amount of fluoride contained in a liter of
water exceeds 1.5 milligram, it will be dangerous to health,
adding that there are water wells in the area with fluoride
content of over 20 grams per liter.
</P>
<P>
The minister said fluoride causes tooth-decay in children
below the age of 12 and could expose to bone diseases in the case
of adults above the age of 45.
</P>
<P>
He told the participants that efforts to harness the river
Awash to supply fluoride-free water to residents in towns will
further be enhanced alongside endeavors to create favorable
conditions whereby the scientific techniques used elsewhere will
be adopted to filter the water the rural populace uses.
</P>
<P>
The workshop is attended by participants from South Africa,
India, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Uganda and Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The first international workshop on fluoride was held in
Arusha, Tanzania two years ago.

<HEADLINE> Winter Olympic Downhill Issue to Be Decided on December 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The dispute over the length of
the men's downhill course will be resloved by December 1, the
Nagano Olympic organizing committee executives said here on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hironoshin Furuhashi, head of a five-man group formed to decide
the issue, said that the body will tour the upper half of the
2,696-meter Mount Karamatsu next Monday and decide upon the height
of the downhill course's starting gate.
</P>
<P>
NAOC offered earlier this month to move the start gate from
1,680 meters above sea level to 1,740 meters, provided that the
course does not encroach upon a protected national park area.
</P>
<P>
The International Ski Federation (FIS) responded by proposing
four alternative start points at 1,760, 1,764, 1782 or 1,794
meters. But with these options, passing through the protected
area is unavoidable.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Isiah Thomas, former
superstar of National Basketball Association (NBA) champions
Detroit Pistons, resigned Thursday as general manager of the
Toronto Raptors.
</P>
<P>
Thomas, one of the NBA All-time best 50, was set to sell his
minor nine percent interest in the team to majority owner Allan
Slaight, a Raptors spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Thomas, whose post in the struggling Raptors was executive vice
president, had a dispute with Slaight over ownership and
management issues. His bid for buying majority control of the
team from Slaight, who owns 81 percent of the franchise, was also
declined.
</P>
<P>
Their relationship was reportedly strained ever since.
</P>
<P>
"It is with regret that we say good-bye to Isiah Thomas,"
Slaight said in a statement. "He has made an important
contribution to this franchise and we will miss him."
</P>
<P>
Thomas, came to Raptors as a manager on May 24, 1994, is a
housename in Toronto for his constructive work in the team.
Raptors' all-time leading scorer Damon Stoudamire, selected by
Thomas as the seventh pick overall in first round in 1995, said
Thomas was the only reason he stayed in Raptors.
</P>
<P>
The NBC reportedly offers Thomas an analyst job on NBA
telecasts and a show on MSNBC, one of the network's cable
outlets.

KUWAIT CITY, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Deputy Foreign
 Minister Tian Zengpei left here today for Bahrain to continue his
 tour of the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day stay here, Tian delivered a message to the
 Kuwaiti Amir from Chinese President Jiang Zemin on ways to promote
 bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Tian arrived here Tuesday on the second leg of his Middle East
 trip which had already taken him to Turkey and will also take him
 to Bahrain, Oman and Qatar.
</P>
<P>
He was received by Kuwaiti Amir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah

 Al-Salem Al-Sabah. He held talks with his Kuwaiti counterpart

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Stock market in Record Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
HARARE, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's stock market,the
 second largest stock market in Africa, today continued its
 free-fall when it lost a 668.51 points, in a record single day
 plunge, on the back of waning investor's confidence about the
 future of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Stockbrokers reiterated that the panic on the local bourse was
 a result of uncertainty over the huge payments to be made to
 former freedom veterans by the government, the threat of
 nationalisation of commercial farms for resettlement of landless
 peasants and last week's sharp devaluation of the Zimbabwe
 Dollar.
</P>
<P>
The industrial index, which is the country's economic
 barometer, fell by another all time record of 500 points on
 Wednesday. It now stands at 8,457.99.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said although the government had taken measures to
 arrest the drop in the local currency, resumption of the balance
 of payments support from the International Monetary Fund is
 crucial to further stabilize the dollar.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: U.S. to "Wait and See" Iraq's Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton,
 wary of Iraq's permission to allow U.N. weapons inspectors
 including Americans back on their work, said on Thursday that he
 will "wait and see" Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's next
 action.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's Revolutionary Command Council earlier issued a
 statement, saying "Iraq has accepted the return of U.N. Special
 Commission (UNSCOM) inspectors, including the Americans," to
 Baghdad and resume their work.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said it was not enough to just make a statement by
 Saddam Hussein, "We will wait and see" if he does what he says, he
 emphasized.
</P>
<P>
"The United States must remain and will remain resolute in
 our determination to prevent him from threatening his neighbors
 of the world with nuclear, chemical or biological weapons," the
 president said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the White House welcomed Iraq's decision to reverse
 his ban on American weapons inspectors, saying it was "an
 encouraging development."
</P>
<P>
But the statement "must ultimately be tested by what Saddam
 Hussein does," White House spokeswoman Anne Luzzatto said. "We
 have to see how it unfolds."
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, now in Geneva
 attending an emergency meeting with four other permanent members
 of U.N. Security Council on the weapons inspection crisis,
 called Iraq's decision "a step in the right direction."
</P>
<P>
"It's the secretary's view that the announcement out of
 Baghdad is a step in the right direction," said State Department
 spokesman James Rubin, who is accompanying Albright on her world
 travel.
</P>
<P>
"Our objective was to see the unconditional return of the
 U.N. inspectors. Our strategy was to combine intensive
 diplomacy, that is the unity of the major powers, with a robust
 military posture and if the inspectors return, then our
 objectives will have been met," he said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Open Stock Mart in Early 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 19 (Xinhua) -- the long-awaited stock
market will open early next year, after the country's Capital
Markets and Securities Authority (CMSA) approved the first
listing, Daily News said today.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania Oxygen Ltd (TOL), a state-owned company regarded as a
blue chip stock by local standards, had been pressing for urgent
approval of its prospectus in order to fund expansion through an
initial public offering of shares.
</P>
<P>
"The prospectus has been approved. We're waiting for the final
version. We'll do a timetable to indicate when shares will be
traded," said Hamisi Kibola, director of legal services for CMSA
and chief executive officer of the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
"In terms of sequence, we're talking of TOL as the first
company (for listing)," Kibola was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Kibola said that the listing process could take around three
weeks, but the exchange is unlikely to be opened next month
because this is too close to the holiday season.
</P>
<P>
The most likely date is now early 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
TOL's legal services manager, Lau Masha, said the company's
prospectus includes an ambitious expansion program involving
mineral water, industrial gases and carbon dioxide.
</P>
<P>
"For TOL, going onto the exchange, we're looking to raise
capital for the expansion project," Masha said. He declined to
give details of how much money TOL is hoping to raise.
</P>
<P>
TOL's sales turnover in 1996 was 2.7 billion shillings (about
4.3 million US dollars), up from 2.4 billion in 1995, he said.
</P>
<P>
Kibola said that after TOL, the next company likely to trade
on the exchange would likely be Tanzania Breweries Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The third and fourth companies expected to be listed are
Tanzania Cigarette Company and Agip Tanzania Ltd, he said.

SHIJIAZHUANG, November 19 (Xinhua) -- The city of Baoding in
north China's Hebei province, which is mainly populated by
farmers, has made 30 million U.S. dollars in exporting farm and

Since the beginning of this year, the city's agriculture sector

enterprises to form 20 conglomerates which can handle most of the
city's export business. These conglomerates achieved a trade
volume of five billion yuan in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' GNP Up by 2.5-3 Percent This Year: IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 21 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) predicts an economic growth of only 2.5 to 3.0 percent in
the Philippines this year, far below the government's adjusted
target of 5.5 to 6.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Manila Times today quoted a 12-page report of an IMF team
which reviewed the country's recent economic performance last week
as saying that the IMF was scaling down its projection for the
country's gross national product (GNP) due to the currency crisis
and surging interest rates.
</P>
<P>
For next year, the IMF team sees the growth rate at 4.0 to 4.5
percent, again below the government's projected target of 6.5
percent, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF team pointed out, however, that its growth estimates
for the Philippines are still higher than projections for other
Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the IMF expects Thailand to grow by only 1.5
percent this year and Indonesia by 2.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
GNP, a measure of economic output, is the sum of goods and
services produced by a country's nationals, including
contributions from citizens working overseas.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines last year posted a GNP growth rate of 6.8
percent, the strongest economic performance since 1988.
</P>
<P>
Government planners originally hoped the economy will grow by
seven to eight percent this year. They had to scale down the
target to only 5.5 to 6.0 percent after a region-wide currency
meltdown resulted in massive outflow of funds and surging interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
There were signs of a slowdown even before the crisis gripped
the region in July. The GNP in the first half of the year grew by
only 5.9 percent compared to 7.5 percent in the same period last
year.

Berger, as if to underscore that the United States is not yet
ready to ease its vigilance over the weapons inspection crisis,

reinforced and U-2 spy planes will continue their mission for

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today asked religious leaders to help overcome racial problems.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, at a White House breakfast with about 130 religious
leaders and theologians of various faiths, urged Americans today
to prepare for the day that the nation has no single race as a
majority.
</P>
<P>
The president said the nation faces a dire future if it turns a
blind eye to its growing, diverse population and fails to deal
with racial divisions.
</P>
<P>
Clinton called on churches to draw Americans into his year-long
national dialogue on race beginning December 3 with a town hall
meeting in Akron, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
"America has become markedly more diverse racially, and that
means we're becoming markedly more diverse culturally, and in
religious terms as well," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said that one state, Hawaii, already has no racial
group as a majority, and within a few years, California, the
country's biggest state with 13 percent of its population, will
follow. The nation will not have a white majority within probably
50 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We'd best be ready," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said there are still "racial disparities" in the United
States in the credit practices of banks, in the access to higher
education, and in the earnings in workplace.
</P>
<P>
He said, "It is clear that our attempt to keep making progress
toward the American dream requires us to make progress on the
issues of race and all those that are related."
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "We started with a Constitution that we couldn't
live up to."
</P>
<P>
"And our whole life as a nation has been an effort punctuated
by crisis after crisis after crisis to move our collective life
closer to where we said we believed in over 200 years ago," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Afro-American Museum Considers Displaying Burned Cross </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Bureau of
Investigation has joined the state investigation into who put a
charred cross on the grounds of the National Afro-American Museum
and Cultural Center in Wilberforce, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
Museum officials are considering putting the 5-foot wooden
cross on display at the museum. Discovered Tuesday morning, the
cross was scrawled with racial slurs, "KKK" and a swastika. It was
slightly charred on the back and there was a smell of kerosene in
the air.
</P>
<P>
"(People) think those kinds of things happened in the Stone Age
and they could never happen again," The Associated Press quoted
museum spokesman Michael Sampson saying.
</P>
<P>
An FBI agent joined the state Highway Patrol's investigation
because of a possible civil rights violation.
</P>
<P>
The museum, which opened in 1988, was chartered by Congress
with a goal of educating visitors about black history and culture.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, a man was arrested and accused of plotting to bomb the
museum on Martin Luther King Day.
</P>
<P>
The museum is located on the old campus of Wilberforce
University, 20 miles east of Dayton.

<HEADLINE> US to Send Air Expeditionary Force to Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
sending more warplanes to the Gulf this weekend as still another
reinforcement even after Iraq has agreed to allow U.N. weapons
inspectors including Americans back to resume their work, Pentagon
officials said today.
</P>
<P>
Twelve F-15 fighters, 18 F-16 fighters and two B-1 bombers, to
form an air expeditionary force, will be dispatched to Bahrain,
where an air base will be used for their operation.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied with the air expeditionary force will be four
KC-135 aerial refueling planes.
</P>
<P>
Six F-117a stealth fighters and six B-52 bombers have left
their Air Force bases in the United States and will arrive at
their separate destinations in Kuwait and the Indian Ocean island
of Diego Garcia today.
</P>
<P>
The continuing build-up will bring U.S. air and naval forces in
the Gulf to more than 300 warplanes and 22 warships.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton earlier in the week ordered the F-117a
stealth fighters and B-52 bombers to the Gulf and authorized
Commander Anthony Zinni to form an additional air expeditionary
force to the Gulf if necessary.
</P>
<P>
And Zinni decided it was necessary to send the additional
aircraft as an air expeditionary force to the region. Defense
Secretary William Cohen signed the order for deployment of the
expeditionary force.
</P>
<P>
The United States also decided to send additional Patriot
anti-aircraft missile launchers to Bahrain to protect the air
expeditionary force with 32 warplanes.
</P>
<P>
Army Col. Richard Bridges, a Pentagon spokesman, said the
additional firing unit would be added to a Patriot battery already
stationed in Bahrain. The missiles could be used to intercept any
Scud missiles fired by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Washington is wary of Iraq's decision to let American weapons
inspectors back to Baghdad to resume their work and adopted a
"wait and see" attitude toward Iraq's next step if it acts on its
words.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said it was not enough to just make a statement on the
resumption of the weapons inspections. "We will wait and see," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The United States must remain and will remain resolute in our
determination to prevent him from threatening his neighbors of the
world with nuclear, chemical or biological weapons," the president
said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton's Security Advisor Samuel Berger said the United States
would not be bound by any agreements between the Iraqis and
Russians who had persuaded the Iraqis to agree in allowing weapons
inspectors back for their work.

<HEADLINE> European Shares Surge on Wall Street, Tokyo Rebound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Leading stock markets in
Europe surged strongly Thursday and all ended sharply
higher, supported by Wall Street's rise and Tokyo's revival
as well as a steady dollar.
</P>
<P>
London's FTSE 100 index extended early gains as Wall
Street started the day with a rally and breached the key
4,900-point level once again to close at 4,908.4, up 78.3
points.
</P>
<P>
Both London and Wall Street were heartened by the
Nikkei's bullish performance overnight after hopes that
Japan will bail out its troubled banking sector.
</P>
<P>
Latest UK money supply and GDP figures did little to
heighten or dispel fears about further interest rate rises.
</P>
<P>
The market was also boosted by renewed bid talk in the
bank sector.
</P>
<P>
German shares in Frankfurt closed the day with solid
gains thanks to steadier Far Eastern markets. Share prices
were reassured by the Bundesbank's decision to leave key
German interest rates unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The DAX-30 index ended the session 81.12 points higher at
3,915.94.
</P>
<P>
On the Paris bourse, the CAC-40 index closed 30.63 points
up at 2,821.19. Overnight gains in the U.S. and Japan offset
renewed worries stemming from a further slump in Hong
Kong.

<HEADLINE> Iraq: Arms Inspectors Can Return to Iraq Immediately </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Ambassador to the
United Nations Nizar Hamdoon today informed the Security Council
that all the arms inspectors can return to Iraq and resume their
work immediately.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Hamdoon said, " We think that the
crisis is over. Today I delivered to the President of the
Security Council the decision of the Government of Iraq to
invite the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) back in
its usual work, its usual teams and start working, effective today."
</P>
<P>
"We have invited the UNSCOM and its entire membership,
including Americans," he added.
</P>
<P>
The standoff between the United Nations and Iraq began on
October 29 when Iraq ordered to expel six American members of
UNSCOM in the country, which led to the pulling out of its
weapons teams.
</P>
<P>
Hamdoon said, "We hope that there will be a better climate
now for more cooperative relations between Iraq and the UNSCOM
people."
</P>
<P>
Asked about what has caused Iraq to make such a decision,
Hamdoon said, "The Russians committed themselves to work hard on
the weapons files that have to do with the UNSCOM work and
therefore for the lifting of the sanctions."
</P>
<P>
He denied that the threat of American military buildup in the
Gulf area affected Iraqi decision-making.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Jobs Summit Gives EU Another Tough Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU),
which has been devoted to the integration of European countries to
create a stronger Europe, has been given another chance by the
ongoing EU jobs summit to see how tough a job it is doing.
</P>
<P>
The heads of state and government of EU member countries, who
arrived here today to discuss joint actions to deal with the
challenging issue of unemployment in Europe, should and must
realize that they are also representatives of different EU member
countries.
</P>
<P>
Germany seemed to be the first one to break the harmonious tune
orchestrated by the EU's executive body, the European Commission,
which has proposed "verifiable and quantifiable" EU-wide targets
for curbing the serious unemployment problem.
</P>
<P>
It has given the impression that it believes the jobs summit is
virtually a luxury by saying that employment policy must remain
the responsibility of national governments.
</P>
<P>
But France is trying to explain its different logic behind its
insistence that the issue of unemployment be put high on the EU's
agenda.
</P>
<P>
Paris argues that the ordinary people want to improve their
lives in the first place, after which they might be able to give a
thought to the Bonn-advocated monetary discipline in the future
European single currency.
</P>
<P>
The problem also lies in the fact that Germany and France are
not holding firmly alone in their respective stands. Instead they
are being followed each by differing groups of EU countries, which
also have their national interests in mind, if there is one thing
for certain about the EU.
</P>
<P>
With some 18 million people in the EU listed as unemployed, the
heads of state and government haven't got too much time to differ
on the issue of employment and other ones, with less than six
months to go before the EU decides on which nations will be chosen
to launch the euro.
</P>
<P>
They came to the two-day extraordinary Council of Europe
meeting to seek agreement on dealing with the issue though there
seemed to be little agreement they could reach. And there seems
little chance that most of EU citizens, who would rather stay home
jobless, will be encouraged to leave their countries for work.
</P>
<P>
Thus has posed the most challenging issue to Jacques Santer,
president of the European Commission, who always calls for joint
actions by different EU countries to solve the problem of
unemployment, which has hardly increased during the past two
decades.
</P>
<P>
It is quite possible that Santer wants to tackle the issue
within the framework of a United States of Europe, though
different EU countries are just intent on solving their different
problems in their own ways with the support or aid given by
European institutions.
</P>
<P>
Spain, with Europe's highest jobless rate but also the most
fruitful achievement in creating jobs, attended the jobs summit
with a particular interest of its own.
</P>
<P>
The Spanish government, which has declared 1997 as the "year of
employment," succeeded in getting both employers and unions to
agree to a labor law which restricts the country's generous system
of "payoffs for layoffs."
</P>
<P>
Padraig Flynn, EU commissioner for social affairs and
employment, told reporters today that they had to take action to
deal with the problem and that he was "optimistic" about the
prospects of employment in Europe. But he was in too much a hurry
to explain why.

<HEADLINE> Britain Tries Tagging on Early Released Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The British government
announced plans today to let some short-sentenced criminals out of
jail early provided they agree to wear electronic tags.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Jack Straw said some 6,000 short-term
prisoners would be electronically tagged after being released from
jail two months early.
</P>
<P>
The move was aimed at curbing a rocketing prison population, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The number of prisoners in British jails has risen from 3,400
to 63,000 since the new Labor government took power in May, a
figure twice as much as the government had anticipated.
</P>
<P>
The early released prisoners would be tagged for the rest of
their sentence, and required to spend at least nine hours a day at
home, Straw said in a statement to the parliament.
</P>
<P>
"The case for introducing an element of tagging into the last
part of a short-term prison sentence is...very strong in any
event," he added.
</P>
<P>
The previous Conservative government had already introduced
trials in three areas of the country to allow courts to impose a
new penalty of a curfew order enforced by electronic monitoring as
an alternative to jail or a fine. Straw announced he was extending
this trial to four new areas.

WASHINGTON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen said on Thursday that he saw no need to dispatch
more military reinforcement to the Persian Gulf region after a
32-warplane air expeditionary force was announced to go to the
region.
</P>
<P>
"After today I would not see the need for additional aircraft
or assets unless the commander-in-chief of Central Command
should require it," Cohen said after paying a courtesy call to
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
Pentagon officials said earlier that the air expeditionary
force, formed with 12 F-15 fighters, 18 F-16 fighters and two
B-1 bombers, would be sending to Bahrain this weekend.

<P>
There would also be four KC-135 aerial refueling planes to

Six F-117a stealth fighters and six B-52 bombers have left
their Air Force bases in the United States and will arrive in

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Tumbles to Four-Month Lows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The settlement of the
Iraq-U.S. military confrontation pushed crude oil futures tumbled
today to four-month lows on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Iraq agreed to allow American weapon
inspectors back into the country, apparently averting a military
conflict that could have halted the flow of oil.
</P>
<P>
Gasoline, heating oil and natural gas futures also fell sharply.
</P>
<P>
December crude settled 64 cents lower at 19.16 U.S. dollars a
barrel, after falling as low as 19.05 U.S. dollars, the lowest
since July 22; December unleaded gasoline fell 1.43 cents to 57.22
cents a gallon; December heating oil fell 1.22 cents to 55.45
cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
Traders were speculating that the U.N. oil-for-food plan for
Iraq would allow Iraq to export 3 billion U.S. dollars in oil over
six months, up from 2 billion U.S. dollars previously.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) also
is meeting next week in Indonesia, and Saudi Arabia, one of the
world's largest exporters, already has signaled it will seek to
significantly boost daily export quotas, according to market
sources.
</P>
<P>
Natural gas futures also fell sharply as long-range forecasts
for above-normal temperatures in major U.S. heating regions raised
expectations inventories in storage will be able to meet winter
demand. December natural gas fell 15.3 cents to 2.708 U.S. dollars
for each 1,000 cubic feet.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Indicates Pause of Sending More Forces to Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen said here today that he anticipates no need to send
more "military assets" to the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
"After today I would not see the need for additional aircraft
or assets unless the commander-in-chief of Central Command should
require it," he told reporters after a brief meeting with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
He said there have been additional aircraft sent to the region
in recent days, which would represent "a sufficient complement"
of the United States in the region for the time being.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. forces will stay as long as there is full
compliance with the U.N. resolutions on the part of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has increased its military presence in the region to
keep pressure on Iraq for its cooperation with the U.N. in
inspecting its weapons.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said one reason for U.S. forces to stay there is the
movement of Iraq's surface missiles which could threaten U.S. U-2
aircraft flown over Iraq on a U.N. banner.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the possibility of allowing Iraq to sell more oil
for additional humanitarian relief, Cohen said ways to help
alleviate Iraqi people's sufferings can only be explored when
there is full compliance with relevant U.N. resolutions by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said it is not because Iraqi President Saddam Hussein is
in power that the U.S. does not agree to lift sanctions on Iraq ,
but it is because Iraq possesses chemical and biological weapons
discovered by U.N. inspectors.

<P>
NEW YORK, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar fell against
the Japanese yen but rose against the German mark Thursday on
profit taking from the yen's recent weakness and cheered news that
Japan may use public funds to help troubled banks.
</P>
<P>
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 126.03 yen,
down from 127 late Wednesday. The dollar also was changing hands at
1.7413 marks, up from 1.7318.
</P>
<P>
In addition to profit-taking, the yen rallied after Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto instructed the government to start
discussing the use of public funds to stabilize Japan's ailing
financial system.
</P>
<P>
Just one day ago, there was a reversal news that indicated the
Japanese government would not use public funds to help the
domestic banks, which sent Japanese yen lower and stocks plunging.
</P>
<P>
Traders also bought yen Thursday after both the United States
and Japan reported big trade surplus in October that could cause
friction between the governments regarding foreign exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late
Wednesday: 1.4125 Swiss francs, up from 1.4034; 5.8285 French

nations as much as 40 billion U.S. dollars annually.
</P>
<P>
"Telemarketing fraud has become one of the most pervasive and
problematic forms of white-collar crime in Canada and the United
States," said a report prepared for President Bill Clinton and
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien.
</P>
<P>
"Senior citizens in both countries are overrepresented among
victims and offenders have admitted to targeting them
specifically," the report noted. "The evidence indicates that
offenders believe older people have more assets and are more
susceptible to techniques such as excitement tactics or appeals to
altruism."
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the report said, the use of telephones has
enabled criminals to target victims at long distances and across
provincial, state and international borders, making binational
cooperation particularly important.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Chretien discussed the problem during their April 8
summit and ordered a group to study ways to address it. The group
included law enforcement and policy officials from both federal
governments and state and provincial agencies.
</P>
<P>
Specific recommendations included exploring the legal and
technical potential and limits of electronic surveillance and
examining the possibility of denying telephone services to
offenders.
</P>
<P>
The report also suggested examination of extradition
arrangements and a review of deportation laws that might apply to
foreign nationals engaging in telemarketing fraud.

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today
approved a 15 million U.S. dollar equivalent credit which will be
used to strengthen and improve financing and management reform of
Armenia's education sector.
</P>
<P>
The project is designed to fund the full implementation of the
new strategy for textbook provision, assist in targeting funds and
capacity building and support institutional policy development and
management.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank credit, which will be channeled through the
International Development Association (IDA), the concessionary
lending arm for developing countries, would finance about 63
percent of the project cost of 23.9 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Since Armenia joined the World Bank in 1992, and IDA in 1993,
IDA commitments total approximately 300 million dollars for 12
projects.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Endorses Patient Rights Recommendation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- In a most sweeping health
care reform effort since 1994, U.S. President Bill Clinton today
voiced support to a wide-ranging patient "bill of rights" proposed
by a 34-member presidential commission.
</P>
<P>
Clinton urged Congress to enact the reform proposals and called
on private industry to observe them.
</P>
<P>
The reforms require health plans to pay for emergency room
visits, to provide full information on their doctors and financial
incentives, and to accept outside appeal procedures for various
grievances.
</P>
<P>
The measures also give patients the right to consult enough
doctors to avoid unreasonable waits, to stay with the same doctor
when forced to switch health plans, and to keep their medical
records private.
</P>
<P>
Administration officials said the proposals -- a "bill of
rights" for patients -- will be implemented through the
accreditation process, voluntary compliance or, where necessary,
by legislation
</P>
<P>
Clinton acknowledged the reforms are part of an effort to
enact partial health care reform following his 1994 defeat on a
comprehensive plan.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said, "While people may not have wanted to bite the
whole apple at once in 1994, almost the whole populace wants to
keep nibbling away at the apple until we actually have solved the
problems of cost, accessibility and quality for all responsible
American citizens."
</P>
<P>
The recommended plan is expected to meet potential opposition
from business and congressional conservatives in enacting key
elements which they say will increase health care costs for
employers, although Clinton said many corporate leaders support
the commission's report.

<HEADLINE> APEC Officials Continues Meeting on Free Trade, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VANCOUVER, Canada, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials
from 18 economies of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)
forum today met for a second day, focusing on economic technical
cooperation and selection of sectors for early liberalization.
</P>
<P>
The officials are making their last ditch of efforts in
preparing a final document for a ministerial meeting scheduled on
Friday and Saturday, which is followed by an informal meeting of
APEC leaders next week.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will decide how to strengthen the economic
technical cooperation among the members and attempt to identify
priority sectors among the 41 proposals which the senior officials
came up with at their last meeting in Singapore in October.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the officials spent a whole day discussing the
agendas and a number of preparatory documents for the ministerial
meeting.
</P>
<P>
"Consequently in this meeting, we don't intend to take on any
of the decision-making or complex policy discussions that the
ministers will have during the weekend," a senior Canadian
official told reporters Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The officials focused on three "substantive issues", including
the early voluntary sectoral liberalization, the infrastructure
cooperation and the sustainable development, he said.
</P>
<P>
The participants have agreed to narrow the selection of the
sectors from 41 to less than 20 proposals and they will continue
discussion on this subject.
</P>
<P>
However, other sources said that the officials are now focusing
on 15 proposals. Each proposal does not necessarily mean
liberalization in one product sector.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, APEC leaders agreed in Subic Bay of the Philipines
that ministers will identify sectors where early voluntary
liberalization would have a positive impact on trade, investment
and economic growth and submit recommendations to the leaders.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian official noted that Canada pursued a number of
priorities in early liberalization sectors ranging from primary
and manufactured goods.
</P>
<P>
"We have been in forefront efforts to identify fishery sector,
wood product, oil seeds and primary product material," he said.
</P>
<P>
APEC members have not reached consensus on a single sector so
far because many are expected to protect their interests in
sensitive sectors.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that fairly broad support have been shown for
early voluntary liberalization in toys, chemicals, and
environmental goods and services.
</P>
<P>
They said that sectors included in the 15 proposals will be
divided into three stages for early liberalization.
</P>
<P>
On the economic technical cooperation, the officials examined
the issue of possible mechanism, and "will probably be proposing a
sub-committee of the senior officials," the Canadian official
said.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis in South East Asia was another major
subject for the discussions.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, deputy finance ministers from Asia and the U.S.,
along with top officials from the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) agreed to a framework for regional cooperation to promote
financial stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, the Canadian official said, was "greeted with a
good deal of pleasure by officials here" and send a strong,
confidence-building message about liveralizing trade, but it still
needs to be studied.
</P>
<P>
The APEC, which was initiated in 1989, now groups Australia,
Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, China, China's Hong Kong,
Indonesia, Republic of Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Papua
New Guinea, Philipines, Singapore, Chinese Taipei, Thailand and
the United States.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Call on Passing 1998 Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 20 (Xinhua) -- President Boris Yeltsin on
Thursday afternoon called on the State Duma to pass the 1998 draft
budget, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In a televised interview Yeltsin said "I request the State Duma
deputies and Speaker Gennady Seleznyov to pass the budget and
close this item of the agenda."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin hopes that the newly-appointed Finance Minister Mikhail
Zadornov, also Duma Budgetary Committee Chairman, will attend "to
the financial weak points in the government's operation."
</P>
<P>
The State Duma threatened that the passage of the 1998 budget
would be linked with the controversial 450,000 US dollars book
deal, which were involved five top governmental officials,
including Anatoly Chubais, the First Deputy Prime Minister and
Finance Minister.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president said he had decided that First Deputy
Prime Ministers Anatoly Chubais and Boris Nemtsov would not also
head ministries.
</P>
<P>
Another report said, Yeltsin on Thursday appointed Viktoriya
Mitina deputy head of the presidential administration.
</P>
<P>
Mitina's predecessor was Alexander Kazakov, who was one of the
writers of the book on Russian privatization and dismissed by the
president on November 14.
</P>
<P>
Mitina was graduated from the Moscow Institute of Electronic
Technology in 1972, and was first deputy chairperson of the
Zelenograd Soviet in 1990-1991.
</P>
<P>
Mitina has been deputy prefect of Zelenograd Administrative
Area in Moscow in charge of science, industry, entrepreneurship,
land relations, media and political and interest groups.
</P>
<P>
She campaigned for Boris Yeltsin in all elections since 1989,
from the USSR Supreme Soviet to presidential elections in 1991 and
1996.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Yeltsin also signed a decree appointing
Sergei Kiriyenko Fuel and Energy Minister. He was the First Deputy
of the ministry.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today the president removed Anatoly Chubais from the
post of Finance Minister and appointed Mikhail Zadornov to the
post. Chubais, who was involved in a scandal relating a high
payment for a book on Russian privatization, remains the first
deputy prime minister.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls on International Support for African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 20 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today called on the international community to give
political, technical and financial support to Africa's industrial
development.
</P>
<P>
speaking on the occasion of the Africa industrialization Day,
November 20, Annan said industrial development is a key element of
sustainable economic growth. It helps countries to achieve
important social objectives, such as jobs and equity. It creates
opportunities for the integration of women. It helps to stem
migration and relieve pressure on cities.
</P>
<P>
Annan said with industrial development, the continent can take
decisive steps towards full-throttle competition in the global
marketplace. But without it, African economies will be condemned
to persistent crisis, dependence on humanitarian relief and
deepening poverty, despair and political unrest.
</P>
<P>
Annan said this year's Africa industrialization Day focuses on
the development of small-and medium scale industries. Such
enterprises are the backbone of economic activity in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief said in both the formal and informal sectors,
small enterpreneurs play a pivotal role in alleviating poverty and
promoting economic progress. But small-scale industries need
support from Governments and the international community.
</P>
<P>
He said they require a favorable policy environment. They need
to upgrade the skills of their workers, to improve the quality of
their products, to find sources of financing and to gain market
access. They need technology and the requisite physical
infrastructure. They need partners.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the United Nations systems will continue to support
such ventures and promote technical assistance to small-and medium
-scale enterprises, and the industrialization of Africa will
remain one of the top priorities of the United Nations.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Deputy Foreign
 Minister Tian Zengpei left here today for Bahrain to continue his
 tour of the Gulf region.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day stay here, Tian delivered a message to the
 Kuwaiti Amir from Chinese President Jiang Zemin on ways to promote
 bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Tian arrived here Tuesday on the second leg of his Middle East
 trip which had already taken him to Turkey and will also take him
 to Bahrain, Oman and Qatar.
</P>
<P>
He was received by Kuwaiti Amir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed Al-Sabah
 and Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad Al-Abdullah
 Al-Salem Al-Sabah. He held talks with his Kuwaiti counterpart
 Suleiman Majed Al-Shaheen.
</P>
<P>
Tian said before departure that in the message to the Kuwaiti
 Amir, the Chinese president stressed China treasures the long-term
 friendly relations between the two countries and expressed hope
 that a comprehensive cooperative relationship on the basis of
 equality and mutual interest will sustain.
</P>
<P>
He said the Kuwaiti leadership indicated that Kuwait attaches
 great importance to its ties with China and the two countries have
 the same or similar views on a wide range of international and
 regional issues.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti side hoped bilateral relations will be further
 developed in political, economic and many other fields.
</P>
<P>

 boosting bilateral relations and signed a Memorandum of
 Understanding on bilateral consultations between the two foreign
 ministries.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Stock market in Record Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
HARARE, November 20 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's stock market,the
 second largest stock market in Africa, today continued its
 free-fall when it lost a 668.51 points, in a record single day
 plunge, on the back of waning investor's confidence about the
 future of the economy.
</P>
<P>
Stockbrokers reiterated that the panic on the local bourse was
 a result of uncertainty over the huge payments to be made to
 former freedom veterans by the government, the threat of
 nationalisation of commercial farms for resettlement of landless
 peasants and last week's sharp devaluation of the Zimbabwe
 Dollar.
</P>
<P>
The industrial index, which is the country's economic
 barometer, fell by another all time record of 500 points on
 Wednesday. It now stands at 8,457.99.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said although the government had taken measures to
 arrest the drop in the local currency, resumption of the balance
 of payments support from the International Monetary Fund is
 crucial to further stabilize the dollar.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: U.S. to "Wait and See" Iraq's Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
WASHINGTON, November 20 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton,
 wary of Iraq's permission to allow U.N. weapons inspectors
 including Americans back on their work, said on Thursday that he
 will "wait and see" Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's next
 action.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's Revolutionary Command Council earlier issued a
 statement, saying "Iraq has accepted the return of U.N. Special
 Commission (UNSCOM) inspectors, including the Americans," to
 Baghdad and resume their work.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said it was not enough to just make a statement by
 Saddam Hussein, "We will wait and see" if he does what he says, he
 emphasized.
</P>
<P>
"The United States must remain and will remain resolute in
 our determination to prevent him from threatening his neighbors
 of the world with nuclear, chemical or biological weapons," the
 president said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the White House welcomed Iraq's decision to reverse
 his ban on American weapons inspectors, saying it was "an
 encouraging development."
</P>
<P>
But the statement "must ultimately be tested by what Saddam
 Hussein does," White House spokeswoman Anne Luzzatto said. "We
 have to see how it unfolds."
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, now in Geneva
 attending an emergency meeting with four other permanent members
 of U.N. Security Council on the weapons inspection crisis,
 called Iraq's decision "a step in the right direction."
</P>
<P>
"It's the secretary's view that the announcement out of
 Baghdad is a step in the right direction," said State Department
 spokesman James Rubin, who is accompanying Albright on her world
 travel.
</P>
<P>
"Our objective was to see the unconditional return of the
 U.N. inspectors. Our strategy was to combine intensive
 diplomacy, that is the unity of the major powers, with a robust
 military posture and if the inspectors return, then our
 objectives will have been met," he said.
