<HEADLINE> Lebanon Refuses Entry of Greenpeace's Ship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 8 (Xinhua) -- A Greenpeace spokesman said this
morning that Lebanon had refused to give permission to the Arctic
Sunrise, one of the organization's ships, to enter the country.
</P>
<P>
"Authorities in Beirut have denied permission for a Greenpeace
ship to visit Lebanon. No official reason was given," Fouad
Hamdan, Greenpeace's Mediterranean spokesman, said in a statement
published in the Lebanese capital of Beirut this morning.
</P>
<P>
The ship carrying environmental activists was set to arrive at
Beirut Port Thursday for a six-day visit to Lebanon in order "to
spread awareness on ecological issues in the Mediterranean and in
this country," Hamdan said.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanese Minister of Environment Pierre Pharaon told us
during a meeting on September 24 that he will use all his powers
to prevent the ship's visit. The minister blamed Greenpeace for
raising, during the past two years, the issue of Italian toxic
waste in Lebanon," the Greenpeace spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
However, the Lebanese minister said he had expressed
reservations about the Arctic Sunrise's visit but he could not
"personally" take the decision to bar its entry.
</P>
<P>
The minister was quoted by Beirut's leftist daily As-Safir as
saying today that he did "not feel comfortable on the positions
of the organization toward Lebanon in the past because they were
negative positions."
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace has repeatedly criticized the Lebanese government
for failing to process in time toxic waste dumped by some Italian
companies in this country during the 1975-90 civil war.
</P>
<P>
In September 1995, Lebanese authorities forced the Greenpeace
ship Altair to leave Beirut, preventing the ship from giving more
information on the scandal about the Italian industrial waste.
</P>
<P>
Hamdan said the scandal was resolved in October 1995 when the
Lebanese authorities collected 77 tons of toxic waste and
contaminated earth and shipped them to Europe in 12 containers.
</P>
<P>
"I expressed my reservations on the visit of the Greenpeace
ship, because I do not know how to deal with them," the Lebanese
minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Recalling his experience with Greenpeace, the minister said,
"We make agreement on things and then they change their ideas,
and we do not know what they want."
</P>
<P>
"We are trying to keep the interests of Lebanon, we have plans
on the wastes and we also have difficulties," he added.
</P>
<P>
"There are other places where the organization can go and let
it go to other countries," he said. "Lebanon is not a garbage can
which could be used for opening struggles on its land."

<HEADLINE> 213 Major Disasters in 1995, Affecting 300 Million People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- There were 213 major natural
disasters in 1995, affecting over 300 million people and causing
at least 150 billion U.S. dollars of economic losses, the
International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR) today.
</P>
<P>
The figure was based on data from the insurance industry,
excluding drought-related losses, and was therefore greatly
underestimated, IDNDR said.
</P>
<P>
The World Meteorological Organization put the estimate at
around 180 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
IDNDR Director of Secretariat Olavi Elo said at a news
conference that natural disasters have been rising over recent
years in both scale and number. Statistics showed an annual growth
of 6 percent in the number of people affected by disasters since
1960.
</P>
<P>
Among the disasters, flooding, compared to typhoons,
earthquakes, hurricanes and volcano eruptions, affected most
people and caused the severest damages, and was now most frequent
and most urban-related.
</P>
<P>
In a news release issued on the eve of the International Day
for Natural Disaster Reduction, which falls on Wednesday with the
theme of "Cities At Risk" this year, IDNDR blamed urbanization for
the increase in flooding.
</P>
<P>
Elo voiced concern over the rapid urbanization worldwide and
the growing vulnerability of cities to disasters.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, he said, more than 100 cities would each have
a population above 2 million, adding that 500 million people would
live in volcanic areas, while volcano eruptions being likely to
number 50 per year.
</P>
<P>
"Already at least one-quarter of the people on earth live in
high-risk areas and their number is growing rapidly," Elo said.
</P>
<P>
"The high density of population in slums and squatter
settlements in developing world cities, the use of hazardous
ground, such as unstable slopes, reclaimed land, ravines and river
banks, the concentration of poorly-constructed and
badly-maintained buildings are a recipe for urban disaster," Elo
said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the year 2025, 80 percent of the
earth's urban areas would lie in the developing world, with a high
concentration of poor families, which had no alternative but to
occupy the hazard-prone regions in and around the cities.
</P>
<P>
The poor were the least-protected and suffered the most, Elo
told reporters.

<HEADLINE> Chernomyrdin Says Chechnya Remains Part of Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin said today the government would not consider granting
full independence to the breakaway republic of Chechnya and that
the conflict was Russia's "internal affair."
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Federation Council, parliament's upper house,
Chernomyrdin stressed that Russia's territorial integrity, the
inviolability of its external frontiers and internal borders, and
the operation of the constitution could not be the subject of
bargaining at any level and any stage.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin made the remarks when deputies of the Federation
Council, which groups influential Russian regional leaders, raised
fears that a peace treaty signed by security chief Alexander Lebed
and Chechen rebels on August 31 would leave the separatists in
control of the republic.
</P>
<P>
The agreement deferred any decision on Chechnya's independence
for five years.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin praised the deal and said it had led to the most
important result - the end of the 21-month war. He said that
attacks on the agreement by Interior Minister Anatoly Kulikov last
week "remain on his conscience."
</P>
<P>
Kulikov described the peace deal as a humiliating step towards
the disintegration of Russia in a speech to the State Duma (lower
house).
</P>
<P>
And at a news briefing on Monday he called into question the
progress of peace in Chechnya and said he would "prove
documentally" that the agreement was "juridically invalid."
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin told the upper house that the agreement was not a
proper legal document.
</P>
<P>
"There have been no agreements on Chechnya... there has been a
framework of political declarations."
</P>
<P>
He said the government's immediate goals for Chechnya are the
demilitarization of the region and functioning of a joint
commission of the federal authorities and separatists'
representatives in a transitional period to prepare for elections.
</P>
<P>
President Boris Yeltsin would make decisions on the Chechen
problem on the basis of the constitution and norms of
international law, "proceeding from people's right to
self-determination and the country's right to integrity," the
prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Outlining the guidelines for further settlement in Chechnya,
Chernomyrdin said the Kremlin's policy would be based on two
principles: the Chechen crisis will be settled within the
framework of peace talks, and the status of Chechnya will be
determined according to the interests of the Chechen people and
Russia as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The premier said the Kremlin's main goal was to reach an
agreement on power-sharing between the federal authorities and the
Chechen republic in a regional administration.

<HEADLINE> Imports Threaten UK Car Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Imported cars accounted for
nearly two-thirds of the new cars sold in Britain in September,
according to figures released by the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) Monday.
</P>
<P>
The SMMT said that the share of September's market taken by
imports soared to 64.7 percent, one of the highest figures
recorded by the industry for a single month.
</P>
<P>
Import penetration for the first three quarters of the year as
a whole, at 62.3 percent, is also running at an exceptionally high
level.
</P>
<P>
Surging sales by the Volkswagen group, Fiat and South Korean
makers were mainly responsible for the ever-rising tide of
imports, the SMMT said.
</P>
<P>
The SMMT figures showed that imports last month rose by 7.7
percent, to 89,331, in a total new car market down 1.4 percent,
year-on-year, to 138,059 from 140,069.
</P>
<P>
For the first three quarters of the year as a whole, imports
rose by 8.3 percent, to 1,032,674 from 953,341, in a total market
of 1,657,234.
</P>
<P>
While market shares of Ford, Vauxhaul and Rover fell last
month, the Volkswagen group increased 40 percent, Fiat 35 percent
and South Korean makers 37 percent.

<HEADLINE> Russia Welcomes France's Proposal on Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said today Moscow agreed with France's proposal for a
summit in mid-1997 to discuss "the transformation of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the establishment of
special relations with Russia."
</P>
<P>
After talks with visiting French Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette, Primakov told reporters that "NATO can and must play an
important role in European security, but it cannot be the pivotal
organization which assumes absolutely all functions necessary for
security on the continent."
</P>
<P>
Primakov said the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE), which will hold a summit in Lisbon in December,
should play a key role in European security.
</P>
<P>
But he welcomed de Charette's proposal for a top-level meeting
in mid-1997 to adjust the NATO military alliance toward special
relations with Russia.
</P>
<P>
"Such an emphasis is beneficial and we will work hard on the
issue," Primakov.
</P>
<P>
But the Russian minister did not specify what kind of document
might be signed at the end of the proposed summit. Russia and some
other countries still have different approaches to the issue,
diplomats here say.
</P>
<P>
De Charette said France was determined to adapt the existing
security organizations, whether reinforcing the OSCE, updating the
Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty or renewing NATO.

<HEADLINE> Chang Advances in Beijing Open Tennis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 8 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Top seed Michael Chang
stemmed the exodus of big names, brushing aside Nicolas Pereira of
Venezuela in straight sets to take the first step toward his
straight fourth title in the Beijing Open tennis tournament on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The World No. 2 American, who has won the ATP Tour event all
three times it has been played, needed 62 minutes to see off
Pereira 6-1, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Following in the footsteps of sixth seed Patrick Rafter of
Australia, who was eliminated on Monday in the first round,
second-seeded Todd Woodbridge of Australia lost to unseeded
Frenchman Jean-Philippe Fleurian 6-2, 6-3. Former world No. 1 Mats
Wilander of Sweden, a wild-card entrant in the event, also failed
to find enough fortune, succumbing to Martin Damm of Czech 6-4,
6-3.
</P>
<P>
World ranked 98th Pereira posed no match to Chang in ability
and accuracy, conceding the first set in only 23 minutes.
</P>
<P>
But he staged stiff comeback in the second set, breaking Chang
in the eighth game and holding his own at love in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
That, however, proved to be a flash in the pan as Chang
regained his composure in the tenth game and served his way out of
the match.
</P>
<P>
Chang, who put behind his shock defeat by his American fellow
Jonathan Stark in the Singapore Open last week, exuded confidence
after his win.
</P>
<P>
"My best time is still ahead, I will try my best," he said.
</P>
<P>
But that is not the case with Wilander. The former No. 1
obviously felt the ravages of time.
</P>
<P>
"If you are one tenth second slower, it make much difference,"
Wilander said.

<P>
HARARE, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's first lady Grace
Mugabe said here today that there is need for strong government
policies designed to promote the cultural, political, economic
and legal status of Zimbawean women.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening a one-day symposium to commemorate the
World Mental Health Day, Grace Mugabe said that to reduce the
impact of problems associated with mental health, there is also
need to strengthen and build local grassroots movements to resist
oppression, as well as confront all causes of ill health.
</P>
<P>
She called for programs which addressed both women's needs for
economic opportunities and their need to design, staff and
control services, as well as train other women in skills
appropriate to their needs and settings.
</P>
<P>
''The recent drought spells we have experienced in Zimbabwe
have left women suffering from chronic hunger and anxiety," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Health and Child Welfare Deputy Minister Sungirirai Hungwse,
who attended the ceremony, signed a proclamation declaring
October 10 of each year as World Mental Health Day in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The World Federation for Mental Health has designated the day
to increase public awareness and understanding of the mental and
emotional needs of women and the girl child, improve quality of
and access to mental health care for women throughout the world
and develop policies that reduce the negative impact of poverty
and design programs which provide economic opportunities to
women, among others.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Political Parties Predict Large Seat Gains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 8 (Xinhua) -- With the start of the general
election campaign for the House of Representatives, Japan's six
major political parties have come out with their election
platforms and target for seats in the lower house.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), the main party in
the tripartite coalition government, aims to come as close as
possible to winning an outright majority of 251 seats in the
500-member lower house.
</P>
<P>
With the cooperation of its coalition partners, the Social
Democratic Party (SDP) and New Party Sakigake, and helped by
defections from the leading opposition New Frontier Party (NFP),
the LDP expects to establish a stable government under Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who is also leader of the LDP.
</P>
<P>
While both Hashimoto and LDP Secretary General Koichi Kato have
publicly stated their target of an absolute majority in the lower
chamber, most political analysts say winning between 220 and 230
seats would be considered a victory for the LDP.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition NFP has also targeted gaining a majority in
the house -- or at least the largest number of seats -- and select
party leader Ichiro Ozawa as prime minister.
</P>
<P>
It aims to win about one third of the 200 seats to be contested
in proportional representation constituencies and about 200 of the
300 seats to be contested under the single-seat system.
</P>
<P>
Yukio Hatoyama, joint-leader of the new Democratic Party of
Japan (DPJ), has said victory for his party would mean winning 75
seats, a gain on the 52 seats it held before the dissolution of
the lower house on September 27.
</P>
<P>
Hit by retirement and defections to the DPJ, only 14 of the
SDP's incumbent members of the house are running in the election,
a big drop on the 64 seats it held at the time of dissolution.
</P>
<P>
Hoping the return of Takako Doi as party leader will boost the
SDP's declining popularity, the party will be striving to win
seats wherever possible.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Communist Party (JCP) wants to double its number
of seats from its present 15 by gaining support from unaffiliated
non-conservatives disenchanted with the SDP but not lured to the
DPJ.
</P>
<P>
The JCP aims to win 10 seats in urban single-seat
constituencies, such as Tokyo, Osaka and Kyoto, and 20 seats
through proportional representation.
</P>
<P>
New Party Sakigake, the smallest of the six main political
parties, wants to see all its 15 candidates retain their
seats. The party gave up fielding candidates in six proportional
representation constituencies in Tokyo and elsewhere and focused
on single-seat districts.

<HEADLINE> Control of Mercury Use Urged in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 8 (xinhua) --A senior Zimbabwean official
today stressed the need to end the haphazard use of mercury in
the procesing of gold which she blamed for posing a serious
threat to Zimbabwean people's health.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the fourth annual general meeting of the
Non-Governmental Organisation, Environment 2000, Zimbabwean
Deputy Minister of Health and Child Welfare Tsungirirai Hungwe
noted the uncontrolled use of mercury in the processing of gold
by illegal panners resulted in the damage of the central nervous
system and caused respiratory disorders in human beings.
</P>
<P>
''Although mercury and its compounds occur naturally in the
environment, it is their use by people that leads to high local
concentrations,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
''Accidental emissions arising from fossil fuel production,
mining and smelting of mercury ores and other industrial
processes call for urgent attention as they are far more
difficult to estimate and control than releases through
industrial effluents and waste discharges,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Angola Urges Foreign Aid in Mine Sweeping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government today
urged foreign aid on the mine sweeping project in the southern
African country torn by 20 years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
Helder Cruz, director of the National Agency for Removal of
Mines and Explosives, told a press conference that Angola needs
six million U.S. Dollars and 120 experts to completely wipe out
mines and explosives planted in the country during the civil war.
</P>
<P>
He said foreign financial and technical assistance are crucial
since the mines planted in Angola were mainly made in Italy, the
former Soviet Union, Germany, Romania and other East European and
African countries.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of this year, a total of 6,000 mines
have been removed in Angola with the help of experts from the
United Nations and other non-governmental organisations, said the
official, adding that a larger number of mines are yet to be
cleared.

<HEADLINE> News Feature: Japanese Party Leaders Call for Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The leaders of Japan's six main
political parties gave their first campaign speeches today
immediately after the official campaign kicked off for the October
20 general election.
</P>
<P>
The poll to elect the lower House of Representatives is widely
seen as a crucial decider which could transform the nation's
political map.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, staking his nine-month-old
government on the upcoming general election, promised economic
recovery as he made his first official campaign speech at Tokyo's
Asakusa district with a party candidate standing by his side.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, who leads the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP),
the main partner in the tripartite coalition government, told a
gathering of several hundred people that "we will make utmost
efforts to tackle the economy."
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto told the crowd that more government work is needed to
put the Japanese economy back on track and asked voters to back
the LDP's efforts to build a financially secure future for the
economy.
</P>
<P>
"We have to strengthen small businesses and local industries
since unemployment is still high," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a national election which the dream of making Japan
energetic depends on," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,400 people, including 144 women, filed their
candidacies for the race for the decisive lower house, the first
lower chamber election in more than three years.
</P>
<P>
Since the last election, the government has changed hands four
times.
</P>
<P>
The general election, coming nine months ahead of the expiry of
the four-year lower house term, will focus on administrative and
fiscal reforms, the planned consumption tax hike, security
problems and measures to stimulate the economy.
</P>
<P>
Ichiro Ozawa, president of the leading opposition New Frontier
Party (NFP), joined his party's candidate at one Tokyo district in
front of Shibuya station to address the passengers leaving the
station on their way to work.
</P>
<P>
Ozawa reiterated that his party is the only one offering
tangible policy options in this campaign -- a theme he introduced
in Monday's debate with other party leaders.
</P>
<P>
"The debate yesterday made clear that the other parties have no
specific policy positions to offer the Japanese people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Blasting the LDP-led government's plan to raise the consumption
tax from 3 percent to 5 percent from next April, Ozawa, spelled
out his party's campaign platform which includes freezing the
consumption tax at the current rate.
</P>
<P>
Ozawa's NFP is fielding a total of 360 candidates for the
500-member lower house, including 235 in single-seat
constituencies, the LDP is putting up 355 candidates, including
288 in single-seat constituencies, and the new Democratic Party of
Japan (DPJ) 161, including 142 in single-seat constituencies.
</P>
<P>
The two other partners in the ruling coalition are the Social
Democratic Party and New Party Sakigake.
</P>
<P>
The SDP, battling for survival as a mainstream party after
defections to the new DPJ, has 48 candidates and New Party
Sakigake 15. The Japanese Communist Party (JCP) is fielding 321
candidates.

JOHANNESBURG, Ocotber 8 (Xinhua) --South African President
Nelson Mandela has cancelled his official visit to the Phili-
ppines next week because he is still recovering from a knee
surgery.
</P>
<P>
In a statement today, the foreign ministry said that Mandela
has called the Pilipino President, General Fidel Ramos, to cancel
the visit.
</P>
<P>
The 78-year-old President underwent surgery in September to
repair damage to his knee inflected during his 27 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said, accordidng to the foreign ministry, he hopes to
visit the Philippines in the near future, but no exect date is

<TEXT>
<P>
Political analysts said it would be difficult for the LDP or
any other party to win a majority in the new parliament, meaning
another coalition government is likely to be formed after the
election.
</P>
<P>
The first campaign stop for Takako Doi, the Lower House speaker
who was asked to return to lead the SDP, was also a railway
station. At her Yokohama stop, she promised passing commuters that
she would work to keep the flame of democratic politics alive.
</P>
<P>
"We will start anew, with a totally new feeling, in order to
create a political situation that will give hope to workers and
take care of the elderly," she said.
</P>
<P>
The party, which had its election prospects dimmed by several
defections to the DPJ, has seen its public support decline as a
result of policy changes it made.
</P>
<P>
JCP leader Tetsuzo Fuwa and another party candidate also came
to Shibuya station to address commuters.
</P>
<P>
"There is a need to break through the framework of Nagatacho
where all the other political parties are in some sense a part of
the ruling coalition," Fuwa said, referring to the Tokyo district
that is home to the Diet and the headquarters of most of the major
parties.
</P>
<P>
He also criticized the government plan to raise the consumption
tax, saying "the chance has finally arrived to deliver a verdict
on the increase in consumption tax that is violation of (election)
promises."
</P>
<P>
The JCP is aiming at expanding its share of the vote against
the conservative front.
</P>
<P>
DPJ joint leader Naoto Kan said in Osaka that bureaucrats have
been the key players in Japanese politics for too long.
</P>
<P>
The DPJ, inaugurated September 28 mainly with former Sakigake
and SDP members, is hoping to wield political influence after the
race, whether in the ruling camp or in the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto dissolved the Lower House on September 27 in a bid to
strengthen the power of his conservative LDP as well as his own
grip on power by getting a popular mandate.
</P>
<P>
The LDP needs to sharply boost its pre-election strength of 211
if it is to remain in power, partly because its coalition partners
-- the SDP and Sakigake -- face demise as mainstream parties due
to massive defections to the DPJ.
</P>
<P>
The NFP held 160 seats in the Lower House, the DPJ 52, the SDP
30, the JCP 15 and Sakigake nine as the election campaign began.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in front of Nagono railway station, Sakigake head
Shoichi Ide predicted that Japan would enter a new phase of
political realignment after the poll.
</P>
<P>
"We are a small group and face a tough time under the new
electoral system," Ide said. "But we don't want you to put out
(Sakigake's) torch."

<HEADLINE> Mayor of Small French Town Imposes Curfew to Keep </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- A mayor of a small town in
northern France has imposed a curfew banning people from moving
around in big crowds on the roads and in public places after
21:00, reported Agence France Presse today.
</P>
<P>
Paul Sion, mayor of Camphin-en-Carembault, which has a
population of 1,500, said that the reason to impose the curfew is
that some young people often made "nightly uproars" while
listening to music until small hours in the morning.
</P>
<P>
But the ordinance has aroused protest from some local
residents, especially the young.
</P>
<P>
"If there is nightly uproar, there are laws and means to act
without resorting to such a banning which aggresses upon all the
citizens of the town," said Sebastien Courmont, a 21-year-old
student and co-founder of the "Motive/Action" association, which
rivaled with but was defeated by Sion in the local election of
1995.

<HEADLINE> Russian Premier Outlines National Economic Goals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin said today that his cabinet plans to achieve an
annual economic growth of at least 5 percent by the end of the
century.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the first session of the newly-elected Federation
Council, the parliament's upper house, Chernomyrdin briefed its
deputies about the social and economic situation in the country
and the goals of his cabinet in the two fields.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about the drafting of a new economic program for
1997-2000, the premier said that it provides for inflation growth
rates of under 5-8 percent per annum by the end of the century and
a budget deficit of 2 percent of the gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
He added that under the plan conditions would be created to
transfer savings into investments and to check the outflow of
capital abroad.
</P>
<P>
The influx of foreign investments is planned at 10-12 billion
U.S. dollars per annum by the start of the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
"These are quite concrete and, to our mind, realistic
benchmarks," Chernomyrdin said. "Estimating the present economic
situation as a whole, we can claim with certainty that the country
is pulling out of the most difficult phase of the transition
period."
</P>
<P>
As to the present economic situation in the country, the
premier said the rate of consumer price growth will not exceed 1
percent a month until the end of 1996, which means that inflation
may total 18 to 19 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
He said that the inflation rate is six times lower than in
1995. Inflation expectations are low, and a stable and predictable
currency policy is preserved, he said, pointing out a favorable
balance in foreign trade and considerable currency reserves.
</P>
<P>
Now, the production slump persists, and the GDP will decrease
by 5 percent, compared to 1995, Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, wages and salaries have shown an upward trend
since the beginning of 1996. The gap between the rich and the poor
is getting narrower, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, back wages are one of the country's most burning
problems, the premier admitted. According to him, over 40 trillion
roubles (7.4 billion U.S. dollars) should be paid out in back
wages, salaries and pensions.
</P>
<P>
The government has made a "tremendous effort" to stabilize the
situation, and the volume of back wages is going down, he said.
</P>
<P>
Out of the 40 trillion roubles in back wages, 33 trillion
roubles (6.1 billion dollars) are the debts of companies and
organizations which have no money of their own, and only 7
trillion roubles (3.3 billion dollars) should be cleared from
budgets of all levels, Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
The premier stressed, in general, that the economic situation
in Russia remains very complex and that this year's economic
development has "a depressive, crisis character."

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Urges North to Help South in Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh today drew
attention to the widening gap between the rich and the poor
nations and urged the North to aid the South in social and
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the United Nations General Assembly, Abdus Samad
Azad, foreign minister of Bangladesh, said that for economic
growth in the developing nations, a supportive external
environment is indispensable.
</P>
<P>
Worldwide poverty should be addressed through sustained flows
of resources from the North to the countries in the South as the
gap between the North and the South is widening at an ominous
rate.
</P>
<P>
In 1890, he said, the wealth of each European was twice that of
a South Asian. Today the figure is in excess of 70. in 1960, the
per capita GNP of the richest 20 percent of States was 30 times
higher than that of the poorest 20 percent. By 1989 the gap had
widened to 60 times.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the least developed nations' share of world trade
has plummeted in two decades from 0.8 percent to a mere o.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the problems of developing countries are also
problems of the whole world. Marginalization of developing
countries would be politically self-defeating and economically
counter-productive, he said.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Pledges to Pursue Peace Without Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat pledged today to seek peace without violence in his
meeting with Israeli President Ezer Weizman at the latter's
private villa in a Mediterranean resort.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Weizman held private talks at the latter's
residence in Caesarea of northern Israel. This is the first
public visit by Arafat to Israel, although he made a secret
visit last November to pay condolence to the widow of Israel's
slain premier Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
Noting peace is the only choice for both Israel and the
Palestinians, Arafat said that both sides should honor the
signed agreements and overcome any obstacle in order to build a
new Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"We have no other choice, we have no other alternative but to
continue our efforts to strengthen and protect the peace process
for our children and for your children," he said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also promised Weizman that he would ensure that no
Palestinian policeman would once again fire at Israeli soldiers
as in the bloodshed two weeks ago, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Israel was deeply angered by the scenes of Palestinian
policemen firing on Israeli soldiers in the bloody conflicts
which killed 75 people, including 15 Israeli soldiers. The
Israeli government has since been demanding that Palestinian
policemen involved in the shooting be punished, and proper steps
to be taken to prevent the repetition of such incidents.
</P>
<P>
Weizman said that he was pleased that the meeting had taken
place, which he said would help push forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"After a war, usually intelligent people try to achieve
peace. In war, you shoot; when you try to achieve peace, you
talk. So the purpose of this meeting is to help the process go
forward," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president also said that, if invited, he was willing to
pay a visit to the Gaza Strip to hold further talks with
Arafat. Israel Radio reported that Arafat has probably invited
Weizman to make such visit.
</P>
<P>
Weizman, who is only the nominal head of the state without
executive power, denied that he tried to weaken the authority of
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with his meeting with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
He said that he held the meeting in coordination with
Netanyahu, whom he would brief on the results of the talks.
</P>
<P>
The meeting with Arafat was actually announced by Weizman in
August, a move regarded as the president's attempt to pressure
Netanyahu to hold a meeting with Arafat whom the hardline
Israeli premier vowed never to meet in his pre-election campaign
before May.
</P>
<P>
Under the domestic and international pressure, Netanyahu in
early September held his first meeting with Arafat.

expected to travel to Jordan this week, in an attempt to reduce
the recent tension between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
According to Israel Radio today, Israel and Jordan have been
in contact to prepare for a meeting to be held as soon as
possible between Gold and Jordanian officials in Amman, capital
of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Gold's trip comes at a time when Jordan sharply criticized
Israel for the current difficult situation in the region,
warning the Jewish state to finalize the peace process, or face
dire consequences.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Arabic daily of Sharq Awsad, King
Hussein of Jordan said that "anything could happen" if Israel
does not strive forward to achieve peace, including a revival of
the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Hussein said that Israel's failure to honor the peace
agreement signed with the Palestinians could return the region
into a state of doubt and fear.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's Information Minister Marwan Muasher said today that
his country opposes the renegotiating of signed agreements because
that could sabotage the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Jordan had submitted a formal complaint to
Israel over the opening of the second entrance to the Hasmonean
Tunnel in Jerusalem's Old City, which triggered last month's
violent confrontation between Israel and the Palestinians in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Citing the peace treaty between the two countries, which
recognizes the Hashmite Kingdom's special role in the Moslem
holy sites in Jerusalem, Jordan said Israel should have first
consulted with Jordan before taking any steps.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Netanyahu downplayed the current tensions with
Jordan, probably Israel's closest friend in the region, saying
"even among friends, there could be differences."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to the coalition faction in the Knesset (Israel's
parliament), Netanyahu said he believed that "matters will be
worked out soon."

<HEADLINE> East African Leaders to Meet Christopher in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Heads of state of east
African countries will meet U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher in Arusha of Tanzania next Friday, according to the
Tanzanian Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The ministry spokesman told reporters here today that
Christopher, who initiated the meeting, was expected to arrive in
the northern town of Arusha on Friday morning and leave for South
Africa in the evening.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of state would hold talks respectively with
Tanzanian, Ugandan and Kenyan presidents, as well as former
Tanzanian president Mwalimu Julius Nyerere, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Christopher is expected to be briefed on regional problems,
especially the issue of Burundi during those talks.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. secretary of state would outline his government's
proposal for an African-led intervention force to be desployed in
trouble-spots such as Burundi, the Foreign Ministry source
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
The force is being planned to be composed of some 10,000
troops.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. would not sponsor this military unit unless African
nations and Washington's European allies gave it their full
support, diplomatic sources said.
</P>
<P>
East African leaders are also likely to request the U.S.
administration to promote American investment in east Africa,
mainly in tourism, mining and agro-based areas.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian Foreign Ministry spokesman said that Lake
Victoria, shared by the three east African countries of Tanzania,
Uganda and Kenya, could be proposed as a major project for
such investment.
</P>
<P>
It was also possible that the leaders would draw the attention
of the U.S. administration on the need to bituminize the
Kampala-Mutukula-Mwanza road, the spokesman added.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Satisfied With First Post-Apartheid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 8 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela
today expressed his satisfaction with arrangements for the first
post-apartheid census which begins on Thursday, and called on all
South Africans to help make it a success.
</P>
<P>
''You seem to have done a good job,'' Mandela told census
co-ordinator Pali Lehohla at the Union Buildings in Pretoria
after being asked about the planning of the forthcoming census.
</P>
<P>
The first post-apartheid population count, which would count
all its black population for the first time, begins on Thursday
and continues until the end of October.
</P>
<P>
However, Mandela was especially concerned about the counting
in remote rural areas, saying many villages did not appear on the
maps of the country. While Lehohla assured the president that
such villages had all been listed through physical visits.
</P>
<P>
''We are combing every inch of the country,'' said Lehohla.
</P>
<P>
Mandela also stressed that accurate information was vital to
the government's efforts to build a better life for all.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, census '96 would provide the information ''we need
for improving the standard of living for all our people'', said
the president.
</P>
<P>
In this first census since the days of apartheid, South Africa
would at last be counted as a single and united country, he
added.
</P>
<P>
According to Lehohla, a total of 98,000 people had been
recruited from the communities throughout the country for the
census '96. enditem

<HEADLINE> Angolan Parties React Strongly to UN Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Angolan political parties are
reacting strongly to a recent United Nations report on the
situation of Angola.
</P>
<P>
The UN Security Council is to open a meeting on Angola on
Friday, when a report by UN Secretary-general Boutros
Boutros-Ghali is expected for discussion.
</P>
<P>
The report criticized the former rebel UNITA movement of
Angola for failing to implement the peace accord effectively and
proposed to extend the mandate of the UN peace verification in
Angola for two months.
</P>
<P>
Abel Chivukuvuku, political advisor to UNITA leader Jonas
Savimbi, has issued a counter argument saying the UN report
is an exaggerated one.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan peace process has become irreversible and UNITA
has been made non-military, but a political party, according to
the UNITA spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Angola's Democratic Renovation Party leader Luis
dos Passos is demanding that the UN Security Council take more
powerful measures to force UNITA to implement the Lusaka peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
Angolan Democratic Party leader Alberto Neto has expressed a
similar view, urging the UN Security Council to stop UNITA from
making any more trouble.

<P>
MOSCOW, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin and his Moldovan counterpart, Andrei Sangheli, signed
a package of 11 economic cooperation agreements here today, for
the first time in bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>

"We want cooperation to continue developing in the future," he

<P>
In his opinion, there are no problems in bilateral relations
"on which we would be unable to agree."
</P>
<P>
The settlement of the Transdnestr conflict was also discussed.
Chernomyrdin confirmed the stance of the Russian leadership that

special status of the breakaway region as a part of indivisible
Moldova.

<P>
Head of the self-proclaimed Transdnestr republic Igor Smirnov
took part in the talks as a member of the Moldovan delegation, a

ADDIS ABABA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Cameroun, the current
chairman of the Organization of African Unity (OAU), seeks to
share Ethiopia's experience in conflict prevention, the newly
appointed Camerounian ambassador to Ethiopia, Mbea Mbea Jean
Hilaire, said today.
</P>
<P>
While presenting his credentials to Ethiopian President
Negasso Gidada, the Camerounian ambassador said that his country

<P>
MOSCOW, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Federation Council, upper
house of the Russian parliament, today adopted a resolution
endorsing a cessation of hostilities in the breakaway republic
of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
The resolution recognized the documents signed by Russian
security chief Alexander Lebed and Chechen separatist leaders
in the Daghestani town of Khasavyurt on August 31 as
"confirmation of the readiness by the sides to solve the
conflict peacefully."
</P>
<P>
The resolution suggested that the Russian authorities "proceed
with activities aimed at seeking a peaceful solution to the
situation in Chechnya in compliance with the Constitution of the
Russian Federation which determines the Chechen republic as a
component of the Russian Federation, its integral part."
</P>
<P>
The upper house stressed the necessity of outlining a draft
power-sharing treaty between the federal authorities and legally
elected bodies of the Chechen republic.
</P>
<P>
The document also suggested that President Boris Yeltsin
"instruct state bodies concerned to urgently work out and approve
a program of political, social and economic measures to provide a
way out of the current situation in Chechnya."
</P>

Commenting on the document, upper house speaker Yegor Stroyev

<HEADLINE> Canadian Chief of Defense Staff Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- General Jean Boyle, chief of the
defense staff of Canada, resigned today under pressure over the
Somalia scandal.
</P>
<P>
His resignation has been accepted by Canadian Prime Minister
Jean Chretien.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to the prime minister, Boyle said he is leaving
to give the new minister of national defense, who was appointed a
few days ago, "the greatest possible latitude for success in his
new portfolio."
</P>
<P>
Boyle became chief of the defense staff last December. Before
that, he was associate assistant deputy minister of policy and
communications at the defense headquarters.
</P>
<P>
It was in that role that Boyle got embroiled in a document
tampering scandal related to the Canadian Airborne Regiment's
mission to Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The Airborne was disbanded after several Somalis were killed
during the regiment's humanitarian mission to Somalia in 1993.
</P>
<P>
During the testimony at the Somalia inquiry in August, Boyle
admitted breaking the spirit of the Access to Information Act, if
not the letter of the law.
</P>
<P>
"I have a clear conscience about my period of service, but I
remain troubled about the way in which some critics appear to have
reached conclusions about my performance that are, in my judgment,
without proper foundation," he said in the letter.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Jean Chretien said he accepted Boyle's
resignation with regret. "You have served beyond the call of duty,
at a time of strain on a proud institution," he said in a letter
to Boyle.

<HEADLINE> SAA Management Rejects Union Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 7 (Xinhua) -- South African Airways
(SAA) management has rejected a conditional offer by the South
African Aviation, Engineering and Allied Union to suspend their
ongoing industrial action which has disrupted flights since last
Wednesday, said sources here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after a meeting in Johannesburg between
the SAA management and the union Tuesday afternoon, SAA spokesman
Leon Els said the union's conditions for suspending the ongoing
work-to-rule strike were unacceptable, and workers would be
locked out from the morning shift on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Els said: "the lockout clause will be applicable to those
members who continue with the industrial action as from tomorrow
(Wednesday)."
</P>
<P>
However, the management was still prepard to go to mediation
to resolve the matter and further discussions would take place
with the union, said Els.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 of the 2,200 technical staff involved in the
industrial action indicated today to SAA they were prepared to
return to work under usual conditions, said Els, adding they
would not be locked out.
</P>
<P>
The work-to-rule strike, which began last Wednesday, has
caused the delay and cancellation of a number of SAA domestic and
international flights, and is said to be costing the airline
about 10 million Rand (about 2.2 million US Dollars) in charter
fees, hotel expenses, meal vouchers and loss of revenue.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Labour Minister Tito Mboweni said earlier today
that he and the government were not in favour of SAA imposing a
lockout in their salary dispute with the union.
</P>
<P>
The union, representing about 2000 skilled personnel at
airports around the country, was demanding a 25 percent salary
increase, while SAA was offering a 10 percent across the board
increase and a 20 percent produtivity incentive bonus.
</P>
<P>
Els said SAA could not afford to go beyond its 10 percent
salary increase offer because "inflation and the state of the
industry just do not allow us to go beyond our offer".
</P>
<P>
However, Union President Joe Joubert said the union in 1988
carried out a market evaluation and asked for an appropriate
salary increase. This had not been granted and the demand for a
25 percent increase was "calculated from what we have lost since
1988". enditem

<HEADLINE> Mali Tells U.S. It Opposes Use of Sanction in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Malian Foreign Minister
Dioncounda Traore today told visiting U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher in Bamako that Mali opposes the use of economic
sanctions against any African country.
</P>
<P>
"The African culture does not go in the direction of embargo
or total exclusion. We are sceptic about the effectiveness of an
embargo but there could be other types of sanctions," Agence
France Presse quoted Traore as telling the press following a
meeting with Christopher.
</P>
<P>
The United States has expressed its wish to impose economic
sanctions on Nigeria for what it called "human rights
violations" in that West African country.
</P>
<P>
Christopher, who arrived in Bamako Monday evening, today held
talks with President Alpha Oumar Konare of Mali and announced that
Mali has agreed in principle to a U.S. proposal to set up a
pan-African peace-keeping force to deal with "purely
humanitarian" crises such as refugees in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Christopher also announced that the United States will send
Mali 700,000 U.S. dollars to finance the country's general
elections next year.
</P>
<P>
Washington will also provide one million dollars to help Mali
reintegrate the ethnic Touareg tribal people living in the north
of the country into the Malian society, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Peace-Corps volunteers will soon be sent to the north
of Mali, while the United States will continue to provide aid in
the areas of education, health and employment of youths, as well
as the economic reform of Mali, said Christopher.
</P>
<P>
Traore said that although the Yaounde summit of the
Organization of African Unity expressed in July its support to
Boutros Boutros-Ghali for a second term as U.N. Secretary General,
Mali considered it the most important thing to let an African to
run for a second term.
</P>
<P>
While agreeing to the option of letting a black African become
new head of the U.N., the United States has threatened to veto a
second term for Boutros-Ghali if he is re-elected.

<HEADLINE> Vice Presidential Candidates Interviewed before Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- As they prepare for Wednesday
night's debate, the candidates for vice president are trying to
keep the focus on U.S. President Bill Clinton and Republican
challenger Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
"It is not Al Gore vs. Jack Kemp," the Republican vice
presidential nominee said Tuesday in Florida.
</P>
<P>
In pre-debate interviews with The Associated Press, Gore and
Kemp anticipated their 90-minute debate tomorrow night would
closely follow the themes of Sunday's face off between Clinton and
Dole. That exchange focused on tax policy and the state of the
economy, on education, welfare and other social policies, and on
the U.S. role abroad.
</P>
<P>
Gore said he was determined to reinforce Clinton's argument
that the Republican ticket's 548 billion-dollar tax-cut plan would
require devastating cuts in Medicare and education spending. "The
numbers do not add up," Gore said.
</P>
<P>
While Kemp said he would follow up by taking issue with a new
Clinton campaign ad in which the president says he views his job
as "taking care of the American people."
</P>
<P>
The former House colleagues voiced friendship and respect for
each other and predicted their encounter would be a civil affair.
</P>
<P>
"You can disagree without being disagreeable," Gore said Monday
afternoon during a break in his debate preparations in
Sarasota, Florida.
</P>
<P>
Kemp was interviewed Tuesday morning before a practice session
in Bal Harbour, Florida.
</P>
<P>
Both Gore and Kemp reportedly entered their showdown with clear
missions.
</P>
<P>
Gore said he would point to lower unemployment, a shrinking
budget deficit and declining crime rates as evidence the
administration deserved four more years.
</P>
<P>
Kemp was most animated in discussing the new Clinton campaign
ad, and promised to make it an issue Wednesday night as he seeks
to build on Dole's efforts to paint Clinton as a big-government
liberal.
</P>
<P>
As Clinton's vice president, Gore has taken a leading role in
environmental and technology policies, as well as in U.S.-Russian
relations. He said he could not think of anything he would like to
add to his portfolio in a second Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
Policy differences aside, Kemp said he was impressed with the
Clinton-Gore partnership and predicted he would have a similar
bond with Dole, even though the two were political adversaries
before their 1996 alliance.
</P>
<P>
"Bob Dole would want me to help be the point guard for this
whole idea of reforming this tax code for the 21st century," Kemp
said. He also said he would continue his efforts to court black
support for the Republican Party.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Leading European stock markets
ended mixed today, with London hitting its third consecutive
record high while Frankfurt closing the session 11.47 points down.
</P>
<P>
In London, the FTSE 100 index had suffered an early loss of 36
points on the news that the government would end tax credits on
share buybacks or special dividend payouts, but later, stimulated
by a firm Wall Street, recovered from the losses to close at a
record 4,035.6, its third consecutive record close.
</P>
<P>
The government's decision prompted Reuters to suspend its
planned buy-back, though Barclays said the move would make no
difference to its policy of repurchasing shares.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the CAC-40 index also reversed early retreat to end
the day 9.99 points higher at 2,161.54.
</P>
<P>
A Strong Wall Street and firmer government bond prices helped
the bourse to breach the CAC's key support level of 2,150, dealers
said.
</P>
<P>
But the Frankfurt market in Germany closed down 11.47 points at
2,691.17. Shares were weaker at the close after a day of thin
trade.
</P>
<P>
However, dealers said that the market was just taking time to
consolidate after climbing to new highs recently.
</P>
<P>
London's Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading
British shares closed 4.1 points up at 4,035.6. The Frankfurt
DAX-30 share index ended down 11.47 points at 2,691.17. The Paris
CAC-40 index finished 9.99 higher at 2,161.54.

Also today, three U.S. scientists have won this year's Nobel
Prize for Physics for "their discovery of superfluidity in
helium-3," a breakthrough in low-temperature physics made in the
1970s.
</P>
<P>
David Lee and Robert Richardson from Cornell University and
Douglas Osheroff from Stanford University were awarded the prize
for discovering the way the helium isotope helium-3 behaves when
extremely cold.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said that the three
researchers "discovered at the beginning of the 1970s, in the
low-temperature laboratory at Cornell University, that the helium
isotope helium-3 can be made superfluid at a temperature only
about two thousandths of a degree above absolute zero."

ISLAMABAD -- The Afghan Taliban Militia today denied fighting
with the Uzbek Militia led by Rashid Dostum in northern
Afghanistan, said reports from Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Taliban official Sher Mohammed Stanakzai as
saying that Dostum's forces had not attacked Taliban forces near
the Salang Tunnel, about 120 kilometers north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
"We have not had a problem with General Dostum yet," Stanakzai
said. "There were some minor clashes between local commanders,
and that was not significant."
</P>
<P>
Taliban commanders at the Salang Tunnel said Tuesday that
forces loyal to Dostum had launched an attack on Taliban fighters.
</P>
<P>
But Stanakzai said that the clashes were between Taliban
fighters and the ousted government troops led by Ahmad Shah
Masood.

<HEADLINE> Seminar on Environmental Policies Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- As the first step of cooperation
between China and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) in the environmental field, the seminar on the
use of economic instruments in environmental polices in China
opened today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
At today's opening ceremony Wang Yangzu, deputy director of the
State Bureau of Environment Protection, said that China has paid
much attention on environment protection and the use of economic
instruments has proved to be very effective and necessary.
</P>
<P>
He said that OECD and its member countries have much useful
experience in this regard and he expressed his hope for further
exchanges between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
OECD Deputy Secretary-General Makoto Taniguchi said at the
ceremony that his organization was very interested in the
experience of China, particularly in its "pollution charge system"
which was started in 1979.
</P>
<P>
He said that since 1972 when the Polluter-Pays-Principle was
introduced by his organization, there has been an acceleration in
the number and range of environmental problems to which economic
instruments are applied.
</P>
<P>
Now in China many experts as well as officials suggest that the
time is ripe for further development of economic instruments.
</P>
<P>
More than one hundred representatives from both China and other
countries and regions attended the two-day seminar.

Sino-Austrian friendship and co-operation in various fields.
</P>
<P>
While recalling his visit to Austria in 1994, Li said that

<HEADLINE> Iran Asks for More Aids to Iraqi Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian authorities has
asked international communities for more assistance to Iraqi
Kurdish refugees being sheltered in camps in Iran.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Reza Rahimiyan, Governor of Iran's northwestern
province of Kurdistan, said Tuesday that the international
organizations should speed up dispatch of aids and relief
supplies as the Winter season is approaching.
</P>
<P>
Addressing more than 30 visiting ambassadors, diplomats and
representatives of the U.N. organizations in Sanandaj, capital of
the province, he said that "the international organizations
should be responsible for any consequence in the refugee camps
if they fail to provide assistance."
</P>
<P>
Rahimiyan complained about the indifference of European
countries in offering relief supplies to Kurdish refugees this
time, noting that no assistance was received from other countries
except for Italy and some international organizations.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian governor also called on other countries to put
pressure on the Iraqi government to bring about a calm situation
in the border region so that the refugees could go back to their
homes.
</P>
<P>
"We try to repatriate the Kurdish refugees when the situation
is getting calm," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, he assured foreign diplomats of considerable Iranian
assistance to the Iraqi refugees.
</P>
<P>
Rahimiyan said that his province has hosted 45,000 Iraqi
Kurdish refugees in two major camps.
</P>
<P>
The provincial authorities said that Iran is offering
refugees with various kinds of services, including water, rice,
flour, cooking oil, bread, sugar, tea, canned food, milk powder,
tents, blankets and clothing.
</P>
<P>
Senior diplomats from more than 30 countries, including
Australia, Britain, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy,
Japan, Malaysia, Holland, Spain and Thailand, made one-day tour
to the refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the visiting diplomats, Spanish
Ambassador Fernando Jose Belloso said that the world is well
aware of the large scale services and generous assistance
rendered by Iran to the Iraqi refugees.
</P>
<P>
The diplomats also talked with the Iraqi Kurds and asked
about the relief and medical services offered to them.
</P>
<P>
Bart Ostyn, an Iraqi refugee being sheltered in the
Sayranband camp, told Xinhua that they receive bread, rice, tea,
sugar, bean and biscuits.
</P>
<P>
Another refugee named Shwan Mohammad told Xinhua that usually
two families with a total of 10 people share one tent. The life
for refugees in the camp would be hard if the winter comes.
</P>
<P>
He said that "We thank Iran for hosting us as refugees and we
need help from other countries too."
</P>
<P>
Roger Vivarie, Deputy Chief of the Tehran Mission of the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), said that
the UNHCR has already granted 3.08 million U.S. dollars to cover
the basic needs of 40,000 new Iraqi Kurdish refugees for three
months.
</P>
<P>
The relief aid financed by the UNHCR addresses the basic needs
of refugees in terms of supplementary food, potable water,
sanitation, primary health, household items and shelter.
</P>
<P>
It covers procurement of such items as 7,000 family tents,
80,000 pieces of blankets, 40,000 sets of kitchen utensils,
cooking stoves, jerry cans, and fuel and water consumption.
</P>
<P>
However, U.N. officials were suspicious of the number of
Iraqi refugees in Iran. Iran said that there are 65,000 Iraqi
Kurdish refugees in the country, but U.N. officials put the
number at 40,000.
</P>
<P>
About 2 million refugees are now residing in Iran, about 1.5
million of them from Afghanistan and the rest from Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Two Americans, Briton Win 1996 Nobel Chemistry Prize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Two Americans and one Briton
today won the 1996 Nobel Chemistry Prize for their discovery of
fullerenes, new soccer-ball shaped forms of the element carbon in
which the atoms are arranged in closed shells.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said American professors
Robert Curl and Richard Smalley from Rice University, USA, and
Briton Harold Kroto from the University of Sussex, were awarded
the 1.12 million U.S. dollar prize.
</P>
<P>
Due to their discovery in 1985, "an entirely new branch of
chemistry developed, with consequences in such diverse areas as
astrochemistry, super-conductivity and materials
chemistry/physics," the academy said.
</P>
<P>
Robert Curl, born in 1933 in Texas, has been a professor at
Rice University in Houston, since 1967.
</P>
<P>
Richard Smalley, born in 1943 in Ohio, has been professor of
chemistry at Rice University since 1981 and also professor of
physics at the same university since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Harold Kroto, born in 1939 in England, became a professor of
chemistry at the University of Sussex in 1985 and a professor of
Royal Society Research in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The three scientists called their discovery fullerenes after
U.S. architect R Buckminster Fuller for his design of the geodesic
dome at the site of the world fair in 1967 in Montreal, Canada.
The shape of the dome closely tresembles the chemical structure of
the element carbon.

<HEADLINE> EC Approves Benchmarking for Industrial Competitiveness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
today approved the use of benchmarking as a tool for improving the
competitiveness of industry in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Benchmarking is a tool to continually monitor and assess
progress against continuously improving best practice world-wide.
</P>
<P>
It goes beyond competitive analysis by providing an
understanding of the processes and skills that create superior
performance.
</P>
<P>
The EC has found that Europe's industry lags behind its major
competitors like the United States and Japan in terms of job
creation, productivity levels and employment rates. Export market
shares, profit margins and investment returns remain inadequate.
</P>
<P>
High cost levels for key inputs such as labor, energy, water,
communications and transport, and low investment in research and
development, plant and equipment contribute to EU industry's poor
performance, the Commission said.
</P>
<P>
The aim of benchmarking is to provide companies with
information about best practice worldwide to help them improve
their competitiveness.

relations.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier On Administrative System Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng said today that
the country will continue its administrative structural reforms in
accord with the Socialist market economy and will focus on
improving civil servants and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks in a meeting with scholars and government
officials from over 100 countries, regions and international
organizations attending the Third International Conference of
Administrative Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Li told the participants in the conference that China has
placed importance on administrative reforms since the reform and
opening-up policy began 18 years ago.
</P>
<P>
He said that there has been a reform of the political structure
at the same time as the economic reforms and that there has been
some progress.
</P>
<P>
Li explained that there have been three major steps in the
administrative structure reforms over the past 18 years, and that
the last step came in 1993 when China cut the number of government
employees by a great deal, marking the beginning of the civil
service system.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that China values international co-operation
in the field of administration and is willing to learn from other
countries' experience in management and administration, suited to
China's conditions.

<HEADLINE> France Closely Watches Christopher's Tour of Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 9 (Xinhua) -- France is closely watching the
present visit by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher in
Africa, including a number of French-speaking west African
countries which are traditionally allied with France.
</P>
<P>
The French Minister of Cooperation and African Affairs Jacques
Godfrain said today that U.S. President Bill Clinton, who did not
even mention Africa in his recent speech at the U.N. General
Assembly, is seeking the votes of African-Americans by sending
Christopher to Africa.
</P>
<P>
However, France, which does not agree to a U.S. proposal to set
up a pan-Africa peace keeping force to deal with humanitarian
crisis on the black continent, is also worried about the newly
launched economic offensive by American companies in west Africa,
especially the economically booming Cote d'Ivoire, said French
officials.
</P>
<P>
Ivorian Prime Minister Daniel Kablan-Duncan recently warned
France against the likelihood of being knocked out by the U.S.
from its traditional sphere of economic interests.
</P>
<P>
President Jacques Chirac reportedly chaired a meeting last week
on France's reaction to the growing aggressiveness of U.S. Africa
policy.
</P>
<P>
France, which maintains 8,000 soldiers in Africa, prefers to
seek solution to crises in Africa through the mechanisms of the
United Nations and the Organization of African Unity, while the
United States plans to select some African states to set up a
multi-national force for such missions.
</P>
<P>
Mali has expressed its support in principle for the U.S.
proposal to build the African force, during the visit in Bamako by
Christopher Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
France is expected to try to win back the support of African
states at the next Franco-African annual summit to be held in
December in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso.

<HEADLINE> U.S.Remains World's Biggest Arms Supplier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The United States has become the
dominant supplier in the international sales of conventional
weapons, the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS)
said here today.
</P>
<P>
It has exported arms worth over 15 billion U.S. dollars each
year since 1992, taking over half the market, the IISS said in its
annual report on the state of world's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
"U.S. arms transfers now account for around half the reported
global arms trade compared to between one-quarter and one-third
during the 1980's," the report said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. continues to take a major share of arms transfers to
countries with which it has a bilateral or multilateral security
agreement," it added.
</P>
<P>
According to IISS, most U.S. arms sales remain
government-to-government transactions executed by the Department
of Defense in the Foreign Military Sales program, but direct
commercial sales account for an increasing proportion of total
sales.
</P>
<P>
"Direct grant aid to acquire U.S. arms and equipment has fallen
from Cold War levels, but still accounts for about one-quarter of
all U.S. arms transfers through the Foreign Military Financing and
Excess Defense Articles programs," the IISS said.

BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists are
developing new models of the Long March carrier rocket, Li
Jianzhong, president of the China Carrier Rocket Technology
Research Institute, told delegates to the 47th Congress of the
International Astronautical Federation, here today.
</P>
<P>
They include the Long March-1-D, which can carry close-orbiting
satellites weighing 150 to 1,000 kg, and the Long March-2-C, which
can carry several satellites in one load and put them in precise
locations, and which is expected to be put into use next year.
</P>
<P>
The Long March-2-E is still in the design stage, and will be
able to carry several satellites to orbits about 1,000 km above
the earth.
</P>
<P>
Scientists are also working on carrier rockets that can carry a
20-ton payload or transport space facilities, Li said.
</P>
<P>
In the past 40 years, China had a great deal of success with
its carrier rockets and has eight models of the Long March in use
now. By the end of 1995, the rocket had had 39 launchings and 36
successes, putting 39 satellites into orbit. Eight satellites were
from overseas.
</P>
<P>
When compared in effective load ratio, length, payload, and
thrust with similar rockets elsewhere, the Long March rockets can
be said to be at international standards, Li said.

<HEADLINE> Karachi Stock Exchange to Observe Friday as </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Karachi Stock Exchange
(KSE), Pakistan's largest stock exchange, will continue to observe
Friday as weekly holiday instead of Sunday.
</P>
<P>
This was decided unanimously in the general meeting of the KSE
held this afternoon in the southern port city of Karachi,
according to local reports.
</P>
<P>
"Response of traders and industrialists on the first Friday was
very poor and disappointing. We see no reason to be open alone on
Fridays," an attendant of the meeting observed.
</P>
<P>
The Karachi Stock Exchange was opened for trading last Friday
on trial basis on the call of the Federation of Pakistan Chamber
of Commerce and Industry (FPCCI).
</P>
<P>
The FPCCI called local industries to observe Sunday as weekly
holiday instead of Friday.
</P>
<P>
The reason for the change was to have better communication with
the international commercial and economic activities and to
improve the economic performance of the country.
</P>
<P>
However, as a Muslim country, almost all commercial and
government institutions in Pakistan are closed on Fridays, which
is the pray day for Muslims.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: US Wants to Form African Crisis Response Force (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Moose said the ACRF would
cost between 25 and 45 million U.S. Dollars for the equipment and
training of the force. More money would be needed for its
deployment.
</P>
<P>
"We have our own financial obligations. We will pay our fair
share of that," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moose noted that while the U.S. has been the driving force
behind the formation of the ACRF, it has to involve the majority
of African's 53 states, all members of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
European Union member states have also been invited to get
involved. During the past months, Moose has visited almost half
of the African states and Europe to discuss the idea of the ACRF.
</P>
<P>
A State Department official said on Tuesday in Bamako, capital
of Mali, that the U.S. and European countries "were no longer
willing to commit their troops in African conflicts".
</P>
<P>
The United States got its fingers badly burned in 1993 when a
humanitarian mission to Somalia turned violent, leaving scores of
U.S. troop dead.
</P>
<P>
The last U.S. Secretary of State to visit Africa was James
Baker in 1990 whom Christopher succeeded in January 1992.
</P>
<P>
Critics of the foreign policy of President Clinton said the
fact that the African trip comes at the tail end of the
president's four-year term is a sign of his administration's
neglect of the continent since the end of the cold war.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The dispute over the Sipandan
and Ligitan islands that Indonesia and Malaysia have agreed to
bring to the International Court of Justice is expected not to
disturb the stability of Southeast Asia, an Indonesian legislator
said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The Sipandan-Ligitan issue is just a minor problem. We should
give priority to the maintenance of stability in the peaceful and
prosperous ASEAN region," said Zamharir Ar, vice chairman of the
Inter-Parliament Cooperation Board.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian President Soeharto paid a visit to Malaysia Monday
and Tuesday, during which leaders of the two countries agreed to
bring the issue of the disputed islands to the International Court
of Justice in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
The agreement reflects the two countries' intention to seek a
quick but comprehensive solution to the problem, said Zamharir Ar.
</P>
<P>
He said that Indonesian and Malaysian leaders do not want to
bequeath the problem to the next generation of the two neighboring
nations, which both belong to the Melanesian ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
The two countries held a series of bilateral talks on the issue
in the spirit of the ASEAN, but failed to come to any solution.
</P>
<P>
Both Indonesia and Malaysia are laying claims to the two
islands located at their border.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia bases its claim on a map made in 1821 when the
country was still under the Dutch rule whereas Malaysia bases its
claim on a map made by British in 1963.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- A mammoth mass parade along
with military march were held here today to celebrate the 34th
anniversary of Uganda's independence.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the nation to mark the Independence Day, President
Yoweri Museveni said, "We have now a democratic order because
early this year we elected the first president through universal
presidential elections."
</P>
<P>
"Members of parliament was also elected and we remain to elect
local goverment leaders," said the Ugandan president when
presiding over a huge celebration ceremony in the capital in
which South African President Nelson Mandela was present.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the economic achievements in the country, Museveni
said, Uganda exported only nine kinds of products 10 years ago
while at present it exports 25 products.
</P>
<P>
He said the exports of coffee, Uganda's main foreign exchange
earner, accounted for 97 percent of value of all the exports in
1986 wen his administration came to power, but now the figure
has been reduced to only 64 percent.
</P>
<P>
"In mining area, we have 20 new mining companies," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Dwelling in the field of industries in general, Museveni said,
"we have received in the last six years alone proposals for the
setting up of 2,171 new projects. These are worth 2.8 billion
U.S. Dollars. out of all these, investments of 892 million Us
Dollars have been put onto the ground."
</P>
<P>
However, he frowned on corruption and called on people to use
constitution as a weapon to fight against it in the country.
</P>
<P>
On relations with foreign countries, Museveni said Uganda has
been on good terms with all countries except Sudan, and it is
trying hard to see how to mend fences with its northern neighbor.
</P>
<P>
Both sides accuse the other of backing its rebels.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of people from all parts of the country as
well as diplomatic envoys accredited here attended the ceremony
which lasted for hours.

<HEADLINE> New Caledonian Party Urges France to Back Independence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The French government was today
urged to make a "strong gesture" in support of independence for
the South Pacific island of New Caledonia by the territory's
independence movement.
</P>
<P>
The Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front (FLNKS) of New
Caledonia is due re-start negotiations with Paris over
independence later this week. Talks with French Prime Minister
Alain Juppe broke off in April after the FLNKS pulled out saying
no account was being taken of independence demands.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac is due to meet with the leader
of New Caledonia's anti-independence movement, Jacques Lafleur, in
Paris on Thursday to discuss issues concerning the colony's future
status.
</P>
<P>
Late French President Francois Mitterrand agreed in principle
to the launching of an independence process in the French
territory in 1988 after the militant wing of the FLNKS launched a
series of attacks on French police forces on the island.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, which ended violence on the island, a
referendum on self-determination was set for 1998.
</P>
<P>
On October 6, the Caledonian Union, the main arm of the FLNKS,
decided on a 12-point framework for negotiating with the French
government at a meeting in Noumea, capital of New Caledonia.
</P>
<P>
The party had earlier decided on the principle of settling once
for all "the colonial dispute between the Kanak people and French
state, created by the unilateral taking into possession of the
Kanak country (by France) in 1853."
</P>
<P>
The FLNKS, the moderate wing of the independence movement, has
also asked for the status of an "associate state" with France
after independence whereby France would be responsible for
security, law and order and currency for 10 to 18 years.
</P>
<P>
New Caledonia, with a population of under 200,000 has an strong
indigenous Kanak population who have driven the island's
independence movement.

Scotland went on to the pitch at the new start time and

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, October 9 (Xinhua) -- A well-known Chinese in Macao
urged the Taiwan Authorities to help promote the reunification of
China and stop splitting activities.
</P>
<P>
Ma Man Kei, president of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce of
Macao, made these remarks today at a gathering marking the 85th
anniversary of the "1911 Revolution" led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen that
overthrew China's Qing Dynasty (1644-1911), the last dynasty in
the Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the Taiwan Authorities would follow Dr. Sun
Yat-sen's will to 'go with the world's tide and meet the demand of
the people'," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president noted that the policy of "one country, two
systems" on the basis of peaceful reunification is the fundamental
principle to resolve the issue, and blamed the Taiwan authorities
for trying to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan".
</P>
<P>
The exchanges and contacts across the Taiwan Straits have
increased rapidly over the past several years, and that is
contributing to the peaceful reunification of the country, he
said. "But the Taiwan authorities have gone against it," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ma, who is also vice-chairman of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), called on people in Macao to make greater
contributions to a stable transition of Macao and to the cause of
China's reunification.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 people attended today's gathering at a hospital
where Dr. Sun had once worked as a doctor. Baskets of flowers were
laid before a bronze statue of the leader, which was erected
several years ago in the courtyard of the hospital.

its belt and relegate those of its jobs which can be better done
by the private industry to help the economy increase its
international competitiveness.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Call for Aerospace Co-operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese aerospace
official said today that there should be co-operation to make
peaceful use of space resources and space technology development.
</P>
<P>
Liu Jiyuan, director of the China Aerospace Administration,
made the remarks at the opening of the Fourth Space Agency Forum,
here today.
</P>
<P>
From now on, he said, space technology should not be a tool
used by one country to achieve military superiority in space, but
a means of solving human problems.
</P>
<P>
Aviation and aeronautics officials from 20 countries and eight
international organizations attended the forum to discuss the
science, exploration, and education aspects of space, and planet
earth's role.
</P>
<P>
A part of space technology in the 21st century is related to
human affairs, such as population, natural resources, the
environment, disasters, telecommunications, education, culture,
and poverty, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that by the mid-part of the next century, the earth's
mineral resources, the main energy source, will nearly be
exhausted and space technology will allow people to make more
efficient use of resources on earth and in space and to develop
newer, cleaner forms of energy.
</P>
<P>
He said that trust should be established between countries and
worldwide co-operation in technology increased, and any arms race
in outer space should be stopped.
</P>
<P>
"This is an important sign for the human society to step into
civilization and progress in the 21st century," he said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, China and other Asian countries, including India,
Pakistan, Thailand, and the Republic of Korea, have had
multi-lateral co-operation in space technology and its
applications in the Asia-Pacific area.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Taliban Deny Fighting with Uzbek Militia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban Militia
today denied fighting with the Uzbek Militia led by Rashid Dostum
in northern Afghanistan, said reports from Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The reports quoted Taliban official Sher Mohammed Stanakzai as
saying that Dostum's forces had not attacked Taliban forces near
the Salang Tunnel, about 120 kilometers north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
"We have not had a problem with General Dostum yet," Stanakzai
said. "There were some minor clashes between local commanders, and
that was not significant."
</P>
<P>
Taliban commanders at the Salang Tunnel said Tuesday that
forces loyal to Dostum had launched an attack on Taliban fighters.
</P>
<P>
But Stanakzai said that the clashes were between Taliban
fighters and the ousted government troops led by Ahmad Shah
Masood.
</P>
<P>
"I think that the fighting on Tuesday was not with Dostum's
forces but with Masood's forces who had infiltrated Dostum's
territory," he said.
</P>
<P>
Having overrun Kabul on September 27, Taliban troops chased
Masood's men northward and reached the Salang Tunnel where
Dostum's men had already dug in.
</P>
<P>
Dostum, who controlled seven provinces in northern Afghanistan,
has become a major rival to the Taliban who want to wipe out all
the warlords in Afghanistan and unite the country.
</P>
<P>
Previous reports said that Dostum was likely to join hands with
ousted President Burhanuddin Rabbani against the advancing
Taliban.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Working in International Astronautical Federation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- China's long range rocket
program was the launch pad for the country's entry into the
international astronautical world.
</P>
<P>
Now scientists from all over China have taken their place
alongside space experts from around the globe.
</P>
<P>
And it has confirmed China's position as one of the few
countries with an independent long range rocket capability.
</P>
<P>
That position has moved into a new sphere this week with the
launch of the International Astronautical Federation (IAF)
Congress in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The IAF was set up in 1950 and has 129 member organizations in
45 countries. The federation allows several members in a single
country, but only one member can have the right to vote, according
to IAF regulations.
</P>
<P>
China did not join the federation until 1980 because Taiwan had
the right to vote in the federation in 1958.
</P>
<P>
The successful launch of long-range carrier rockets in May 1980
by China upgraded the country to one of the few with such a
capability.
</P>
<P>
The historical event helped international astronautical circles
realize that China had achieved remarkable success in the space
industry.
</P>
<P>
The greater event made the federation adopted China
Astronautics Society as a member in 1980, which replaced Taiwan to
get the right to vote.
</P>
<P>
Since 1980 China Astronautics Society has dispatched
representative groups to attend astronautical congresses. Some
Chinese representatives have also been promoted to become leaders
in the federation.
</P>
<P>
Yang Jiaxi, a Chinese expert in automatic control technology,
was elected at the 34th congress of the federation in 1983 to be
vice-chairman of the Executive Bureau of the federation, and was
reappointed until 1987.
</P>
<P>
At the 38 congress of the federation in 1987, Lu Yuanjiu, a
Chinese inertia technology expert, was elected to replace Yang
Jiaxi. And Chen Fangrong, a new expert in space test and control,
was elected in 1991, and then in 1994 the place went to Liang
Sili, a rocket technology expert.
</P>
<P>
And since 1985, more than 40 Chinese astronautics scientists
have been promoted to be academicians in the International
Astronautical Academy of Sciences, which was set up by IAF.
</P>
<P>
Ren Xinmin, a expert in space engineering technology, serves as
a member of the board of directors in the academy.

<HEADLINE> China's Effort for More Than Maintaining Property Value </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- China will establish a set of
well-defined codes that assess the ways in which the value of
state-owned property is maintained and increased, the State
Administration of State Property said here today.
</P>
<P>
The SASP will also improve the management system for state
property, and create a policy of rewards and penalties concerning
how to maintain and increase the value of the property.
</P>
<P>
It will also aid the effort of Chinese enterprises to establish
and perfect an internal operating system and clearly define the
rights, responsibilities and benefits of various sections.
</P>
<P>
"All the efforts are designed to maintain and increase the
value of state property," an SASP official said.
</P>
<P>
China completed 1995's annual assessment of how the value of
property in state-owned enterprises has been maintained and
increased at the end of July, the official said.
</P>
<P>
An examination of 83,315 large and medium-sized state-owned
enterprises, including 4,326 companies run by the central
authorities and 78,989 local firms, shows that they accounted for
74 percent of the account value of the rights and interests of all
state-owned enterprises at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The value of state-owned assets in the assessed enterprises
grew by 3.59 percent in 1995, 0.59 percent higher than the target
set at the beginning of last year.
</P>
<P>
When State investment is calculated, the value of state
property in the enterprises appreciated by 28 percent, the
official said.

<HEADLINE> Golden Ball Should Be Given to Kanu, Vialli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Chelsea's Italian striker Gianluca
Vialli said on Tuesday that Nigerian soccer star Nwankwo Kanu
should be awarded the honor of Golden Ball.
</P>
<P>
The remarks were made on Italian television by Vialli, a former
Juventus skriker and now representing England's Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian Olympic champion Kanu was forced earlier to quit
football due to a heart condition.
</P>
<P>
The Golden Ball award, which was given to Liberian George Weah,
is organised each year by France Football magazine and voted by a
worldwide panel of experts.
</P>
<P>
Kanu was revealed to have a weak aorta valve during a routine
medical test in late August, weeks after signing for Inter Milan
from Ajax Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old striker faces an operation to correct the
condition, but Inter have rated his chances of ever playing again
as one percent.
</P>
<P>
Kanu has already won virtually everything there is to win in
football, as a teenager.
</P>
<P>
He triumphed in the Under 17 world championship with Nigeria in
1993, where he was spotted by Ajax, and went on to win two Dutch
league championships, the European Cup in 1995 and the
Intercontinental Cup, before his goals guided his country to
Olympic gold.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- China has a firm foundation and
a promising future in satellite launching, according to Dr. Karl
H. Doetsch, president of the International Astronautical
Federation, during the ongoing 47th Congress of the federation in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
He said it was correct for China to develop its space
technology industry, and that China has geared up its capability
to launch satellites.
</P>
<P>
Though China has suffered from several satellite launch
failures, similar mishaps have also happened in other countries,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Space technology, added Dr Doetsch, is an industry with high
risks, so failures in satellite launching can be common.
</P>
<P>
China should strengthen cooperation with other countries in the
peaceful use and development of resources in outer space to ease
the consequences of a rising population, and a shortage of
resources, in a bid to make greater contributions to development
for human beings.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the development of offensive weapons in outer space
should be discouraged, Doetsch said.

<HEADLINE> Experts Optimistic on China's Grain Potential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Domestic and overseas experts
today expressed confidence in China's grain production potential.
</P>
<P>
At an international symposium, "China's Grain and
Agriculture: Prospects and Policy", experts agreed that China has
great grain production potential, and will not pose any threat to
the world food supply.
</P>
<P>
A high-ranking official from the country's Ministry of
Agriculture addressed the symposium, saying he is sure of China's
capacity to ensure the balance between food supply and demand,
mainly relying on domestic production.
</P>
<P>
According to his calculation, by the year 2000, the country
will need 499.2 billion kilograms of grain. The demand will
increase to 550 billion kilograms by 2010 and to 640 billion
kilograms by 2030.
</P>
<P>
But China will never loosen up on the production of grain, and
the government's support for agriculture will not be weakened, but
strengthened in the future.
</P>
<P>
He also analysed the potential of grain output increase, noting
that the output of grain from each hectare of farmland in the
country will rise by a large margin.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that only 35 percent of China's agricultural
output increase has come from technology and sciences upgrading,
25 percentage points lower than in developed countries. The
utilization rates of water irrigation and chemical fertilizers can
both increase by at least 20 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkish security forces are
continuing large-scale military operations against the rebels of
the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) in the border areas
with northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported today that
the security forces have continuously attacked the mountainous
regions in Beytussebap and Uludere towns in Sirnak province and
in Cukurca and Semdinli towns in Hakkari province, into which PKK
militants have been infiltrated from the vacuum of northern Iraq for
the winter preparations.
</P>
<P>
Anatolia quoted Necati Bilican, governor of the Emergency Rule
Region, as saying: "Armed clashes (between security forces and
PKK) often take place. A group of 500-600 terrorists are planning
an action," adding that many PKK militants are infiltrated into
the region from PKK's Zap camp based in the Hakkari border on
the side of northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The security forces have killed 191 PKK elements in the
military operations which started five days ago in southeastern
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
More than 21,000 people have been killed in conflicts between
Turkish government troops and the PKK since August 1984 when the
PKK started a guerrilla war for autonomy in the southeast of
Turkey.

<P>
FREETOWN, October 9 (Xinhua) -- South African mercenary group,
The Executive Outcomes on Tuesday escorted about 200 teachers and
students back to their institutions in the south and east of the
country, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The move of the Executive Outcomes was backed by heavily armed
Sierra Leonean soldiers and paramilitary Special Services
Division. The teachers and students were in the capital during
the two month vacation when rebel ambushes escalated on strategic
highways leading to the provinces and grounded to a near halt
commuter traffic between the capital and other areas in the war
stricken country.
</P>
<P>
The various ambushes, according to military souces, have
claimed the lives of up to some 100 people within the two month
period and loss of about 500,000 Dollars worth of merchandise,
including rice and other essential foodstuffs, hijacked by the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-seven primary and secondary school teachers and 41
students went to Bo in the south while 90 students and teachers
were dropped at Kenema in the east. They traveled in three buses.

<HEADLINE> Experts Optimistic on China's Grain Potential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China also has 33 million hectares of waste land suitable for
cultivation, 130 million ha barren hills and 66 million ha of
waste sand areas which can be made full use. It also has a large
acreage of middle and low-yielding land, which accounts for one
third of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xiaofang, an expert from the State Science and Technology
Commission, predicted in his speech that China's grain output has
a potential to increase by 30 to 100 percent. In this way, by the
end of 2030, when the country's population reaches 1.6 billion,
China will also be able to feed its people.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that increasing input in agriculture, improving
the basic conditions of agriculture, rationally developing natural
resources and spreading the use of techniques and sciences will
help realise the prediction.
</P>
<P>
Nikos Alaxandratos, from the United Nations Food and
Agriculture Organization (FAO), said China's government, grain
producers and consumers will spare no efforts to jointly work out
a plan to balance food demand and supply.
</P>
<P>
The three-day symposium, which has just closed, was sponsored
by the Ministry of Agriculture. More than 100 representatives from
international organizations, and from more than ten countries and
regions, such as the United States, Japan and Hong Kong, attended
the symposium.

<HEADLINE> Founding anniversary of International Brigades Marked in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- A symposium marking the 60th
anniversary of the setting up of the International Brigade in the
Spanish Anti-Fascist War was held today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the symposium, Huang Hua, President of the China
Society for People's Friendship Studies, said that it was
necessary to carry forward internationalism and the selfless
spirit of the International Brigade, and make great efforts for
maintaining world peace and the progress of mankind.
</P>
<P>
The International Brigade was formed by anti-fascist champions
from countries all over the world 60 years ago, to aid the
Republic of Spain which was invaded by German and Italian
fascists. More than 100 Chinese people joined the brigade, and
most of them sacrificed their lives in the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
The symposium was jointly sponsored by the China Society for
People's Friendship Studies and the National Museum of Chinese
Revolution.
</P>
<P>
Many photographs, material objects and manuscripts are also on
display at an exhibition to recall that period of history.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress Cheng Siyuan, and people from diplomatic, media
and publishing, literature and education circles, attended the
symposium. Dr. Lanto Kanetti, David Crook and other veterans who
joined the International Brigade, and Spanish ambassador to China
Juan Lena, also attended the symposium.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: US Wants to Form African Crisis Response </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Moose said the ACRF would
cost between 25 and 45 million U.S. Dollars for the equipment and
training of the force. More money would be needed for its
deployment.
</P>
<P>
"We have our own financial obligations. We will pay our fair
share of that," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moose noted that while the U.S. has been the driving force
behind the formation of the ACRF, it has to involve the majority
of Africa's 53 states, all members of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
European Union member states have also been invited to get
involved. During the past months, Moose has visited almost half
of the African states and Europe to discuss the idea of the ACRF.
</P>
<P>
A State Department official said on Tuesday in Bamako, capital
of Mali, that the U.S. and European countries "were no longer
willing to commit their troops in African conflicts".
</P>
<P>
The United States got its fingers badly burned in 1993 when a
humanitarian mission to Somalia turned violent, leaving scores of
U. S. troop dead.
</P>
<P>
The last U.S. Secretary of State to visit Africa was James
Baker in 1990 whom Christopher succeeded in January 1992.
</P>
<P>
Critics of the foreign policy of President Clinton said the
fact that the African trip comes at the tail end of the
president's four-year term is a sign of his administration's
neglect of the continent since the end of the cold war.

<HEADLINE> Three Americans Share 1996 Nobel Prize for Physics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Three U.S. scientists have won
this year's Nobel Prize for Physics for "their discovery of
superfluidity in helium-3", a breakthrough in low-temperature
physics made in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
David Lee and Robert Richardson from Cornell University and
Douglas Osheroff from Stanford University were awarded the prize
for discovering the way the helium isotope helium-3 behaves when
extremely cold.
</P>
<P>
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said that the three
researchers "discovered at the beginning of the 1970s, in the
low-temperature laboratory at Cornell University, that the helium
isotope helium-3 can be made superfluid at a temperature only
about two thousandths of a degree above absolute zero."
</P>
<P>
Superfluidity is a scientific term for when a liquid is made so
cold it loses all its usual molecular patterns.
</P>
<P>
Research teams used superfluid helium-3 to test their theories
about the origins of the universe.
</P>
<P>
David Lee, born in 1931 in Rye, New York State, and Robert
Richardson, born in 1937 in Washington DC, now both work at
Cornell University's Department of Physics.
</P>
<P>
Douglas Osheroff, born in Aberdeen, Washington State in 1945,
is now a professor of the Department of Physics in Stanford
University.
</P>
<P>
All the three scientists have received, among other awards, the
Institute of Physics Sir Francis Simon Memorial Prize in 1976 and
the Oliver E. Buckley Solid State Physics Prize (American Physical
Society) in 1980 for their discovery of superfluidity in
helium-3.

<HEADLINE> Grassland Tours Flourish in Inner Mongolia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HOHHOT, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Hulun Buir Prairie in north
China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has vigorously developed
travel programs featuring grassland scenes and ethnic cultures.
</P>
<P>
A total of 18 major scenic zones and eight travel routes have
been established on the Prairie, which has a well-developed travel
service system.
</P>
<P>
There are 15 national highly-rated travel agencies, 25 hotels
able to accommodate foreign tourists, and more than 3,000 people
employed in the tourism business in the Hulun Buir League.
</P>
<P>
The Hulun Buir Prairie is an ideal summer resort with a
temperature averaging 20 degrees celsius in the summer.
</P>
<P>
The league has rich tourism resources represented by the
primitive forests in the Dahinggan Mountains, which are ideal
environments for mountaineering and expeditions.
</P>
<P>
The area is also home to nomadic nationalities in north China
such as the Ewenki, Oreqen and Daur peoples, and their unique folk
cultures add to the interest of tours in the area.
</P>
<P>
There are 10 national category A and B ports of entry along its
1,600-kilometer-long border with Russia and Mongolia, which are
convenient for border tourism, as visas are not required at these
ports of entry.
</P>
<P>
The Hulun Buir League was the first in the region to introduce
an overall reform of its tourism administration system in 1991,
which encouraged the development of state-run, collectively-run,
and private tourism businesses.
</P>
<P>
The league has invested more than 200 million yuan in the past
six years to develop major tourism programs, such as tours along
the Ergune River, in the Daben Lake National Nature Preservation
Zone, and grassland and folk culture tours.

a hearing on the 100,000 US dollars cheating case involving former
prime minister P.V. Narasimha Rao.

<P>
Additional Sessions Judge Ajit Bharihoke adjourned the hearing

"The presence of the accused on October 16 is not necessary,"

The court had earlier fixed September 30 for Rao's personal
appearance before the court but the Supreme Court exempted him of
this till the pronouncement of order on the Delhi police plea.

Dalian, October 9 (Xinhua) -- A zoo in Dalian city's Baiyun
scenic spot, in northeast China's Liaoning Province, has opened
its doors to visitors to show off over one thousand animals.
</P>
<P>
The zoo covers an area of one hundred hectares, and features
many rare and unusual animals.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the zoo began in May, 1995. From design to
construction, the planners have consistently emphasized the theme
of "green and life", in a bid to show harmony between
human-beings, animals and nature.
</P>
<P>
The design incorporates ideas from U.S.A., Japan, Taiwan and
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The zoo is divided into six major parts, including an
herbivorous animal area, a lion and tiger area, elephant area,
monkey hills, bear hills and omnivorous animal area.
</P>
<P>
Besides the six major parts, some comprehensive display areas,
including a popular science hall and tropical forest hall, are
still under construction, scheduled to be finished at the end of
1996.
</P>
<P>
The zoo is currently only partly opened, and is planned to be
completely in use on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
For the convenience of visitors, three viaducts have been
built. Two single track overhead trains with a capacity of 75
passengers add a modern dimension to the zoo.

<HEADLINE> WHO Urges Action to Combat Yellow Fever Resurgence in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) announced today that it has prepared a comprehensive
five-year initiative to control a "dramatic resurgence" of yellow
fever in Africa during the past decade.
</P>
<P>
According to WHO experts, some 200,000 cases of yellow fever
now occur yearly in 33 endemic countries of Africa, the vast
majority of them in sub-Saharan parts of the continent.
</P>
<P>
A number of yellow fever epidemics have occurred during the
1990s, including in Kenya in 1992, Ghana in 1993, Gabon in 1994,
Liberia in 1995 and currently in Benin. In Nigeria, the largest
endemic country, there have been an estimated one million cases of
the disease during the past decade, WHO said.
</P>
<P>
Of greatest concern to WHO experts is the potential for urban
outbreaks. The Aedes aegypti mosquito which transmits the yellow
fever virus to humans is now widespread in many African cities,
making rapidly spreading and highly fatal epidemics an
ever-present threat to millions of urban dwellers.
</P>
<P>
The prime goal of the new WHO initiative is to rapidly expand
vaccination coverage for yellow fever in Africa by linking it with
mass campaigns against polio and measles, which many countries are
planning to implement in the next two years, while integrating
yellow fever vaccination into routine childhood immunization
programs.
</P>
<P>
According to WHO, the yellow fever vaccine currently in use is
one of the most effective vaccines, resulting in long-lasting
immunity in 95 percent or more of recipients.
</P>
<P>
But many of the African countries worst-hit by the resurgence
of yellow fever are also among the poorest on the continent and
are unable to afford the vaccines with their own resources.
</P>
<P>
The WHO initiative, to be coordinated with relevant African
countries, will integrate the partnership efforts of bilateral
agencies, other U.N. bodies and nongovernmental organizations.
The total cost for the initiative is estimated at 190 million
U.S. dollars.

NINGBO, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Ningbo Bonded Zone in this
coastal city of Zhejiang province, east China, has issued
preferential policies for taxation and financing to encourage the
settlement of productive enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The zone has concentrated on international entrepot trade and
bonded storage ever since its founding in an area close to Beilun
port, one of China's four major deepwater ports.

Early this year, China abolished the preferential policy on
customs duty reduction and exemption for newly-built

The zone has seized the opportunity to expand its business by
encouraging the settlement of productive enterprises.

In addition, the zone has held a series of activities to

MANILA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
said here today that there is no need to call for a caucus among
the top leadership of his party to discuss the proposed amendments
to the 1987 constitution to allow the extension of his term.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his weekly press conference, Ramos said that his
ruling Lakas-Nucd (National Union for Christian Democrats) has
already made its position, and that is to concentrate on the
passage of vital legislative measures needed to make the country
even more competitive.
</P>
<P>
"Any discussion on amendments to the constitution and all
related issues could only diminish the goodwill, the time and the
energy away from our priority legislative agenda," he said.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Lakas-Nucd and some Congressmen are campaigning
for charter changes to allow the extension of Ramos' term, or his
re-election. but the campaign has met strong opposition in the
country.
</P>
<P>
"I will just pursue my top priority effort as president, which
is to make sure that our legislative agenda on our economic
restructuring, social reform, and political reform will be fully
in place," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- A mammoth mass parade along
with military march were held here today to celebrate the 34th
anniversary of Uganda's independence.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the nation to mark the Independence Day, President
Yoweri Museveni said, "we have now a democratic order because
early this year we elected the first president through universal
presidential elections."
</P>
<P>
"Members of parliament was also elected and we remain to elect
local government leaders," said the Ugandan president when
presiding over a huge celebration ceremony in the capital in
which South African President Nelson Mandela was present.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the economic achievements in the country, Museveni
said, Uganda exported only nine kinds of products 10 years ago
while at present it exports 25 products.
</P>
<P>
He said the exports of coffee, Uganda's main foreign exchange
earner, accounted for 97 percent of value of all the exports in
1986 when his administration came to power, but now the figure
has been reduced to only 64 percent.
</P>
<P>
"In mining area, we have 20 new mining companies," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Dwelling in the field of industries in general, Museveni said,
"we have received in the last six years alone proposals for the
setting up of 2,171 new projects. These are worth 2.8 billion
U.S. Dollars. out of all these, investments of 892 million US
Dollars have been put onto the ground."
</P>
<P>
However, he frowned on corruption and called on people to use
constitution as a weapon to fight against it in the country.
</P>
<P>
On relations with foreign countries, Museveni said Uganda has
been on good terms with all countries except Sudan, and it is
trying hard to see how to mend fences with its northern neighbor.
</P>
<P>
Both sides accuse the other of backing its rebels.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of people from all parts of the country as
well as diplomatic envoys accredited here attended the ceremony
which lasted for hours.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The French government has drawn a lesson from the recent
crisis of paperless immigrants in Saint-Bernard Church of Paris
that the Pasqua immigration law is inapplicable.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Jean-Louis Debre has presented a new draft
law on immigration which will correct the incoherences in the
Pasqua law, facilitate expulsion of illegal immigrants, reinforce
the power of police.
</P>
<P>
-- The IRA claimed responsibility Tuesday for the bomb attack
on the headquarters of British troops in Northern Ireland in
Lisburn, the first time that the military wing of the Sinn Fein in
the British province has done so since the IRA declared ceasefire
in August 1994. The attack has put an end to the peace process
engaged by both sides in the past two years.
</P>
<P>
-- For the first time in six years, a U.S. Secretary of State
is visiting Africa. Warren Christopher is discussing with African
leaders the democratic process of the continent, peace in the
Great Lake region of central Africa and Liberia, and the
succession to U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:

<HEADLINE> Roundup: US Wants to Form African Crisis Response </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher is on a five-nation African tour to promote
the U.S. proposal for the formation of an African Crisis Response
Force (ACRF), a senior official of the State Department said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs George
Moose said in Bamako on Tuesday Chiristopher's trip is intended
to underscore "the U.S. commitment to democracy" and economic
development in Africa and to discuss the formation of the ACRF.
</P>
<P>
The force would be sent to trouble-torn African countries to
intervene in the fighting by establishing safe areas where
civilians could gather and receive humanitarian assistance.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the formation of the ACRF will move forward very
expeditiously. We have been having discussions with our partners
in Europe and Africa for some time," Moose said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
"Now we hope to translate the proposal and ideas into concrete
operational reality," he added.
</P>
<P>
South Africa will be Chistopher's last leg of his African tour
which began in Mali on Monday. He will also visit Ethiopia,
Tanzania and Angola.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela will be briefed on the
ACRF as Chairman of the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) and commander-in-chief of Africa's strongest army.
</P>
<P>
The South African army has already been working with military
officers of SADC and Ghana and United Nations to prepare for
peacekeeping operations in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Moose claimed that a dozen other countries have responded
favorably to the formation of the ACRF.
</P>
<P>
"What we are proposing is a partnership between the U.S. and
Africa's other external partners to create a capacity to respond
more quickly to crisis situations in the continent," he said.
</P>
<P>
He cited the situation in Burundi, saying U.S. will continue
with its diplomatic initiatives in that small central African
state.
</P>
<P>
"But if our diplomacy fails, we must have some means to
respond, and in this case the ACRF will be the best solution,"
Moose asserted.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. official, the force will be strictly
used for humanitarian missions. It will provide zones where
civilians can be protected. It is not intended to impose peace on
warring factions, but to protect innocent civilians.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Northeast China's Liaoning
Province plans to invest 852 million yuan to harness two
"untameable" rivers, the Hunhe and the Daliao, in the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
Key projects on the construction list include a 537-km-long
embankment along the Daliao River, renovation of 70 dangerous
sections, afforestation on 4,000 ha of land and removal of 3.81
million cubic meters of river silt.
</P>
<P>
The project is designed to raise the flood-prevention capacity
of the two rivers from their current rate of one flood every ten
years to one every 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Liaoning will build nine major water conservancy
projects on the Liaohe and Daling Rivers in the next five
years. The total investment will be more than 4.8 billion yuan.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Moose said the ACRF would
cost between 25 and 45 million U.S. Dollars for the equipment and
training of the force. More money would be needed for its
deployment.
</P>
<P>
"We have our own financial obligations. We will pay our fair
share of that," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moose noted that while the U.S. has been the driving force
behind the formation of the ACRF, it has to involve the majority
of Africa's 53 states, all members of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
European Union member states have also been invited to get
involved. During the past months, Moose has visited almost half
of the African states and Europe to discuss the idea of the ACRF.
</P>
<P>
A State Department official said on Tuesday in Bamako, capital
of Mali, that the U.S. and European countries "were no longer
willing to commit their troops in African conflicts".
</P>
<P>
The United States got its fingers badly burned in 1993 when a
humanitarian mission to Somalia turned violent, leaving scores of
U. S. troop dead.
</P>
<P>
The last U.S. Secretary of State to visit Africa was James
Baker in 1990 whom Christopher succeeded in January 1992.
</P>
<P>
Critics of the foreign policy of President Clinton said the
fact that the African trip comes at the tail end of the
president's four-year term is a sign of his administration's
neglect of the continent since the end of the cold war.

<P>
HANOI, October 9 (Xinhua) -- A latest report from the

been 4,344 hiv carriers all over the country by mid-September.
</P>
<P>
Among those hiv carriers, 80 are foreigners. 353 developed full

</P>
<P>
According to NAC, most hiv carriers and aids cases are

of working age.
</P>
<P>
The number of hiv carriers who are drug addicts increased by 35
percent during the period of 1992 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
Ho Chi Minh City, the largest city of the country, ranked top
of the list of hiv carriers. Half of the country's hiv cases are
diagnosed in that economic booming city.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese National Institute of Hygiene and Epidemiology
predicted that the number of hiv carriers in Vietnam would be over
356,000 by the year 2000. The institute estimated that 15,000 hiv
carriers would be killed by the deadly disease by 2000.

CAIRO, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- A conference entitled "Islamic Banking and Finance,"
organized by the Islamic Banker Magazine and the International
Business Conferences Organization, will be held in Istanbul on
October 14-16.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's State Minister Abdullah Gul and Finance Minister
Abdullatif Sener will make speeches at the conference, which will
be held with the support of the pro-Islamic Independent
Industrialists' and Businessmen's Association (MUSIAD).
</P>
<P>
The techniques of and difficulties in developing and expanding
 banking without interest payments will be discussed.
</P>
<P>
Many Turkish and foreign financial specialists will attend
the conference.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Egyptian government will announce income tax cuts
within days, Finance Minister Mohi Eddin el-Gharib said here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He said that the cuts will apply to individuals and private
companies.
</P>
<P>
Gharib, however, pointed out that the cuts "will be gradual
and conditional on our success in stamping out tax evasion."
</P>
<P>
Egypt taxes individual salaries and profits from private
companies at 20 percent for the first 50,000 Egyptian pounds
(14,700 U.S. dollars) a year and 32 percent for amounts above
that threshold.
</P>
<P>
Gharib also confirmed that this month's cuts in import duties
did not apply to imports of cars likely to compete with locally
assembled models.
</P>
<P>
The import duty levied on large models of cars has fallen to
135 percent from 160 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
The import duty on small cars which compete with locally
assembled models remains at 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The Central Bank of Egypt said Tuesday that it sold
860.5 million Egyptian pounds (253.1 million U.S. dollars) worth
of medium-term treasury bills to 113 private and institutional
investors.
</P>
<P>
The 182-day bills sold Monday carry an average interest rate
of 10.257 percent, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the bank also invited bids for 91-day T-bills
valued at 176.4 million U.S. dollars for issue Thursday.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- A remarkable recession in foreign trade activities
registered in the first half of this year in Lebanon has
reflected economic stagnation in this country, the local daily
Ad-Diyar reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted statistics made by the Lebanese Central Bank
as reporting that the import in the first six months this year
reached 4,834 million dollars, the lowest level in the recent
four years.
</P>
<P>
Economic experts pointed out that the slump of import
reflected incapability of the local market to absorb more
importation as a result of a decline in the consumers' income and
purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
They also attributed the recession to a reluctance of banks to
provide loans to the foreign trade sector and of importers to
expand their business under the stagnation currently suffered by
Lebanon's economy.

<HEADLINE> India's Former PM Rao Granted Anticipatory Bail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Delhi High Court today
granted anticipatory bail to India's former prime minister P.V.
Narasimha Rao till October 14 when he will appear before the trial
court in the St. Kitts forgery case.
</P>
<P>
The high court also granted anticipatory bail to former union
minister K.K. Tewary and former enforcement director K.L. Verma.
</P>
<P>
Justice Mahajan allowed the three accused in the St. Kitts
forgery case to apply for regular bail after appearing before the
trial court.
</P>
<P>
Chief Metropolitan Magistrate (CMM) Prem Kumar issued
non-bailable arrest warrants on October 4 against the three
accused including Rao.
</P>
<P>
The Delhi High Court rejected the argument of Rao that it would
be futile to approach the trial court for bail as it has already
made up its mind regarding the accused.
</P>
<P>
It was alleged by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)
that Rao in conspiracy with others attested forged documents in an
attempt to make them genuine to show that Ajeya Singh, son of
former prime minister V.P. Singh, maintained a secret account in
the First Trust Corporation in the St. Kitts Islands in West
Indies and deposited 21 million US dollars in it during 1986-87.
</P>
<P>
The St. Kitts forgery case was first made public in 1990, but
the CBI did not make efforts to investigate it till this year.

<HEADLINE> China Not A "Threat" to World's Peace Under Any Circumstance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- China is not a "threat" to world
peace under any circumstances, and the so-called "China threat" is
utterly groundless, Chinese Defense Minister Chi Haotian said
today during a meeting with General Reynaldo Caceres,
Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
Chi, who is also vice-chairman of China's Central Military
Commission and a state councillor, said that China attaches great
importance to General Caceres's visit, and believed that it will
contribute to the improvement of mutual understanding and
cooperation between the two armies. It also will benefit the
development of bilateral ties, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chi expressed his satisfaction with the stable and healthy
development of bilateral ties since the two established diplomatic
relations. He said that he appreciates Bolivia's active role in
advancing Latin America's stability, peace, and development, and
its independent diplomatic policies.
</P>
<P>
Chi also briefed the guests on China's independent foreign
policy of peace, its defensive national defense policy and its
achievements in recent years in the drive of reform and opening-up.
</P>
<P>
Chi pointed out that China's development contributes greatly to
the cause of world peace and development, and the country's
growing strength is an important force in global stability.
</P>
<P>
China is not a "threat" to world peace and the so-called "China
threat" is groundless, Chi emphasized, adding that "China never
stations a single soldier abroad, and has no overseas military
base."
</P>
<P>
Caceres highly praised the dramatic changes in China since his
first China tour in 1987. He said that China's developments are
many-sided, and that both politics and the military have witnessed
tremendous progress, while the economic development has attracted
worldwide attention.
</P>
<P>
Caceres agreed with Chi's views, saying he hopes to
continuously strengthen exchanges and cooperation between the two
armies.
</P>
<P>
Caceres arrived in Beijing on October 6 to start his China
trip.

XI'AN, October 9 (Xinhua) -- A production line to make
corrosive-resistant steel tubing has gone into operation at Baoji
Petroleum Steel Tubing Plant in northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The equipment uses up-to-date technology imported from the

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government has
instructed its commercial attaches at embassies worldwide to
repair the damage caused by the recent Israeli-Palestinian
violence, a report said today.
</P>
<P>
Director of Foreign Trade Administration of Industry and Trade
Ministry Zohar Peri has requested that attaches immediately begin
a promotional campaign to show foreign companies the positive side
of Israel's economy, the English daily The Jerusalem Post said.
</P>
<P>
The attaches will compile reports on the current attitudes
toward Israel in their host countries and attempt to establish if
any visits have been postponed or canceled, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Following the Israeli-Palestinian violence which killed 75
people two weeks ago, Israeli business community worried about
the possible adverse effects on international trade.
</P>
<P>
Some experts said that, if there was any more foot-dragging on
the peace process, the effects on Israel's economy could be
catastrophic. They foresaw a major pullout of foreign investors
and the possible reimplementation of the Arab boycott.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years when Israel was bent on making peace
with Palestinians and Arab countries, a huge flow of foreign
investments have been attracted into the Jewish state, boosting
its economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ministry officials said that presidents of 28 of
Japan's largest corporations have still not confirmed plans to
visit Israel following the Cairo economic summit in November.
</P>
<P>
Former ministry director general Yosi Snir confirmed in
August that the visit of the senior executives from companies,
including Fujitsu, NEC Corp., Sumitomo Corp., Mitsubishi's banking
and industrial divisions, Tomen Corp. and Fuji Bank Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Oded Eran, deputy Director-General for Economic Affairs of
Foreign Ministry, said that the Japanese companies have not
canceled their visit, but they have not confirmed the trip
either.

minister at his time of greatest need Tuesday, declaring that it
had never been more important to return the Conservatives to
office and John Major to Downing Street.

</P>

Financial Times:

</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:

<HEADLINE> Bold Reform Facilitates Transportation on Hainan Island </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Bold reform measures are turning
the transportation sector of Hainan Island in south China into a
more market-oriented industry.
</P>
<P>
The provincial authorities consider a good transportation
system vital to the economic development of Hainan, the country's
second-largest island, which was separated from wealthy Guangdong
Province and became the country's largest special economic zone in
1988.
</P>
<P>
Though it was part of Guangdong, Hainan has lagged behind
economically, partly due to inadequate transportation facilities.
</P>
<P>
Provincial authorities, who believe that relying on the market
mechanism is an effective way to enhance transportation, recently
took bold steps to eliminate all of the government highway bureaus
and replace them with highway maintenance companies.
</P>
<P>
"This is in line with the policy of having a small government
and big society, which is aimed at improving economic efficiency,"
an official pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Under a reform plan outlined in 1994, the province dismantled
the excessive outposts on highways and cut a variety of tolls into
one, thus raising the efficiency to a great degree.
</P>
<P>
And in 1993, another measure resulted in the replacement of the
government port office with a sole port authority, who is a legal
person.
</P>
<P>
The province has also been actively opening up its highway and
waterway transportation markets to operators in and outside the
province.
</P>
<P>
Investment from various sources has also been sought for
construction of more highways and airports.

<HEADLINE> Huaihe River Harnessing Proved Effective </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Great efforts made in the past
five years to harness the Huaihe River, China's third largest,
have paid off.
</P>
<P>
To date, 18,000 square kilometers or one-third of the total
soil erosion area in the region irrigated by the upper reaches of
the Huaihe River have been harnessed.
</P>
<P>
More than 5,300 small-scaled reservoirs, with a total storage
capacity of 25 billion cubic meters, have been built in small
river valleys along the upper reaches of the Huaihe River. The
storage capacity can guarantee the needs of agricultural and
industrial production in the region.
</P>
<P>
Tunnels for discharging floods in the middle reaches of the
Huaihe River have been expanded from 300-800 meters to 1,500-2,000
meters.
</P>
<P>
With more water-discharging tunnels built, the water discharge
capacity of the Huaihe River system into the sea has reached
16,000 cubic meters per second.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of water-discharging tunnels and stations
have also been built in the plain area along the Huaihe River,
which improved some 6.7 million hectares of waterlogged farmland
and 80 percent of about 1.53 million hectares of saline-alkali
farmland.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, some 700,000 motor-pumped wells have been sunk,
which irrigate 7.3 million hectares of farmland, accounting for
more than 55 percent of total arable acreage in the region
irrigated by the Huaihe River.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the region now has 274 million hectares of rice land.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the harnessing of the Huaihe River mainstream and the
construction of a group of navigation channels, the total length
of navigation channels in the Huaihe River system has exceeded
20,000 km, with over 90 million tons of cargo handled annually.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Foreign Trade Slumps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 9 (Xinhua) -- A remarkable recession in
foreign trade activities registered in the first half of this
year in Lebanon has reflected economic stagnation in this
country, the local daily Ad-Diyar reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted statistics made by the Lebanese Central Bank
as reporting that the import in the first six months this year
reached the lowest level in the recent four years.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics, the import volume by the end of
June amounted to 4,834 million dollars, as compared with 7,033
million dollars in the same period in 1995, 5,990 million dollars
in 1994 and 4,939 million dollars in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Economic experts pointed out that the slump of import
reflected incapability of the local market to absorb more
importation as a result of a decline in the consumers' income and
purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
They also attributed the recession to a reluctance of banks to
provide loans to the foreign trade sector and of importers to
expand their business under the stagnation currently suffered by
Lebanon's economy.

XI'AN, October 9 (Xinhua) -- A production line to make
corrosive-resistant steel tubing has gone into operation at the
Baoji Petroleum Steel Tubing Plant in northwest China's Shaanxi
Province.
</P>
<P>
The equipment uses up-to-date technology imported from the
Netherlands at a cost of more than 40 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The production line replaced asphalt and tar, with trislope
epoxy polythene as tube coating. The new corrosive-resistant
technology will help to prolong the service span of pipelines.
</P>
<P>
The line has a designed annual capacity of 1.12 million square
meters of coated tubing, with an output value of more than 200
million yuan.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Industry Grew 12.9 Percent During January-September Period </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- China saw the added value of its
industry register 1,357.5 billion yuan during the first three
quarters this year, up 12.9 percent from the same period of 1995,
the State Statistics Bureau announced today.
</P>
<P>
The bureau said in a report that the growth of the industry has
been slowing down gradually since the beginning of the year, with
the state sector lagging behind the non-state sector.
</P>
<P>
During the first nine months, the light industry's added value
rose 13.3 percent to 553.3 billion yuan on a yearly basis, while
the heavy industry's added value rose 12.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report said that 31 of the 50 major light industrial goods,
such as cameras, video machines, air conditioners and hi-fi
systems, enjoyed different levels of growth.
</P>
<P>
Output of bicycles, sewing machines, radios, recorders, and
major textile goods decreased during the same period.
</P>
<P>
The report said that China's energy and raw materials
production kept a steady rise during the January-September period,
with coal and crude oil output rising eight percent and 6.2
percent respectively on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
The majority of investment-type machinery products, such as
industrial boilers and power generating sets, suffered falls in
production.
</P>
<P>
However, production of computers and program-controlled
telephone exchanges increased by more than 20 percent during the
first nine months.

<HEADLINE> Science Helps Farmers to Become Better Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, October 9 (Xinhua) -- About 180,000 rural households in
east China's Dabieshan Mountain area now have plenty to eat and
wear these days, thanks to science.
</P>
<P>
Projects made possible by the use of science and technology
have alleviated poverty.
</P>
<P>
The project area covers six counties in the Dabieshan Mountain
area in Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
The State Science and Technology Commission first launched
poverty alleviation projects through the development of science
and technology in the Dabieshan Mountain area in 1986.
</P>
<P>
During the past 10 years, the commission sent many science and
technology cadres to the project area, and allocated 5.19 million
yuan to develop 65 poverty alleviation projects.
</P>
<P>
Anhui Province also invested 13.68 million yuan in the area over
the past decade. The Anhui Provincial Science and Technology
Committee and the Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences sent
more than 100 scientific workers to the project region to help
farmers.
</P>
<P>
During this period, more than 1,800 training sessions were held,
attended by more than 90,000 local farmers.
</P>
<P>
With the help of science and technology, eight pillar industries
related to the production of silk, tea production and processing,
the breeding of white geese, and orange cultivation have been set
up in the project area.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the industries have produced some 100
million yuan in output value annually, with their net income
exceeding 28 million yuan. Local farmers can bring in a net income
of over 38 million yuan from the industries.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Call for Arafat-Netanyahu Meeting to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian negotiators are
demanding a meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in a bid to break
the deadlock in peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators from the two sides continue talks today at the
Palestinian side of the Erez checkpoint between Israel and the
Gaza Strip, although no tangible progress has been made after
first three days of the talks which resumed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted a senior Palestinian negotiator as saying
that, as a wide gap remained between the two sides, there was no
other alternative than holding a Netanyahu-Arafat meeting.
</P>
<P>
The leading obstacle remains the issue of Israel's
long-delayed redeployment from the volatile West Bank town of
Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Israel reportedly demanded that "practical implementation" of
the redeployment should take into account of the security needs
of the 450 Jewish settlers living among the 120,000 Palestinians
in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Israeli negotiators also proposed reducing the size of the
Palestinian police forces who should be armed with only pistols
instead of automatic weapons. Israel is particularly concerned
about the issue after Palestinian policemen exchanged fire with
Israeli soldiers in the bloodshed two weeks ago, which killed 75
people including 15 Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
However, the Palestinian side refused any attempt to alter
the signed agreement on Hebron redeployment. Instead, Palestinian
negotiators proposed setting up a joint headquarter in the town
and increasing joint patrols after the redeployment so as to
solve the security issue.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat even proposed Israel
evacuating the Jewish settlers in Hebron, if it was so concerned
about the security issue. But Israeli negotiators rejected the
idea right of hand, citing the long history of the Jewish
residents in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the Palestinian delegation reportedly walked out
of the talks in protest over Israel's proposal on Israeli
troops' right to pursue terrorists in areas under Palestinian
total control. They only returned after the intervention of
U.S. special envoy Dennis Ross.
</P>
<P>
Senior Palestinian negotiator Hasan Asfour said Tuesday that
he hoped the U.S. envoy would put forward some feasible
proposals to bridge the wide gap between the parties.
</P>
<P>
The talks, endangered by the bloodshed two weeks ago, resumed
Sunday only after the direct intervention by U.S. President Bill
Clinton, who convened the summit between Netanyahu, Arafat and
Jordanian King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Asfour said he was disappointed with the Americans who failed
to play a more active role in the talks to urge Israel to honor
the signed agreements. Ross, who joined the discussions,
maintained that he would serve as a facilitator and only
intervened when the talks were deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Coordinator in the Territories Oren Shahor
warned Tuesday that the failure of the talks could lead to
another flare-up of violence which could end the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to the economic difficulties in Palestinian self-rule
 areas, Shahor said there was widespread frustration among the
Palestinians, including Arafat who was disappointed with the
lack of U.S. aid.
</P>
<P>
He did not rule out many possible causes for a flare-up,
including a struggle between rival Palestinian groups or even a
road accident, as taking place with the 1987-1993 intifada (Arab
uprising).
</P>
<P>
In another development, 10,000 Palestinian workers today were
allowed into Israel to work as the first partial lifting of the
total closure re-imposed on the Palestinian self-rule areas after
the recent violence.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Hangzhou Railway Bureau has
introduced a series of measures to attract more travelers, in a
bid to meet head-on competition from air and road transport.
</P>
<P>
The bureau, which operates railway transport in east China's
Zhejiang Province, is the first to start a service known as the
"green passage" in China.
</P>
<P>
The passage is open 24 hours a day beside the departure point
at Hangzhou railway station. Passengers who do not have enough
time to purchase train tickets can get into the station through
this passage, board trains guided by the staff, and then buy their
tickets on the train.
</P>
<P>
The station also promises that passengers taking short-distance
journeys can board trains any time within one hour prior to its
departure.
</P>
<P>
Electronic ticket machines have been installed in all the
ticket offices at the station. It now takes only six seconds to
sell a ticket, compared to the 22 seconds it previously took. The
computers will soon be linked, ensuring that all train tickets are
available at any office in the city.
</P>
<P>
A computerized cargo transport system has also been installed,
which has simplified the procedures for cargo consignment.
</P>
<P>
New services also include the opening of more ticket offices,
and the increase of train speeds.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Produces 21,000 Tons of Wheat in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon has produced some 21,000
tons of wheat this year, or 5 percent of the country's annual
requirement, the local daily Nida Al-Watan today quoted an
official in the Ministry of Economy as saying.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the government bought some 16,000 tons
of wheat from the local farmers and "the total yield did not
exceed 21,000 tons in 1996, which is the same level in the recent
years."
</P>
<P>
The farmers also sold several tons to the private sector or
reserved some of the harvest for themselves, the official in the
Grain and Beet Office in the Ministry of Economy added.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon Produced 20,000 tons of wheat in 1995, 21,000 tons in
1994 and about 25,000 tons in 1993, and the annual demand of this
country amounts to 400,000 tons, most of which should be imported
from the United States and Europe, the Grain and Beet Office said,
</P>
<P>
In addition to the 16,000 tons bought from the local farmers,
there is also some 80,000 tons stored by the government, and "I
believe these volumes are enough to meet the demands in the next
three months," the official noted.
</P>
<P>
Since this year, the Grain and Beet Office has bought some
200,000 tons of wheat through local agents of foreign companies,
which represents half of Lebanon's annual demand of wheat, the
official said.
</P>
<P>
"The private sector usually buys the remaining half of the
country's requirement of wheat and until now it has bought 75,000
tons," the official underlined. "It is still unclear how much the
private sector is determined to buy this year."
</P>
<P>
Lebanon is a traditionally famous exporter of vegetables and
fruits in the Middle East, but its requirements for grain are met
mainly by import.

<HEADLINE> Retrenchees to Have Cash Support in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The government has
decided to set up a Reeployment Trust Fund (RTF) with an initial
capital of one billion Tanzania Shillings (1.65 million US
Dollars) to help civil service retrenchees start business.
</P>
<P>
According to a local newspaper today, Dodoma Regional
Executive Secretary Clemence Rutaihwa said this in Dodoma on
Tuesday when opening a week-long workshop for the retrenchees
drawn from Dodoma and Singida regions.

The regional executive secretary told 48 participants that the
main objective of the World Bank funded program was to have a
small size but highlya efficient and well paid civil service.
</P>
<P>
He said that the fund would provide soft loans to the
redundant workers as seed money so that the established
self-employed projects that would sustain the rest of their
lives.
</P>
<P>
Rutaihwa said that the retrenchees would also be provided with
technical advice on how to operate their projects successfully.
</P>
<P>
He, however, cautioned the retrenchees that available
resources are always little compared to demands and they should
therefore use the meager seed money for gainful activities.

<HEADLINE> China Publishes Rules on Rights Registration of Overseas Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- China has issued detailed
provisional rules on the management of the registration of the
rights of state-owned property outside the country.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at getting a thorough knowledge of such
state-owned assets.
</P>
<P>
The rules, issued by the State Administration of State Property
(SASP), say that all enterprises and non-operational institutions
registered overseas must register the rights of their state-owned
property.
</P>
<P>
Overseas Chinese enterprises refer to those economic entities
set up by domestic investors in places outside China, including
Hong Kong and Macao. China currently has 4,739 such enterprises.
</P>
<P>
An SASP official said that the enterprises have played a
positive role in boosting China's foreign trade and helping
domestic enterprises to become competitive on the international
market.
</P>
<P>
"However, grave problems have cropped up in the management of
state-owned assets in these enterprises due to inadequate policies
for this sector," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The problems include poor management, unwise investment
decisions, unawareness of investment risks, hostile cut-price
competition among exporters, registering state-owned assets under
the name of individuals and poor economic performance of
enterprises, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Overseas non-operational institutions refer to Chinese
embassies, consulates, media, and other non-profitable missions
and representative offices.
</P>
<P>
The SASP, on behalf of the central government, will register
the property rights held by institutions outside China. It will
also confirm the legal activities concerning the State's ownership
of overseas state-owned property, as well as concerning the
possession and running of overseas state-owned property by
overseas Chinese institutions.
</P>
<P>
The provincial-level departments overseeing the administration
of state property will be held responsible for property rights
registration in the overseas institutions set up by the
governments or departments of their respective regions.
</P>
<P>
Chinese institutions that violate the rules will be punished
accordingly by the state property administrations departments, the
SASP said.

<HEADLINE> China to Adopt New Regulation on Funds Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- A new regulation is expected to
appear soon to standardize the management of funds in China's
securities market, according to an official magazine published by
the State Planning Commission.
</P>
<P>
"The adoption of the new regulation will be a signal that the
freeze over the funds market will thaw," securities analysts said,
adding that numerous funds will then actively seek to be listed on
Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
"The long-awaited regulation was designed in keeping with the
state's policy of encouraging enterprises to raise capital from
the securities market instead of lending solely from the banks,"
the official said.
</P>
<P>
The regulation will foster more institutional investors and
boost the fledgling stock market, the official added.
</P>
<P>
Expected to mainly regulate the management of funds in stocks
and bonds, the new rule will stipulate that funds in the
securities market should be jointly approved and managed by the
central bank, the State Council Securities Commission, and the
China Securities Regulatory Commission.
</P>
<P>
Only legal securities companies, and trust and investment
companies are qualified to apply for the establishment of funds,
and at least one million yuan have to be raised for each fund,
according to the regulation.
</P>
<P>
The regulation stipulates that each fund should invest no less
than 20 percent of its capital in state treasury bonds, with the
money invested in stocks and bonds staying at least at 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
The SPC magazine also disclosed that the new regulation was
almost four years in the making and has undergone more than 10
revisions since the State Council ordered the central bank to
begin drafting it at the end of 1992.
</P>
<P>
While encouraging more capital to flow into the securities
market, China will delay the drafting of the regulation on the
management of funds that are invested in industries, in a bid to
cool down the development of such funds, the SPC magazine said.
</P>
<P>
Central bank figures showed that by the end of September in
1995, 75 funds had been established, and almost half of them had
investment in industries. Three invested solely in industries and
18 put more than 50 percent of their money into the industrial
sector.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Backs Regional Economic Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Harare, October 9 (xinhua) -- South Africa backs regional
economic integration and plans to ratify the controversial
Southern African Development Community (SADC) trade protocol next
year or in 1998, Deputy Foreign minister aziz pahad said.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Zimbabwe National News Agency here on
Tuesday, Pahad said the signing of the SADC trade agreement was
an indication of his country's commitment to promote trade and
economic links with other southern African countries.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's exports to Africa rose a dozen-fold from 1987
to 1994, reaching 6.3 billion U.S. Dollars, while stagnant
imports hovered at an annual average 1.6 billion US Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Pahad said, ''we are a new government. We have only been in
power for two and a half years. We have had to deal with
tremendous problems, but to show our commitment to intra-regional
trade, we signed the SADC protocol which gives us eight years to
establish free trade.''
</P>
<P>
''We are keen to ratify the agreement and we hope to do it
either during this parliamentary session which ends in September
next year or the next session,'' Pahad said.
</P>
<P>
SADC countries signed the trade agreement in August this year.
The main objectives of the protocol are to facilitate, increase
and promote intra-SADC trade by eliminating tariffs and
non-tariffs barriers, and allowing free and fair trade among SADC
countries.
</P>
<P>
On allegations that the whites in South Africa, who still
control the economy, were the ones employing delaying tactics to
slow down the ongoing trade negotiations, Pahad said all South
Africans were committed to signing the long-awaited agreement.
</P>
<P>
''I don't believe that there was a conspiracy to slow down the
trade negotiations. We all appreciate that Zimbabwe is crucial to
South Africa because it is our 11th trading partner in the
world,'' He said.

<P>
SHANGHAI, October 9 (Xinhua) -- British insurance company,
General Accident, today inaugurated its second Chinese
representative office in Shanghai, the country's leading
industrial and commercial center.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, foreign insurance companies have
established more than 30 offices in the metropolis.

General Accident, with 35 billion US dollars of assets, was
founded in Scotland in 1885, and is mainly engaged in nonlife

<P>
NEW DELHI, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The year 1996-97 is likely to
end with a lower rate of industrial and export growth and a higher
fiscal and trade deficit as compared with 1995-96, the Associated
Chambers of Commerce and Industry of India (AssoCham) said today.
</P>
<P>
Industrial growth in the current financial year is expected to
reach around 10 percent as compared with 12 percent in 1995-96.
The shortfall is attributed to the continuing high cost of
borrowings, a slump in primary capital market, infrastructural
bottlenecks and sluggish import of several key raw material items.
</P>
<P>
The data for the first four months of 1996-97 indicated a
slowdown of exports to 11 percent, well below the 28 percent
increase during the same period of 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit of 4.5 billion US dollars in 1995-96 is
likely to increase to 6-7 billion US dollars in 1996-97. This will
strain the balance of payment position, making foreign investment
inflows of 7-8 billion US dollars vital for financing the deficit
on external account.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Foreign Exchange Reserves on Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 9 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's official foreign
exchange reserves have been declining for three months due to the
expanding current account deficit, the Bank of Korea said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The country's official foreign exchange reserves held by the
Bank of Korea, South Korea's central bank, totaled 32.84 billion
U.S. dollars by the end of last month, 3.4 billion dollars fewer
than the sum recorded at the end of last June.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, South Korea's official foreign
exchange holdings stood at 32.71 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The decline of foreign exchange holdings was attributed to the
swelling current account deficit and the sluggish introduction of
foreign capital like foreigners' stock investment funds, a bank
official said.
</P>
<P>
During the first eight months of this year, South Korea's
current account deficit amounted to 15.24 billion dollars, which
more than doubled the 7.33 billion dollars of the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
The current account comprises trade in goods and services as
well as investment income and government payments.

</P>
<P>
The 24-day rear-area field training exercise, the 31st of its

"Foal Eagle" is designed to test rear-area protection
operations and major command, control and communication systems as
well as provide hands-on experience for forces of the two
countries, according to the USFK.

The exercise will involve most of the South Korean troops and
some 37,000 U.S. soldiers stationed in South Korea, it added.

The exhibition will be held in South Africa next month.

SHANGHAI, October 8 (Xinhua) -- An unceasing rain in Shanghai
over the past two days has brought some relief to the hot dry
weather that has besieged the city for September, which was the
second hottest autumn month since the city began recording

0.3 degrees lower than the hottest temperature in the same period

<HEADLINE> Rabbani, Dostum Likely to Join Hands Against Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The deposed Afghan President
Burhanuddin Rabbani was holding talks with Rashid Dostum, leader
of Uzbek Militia, on the possibility of joining hands against the
Taliban Militia, said reports reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The reports said Rabbani arrived in Dostum's headquarters
Mazar-i-Sharif in northern Afghanistan Tuesday and was accorded a
warm welcome by Dostum.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani and Dostum, who had been hostile to each other for a
long time, embraced in public and then held a crucial meeting, the
details of which were not available yet.
</P>
<P>
However, Masood Khalili, a spokesman for Rabbani in New Delhi,
was quoted as saying that Rabbani and Dostum held talks on
reorganizing their forces for a counter-attack against the
Taliban, and an alliance between Rabbani and Dostum was set up.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani and Dostum did not deny Khalili's statement, but no
formal agreement has been revealed.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believed that such an alliance is quite possible.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani had held talks with Dostum's representatives in Baghlan
province on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani's arrival in Mazar-i-Sharif also indicates a change of
heart by Dostum who had refused to let Rabbani visit
Mazar-i-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Taliban have sent heavy reinforcements to the
northern frontline against Dostum's forces, and a Taliban
commander was quoted as saying that Dostum's troops had advanced
towards Taliban positions but were repulsed.
</P>
<P>
Another report said that Dostum's forces had secretly given a
route for Rabbani's troops to attack the Taliban, but it was not
confirmed yet.
</P>
<P>
A large number of Taliban fighters stationed near the strategic
Salang Tunnel, about 120 km north of Kabul, were confronting
Dostum's men and attacking Rabbani's troops in the Panjshir Valley
adjacent to the Tunnel.

they have proved that ginseng, a widely-used traditional Chinese
medicine, contains an anti-aging ingredient.
</P>
<P>
Yu Yingyan, an expert at Hebei Medical Sciences University and
Zhang Daxian, an expert at Shanghai University of Traditional
Chinese Medicine, have discovered that ginseng can remove highly
toxic chemicals in the human body which contribute to aging.
</P>
<P>
For thousands of years, the Chinese have regarded ginseng as a
tonic which can enhance health and prolong life.
</P>
<P>
The two scientists, who have medical degrees from Japan, said
that after repeated experiments with high-tech equipment, they
have proved that a harmful molecule resulting from the use of
oxygen can lead to disease and speed up the aging process.
</P>
<P>
The discovery is regarded as a major breakthrough in the
research of ginseng's usefulness, the scientists said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Tend to Find Jobs through Markets, not Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese workers, who for years
have enjoyed assigned and guaranteed jobs for life, are turning
for employment with emerging labor markets.
</P>
<P>
"Nine out of ten of the new labor forces found their jobs
through labor markets in 1995," said an official with the
country's Personnel Ministry in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The few who still enjoy the state's special treatment of job
assignments are demobilized soldiers and college graduates, he
said in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The market economic system is dramatically changing the role
of the government in the allocation of human resources, and giving
ground to labor markets, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Government functions have had to be redefined as formulating
policies and providing services, he added.
</P>
<P>
Under the guidance of the government, labor markets of various
kinds, and with complete range of functions and services, have
been set up across the country.
</P>
<P>
So-called "talent markets" have been designed to serve mainly
professional, technical and management personnel, "labor service
markets" serve ordinary laborers, and "markets of specialized
talents" meet special demands, such as the markets of
enterpreneurs and markets of chemical experts.
</P>
<P>
Statistics reveal that at the start of 1995, China had over
29,000 employment service organizations, which offered jobs to
over 12 million people last year alone.
</P>
<P>
The official said that with the abolition of the so-called
"iron-rice-bowl," Chinese people are acquiringing a new concept on
employment.
</P>
<P>
People tend to change their posts faster than ever, and the
scale, speed and scope of labor flows are accelerating.
</P>
<P>
The latest figure the department released said that over 11.5
million urban workers found new employers in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"Moving from one company to another several times in a few
years is simply no surprise to anybody today," Xinhua was told.
</P>
<P>
To date, more than 50 million rural laborers have entered
cities and towns to take jobs, and about 9 million urban dwellers
have gone to work in rural enterprises or with agricultural
undertakings.
</P>
<P>
The traditional one-way flow of laborers from the countryside
to cities has been replaced by a two-way flow, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He said the country will encourage the non-governmental sector
to run labor service agencies, in addition to the government, but
only on the condition that they are under effective macro-level
control by the government.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Shahabuddin Ahmed, New President of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Shahabuddin was declared elected the president unopposed on
July 23 as he was the only candidate nominated by the ruling Awami
League.
</P>
<P>
But he denied that he relished the victory.
</P>
<P>
"I was never enthusiastic for the post," but "I agreed to be
elevated to the highest seat of the republic for the interest of
democratic process and parliamentary system," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Though Shahabuddin was nominated for the presidency by the
ruling party, he neither is an Awami League member nor has any
political identity or leanings.
</P>
<P>
His choice as the new president has been generally accepted by
people of all shades of political views who expect him to be as
fair and neutral as he has been known in the past.
</P>
<P>
Regarded by the general public as a saint, Shahabuddin was
appointed vice-president of the republic as a nominee of all
political parties in December 1990 when the then President Hossain
Mohammad Ershad was under heavy pressure to resign.
</P>
<P>
Three months later, Shahabuddin became the acting president
after the military ruler was forced to step down.
</P>
<P>
During the "transition of power," Justice Shahabuddin won
reputation as a neutral and fair caretaker president and earned
acclaim for fairly conducting the parliamentary elections in
February 1991.
</P>
<P>
Born in 1930 to a renowned social worker and philanthropist
family in a village of the Mymensingh district in the north,
Shahabuddin got a bachelor's degree in economics in 1951 and a
master's degree in international relations later from Dhaka
University.
</P>
<P>
After he entered the profession of law and justice, Shahabuddin
had devoted himself to the cause. He became a judge in the High
Court in January 1972 and was promoted to be a judge in the
Appellate Tribunal of the Supreme Court in February 1980. In
January 1990, he began to serve as the chief justice of the
Supreme Court until he retired in 1995.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Shahabuddin was chairman of the Bangladesh Red
Cross Society from August 1978 to April 1982.
</P>
<P>
As the chief executive of the society, he reorganized and
practically rebuilt the society and earned wide applause for the
society's successful implementation of a number of emergency
relief operations and a cyclone preparedness program.
</P>
<P>
Shahabuddin and his wife have two sons and two daughters.

<HEADLINE> Japan's August Current Account Surplus Falls Sharply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Japan's current account surplus
for August fell by 28.9 percent from a year earlier to 4.61
billion U.S. dollars due to the continued rise in imports, the
Finance Ministry said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The drop in the surplus of the current account balance, which
measures the flow of goods and services as well as investment
income and other monetary transfers, was also attributed to an
increase in spending by Japanese traveling abroad, the ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
Except in August 1995, Japan's monthly current account surplus
has continued to fall since December 1994.
</P>
<P>
The surplus in Japanese goods and services trade plunged by
92.5 percent to 230 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The nation posted a surplus of 5.68 billion dollars in
merchandise trade, down by 27.8 percent, the ministry said in a
preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the services trade incurred a deficit of 5.44
billion dollars, compared with the 4.08 billion dollars deficit a
year before, according to the ministry.

<HEADLINE> Leading Officials Must Learn Legal Knowledge: Jiang Zemin (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang, who is also the general secretary of the CPC Central
Committee, said that promoting progress in a socialist democracy
and the introduction of a socialist legal system are arduous
projects, and completing them will require unremitting efforts by
the whole Party and the entire Chinese population.
</P>
<P>
"During the current historical period, we must adhere to and
improve our Party's leadership over various undertakings," he
said.
</P>
<P>
To this end, it is imperative that the Party's propositions
become the national will through legal procedures and that Party
organizations and members lead the people in implementing the
Party's line, principles and policies.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that implementing China's Constitution and laws
means acting in accordance with people's will and also constitutes
an important guarantee for implementing the Party's line,
principles and policies.
</P>
<P>
"We are now speeding up the establishment of a socialist market
economic structure, which inevitably requires the introduction of
a perfect and compatible socialist legal system," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative to introduce and perfect a legal system, under
which the government will be able to guide and standardize
economic operations, maintain a good economic order and exercise
macro-economic controls and management.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, leading officials at all levels must master
rudimentary legal knowledge, especially knowledge of laws
governing economic affairs, in order to employ legal means to
ensure and promote the sound development of a socialist market
economy.
</P>
<P>
The leader noted that making a success of the current campaign
to spread general knowledge among all citizens will help
accelerate the introduction of a legal system in China, step up
the reform, open China wider to the outside world, speed up
economic growth, intensify the anti-corruption campaign and
safeguard social stability.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe and South Africa have
agreed to speed up trade talks after the end of a two-day joint
commission.
</P>
<P>
The commission was described as a tremendous success by the
high-ranking officials from the two countries. But no firm dates
were agreed on for relaxation of South Africa's protective trade
regime with Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
According to the minutes of the meeting released here on

Instead, negotiations in economic, scientific, technical and
cultural spheres of cooperation will continue at least for the
time being.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed that the outstanding issues of the trade
negotiations on agriculture and others be resolved and signed as
soon as possible and they further noted that any outstanding
issues be resolved through negotiations.
</P>
<P>
On textile and clothing, where tariffs were lowered recently,
the commission agreed that the matter be reviewed once the agreed
quota of Zimbabwean imports had been met.
</P>
<P>
On agriculture, the meeting agreed to urge relevant government
officials to urgently convene to remove the 35 percent duty on
Zimbabwean agricultural exports to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The two countries agreed to expedite the conclusion of a
cultural agreement to enhance cultural exchange.
</P>
<P>
Both sides reviewing immigration matters agreed on the need
for an official extradition treaty, and on easing visa
requirements for business people and the issue of temporary
employment permits for key persons and for study visits.
</P>
<P>
Under environment and tourism, Zimbabwe and South Africa
agreed to promote environmental policies that were sustainable.
</P>
<P>
On politics, diplomacy and security, bilateral meetings were
agreed on as a means of enhancing cooperation.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
has called on all officials, particularly leading officials at all
levels, to learn more about China's laws and legal system.
</P>
<P>
In the preface to the book titled "Rudimentary Knowledge of
the Socialist Legal System," Jiang wrote, "This is what we need to
improve our leadership and managerial capabilities, and what we
need to lead the people in studying, applying and conscientiously
abiding by laws."
</P>
<P>
The leader urged that the study of legal knowledge be
systemized throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
He asked officials at all levels to substantially increase
their legal knowledge and improve their ability to perform their
duties according to law.
</P>
<P>
He noted that carrying forward socialist democracy, advancing
progress in introducing a socialist legal system and following the
principle of governing China according to law is a "major
component" of Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics, as well as a fundamental task for
China's modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the principle of governing China according to
law means that led by the Communist Party of China (CPC), all
kinds of government work are legalized and standardized and that
the people participate in managing state affairs, and economic,
cultural and social affairs through various forms and channels.
</P>
<P>
"We must make sure that laws are abided by, laws are enforced
strictly and those who break the law are punished, so that various
undertakings will grow along the orbit of a socialist legal
system," he said.
</P>
<P>
He described this as essential to enabling China's economy to
grow in a sustained, rapid and sound manner, advancing social
progress and ensuring the country's long-term stability and
prosperity.

<HEADLINE> Order on Rao's Bail Plea Likely Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Delhi High Court is likely
to pronounce its order on former prime minister P.V. Narasimha
Rao's anticipatory bail plea in the St Kitts forgery case
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Justice Mahajan in the High Court said Monday that the order
was reserved for one or two days.
</P>
<P>
Along with Rao's plea, an order will also be made on the
anticipatory bail applications of former union minister K.K.
Tewary and former enforcement director K.L. Verma.
</P>
<P>
All the three accused in the forgery case were facing
non-bailable arrest warrants issued by chief metropolitan
magistrate (CMM) Prem Kumar on last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The CMM, after taking cognizance of the chargesheet filed by
the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), had asked the
authorities to make the accused appear before his court on October
14. But the High Court Monday directed the authorities not to
arrest the accused till the pronouncement of the judgment on the
bail pleas of the three accused.
</P>
<P>
It was alleged by the CBI that Rao and others conspired in
forging the bank documents in First Trust Corporation at St Kitts
islands in West Indies to defame former prime minister V.P. Singh
and his son Ajeya Singh.
</P>
<P>
The CBI had vehemently opposed the anticipatory bail
applications, saying that the non-bailable arrest warrants issued
against the accused by the trial court was legally right.

SINGAPORE, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Stock Exchange of
Singapore (SES) and the Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) will launch
a new regional stock market index next Tuesday, the SES announced.
</P>
<P>
In a statement received today, the SES said that the new index,
called the Business Times Singapore Regional Index, or BT-SRI,
will allow investors and fund managers to track the performance of
their investments in regional stocks listed here.
</P>
<P>
The SES said that the introduction of the BT-SRI was part of
its strategy to develop itself into a regional exchange.
</P>
<P>
"In this connection, the SES has in the past years implemented
various measures to attract foreign and domestic companies with
substantial business operations in Asia to be listed on the
Exchange," it said.
</P>
<P>
The BT-SRI, the first of its kind in Asia, was the result of a
growing interest among fund managers and investors to have a means
of monitoring the performance of SES-listed shares with
substantial regional operations, the SES added.

<HEADLINE> Singapore's IT Industry to Sustain 30 Pc Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The information technology
(IT) industry of Singapore, which registered a 34.3 percent growth
to about 4.74 billion US dollars last year, is capable of
sustaining this growth in the next 15 months, the National
Computer Board (NCB) has projected.
</P>
<P>
In a statement published here today, the NCB said, "the
industry expects the high growth achieved in 1995 to continue into
1996 and 1997, with growth rates of more than 30 percent projected
for the overall IT industry."
</P>
<P>
Based on its Singapore IT Industry Survey 1996, the NCB found
that total turnover from sales of hardware, software and IT
services to end-users, excluding manufacturing output and sales to
original equipment manufacturers, increased from about 3.45
billion US dollars in 1994 to 4.74 billion US dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The increase came largely as a result of a strong export market
which expanded more than twice as fast as the domestic market, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Domestic sales posted a growth rate of 21.3 percent in 1995,
compared to 33.5 percent in 1994 due partly to the "cyclical
nature of the industry or the maturity of the domestic market," it
added.
</P>
<P>
However, the survey, which covered more than 340 IT companies,
also found that there is going to be a weakening of the export
market, but a substantial increase in domestic sales growth. Sales
in IT services are expected to expand fastest, followed by
software and hardware.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Might Take in Cows From Switzerland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, October 9 (Xinhua) -- A Hinduism religious group in
Nepal is likely to accept some 230,000 cows from Switzerland,
Nepal's official news agency RSS reported today.
</P>
<P>
An animal rights organization in Switzerland has offered to
send the cows to Nepal and provide financial assistance for their
breeding after the Swiss government earlier decided to destroy an
excess of 230,000 cows in three years, the report said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the World Hindu Federation Nepal
National Committee has replied that there would be no objection
to the transfer if the cows are healthy.
</P>
<P>
Nepal is a constitutional Hindu kingdom where cows are
respected as a holy animal. Any form of cow killing, even in a
traffic accident, could lead to imprisonment under Nepal's laws.
</P>
<P>
The RSS report said that a fax message to the news agency from
a Nepalese resident in Munich said that Germany suggested Nepal
not to take in these Swiss cows for the reason of the mad cow
disease panic recently arising in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Sino-U.S. Science Meeting to Open in Washington </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Sino-U.S. Joint
Commission on Science and Technology (JCST) will meet here on
October 25, to discuss ways of boosting the two countries'
cooperation in science and technology.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting is to sum up experience of cooperation between the
two countries in the past two years and discuss issues related to
the future cooperation, thus ensuring a smoother and better
cooperative relationship in science and technology," Yu Shuning,
press counselor of the Chinese Embassy here told a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be co-chaired by Song Jian, China's state
councilor and minister of the State Science and Technology
Commission, and John Gibbons, U.S. assistant to the President for
Science and Technology, Yu said.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-U.S. cooperation in science and technology is an
important element in the overall relationship between the two
countries, said Yu. He said the Sino-US Umbrella Agreement on
Cooperation in Science and Technology has been extended for
another five years, effective from April 30, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation in a few dozen fields has brought about
fruitful results and has been mutually beneficial, and has also
played an active role in the promotion of the overall relationship
between the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Some positive developments in the relations between China and
the United States have been seen in recent months, said the
Chinese counselor.
</P>
<P>
The planned exchange of high-level visits by the two sides is
being implemented step by step, he said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher will visit China in
November, Chinese Minister of Defense Chi Haotian will visit the
United States in December, and Chinese President Jiang Zemin and
U.S. President Bill Clinton will meet during the APEC meeting in
the Philippines in November.
</P>
<P>
"We believe these high-level exchanges of visits are
conducive to deepening the mutual understanding between our two
countries and contributing to the improvement of our relations,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Yu said, problems remain in the Sino-U.S. relations,
with the Taiwan issue being China's major concern.
</P>
<P>
"We do not object to non-official economic and cultural
relations between Taiwan and countries having diplomatic
relations with China, but we firmly oppose these countries
developing official relations with Taiwan in whatever form, and
their selling arms to Taiwan," he said.
</P>
<P>
As the U.S. government has made solemn commitments in the three
Sino-U.S. Joint Communiques concerning these issues, the
counselor said, China hopes that the U.S. government will honor
these commitments to remove this major obstacle in bilateral
relations.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese electronics giant,
Sony Corporation, today reappointed John Calley as the new
president and chief operating officer of its U.S. movie unit Sony
Pictures Entertainment (SPE).
</P>
<P>
Calley, who has been the president of the United Artists
Pictures, will replace Alan Levine who has been fired for the poor
performance of the company.
</P>
<P>
In a major move to reconstruct its movie business, Sony also
appointed Jeff Sagansky as the SPE co-president and Masayuki Nozoe
as the SPE vice-president.
</P>
<P>
Both men were the vice-presidents of the Sony Corp. of
America. Sagansky will be in charge of television programs while
Nozoe will lead the technical and strategic departments.
</P>
<P>
SPE's sluggish business forced Sony to write off a loss of 260
billion yen (2.3 billion U.S. dollars) in fiscal 1994, ending in
March 1995.

DHAKA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's retired chief justice
Shahabuddin Ahmed was sworn in this morning as the republic's 14th
president.
</P>
<P>
The swear-in ceremony at the presidential palace here was
administered by present chief justice A.T.M. Afzal.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, cabinet ministers, diplomats and
leaders of professional groups attended the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Ex-president Abdur Rahman Biswas, who just completed his 5-year
tenure of office on Tuesday, also attended the ceremony to hand
over the presidency to his successor.
</P>
<P>
Shahabuddin, about 70, was declared elected as the president
unopposed on July 23 since he was the only candidate nominated by
the ruling Awami League.
</P>
<P>
He was born from a renowned social worker and philanthropist
family in a village in Mymensingh district in the North. He took a
bachelor of arts (hons.) in economics in 1951 and master of arts
in international relations from the Dhaka University later.
</P>
<P>
In addition to his duties as judge of the Supreme Court, he
also held the post of chairman of the Bangladesh Red Cross Society
from August 1978 to April 1982. He was appointed as chief justice
of the Supreme Court in 1990 and retired from the post last year.
</P>
<P>
Believed by the people as a man of strict principle, the judge
was appointed vice-president and acting president during the
country's "1991 transition of power" from military rule to the
parliamentary system and won wide reputation as neutral and fair
caretaker president in conducting the parliamentary elections in
February 1991.

<HEADLINE> Lord to Show U.S. Support for South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States announced
Tuesday that Assistant Secretary of State Winston Lord will visit
South Korea to "demonstrate very close alliance" with the
northeast Asian country.
</P>
<P>
Lord will start his three-day visit on Thursday and will
"specifically be there to take stock ... of all the events that
have transpired over the last couple of weeks," said State
Department spokesman Nicholas Burns.
</P>
<P>
One of the events was a spy case, in which a South Korean
military attache conspired with a Korean American working at a U.S
naval intelligence office to steal U.S. secrets.
</P>
<P>
The attache was forced to leave Washington before being
expelled as persona non grata while the Korean American was
arrested.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. press said the case showed there was friction between
the United States and South Korea, because the latter knew little
about U.S. dealings with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK).
</P>
<P>
Burns admitted that the United States was "very disappointed"
about the spy case, but he said Washington would not let it
"overshadow the fundamental strategic importance of this alliance
relationship" to both countries.
</P>
<P>
He said Lord's visit to Seoul was to "maintain and uphold the
agreed framework, which was of vital strategic interest to both
South Korea and the United States."
</P>
<P>
Lord is expected to hold talks with South Korean officials on
several issues, including the DPRK's submarine, which the DPRK
said had stranded on South Korea's coast while undertaking a
routine mission last month, but which South Korea insisted was
near its coast for infiltration.
</P>
<P>
The United States held that the DPRK should be responsible for
the incident. "We stand by South Korea in making sure that South
Korea is secure and stable in the wake of that incident," Burns
said.
</P>
<P>
The visit by Lord also follows the DPRK's decision on Sunday to
charge a U.S. citizen with espionage.
</P>
<P>
The DPRK's news agency said Pyongyang had formally charged Evan
Carl Hunzike, a 26-year-old missionary who entered DPRK on August
24, with spying for South Korea's intelligence agency.
</P>
<P>
The United States has rejected the charges and demanded his
immediate release.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Party Declares War on Money Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
If UMNO members continue to allow votes in party elections to
be bought and sold like shares on the stock market, eventually
those elected to lead the UMNO would no longer be those with
integrity, but those who betray the struggles of the party, said
Anwar, who is also deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"We will be unable to clean ourselves of the moral decay and
misconduct if we were to resort to using money to induce the
delegates to vote for us," he said.
</P>
<P>
Anwar said society which tolerated and condoned corrupt
practices should be prepared to endure all kinds of tyranny
because it would not be able to secure justice and fairness if
these could be bargained for.
</P>
<P>
The UMNO is a leading party in the ruling National Front led by
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who, in his meeting with
delegates and UMNO divisional leaders yesterday, urged them to
reject corrupt candidates.
</P>
<P>
His message on the eve of the assembly was believed to have a
great influence on the voting trend.
</P>
<P>
Anwar also spoke of the principles of democracy and freedom,
which he said could be abused because there were people who could
use freedom not for good intentions but to create chaos.
</P>
<P>
"Hence we should adorn ourselves with praiseworthy attributes
of justice, wisdom, courage and benevolence," he said.
</P>
<P>
He reminded both the UMNO Youth and Women UMNO movements to
play their role side by side to ride out even greater obstacles
and disorder during the period of transition faced by young people
now and in the years to come.
</P>
<P>
The focus of the UMNO Youth and Women UMNO assemblies, being
attended by 517 UMNO youth delegates and 519 women delegates as
well as hundreds of observers from all parts of the country, is
the election of office-bearers including the top posts in both
movements.
</P>
<P>
A total of 72 candidates are contesting for posts in the UMNO
Youth movement and 38 in the Women UMNO movement, according to
party sources.

TOKYO, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Family members and friends of
well-known climber Masatsugu Konishi, feared to have died
September 30 while descending from the peak of Nepal's 8,163-meter
Mount Manaslu, left Tokyo today for Kathmandu, Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Konishi's wife, Ikuko, 50, and the couple's 24-year-old son
Nozomi and 23-year-old daughter Mayu were in the group. They were
accompanied by members of the Tohryo Alpine Club, to which Konishi
belonged.
</P>
<P>
Konishi's wife told reporters before boarding that she "cannot
be so optimistic" about her husband's fate on the mountain.
</P>
<P>
"I have to prepare myself for the worst since I have lost
others close to me under similar circumstances before," she said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the helicopter search for Konishi was
suspended Tuesday after consultation with remaining Japanese
members at the Manaslu base camp.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-seven-year-old Konishi, a businessman from Tokyo, was
last seen by climbing partners in an exhausted state on his
descent from Mt. Manaslu, the world's seventh highest peak.
</P>
<P>
Konishi became famous in Japan after scaling the Matterhorn via
the north face in the 1967 winter season and the Grandes Jorasses
via the north face in 1971.

<P>
YANGON, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar should increase its
agricultural production in order to export the surplus to earn
foreign exchange, Minister for Agriculture and Irrigation Myint
Aung said.
</P>
<P>
The minister told ministry officials at a meeting here Tuesday
that measures have been taken to expand farmland and water supply,
the official paper "the New Light of Myanmar" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The country's agricultural products are rice, beans and pulses,
cotton, sugarcane, rubber and jute.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed the need to change rice species for
boosting yield.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that arrangements have been made to enable
cultivation of three crops a year.
</P>
<P>
He called for attention to be paid to Ayeyawaddy, Bago, Yangon
and Sagaing divisions and Rakhine and Mon states in the country.
</P>
<P>
Favorable conditions exist in these places for achieving
self-sufficiency in rice for the nation and then for a surplus, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged that attention be paid to Mandalay and Magway
divisions and Shan and Kachin states which will play a supporting
role for the purpose.

<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar's rice output in the
1995-96 fiscal year was 950 million baskets (more than 19 million
tons) while its rice export was 1.5 million tons.

million U.S. dollars to repair and maintain the nation's roads,
especially the roads running into the South Common Market
(Mercosur) countries.

</P>
<P>
Highway 116 connects Sao Paulo in southern Brazil and Rio
Grande do Sul bordering on Uruguay, Brazil's main export
corridor to Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay, the other three
Mercosur countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Brazilian government will also build a road
linking Sao Paulo with Minas Gerais, where 18 motor vehicle
assembly factories would turn the area into the world's fifth
biggest auto production center.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso said that the road program will create 60,000 jobs in
the next two years and strengthen the competitive edge of
Brazilian products on the international market.

<P>
WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States will not
try to impose a solution on the Northern Ireland issue and is
interested only in helping the people there find "a just and
lasting peace of their own choosing," a senior adviser of U.S.
President Bill Clinton said here today.
</P>
<P>
The United States continues to be neutral on the issue,
Clinton's national security adviser Anthony Lake said in an
address to the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy at Georgetown
University.
</P>
<P>
Lake made the remarks just one day after car-bomb attacks at
British army headquarters in Northern Ireland which wounded 31
people.
</P>
<P>
The White House issued a statement after the Ireland Republican
Army claimed responsibility for the bombing, calling the attack
"barbaric" and demanding swift justice for the bombers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Lake praised the province's Protestant militias for
holding fire despite provocations, saying it is "inspiring" that
Protestants in Northern Ireland "who once shunned the political
process, now have proved so courageous and steady in pursuing
peace."
</P>
<P>
"If they can uphold a cease-fire and remain open to dialogue,
surely the Irish Republican Army can do no less," Lake said.
</P>
<P>
Lake said the United States urged "loyalists not to be provoked
into a futile and deadly spiral of violence in Northern Ireland."

<P>
NANJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province is
expecting to reap a record 34 billion kg of grain this year,
according to local officials.
</P>
<P>
The figure represents a rise of 500 million kg of grain over
the 1984 level, the highest standard in the history of the
province's grain production.
</P>
<P>
The officials said several factors contributed to the
outstanding harvest: the provincial authorities have strengthened
leadership over agriculture, farmers have been increasingly
enthusiastic about investing more money for agricultural
production in the wake of the central government's decision to
raise grain purchase prices, and the widespread application of
agro-techniques in farming has resulted in per-unit yield
increases.
</P>
<P>
The area sown with grain in the province has increased to 2.28
million hectares this year, according to the official.

<HEADLINE> Peru, Ecuador Seek Peaceful End To Border Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BARILOCHE, ARGENTINA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The border dispute
between Peru and Ecuador will be settled in a peaceful way, the
defense ministers of the two countries announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made by Peruvian Defense Minister Juan
Castillo Meza and his Ecuadorean counterpart Victor Bayas during
the Second Summit Meeting of the defense ministers of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
The long-standing border dispute between Peru and Ecuador over
the Cordillera del Condor, the access to the Amazon river basin,
has been a nightmare for both countries.
</P>
<P>
The latest confrontation occurred in early January 1995 when
troops were sent to the region by both sides. Each accused the
other of initiating air and mortar attacks and of territory
violations.
</P>
<P>
Though a cease-fire agreement was reached later, there were
recurrent reports of violations of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Bayas said: "As far as Ecuador is concerned, there is a
decision of the government to continue the dialogue with Peru
within a climate of peace."
</P>
<P>
He said the foreign ministers of both countries would meet in
Santiago, capital of Chile, on October 28 to continue
negotiations on the matter.
</P>
<P>
The Ecuadorean President Abdala Bucaram Ortiz would pay a
good-will visit to Lima in January 1997, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Peruvian minister underlined that regular meetings had
been held between high-ranking officials of the two countries'
armed forces and significant agreements had been reached.
</P>
<P>
He expressed optimism that the border dispute would be solved
peacefully through the efforts of both sides.

<HEADLINE> Massive Search for Suicide Bombers in Colombo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Colombo police, assisted by the
country's armed forces, launched a massive operation to search for
Tamil rebel suicide bombers in the capital and its suburbs Tuesday
evening, according to police sources here today.
</P>
<P>
The cordon and search operation began soon after intelligence
officers received reports that three Tamil rebel suicide bombers
had moved into a very high security zone in Kollupiya, Colombo,
according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
During the operation, police arrested 12 suspects including two
girls, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
They added that the suspects, who came from northern Jaffna and
eastern Batticaloa, are now in police custody and are being
interrogated.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, 13 suspects including three Tamil girls were taken
into police custody during another cordon and search operation
mounted by police in the city on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The sources pointed out that the Tamil rebels, who have been
fighting for a separate state in the country's north and east, are
planning to attack major towns in the south following their defeat
by the government troops since last December.
</P>
<P>
There are reliable reports that the rebels have targeted
certain vital installations in Colombo, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Police last Sunday asked all citizens in Colombo and its
suburbs to maintain maximum vigilance and help them track down 25
Black Tigers suicide squad rebels who had entered the city.

<HEADLINE> Thai Central Bank Sets Offshore Loans Growth Ceiling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Thailand has set a
19 percent ceiling this year for growth in offshore loans to the
local market through Bangkok International Banking Facilities
(BIBF), known as out-in loans.
</P>
<P>
The imposition of the ceiling is the latest in a series of
measures aimed at curbing the inflow of short-term funds,
according to central bank sources.
</P>
<P>
To reach the targeted ceiling, it will require very tight
controls for the rest of the year, since out-in lending in the
first eight months already exceeded the total for all of 1995 by
16 percent.
</P>
<P>
The central bank has stressed that out-in BIBF loans must be
for priority economic sectors, particularly export-oriented
businesses, and not for speculation and consumption.
</P>
<P>
The central bank last week raised the minimum amount for each
offshore loan from 2 million U.S. dollars to 5 million dollars,
effective on December 1.
</P>
<P>
The central bank believes that the measures will result in less
external debt and more baht lending. They could also increase
domestic savings, since financial institutions must take in more
deposits if they want to make more baht loans.

<P>
CARACAS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Mobil oil company and
Pequiven, a subsidiary of Petroleos de Venezuela, have announced
their intention to form a joint company to produce lubricants,
press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The proposed company will build a refinery complex in Jose, the
state of Anzoategui, with an investment of 1.5 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The new complex, which will turn out 830,000 tons of ethylene
and 280,000 tons of conventional low-density polyethylene per
year, will take advantage of the enormous supplies of ethane gas
in eastern Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
When the complex is completed in 1997, Venezuela will be able to
double its production capacity of olefins and by-products.
</P>
<P>
Industry experts said that the new complex will help to
stimulate the Venezuelan economy by providing more jobs and
acquiring Venezuelan engineering services, equipment and
materials.

<HEADLINE> Honduras Launches Farming Project in South </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Peasant groups in southern
Honduras and businessmen in the country started a million-dollar
project this week to make this region productive and
self-sufficient in grain supply.
</P>
<P>
Honduras, once a Central American bread basket, is now facing a
severe crisis in the supply of basic grains.
</P>
<P>
The project, which will benefit about 3,000 peasant families,
is designed to attract back to the south all those who have
migrated to other parts of the country, especially the north,
because of drought and lack of incentives.
</P>
<P>
"The perfect method would be for the peasants to provide the
land and for us, who have the other elements, to join them in a
unified effort," said Project Coordinator Calvin Weddle, president
of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in the south.
</P>
<P>
The project will be carried out in several stages, starting
with the establishment of 6,000 cantaloupe and watermelon
plantations in the first three years.
</P>
<P>
Then rice, maize, sorghum and beans will be grown, requiring an
investment of 1.5 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The government is urging all the state-owned agricultural
institutions in the country to cooperate with these peasant
groups.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Ask Supreme Court to Stop Creation of SPCPD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Critics of the Southern
Philippines Council for Peace and Development (SPCPD) led by nine
lawmakers from Mindanao has asked the Supreme Court to declare the
creation of the SPCPD "unconstitutional," the local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
They said on Tuesday that the executive order signed by
President Fidel Ramos last week to create the council and the zone
of peace and development, composed of 14 provinces and nine
cities, is illegal.
</P>
<P>
They also said Ramos had no "constitutional or statutory powers
to create the SPCPD" and accused him of "culpable violation" of
the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The petitioners said the SPCPD was not an offshoot of a peace
agreement signed in September between the government and the Moro
National Liberation Front (MNLF), but rather an implementation of
the 1976 Tripoli agreement between the MNLF and the Marcos
administration.
</P>
<P>
"But the (Ramos) government cannot implement the Tripoli
agreement because it is null and void for not being ratified by
Congress," they said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, they said, the establishment of the SPCPD violated the
law of the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) and
undermined "the sovereign will" of the people in Mindanao who had
rejected in a plebiscite a proposal to include their cities and
provinces in the ARMM governed by MNLF Chairman Nur Misuari.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Aims to Become Major Gold Producer Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's gold mining industry
still retains its luster although it has lost the leading position
it once enjoyed in the world gold production.
</P>
<P>
Its proven gold reserves are now estimated at 2,059 tons, worth
about 26 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Information provided by a Brazilian exploration company
indicates that the country's annual gold production should reach
102 tons by the year 2000, nearly doubling the 1995 output of 66
tons.
</P>
<P>
Official estimates say that Brazil's gold production this year
will reach 72 tons, ranking the country seventh in the world.
</P>
<P>
In order to become a major world gold producer again, the
Brazilian government plans to attract two billion dollars in
foreign investment to boost gold exploration and extraction.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's gold mines stretch along a belt of nearly one million
square kilometers, covering 12 percent of the country's total land
mass. The Amazon region will become a major gold mining base in
the coming 10 years.
</P>
<P>
In this drive, the Vale DO Rio Doce Company (CVRD), the largest
gold producer in Latin America, has an important role to perform.
It produces 18 tons a year, or 40 percent of Brazil's total gold
production.
</P>
<P>
The CVRD presently operates six gold mines stretching from the
north to the southeast of the country. The biggest one, the
Igarape Bahia, is an opencut mine located in the northern state of
Para and is presently producing 10 tons a year.
</P>
<P>
The company, which has a combined gold deposit of 560 tons, is
intensifying exploration efforts and hoping to enter the next
century with an annual output of 31 tons.

<HEADLINE> China Raps Listed Company for Unlawful Information Disclosure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The watchdog China Securities
Regulatory Commission (CSRC) warned and fined a listed company for
disclosing false information which was designed to mislead
investors.
</P>
<P>
A notice issued today by the CSRC said the Bohai Group
Co. Ltd.'s 1996 interim report was "seriously false" and violated
the state accounting regulations by counting in the assets value
of two investments it has not made into its common accumulation
fund.
</P>
<P>
The company was also accused of unlawfully publicizing
information on land assessment for an entertainment center in
which it had planned to invest.
</P>
<P>
The notice said the Bohai company has gravely misled its
investors in a report carried in Shanghai Securities News on July
12, which said its assets increased by 141,357,700 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The increased assets came from an unapproved investment project,
and are not permitted to be figured into the company's assets.
</P>
<P>
According to the CSRC notice, Bohai was given a warning and
fined 500,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The company was also ordered to correct the false information
in its interim report and publicize the adjusted information in
"China Securities News" and "Shanghai Securities News" within 30
days after it received the CSRC notice.
</P>
<P>
Trading in the Bohai company's shares which has been suspended
for 50 days will resume on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The CSRC also declared in the notice it would continue
investigating into the irregularities of the company and other
institutions involved, in order to standardize the fledgling
securities market.

<HEADLINE> Emphasis on Culture Necessary in Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The municipal government should
enhance its cultural base as its economic development accelerates,
members of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) said at a recent
meeting, according to today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The meeting followed a four-month survey of the city's cultural
establishments.
</P>
<P>
Alarmed with the results, members suggested the local
government quickly establish a committee to propel the city's
cultural development and launch a cultural awareness campaign.
</P>
<P>
They complained that the city lacked adequate theaters, public
libraries and museums, but was overwhelmed with shopping centers
and skyscrapers.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the State Council approved a comprehensive
construction plan that acknowledges Beijing's historic treasures
as well as its importance as a modern international
metropolis. Under the plan, Beijing should become the country's
political and cultural center.
</P>
<P>
While it may be the political base, the survey shows that
Beijing isn't yet a cultural hub. In fact, many citizens amuse
themselves by watching television or playing mahjong, as the
city's theaters, bookstores and libraries decreased year after
year.
</P>
<P>
Several old, downtown theaters were displaced by commercial
projects in recent years, leaving 16 theaters for 10 million
people.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Capital Museum is stockpiling 3,400 years of
historic relics from a Confucian temple but has lacked
preservation materials and equipment since it opened in 1981.
</P>
<P>
In 1949, Beijing had 307 bookstores. Now it has 140.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. presidential debate
between incumbent President Bill Clinton and Republican challenger
Bob Dole on Sunday drew a third fewer TV viewers than a 1992
three-way debate including Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Dole fought a heated yet close verbal battle in the
90-minute face-off at Hartford of Connecticut, but compared with a
1992 debate, they are both losers in drawing more television
viewers.
</P>
<P>
according to Nielsen Media Research figures released Tuesday,
the Clinton-Dole contest captured a total rating of 29.3 on ABC,
CBS, NBC and CNN. That translates into 28.4 million households.
</P>
<P>
That figure can be most easily compared with 1992's second
Bush-Clinton-Perot debate which drew total ratings of 46.3 for
ABC, CBS, NBC and CNN, translating to a total of 43.1 million
households. Perot, then an independent candidate, is a Texas
billionaire.
</P>
<P>
Jeff Zucker, NBC's executive producer of political coverage,
said, "The audience was pretty much consistent with the amount of
voter interest all year. It's what we expected it to be."
</P>
<P>
Vice presidential candidates Al Gore and Jack Kemp are
scheduled to debate Wednesday night, and Clinton and Dole will
have a second and final debate on October 16.

BANGKOK, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Computers and parts were one of
Thailand's few sectors which registered an export surge in the
first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's export of computers, accessories and parts rose by 45
percent during the first six months this year, compared with the
same period last year, according to Business Economics Department
figures.
</P>
<P>
Export of these commodities reached 85.28 billion baht (3.43
billion U.S. dollars), accounting for 12 percent of the country's
total half-year export value.
</P>
<P>
While exports went up in the first half, imports in the sector
also increased by 12 percent to 35.3 billion baht (1.4 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The sector became the country's leading exporter in 1994 when
its export value exceeded that of garments.
</P>
<P>
Growth of Thailand's overall exports this year is expected to
be no more than 10 percent although the government last year
projected an 18-percent increase.

<HEADLINE> Women Judges Play Greater Role in Judicial System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Women judges have broken through
the traditional barriers to become an active force in China's
judicial system, playing an increasingly important role in
developing the system and protecting people's legitimate rights.
</P>
<P>
"They have won respect and trust from the people through
arduous and excellent work," Wen Huifang, secretary-general of the
China Women Judges Association (CWJA), was quoted by today's China
Daily as saying.
</P>
<P>
The improvement in the quality and quantity of women judges
reflects the advancement of Chinese women's status, Wen said.
</P>
<P>
China now has some 23,000 women judges, representing 15 percent
of the total of 156,000 judges.
</P>
<P>
Wen said that women judges often deal better with cases
involving women, marriage or family affairs, since they
understand much more about both women's and men's needs,
difficulties and feelings.
</P>
<P>
In order to better unite women judges at all levels and improve
their professional quality and status, the CWJA was set up in 1994
as constituent group of the All-China Women's Federation.
</P>
<P>
The CWJA has strived to provide favorable conditions for women
judges to handle cases, exchange views, voice opinions and study
the law.
</P>
<P>
Wen said that women judges, though still small in numbers, have
dedicated themselves to popularization of legal knowledge,
protection of people's legitimate rights, especially women's.

<HEADLINE> Croatia Nips Bosnia-Herzegovina in World Cup Qualifier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Striker Alen Boksic hit two
second-half goals, leading Croatia for a 4-1 away victory over
Bosnia-Herzegovina in the World Cup group one qualifying match in
Bologna on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
The favored Croat team led 2-1 at halftime on goals from Slaven
Bilic in the 11th and Goran Vlaovic in the 31st.
</P>
<P>
Forward Salihamidzic scored Bosnia-Herzegovina only goal in the
22nd minute.
</P>
<P>
Boksic struck twice in the 62nd and in the 85th as the Bosnian
team left its defense unprotected in its bid for a second goal.
</P>
<P>
As the talented Croat team made a successful debut in World Cup
qualifying, Bosnia-Herzegovina suffered its second defeat in as
many qualifying games.
</P>
<P>
It lost 0-3 to Greece at Kalamata last month.
</P>
<P>
Greece is the current leader of Group One, which also includes
Denmark and Slovenia.
</P>
<P>
In the other game of Tuesday, Bulgaria, reduced to 10 men
after an hour when substitute Ivan Vassilev got his marching
order, squeezed out a 2-1 win over Luxembourg to breathe fresh air
into its World Cup qualifying campaign.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria, badly in need of a win after losing its opening
European Group Five qualifier to Israel last month, took the lead
in the 14th minute when Krasimir Balakov converted a penalty after
Emil Kostadinov was fouled.
</P>
<P>
Roby Langers equalised six minutes later with a low 10-meter
shot.
</P>
<P>
But Kostadinov re-established Bulgaria's advantage with a
clever lob from Yordan Lechkov's pass after 37 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Luxembourg took command after Vassilev was dismissed for
flooring Guy Hellers just outside the area, but Bulgarian
goalkeeper Borislav Mihailov denied them goals with superb saves.

<HEADLINE> Mexican Researchers Find New Way of Birth Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Mexican researchers have
found a more effective way of birth control using just three pills
instead of the traditional dosage of 25 over the menstrual cycle.
</P>
<P>
The Mexican Social Security Institute (IMSS) said today that
taking three birth control pills in the first 72 hours of the
menstrual period was more effective in preventing pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
This was because the first three menstrual days were the key to
modifying the human hormone cycle that regulated fertility.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough comes after 25 years of research.
</P>
<P>
The three pills, one for each day, will be made up of estrogen,
a hormone similar to that produced by a woman's ovaries but in
much smaller quantity.
</P>
<P>
Vicente Cortes Gallegos, a researcher in the
gynaecology-obstetrics hospital run by the IMSS, explained that
the finding was based on observation of the critical phase of
ovulation.
</P>
<P>
He said that by taking the pills at the beginning of the
menstrual cycle, the hormone which regulated fertility could be
altered without having to take more pills thereafter.
</P>
<P>
Gallegos said that the dosage of birth control pills would
decrease by 90 percent thanks to the new contraceptive method,
while birth control costs would drop by more than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The new method is now under test for three years to prove its
efficiency and safety.

<HEADLINE> Alatas Denies ASEAN Delaying Myanmar's Entry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali
Alatas Tuesday categorically denied allegations that ASEAN member
countries were delaying Myanmar's entry into the regional
grouping.
</P>
<P>
"Principally, the ASEAN has no problem with Myanmar's
application for membership. It is only a matter of procedure and
timing," the minister said after attending an international
seminar last night.
</P>
<P>
The process of Myanmar's entry into the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) would be a continuing topic of
discussion at ASEAN senior officials' and ministerial meetings, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"So it is not true that the ministers of ASEAN member countries
have decided to delay Myanmar's entry into the ASEAN," the Antara
News Agency today quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Alatas admitted that certain ASEAN member countries wanted
Myanmar's entry into the regional grouping to be conditional on
its internal political conduct.
</P>
<P>
However, Indonesia strongly supported Myanmar's bid for
membership without questioning the way its government was handling
its internal political problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Bomb Suspect Could Be Cleared Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Olympic bomb suspect Richard
Jewell may be cleared if federal investigators are satisfied with
his answers to a weekend interrogation, one of his attorneys said
in Atlanta on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Lin Wood, a civil lawyer with the former security guard's
four-member legal team, said the federal investigators have
dropped their surveillance of Jewell and have agreed to clear him
of suspicion if his answers satisfy them.
</P>
<P>
The lawyer also said the FBI on Tuesday returned the last of
the property confiscated during a search of his suburban Atlanta
apartment, namely several rifles and handguns.
</P>
<P>
Jewell, 33, so far the only named suspect in the
investigation, spent nearly six hours on Sunday answering
questions from the FBI about his behaviour during the July 27
pipebomb attack, which left two people dead and more than 100
injured at Centennial Olympic Park in downtown Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
His lawyer said the interview was part of a deal with
U.S. Attorney Kent Alexander that could soon lead to Jewell's
exoneration.
</P>
<P>
G. Watson Bryant, Jewell's lead attorney, later said federal
officials have promised to reach a decision on Jewell within three
weeks.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Atlanta declined
to comment on the case.
</P>
<P>
On the night of the explosion, Jewell worked as a security
guard at a nearby Olympic pavillion operated by AT&AMP;T Corp for the
Atlanta Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
At first, he was hailed as a hero for finding the green
knapsack that carried the crude pipebomb. But he was named as a
suspect a few days later and has since been forced into seclusion.
</P>
<P>
The FBI seached the apartment he shares with mother and
confiscated property there.
</P>
<P>
Jewell, who steadily maintains his innocence, has said through
his attorneys that FBI leaks to the news media about his role as a
suspect have ruined his chances of finding gainful employment.
</P>
<P>
Until last week, FBI agents kept him under round-the-clock
surveillance. Then overt surveillance was replaced by what his
attorneys described as covert surveillance.

<HEADLINE> Construction of Large Department Stores to be Curbed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 9 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Internal Trade
issued a circular recently demanding the curbing of the
construction of large department stores.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the circular came amid excessive development
of large and luxurious department stores in some cities, which has
resulted in low economic returns for the developers and
inconvenience to consumers.
</P>
<P>
Because of poor planning, some of the construction is
repetitive, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The circular called on local governments to improve the
macro-management and planning of the construction.
</P>
<P>
It also demanded the readjustment of scheduled projects which
have proved to go beyond practical needs, and called for the
building of more convenience stores in residential areas.

</P>
<P>
Under the convention, all the money made through crimes,

Any country which has approved the convention is required to
fulfil the provisions of the convention when carrying out its
related laws and cooperate with other signatory countries.
</P>
<P>
The convention said that even if the black money has been
transferred to a certain signatory country, laundered and
deposited in a bank, the country should withhold the money for
confiscation, instead of resorting to the bank's security law to
protect it.
</P>
<P>
So far, nine European countries have approved the convention
including Switzerland, Britain and Italy, and another 15 countries
have signed it, including Germany, Luxembourg and Spain.

<HEADLINE> Alatas: WTO Risks Becoming "Adulterated" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, October 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior Indonesian official has
warned that the World Trade Organization (WTO) is in danger of
being "adulterated" as certain countries have shown a tendency to
resort to a new form of protectionism.
</P>
<P>
This form of protectionism is "in the guise of linking labor
and environmental concerns to issues of trade," Foreign Minister
Ali Alatas told a seminar on economic cooperation between
Indonesia and Latin America here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"This we cannot accept, for such a linkage would not only
threaten to negate the comparative advantage of developing
countries, but would also pose the risk of unraveling the hard-won
balance of rights, obligations and interests of the parties to the
Uruguay Round and the WTO Final Act."
</P>
<P>
Established two years ago as the embodiment of the commitments
and obligations of parties to the Uruguay Round and as the legal
and institutional foundation of the multilateral trading system,
the WTO is to hold its first ministerial meeting in Singapore in
the coming December.
</P>
<P>
"But up to this day, that multilateral trading system is not a
reality," Alatas pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The agenda has become the subject of dispute between developed
and developing nations, with the richer countries wanting social
issues such as child labor and the environment to be considered
when setting international trade policy.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries however fear that a new form of
protectionism may emerge if they are forced to follow strict
standards that would erase the comparative advantage they now
enjoy from cheaper labor and other costs.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia and many Southeast Asian nations have been waging a
diplomatic campaign to restrict the WTO meeting to solely trade
issues.
</P>
<P>
Alatas called on developing countries to take a common stand
and prevent a weakening of the WTO at this "fragile stage of its
infancy."
</P>
<P>
"It is therefore imperative that developing countries
strengthen their solidarity in international fora and intensify
their cooperation for social and economic development within the
framework of South-South cooperation," the minister said.

OTTAWA, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd
Axworthy today condemned Monday's double bombing at the British
Army Headquarters in Lisburn, Northern Ireland.
</P>

reinstate its truce, which would enable Sinn Fein to participate in
the Multi-Party talks and contribute to the climate necessary for the
peace process to succeed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Democratic and non-violent means should be used to achieve peace
and reconciliation, he said, adding that talks represent the best
opportunity to advance the peace process and to establish a just and
enduring peace.
</P>
<P>
"We urge that the negotiations continue, and not be undermined by
the bombing," he noted.

efforts of the British and Irish governments to find a just and
lasting peace in Northern Ireland.

<HEADLINE> British Tory Opens Its Conference amid Heated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bournemouth, England, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Tory
opened its last annual conference before election here today with
the aim to win a fifth successive term in government.
</P>
<P>
Under the slogan "Opportunity For All", Party chairman Brian
Mawhinney told delegates: "This is a party that is on its way to
winning the next election." "We must win and we will win," he
declared.
</P>
<P>
But what happened before the gathering could hardly cheer the
delegates. With the party's sharp split over European affairs, the
new allegations of political sleazy involving Tory MPs, and the
defection of ex-deputy chairman Lord McAlpine to Referendum Party,
it is hard for the party leadership to boost their confidence.
</P>
<P>
To make matters even worse, a terrorist attack yesterday on
British Army's Headquarters in Northern Ireland appeared to be
timed to coincide with the opening of the Tory conference, which
undoubtedly shadowed the significance of the crucial conference.
</P>
<P>
On the question of the European Monetary System, Prime Minister
John Major has adopted a wait-and-see policy towards it, saying he
will decide after the next election if it is in Britain's interest
to join.
</P>
<P>
He said it would be "silly" to have rows over Europe at the
conference. "There's no point in pushing. We are in the
negotiations and we are staying in the negotiations, and I just
hope colleagues will accept that," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, David Heathcoat-Amory, former Paymaster-General who
resigned earlier this year over the European single currency, told
a fringe meeting today "Let us rule out now British participation
in a single European currency."
</P>
<P>
"The proposal to give up the pound is a constitutional outrage
and would be an economic disaster...We are sleepwalking towards a
general election unable to make up our minds about an issue that
will have to be decided next year," he argued.
</P>
<P>
John Redwood, former Welsh Secretary, who challenged Major for
the leadership, also told the Prime Minister that he could unite
the Tories by ruling out joining a single currency.
</P>
<P>
He argued that most party members want Major to take a more
Eurosceptic stance and that such a position would improve their
election chances.
</P>
<P>
"Far from being a difficult issue. Europe is one of our best
issues," he said. "We are ahead of Labor in the polls on Europe.
The mood of delegates shows that we are united on Europe. We are
just waiting for the right lead," he added.
</P>
<P>
Leon Brittan, a former Tory cabinet minister, hit back at the
European doubters. "If those hostile to the European Union wish to
pursue the debate with integrity, it is time for them to declare
their hand," said Brittan, now European Commission vice-president.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe that the heated argument on Europe at
the opening day of the conference proves that it is hard for Tory
to show their unity at the annual conference.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Exports in 1996 to Reach 2.5 Billion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, October 8 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia's exports are
expected to reach 2.5 billion U.S. dollars this year, Director of
the Yugoslav Statistics Institute Milovan Zivkovic said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Predicting on the basis of the latest figures on foreign trade
for the past nine months of 1996, Zivkovic said September
witnessed a 32 percent increase in exports against the same month
of last year, which has brought the value of Yugoslav exports for
the first nine months of 1996 to 1.259 billion dollars, or 9.5
percent more than in the corresponding period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Imports at the same period reached 2.655 billion U.S. dollars,
which is 42 percent more than the same period of 1995, he added.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that imports decrease each month, and that
Yugoslav importers purchase mainly raw materials and other inputs
needed to reactivate production.
</P>
<P>
Now that the international sanctions against Yugoslavia have
been lifted, Yugoslav exports are expected to grow considerably by
the end of the year, Tanjug news agency quoted Zivkovic as saying.
</P>
<P>
During the 52-month-long overall trade embargo which ended
early this month, Yugoslavia's economy had got a deadly blow, with
the direct economic loss stood at 50 billion U.S. dollars, and per
capita in the country dropped by half, according to official
estimates.
</P>
<P>
Zivkovic also expects a considerable growth of exports in the
beginning of 1997, when regular international payments operations
are resumed and Yugoslavia is reintegrated in all international
organizations and institutions.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 8 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
said Tuesday that the IRA's attack on the County Antrim army base
Monday has ruled its political wing Sinn Fein out of Ulster's
multi-party peace talks, according to a BBC TV report today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference at the annual conference of the
Conservative Party, Major said that the IRA's actions were
"incompatible with democratic negotiations".
</P>
<P>
The admission by the IRA earlier today that it planted the
devices was "sickening", he added.
</P>
<P>
Major also said that it was important that the protestants
should not retaliate.
</P>
<P>
The Ulster Democratic Party, linked to loyalist paramilitaries,
called on everyone to avoid a return to full-scale violence.

<HEADLINE> UN Urges Angola to Accelerate Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 8 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali urged all parties in Angola to accelerate
peace process, according to a report available here today.
</P>
<P>
His report on the United Nations Angola Verification Mission
(UNAVEM III) noted that the lack of significant progress in the
peace process over the past three months caused severe concern.
</P>
<P>
Though nearly two years have passed since the signing of the
Lusaka Protocol, the Angolan government and the National Union for
the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), particularly on the part
of UNITA, had continued delays and fulfilled promises in
implementing the successive timetables for the completion of key
military and political issues, the report said.
</P>
<P>
On quartering of UNITA troops, the report said the number of
UNITA personnel registered in the 15 quartering areas stood at
63,189, which exceeded the figure of 62,500 initially declared by
UNITA. But, the desertions, reaching 11,500 now, were worrisome.
</P>
<P>
The overall quality of weapons and ammunition surrendered by
UNITA remained low: only 28,672 personal weapons and 3,969
crew-served weapons had been surrendered to the U.N. while a total
of 24,867 troops had registered in the quartering areas without
weapons, the report added.
</P>
<P>
On relief and rehabilitation, the report said that over 1.2
million displaced persons depended on food aid for another 12
months and approximately 100,000 ex-combatants should be
demobilized and reintegrated into society.
</P>
<P>
The report urged the international community to assist the
rehabilitation of rural communities, which would help absorb the
large number of refugees, displaced persons and former combatants.
</P>
<P>
On the mandate of UNAVEM III, the largest U.N. peacekeeping
operation now, the secretary-general said that it was difficult to
acquire international support for operations which did not enjoy
the full cooperation of the conflicting parties.
</P>
<P>
He intended to initiate the downsizing of UNAVEM III by
withdrawing some infantry and support units by the end of
December. He believes that UNAVEM III could fulfill most of its
tasks before expiration of its mandate on February 8, 1997.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the international response to Angola's
continuing need for support would depend on the concrete actions
of the Angolan parties in the coming weeks.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, October 8 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial
average made another short-lived move above 6,000 today, backing
away as stocks edged lower in nervous trading before the quarterly
flood of earnings reports.
</P>
<P>
The Dow lost 13.04 to 5,966.77, having retreated from an early
30 point gain that lifted the blue-chip gauge to about 6,010.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 4-to-3 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume totaled 434.66 million shares, up from 380.76
million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index and other major indexes
fell after making their record gains on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The long-term interest rate was sent slightly higher on the
bond market. And some less optimistic earnings reports made
investors doubt about company gains in the last quarter.
</P>
<P>
Investors were awaiting Friday's data on wholesale price levels
in September, hoping for further confirmation of the recently
upbeat inflation and interest rate outlook.
</P>
<P>
Stocks surged Friday after the government reported that
unemployment unexpectedly edged higher in September from a
seven-year low in August.
