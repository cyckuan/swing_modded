<HEADLINE> Big Fire Destroys Seven Oil Tanks in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 11 (Xinhua) -- A big fire which broke out in
Assam State of eastern India on Tuesday, destroyed seven oil tanks
of the Indian Oil Corporation, official sources said here Tuesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
Ten fire tenders are still fighting to extinguish the blaze,
with its spread now under control.
</P>
<P>
The fire was first spotted by a security guard Tuesday morning
in an oil tank which was followed by a loud explosion. The blaze
soon engulfed the other tanks -- three containing kerosene oil and
two each of gasoline and diesel.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the fire is yet to be known. One senior police
officer, who visited the site, has ruled out involvement of
militants as reported earlier. He said the fire could have been
caused by an electric short circuit. Some sources, however, have
asserted that it could be a case of internal sabotage.
</P>
<P>
The explosion was followed by black rain containing carbon and
other solid particles. It is being investigated to ascertain its
links with the tank fire, the same sources said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Bankruptcy Applications Continue at Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Increased Americans applied
for federal bankruptcy protection in the 12 months that ended on
June 30, more than any one-year period in history, the
Administrative Office of the U.S. courts reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Federal bankruptcy filings climbed to a record high 1.42
million for those 12 months, due largely to a 9.2 percent increase
in personal bankruptcies, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
It also showed that the number of business bankruptcies dropped
from the 53,993 filed in the 12-month period ending in June 1997
to 50,202. But nonbusiness or personal bankruptcies were up from
1.26 million to 1.37 million.
</P>
<P>
In February, the office reported that 1.4 million bankruptcy
petitions were filed in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The most common form of bankruptcy proceeding is filed under
the federal code's Chapter 7, designed to allow individuals to
keep certain belongings while selling off other property to repay
creditors. Businesses that file under Chapter 7 sell off all
assets and are being forced to cease doing business.
</P>
<P>
For the 12 months ending last June 30, 1.01 million Chapter 7
petitions were filed.
</P>
<P>
More than 400,000 petitions were filed under the code's Chapter
13, which allows debtors to repay creditors in installments, in
full or in part, over a period of years.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Chief Executive to Take Measures to Help SMEs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, said here Tuesday
that he has devoted most of his time recently to the formulation
of measures to create an environment conducive to small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).
</P>
<P>
Meeting with representatives of the Chinese Manufacturers'
Association of Hong Kong, Tung exchanged views with them on ways
to provide facilitation for the SMEs in developing high
value-added activities which would create a substantial employment
base for the local work force in the future. They also discussed
short- and long-term measures to assist the SMEs.
</P>
<P>
Tung said a 2.5 billion HK dollar (320.5 million U.S. dollars)
loan facility for the SMEs is an emergency measure to ease the
credit squeeze brought about by the Asian financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
He noted with pleasure that an authorized institution in the
banking sector has just signed up to participate in the scheme.
</P>
<P>
The government would review the scheme upon implementation with
a view to making it more user-friendly to both the authorized
institution and the SMEs, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tung noted that the SMEs are facing several major challenges in
their long-term development. He listed the challenges as including
the need to enhance productivity through new technology, the need
for greater access to more timely market information and improved
use of such information through new technology and better trained
employees and the need to improve cost effectiveness.

<HEADLINE> India Develops Longer Range Version of Missile Agni </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 11 (Xinhua) -- India has started developing a
longer range version of intermediate range ballistic missile Agni,
Defense Minister George Fernandes said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In a briefing to the consultative committee of members of the
parliament attached to the Defense Ministry, Fernandes said the
government's recent approval of the second phase of missile Agni
followed the successful completion of the first phase
demonstrating re-entry technology.
</P>
<P>
India has so far flight-tested thrice the Agni missile with a
range of 1,500 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The new version of the missile would have a strike range much
longer than its present 1,500 kilometers. The new range is
expected to reach 2,500 kilometers or more.
</P>
<P>
The Agni missile is part of India's integrated guided missile
program spearheaded by the Defense Research and Development
Organization in the 1980s, which also included surface-to-surface
missile Prithvi, surface-to-air missile Trishul, surface-to-air
missile Akash and anti-tank missile Nag.
</P>
<P>
The defense minister told the committee that efforts are on to
ensure that the sanctions imposed by the United States following
the country's five nuclear tests in mid-May this year will have no
adverse effects on the missile program which is in a very advanced
stage of development.

<TEXT>
<P>
JINGZHOU, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier and Head of the
State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters Wen Jiabao has
urged provinces along the Yangtze River to make strenuous efforts
to protect the Yangtze embankments and win an overall victory over
the floods, the worst since 1931.
</P>
<P>
The essence of the central leadership's instruction is to
ensure the safety of the Yangtze embankments and the lives of the
people, he said.
</P>
<P>
The national anti-flood chief made this remark Tuesday while
presiding over a meeting in Jingzhou City in central China's
Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
He also urged that the flood victims be taken care of and
provided with food, drinking water and housing as well as
security. Criminal activities of various kinds must be dealt with
to maintain social stability in the flooded areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
In related developments, water levels on the Yangtze, as well
as in Dongting and Poyang lakes, have been receding gradually as the
year's fourth flood crest passes down the Yangtze.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a major flood has begun to devastate the country's
northeastern areas including Heilongjiang Province and the Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region, prompting the State Flood Control and
Drought Relief Headquarters to issue an emergency call to
reinforce the battle against the floods in that part of the
country.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Dismantles Islamists' Network Before Attack: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- A French expert on international
terrorism said Tuesday that Kenya dismantled an Islamists' network
in the region of Mombasa two or three months ago.
</P>
<P>
Professor Xavier Raufer said in an interview with France 2
television channel that France was following that operation by the
Kenyan security force because the terrorists could launch attacks
on French installations in neighboring Djibouti.
</P>
<P>
He regretted that the Islamists, who he said followed the
movement led by Saudi billionaire Oussama Ben Laden, finally
succeeded in making the double bombing attack on U.S. embassies in
Nairobi and Dar es Salaam last week.
</P>
<P>
"There was a space of vague threat which turned around in the
region and which ended by concretizing itself,"said Raufer, who
is a professor of the Institute of Criminology of Paris.
</P>
<P>
He said that the terrorists used Semtex, an extremely powerful
explosive, in attacking the U.S. embassy in Nairobi.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Productivity Dips in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua)-- The U.S. workers' productivity
declined during the second quarter of the year for the first time
in more than three years, the Labor Department reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Productivity of nonfarm, nonsupervisory workers, output per
hour of work, dropped at a 0.2 percent annual rate, according to
the department.
</P>
<P>
The second-quarter productivity decrease was the first since a
drop at a 0.4 percent rate during the first three months of 1995.
However, it followed an increase at a 3.5 percent rate in the
first quarter, the strongest in two years.
</P>
<P>
The decline is attributed to the fact that most employers kept
their payrolls at full strength despite a sharp slowing in
economic output caused by the falling export to Asia, the General
Motors strike and the need to sell goods that had piled up in
inventory.
</P>
<P>
However, with labor scarce, particularly for skilled jobs,
employers have been reluctant to order layoffs for fear they'd
have trouble getting workers back when they needed them.
</P>
<P>
As a result, unit labor costs, a key measure of inflation
pressure, increased at a 4.1 percent rate in the second quarter,
the highest in four years, after growing at a modest 1.1 percent
rate in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Productivity, after growing at a brisk 2.9 percent annual rate
in the 1960s and early 1970s, slowed to only a 1 percent from 1974
through 1995. It climbed to a 2.4 percent rate in 1996 and
maintained a 1.4 percent rate through 1995.

<HEADLINE> World Oil Prices Dive to 10-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The world's sluggish oil markets
Tuesday slumped to 10-year lows with global benchmark Brent crude
oil sinking to 11.55 U.S. dollars on the London futures market.
</P>
<P>
Although prices later recovered some ground to 11.76 dollars a
barrel around 1500 GMT, oil has already lost a dollar a barrel in
two days as concern grows about the size of a mountainous glut of
crude and petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that the price slide is expected to pressure
share prices of major oil companies and deliver a severe blow to
non-OPEC Russia.
</P>
<P>
They say Russian producers must now cut output and close wells
producing at a loss or undertake serious cost-cutting to weather
the current world oil price crisis.
</P>
<P>
London brokers GNI said that neither renewed confrontation
between the United Nations and Iraq nor bombings of U.S. embassies
in Africa were likely to support the sickly oil market.
</P>
<P>
"The reality is that neither of these two issues is likely to
seriously interrupt the world supply of oil in the near term," the
GNI Energy Report was quoted by Reuters as saying.
</P>
<P>
GNI and other analysts say relief for prices could come only
from strict compliance with OPEC output cuts and a very cold
northern hemisphere winter which would hike heating oil demand.

<HEADLINE> Mongolian President Urges Prime Minister Appointment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Mongolian President Nachagyn
Bagabandy has called on the Great Hural, Mongolia's parliament, to
appoint a new prime minister, in face of a difficult situation.
</P>
<P>
The appeal came in a letter sent to Radnaasumberel Gonchigdory,
the chairman of the Great Hural Bagabandy, on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Great Hural dismissed Prime Minister Tsakhya Elbegdorj's
government last month.
</P>
<P>
This government's decision in May to merge the state-owned
Renovation Bank with the private Golomt Bank not only, it was
claimed, violated the country's constitution and laws but also
brought a threat to the national economic security and financial
policies.
</P>
<P>
The shortage of oil products and soaring oil prices led to a
continuing fall in Mongolia's currency, worsening the economic
situation and dampening the confidence of foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
According to law, the Great Hural should appoint a new prime
minister within 30 days of the cabinet dismissal.
</P>
<P>
But until now, the parliamentary group formed by the Social
Democratic Party and the National Democratic party had not
discussed the problem with him, the president said.
</P>
<P>
The Mongolian Democratic Party Committee last month nominated
Davaadorj Ganbold, vice-president of the party, as the candidate
of new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The nomination was approved by the Social Democratic party on
August 6.
</P>
<P>
Under Mongolia's laws, the ruling party's parliamentary group
should discuss the nominees for prime minister with the president,
and the president then submits the nomination to the Great Hural
for approval.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 11 (Xinhua) -- German Defense Minister Volker
Ruehe said Tuesday that military plannings by the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO) for a possible intervention in Kosovo
are concentrating more on an air force operation in the Serbian
province.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with the German ZDF television
network, Ruehe said that NATO ground forces could only be involved
if a peace accord had been reached in Kosovo and if all
conflicting parties had asked for such a deployment.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that legal conditions must also be created
even for an air operation.
</P>
<P>
According to German media reports, ambassadors of NATO
countries are due to meet in Brussels Wednesday to approve the
first plans for a possible NATO military operation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Options raised by NATO members so far ranged from air strikes
on Serbian military targets, separating Kosovo conflicting parties
through NATO forces, to a large-scale deployment of over 50,000
NATO ground troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
However, any such operations must need a U.N. mandate, NATO
officials said.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, German government sources said
Tuesday that Bonn would agree to deploy up to 14 Tornado fighter
jets of the German air force for a possible NATO air operation in
Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> BP Purchases Amoco for 48 Bln Dlrs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The British Petroleum PLC
announced Tuesday that it would buy the Amoco Corp., the
fifth-largest U.S. oil company, for 48 billion U.S. dollars in
stock.
</P>
<P>
The deal could become the largest industrial merger in history.
The combined company will be called BP Amoco PLC, but in the
United States, BP gasoline stations would be renamed Amoco,
according to an AP report.
</P>
<P>
The deal surpasses the 36 billion dollar purchase of Chrysler
Corp. by Germany's Daimler Benz announced in May. Overall, the
deal ranks fifth, behind some big transactions in banking and
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
Amoco is already the biggest producer of natural gas in North
America, and combined with British Petroleum's production in
Alaska the company would be the biggest producer of oil and gas in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
BP is already the world's third largest oil company and the
deal will make it a bigger rival to No.1 Royal Dutch/Shell and
No.2 Exxon Corp.
</P>
<P>
Based on last year's figure, the new BP Amoco would have annual
revenues of 108 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
BP chief executive Sir John Browne will head the new group. Its
board will be co-chaired by BP chairman Peter Sutherland and Amoco
chairman Larry Fuller.
</P>
<P>
Amoco's office in Chicago will be headquarters for the group's
North American refining, marketing and transportation business and
its worldwide chemicals business.
</P>
<P>
The BP Amoco group will have combined oil and gas reserves
equivalent to about 14.8 billion barrels, and daily production of
some 3 million barrels.
</P>
<P>
The companies said cost savings from the deal would add 2
billion dollars to annual profits by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
The Amoco last year sold about one-third of its domestic oil
and natural gas properties. For the first six months of this year,
Amoco's profits fell nearly by half to 673 million dollars.

GENEVA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Group of 21 has called for
the establishment of a subsidiary committee to deal with nuclear
disarmament after the Conference on Disarmament (CD) decided here
Tuesday to set up an ad hoc committee on the prohibition of
production of fissile material for nuclear purposes.
</P>
<P>
"The G-21 emphasizes that nuclear disarmament is the highest

"An ad hoc committee should be established in the CD to
commence negotiations on a phased program of nuclear disarmament
for the complete elimination of nuclear weapons with a specified
framework of time, including a nuclear weapons convention," said

The group said it put much emphasis on the "elimination of the
possibility of nuclear war and the threats derived from the
continued existence of nuclear weapons, and the use or threat of
use of nuclear weapons."
</P>
<P>
It expressed the hope that the proposed treaty dealing with
fissile material must constitute a nuclear disarmament measure,
and not only a nuclear non-proliferation measure, and be an
integral step leading to the total elimination of nuclear weapons.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin is
scheduled to pay an official visit to Egypt in the first quarter
of next year for political dialog with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Egypt's Middle East News Agency Tuesday quoted Russian Charge
d'Affairs here as saying that the two leaders will discuss, among
other things, the issue of establishing a just and durable peace
in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He said this issue is given top priority by the Russian foreign
policy.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov will visit Egypt to
prepare for Yeltsin's Cairo visit and consult with his Egyptian
counterpart Amr Moussa on the latest developments of the
deadlocked Mideast peace march, the Russian diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Russia, a co-sponsor of the Arab-Israeli peace
process, fully supports a Franco-Egyptian initiative on holding an
international conference to rescue the dying peace process.
</P>
<P>
"Moscow has greatly and positively welcomed the Egyptian-French
initiative as having been identical to Moscow's vision on the need
to coordinate endeavors to salvage the flagging peacemaking in the
Middle East," he added.
</P>
<P>
Moscow sees it that the Madrid conference principles,
especially the land-for-peace formula, should be applied in order
to achieve an Arab-Israeli overall settlement, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian diplomat added that Moscow works in parallel with
Washington in this field and denied any intention, on the part of
Russia, of competition with the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's forthcoming visit to Egypt is a reciprocal one to
Mubarak's trip Moscow in September last year. Primakov, a Mideast
expert, has visited Egypt twice since 1996.
</P>
<P>
Russia is a co-sponsor together with the U.S. of the 1991
Madrid Peace Conference. It is trying to boost its involvement in
the peace-making process after years of keeping a low profile.

As for WB fund supplied to Uganda, it goes in grant, project
loans or adjustment loans, with the last being used for
government policy actions, he said.
</P>
<P>
At present, the WB provides some 250 to 280 million U.S.
Dollars to Uganda in each fiscal year, two times the figure for
the 1996-97 fiscal year and five times more than that for the
1995-96 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Most of the loans are interest-free credits with 35-40 year
maturities, or the so called International Development
Association (IDA) loans while in few cases the credits are at
commercial interest, he added.
</P>
<P>
In the 1997-98 fiscal year, the WB gave Uganda a grant of 75
million Dollars, he added.
</P>
<P>
The WB-funded projects cover such key sectors as agriculture,
environment, livestock services, infrastruction construction,
water supply, power generation, AIDS prevention and so on. There
are nine upcoming WB-funded projects in Uganda.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- France has sent 18 million U.S.
dollars of humanitarian aid to Sudan's famine-stricken civilians
so far this year, said French Delegate Minister in charge of
cooperation with Africa Charles Josselin Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse (AFP) said that Josselin visited Khartoum
from Monday evening until Tuesday and would meet with the leader
of the Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA) John Garang in
Cairo on his way home late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He held talks with the leaders of the Sudanese organizations
for aiding southern Sudan and U.N. humanitarian aid agencies, such
as the World Food Program, in the Sudanese capital.
</P>
<P>
His talks with Sudanese officials focused on the famine
situation in Sudan and the peace efforts in southern Sudan to put
an end to the 15-year-old war between government forces and the
SPLA.
</P>
<P>
"We all know that there exists a direct link between the famine
and the civil war in the region," AFP quoted Josselin as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government and the SPLA signed a cease-fire
agreement on July 15 to stop fighting in the southern Bahr
al-Ghazal region, because of the severe famine striking the local
population.

ways of fighting the tuberculosis epidemic in the region.
</P>
<P>
The third annual general meeting of SATCI to be held in Harare
Thursday and Friday will be attended by delegates from 11
Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries.
</P>
<P>

Organisation (WHO) has a bleak picture of the global failure of
the health systems to deal with the burden of tuberculosis," a
statement issued Tuesday by the Zimbabwean Health Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
"However, in all SATCI countries, the Directly Observed
Treatment Shortcourse (DOTS) strategy has now been adapted and
either fully implemented or is in the process of being
implemented," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The meeting expects to analyze existing budget monitoring
mechanisms pertaining to the control of TB in the SADC region.
</P>

HARARE, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government has
told all refugees in the country to respect the laws of Zimbabwe
and warned it would take stern and appropriate measures against
any transgressors.
</P>
<P>
The warning comes after some refugees forcibly occupied
offices of United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)

<P>
"The government wishes to reiterate its continued commitment
in respecting its international obligations towards refugees and
other persons of concern to UNHCR," said a statement from the
Ministry of Public Service, Labor and Social Welfare.
</P>
<P>
"Whoever, the present conduct by the refugees and other
individuals compromises the government obligation to safeguard
life and property. It is also tantamount to a breach of the
obligation to respect the laws of Zimbabwe," said the statement
released Tuesday in Harare.
</P>
<P>
As for the other individuals who are not refugees or genuine
asylum-seekers, the government said the necessary, ordinary
immigration sanctions would be applied.

MAPUTO, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano reiterated Tuesday that Mozambican people should try
hard to contribute to the construction of the country and the
enhancement of people's living standard.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a ceremony marking the 500 anniversary of the
first Catholic mission in Mozambique, Chissano said that
Mozambique should continue its unity and cooperation with the
Catholic on the principle that Mozambique is a non-religious
country.
</P>
<P>
Recalling Papa Joao Paulo II's visit to Mozambique in 1988,
Chissano said the visit, in days of war, had given a great
impetus to the peace and national reconciliation in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said that the clergymen, priests and sisters who came to
the country during the colonial days, had helped expose the
atrocities by the colonialists in Mocumbura, Wiriano and other
districts of central Mozambique's Tete Province.
</P>
<P>
It is recorded that in March 1498 some priests conducted Mass
during their stay on Mozambique's Ilha de Mocabique island on

<HEADLINE> Israel Agrees to Negotiations on U.N. Nuclear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday that Israel would not object to
negotiations on formulating an international treaty to ban the
production of the fissionable material used to make unclear bombs.
</P>
<P>
But Israel Radio quoted the prime minister as telling the
cabinet that this attitude did not mean automatic Israeli support
for the final treaty. Israel still had principled objections which
it would try to clear up with the United States, he said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli representatives to the United Nations Conference on
Disarmament in Geneva was to officially announce Israel's
decision later Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The 61-member organization, which takes decisions by consensus
with each member having veto rights, has been awaiting words from
Israel as to whether it would agree to launch fresh negotiations
aimed at halting production of nuclear bomb-making material.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. nuclear disarmament body has tried since 1995 to
revive the stalled talks on banning production of plutonium and
highly enriched uranium. And Israel has been the only member to
oppose the talks since India and Pakistan came to board after
massive pressure in the wake of their nuclear tests last May,
diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu told the cabinet that U.S. President Bill Clinton had
requested Israel not to object to the formation of an ad hoc
committee which would start formulating the so-called "cut-off"
treaty.
</P>
<P>
To reassure those who raised their eyebrows, Netanyahu said
the formation of the committee was a "procedural process" and it
would take years before all countries participating could reach a
formulated and agreed-upon treaty.
</P>
<P>
Israel has made it clear that its support for the
establishment of the committee did not indicate it would
automatically support the final treaty, Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
Worried about the possible impact of such a treaty on its
policy of "nuclear ambiguity," Israel is demanding that the
U.S. give it firm guarantees that international inspectors are not
sent to inspect its nuclear activity as may be stipulated in the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
Israel's "don't ask, don't tell" nuclear policy, which aims to
keep others in dark over its true nuclear capability, has served
as a deterrence against potential attacks from hostile countries
in the region.
</P>
<P>
As a nuclear "threshold" state, Israel joined the Geneva
conference in June 1996 under a package which brought in 23
countries, including Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Gas Utilization Gains New Impetus in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Government of Nigeria
has recently encouraged business sector to exploit abundant
natural gas in the country for export and domestic use.
</P>
<P>
Nine oil and gas companies operating in the country last week
formed a national body Nigerian Gas Association (NGA) to
encourage the increased utilization of natural gas resources.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the association said that it would work
towards an enabling environment with the government for the
industry and encourage industry safety and environmental
standards.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that "as we move into the 21st century,
gas will increase in importance as a source of energy and
industrial feedstocks in Nigeria and as a source of export
earnings."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a consultancy agreement for the feasibility study
on the West African Gas Pipeline project was signed last week
with a view to entailing technical and commercial analysis of the
conditions required to implement the project.
</P>
<P>
The project was designed to meet the energy requirements of
the West African region through the transmission of natural gas
from Nigeria to Benin, Togo and Ghana for power generation and
other uses.
</P>
<P>
The West African country of Nigeria has an abundant natural
gas reserve which was estimated at more than 3,500 billion cubic
feet.
</P>
<P>
Available data shows that about 2.5 billion cubic feet of
associated gas is produced daily by oil companies operating in
the country, but only 30 percent of the volume is utilized
locally while the remaining 70 percent has been flared for the
past four decades.
</P>
<P>
It was estimated that the Federal Government of Nigeria had
incurred about two billion U.S. Dollars loss in revenue annually
as a result of the continued flaring of natural gas.
</P>
<P>
With the increasing awareness of environmental protection, gas
flaring has become unacceptable both to the government and to
those who reside around the flaring sites.
</P>
<P>
It is against this background that the Federal Government of
Nigeria has drawn some laws which are aimed at ending gas flaring
and promulgated regulations providing stiffer penalty for gas
flaring.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Nigerian government has introduced a
series of generous incentives for the use of natural gas in the
country, including duty- and VAT-free import of related machinery
and equipment, a five-year tax exemption period, zero percent
royalty and zero percent petroleum profit tax for gas used.
</P>
<P>
In an apparent response to the government moves, oil companies
operating in the country have now set targets for the elimination
of gas flaring and all indications show that the country may get
close to zero gas flaring by 2010.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Government of Nigeria has also invested billions
of Dollars in the Nigeria Liquefied Natural Gas Ltd. in order to
produce more liquefied gas for export.
</P>
<P>
All the major oil companies in the country have embarked on
projects to use gas associated with oil production with the
biggest project under construction at a cost of 3.8 billion U.S.
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that all these moves taken by the Nigerian
government and oil companies are prompted by the need to end gas
flaring in the country, conserve the natural resources and
protect the country's environment.
</P>
<P>
Globally, there is an increase in natural gas consumption with
an average annual growth rate of about 2.5 percent because of low
carbon and sulphur emissions, cost efficiency and greater
efficiency in combined cycle power plants.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Iran Agree to Enhance Ties: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Jordan and Iran have reached "good
understanding" on enhancing their ties in various fields,
Jordanian Foreign Minister Jawad Anani said here upon return from
a three-day visit to Iran.
</P>
<P>
Anani said that he delivered on Sunday a message from King
Hussein of Jordan to Iranian President Mohammad Khatami on
bilateral relations as well as other regional and international
issues of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
In the message, the king emphasized Jordan's keenness to
develop relations with Jordan in all fields and laid emphasis on
Jordan's concern over the image of Muslims and the need for
safeguarding Muslims' common interests, said Anani.
</P>
<P>
The king also invited Khatami to visit Jordan soon, and the
latter accepted the offer.
</P>
<P>
Anani said that during his stay in Tehran last week, he also
held talks with a number of other senior Iranian officials on ways
of boosting bilateral relations in various fields.
</P>
<P>
He said that he on Monday discussed with his Iranian
counterpart Kamal Kharazi the Arab-Iranian relations, especially
the obstacles blocking the progress in the Jordanian-Iranian ties
and the necessity to find solutions to them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Anani said that he also reached consensus with
Iranian officials that the Judaization of the Arab East Jerusalem
by Israel should be rejected.
</P>
<P>
Both sides thought that the Israeli measures in the Holy City
were illegal, unacceptable and unjustified, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tehran severed its diplomatic ties with Amman during the
1980-88 Iraqi-Iranian war because of Jordan' support to Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
The diplomatic ties were resumed in 1991, but have been
strained since 1995 when Jordan expelled an Iranian diplomat,
accusing him of performing acts incompatible with his status.
</P>
<P>
After the moderate Khatami was elected Iranian President last
year, the door was opened for better relations between Iran and
other states including Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Last November, Jordanian Crown Prince Hassan visited Iran to
attend meetings of the Organization of Islamic Conference, during
which he met Khatami and other senior officials to explore ways of
enhancing bilateral ties.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Praises Mandela's Role in Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat said Tuesday that he envisaged a particular
role for President Nelson Mandela in the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting with Mandela and his deputy Thabo Mbeki
in Cape Town, Arafat told reporters that he had a 20-minute talk
with Mandela focussing on the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We spoke frankly about that," Arafat said, but declined to
expand on what Mandela's envisaged role entailed.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his talks with Inkatha Freedom Party leader
Mangosuthu Buthelezi, Arafat said Palestine needed South Africa's
help "so that we can save this peace process".
</P>
<P>
Earlier, at a customary welcoming ceremony for visiting heads
of state, Mandela awarded Arafat South Africa's highest honor for
foreigners, the Order of Good Hope.
</P>
<P>
The award was in recognition of Arafat's contribution during
the struggle against apartheid and his commitment to a democratic
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Arafat in turn invested Mandela with Palestine's highest
decoration, the Star of Holy Jerusalem, for what he said was the
South African president's continued support for the just cause of an
independent Palestinian state, with Jerusalem as capital.
</P>
<P>
Mandela and Arafat also witnessed the signing of two bilateral
declarations of intent on health and education by Palestinian
Minister of Local Government Sa'eb Erakat, and South African
Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo.
</P>
<P>
Arafat Tuesday also met leaders of other opposition parties,
including National Party leader Marthinus van Schalkwyk and Pan
Africanist Congress leader Stanley Mogoba.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources said Mandela would host a banquet Tuesday
night at his residence in honor of Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived in Cape Town last night for a three-day state
visit, which, officials of the two sides said, was designed to
reinforce relations between Palestine and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is due to return to South Africa at the end of the
month for a Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) Summit meeting, during
which South Africa will assume the Chair of the NAM.
</P>
<P>
The 113-nation NAM has historically been a strong supporter of
the Palestinians.

JOHANNESBURG, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Lesotho's Prime Minister
Pakalitha Mosisili has undertaken to step down should the May
elections were proven to be seriously flawed, South African
Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mosisili's government and opposition parties Monday agreed to
the establishment of an international committee to investigate
opposition allegations of election fraud.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached after South African Deputy President
Thabo Mbeki brokered a meeting between the two sides on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a welcoming ceremony for visiting Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat in Cape Town, Nzo said the committee would
hopefully come out with its findings within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
"Both parties -- the government and opposition parties --
undertook to respect the result of those investigations," Nzo
said.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister was even saying if the investigations show
that indeed there was serious problems with the elections, they
are prepared to step down."
</P>
<P>
Nzo Monday accompanied Mbeki and Defense Minister Joe Modise
to Maseru, to try to broker an end to the dispute which has seen
government and opposition supporters pitted against each other.
</P>
<P>
At least one person was reportedly killed and 15 others injured

UNITED NATIONS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Tuesday expressed his deep concern over the latest
developments in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
An uprising by troops broke out on August 2 in the eastern part
of the country which seems on the trend of escalation. Kabila's
government has accused Rwanda and Uganda of playing part by
helping the rebels.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the secretary-general said he was disturbed at

and about acts of intimidation ans violence against humanitarian
workers and other international personnel. Annan said he was also
deeply concerned about instances of ethnically-motivated
persecution.

He reiterated his call to all parties to respect the human
rights and dignity of all civilians regardless of their origin, to
uphold the standards and principles of international humanitarian
law, to ensure the safety of U.N. personnel and all humanitarian
workers operating in the country.

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges Dialogue to Solve Kosovo Question </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Tuesday reiterated his call for the parties to the
Kosovo conflict to immediately start dialogue to end the current
hostilities.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued through his spokesman, Annan said he
remains convinced that the only path to a solution of the Kosovo
crisis is through dialogue.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed for a concerted international effort aiming at
a peaceful solution given the evident lack of political will of
the parties within the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY).
</P>
<P>
Annan reiterated his dismay at the steadily worsening situation
in Kosovo with wider implications for the region and urged the FRY
security forces to avoid acts of "scorched earth policy."
</P>
<P>
He "equally abhors the resort to violence and any suffering
which might be caused by Kosovars," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general is concerned that the evolving crisis, if
unchecked, could lead to a large-scale humanitarian disaster, as
winter is approaching.
</P>
<P>
Noting that there are reports of a vast number of displaced
persons without food and shelter, Annan called on the
international relief organizations to intensify their efforts in
Kosovo to prevent the situation from deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made in conjunction with the U.N. Security
Council's consultations on Annan's latest report on Kosovo which
covers the developments in July.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Kosovo is aggravated by the failure of the FRY
and the Albanian Kosovars to enter into serious negotiations on
the future status of Kosovo, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Increased heavy fighting between FRY security forces and the
so-called Kosovo Liberation Army raised the number of civilian and
military casualties to their highest point since the outbreak of
the conflict in February.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo, with an area of over 10,000 square km and a population
of 2 million, is a province of the Serbian Republic within the
FRY. Ethnic Albanians, making up 90 percent of the population,
have demanded independence of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The FRY government stands against, holding that the question
should be resolved within the incumbent Constitution, by providing
equal rights to all inhabitants in the FRY.

NICOSIA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- After nine consecutive days
of scorching heat, the worst heat wave in decades abated Tuesday
in Cyprus leaving 56 dead, most of whom are elderly people.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's temperatures fell to 39 degrees Celsius in Nicosia, 4
degrees lower than Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The small tragedy Cyprus went through in the past few days is

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Suggests Embassy Official Exchange With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 11 (Xinhua) -- In what regarded as a show of
intention towards the normalization of ties with Iraq, Lebanon
Tuesday suggested the two countries send officials to their
respective closed embassies in the other.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz,
Iraqi Ambassador to Jordan Nouri Ismail told reporters here that
Lebanon wants to appoint an administrative officer in its closed
embassy in Baghdad, the state-run National News agency reported.
</P>
<P>
It also hopes that Iraq do the same in order to handle
commercial services between the two countries, the ambassador
said.
</P>
<P>
The bilateral ties were severed following an assassination of
the Iraqi opposition figure Taleb Suhail al-Tamimi in Beirut in
1994.
</P>
<P>
Three Iraqi diplomats in Lebanon were convicted of killing
Tamimi and were arrested. One of them died in prison from a brain
haemorrhage and the others were later expelled.
</P>
<P>
Ismail also delivered a message from Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf to Boueiz which covered the bilateral
ties and ways of improving it.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts regarded the move as a significant step toward
restoring diplomatic relations as the business exchange between
the two countries is growing.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has gained a 50-million-U.S. dollar contract under the
Iraqi oil-for-food deal with the United Nations and is intending
to increase the amount to 100 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Rebuts U.N. Spokesman's Comment on Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Tuesday rebutted the
U.N. spokesman's statement that the U.N. Sanctions Committee did
not obstruct the approval of contracts that Iraq signed to buy
medicine and medical appliances.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency quoted a Foreign Ministry spokesman as
saying that U.N. spokesman Jone Miles' denial of any obstruction
on Monday did not reflect the truth.
</P>
<P>
He said that regarding the Iraq-U.N. oil-for-food program, the
U.S and British representatives in the Sanctions Committee did
obstruct, and are still obstructing the approval of these
contracts.
</P>
<P>
He said since the Iraq-U.N. memorandum of understanding on the
oil-for-food program came into force in December 1996, the
U.S. and British representatives have been trying to create
pretexts to hamper the implementation of it.
</P>
<P>
Because of the U.S. and British obstruction, in the first
phase of the oil-for-food deal, only 80 percent of the contracted
medicine and medical appliances arrived in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In the second phase, the proportion reduced to 50 percent, and
in the third phase, it further dropped to 0.5 percent, the
Iraqi spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The fourth phase of the oil-for-food program started on June 3
this year, but so far, none of the contracted medicine and
medical appliances have reached Iraq, he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman also charged the U.S. and British
representatives for blocking the implementation of many other
contracts such as those on Iraq's purchase of the badly needed
spare parts for its oil sector.
</P>
<P>
Under the fourth phase of the oil-for-food deal, Iraq is
allowed to export 5.2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil to
buy food, medicine and other humanitarian supplies for its
suffering people.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has imposed comprehensive sanctions on Iraq after its
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Egypt Tuesday hosted a meeting of
opposition leaders in northern and southern Sudan on how to end
the 15-year civil war in its southern neighbor.
</P>
<P>
The meeting groups John Garang, leader of the Sudanese People's
Liberation Army (SPLA), Al-Sadeq Al-Mahdi, former Sudanese Prime
Minister and leader of the Ummah Party, and Mohammed Osman
Al-Merghani, the head of the National Democratic Alliance, the
umbrella group for northern and southern Sudanese oppositions.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister Youssef Wali represented Egypt
at the meeting, said Egypt's Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, through its efforts to reconcile the conflicting
parties, is trying to close up ranks and preserve Sudan's unity,
diplomatic sources here said.
</P>
<P>
The SPLA, Sudan's largest rebel group, has been fighting for
autonomy of the largely Christian south from the Islamist north
since 1983. The civil war, combined with perennial famines, has
claimed more than 1.5 million lives in this North African country.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's meeting came after the peace talks between the
Sudanese government and the oppositions in the Ethiopian capital
of Addis Ababa ended Friday without any progress.
</P>
<P>
After four days of talks, differences remained over issues
including the cease-fire, border demarcation of southern Sudan,
the relationship between religion and state, and the referendum on
self-determination.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa is to meet with Garang on
Wednesday to discuss Egypt's efforts to close the gap between
Khartoum and the oppositions.
</P>
<P>
Sudan and Egypt have long been at odds over a border dispute
and have traded accusations of harboring rebel militants and
oppositions, but a tentative thaw in relations has been emerging
between the two sides in recent months.

<HEADLINE> Iran Rejects Taliban's Claim over Captured Diplomats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Tuesday rejected the
claim by the Afghan Taliban militia that it did not know the
whereabouts of 11 Iranian diplomats allegedly captured by it in
northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Tehran radio, Iran's special envoy on
Afghan affairs Alaeddin Boroujerdi termed the Taliban's claim as
a violation of the international laws and principles.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Iranian diplomats, now held by Taliban in
Qandahar, were sound and the Taliban can not shirk responsibility
for their safety.
</P>
<P>
The "Foreign Ministry" of Taliban regime issued a statement
earlier Tuesday saying that it did not know the whereabouts of the
11 missing Iranians. It added that if it had arrested them, they
would be tried and punished as agents of a hostile government.
</P>
<P>
Iran believed that the 11 Iranian diplomats and a
correspondent of the Iranian official news agency IRNA were taken
captive by the Taliban fighters on Saturday after they took over
Mazari Sharif, northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Iranians, who worked at the Iranian consulate in Mazari
Sharif, were reportedly late transferred to Qandahar, the Taliban's
headquarters in southern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Boroujerdi said all the staff members of the Iranian consulate
in Mazari Sharif were sent by the Iranian government and were
recognized as diplomats according to international laws.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope the issue would be solved through efforts
by the Pakistani government in the near future. Shortly after the
capture of the Iranian diplomats, Iran has contacted Islamabad to
seek Pakistan's help in securing the release of them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Boroujerdi confirmed that the Taliban militia also
arrested 31 Iranian drivers who transported goods to Afghanistan
and other central Asian republics.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban accused the Iranians of arming their enemies in
Mazari Sharif. Boroujerdi said that the arrest of the Iranian
drivers were against the humanitarian principles.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran has asked the International Committee of the
Red Cross to help secure the release of the Iranian nationals.

<HEADLINE> Elephants in Tanzania's Second Largest National </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Elephant population in
the Ruaha National Park, the second largest in Tanzania, has
increased significantly thanks to stern measures against poaching
in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Wildlife experts said Tuesday in Dar es Salaam that the
elephant population which shrank by half because of poaching in
the 1980s, has risen to 22,000 in the park and the adjacent game
reserve.
</P>
<P>
"The figure may be higher as the elephant family groups with
many young calves are frequently seen unlike in the past," the
principal park warden, Mtango Mtahiko, said at the park
headquarters in the city.
</P>
<P>
The Great Ruaha ecosystem, covering 10,000 square kilometers
in southern region of Iringa, has about 32,000 elephants in early
1970s but had been reduced by half by 1990.
</P>
<P>
According to Mtahiko, the present estimation is based on an
animal census carried out inside the 34-year-old park during 1993
and 1994.
</P>
<P>
Ruaha, second only to the Serengeti National Park in size,
currently takes lead in elephant population among the 12 national
parks in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Despite the tight security measures, elephants were still
killed in isolated cases by poachers who coveted after their
tusks in the park and adjacent areas.
</P>
<P>
Interestingly, in the 1970s there was great concern that large
number of elephants were destroying trees.

KUWAIT CITY, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia and Yemen are
continuing their work to demarcate borders between them on
Tuesday, in an effort to prevent further border-related clashes.
</P>
<P>
The joint Saudi-Yemeni military committee's meeting on the
issue finished their second day in the Saudi port city Jeddah
Tuesday with both sides showing willingness for a quick and final
agreement, the Kuwait News Agency quoted Arab diplomatic sources

The two neighbors on the Arabian peninsula share a
2,000-kilometer common border and have a decades-long dispute over
three Red Sea islands and parts of the desert region, where huge
oil reserves are expected.
</P>
<P>
The border dispute between the two countries often flared into
armed confrontation. The latest clashes on July 19 on the Dowaima
island in the Red Sea left three Yemeni soldiers dead.
</P>
<P>
A joint commission authorized to tackle border clashes reached
an agreement last week to maintain the status quo of Dowaima.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi-Yemeni committee was established in 1995, charged
with the mission of border demarcation. It is scheduled to meet
again on August 29 to put forward operational measures aimed at
preventing further clashes.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Stock Market Tumbles Over Asian Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's Istanbul Stock Exchange
plunged 7.35 percent in active trading Tuesday to 3,432.48 points,
amid concerns over the worsening Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish government's possible sharp devaluation of the
Turkish lira against Western currencies has also prompted
investors to sell shares on the market.
</P>
<P>
In the morning trading, the index dropped 10 percent to
3,343.91 points, but it rebounced slightly in the afternoon
session.
</P>
<P>
For the whole day, the National-100 Index lost 283.12 points,
or 7.35 percent, from Monday's finish.
</P>
<P>
The financial index dropped to 4,217.73 points, down 338.65
points, or 7.12 percent, the industrial index declined to
2,944.31 points, down 295.26 points, or 7.67 percent, and the
service index fell to 4,191.63 points, down 327.60 points, or
6.97 percent, from Monday's finishes.
</P>
<P>
This was the second day that the Istanbul Stock Exchange has
plunged following the Monday's fall of 226.34 points from last
Friday's
</P>
<P>
Turkish investors apparently feared that the crisis in Asian
markets may spread to dampen economic activities worldwide, thus
harming Turkey's exports.
</P>
<P>
On another hand, share traders speculated that Turkey might
have to devaluate the Turkish lira in a bid to keep its exporting
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Many of the currencies in Asian markets, led by the Japanese
yen, have been tumbling in the past week due to the economic
uncertainty in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Under the present system Turkey's Central Bank allows the
Turkish lira to devalue slowly in connection with the inflation
rate of the country.

<HEADLINE> Tajikistan Calls for Int'l Efforts on Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Tajikistan Tuesday urged Russian
President Boris Yeltsin to use his influence in strengthening the
borders of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) with
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting chaired by Tajik President Emomli Rakhmonov, the
Tajik Military Council called on member nations of the CIS and
parties to the Collective Security Treaty to take necessary steps
to strengthen the CIS's southern borders in the wake of the
deteriorating situation in Afghanistan, the Interfax news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The council meeting was also attended by the country's
parliament speaker and the foreign, defense, interior and security
ministers as well as the commander of the Russian border guards in
Tajikistan, the commander of the peacekeeping force and the
commander of Russia's 201st Motorized Division.
</P>
<P>
The Tajik leaders urged the CIS Council of Defense Ministers to
meet shortly to discuss the situation in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The council also appealed to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan
to take urgent steps to help end hostilities in Afghanistan and
find a political settlement of the conflict.
</P>
<P>
As large numbers of Afghan refugees move to the regions
bordering Tajikistan, Dushanbe fears a spontaneous influx of the
refugees in the country.
</P>
<P>
Some units of Russian and Tajik troops were already put on high
alert Tuesday along the Tajik borders with Afghanistan amid
reports that some Taliban fighters were sighted near the border.
</P>
<P>
The recent flare-up of fighting in northern Afghanistan has
worried Russia and the central republics bordering Afghanistan,
especially Tajikistan, which has the longest border with the
Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
In Uzbekistan, restrictions have been re-imposed on the
frontier garrison town of Termez and outsiders could not fly there
without special commission.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban fighters have reportedly captured the northern city
of Mazar-e-Sharif following their weekend offensive.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the Russian Foreign Ministry Tuesday
said Russia, together with other CIS countries, has the right to
take steps to protect its borders.
</P>
<P>
"The world community must take urgent and decisive steps to
prevent expansion of the conflict in Afghanistan and its spill to
neighboring countries," Foreign Ministry spokesman Valery
Nesterushkin told a press briefing.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Friend Testifies before Grand Jury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Prosecutors Tuesday
questioned U.S. President Bill Clinton's friend Harry Thomason and
a White House lawyer before a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
Thomason's testimony was followed by that of deputy White House
counsel Cheryl Mills. In the afternoon, a number of Secret Service
personnel were also subpoenaed to testify in the Lewinsky probe.
</P>
<P>
After winning a court battle over attorney-client privilege,
prosecutors have begun questioning some of the White House
lawyers, including Mills.
</P>
<P>
Thomason, a Hollywood television director, emerged from the
courthouse after about 90 minutes of testimony and said he was
questioned about the time he spent in the White House last
January, when he came to help advise Clinton on damage control.
</P>
<P>
"I've always believed the president was telling the truth,"
said Thomason.
</P>
<P>
"I thought the grand jurors were nice, and the prosecutors were
courteous. And it was actually a good morning," Thomason added as
he departed for the offices of his lawyer, Robert Bennett, the
same attorney who represented Clinton in the Paula Jones sexual
harassment lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
Independent counsel Kenneth Starr is looking into whether
Clinton and Lewinsky had sex and whether he urged her to lie about
it in the Jones lawsuit. Clinton has denied a sexual relationship
with Lewinsky, 25. But she, according to legal sources, told the
grand jurors that contrary to the president's sworn denial and her
own affidavit in January, did have a sexual relationship with him.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Clinton's personal attorney, David Kendall, obtained
permission from U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright to view
the videotape of Clinton denying under oath January 17 that he had
a sexual relationship with Lewinsky.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon: U.S. Seeks Diplomatic Solution to Kosovo Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States still seeks
a goal of reaching a diplomatic solution to the Kosovo crisis
despite the threat by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) to intervene militarily, said Pentagon on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a regular briefing, Pentagon spokesman Ken Bacon
said, "Our goal in Kosovo is to reach a diplomatic solution to the
problem. I think we've been very clear about that from the very
beginning."
</P>
<P>
Last week, the State Department said the alliance is finishing
a package of military intervention plans on Kosovo, demanding
Belgrade to stop its offensives against ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
"If there is any military involvement in Kosovo, it will be
done through NATO, not unilaterally by the United States," said
Bacon.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, U.S. Ambassador to Macedonia, Christopher Hill, was
in the provincial capital, Pristina, to meet with Ibrahim Rugova,
leader of the Kosovo Albanians and Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister
Nikola Sainovic.
</P>
<P>
Serbian officials said that ethnic Albanians guerrillas had
killed 10 policemen in Kosovo during a clash.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic Albanian rebels are fighting for independence of
Kosovo, where 90 percent of the population are Albanians. However,
it gained no supports around the world.

<HEADLINE> Russian Securities Market Plunge Continues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Russian stocks continued to drop
Tuesday, with most of the blue chips sliding 10-15 percent while
some shares dropped as much as 20-25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The RTS-Interfax Composite Ruble Index was off 9.69 percent to
a record low of 27.84 points. The RTS-1-Interfax index fell 9.11
percent to 109.91 points, the lowest since May 1996, the Interfax
news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Mounting pressure for a devaluation of the ruble and the crisis
on the market in government securities would possibly force the
central bank to increase the refinancing rate, currently at 60
percent, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Fear that Russia would not be able to cope with the escalating
servicing costs on both its external and internal debt, prompted
foreign investors to sell off some Russian Eurobonds, which in
turn helped to dampen the mood of Russian investors, Interfax
reported.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Russia's Deputy Finance Minister Oleg
Vyugin told Interfax that the government has set aside 2 billion
dollars for servicing domestic debt in August.
</P>
<P>
The dive Tuesday on Russian markets led to technical halts to
trading on the RTS and the Russian Stock Exchange under Federal
Securities Commission rules, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
At 18:00 Moscow time (14:00 GMT) Tuesday, Unified Energy
Systems of Russia common shares were down 10 percent to 0.0905
U.S. dollars on volume of 73.55 million shares, while Lukoil fell
12.9 percent to 5.4/5.49 dollars on 525,000 shares and Mosenergo
dropped 7.5 percent to 0.04/0.0405 dollars on 80.2 million shares.
Rostelekom fell 14 percent to 1.45/1.5 dollars on 983,000 shares.
</P>
<P>
Volume on the RTS was 18.754 million dollars on Tuesday,
slightly higher than Monday's total of 15.187 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Gazprom shares, which are traded on the Moscow Stock Exchange,
fell 14.2 percent to 1.63 rubles per share on volume of 23.435
million rubles, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Market operators expect the market to continue its plunge. They
attribute it to a threat of ruble devaluation and a possible hike
of refinancing rate, both signs of weakness of the government and
the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Some also point to the shortage of rubles in the market as one
reason that caused the downward turn of the Russian securities
market.
</P>
<P>
Financial experts offer mixed predictions on the movement of
refinancing rate of the central bank. Some believe the rate would
not be raised any time soon as the central bank had already
dropped the practice of providing commercial banks loans with
securities as mortgages since late June.
</P>
<P>
Under this circumstance, they say, raising refinancing rate
would have little direct impact on the financial market.

<HEADLINE> German States Impose Traffic Restrictions amid Heat Wave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Four German federal states are to
impose temporary traffic restrictions on Wednesday to reduce air
pollutions and prevent excessive concentration of ozone in the hot
summer air.
</P>
<P>
In the German states of Baden-Wuerttemberg, Hessen,
Rhineland-Palatinate and Saarland, cars without catalytic
converters will not be allowed to go onto the streets for 24 hours
up from 6 a.m. on Wednesday, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The new regulation is meant to reduce the level of summer smog
which can lead to excessive concentration of ozone above the
ground which is unhealthy to the human body.
</P>
<P>
As air temperatures soaring in Germany recently, the tolerable
maximum ozone value of 240 micrograms per cubic meter air was
surpassed in several locations in Germany on Tuesday,
meteorologists said.
</P>
<P>
During Tuesday afternoon, meteorologists also reported
Germany's highest-ever air temperature of 41.2 degrees centigrade
in the Mosel River Valley. Local record-high temperatures were
also reported in many other German cities.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Air Force has
resumed training flights of its B-2 stealth bombers after four
days of grounding because of a problem with the crew ejection
system, the service said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"They are back to normal flying operations," said Air Force
spokesman Major Tyrone Woodyard.
</P>

The radar-avoiding bombers, built by Northrop Grumman Corp.
with a cost of some 2 billion dollars each, were all returned to
training as of Monday.

The Air Force said last Thursday that a potential problem
associated with initiators which operate the air crew ejection
system. Parts in the ejection systems had been replaced before the
resumption of flights.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 21 stealth bombers the government planned to build
have been manufactured, but are not yet in active service. Some
ten of them have been delivered to the Air Force and are based
with the 509th Bomb Wing at Whiteman Air Force Base in Missouri.

ATHENS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Greece decided Tuesday to reward
persons who provide information leading to the arrest of
arsonists.
</P>
<P>
The decision, signed by Greek Public Minister George Romeos and
Finance Undersecretary Nikolaos Christodoulakis, provides for a
reward of between 5 and 20 million drachmas (about 1.7 and 6.7
million U.S. dollars) per fire, the semi-official Athens News

<HEADLINE> Tunisia Voices Support for Libya on U.N. Embargo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUNIS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Terming the U.N. embargo against
Libya as "unacceptable and unjustifiable," Tunisia said Tuesday it
will stand by Libya in confronting the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Hamed Karoui, prime minister of Tunisia, made the remarks upon
his arrival in Tripoli, capital of Libya, the Tunisia Africa News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
But the news agency did not say if Karoui went there by air to
break the U.N. imposed air embargo on Libya.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed the air and arms embargo on 1992 after Libya
refused to hand over two Libyans, suspected of bombing a Pan-Am
airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988, for trial in the
U.S. or Britain.
</P>
<P>
Libya has insisted the trial be held in a neutral country to
ensure its justice.
</P>
<P>
Three African leaders have defied the embargo by flying to
Libya last month.
</P>
<P>
And the Organization of African Unity also made a call in June
for its members to ignore the sanctions as of September 1 if the
U.S. and Britain made no compromise.
</P>
<P>
Karoui, leading a high-level delegation on a two-day working
visit, is going to hold talks with his Libyan counterpart Mohamed
al-Mangoush on ways to enhance bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Karoui said the talks will serve as "another brick in the
palace of the fruitful cooperation and constructive integration
between the two countries in the face of regional and
international challenges."

JOHANNESBURG, August 11 (Xinhua) -- South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki Tuesday accused Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu of buying time to implement his own programs
rather than work toward peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting with visiting Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat in Cape Town, Mbeki said it was surprising that
Netanyahu had not accepted the United States' proposals aimed at
enhancing the peace process in Middle East.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association (SAPA) quoted Mbeki as saying
that the proposals had been accepted by the Palestinian National
Authority.
</P>
<P>
"It seems to us that all that Netanyahu is doing is to try to
buy time to implement his programs, rather than work for peace
for the whole Middle East region," said Mbeki.
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process remained a critical issue and
South Africa would do everything possible toward its achievement,
Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived in Cape Town at around midnight Monday for a
three-day state visit to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and South African President Nelson Mandela Tuesday held
private talks about the faltering Middle East peace process and
witnessed the signing of two bilateral declarations of intent on
health and education.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders exchanged decorations. Arafat gave Mandela
the Star of Holy Jerusalem, and Mandela invested Arafat with
South Africa's highest civilian honor, the Order of Good Hope.

<HEADLINE> Albright Praises African Cooperation in Bombing Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said on Tuesday that she was heartened by
cooperation from Kenya and Tanzania in probing into last Friday's
bombings of U.S. embassies.
</P>
<P>
"I have been heartened by the close cooperation we have had
with authorities in Kenya and Tanzania from the moment the
tragedies occurred," Albright told ambassadors and charges
d'affaires of 30 African countries in Washington, who came to
the State Department to offer condolences.
</P>
<P>
"I want to thank you for the help that your governments have
provided by sharing information and tightening security at our
embassies in recent days," she said.
</P>
<P>
The bombings at U.S embassies in Kenya and Tanzania have
killed more than 200 people, including 12 Americans, and wounded
over 5,000.
</P>
<P>
The United States has dispatched FBI agents to Africa to
investigate the bombings but there was no word in Washington on
Tuesday of any significant leads so far.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian police said on Tuesday they had arrested 14
foreigners in their search for bombers. The 14 foreigners, six
Iraqis, six Sudanese, a Somali national and a Turk, were rounded
up because they failed to explain their presence in the country
satisfactorily.
</P>
<P>
Albright announced on Monday to offer a reward of up to 2
million U.S. dollars for information leading to the arrest and
conviction of the bombers.
</P>
<P>
She told African envoys that she looked forward to visiting
Kenya and Tanzania but would wait until she could do so without
placing undue burdens on the heavily stretched U.S. embassies
there.
</P>
<P>
She also said the bombings would not prevent the United States
from building "a strong new relationship with a new Africa."
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Ambassador Ahmed Maher el-Sayed, on behalf of the
African envoys, condemned the "cowardly, criminal and tragic"
bombings.
</P>
<P>
"Terrorism is inconsistent with our African history, our
tradition, our culture and our beliefs," he said. "Americans and
Africans need to strengthen their cooperation in this universal
battle" against terrorism.

<HEADLINE> New Electoral Commission Inaugurated in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- A new electoral body, the
Independent Electoral Commission (INEC) was inaugurated Tuesday
in Nigerian capital Abuja, thus kicking off another round of
transition to civil rule program by the ruling military regime.
</P>
<P>
The new electoral body has 14 members, including its Chairman,
Justice Ephraim Akpata.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inauguration ceremony, Nigerian Head of State,
General Abdulsalam Abubakar charged the INEC to "work extremely
hard to ensure that the federal government fulfills its solemn
promise to the hand-over date of May 29, 1999."
</P>
<P>
"This is a promise we have solemnly made and it is a promise
we are committed to keep," he was quoted by the official News
Agency of Nigeria (NAN) as saying.
</P>
<P>
General Abubakar asked the the new electoral body, appointed
by him last Thursday, to work out within two weeks the guidelines
for political party formation, registration and other tasks that
are relevant to a successful, free and fair electoral process
that will usher in true democracy.
</P>
<P>
In the next two weeks, INEC was also to draw up a timetable
for various elections under the transition program, including
that of local government councils, state and national assemblies,
state governors and the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
According to the new transition program announced by Abubakar
on July 20, the presidential election is to be held within the
first quarter of 1999, while the new civilian president will be
inaugurated on May 29, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar canceled all the elections held under the transition
to civil rule program of his predecessor, General Sani Abacha,
saying that it had lost all its credibility and acceptability due
to massive rigging.
</P>
<P>
The new head of state went a step further by sacking all the
five political parties as well as the National Electoral
Commission, promising a new democratization process to be
monitored by a truly independent electoral body.
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's inauguration, Abubakar promised that his
government will provide the necessary legal, financial and
logistics support to ensure that the electoral commission works
effectively toward hitch-free elections.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel
arap Moi has indefinitely postponed his state visit to South
Africa in the wake of last Friday's bombing in Kenya's capital
Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
According to South African Foreign Ministry spokesman Marco
Boni, the cancellation of the visit was a combination of the bomb
blast and the fact that Kenyan Trade Minister Joseph Kamotho, who
was supposed to accompany President Moi on the trip, was injured
in the blast.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan president was scheduled to arrive in South Africa
for his first state visit on Thursday. The visit was to have
focused on the lowering of trade tariffs and increasing trade
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
However, President Moi will be in South Africa at the end of
the month to attend the Non-Aligned Movement summit in Durban.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Duty-Bound to Support Palestine: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 11 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela said Tuesday night that his country had a duty to
support the Palestinian people, who are seeking justice and
equality.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a banquet in Cape Town in honor of visiting
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, Mandela said South Africa
would play its part in ensuring that Palestine assumed its
rightful position internationally.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said South Africa, along with the rest of the world,
hoped that the deadlock in Palestinian-Israeli talks would give
way to a recognition that the security of any one nation depends
on that of others, and that no one can enjoy lasting peace while
others remain in conditions that perpetuate injustice, poverty
and insecurity.
</P>
<P>
Mandela spoke highly of the generosity of the Palestinian
people and their support for South African democratic struggle
against apartheid.
</P>
<P>
Now that South Africa had achieved freedom, "we have not
forgotten our friends and allies who helped us liberate
ourselves, " said the South African president.
</P>
<P>
South Africa was proud of being part of the international
consensus affirming the right of Palestine to self-determination
and statehood, Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to playing our humble part, within the
limits of our resources, to help ensure that Palestine assumes
its rightful position in the global arena, " the 80-year-old
president said.
</P>
<P>
In response, Arafat said that South Africa's support and
backing for the Palestine's right to self-determination was
highly appreciated.
</P>
<P>
It would strengthen and solidify Palestine's position in
achieving freedom and independence, he said, adding that South
Africa's successful transition to a non-racial democracy was a
source of inspiration to the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived in Cape Town, the legislative capital of South
Africa, Monday night for a three-day state visit to the country,
the first of its kind since the two countries formally
established diplomatic ties in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Palestinian leader had talks with Mandela, his
deputy Thabo Mbeki, and leaders of opposition parties in South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Mandela also awarded Arafat South Africa's
highest honor for foreigners, the Order of Good Hope. In return,
Arafat invested his South African counterpart with Palestine's
highest decoration, the Star of Holy Jerusalem.

<HEADLINE> Largest Yangtze Flood Peak Advancing Downstream </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The fifth Yangtze River flood
crest passed Yichang at 8:30 pm this evening and is advancing
downstream to Shashi, all in central Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
The water level at Yichang was measured at 54.03 meters, with a
flow rate of 62,800 cubic meters per second, the largest since the
flood season began. However, the city's 167-kilometer-long Yangtze
embankment has stood the flood tests.
</P>
<P>
Before the peak came, the city organized 85,000 workers to
protect the embankment at a spot where a landslide occurred this
morning.
</P>
<P>
This was brought under control 8 hours later, sources said,
adding that Yichang is preparing for another flood crest which is
now forming in the upper reaches.
</P>
<P>
To ease floodwater pressure at Jingjiang, the Qingjiang
Hydroelectric Station managed to reduce the floodwaters going
downstream in an effort to keep the water level at Shashi below 45
meters, the ceiling mark for diverting water into the Jingjiang
Diversion Zone where 330,000 people live.
</P>
<P>
The provincial Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters
has asked related areas to keep alert for possible flooding and to
reinforce dikes and embankments.

<HEADLINE> Mainland Visitors' Spending in HK Remains Biggest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Spending by visitors from the
Chinese mainland remained the biggest contributor to Hong Kong's
tourism receipts from January to June this year.
</P>
<P>
Their spending in Hong Kong accounted for 26.6 percent of the
total, according to figures released by the Hong Kong Tourist
Association here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The total spending by visitors to Hong Kong registered a
36.5-percent drop to 24.6 billion HK dollars (3.15 billion U.S.
dollars) during the period.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan took second place, followed by the Americas and Europe,
Africa and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The drop in visitor spending reflected the fall in tourist
arrivals.
</P>
<P>
From January to June, total tourism receipts fell by 35.6
percent to a total of 25.6 billion HK dollars (3.28 billion U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Other major factors that contributed to the fall in spending
include the currency depreciation in Asian markets, which has
considerably lowered the spending power of visitors from those
countries, lower hotel rates, the reduction in prices for shopping
items and a shorter average length of stay by visitors, the
association said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
reiterated Wednesday the need of maintaining Sudan's territorial
integrity and reinforcing efforts to end decades of fighting in
this neighboring state.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak made the remarks in the northern resort of Alexandria
during his meeting with Sudanese opposition leaders, who began
their meetings with Egyptian officials in Cairo Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He urged the Sudanese government and various opposition
factions to exert serious efforts in order to achieve unity.
</P>
<P>
"All Sudanese popular forces should be unified to drive back
threats facing their country ... Egypt is determined to back all
efforts exerted in this regard," said the president.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's meeting was attended by John Garang, leader of the
biggest rebel group the Sudanese People's Liberation Army (SPLA),
Al-Sadeq Al-Mahdi, former Sudanese Prime Minister and leader of
the Ummah Party, and Mohammed Osman Al-Merghani, the head of the
Democratic Unionist Party.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo and Alexandria meetings are part of Egypt's bid to
bridge the gaps between the opposition and Khartoum on one hand
and among the opposition factions on the other.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Garang Tuesday, Egyptian Deputy Prime
Minister Youssef Wali said Cairo is eager to offer help to Sudan's
famine-stricken south.
</P>
<P>
The SPLA has been fighting for autonomy of the south from Sudan
since 1983. Fightings combined with perennial famines have claimed
more than 1.5 million lives, most of them civilians.
</P>
<P>
The latest series of meetings were held after peace talks
between the Sudanese government and the opposition in the
Ethiopian capital of Addis Ababa ended Friday without progress.
</P>
<P>
After four days of talks, differences remain on issues of
cease-fire, border demarcation of southern Sudan, the relationship
between religion and state, and the referendum on
self-determination.
</P>
<P>
Sudan and Egypt have long been at odds over a border dispute
and have been accusing each other of harboring rebel militants and
opposition factions.

especially cases of destruction of public facilities, stealing,
robbing or raping flood victims, dereliction of duty and
misappropriation of relief funds and goods, and spreading rumors
or hoarding and profiteering.
</P>

BRUSSELS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The chief of the North Atlantic

over continuing fighting in Serbia's southern province of Kosovo.

</P>
<P>
Solana said NATO fully supports the efforts of the

</P>
<P>
The secretary general told the ambassadors from member states
that NATO's military authorities had been authorized to informally
approach nations on the forces they would be ready to contribute
to possible air operations in Kosovo, should the occasion arise.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's council meeting, held during the month-long summer
recess of the alliance, reviewed NATO's military planning for a
full range of options aimed at bringing an end to the fighting in
the Yugoslav province, and creating conditions for negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Solana said the options included the use of ground as well as
air power.
</P>
<P>
NATO, to demonstrate its readiness for deployment in the
Balkans, conducted an airborne joint exercise in mid-June in
Albania and Macedonia, both bordering Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
But the western military alliance failed to get an action
mandate from either the United Nations Security Council or the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Russia, the Cold-war foe of NATO, strongly opposed the use of
force by the bloc in Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Protests Foreign MPs' Visits to North </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus on Wednesday protested
the recent visits by foreign parliament members to northern
Cyprus, which is controlled by its Turkish Cypriot rivals.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' House of Representatives made the protest in a
statement issued in response to a Turkish Cypriot press report
Tuesday that six Albanian parliament members are currently visiting
the north of the divided Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
The statement denounced the Albanian MPs' visit to northern
Cyprus, the third in one week by foreign parliament members, as
"part of Turkish Cypriots' move to gain international recognition."
</P>
<P>
Members of parliament from Italy and Kyrgyzstan also paid a
visit to northern Cyprus last week.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Cyprus had sent a letter of protest to
Italian President of the Chamber of Deputies Luciano Violante.
</P>
<P>
In his reply, Violante noted that the tour of Italian
parliament members was unofficial and private, and the Italian
Parliament does not recognize the entity in the "occupied areas of
Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus will also make representations to the Albanian and
Kyrgyz parliaments over the visits, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops took over the northern third of the island in the wake of a
failed pro-Athens coup by Greek Cypriots in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots unilaterally declared in 1983 a breakaway
"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus," which is only recognized
by their closest ally Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Albright to Bring Back Remains of Bombing Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright left for Germany Wednesday to bring back the remains of
U.S. victims of last week's embassy bombing in Nairobi, Kenya.
</P>
<P>
She planned to visit 10 hospitalized Americans and Kenyans
injured in the bombing, that killed more than 240 people,
including 12 Americans, and injured well over 5,000. Albright will
bring back 10 of the 12 remains.
</P>
<P>
"I go secure in the knowledge that America will never be
intimidated or back down in the face of terrorists," Albright said
before departing from Andrews Air Force Base, near Washington.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of Albright's departure, the State Department
announced that "there may be a threat to U.S. interests in Egypt,
Malaysia and Yemen that could include attacks on buildings."
</P>
<P>
Americans in the three countries were advised to be careful. A
senior U.S. official said the statement was based on "credible
information," but he declined to provide further details.
</P>
<P>
In the face of increased threats, the U.S. State Department has
decided to shut half a dozen embassies and some embassies would
have to be relocated to guard against terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
"We have to make sure all our embassies can meet an adequate
standard," Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering said.

CAIRO, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs

</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- The number foreign tourists visiting Egypt this year
is expected to rise to 3.25 million, an increase of 8.3 percent
from 1997, the Egyptian daily Alam Al Yom reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A report by the Egyptian National Assembly predicted the
revenues of tourism could reach 10.3 billion Egyptian pounds (3
billion U.S. dollars), an increase of some 800 million pounds (233
million dollars) from last year.
</P>
<P>
The report said the volume of investment in tourism projects
this year is estimated at about 4.8 billion pounds (1.4 billion
dollars), of which 4.6 billion pounds (1.3 billion dollars) are
spent on private projects.
</P>
<P>
JEDDA -- President of the Islamic Development Bank Ahmed
Mohamed Ali opened in Jedda Monday a meeting of regional
organizations of the bank's member states to discuss the
inter-state trade among the Organization of Islamic Conference
(OIC), the Arabic daily Al Hayat reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, which is due to end Wednesday, was attended by OIC
representatives as well as the action group in charge of examining
the prospects of promoting inter-state trade among the Bank's
member states.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Egyptian Petroleum Minister Hamdi Banbi has said that
demand for natural gas in Egypt will reach 52 billion cubic meters
by the year 2017, the Al Hayat reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He added that 485 kilometers of pipelines will be extended for
the transport of natural gas to a number of governorates in lower
and upper Egypt and Oyoun Moussa in Sinai, raising the demand to
3.1 million cubic feet per day.

meters per day will be provided to meet the needs of the
production and service sectors in the new cities.
</P>
<P>
DUBAI -- Dubai's gold imports during the first six months of

the Indian government to liberalize trade in the precious yellow
metal, the Al Hayat reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But officials of the World Gold Council anticipated that the
Gulf emirate will remain the biggest center for gold transactions
in the world.

<HEADLINE> Expert Warns of AIDS Epidemic in Estonia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, August 12 (Xinhua) -- An expert has urged the Estonian
government to take more steps in containing the spread of AIDS,
saying that the Baltic nation is on the verge of an AIDS epidemic.
</P>
<P>
Nelli Kalikova, head of the country's center for the
prevention of AIDS, told the Baltic News Service (BNS) Tuesday
that lack of sex education and growing number of drug addicts were
the main causes of AIDS in Estonia.
</P>
<P>
She said official statistics on the number of carriers of HIV,
the virus that causes the deadly disease, and the death rate among
AIDS patients does not reflect the actual situation.
</P>
<P>
Since 1988, Estonia registered 79 HIV carriers, 13 of whom
already died, but the actual numbers are at least five times
higher, Kalikova said.
</P>
<P>
"For a country with a population of just 1.5 million, this is
very serious," she said.
</P>
<P>
Kalikova said the country's incidence of venereal diseases
such as syphilis, gonorrhea, hepatitis B and C is also growing,
mainly as a result of syringe sharing by drug addicts.
</P>
<P>
"Drug addiction has infected all sections of the population,"
Kalikova said. "During a recent police raid, drug addicts were
found even in the park of the presidential palace."
</P>
<P>
In neighboring Russia, there were better news about AIDS. The
number of newly registered HIV carriers there, at 1,468, dropped
16 percent in the first six months of this year, said First Deputy
Health Minister Gennady Onischenko on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 8,956 HIV carriers have been registered in Russia
since 1987, the Interfax news agency said.

<P>
BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide donation campaign
to aid flood-stricken areas in the Yangtze River Valley is now going
strong.
</P>
<P>
The Work Committee of the Departments Directly under the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee and the Work

</P>
<P>
The donation activities must be brought under the supervision
of auditing departments, the media and the public, the notice
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Wuhan, one of the hardest-hit cities, has so far received more
than 20 million yuan in cash and materials, and the city
government has set up a working group to follow the entire process
of distributing and using the donations.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, China's largest economic and financial center,
donated 15 million yuan to Hubei Province this afternoon, and
private entrepreneur Guo Ziwen from south China's Guangdong
Province also donated 500,000 yuan to the province.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Why Flooding at Nenjiang River? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Why is record flooding rolling
high along the Nenjiang River in northeast China at a time when
the water level on the Yangtze River is receding?
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists attribute this directly to continuous rainfall
and incoming water from the river's tributaries.
</P>
<P>
Rainfall at the Nenjiang River has been caused by the same
atmospheric conditions prevailing over the Yangtze River, so the
two areas have had rainfall at almost exactly the same time.
</P>
<P>
The abnormal climate across the world brought about by El Nino
in 1997, the strongest such in a century, triggered off China's
unusual flooding this year, experts say.
</P>
<P>
Since mid-June, the weather conditions in Eurasia has been
blocking rain clouds from moving northward, while rain clouds
over China have been stopped from moving eastward, causing
torrential rains in the two river valleys.
</P>
<P>
Northeast China has had more rainfall during this year's flood
season, in particular over the past week, when the two watersheds
were hit by torrential rains.

GENEVA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The International Cycling Union
has postponed to Thursday the release of its report on the battle
against doping.
</P>
<P>
Cycling's governing body in Lausanne hopes the document,
originally due out Wednesday, will kick off an all-out attack
against drugs after its public image was tarnished by the
revelations of widespread drug taking during the Tour de France
cycling race.
</P>
<P>
"It's a starting point for the future in the fight against
drugs," UCI spokesman Enrico Carpani said here Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Coffee Machine Triggers Arafat Security Scare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The parcel that triggered a
security scare in South Africa's parliamentary complex in Cape Town
ahead of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's arrival contained no bomb
or explosives, officials confirmed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The parcel contained a coffee machine sent by a Cape Town company
to President Nelson Mandela's parliamentary advisor Ahmed Kathrada as
a surprise birthday gift, Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's office said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The parcel was detonated at the gates of Mandela's Cape Town
office, Tuynhuys, by the bomb disposal unit of the South African
police.
</P>
<P>
"Following the detonations, the bomb experts have confirmed that
the parcel did not contain any bomb or explosive device," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"Their actions, however, were justified in the context of the
uncertainty around the content of the parcel, and the detonation was
necessary as a precautionary measure."
</P>
<P>
The controlled explosion reverberated through the
parliamentary complex at about 11.30 a.m. (0930 GMT), amid
tightened security ahead of Arafat's arrival at parliament, South
African Press Association (SAPA) said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat was due to meet National Assembly Speaker Frene Ginwala
and address a joint sitting of both houses of parliament.
</P>
<P>
Tight security has characterized Arafat's visit to Cape Town,
with members of the VIP protection unit and police out in full
force, a helicopter hovering above the city, and snipers on the
roof of parliament, according to SAPA.
</P>
<P>
Mandela is on African National Congress business in Pietersburg and
was not present at Tuynhuys Wednesday morning.

<HEADLINE> Manila Finalizes Screening of Bond Offers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Department of
Finance has already finalized the screening of proposals for the
issuance of bonds, the Philippine News Agency said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu as saying
that in spite of the depreciation of the peso, "the Philippines
continued to enjoy a fair spread in its planned bond offering from
investors who made firm offers."
</P>
<P>
Fourteen foreign investment banks had submitted proposals on
the issuance of government bonds, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Espiritu revealed that the government has chosen Goldman Sachs,
J. P. Morgan and Warburg Dillon Read to underwrite a two-phased
bond offering in the international market.
</P>
<P>
He said the government would do two bond offerings in sequence
with the first possibly in September and the second in October.
</P>
<P>
The proceeds of the bond offerings are intended to help finance
the country's budgetary requirements, he said, adding that the
government hopes to raise at least 500 million U.S. dollars from
the offerings.
</P>
<P>
One of the offerings would involve the issuance of U.S.
dollar-denominated floating yield securities in the global market
and the other the issuance of euro-denominated fixed rate
securities in the European market.
</P>
<P>
The two bond offerings would be the first for the Estrada
administration and would prove the continuing attractiveness of
the Philippines to international investors in spite of the
continuing crisis, Espiritu said.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Soldiers Fire Stun Grenades at Protesters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Lesotho army fired stun
grenades at protesters outside King Letsie III's palace in Maseru
Wednesday afternoon after the crowd defied an order to disperse.
</P>
<P>
There was chaos and panic when soldiers fired and it was not
known whether there was any injuries, South African Press
Association (SAPA) quoted opposition parties spokeswoman Monica
Mopeli as saying.
</P>
<P>
"They started shooting at about 2.10 p.m. (1210 GMT) and it is
chaos here with people running in all directions. We have not
established how many, if any, people have been injured at this stage,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
The army action followed an earlier order by army chief
Lieutenant-Colonel Makhula Motakeng for the protesters to disperse.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties defied the order, saying several issues
should be cleared before they could leave the royal palace.
</P>
<P>
These included opposition parties' representativeness in the
Independent Electoral Commission panel that is to re-count the votes
of the May 23 general election.
</P>
<P>
The protesters are demanding the king to intervene in the political
impasse and overturn the results of the election. But the king refused
to be involved.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho Prime Minister Pakalitha Mosisili Wednesday called for calm
and restraint.
</P>
<P>
He called on supporters of his ruling Lesotho Congress for
Democracy (LCD) to remain calm and refrain from doing anything that
could worsen the situation.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that as leader of the LCD it had come
to his attention that party members had been provoked and
incensed by the situation which faced the government they had
elected.
</P>
<P>
"I appeal to them to exercise restraint until the peaceful and
legal process agreed by the political party leaders and the government
is completed," he said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to an agreement between his government and
opposition parties on the establishment of a southern African
committee to probe into election fraud allegations.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, however, appeared to be unable to appease the
protesters.

the two separate bombing incidents in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam last
Friday, which killed more than 200 people and injured over 5,000
others.

He said terrorists are shifting their targets of attack, but most
of the victims have been innocent civilians.

Terrorism cannot be left be uncurbed, he said, and called on people
who have clues to inform the police as soon as possible so that the
criminals behind the blast could be brought to justice at an early
date.

The Nigerian embassy which is still in chaos has moved to the
Karibu Hotel in the city to resume office service, while repairs
of the Algerian ambassador's residence are to be completed in one

The French embassy is waiting for experts to evaluate its loss
arising from the blast.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong Wednesday called upon ASEAN countries to uphold its core
principles and goals while concentrating on solving serious
economic problems facing them.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a banquet in honor of visiting Lao Prime Minister
Sisavath Keobounphan, Goh said, "ASEAN is currently facing many
serious challenges. While ASEAN should develop new responses to
these challenges, we must not unwittingly undermine the core
principles that have kept ASEAN united through the past 31 years."
</P>
<P>
"It is at such times of great uncertainty that we should
together keep faith with ASEAN's core principles," he added.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said, "To restore confidence in the ASEAN
economies, the realization of AFTA (ASEAN Free Trade Area) has
become even more urgent. Advancing the AFTA timetable will send a
powerful signal to international investors of the determination of
ASEAN countries to open their economies to trade and investment."
</P>
<P>
The Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) groups
Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
On the regional situation, Prime Minister Goh noted, "The
region is in the grips of a financial and economic crisis."
</P>
<P>
"In many other countries, the economic crisis has weakened
their political and social fabric," he said. "Externally, the
crisis has reduced the international prestige of this region."
</P>
<P>
"Singapore remains positive about the long-term prospect of the
region," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
He also made clear that the region's inherent strengths and
resilience are widely acknowledged, saying, "We can turn the
financial crisis to advantage, by confronting difficult economic
issues and introducing much-needed measures to reform and
strengthen our economic and legal framework."
</P>
<P>
"The regional crisis also shows how interdependent and
interconnected our economies are and how important it is for us to
work together to overcome it," he stressed.

three-day official visit.

<HEADLINE> New Refuse Transfer Station Opened in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A refuse transfer station
capable of processing 2,500 tons of waste per day and serving a
population of 1.5 million people in its catchment was officially
opened here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Located at the West Kowloon Reclamation Area, the transfer
station, the largest of its kind in terms of waste handling
capacity, was built at a capital cost of 627 million HK dollars
(80.38 million U.S. dollars) and with an annual operating cost of
about 77 million HK dollars (9.87 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Michael Stokoe, acting director of Environmental Protection,
said at the opening ceremony that this station is designed with a
high tolerance to accommodate short-term surges and irregularities
in waste throughput to suit the unique situation in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
All the wastes received at the station are compacted into
specially-designed sealed containers which will be transferred by
marine vessels to a landfill in West New Territories for final
disposal.
</P>
<P>
Stokoe said the newly-built refuse transfer station is
operating to very high environmental standards whereby all air and
effluent emissions from the facility would be properly treated
before discharge.

<P>
FUZHOU, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A new local regulation aimed at
protecting the investment rights of overseas Chinese has recently
been approved by the Standing Committee of the provincial People's
Congress of east China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
"The regulation will help improve Fujian's investment
environment and stop such illicit activities as arbitrary charges
levied on overseas Chinese investors," said a senior provincial
official.
</P>
<P>
The province has benefited greatly from its large population of
overseas Chinese who contribute some 70 percent of the province's
overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
The regulation clearly states that the necessary examinations
of enterprises funded by overseas Chinese can only be conducted
by a certain group of government departments, and also must be in
strict accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the regulation legalizes preferential treatment for
overseas Chinese investors in areas such as taxation and
infrastructure.

<HEADLINE> Israel: Sanction on UNITA Helpful for Angolan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli government has
decided to observe the United Nations resolution of imposing
sanctions on the rebels in Angola, wishing that it may help the
materialization of real peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
Zeev Boim, a parliament member of the ruling Likud group,
made the remark on arriving here Wednesday for his three-day
visit aimed at promoting cooperation between Angola and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Boim said that though Israel is one of the biggest diamond
processors in the world, it has informed the United Nations of
its support for the sanction on the diamond-rich southern African
country. Israel is one of the earliest countries to give active
respond to the U.N. decision, he added.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. passed a resolution on June 12, banning all the bank
accounts of the leaders of the National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) abroad, and banning any import of
diamond without the permission of the Angolan government.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolution also bans any trade activities involving
mining equipment and labor service in areas not controlled by
the government.
</P>
<P>
Boim said Israel has some thing in common as it is trying to
end the war with Arabians and win peace as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel and Angola are both concerned about the
peace process in their respective countries, they both want
to realize peace in their countries, but the road of peace is
not a smooth sailing.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Angola established diplomatic relations in 1992.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A United States military
rocket carrying a classified spy satellite for the Pentagon
exploded during lift-off in Florida on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force's giant Titan 4 rocket, launched at 7:30 a.m.,
one-and-a-half hours late because of fueling problems, split apart
about a minute into flight, showering debris over the Atlantic
Ocean, the Associated Press said.
</P>
<P>
The boom could be heard miles away. But the Air Force said
there were no injuries and no danger to nearby residents in Cape
Canaveral, on the east coast of Florida.
</P>
<P>
Fumes from the exploded fuel wafted out to sea and dispersed
within a half-hour.
</P>
<P>
The Titan 4, powered by solid-fuel boosters, is the largest
unmanned rocket built by Lockhead Martin Corp. in the United
States. It was carrying a secret satellite for the National
Reconnaissance Office, reportedly costing about one billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The rocket should have been launched in late July, but was
grounded so workers could repair torn insulation on the rocket's
upper stage.
</P>
<P>
The last time a rocket exploded at Cape Canaveral Air Station
was in January 1997, when a Delta blew up seconds into flight. In
August 1993, a Titan 4 rocket blew up at Vandenberg Air Force Base
in California.

<HEADLINE> Saudi King Undergoes Gall-bladder Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabian King Fahd Bin
Abdel Aziz underwent a successful operation to remove his
gall-bladder earlier Wednesday, the royal court announced in a
statement in Riyadh.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the king was in good health after the
operation, which was conducted at the King Faisal Hospital in
Riyadh by an American surgeon from Duke University in South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
A team of Saudi doctors assisted in the operation, it added.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi monarch was admitted to the hospital 10 days
ago, where he underwent a colon operation on August 3.
</P>
<P>
King Fahd, 77, was admitted to hospital last March for
treating an infection on the gall bladder.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the king's health suffered from fatigue and stress.
Upon the doctors' advice, he spent a three-month period of
recuperation, during which the state affairs were managed by Crown
Prince Abdullah Bin Abdel Aziz.
</P>
<P>
King Fahd, who took power in 1982, is the fifth monarch of
Saudi Arabia, which was founded by his late father, Abdel Aziz
Al-Saud in 1931.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Restores Freedom for Trade Unions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Government of Nigeria
has signed into law a new decree restoring freedom for trade
unions in the country as part of its efforts for national
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The decree was signed by Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalam Abubakar shortly before he administered the oath of
office on members of the Independent National Electoral
Commission on Tuesday in the Nigerian capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
The new decree also gave a legal backing to the reconstitution
of the Academic Staff Union of Universities which was also banned
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government abrogated the decrees outlawing the
Nigeria Labor Congress (NLC), the National Union of Petroleum and
Natural Gas Workers and Petroleum and Natural Gas Senior Staff
Association of Nigeria in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The repealed decrees were promulgated in 1994 after a
protracted oil workers' strike which almost paralyzed the
country's economy under the late General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
The oil workers in Nigeria went on a nationwide strike in
protest against the annulment of the June 12, 1993 presidential
election which was believed to have been won by late Bashorun
Moshood Abiola, a renowned opposition leader.
</P>
<P>
Since then, a series of sanctions have been imposed on Nigeria
by western countries and international organizations, especially
the International Labor Organization.
</P>
<P>
In response to the government action, Adms Aliyu Oshiomhole,
General Secretary of the National Union of Textile Garment and
Tailoring Workers, said the government gesture is commendable.
</P>
<P>
"We are happy with this development since we have been asking
for the abolishment of all obnoxious decrees promulgated to
suppress labor," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I have every reason to believe that the government will keep
to its promise. I have confidence after all the government has
started restoring peace to labor in the country," the labor
leader added.

<HEADLINE> UK Unemployment Falls to Lowest for over Decade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Unemployment rate in Britain has
fallen to the lowest level for more than a decade, according to
official figures published here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Both the number of people claiming benefit and the total
looking for work were lower in July, according to figures from the
Office for National Statistics. This is expected to dispel
somewhat fears of a gloomy outlook for the jobs market following a
series of recent job loss announcements.
</P>
<P>
The government's preferred measure of counting unemployment, or
the ILO system, which includes people not eligible for benefit,
fell by 62,000 in the three months to June to 1,802,000. This is
the lowest total since the ILO definition was first introduced in
1984.
</P>
<P>
The ILO unemployment rate is now 6.2 percent, down from 6.5
percent in the previous three months and 7.2 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The Office for National Statistics said improvement in the
labor market is continuing, although at a slower rate.
</P>
<P>
The figures saw a fall in the number of 18 to 24-year-olds,
including students, signing on for benefit, indicating that the
tighter benefit regime is having an effect.
</P>
<P>
General productivity was 1.4 percent higher in the first three
months of the year compared to a year ago, but manufacturing
productivity fell by 0.5 percent in the three months to June.
</P>
<P>
Also, figures for average earnings showed a rise of 5 percent
in the year to May, down 0.4 percent from the previous month, the
lowest increase since February.
</P>
<P>
However, private sector pay rises continued to outstrip
increases in the public sector, though the figures showed the gap
was closing.
</P>
<P>
Previous monthly rises in average earnings were a major factor
in the Bank of England's decision to increase interest rates
because it feared higher wages would lead to a rise in inflation.
</P>
<P>
The figures surprised many economists, who generally painted a
bleak prospect for the economy, the labor market in particular, as
a growing number of manufacturers are laying off workers, blaming
high interest rates and the strength of sterling.
</P>
<P>
Union leaders have called for the government to act to counter
the strength of the pound, but the government has defended its
economic policies, offering the prospect of a "turn around" for
business by the beginning of next year.

<HEADLINE> Siberian Tigers Being Protected Against Floods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Prolonged rain storms and
flooding have abruptly raised the water level of the Songhuajiang
River at Harbin in northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, posing
a serious threat to the 52 Siberian tigers in the province's
Siberian tiger breeding center.
</P>
<P>
"The river's water level was only one meter lower than the
northern embankment yesterday afternoon, and the embankment was
kept intact thanks to the efforts of hundreds of people," said Li
Wei, office director of the Siberian tiger breeding center.
</P>
<P>
The center, the largest in the world attempting to adapt
Siberian tigers to wild life, is located only 400 meters from the
river's northern embankment.
</P>
<P>
The water level of the Songhuajiang River at Harbin, capital of
Heilongjiang Province, rose to 118.96 meters this afternoon, and
people are busy consolidating the dikes, said an official with the
city's flood control center.
</P>
<P>
"The city government is taking emergency measures to
consolidate the dikes, and preparations are underway to evacuate
the tigers to another wild animal breeding center in Henghedaozi,
more than 200 kilometers from here," said Liu Xingchen, head of
the breeding center.
</P>
<P>
The river's water level is expected to rise again when a new
crest approachs this section in the near future, the city's flood
control center said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Siberian tigers in the breeding center are
enjoying a cool summer and paying no attention to the possible
danger. The No. 52 tiger killed two oxen today, and the No. 37
tiger baths itself each day in a pond.
</P>
<P>
The Siberian tiger is one of the most endangered animals, with
only about 300 left in the world. China set up a Siberian tiger
breeding center in 1986 and has now bred more than 100 tigers. The
center in northern Harbin was established in 1996 to train the
tigers born in captivity to adapt to life in the wild when they
are eventually returned to their natural habitat.

<HEADLINE> China's Major Power Plant Starts Generating Electricity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANZHIHUA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The first generator at the
Ertan Hydroelectric Power Station, which will be the largest
to be completed in China this century, began generating
power on a trial basis at 5:20 p.m. today.
</P>
<P>
The 550,000-kw generator is capable of producing 15 million kwh
of electricity a day. It is presently the largest hydroelectric
power generator in China.
</P>
<P>
Liu Junfeng, general manager of the Ertan Hydro-power
Development Corporation, said the operation of the first generator
indicates that each auxiliary power plant project has met the
prescribed technical specifications and requirements, and its
operation will help relieve energy pressure in central and western
China.
</P>
<P>
Work on the main part of the Ertan station began on September
14, 1991. The Ertan Hydro-electric Power Station is the second
largest hydro-power project in China following that at the Three
Gorges on the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Located on the Yalong River in southwest China's Sichuan
Province, Ertan will have 6 generating units, each with a capacity
of 550,000 kilowatts, said Liu, adding that the project is
expected to be complete next year.
</P>
<P>
By that time, the Ertan will be generating 17 billion kwh of
electricity a year.
</P>
<P>
The Yalong River, a tributary on the upper reaches of the
Yangtze River, originates in the Bayan Khara Mountains in
northwestern Qinghai Province. It flows mainly through Sichuan
Province, and generators with a combined generating capacity of 24
million kilowatts can be installed along the river.
</P>
<P>
Liu said the first generator at Ertan is now the largest in
the country; and the second one, whose installation will be
finished in two days, will be put into operation in November.

<HEADLINE> First-half Tourism Receipts Fall in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong saw a sharp drop in
total tourism receipts in the first half of this year as visitor
arrivals faltered, the Hong Kong Tourist Association (HKTA)
announced here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
From January to June, total tourism receipts fell by 35.6
percent on a year-on-year basis to 25.6 billions (3.28 billion
U.S. dollars). Spending by visitors tumbled by 36.5 percent to
24.6 billion HK dollars (3.15 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The HKTA said that the decline in visitor spending echoed the
fall in arrivals, which went down by 21 percent over the first six
months. Currency depreciation in Asia also considerably reduced
the purchasing power of visitors from the region as they stayed
shorter and spent less.
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the HKTA showed that visitors from the
Chinese mainland remained the biggest contributor, whose spending
accounted for 26.6 percent of the total. In terms of actual per
capita expenditure, visitors from the Americas took the lead with
an average spending of 5,779 HK dollars (740 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Shopping remained to top the expenditure category, accounting
for almost half of the total spending by inbound tourists,
according to the HKTA.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's total tourism receipts reached 72.1 billion HK
dollars (9.24 billion U.S. dollars) in 1997.

LANZHOU, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Management modernization is the
key to the economic development of western China. This is the
consensus reached recently by experts and scholars from both sides
of the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
During the 6th Cross-Straits Seminar on Chinese Modernization,
which ended Tuesday in the city of Lanzhou, capital of northwest
China's Gansu Province, participants all agreeed that despite
natural environmental factors, an underdeveloped management method
is the primary cause of the backwardness in vast western China.
</P>
<P>
In order to realize the modernization of management, local
governments must improve the efficiency of government
departments, enhance the exploitation and training of talented
people, and establish a modern enterprise system in western China,
according to the conferees
</P>
<P>
They also believe that local governments should do their utmost
to improve infrastructure construction, adhere to the reform and
opening-up policy, and rejuvenate western China through science

CHENGDU, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Water conservancy and hydropower
stations in Sichuan Province have engaged in active efforts to
divert the heaviest flooding in 44 years to alleviate serious
threats to areas on the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze
River.
</P>
<P>
The facilities have either stored and diverted over
11 billion cu.m. of floodwaters surging down the Yangtze River
throughout the summer, according to recent statistics.
</P>
<P>
The province, located on the upper reaches of the river, has
experienced 14 heavy rainstorms since June. All major water
conservancy and hydropower stations in Sichuan have been urged to
engage in a maximum effort to divert water and reduce the impact of
flooding on the lower reaches of the river.

<P>
BEIDAIHE, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese State Councilor Wu Yi,
in a meeting here today with Stephen Van Andel, chairman of U.S.'s
Amway, congratulated the company on its successful conversion from
direct sales to shop sales and said she appreciates Amway's
understanding of China's decision to forbid all direct sales.
</P>
<P>
She said that President Bill Clinton's China visit helped
promote the Sino-U.S. relations and the United States has changed
the "Most Favored Nation" status into "Normal Trade Relations",
but the annual status review still leaves U.S. businessmen with a
feeling of instability.
</P>
<P>
She explained that China is still in a period of transition
from a planned to a market economy and its laws and regulations
are not perfect, the people in direct sales are not of very high
quality, and consumers are not very mature either, so direct sales
are not appropriate in China.
</P>
<P>
Van Andel said Amway is still full of confidence about the
China market and will observe the law anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
Amway (China) Co., Ltd. was etablished in 1992 as a Sino-U.S.
equity joint-venture, with total investment of 100 million
U.S. dollars and 80 million US dollars in registered capital.
</P>
<P>
Its parent company, Amway, was set up in 1959 in the United
States and now does business in at least 80 countries and regions,
where it sells its products through direct sales.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Protesters Defy Army Order to Disperse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Several hundred protesters
outside Lesotho King Letsie III's palace in Maseru remained in
defiance of an order from the army to disperse on Wednesday
morning.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association (SAPA) quoted opposition
Basotho National Party official Bareng Sekhonyana as saying that
there were a number of issues that needed to be resolved before
the protesters could disperse.
</P>
<P>
These included opposition parties' representation in the
Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) panel which is to re-count
the votes of the May general election.
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to disperse here until these issues are
cleared to our satisfaction. We want representatives in the IEC
because if they re-count the votes alone, they would just confirm
the (initial) results of the elections," Sekhonyana said.
</P>
<P>
He said these issues had been raised during discussions with
the army chief, Lieutenant-Colonel Makhula Motakeng, and
opposition parties were awaiting his response.
</P>
<P>
"We also informed him that this is a political problem and
that he should not intervene. The protesters are orderly and they
are not causing any damage to the shops in the area."
</P>
<P>
The order to disperse was issued by Motakeng and broadcast by
a radio station Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
When the protesters refused to leave on Wednesday morning,
troops moved in and surrounded the palace and the protesters.
</P>
<P>
Sekhonyana said there were about 500 protesters outside the
palace gates. More protesters were being barred by police from
joining the protest.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy swept 79 of 80
parliamentary seats in the May 23 election. But opposition
parties had refused to accept the results, saying the election
was rigged in favor of the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
Through the mediation of South African Deputy President Thabo
Mbeki, the Lesotho government and opposition parties agreed
Monday on the establishment of a southern African committee to
probe into election fraud allegations.
</P>
<P>
However, it appeared that the agreement was unable to appease
protesters.

<HEADLINE> Iranians Scuffle with Pakistani Embassy Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 11 (Xinhua) -- More than 20 riot policemen with
sticks and shields Wednesday morning rushed to surround the
Pakistani embassy here and pushed back protestors after scuffles
broke out.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators were demanding the release of 11 Iranian
diplomats, an official news agency IRNA reporter and 32 drivers,
allegedly captured by the Afghan Taliban in northern Afghanistan
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The angry demonstrators argued with police officers while
others shouted anti-Taliban and anti-Pakistan slogans. The
situation came under control after about 10 minutes and an IRNA
reporter who forced his way into the embassy was released by
embassy staff.
</P>
<P>
With his trousers torn, Abolfazl Shaker said that he was beaten
by a dozen of embassy staff members who struck him against the
gate, breaking the glass of the gate.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had no intention to enter the embassy but
wanted to ask the ambassador to answer questions of the
demonstrators. He was dragged into the embassy when he pushed open
the entrance gate.
</P>
<P>
Iran has said that it held the Taliban and Pakistan, who is
widely believed to be supporting the Islamic student militia,
responsible for the safety of the Iranians. They were reportedly
taken captive after the Taliban forces seized Mazar-e-Sharif, the
main stronghold of opposition Northern Alliance.
</P>
<P>
The more than 100 demonstrators included IRNA staff, wives and
relatives of the IRNA correspondent and drivers.
</P>
<P>
Before they dispersed, the protestors issued a statement,
condemning the Taliban for capturing Iranian reporter and
diplomats and urging for their immediate release.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taliban announced on Tuesday that they did not
arrest any Iranian diplomats and the Iranian consulate in
Mazar-e-Sharif had been evacuated.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic student militia said if the Iranians are arrested,
they will not be recognized as diplomats and will be tried and
punished as agents of a hostile government.
</P>
<P>
Iran rejected the Taliban claim, and called its acts as a
violation of international laws and norms. It urged Islamabad to
use its influence to ensure the safety and release of the Iranian
nationals.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani embassy said in a press release Tuesday saying it
was not be responsible for developments in Afghanistan but will
render every possible assistance to ensure the safety of the
Iranians.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian King Willing to Play Conciliatory Role </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian King Norodom
Sihanouk said he would be pleased to play a conciliatory role if
asked to do so by two or three of the major political parties,
opposition party leader Sam Rainsy said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The King also said he would be prepared to preside over
a 'Siem Reap Informal Meeting' if requested by two or three of the
major parties," Sam Rainsy said.
</P>
<P>
Sam Rainsy, president of Sam Rainsy Party (SRP), and his
five-member delegation Wednesday met with King Sihanouk in Siem
Reap to discuss ways for forming the new government after the
general election.
</P>
<P>
Rainsy described the two-hour meeting as a "private
conversation."
</P>
<P>
"The king congratulated the National Assembly Members-elect of
the SRP and said he considers the SRP as now having a role in the
government of Cambodia," Rainsy continued.
</P>
<P>
The king said it was advisable for the parties to have
dialogue, according to Rainsy.
</P>
<P>
Rainsy said to the King that the proposed Siem Reap Informal
Meeting could be a way to break a possible deadlock and that the
SRP will consider this suggestion.
</P>
<P>
Incumbent Second Prime Minister Hun Sen reacted immediately to
the king's suggestion, saying that he was ready to take part in
the meeting at any time.
</P>
<P>
Prince Norodom Ranariddh and his Funcinpec Party has not yet
made any comment on the king's suggestion.
</P>
<P>
Funcinpec and the SRP, the second and third largest political
parties, had been boycotting the results of the election, claiming
that there were fraud and irregularities in the voting and ballot
counting and that the seat-allocation formula changed by the
National Election Committee (NEC) was illegal.
</P>
<P>
With the NEC no longer considering election complaints, Sam
Rainsy's only legal option is to take his grievances to the
Constitutional Council. But Sam Rainsy doubts the Council will be
fair.
</P>
<P>
In response, he has planned a series of demonstrations in the
country to show public support for his refusal to accept the
election results. The first demonstration is scheduled for this
weekend in the capital, but it has not yet been arranged in
details.

lingering fears over regional currency devaluation.

The benchmark Straits Times Industrial Index (STII) dropped
12.16 points to 995.77 points to record a fresh 10-year low, and

</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the sharp fall on Wall Street overnight as
well as concerns over the region's economy and expectations of
poor corporate results had cast a pall on the market.

BEIDAIHE, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese State Councilor Wu Yi,
in a meeting here today with Stephen Van Andel, chairman of U.S.'s
Amway, congratulated the company on its successful conversion from
direct sales to shop sales and said she appreciates Amway's
understanding of China's decision to forbid all direct sales.
</P>
<P>
She said that President Bill Clinton's China visit helped
promote the Sino-U.S. relations and the United States has changed
the "Most Favored Nation" status into "Normal Trade Relations",
but the annual status review still leaves U.S. businessmen with a
feeling of instability.
</P>
<P>
She explained that China is still in a period of transition
from a planned to a market economy and its laws and regulations
are not perfect, the people in direct sales are not of very high
quality, and consumers are not very mature either, so direct sales
are not appropriate in China.
</P>
<P>
Van Andel said Amway is still full of confidence about the
China market and will observe the law anywhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
Amway (China) Co., Ltd. was etablished in 1992 as a Sino-U.S.
equity joint-venture, with total investment of 100 million
U.S. dollars and 80 million registered capital.
</P>
<P>
Its parent company, Amway, was set up in 1959 in the United
States and now does business in at least 80 countries and regions,
where it sells its products through direct sales.

<P>
LAGOS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A Nigerian senior army officer
has criticized the call for regional military forces in the
country under a new political arrangement, saying: "the
consequences of such a gesture can be very grave."
</P>
<P>
"There can never be regional armies in Nigeria, whatever the
situation," said Nigeria's Chief of Defense Staff Air Vice
Marshall Al-Amin Daggash, who came to the current position early
last month.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was not in order, he said Tuesday, adding it
would be unrealistic to think of regional forces, the Post

</P>
<P>
The armed forces have recognized their subordinate role to the
civilian authorities as they prepare to hand over in May next
year to an elected government, Daggash told visiting members of
the African Refugees Foundation.
</P>
<P>
The military has ruled Nigeria for more than two decades since
the country won its independence from the British colonial master
in October 1960. A May 29, 1999 deadline for the military to
quit power was set by the current military regime three weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, two of Nigeria's three major ethnic groups,
the Igbo and Yoruba which have been fighting for a power shift
from the northern Hausa people, called in separate deliberations
for the establishment of regional armies.
</P>
<P>
It was the only way of addressing the "marginalization"
presently going on in the military, they argued.
</P>
<P>
The call, according to the Igbos, followed the non-appointment
of an officer from the Igbo-speaking areas into any of the
command positions in the military during the re-alignment of its
officers recently.
</P>
<P>
The Defense Headquarters has condemned the calls, saying they
are politically motivated and promotions in the military are
purely by merit.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Khalid Jafri, author of the
book "50 Dalil Mengapa Anwar Tidak Boleh Jadi PM" ("50 reasons why
Anwar can not become PM" was charged in the Sessions Court here
Wednesday with maliciously publishing false news.
</P>
<P>
The book is alleged to defame Deputy Prime Minister Anwar
Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
Khalid, 58, pleaded not guilty to publishing the book which
contained "false news" in para 12 of page 29, at the office of
Media Pulau Lagenda here in May this year.
</P>
<P>
The charge under Section 8A (1) of the Printing Presses and
Publications Act 1984 carries a jail term not exceeding three
years or fine not exceeding 20,000 ringgit (about 5,000 U.S.
dollars), or both on conviction.
</P>
<P>
Judge Mohamad K. Abdul Rahman fixed August 19 for mention of
the case. The court room was packed during the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
The Judge granted Khalid bail of 5,000 ringgit (about 1,250
U.S. dollars) in one surety as applied by defense counsel Mohamed
Haniff Khatri Abdullah who said that there was no danger posed as
an injunction had been obtained against the author Khalid and
Media Pulau Lagenda.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Haniff told reporters later that he filed an appeal on
Monday against the decision of the High Court on July 31 granting
the injunction to Anwar.

NEW DELHI, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Secretary to the Union
Ministry of Industry T.R. Prasad said Wednesday that India's
industrial exports have registered a negative growth rate of eight
percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating a national seminar on "administrative reforms to

of New Delhi, Prasad said, "Indian industry is losing on
competition in the international market and there is a need for
correction."
</P>
<P>
The country's industrial export grew by 22 percent during
1995-96 and by two percent in 1996-97 and 1997-98, he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is a need to create a competitive environment for Indian
industry to flourish besides improving the infrastructure
facilities," he said, adding "We cannot expect Indian industry to
compete globally with the present infrastructure deficiency."
</P>
<P>
The reform process had to be accelerated in the country, he
added.

<HEADLINE> Breached Dike in Jiujiang Cemented </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JIUJIANG, August 12 (Xinhua) -- After five days of strenuous
effort, a 60-meter-long breach in the Yangtze River embankment at
Jiujiang section in east China's Jiangxi Province was cemented
completely this afternoon, declared the provincial deputy governor
Huang Zhiquan on the scene.
</P>
<P>
The make-shift dike is some 1.2 meters higher than the Yangtze
water level, which has dropped to 22.74 m now, 0.03 m lower than
the same time on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Some 4,000 soldiers and civilians are still working to further
fortify the newly-built section of embankments, which has been
built in a shape of a trapezium, 4 meters wide at the top, 18
meters at the bottom, and nearly 100 meters long, sources said.
</P>
<P>
At 2:10 this afternoon, soldiers began to position iron
frameworks into the last 2-meter gap, and dump sandbags to link up
the opening.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to repair the damage started shortly after a section of
the concrete embankment was breached around 1:10 pm on Friday,
four kilometers west of downtown. Rescuers sank eight boats and
dumped truckloads of rocks, rice, soybeans and whatever else was
at hand into the breach because of a severe shortage of filling
materials. By now, more than 20,000 tons of stone, or 9,400 cubic
meters, have been used in the effort.
</P>
<P>
However, technical problems, a lack of expertise and inadequate
equipment slowed the work.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, a team of army experts has been summoned from Hebei
Province in north China to help Jiujiang plug the breach. And the
army experts decided to hammer in dozens of steel pipes in four
rows into the breached dyke, while a 90-meter cofferdam has been
built next to the breach to slow the flow of water.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers successfully put up a framework by striking hundreds
of steel pipes into the breach, and sandbags and other filling
materials were added to the framework to plug the breach
completely.
</P>
<P>
"The previous dumping of boats and other materials has slowed
down the water flow by one-third and laid a good foundation for
our operation," said an expert.
</P>
<P>
People have built a dike 5,000 meters long at a spot two
kilometers from the breach, and a second dike 3,000 meters long
and four kilometers away from the first, to prevent a four-sq-km
flooded area in the western part of the city from expanding
further.
</P>
<P>
"With the completion of these two in-city dikes, I'm now quite
at ease," said Chen Zhenglai, deputy director of the Municipal
Water Conservation Bureau and head of the flood control
headquarters for the city's urban districts.
</P>
<P>
The flooded western part of the city, stranded in one-m-deep
water, includes a new industrial zone and home to 18 communities
and eight enterprises and institutions, with a population of
35,810.
</P>
<P>
Since the breach occurred, some 10,000 people affected by
floodwaters have been resettled in their relatives' houses or
factory buildings. There have been no reported casualties at the
breach so far, according to Governor Shu Shengyou and some
on-the-spot witnesses.
</P>
<P>
"Tents are not necessary for these relocated people, because we
have enough space for them to stay," said Chen, adding that
supplies of running water, electricity and daily necessities have
been adequate in the city.
</P>
<P>
The city proper of Jiujiang, an industrial center and tourist
attraction on the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, has an
urban population of 500,000 and covers an area of about 30 sq km.

confident that they will be safe," he told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
Police are providing additional security to the embassy which
too has its own security.
</P>
<P>
Tajol Rosli said providing the additional security was not
because the authorities thought that something would happen to the
embassy but because Malaysia always liked to take precaution.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
higher Wednesday in Sydney following remarks by Japanese officials
that the Japanese central bank would move to support the Japanese
yen when necessary.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished trade at 59.85 U.S. cents from
59.53 U.S. cents Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The currency had opened trade at two-month lows after the
Japanese yen slumped to fresh eight-year lows against the U.S.
dollar overnight.
</P>
<P>
However, a turnaround in both the yen and the Australian dollar
was affected by comments by Haruhiko Kuroda, a bureaucrat from
Japan's ministry of finance, suggesting the Bank of Japan was
ready to jump into the fray.
</P>
<P>
Kuroda said the Japanese government was concerned about any
deviation from fundamentals that the yen would take, and would not
hesitate to act if it deemed it necessary.
</P>
<P>
A nervous market, which had propelled the U.S. dollar to 147.61
yen Tuesday night, sold it off just as quickly, dropping two yen.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was changing hands at 87.34 Japanese yen
from 87.79 yen.
</P>
<P>
Eisuke Sakakibara, Japan's vice minister for international
affairs, added to the intervention rumor, saying "if it is
necessary, we will intervene."
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was also buying 1.0640 German marks from
1.0622 marks.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer said here Wednesday China's human rights position
had improved in the past 14 months, the Australian Associated
Press (AAP) reported.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister's remark came a day after China and
Australia concluded their second round of human rights dialogue
Tuesday in Canberra.
</P>
<P>
"Frankly in the last year there has been an improvement, even
if it hasn't been everything that any of us would like," the
foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
Proof of improvement was that China had committed to signing
two international human rights conventions, he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is now a growth of dialogue between China and other
countries on human rights issues rather than just the sort of
accusatory diplomacy we had in the past. So that is a constructive
thing," he said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister defended Australia's human rights dialogue
with China against criticism that it ignored major issues such as
China's one child policy, AAP said.
</P>
<P>
Downer said the talks had agreed on a wide-ranging Joint
Program of Cooperation on strengthening human rights.

PARIS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The French government has received thousands of petitions
from members of some ultra-conservative groups and catholic groups
which call for the abandoning of a project to legalize contract
between homosexual and heterosexual partners, which will be
discussed by the National Assembly on October 9.
</P>
<P>
-- The Congolese who are disappointed with the rule of President
Laurent-Desire Kabila are waiting for the outcome of the fighting in

<P>
-- France continued to suffocate under strong heat on Tuesday.
For the fourth day consecutive, big French cities registered the

<P>
-- The stock markets worldwide continued to suffer from the purge
on Tuesday with all the stock indexes falling in the United States,
Europe, Japan and Russia. The Japanese yen fell to its lowest in
eight years on Tuesday, while Japan's new prime minister seemed to
have used up all the cartridges for reviving the country's economy.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines Accelerates Rebuilding Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Airlines (PAL) said on
Wednesday that the firm is accelerating its rebuilding process as
the negative effects of the strike launched by its employees last
month are waning.
</P>
<P>
In a press release, PAL said that it envisions a more efficient
and reliable but reduced domestic and international airline
service with a manpower complement of 8,578, including 200 pilots,
and a young fleet of 21 jet planes averaging three years in age.
</P>
<P>
The airline management is confident that PAL still remains the
leader in the national air transport business despite its reduced
size because the company is way ahead of its closest competitors
in many areas.
</P>
<P>
The press release said PAL's closest competitor has only nine
airplanes compared with PAL's 25 state-of-the-art jets.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, PAL, the country's flag carrier, has retained 19
stations for domestic and seven for international after it
implemented a major downsizing program in June.
</P>
<P>
The confidence of the public in PAL is coming back as the
airlines' passenger load remained fairly high despite labor
problems and the lean season, the airlines said.
</P>
<P>
PAL, which is now under the receivership of the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC), continues coordinating with the
government agency to assure the success of a plan to rehabilitate
the national carrier.
</P>
<P>
The company, having been wracked by labor and financial
problems, is now run by an interim receivership committee. This
committee is finalizing a rehabilitation plan detailing the
strategies necessary to resuscitate the company.
</P>
<P>
The plan, which is scheduled to be submitted to the SEC by the
end of October, also spells out how the company's 2 billion U.S.
dollars debt will be restructured, and its schedule of payments.

<HEADLINE> Iranians Clash with Pakistani Embassy Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Violent clashes broke out
Wednesday morning between Iranian demonstrators demanding the
release of their diplomats by the Afghan Taliban and staff members
of the Pakistani embassy here.
</P>
<P>
Violence occurred when the demontrators tried to break into the
embassy.
</P>
<P>
A reporter from the official news agency IRNA, Ablfazl Shaker,
tried to force his way into the embassy and ask Pakistani
diplomats to answer questions about Islamabad's support for the
Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani embassy staff dragged Shaker into the embassy when he
pushed open the main gate. The gate was shut immediately and
Shaker scuffled with the embassy staff while more demonstrators
tried to get into.
</P>
<P>
The glass of the gate was broken, and some Iranian
demonstrators accused that it was broken intentionally by
Pakistani embassy staff in order to worsen the situation.
</P>
<P>
In front of the main gate were about 100 people, mainly IRNA
staff members and relatives of the IRNA reporter Mahmoud Saremi
and 32 Iranian drivers, claimed to be captured by the Taliban in
northern Afghanistan Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 11 Iranian diplomats were also reportedly taken
captive by the Taliban forces who took over Mazar-e-Sharif, the
main stronghold of the opposition Northern Alliance. more

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Survey Informal Sector of Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Nigerian government is
expected to soon embark on a national survey of the informal
sector of the economy for better planning, a leading national
newspaper, This Day, reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The exercise would enable the government to document relevant
issues in the informal sector as they integrate or interfere with
national planning objectives, it said.
</P>
<P>
The informal sector, which is described to have been
responsible for the survival of the Nigerian economy, is made up
of al the parallel activities that complement the functions of
the official or formal sector.
</P>
<P>
It is in recognition of this fact that the Federal Office of
Statistics (FOS) is embarking on the survey of the informal
sector by September so as to have adequate information on it,
said FOS Director-General Oladejo Ajayi.
</P>
<P>
According to him, there is in most cases a parallel market to
every genuine market that exists. But the activities of the
informal sector are not recorded and so cannot be measured or
regulated.
</P>
<P>
It has been widely believed that non-official business
activities worth billions of Naira are executed annually at
border areas but the money is not recorded because there are
people who do not use the bank as a means of saving money.
</P>
<P>
In this case, the government in its economic planning does not
have adequate knowledge of the prosperous border trade.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the balance of payment accounts and
all macro-economic indicators, which are part of the country's
international transactions, may not also be correct because most
Nigerians' international transactions do not come in through the
country's ports as a result of complications.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the total output of the Nigerian economy is given
by the sum of consumption, investment, net exports and imports.
</P>
<P>
However, in line with the FOS official's views that most
business activities have parallel ones, total consumption,
investment, net exports and imports can never be known, the total
output of the Nigerian economy cannot be determined correctly.

<HEADLINE> Swedish Stocks Down 3.09 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
STOCKHOLM, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Swedish stock prices plummeted
3.09 percent on Tuesday, following a worldwide trend.
</P>
<P>
In Sweden, service companies were the hardest hit, down by an
average of 4.17 percent. Banking and financial companies were also
affected, with a plunge of 4.15 percent.
</P>
<P>
In neighboring Finland, Helsinki stocks exchange finished the
day down by a dramatic 5.50 percent. Oslo slid by 3.50 percent,
while Copenhagen lost 3.77 percent.
</P>
<P>
Asian currency worries, the bleak mood on Wall Street and a 9
percent plunge in Russian shares were some of the negative factors
moving through European markets.
</P>
<P>
Driven by sell-offs by foreign investors, the downward slide
in Sweden may continue for some time, analysts said. But brokers
predicted that long-term prospects remain solid.
</P>
<P>
"We see the recent price adjustments as healthy and necessary,"
said Swedish Foreningssparbanken analyst Rodney Alven. He said
shares of banking and financial companies and manufacturing firms
look attractive at current low levels.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Economic Review: Floods Affect China's Economic Growth (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The flooding on China's Yangtze
River over the past two weeks has caused great losses of life and
property and economists say that it could lower this year's
economic growth rate by 0.5 percentage points and cause 200
billion yuan in losses.
</P>
<P>
Water levels in the river are still well above the warning line
and it will be another two weeks before they fall below it. The
total direct losses will surpass 200 billion yuan, economists predict.
</P>
<P>
There was flooding on the Yellow and Nenjiang rivers as well,
and by the beginning of August, 240 million people and 21.5
million ha of farmland had been affected.
</P>
<P>
Early rice yields were down, and autumn grain yields are
expected to be affected, according to Wang Yuexin, a State
Statistics Bureau official. However, he would not say by how much
since the flooding is not over.
</P>
<P>
A Ministry of Agriculture official says that it will be
difficult to reach this year's target of 490 billion kilograms of
grain and predicts a growth rate for agricultural value-added
products at around 3 percent, with the 4-percent goal difficult to
reach.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Buy 28 Military Choppers from U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish Navy has decided to
buy a total of 28 Sea Hawk helicopters from the United States
before 2010, Turkey's Daily News reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of eight helicopters made by the Sikorsky
Company worth 205 million U.S. dollars will be delivered by 2001,
senior Turkish defense sources, who declined to be named, were
quoted by the newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
An advance on the helicopters, accounting for 15 to 20 percent
of the total cost which has yet to be disclosed, was paid by
Turkey in June, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Sea Hawk choppers are armed with airborne survival
equipment, data and voice communication systems and advanced
weapons control systems.
</P>
<P>
But the Hellfire air-to-surface missiles, which are initially
part of the Sea Hawk, are not included in the deal and will be
discussed in separate negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkey is considering buying Sikorsky-made S-70
Black Hawk helicopters. But the number is unknown.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Export-Import Bank is expected to finance the Black
Hawk deal as proposed by the company.
</P>
<P>
Turkey itself can only meet 20 percent of its demand for
weapons and military equipment.

The floods also slowed industrial growth. Latest figures for
July show a growth rate of 7.6 percent, 0.3 percentage points
lower than in June. The State Statistics Bureau attributed the
slowdown partially to the floods and said that some firms have had
to be closed.
</P>
<P>
The effect was two-sided. The floods delayed some
infrastructure projects and weakened consumer spending in rural
areas, but the large-scale home rebuilding activity after the
floods is expected to stimulate consumer spending.
</P>
<P>
Signs indicate more spending on infrastructure in the second
half, and Xiang Huaicheng, Minister of Finance, told a conference
recently that the country will have "more active" policies to spur
the economy.
</P>
<P>
The floods also changed government opinion about construction
of flood-control facilities. The State Development Planning
Commission has decided recently to spend more in this area than the
previous increase of 1.7 billion yuan at the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
One economist told the "China Economic Times" recently that if
there is a new driving force for economic development, the floods
will be a good thing in a sense.

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker Calls for Setting Up Modernized Ocean Patrol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Du Bilan, a member of the
National People's Congress' Environmental and Resource Protection
Committee (ERPC), says that China needs a more efficient and
modernized ocean law-enforcement system, similar to the United
States Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
Du told a conference on the Marine Environment Protection Law
that China, with its 10,000 km of coastline and 3 million
sq.km. of sea, has serious marine pollution problems.
</P>
<P>
She said that, in 1984, another country was drilling illegally
in Chinese territorial waters, but that China failed to notice at
the time.
</P>
<P>
China did set up a Marine Environmental Law-enforcement Team in
1985, with branches in Qingdao, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, to
investigate cases of marine pollution. Customs, transportation,
and fishery officers also patrol the ocean.
</P>
<P>
Du says that lack of cooperation between these teams has
greatly effected law enforcement and their equipment also needs
modernization.

<P>
BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- China has emerged as the world's
seventh largest producer of printing ink, with an annual output of
74,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute the growth in production to the nation's
booming printing sector.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted by the State Bureau of Quality
and Technology Supervision revealed that major producers have
maintained stable quality, with a noticeable fall in quality
levels for smaller firms.
</P>
<P>
The survey indicated that the number of printing ink products
meeting quality standards grew by 2.9 percentage points when
compared to 1992.
</P>
<P>
The survey also revealed that all counterfeit printing ink
products failed to meet quality standards.
</P>
<P>
China has over 400 printing ink producers. The survey
showed that 80 percent of the 225 products manufactured by 35
enterprises reached quality standards.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Army Surrounds Palace to Disperse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Lesotho Army
surrounded King Letsie III's palace in Maseru Wednesday morning
in a bid to disperse protesters who have gathered there since
last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Opposition Basotho National Party President Evaristus
Sekhonyana said army chief Lieutenant-colonel Makhula Motakeng
had instructed the protesters to disperse in a radio broadcast
Tuesday evening, South African Press Association (SAPA) reported.
</P>
<P>
"Early on Wednesday morning the army began surrounding the
royal palace. Another tank, inside the palace, is facing toward
the gate in the direction of the crowd," Sekhonyana said.
</P>
<P>
He said opposition parties, who are protesting against the May
election which they claim was rigged in favor of the ruling
Lesotho Congress for Democracy, had asked South African Deputy
President Thabo Mbeki to give the assurance that the army would
not be introduced into the dispute.
</P>
<P>
"Mbeki told us that he hoped the army would not be used. We
are (exerting) political pressure on a political issue and I do
not understand why the army is being used."
</P>
<P>
Mbeki was in Lesotho Monday to broker a deal between
government and opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
An agreement on the establishment of a South African-sponsored
committee to probe opposition allegations seemed to have failed
to appease protesters, who are demanding an intervention of the
king.

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges Pakistan to Seek Release of Diplomats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Iran again called on Pakistan to
help seek the release of its 11 diplomats reportedly held by the
Afghan Taliban forces, the official news agency IRNA reported on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi told IRNA that
Islamabad had earlier assured Tehran the safety of its diplomats
in Mazari-e-Sharif before the Taliban stormed into the city.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taliban forces, believed to have been supported by
Pakistan, took captive Saturday the 11 Iranian diplomats and a
correspondent after their conquer of Mazari-e-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
The fall of the city, the main stronghold of the opposition
Northern Alliance, marked a major victory for the Taliban, which
has won control of most of Afghanistan and imposed a strict form
of Islamic rule.
</P>
<P>
Iran, which supports the opposition headed by President
Burhanuddin Rabbani, has repeatedly urged Pakistan to secure the
safety of its diplomats.
</P>
<P>
But the Pakistani embassy in Tehran said on Tuesday that
Islamabad "cannot be held responsible for developments in
Afghanistan and Pakistan has nothing whatsoever to do with the
internal developments in Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
The Taliban force issued a statement on Tuesday that it is not
holding any Iranians in Mazari-e-Sharif. The diplomats have fled
the Consulate General in the city when its militia arrived, it
added.
</P>
<P>
And the Taliban said the missing Iranians would not be
recognized as diplomats and they, if arrested, would be tried and
punished as agents of a hostile government.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said evidences and documents available indicated that
Taliban's claim that the Iranian Consulate General was empty when
its militia forced an entry "is a mere lie."
</P>
<P>
Iran's special envoy for Afghan affairs Alaeddin Boroujerdi
Tuesday rejected the Taliban's claim, terming it as violating
international laws and principles.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the Taliban can not shirk its responsibility
for the safety of the Iranian diplomats.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Senate Urged to Ratify Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Manila, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado
on Wednesday urged anew the ratification of the Visiting Forces
Agreement (VFA), saying the Philippines needs regular joint
military exercises with the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Do we need these exercises? I believe it is so," Mercado told
a forum held here.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the importance of the 48-year old
Philippine-U.S. Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT) signed by the two
countries in 1951.
</P>
<P>
The VFA, which was signed earlier this year by the two
countries, has yet to be ratified by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
The VFA will enable American and Filipino soldiers to test
their effectiveness in the event of war under the 1951 MDT,
Mercado said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will also give Philippine soldiers an opportunity
to familiarize new weapons used by the Americans.
</P>
<P>
Annual Philippine-U.S. military exercises held under the MDT
have been suspended since late 1996 after the Philippines began to
negotiate with the U.S. a new agreement on the status of visiting
foreign forces.
</P>
<P>
In the absence of the VFA, war games cannot be held in the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The Americans are asking the Philippine government to ratify
the VFA before their troops can conduct big military exercises.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Senate has been strongly opposed to the VFA,
which many senators said favors the U.S.

BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A Beijing court today convicted

Bureau, according to the verdict handed down by the Beijing No.1
Intermediate People's Court.
</P>
<P>
Kou Jianming, the defendant sentenced to four years'

Chen, Han and Zhou were exempted from criminal punishment for
performing meritorious services to atone for their crimes.
</P>
<P>
Kou was sentenced to prison and deprived of all political
rights for two years in accordance with China's Criminal Law.
</P>
<P>
The four Taiwan people carried out espionage activities
while ostensibly working for the "Civil Exchange Association of

<HEADLINE> China Hosts 30 Million Foreign Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A total of 30.18 million foreign
tourists visited China during the first six months of this year in
spite of the Asian financial crisis, up 13 percent on the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the China National Tourism
Administration (CNTA) show that Chine earned 5.96 billion US
dollars from international tourism during the period, up 8.81
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial crisis lowered the consumption capacity of
people in related countries and resulted in an 8.11 percent
decline in the number of Asian tourists visiting China during the
first six months. The growing number of tourists from other
continents, however, has offset adverse influences, according to
CNTA officials.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the 15 major tourist markets, the number of
visitors from both Australia and Kazakhstan grew by over 20
percent, with a significant decline in the number of tourists from
Thailand, Malaysia and the Republic of Korea.
</P>
<P>
The number of tourists from Thailand fell by a hefty 34.16
percent, with slight drops in the number of arrivals from Japan
and the Philippines and various levels of growth in visitors from
other countries.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the number of Hong Kong and Macao compatriots
visiting inland areas grew by 16.19 percent, with the figure for
overseas Chinese growing by 21.53 percent. Tourism revenues for
tourists from the respective groups grew by 44.28 percent and 9.25
percent.
</P>
<P>
The number of Russian tourists fell by 5.72 percent in June,
with the first drop in over two years blamed on financial turmoil
in Russia.

CHANGSHA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The Beijing-Guangzhou Railway
Line, a trunk north-south line, has remained open during the
recent serious flooding on the Yangtze River thanks to help from
the People's Liberation Army (PLA).
</P>
<P>
The line has helped move a large amount of flood relief
materials and reinforcements to flood-hit areas in Hubei and Hunan
provinces. The eastern side of Dongting Lake in Hunan has been a

Premier Zhu Rongji made a special trip to the dike during the
flooding to urge PLA personnel and civilians to make every effort
to protect dikes and the line.

For more than 40 days, 7,000 soldiers have been working to
protect the dike and have stopped problems in more than 100
places, shipping 200,000 bags of sand, fortifying 4 km of dikes,
and building walls, diversion ditches, and cofferdams.

<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Tuesday
that Israel will not object to the U.N.-sponsored talks on a
treaty banning the production of material used to make nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu added that Israel still has "fundamental
problems" with the proposed treaty and joining the talks "does
not imply adoption of a position on the agreement or its
contents."
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Shortly before the attack on the U.S. embassy in Kenya
occurred, a man in contact with Israeli intelligence warned the
United States that the embassy might be the target of a bombing,
but Israeli intelligence told the Americans not to put much faith
in the man's report.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the issue, Netanyahu's spokesman Aviv Bushinsky
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Netanyahu told the cabinet on Tuesday that the defense
budget for 1999 will be increased in light of the growing threats
against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said three areas of government activity must be
made priorities in next year's budget: strengthening defense,
investing in infrastructure, and bringing about renewed economic

WELLINGTON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Deputy Prime
Minister and Treasurer Winston Peters plans a national tour to
relaunch a "Buy New Zealand-Made" campaign in the country.
</P>
<P>
If the price and quality are right, "then we owe it to
ourselves and our fellow New Zealanders to buy New Zealand-made
goods," an Auckland-based newspaper Wednesday quoted Peters as
saying in his recent trip to Dunedin, a city on New Zealand's
South Island.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Herald also quoted the deputy prime minister as
saying "We should not fall into the trap of thinking imported
items are better simply because they are foreign."
</P>
<P>
New Zealanders should be proud about wearing and using New
Zealand-made products, Peters said.
</P>
<P>
"We should be vigilant and question why an imported item is
used in preference to something made here by our fellow countrymen
and women.
</P>
<P>
"There is nothing unhealthy about investing in our patriotism.
It is one further form of savings in the nation," he said.
</P>
<P>
Peters said that he thinks "there is a role for a wise
government in supporting exporters in business."
</P>
<P>
"It is not about picking winners but rewarding winners in a
sound export-based economy," he stressed.

<P>
LUSAKA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A highly-destructive pest is
threatening to wipe out as much as 80 percent of harvested grain
in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
The larger grain borer has struck all parts of Zambia and the
pest is spreading fast.
</P>
<P>
A warning against the bug has been issued by Zambia's National
Pest Containment and Control Program. It is appealing to farmers
to take urgent measures to control the bug by using pesticide,
The Post reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The larger grain borer was not known in Zambia until 1995 when
its presence is recorded in the Northern Province, which borders
Tanzania, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the destructive bug has moved to other provinces
in Zambia through imported maize from Tanzania to offset a
shortfall brought about by drought three years ago.
</P>
<P>
The seeds were distributed across Zambia by non-governmental
organizations as relief food.

<HEADLINE> Problem for Chinese Universities (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Lu Jiaming, a teacher from
Shanghai International Studies University, was far more than
surprised when he unfolded the files of a group of students.
</P>
<P>
Lu, who came to Beijing to enroll freshmen for his university,
found that these candidates are all females who passed this year's
university entrance examinations.
</P>
<P>
He wrote a letter to the Beijing Municipal Enrollment Office,
asking to reduce the number of students his university had
originally planned to recruit.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that to solely enroll female students is really an
embarrassment to him and his university. An excess of female
students has already created many problems in university
management, he said, and for the growth of female students
themselves.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that a survey has shown that male students only account
for 32 percent of the university's total, and there are only "a
few" male students in some specialties, causing problems in
teaching and management.
</P>
<P>
This also is a problem for Beijing Foreign Studies
University. At present, male students only account for 25 percent
of its total enrollment. Among the university's newly recruited
112 students, only 25 are males.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Youth Daily, female graduates from
some foreign studies universities usually feel nervous when they
meet with males in business talks, because they have few chances
to talk with males while they are in university.

<HEADLINE> Problem for Chinese Universities (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In some foreign studies universities, students have to "borrow"
male students to hold dances, and it is usually a headache for
university authorities to arrange dormitories for such a small
number of male students. These universities also miss the chance
to take part in team sports, because they do not have enough male
students.
</P>
<P>
The same problem also exists in some arts universities. A
teacher from People's University, who asked to remain anonymous,
said that female students accounted for 46.2 percent of the
university's total freshmen in 1996, 48.1 percent in 1997 and the
rate is expected to exceed 50 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, only 687 out of the 2,657 students who have passed
the bottom enrollment marks set by local institutes of arts are
males.
</P>
<P>
A female university president, who also wished not to be named,
said that, apart from the fact that females are having more and
more chances to go to school, the basic reason for their increase
as university students lies in the school education and
examinations.
</P>
<P>
She added that choosing students solely according to marks and
examinations based on memory is favorable to female students.
</P>
<P>
Many teachers attributed the change in enrollment to the
education system based examinations. They said such an education
system is actually a way to eliminate male students, who are
active in thinking and have broader interests.
</P>
<P>
An expert said that the essence of the question is not whether
female students are good or not in studying, but the key is that
the increase in the number of female students has reflected
shortcomings in teaching methods and ways for choosing talented
people.

<HEADLINE> More Ocean Environment Protection Needed: Lawmaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) - Zou Jiahua, the vice-chairman of
the National People's Congress Standing Committee, says that the
government needs to do more to protect the ocean environment from
severe pollution.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese legislature sent teams to Hainan, Liaoning and
Shandong provinces in May and June of this year to see how the law
was working there, and local legislatures in 8 other coastal
provinces and cities have been ordered to check the situation in
areas under their jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
The ocean environment is becoming more contaminated and the
situation in offshore areas is especially worrisome and is
deteriorating, Zou said after receiving reports from the
inspection teams.
</P>
<P>
China has 18,000 km of coastline and 3 million sq.km. of ocean,
which is useful for sustained growth, Zou said, and officials
should do better exploring and protecting it. Over 70 percent of
China's coastal waters are polluted and below national standards.
</P>
<P>
From 1980 to 1997, there were 280 red tides in China's
territorial waters. The government needs to increase control of
major coastal projects, offshore oil exploration, dumping of
waste, and drainage, and close factories that threaten the ocean
environment, in accordance with the law, Zou said.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Village and township
enterprises in south China's Guangdong Province witnessed robust
development in the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that the industrial output value for
related firms totaled 328.5 billion yuan during the period, a
year-on-year rise of 11.86 percent, with pretax profits rising by
8.47 percent to 15.69 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Private firms also enjoyed impressive progress and outstripped
the performance of collective enterprises during the first six
months, with the sector's total output value growing by 15.17
percent, value-added by 12.52 percent and business turnover by
15.49 percent.
</P>
<P>
Pan Jiayu, director of the Guangdong Rural Enterprise Bureau,
attributed the private sector's performance to preferential
policies introduced by the local government.
</P>
<P>
Statistics also show that rural enterprises enjoyed a 12.2
percent rise in exports to end the period at 72.53 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The notable achievement has been attributed to increased
exports to the UNITED STATES, Europe and Africa at a time when the
traditional markets in southeast Asia remain sluggish due to the
ongoing financial crisis, according to Pan.
</P>
<P>
The figures also revealed dampened efficiency with the
production-sales ratio dropping by two percentage points to 90.54
percent.

<HEADLINE> Lead Pollution in Dhaka Highest in World: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- The level of lead pollution in air
in Dhaka city during November to January is the highest in the
world, the national news agency BSS reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The lead pollution in the air reaches its highest level of 463
nanograms (one nanogram is one billionth of a gram) per cubic
meter in the city during the dry season during November to
January, the news agency quoted a recent study of the Bangladesh
Atomic Energy Commission as saying.
</P>
<P>
The Mexico city was previously considered as the city with the
highest level of air pollution where the level of concentration of
lead is 383 nanograms per cubic meter, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The use of petrol containing lead is primarily responsible for
lead pollution in the air of Dhaka city, which threatens public
health.
</P>
<P>
The lead particles spreading in the air with the petrol smoke
are so fine that the upper part of human respiratory organs is not
capable of preventing them from being inhaled into the body, a
senior scientific officer of the commission said.
</P>
<P>
Then they enter into the lungs, mix up with blood during its
circulation, and accumulate in the teeth and bones of the human
body. At a certain stage, the deposited lead causes serious damage
to the human body, the scientific officer said.
</P>
<P>
The lead concentration in Dhaka's air varies according to
season, from 463 nanograms per cubic meter to 160 nanograms per
cubic meter during the monsoon season, the report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Kosovo ethnic Albanian
militants Tuesday continued to attack Serbian police posts along
the highway between Decani and Djakovica, killing five policemen
and injuring six others in three days.
</P>
<P>
But the rebels were driven back to the mountainous area of
Junik, the Tanjug news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The attacks were designed to help hundreds of armed ethnic
Albanians to break out of the siege in Junik by Yugoslav troops.
</P>
<P>
The ethnic Albanian militants were routed by Yugoslav security
forces in Orahovac and Malissevo two weeks ago and fled to Junik
near the border area in an attempt to cross into Albania.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian Interior Ministry was reported to have discovered
in Malissevo files about Kosovo Liberation Army men including
their pictures and videotapes, the news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Ministry officials said that it would track down the armed
militants and other accomplices according to the files they have
intercepted.
</P>
<P>
In Kosovo, 52 policemen have been killed since January 1,

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Produce High Heat Duty Fire Clay Bricks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar will produce fire clay
bricks which can withstand over 1,250 degrees of heat for the
country's industries.
</P>
<P>
A fire clay brick factory of state-run Myanma Ceramic
Industries (MCI) was opened here Tuesday to produce 900 tons of
such high heat duty fire clay bricks annually, the official
newspaper New Light of Myanmar reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The factory, which cost over 3.55 million U.S. dollars, was
built in May 1997 to produce import substitute goods for
industries in the country to reduce foreign exchange expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar imported similar high heat duty fire clay bricks
annually for industries including cement plants.
</P>
<P>
The country's annual requirement of the bricks is over 1,200
tons for national industries including cement plants, steel mills,
 glassware, glass and ceramic factories and others.
</P>
<P>
At present, the country is producing low heat duty fire clay
bricks which can withstand up to 1,250 degrees of heat for saw
mills, rice mills, sugar mills, furnaces of small-scale steel
smelters and factory furnaces which transmit less heat.

<HEADLINE> India's Industrial Activity to Stay Sluggish in 1998-99 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 12 (Xinhua) -- India's industrial activity is
expected to remain sluggish during fiscal year 1998-99 (April 1
1998-March 31 1999) with no turnaround likely in the second
quarter because of high lending rates, said the National Council
for Applied Economic Research (NCAER), here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In its latest economic forecast, the independent think-tank
said that the economy, gripped by poor growth and low business
confidence, may not see a recovery in the second quarter too,
especially in the backdrop of economic sanctions imposed on India
by the United States following India's nuclear tests in mid May
this year.
</P>
<P>
High interest rates and probable rupee depreciation are
unlikely to allow upswing in credit and imports to continue and
that this would impede manufacturing activity.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the government's massive borrowing program would put
pressure on domestic financial resources leading to a rise in
interest rates and this coupled with higher cost of foreign loans
would hinder fresh investment, NCAER said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Facilitate Furniture Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is to set up a working
group to help boost the country's shrinking furniture export, a
government press release available Wednesday said.
</P>
<P>
The working group will revise and improve the rules,
regulations and measures which have been impediments to furniture
export.
</P>
<P>
The press release quoted the Commerce Ministry as saying that
the rules and regulations concerned, the measures regulated by
government agencies, the financial liquidity, information and
public relations have been major obstacles of Thai furniture
export.
</P>
<P>
According to the press release, Thai furniture export has been
decreased continuously from 1995 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
The value of Thai furniture export was 755.3 million U.S.
dollars in 1995, while in 1997 the value dropped to 725.7 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of 1998, the total export was only
288.3 million dollars, down 20.9 percent from the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
The decrease in Thai furniture export can partly be attributed
to the sluggishness of the Japanese market, which has been reduced
by 37.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The other two major markets for Thai furniture export are the
United States and the European Union.

BANGKOK, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Economic Ministers'
Council Meeting has approved a proposal of the Electricity
Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) to issue 300 million U.S.
dollar bonds in the international market, a government press
release available Wednesday said.
</P>
<P>
According to the press release, the World Bank will be the
bonds guarantor and an agreement with the World Bank will be
signed by Savit Bhotivihok, Minister to the Prime Minister's
Office, joined by heads of agencies concerned, namely the National
Economic and Social Development Board, the Finance Ministry, EGAT,
and the National Energy Policy Office.
</P>
<P>
However, the press release has not given the specific date of
the signing.
</P>
<P>
The EGAT's bonds issuance will help seek the financial sources
at a low cost for the construction of the power plants as earlier
approved by the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
However, in order to sustain the stability of financial status
of the EGAT as required by the World Bank's conditions, the
government has to consider increasing electricity price,
decreasing the amount of revenue which has to be forwarded to the
state, downsizing the EGAT's investment plan, increasing the
efficiency, or privatization.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Red Cross President
Bun Rany appealed Tuesday for help in fighting the dengue fever
epidemic sweeping Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
In a speech broadcast on Bayon Radio, the second prime
minister's wife announced plans to train hundreds of community
health educators to help prevent the spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
"Cambodian Red Cross wishes to appeal to all Cambodian people,
businessmen and international organizations to contribute towards the

</P>
<P>
The dengue epidemic sweeping Cambodia escalated recently. A
total 6,500 child cases have been reported this year, with 144
dead, according to statistics from the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
Dengue fever generally peaks during the rainy season because of
the enhanced breeding conditions provided by dampness. But an
unseasonably warm December gave rise to an early outbreak, the
results of which are now being seen in the scale of the wet-season
epidemic.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A trust fund of 16.4 million
Kyats (2.7 million U.S. dollars) has been set up at the Yangon
General Hospital here, the largest and the oldest one in Myanmar,
to buy expensive and potent medicines for poor patients.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the fund is a meritorious deed as it will
help save the lives of the poor, Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt,
first secretary of the Myanmar State Peace and Development
Council, was quoted on Wednesday by the official newspaper The New
Light of Myanmar as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government is spending nearly 3 billion Kyats (500 million
dollars) annually for the health sector, using separate funds for
health care services in border areas, disclosed Khin Nyunt, who is
also Chairman of the National Health Committee, at the fund
raising ceremony Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A cost-sharing health care system between the government and
the private sector has been introduced, he noted, pointing out
that Myanmar physicians, who are skilled practitioners, have the
ability to cure various diseases in the country, depending on the
availability of sufficient advanced equipment and potent
medicines.
</P>
<P>
The cost-sharing health care system, which was introduced
recently on account of the limited ability of the government to
bear all the national health expenditures alone, also called for
attending to the poor.
</P>
<P>
Up to March this year, there were 734 hospitals with more than
14,000 doctors in Myanmar, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar has worked out a five-year national health plan for
1996-2001 which includes six broad programs and 50 detailed

<HEADLINE> La Nina Important Cause of China's Flooding, Scientist Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A member of the Chinese Academy
of Sciences, Chao Jiping, says that El Nino's opposite, La Nina,
has been a major cause of south China's floods.
</P>
<P>
Chao said that subtropical high pressure systems generally move
northward to north China in July with considerable strength, which
would end the flood season in the Yangtze River Valley.
</P>
<P>
"However, the appearance of the La Nina phenomenon has weakened
the strength of the subtropical high pressure and forced the main
body of the pressure to move southward to 18 degrees north
latitude from its position at 30 degrees north latitude on July
10."
</P>
<P>
Chao said that under such a condition, with the help of the
ample water vapor coming from the south, south China's Yangtze
River Valley and Dongting and Poyang lakes suffered another heavy
rains this year, which have caused serious floods.
</P>
<P>
Historical records show that the background of this year's
floods in the country is surprisingly similar with that in 1954
when serious flooding occurred.
</P>
<P>
An El Nino weather phenomena appeared in 1953 followed by a La
Nina in 1954. This year's La Nina also followed last year's El
Nino, which was the strongest this century.
</P>
<P>
"The strength of the La Nina this time seems no less than that
of the El Nino in 1997," Chao said.
</P>
<P>
The La Nina phenomenon, the opposite of El Nino, means
colder-than-normal surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, and
greatly affects global weather patterns.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's exports in the first
half of the year plunged 4.1 percent in dollar term due to
sluggish demand in Asia, a government press release obtained
Wednesday said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's exports in the first six months were worth 26.93
billion U.S. dollars, down 4.1 percent compared to the same period
last year, while import value fell sharply to 21.43 billion, or
38.1 percent, resulting in a trade surplus of 5.49 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Among the major export markets of Thailand, the United States
increased 13.3 percent, the European Union 12.1 percent, Africa
28.5 percent and Australia 8.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, major markets in Asia recorded a sharp decrease,
with South Korea plunging 43.9 percent, followed by ASEAN
countries, down 22.5 percent, and Japan 16.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Export items increasing in value are rice, canned sea food,
computer, electronic products, automobile and parts and rubber
products.
</P>
<P>
Main imported products, namely fuel, capital, raw materials,
consumer products, automobiles and others, all recorded sharp
plunges of more than 30 percent, with automobiles even dropped 89
percent.
</P>
<P>
Thailand had been ambitious to achieve a 7.1 percent increase
in exports at the beginning of this year but had to lower the
target to 1 to 2 percent later since the baht's devaluation did
not boost exports as the government expected.
</P>
<P>
Experts even said the country's exports in this year will be
down two percent.

<HEADLINE> Arrival of Soldiers to Mend Dike Puts Residents at Ease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JIUJIANG, August 12 (Xinhua) -- While thousands of soldiers are
working hard to plug a breach in the city embankment on the
Yangtze River in Jiujiang, a city in Jiangxi Province, local
residents say they are no longer anxious and worried about their
future.
</P>
<P>
Residents of this east China city were scared in the first
hours after the dike burst at 1:30 p.m. on Aug. 7, but they said
calm prevailed shortly afterward because of timely and effective
help from the local government and the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
"I was cutting a birthday cake for my 9-year-old son when I
heard people fleeing for their lives in the streets," said Pan
Jingping, 35, who works at a local dairy.
</P>
<P>
Pan brought her son hurriedly to the New Spring Primary School,
a temporary shelter for more than 70 flood victims, from their
houses several hundred meters from the breached dike.
</P>
<P>
Pan returned to her house at 7 p.m., six hours after the
breach, to move furniture to upper floors. "Once I was worried if
my things could be stolen in my absence, but later I felt at ease
because police were patroling the area," she said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Shenghua, in her 30s, arrived at the school two days
after the breach occurred. She heard someone calling people to
flee. "I didn't want to leave my house, because I wanted to keep
an eye on my fish ponds," she said.
</P>
<P>
But she asked neighbors to bicycle her 89-year-old
mother-in-law, Chen Jinbao, and two children to the primary school
which is an hour's walk from the breached dike.
</P>
<P>
Zhang's husband, a transient laborer in another city, forced
her to leave home, but her father-in-law refused to go with them
and stayed on the third floor.
</P>
<P>
"There is no danger in my house," she said, adding that the
water was only a half-meter deep there.
</P>
<P>
Cao Guohua, 45, a handicapped tailor, said she was worried
during the first days of the breach. "But after I heard that
soldiers had been sent to repair the dike, I'm no longer worried,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
Cao continues her business at her house in the daytime and
sleeps at the primary school.
</P>
<P>
The school provides meals to those who did not bring cooking
utensils. "The local government says we will be financed later,
but for the time-being, we have to manage it by ourselves," said
Cao Yuxia, the schoolmaster.
</P>
<P>
In the downtown streets, brisk businesses are going on
everywhere, with prices a little higher than normal. "It is
understandable as we now have more people than ever in our city,"
said a local resident.
</P>
<P>
Tens of thousands of civilians and soldiers from other parts of
the country have rushed to the rescue these days. Many of them are
volunteers.
</P>
<P>
Food prices jumped on the first day of the breached dike, with
inflation ranging from 50 percent to 120 percent. They began to
fall on the second day. "There are plenty of supplies of food and
vegetables, so the prices cannot go up too much," said Wang
Fangqun, who works at a vegetable shop.
</P>
<P>
Business is quite good for Qi Longxing, a taxi driver. "My son
is preparing for marriage, therefore I must work hard," he
said. Many of his fares came from journalists, tourists and others
who came to help mend the breach.
</P>
<P>
Many local residents have voluntarily sent food and drinks to
soldiers and civilians who are working on the dike. In addition to
the breached dike, two secondary dikes have been built to protect
water plants and power stations as well as the downtown.
</P>
<P>
"Everything here is normal," said a local journalist, "and you
can see it from the booming restaurant business and so many people
are strolling in the streets.
</P>
<P>
"But the only luxury goods are boats, since a large number of
people are working on the breached dike or visiting those working
on it."

billion U.S. dollars, down 4.1 percent compared to the same period
last year, while import value fell sharply to 21.43 billion, or
38.1 percent, resulting in a trade surplus of 5.49 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Among the major export markets of Thailand, the United States
increased 13.3 percent, the European Union 12.1 percent, Africa
28.5 percent and Australia 8.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, major markets in Asia recorded a sharp decrease,
with South Korea plunging 43.9 percent, followed by ASEAN
countries, down 22.5 percent, and Japan 16.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Export items increasing in value are rice, canned sea food,
computer, electronic products, automobile and parts and rubber
products.
</P>
<P>
Main imported products, namely fuel, capital, raw materials,
consumer products, automobiles and others, all recorded sharp
plunges of more than 30 percent, with automobiles even dropped 89
percent.
</P>
<P>
Thailand had been ambitious to achieve a 7.1 percent increase
in exports at the beginning of this year but had to lower the
target to 1 to 2 percent later since the baht's devaluation did
not boost exports as the government expected.
</P>
<P>
Experts even said the country's exports in this year will be
down two percent.

<HEADLINE> Higher Death Rate Blamed for Speed Limit Hikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The increase in highway
speed limits from 88 to 104 and 120 kilometers per hour in most of
U.S. states translates into an increase in higher death rate, said
a study released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Fatalities in California rose by 16 percent, including an
increase of 22 percent on 104 kph highways and 12 percent on those
highways with an increase to 162 kph, said the study done by the
August issue of the Annals of Emergency Medicine
</P>
<P>
A preliminary assessment indicated that states with the higher
speed limits experienced a 9-percent increase in interstate
fatalities, or 350 more deaths, than historical trends predicted,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
The National Maximum Speed limit (NMSL) enacted in the 1970s to
conserve oil by setting highway speed limits at 88 kph, was
overturned by new legislation at the end of 1995. Eleven states
quickly moved to increase their speed limits on certain highways,
21 gradually increased speed limits over a matter of months, and
19 states made no changes.
</P>
<P>
Those states that immediately increased their speed limit had
the most pronounced increase in traffic fatalities, while there
was no statistically meaningful increase in the other states,
concluded the report.

<HEADLINE> Oil Prices Fall Under 13 Dollars Per Barrel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Crude oil prices fell below
13 U.S. dollars a barrel Tuesday, the first time in seven weeks on
the New York Mercantile Exchange, reports here said.
</P>
<P>
September crude fell 29 cents to 12.76 dollars per barrel. The
price of heating oil was down 0.42 cents to 34.02 cents a gallon,
while the September price of unleaded gasoline dropped 0.64 cents
to 40.01 cents a gallon.
</P>
<P>
Market sources say the major reason behind the decrease is the
fear that demand from Asia will not rebound strongly enough to
alleviate the world's depressed oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The American Petroleum Institute reported that U.S. oil
supplies rose last week.

<HEADLINE> Italian Official Warns of Mafia Threat to Euro Finance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The Italian Mafia is planning to
take advantage of the new single European currency, the euro, to
launder money, threatening to cause havoc in the financial and
monetary system, Palermo Mayor Leoluca Orlando warned in the
German daily Die Welt on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The financial branch of organized crime inevitably operates
where it is the most convenient and its increasing mobility is
taking it to Germany where the movement of money is the fastest",
the mayor warned in the article.
</P>
<P>
Orlando said that his city, Palermo, has changed from the Mafia
capital to the anti-Mafia capital and was willing to offer its
experiences to prevent the change to the euro becoming "a gigantic
washing machine."
</P>
<P>
He said that German police and the judiciary seemed to have
understood the critical role which Palermo could play.
</P>
<P>
Orlando, also a member of the European Parliament, said he had
submitted four anti-Mafia law drafts to the parliament, and three
had already been approved.
</P>
<P>
"This law package is a fundamental weapon for fighting the
spread of Mafia racketeering and the criminals' designs on the
Euro," he said.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Upgrade Power Grid for More Power Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Beijing will conduct a massive
upgrade of its power grid to reduce the blackouts and short
circuits in Beijing's power supply, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The renovation will allow the city to supply 1.5 million
apartments with at least 6,000 kilowatts by the year 2000, said
Tang Songhan, a manager with the Beijing's Power Supply Co..
</P>
<P>
Tang said the new network will be able to handle increasing
power demands as more residents buy large appliances like air
conditioners, microwave ovens and vacuum cleaners, that use a lot
of electricity.
</P>
<P>
The municipal government, the utility, and consumers will share
the cost of rewiring buildings built prior to 1995.
</P>
<P>
Electricity has been in short supply in Beijing for the last
two decades. Blown fuses were a common occurrence.
</P>
<P>
Beijing's power shortage was relieved after a tow-year
upgrade started in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that Beijing has enough power to supply the city's
growing needs but the power grid still can not handle the added
current.
</P>
<P>
The electric utility company is working to attract more users
and sell more of its products, for industrial electrical demand
has dropped since many state-owned enterprises shrunk after
reforms started in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Currently, industry uses a little more than half of the total
electrical supply, down from 60 percent in the early 1990s.

<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian businessmen have suggested
the government create a technical commission to protect the
national textile industry against Asian imports.
</P>
<P>
Peru's textile and design sectors have been affected by a flood
of Asian products.
</P>
<P>
National Industry Society Chairman Eduardo Farah said Tuesday
that the commission should take measures to defend local industry
against unfair competition which was caused by Asian products.
</P>
<P>
He said that Peruvian products could not compete with goods
from some Asian countries where currencies have been devalued and
the sale prices were below production costs.
</P>
<P>
George Scholfield, chairman of the Textile Committee, said that
Colombia, Venezuela, Mexico, Chile, Argentina and Brazil were
going to increase tariffs by 100 to 200 percent on Asian products
in order to protect their own textile industries.
</P>
<P>
He said the imports of Asian goods in Peru amounted to 14
million U.S. dollars in the first quarter of this year, five
million dollars more than the same period last year.

<HEADLINE> La Niqa Important Cause of China's Flooding, Scientist Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 12 (Xinhua) -- A member of the Chinese Academy
of Sciences, Chao Jiping, says that El Niqo's opposite, La Niqa,
has been a major cause of south China's floods.
</P>
<P>
Chao said that subtropical high pressure systems generally move
northward to north China in July with considerable strength, which
would end the flood season in the Yangtze River Valley.
</P>
<P>
"However, the appearance of the La Niqa phenomenon has weakened
the strength of the subtropical high pressure and forced the main
body of the pressure to move southward to 18 degrees north
latitude from its position at 30 degrees north latitude on July
10."
</P>
<P>
Chao said that under such a condition, with the help of the
ample water vapor coming from the south, south China's Yangtze
River Valley and Dongting and Poyang lakes suffered another heavy
rains this year, which have caused serious floods.
</P>
<P>
Historical records show that the background of this year's
floods in the country is surprisingly similar to that in 1954
when serious flooding occurred.
</P>
<P>
An El Niqo weather phenomena appeared in 1953 followed by a La
Niqa in 1954. This year's La Niqa also followed last year's El
Niqo, which was the strongest this century.
</P>
<P>
"The strength of the La Niqa this time seems no less than that
of the El Niqo in 1997," Chao said.
</P>
<P>
The La Niqa phenomenon, the opposite of El Niqo, means
colder-than-normal surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean, and
greatly affects global weather patterns.

<HEADLINE> Jakarta Military Commander Vows to Secure Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Jakarta Military Commander Maj.
Gen. Djadja Suparman Monday night pledged to deploy thousands of
military personnel to help secure the capital ahead of next
Monday's celebration of the anniversary of Indonesia's
independence.
</P>
<P>
Suparman made the pledge in a meeting with representatives of
non-governmental organizations amid rumors of renewed mass
rioting.
</P>
<P>
"All personnel stationed in Jakarta will be involved. If the
city police chief asks us for support, we are ready," he was
quoted by the local press Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Suparman reiterated that he would cooperate closely with city
police chief Maj. Gen. Noegroho Djajoesman, who is in charge of
security in the city.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-five thousand military personnel and 17,000 police
officers are stationed in the capital.
</P>
<P>
Rumors have been circulating over the past few weeks that a
fresh wave of rioting would erupt a few days ahead of the August
17 celebrations.
</P>
<P>
Suparman called on the city's residents not to believe the
rumors, some of which have been spread on pamphlets.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the capital's security forces held a parade of 1,500
police and military personnel to help convince the public that
they were ready to handle any further outbreaks of unrest.
</P>
<P>
Suparman also urged certain parties not to mobilize the masses
or stage rallies that could lead to unrest. Those ignored the
request would face legal sanctions, he warned.
</P>
<P>
"We must uphold the law. The city police chief has made
repeated calls for this. Let's unite to pursue this," he added.

RIO DE JANEIRO, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Export of agricultural

</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Philippine Banks Freeze Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Banks in the Philippines have
decided to freeze lending and deposit rates for at least a week
despite the latest round of increases in overnight interest rates
by the country's central bank, a newspaper reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Deogracias Vistan, president of the Bankers Association of the
Philippines (BAP), was quoted by the Philippine Journal as telling
reporters that the banks would hold off such increases for at
least two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The central bank on Tuesday hiked anew its overnight borrowing
rate by another three percentage points, from the present 15
percent to 18 percent, in a matter of 24 hours in a bid to quell
speculation against the Philippine peso.
</P>
<P>
"For as long as the central bank limits the interest rate
increases to overnight rates only and the speculation (on the
peso) does not last indefinitely, or over two weeks, the banks
will not change their rates," Vistan was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Present bank lending rates are pegged to the 91-day Treasury
Bill rate of around 14.1 percent plus 1.5 percentage points up to
six percentage points as spread to cover relevant expenses,
according to Vistan.
</P>
<P>
But if the central bank changes its term interest rate, the BAP
will impose changes in both deposit and lending rates to reflect
the new equation, Vistan explained.
</P>
<P>
Deposit rates, especially time deposit rates, will have to be
adjusted appropriately if the above parameters no longer hold
because by then the banks will have to scramble to retain
customers through attractive deposit rates, Vistan said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Richina Pacific expected
significant sales growth from its Shanghai Richina Leather
subsidiary, Chief Executive Tony Caughey was quoted as saying here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to New Zealand Press Association (NZPA), after months
of negotiation, Richina's business partner, Shanghai Leather
Corporation, has handed over a 40 percent stake in the business in
return for Richina buying its plant for 2.5 million NZ dollars
(about 1.3 million U.S. dollars) and taking out a 29-year lease of
its land and buildings. As a result, the Shanghai Leather
Corporation will own the lease and hold a five percent
non-participating interest in the business.
</P>
<P>
NZPA quoted Caughey as saying that having achieved its first
pre-interest operating profits in May, in line with expectations,
the leather business was generating higher sales than last year.
</P>
<P>
Sales for the six months to June 30 were 18 million NZ dollars
(about 9.2 million U.S. dollars), compared with 3.9 million NZ
dollars (about two million US dollars) in the previous
corresponding period, and a new contract with a United States
retailer was expected to raise sale volumes "significantly",
Caughey said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has appointed Amodu
Shaibu to restart his coaching stint to head the national soccer
squad, soccer officials said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This was the second time for Shaibu to coach the national
squad after his first four-year stint was stopped in February
1997.
</P>
<P>
However, Shaibu will work with a foreign manager who will soon
be named as technical adviser, said Nigerian Football Association
spokesman Austin Mgbolo.
</P>
<P>
Mgbolo said Shaibu's return to the national team was part of
plans by the Olympic champions to rebuild after their World Cup
campaign ended in a 4-1 second round defeat by Denmark.
</P>
<P>
From 1994 to 1997, Shaibu, who resigned last week from South
African club Orlando Pirates, has coached Nigeria for seven
losses, one draw and two wins during his first spell of coach.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a three-member Nigerian team returned from Europe
to shortlist five Dutch coaches for the post of adviser.

<HEADLINE> 1,000-year-old Frescoes In World's Loftiest Ancient Kingdom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
discovered wall paintings dating back 1,000 years in a temple
belonging to the Guge Regime, the "Kingdom of Heaven", located
nearly 5,000 m. above the sea level in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
They say that the frescoes are the earliest ever found of the
regime that ruled the northwestern part of Tibet from the 10th to
the 17th century. The regime was Buddhist and known for its
exquisite wall paintings in a great number of grottos and the
Mtho-ldin Temple.
</P>
<P>
The earliest paintings were found in two pagodas at either end
of the Kharsa Hall, which are among the oldest structures in
Mtho-ldin.
</P>
<P>
An archaeological expedition found them earlier this year. The
scholars believe that the paintings are the earliest and
best-preserved ever found at Ngari, in western Tibet, although
they are not certain what they depict. They also found the remains
of Buddhist sutras in Tibetan, statues, bows and arrows, iron
armor, and building materials.
</P>
<P>
Ngari is where scholars discovered 21 grottos scattered across
a 3,000-sq.km. area in the Zanda Earth Forest. They say that this
is the largest group of caves ever found in the country.
</P>
<P>
At Zanda they also found cliff paintings describing the daily
life of early people there. The findings will contribute to the
study of Tibetan Buddhism, architecture, sculpture, painting, and
the history of Ngari, according to Gyal Yang, the head of the
regional Cultural Relics Administration, who says they plan to
excavate relics and maintain ancient buildings, using 7 million
yuan from the central and local governments.

<HEADLINE> Luxemburgo Becomes Brazil New Soccer Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Vanderley Luxemburgo was
given the tough job on Tuesday to coach the Brazilian national
soccer squad after the Sanba dancers failed to win the fifth
World Cup in France.
</P>
<P>
Luxemburgo, who twice coached his Brazilian club to league
titles, succeeds Mario Zagallo who was removed after Brazil lost
3-0 to France in the World Cup title game last month.
</P>
<P>
"I am very satisfied," Luxemburgo said, "To be part of the
national team is the objective of any soccer professional, be he
a coach or a player."
</P>
<P>
However, it is premature to discuss plans for the team until
personnel in the national soccer federation is set and
"priorities are established", he said.
</P>
<P>
Luxemburgo, 46, coach of first-place Corinthians, will
continue his job in the team until the end of the national
championships in December.
</P>
<P>
The first players for the new national team are expected to be
named in September.
</P>
<P>
Started his coaching career in 1983, Luxemburgo has coached 14
teams, including two in Saudi Arabia. He led Palmeiras to the
national championship in 1993 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
Being a lackluster player in his 11-year career from 1971 to
1982, Luxemburgo gained national attention in 1990 as coach of
Bragantino, an obscure team that won the Sao Paulo state
championship.
</P>
<P>
After coaching Flamengo in 1995, he returned to Palmeiras. He
coached Santos in 1997 and this year joined Corinthians.

planning to issue U.S. dollar or Euro debt securities worth 250
million U.S. dollars in the international market.

securities.
</P>
<P>
PLDT is confirming with the country's Securities and Exchange
Commission that it is exempted from registering and licensing its
float locally since it will be offered abroad.

<HEADLINE> Roundup:Afghan Taliban Claim More Gains on Battle Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, August 11 (Xinhua) -- As intense fighting continues
in war-ravaged Afghanistan, the Taliban militia claimed Tuesday
evening another strategic gain with the fall of Taloqan, capital
of Takhar province, to the Taliban forces.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban militia also claimed more military gains in other
provinces controlled by the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance.
</P>
<P>
After loosing its stronghold of the strategic northern Afghan
town, Mazar-i-Sharif, the fall of Taloqan is certainly another
major setback for the beleaguered Northern Alliance which groups
forces of former Afghan defense minister Ahmad Shah Masood,
Uzbek-ethnic warlord Rashid Dostum and Shiite Hezb-e Wahdat.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Wali Naeemi, a Taliban representative based in
Peshawar, capital of Pakistan's North West Frontier province, told
Xinhua Tuesday evening that the Taliban forces have captured 80
percent of the area of Takhar province including the provincial
capital of Taloqan.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that forces of the Northern Alliance have now fled
to adjoining Badakhshan province after the fall of Taloqan to the
Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
Naeemi also claimed that the Taliban fighters have also
captured Charakeen falling between Mazar-i-Sharif and central
Bamyan province, Taighan Shamand in Bamyan province, Talabarfag in
Baghlan province and Kohisafi in Kepisa province.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban forces captured the districts after negotiations
with local population and on their "wish", said the Taliban
representative, adding that majority of the rival forces left the
areas while some surrendered voluntarily to the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
"The Taliban do not want fighting any more, they want
settlement of disputes with leaders of the Northern Alliance
through negotiations with local authorities and residents," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban forces made a strategic gain on the Afghan battle
field last week when they captured Mazar-i-Sharif, headquarters of
the Northern Alliance, giving a worst blow to the opponents.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taliban's military gains have caused serious
concerns to the neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports the Tajikistan government, with the
help of 25,000 Russian troops stationed in the country, has beefed
up the security measures and started reinforcing its borders with
Afghanistan Tuesday to guard against any spill over of the turmoil
in northern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
In another related development, the Kazakhstan government said
that leaders of four former Soviet republics in central Asia are
considering joint action to guard against any Taliban incursion
into their territories.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iran, followed by Turkey, has already urged the
United Nations and Pakistan to contain the Taliban militia from
harming the civilians in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that with the fall of Mazar-i-Sharif, the
Taliban are now occupying almost 90 percent of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe the U.N., the Organization of Islamic
Countries and Afghan neighbors should all speed up their efforts
to find a framework for the solution of the Afghan issue as there
are fears that the conflict in Afghanistan may enter a more bloody
phase if concerted efforts are not made at this stage to bring the
warring factions to the negotiating table.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, August 11 (Xinhua) -- AS Roma coach Zemen on Tuesday was
summoned to a drug hearing chaired by the Italian Olympic
Committee for his allegations that a number of Italian soccer
players have used performance-enhancing drugs.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Zemen, a Czech native, told Espresso that he was
amazed by the quick muscular development of players and they used
"medicines", including Alessandro Del Piero and Gianluca Vialli.
</P>
<P>
Riccardo Agricola, head of Juventus' medical team, denied
administering steriods or other banned substances to his players .
</P>
<P>
"To use steriods would be counter productive in soccer," said
Agricola. "They could cause muscle problems and threaten the at
hletes' health."
</P>
<P>
The Turin club and Del Piero have said they would sue Zemen
for libel.
</P>
<P>
Vialli, a former player of Juventus and currently Chelsea's
player-coach in the English Premier League, called Zeman a
"terrorist trying to destabilize the soccer world."

<P>
WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- New Jersey's state Athletic
Control Board is expected to make a decision on whether to issue
a boxing license to former world heavyweight champion Mike Tyson
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Tyson will attend the meeting, according to his lawyer,
Anthony Fusco Jr. "He will definitely be there, " said Fusco.
"We're hopeful. We think we made a good presentation."
</P>
<P>
The board scheduled a public meeting for Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
Tyson hasn't fought since June 1997 after he bit the ears of
WBA heavyweight champion Evander Holyfield during a bout in Las
Vegas. Nevada officials revoked his boxing liense for one year.
</P>
<P>
During a hearing before regulators two weeks ago, Tyson lost
his temper and cursed after being grilled by state lawyers about
the Holyfield incident. Tyson said the incident will haunt him
for the rest of his life.
</P>
<P>
The board met last Thursday to discuss the matter. Senate
Democratic Leader Richard Codey said approving the license would
make New Jersey "the International Embarrassment State."

<HEADLINE> Celtic Bonus Row Resolved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Celtic have its bonus row
resolved after managing director Fergus McCann took 50,000 pounds
(81,590 U.S. dollars) from his players and donated to a
children's charity on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The players at Parkhead had been involved in a stand-off with
McCann over the amount he was willing to pay if they won the home
leg of their Champions' League qualifier with Croatia Zagreb on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Marc Rieper, Henrik Larsson and Jackie McNamara made their
feelings known by failing to turn up for a team photocall on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
But it then emerged that all the players were united in the
protest.
</P>
<P>
Club captain Tom Boyd said: "The course of events yesterday
were the culmination of many months of trying to resolve the
situation in an amicable way for both the players and the club.
</P>
<P>
"It appears that a solution was not possible, and therefore in
consultation with all the squad members, the three players took
this stance of non-cooperation."
</P>
<P>
McCann is sticking by his original bonus offer, but he said
the issue had now been settled after a 50,000 pound sum was
awarded to Yorkhill Hospital.
</P>
<P>
"I want to show the players what is important in life - some
people don't even have a salary or a life to look forward to,"
said McCann.
</P>
<P>
McCann has accused his players, many of whom earn more than
10,000 pounds per week, of trying to blackmail the club, which
had offered the biggest in bonus in its history.
</P>
<P>
"I have spoken to the players and they are not very happy
about what we've done," said McCann.
</P>
<P>
"But we felt it was appropriate action. They should get a
reality check. We have gone beyond our contractual obligations to
them with regard to bonuses, they have not fulfilled theirs.
</P>
<P>
"A bonus payment in not an entitlement. In football, there are
clubs who can be blackmailed, but Celtic is not one of them."
</P>
<P>
McCann said that he had spoken to other British club chairmen
over the last few days and said what Celtic are offering for one
tie is more than one English club has put on the table for winni
ng the UEFA Cup outright.
</P>
<P>
More than 60,000 fans will fill Parkhead on Wednesday hoping
that the row will not affect the performance of Jozef Venglos's
side.
</P>
<P>
Celtic, who won the European Cup in 1967, have reached the
continent's premier competietion for the first time in a decade
and the supporters are desperate to see their team reclaim their
place among the top bracket in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Venglos revealed that Scotland World Cup midfielder Craig
Burley could yet play, despite doubts over his fitness after
damaging knee ligaments in a friendly with Liverpool last
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Croatia Zagreb are confident they can succeed where they
failed last year when they lost to Newcastle at this stage on the
away goals rule. Striker Mark Viduka said: "The British style
suits us down to the ground. It is Celtic who should be quaking
in their boots."

<HEADLINE> Van Hooijdonk Put on Transfer List </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- English premier league club
Nottingham Forest have put Dutch striker Pierre van Hooijdonk
with a price of eight million pounds (about 13.05 million U.S.
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The 28-year-old international has been effectively on strike
in the Netherlands since returning from the World Cup after
claiming Forest had not bought enough quality players to survive
in the premier league following their promotion last season.
</P>
<P>
Forest football director Irving Scholar had flown to the Nether
lands on Monday to try to persuade Van Hooijdonk to stay at the
club for whom he scored 34 goals last season.
</P>
<P>
The Dutchman, who still has four years of his Forest contract
to run, joined the club in March 1997 for 4.5 million pounds
after falling out with Scottish champions Celtic.
</P>
<P>
"It saddens me greatly," said Forest manager Dave Bassett.
"But these days it is the players who hold all the cards."
</P>
<P>
Forest begin their premier league campaign at champions
Arsenal on Monday.

<HEADLINE> Drugs Checks May be Delayed by Lack of Funding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- England Football Association's
plan to step up random drug testing for soccer stars might be
delayed by a row over funding.
</P>
<P>
After Ron Atkinson revealed last weekend that drug abuse was
widespread in the game, Lancaster Gate announced plans to double
the number of tests they carry out at training grounds around the
country.
</P>
<P>
In a book entitled "A Different Ball Game", the former Arsenal
manager alleges that Premiership players take to the pitch every
weekend "with cocaine, cannabis and all sorts of funny tablets
buzzing around their system".
</P>
<P>
His claims have once again reopened the debate about drugs in
sport. That debate reached new heights this summer after doping
scandals involving athletics and cycling's Tour de France.
</P>
<P>
Despite statistics which show that the problem of drugs in
soccer is receding - only three tests in 500 turned out to be
positive last season - Atkinson's comments suggest the FA's
approach could be falling short of the mark.
</P>
<P>
FA officials disclosed their intention to widen the program
but the UK Sports Council's anti-doping unit, the organisation
responsible for the independent monitoring of drug testing, still
believes that the game lacks the commitment to get to grips with
the issue.
</P>
<P>
The recommendations are unlikely to be put in place until next
season after the UKSC told the FA that they would not help
finance the new procedures.
</P>
<P>
Michelle Verroken, director of ethics and anti-doping at the
UKSC, said: "Increasing the FA's program would mean an expansion
of the UKSC's responsibilities but we have not got any money to
cover that."
</P>
<P>
"Their plans can only be seen as a stepping stone and they are
going to have to look again at how they are approaching this," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The FA spend around 500,000 pounds (some 820,000 US dollars)
on its drug testing and education program of which 50,000 pounds
is provided by the UKSC. The new program will cost the FA an
extra 60,000 pounds a season.

<HEADLINE> Agassi Backs to Top 10 by Beating Kiefer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Andre Agassi of the United
States showed his determination and power to regain his former
world number one position by beating Nicolas Kiefer of Germany in
the 2.45 million U.S. dollars ATP Championship in Mason, Ohio of
the United States on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
He won four straight points to force a tiebreaker after
falling behind 30-0 in game 12 of the second set, then won
through over Kiefer 4-6, 7-6 (7-3), 6-2.
</P>
<P>
With the victory, Agassi climbed back in the top 10 of the
world rankings for the first time since January 1997.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think you show up to any tournament and play your
best tennis in the first round," Agassi said. "You've just got to
get through the days when you're not feeling the greatest."
</P>
<P>
The former world No. 1 player was ranked a distance No. 141 in
last November. "It's nice to feel competitive again," said
Agassi, who is currently ranked ninth in the world.
</P>
<P>
Kiefer, who is 25th in the ATP rankings, never had played
Agassi before. "It was a good chance to beat him. I played him
very aggressive. I see that I can beat him."
</P>
<P>
Two seeded players of the tournament were beaten today. Thomas
Muster of Austria beat 11th seed Tim Henman of Britain 6-4, 7-5,
and Wayne Ferreira of South Africa downed 15th seed Felix
Mantilla of Spain 7-6 (7-5), 7-5.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Musicians Popularize Folk Music </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, August 12 (Xinhua) -- Some Chinese musicians want to
develop folk music and make it more popular to protect the unusual
Chinese cultural heritage.
</P>
<P>
At a seminar on traditional Chinese music in the capital of
northeast China's Jilin Province they expressed a concern about
the possibility that there will be no people to follow folk music,
because of popular music and songs.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese have been producing their own music for 8,000 or
9,000 years. But now, in many cities, children learn to play
pianos and violins instead of traditional Chinese instruments.
</P>
<P>
Yang Shiju, an associate professor in the music department of
Northeast Teachers University, says that musicians should be
responsible for popularizing folk music and introducing more
people to folk music.
</P>
<P>
Some musicians say that more attention should be paid to the
quality of folk music and improving the variety of traditional
Chinese music.

LONDON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Wisla Krakow of Poland
celebrated their late escape from FIFA's threatened ban on all
Polish international soccer with a 5-1 victory over Trabzonsor of
Turkey in the first leg of their second qualifying round tie at
UEFA Cup on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tomasz Kowalik led the win with a hat-trick. Other two goals

respectively.
</P>
<P>
But there was disappointment in the capital as Polonia Warsaw
went down 1-0 to visiting Dynamo Moscow with the lone goal from
Rolan Gusiev at the 54th minute.
</P>
<P>
Former European champions Crvena Zvezda (Red Star Belgrade)

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- European stocks markets closed
sharply down Tuesday after Wall Street's afternoon slide, despite
news of the merger of BP and Amoco, two of the world's biggest oil
companies.
</P>
<P>
British shares slumped, triggering the second largest fall in
London's blue-chip share index since the stock market crash of
1987.
</P>
<P>
News of the world's biggest ever industrial merger between
energy giants British Petroleum and Amoco failed to cheer the
plunging market. The FTSE 100 index closed 154.8 points lower at a
seven-month low of 5,432.8.
</P>
<P>
A BBC report quoted Jeremy Batstone, head of research at
NatWest Stockbrokers, as describing the market "busy contemplating
suicide as it stared down the barrel of a gun."
</P>
<P>
"If it hadn't been for the BP and Amoco tie-up and its brief
soothing effect, the market would have fallen further," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier gains among a number of oil stocks were eroded in the
wake of profit-taking. Investors panicked at plummeting shares in
Japanese stocks amid fears that the Asian meltdown was far from
over, according to market analysts.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, the German market did not escape hefty losses on
Wall Street, closing almost 4 percent weaker.
</P>
<P>
Dealers talked about the prospect of the Dax testing the
psychologically and technically significant 5,000 points level
soon, as the floor-traded DAX index closed 3.80 percent weaker at
5,268.40 points, while the electronic Xetra DAX finished 3.2
percent lower at 5,285.78 points today.
</P>
<P>
Paris stocks ended down more than 2 percent after being
pummelled by what analysts called confusion over Indonesia's debt
repayment and Wall Street's fall on fears of currency devaluations
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The blue-chip Cac-40 index ended down 93.47 points, or 2.37
percent, at 3,845.98 but above its session low.
</P>
<P>
At one point, the index slumped to 3,786.19, its lowest level
since late April, but it steadied slightly later, and climbed back
above 3,800 before the close.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Banks Reject Employees' Condition of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan bank employers Tuesday
to abandon their seven-day strike and resume work following
Friday's bomb blast.
</P>
<P>
The 52-member Banks of the Kenya Bankers Association (KBA)
maintained that the employers' collective decision to sack the
striking employees was final.
</P>
<P>
The best the employers can do at this stage is to peruse
application letters from the sacked workers without any guarantee
of employment, said KBA Executive Officer Baphael Chubi.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Union of Commercial, Food and Allied Workers
(KUCFAW) said Monday that the strikers are ready to reconsider
industrial action, in view of Friday's bombing which killed at
least 224 people and injured nearly 5,000.
</P>
<P>
KUCFAW gave four conditions, which KBA rejected Tuesday "as
they (the striking workers) ceased to be our own."
</P>
<P>
"Our decision, unfortunate decision so to speak, still remains
intact and if they (the striking workers) want jobs, they are
free to reapply," said Chubi.
</P>
<P>
KUCFAW had wanted the employers to withdraw all the dismissal
letters already served on members. The union also wanted workers
to be allowed to resume work unconditionally and without
victimization.
</P>
<P>
It also asked the Kenyan government to give a firm commitment
to implementing the decision of the tripartite committee on the
contentious tax and the fringe benefits tax.
</P>
<P>
The fourth condition was that the employers should abandon the
requirement that the workers reapply for their jobs.
</P>
<P>
"It is not a bad decision, only that it comes when it is too
late to do anything other than allow them a chance for
reapplication," Chubi replyed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The bankers went on strike last Monday in protest against the
government's plan to tax interest-free or low-interest loans
available to bank staff.
</P>
<P>
They have since been dismissed en-masse by the bank employers,
under the umbrella KBA.
</P>
<P>
The headquarters of the Cooperative Bank of Kenya, which is
placed fourth in the Kenyan banking industry, was extensively
damaged in the bomb attack early Friday.

<HEADLINE> German Government, Opposition Squabble over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, August 11 (Xinhua) -- A government report about the
safety of nuclear energy production sparked a heated debate
between the German government and opposition parties on Tuesday
about whether it is necessary to shut down the country's nuclear
power plants.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear safety report presented by German Environmental
Minister Angela Merkel on Tuesday showed that Germany had
registered 2030 cases of technical defaults in nuclear power
plants over the past ten years.
</P>
<P>
Among those defaults, however, there were only two cases that
were of acute nature that need to be reported publicly immediately
and 51 cases belonging to the category of less serious technical
defaults that need to be reported within 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
Merkel told reporters in Bonn that the report showed that by
international standards, German nuclear power plants had an
"excellent safety level".
</P>
<P>
She also reiterated the government position that there was no
need for Germany to get rid of nuclear energy.
</P>
<P>
The main opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD), however, saw
in the government report a proof that great risks are involved in
the production of nuclear energy and that the possibility of a big
accident still cannot be ruled out.
</P>
<P>
The environmental speaker of the SPD, Michael Mueller,
suggested on Tuesday that Germany gradually shut down nuclear
power plants in about ten years.
</P>
<P>
Juergen Trittin, a leader of the German ecologist Greens party,
on Tuesday repeated his criticism of the government for a recent
nuclear scandal during which excessive contamination had been
found in a number of German nuclear waste shipments to a
reprocessing plant in France.
</P>
<P>
The Greens has been calling for a quit from nuclear energy as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting the opposition demand, Merkel noted that an important
reason for Germany to retain nuclear power plants was that Germany
could gain more experience in nuclear technology and then could
help enhance international safety standards.
</P>
<P>
There are now 19 nuclear power plants in operation in Germany
which produce about one third of the annual energy supply for the
country.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Hits 8-Year High Against yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar rose to an
eight-year high against the Japanese yen Tuesday as investors
continue to dump yen for safer currencies.
</P>
<P>
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 147.35
Japanese yen, up from 146.15 late Monday. During the day, the
dollar reached 147.61 yen, a level not seen since August 20, 1990,
when the dollar hit 147.96 yen.
</P>
<P>
The dollar also rose against the German mark. The Mexican
peso fell to a record low for the second consecutive day. Canada
again intervened in foreign exchange markets, hoping to halt
further devaluation of the Canadian dollar.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. currency was changing hands at 1.7797 German marks, up
from 1.7759.
</P>
<P>
Investors dumped yen and Japanese stocks after a government
agency downgraded its assessment of the country's economic
prospects. Japanese stocks fell for the seventh consecutive
session, losing 1.4 percent, kindling the selloffs that reached
the Dow Jones industrial average, which dropped 112 points.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Embassies Closed for Security Adjustments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
temporarily closed a half-dozen embassies for security adjustments
following last week's bombings at its embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania, a senior U.S. official said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We're not shutting embassies down in a permanent sense. We are
not leaving. We are taking, in effect, a brief timeout in order to
make security adjustments that are necessary to be responsive to a
threat," Assistant Secretary of State Patrick Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
The bombings at U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last
Friday have killed more than 200 people, including 12 Americans,
and wounded well over 5,000.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy said the State Department and its overseas posts have
received between one dozen and two dozen threats since the embassy
bombings.
</P>
<P>
Over the course of a year, there are about 31,000 threats of
varying sorts, and all are treated seriously and checked out,
Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
"We have always said to our chiefs of mission that they are
responsible to protect the lives and safety of personnel
overseas," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If the chief of mission feels that there is information
available to him or her that says, I must take a particular step,
including potentially briefly suspending operations, until
adjustments to security posture can be made, then we feel that
that is absolutely the right thing to do," he added.

providing socio-economic assistance," he said.
</P>
<P>
Prince Aga Khan did not reveal the details of the projects and
their values.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the foundation chose to help Mozambique
because southern Africa enjoys political and currency stability

complex of various institutions designed to improve the living
conditions and growth opportunities in some specific areas in the

<HEADLINE> Damage from Nairobi Bombing to Cost $500 M: Moi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, August 11 (Xinhua) -- Reconstruction work in the wake
of last Friday's bomb blast will cost more than 30 billion
Shillings (500 million U.S. Dollars), Kenyan President Daniel
arap Moi announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"It was a tremendous impact that has affected all sectors of
the economy," Moi said when touring the bombing site as rescuers
continued to dig through the rubble in hope of finding more
survivors after nearly 100 hours.
</P>
<P>
The explosion aimed at the U.S. embassy located in a very busy
commercial area in Nairobi has killed at least 224 people
including 12 Americans and injured nearly 5,000. Fifty-three
buildings nearby were damaged at different degrees.
</P>
<P>
Moi toured every day the bombing site, where a five-story
building collapsed completely. More bodies were feared to be
found as the survivor-searching work is coming to an end.
</P>
<P>
Moi said investigations to determine the mastermind are
underway and that Kenya was working closely with Tanzania on
several clues. He however did not confirm whether the Kenyan
police had made any arrests.
</P>
<P>
The attack was an act of terrorism which transcended
international borders, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moi also assured the international community that Kenya was
still a safe tourist destination despite the bomb blast.
</P>
<P>
An official from the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) said Tuesday they may issue some results from their
investigation later this week.
</P>
<P>
Both the Kenyan Criminal Investigation Department and the U.S.
FBI experts are intensifying their investigation of the bomb
raid. But it is believed that the probe will have to take months.
</P>
<P>
Several witnesses including a Kenyan guard at the U.S. embassy
have claimed that they saw a covered van, several Arab-looking
men and heard gunshots when a huge car bomb blew up.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said the United States is to set up a
fund to help Kenyan victims of the Nairobi bomb blast and their
families.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Urges Immediate Ceasefire in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
on Tuesday called for an immediate ceasefire in Kosovo as the
on-going fighting has had a devastating impact on the civilian
population there.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement read by August president Danilo Turk of
Slovenia, the council said the proposed ceasefire would enhance
the prospects for meaningful dialogue between the Kosovo Albanian
leadership and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia leading to a
final end to the violence in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
It urges the concerned parties to start the negotiation as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
"The issue of Kosovo can have no military solution and all
violence and acts of terrorism from whatever quarter are
unacceptable," said the 15-member council after discussing the
latest report on the matter by Secretary-General Kofi Annan.
</P>
<P>
The council also stressed the importance of the implementation
of the prohibitions imposed by the Resolution 1160 and expressed
concern over infiltration from outside of weapons and fighting
men.
</P>
<P>
The Resolution 1160 adopted by the council on March 31
prohibits U.N. members states from selling or supplying arms to
the FRY including Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo, with an area of over 10,000 square km and a population
of 2 million, is a province of the Serbian Republic of the FRY.
Ethnic Albanians, making up 90 percent of the population, have
demanded independence of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Rejecting the demand, the FRY insists that the question be
solved within the framework of the current constitution by
providing equal rights to all its inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
Annan's repot, the fourth since the conflict broke out in
February, said the situation was aggravated in July by the failure
of the FRY and the Albanian Kosovars to enter into serious
negotiations on the future status of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Increased heavy fighting between the FRY security forces and
the so-called Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) raised the numbers of
civilian and military casualties to their highest point while the
displaced Kosovars have totaled 200,000.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Urges More Peace Efforts for Middle East </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 11 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Nelson Mandela Tuesday called for more efforts to be made to
achieve peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"Our humble experience has shown that negotiated solutions can
be found even to the conflict that the world has come to regard
as insoluble," Mandela told a banquet in honor of visiting
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
"It has taught us that such solutions emerge when former
opponents reach out to find common ground," said Mandela in his
speech, text of which is available in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
The South African president said that not enough was being
done to this end.
</P>
<P>
"In this testing time, the people of Palestine, and of the
Middle East as a whole, and their leaders, need all the vision
and perseverance they have demonstrated in the past in the
pursuit of comprehensive and lasting peace along the path mapped
out by the Oslo Accords," said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
Mandela reaffirmed his government's support for the
Palestinians, saying his country was proud of being part of the
international consensus affirming the right of Palestine to
self-determination and statehood.
</P>
<P>
"We are committed to playing our humble part, within the
limits of our resources, to help ensure that Palestine assumes
its rightful position in the global arena," said Mandela.
</P>
<P>
South African Deputy President Thabo Mbeki Tuesday attacked
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's position on the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
After a courtesy call on Arafat, Mbeki said it was surprising
that Netanyahu had not accepted the United States' proposals
aimed at enhancing the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"It seems to us that all that Netanyahu is doing is to try to
buy time to implement his programs, rather than work for peace
for the whole Middle East region," Mbeki said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who arrived in South Africa at midnight Monday, held
talks with Mandela Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader is expected to visit Robben Island and
address a joint sitting of parliament Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Arkansas Boys Sentenced for Shootings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 11 (Xinhua) -- The two boys who gunned down
four schoolmates and a teacher and wounded ten others in an ambush
outside an Arkansas school in March were sentenced to the custody
of juvenile authorities, possibly until they turn 21, the
Associated Press reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell Johnson, who turned 14 on Tuesday, admitted taking
part in the attack that followed a fake fire alarm on March 24 at
Westside Middle School in Arkansas, and he issued an apology at
the sentencing.
</P>
<P>
Johnson and his friend, 12-year-old Andrew Golden, was
convicted on charges they shoot to death four schoolmates and a
teacher.
</P>
<P>
Both boys were charged with five counts of capital murder and
10 counts of battery and were guilty on all counts.
</P>
<P>
The judge added a proviso: that if the juvenile system releases
them before they turn 21, they must serve 90 days in jail -- the
maximum allowed by law under such a proviso -- and will be on
probation until they are 21, the report said.
</P>
<P>
A lawyer for Andrew Golden said the boy took part in the attack
but was insane at the time and not mentally competent to
understand today's hearing. But Juvenile Court Judge Ralph Wilson
Jr. rejected Golden's argument and found him guilty.
</P>
<P>
At the sentencing hearing, Andrew remained silent, but Mitchell
apologized for the pain he had caused.
</P>
<P>
"I am sorry," he told the courtroom. "I understand that it may
be impossible for some of you to forgive me. If I could go back
and change what happened on March 24, 1998, I would in a minute."
</P>
<P>
More than 100 of the victims' relatives and school staff
watched the boys' hearing, which was the equivalent of an adult
trial.

<HEADLINE> Lesotho Official Killed by Crowd: Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 11 (Xinhua) -- A Lesotho government
official who allegedly tried to flee capital Maseru was beaten
and stoned to death Tuesday by a crowd who had blocked the road
to the border, a spokeswoman for opposition parties said.
</P>
<P>
According to witnesses, the man driving a car without number
plates bore down on the group and opened fire on them, wounding
three people, South African Press Association (SAPA) quoted
Monica Mopedi as saying.
</P>
<P>
The crowd set on the vehicle, smashing its windows, and the
unidentified man was beaten and stoned to death.
</P>
<P>
Mopedi said that a military vehicle retrieved the man's body.
The three wounded were not in a serious condition, she said.
</P>
<P>
A number plate, bearing the government's "X" code, was found
in the vehicle.
</P>
<P>
Several government officials had earlier crossed the border
into South Africa, according to witnesses.
</P>
<P>
There were standoffs between government and opposition
supporters in Maseru Tuesday while a crowd outside the residence
of King Letsie III was approaching 2,000 in number by Tuesday
night, Mopedi said.
</P>
<P>
A military vehicle fitted with loudspeakers was cruising the
area, exhorting the crowd to disperse.
</P>
<P>
Lesotho security force members Tuesday had to position
themselves between groupings to prevent clashes at three
locations.
</P>
<P>
Protesters gathered at the king's palace, seeking his
intervention in the row about the May election results.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy (LCD) won 79 of 80
parliamentary seats in the election. But opposition parties
claimed that the election was rigged in favor of the LCD.
</P>
<P>
The protesters were not appeased by the appointment of a South
African-led committee to examine the validity of the polls,
fearing that counterfeit electoral documentation may be presented
to the committee, Mopedi said.
</P>
<P>
The committee, composed of experts from South Africa, Botswana
and Zimbabwe, would have two weeks to report its findings.
