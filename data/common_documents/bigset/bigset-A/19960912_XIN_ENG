<HEADLINE> China's CPPCC Chairman Meets Dutch Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE HAGUE, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese leader Li Ruihuan
told Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok today that the development of
Sino-Dutch friendship and cooperation is in line with the
fundamental interests of the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
Li, Chairman of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), said China attaches great importance to its
ties with the Netherlands and hopes the ties, which enjoy a sound
base and broad prospects, will be enhanced.
</P>
<P>
China is ready to maintain high-level exchanges and political
dialogue with the Netherlands to promote mutual understanding and
strengthen cooperation, said Li.
</P>
<P>
Li said China pays much attention to the role of the
Netherlands in international economic affairs and its rich
experience in agricultural and industrial production.
</P>
<P>
He said that in recent years, China has seen a rapid
development in its ties with the Netherlands, one of the first
western countries to establish diplomatic ties with the People's
Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade has developed rapidly, Li said, and growth
rates in trade volume were much higher than those between China
and other European Union countries in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch premier's successful visit to China in 1995 strongly
enhanced Sino-Dutch friendly relations and cooperation in various
fields, Li added.
</P>
<P>
On international issues, Li said that countries in the world
share similarities while also differing from each other. The
shared interests, wishes and common tasks have provided a basis
and conditions for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, differences in social systems, life styles and the
pace of development have diversified the world and made it
necessary to conduct exchanges, consultations and understanding,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Li said the realization of shared interests through seeking
common ground while reserving differences is a symbol of the
maturity of human beings in dealing with state-level relations,
and a major condition for the sustained progress of human society.
</P>
<P>
The biggest issue in today's world is still economic
development and people's lives and priorities should be given to
doing those things with shared understanding and interests, the
CPPCC chairman noted.
</P>
<P>
The world is developing, people are progressing, time is
passing by and the shared human benefits are increasing, Li said.
Many disputes and conflicts will doubtless be settled gradually.
</P>
<P>
Wim Kok said that Sino-Dutch relations are sound and the
Netherlands is prepared to make its own contribution to the
sustained growth of China's economy through expanding mutually
beneficial cooperation and bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that his country is especially
interested in furthering cooperation with China in ship-building,
the electricity industry, trade and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Li also held talks today with Dutch Minister of Foreign Trade
Anneck Van Dok on strengthening economic cooperation between the
two countries.

ATHENS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Two illegal Iraqi immigrants
were killed and two others were seriously injured trying to sneak
into Greece after stepping on an old land mine while trying to
cross the border from Turkey, police said today.
</P>
<P>
Police later identified the two dead Iraqis as Jiavit Jabbar
Subechi, 29, and Said Abdulrajah, 24, and the injured as Arfchin
Hanur, 26, and Bechruz Rashidi Kivi, 31.
</P>
<P>
The two injured men told police that the blast occurred around
midnight on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
They said that because of the darkness, they did not see the
sign on the barbed wire warning them of the minefield.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqis said they mistook the barbed wire as the
Greek-Turkish border.
</P>
<P>
Police said a total of 18 illegal immigrants have been killed
and 24 others injured so far in minefield explosions along the
Evros river, which marks the Greek-Turkish border.

<HEADLINE> Two Iranian Women Sentenced for Abortion operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Two women were sentenced to
six months' imprisonment and heavy fines for conducting abortion
operations in Tehran, a press report said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Persian evening daily Kayhan reported that the lawsuit
against the two women was filed by a former "patient" at the
Tehran Islamic Revolution Court.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the investigators found a number of
medical instruments, equipment and drugs for abortion operations in
one woman's house.
</P>
<P>
However, the report gave no identities of the two women. The
first woman, who carried out the operation, was sentenced to six
months' imprisonment and fined 25 million rials (about 6,100 U.S.
dollars) and her assistant was given six months of suspended
prison sentence and fined 20 million rials (about 4,900 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The sum of the fine is 61 times as much as the average pay for
government employees.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic law of Iran does not allow any abortion unless the
mother's life is in danger because of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
However, some women have to undertake abortion operation for
many reasons. Some source said that about 80,000 abortion
operations are performed in the country a year.
</P>
<P>
Since the abortion operation is forbidden and very dangerous
in Iran, the cost for the abortion is very high, at least 400
dollars for each operation.

<HEADLINE> US Raises Corn Crop But Lowers Soybeans Forecasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Department of
Agriculture today raised its corn harvest forecast today to 8.80
billion bushels (223.7 billion kg), up from last month, in view of
prospect for better corn yields in some major states.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the department lowered its soybean forecast to 2.27
billion bushels (61.78 billion kg), as poor growing weather
brought negative impact to crop growing. Despite this, this year's
harvest would still be the second-largest on record for the
country and supplies will be tight throughout the year, the
department said.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the department predicted 8.69 billion bushels (221
billion kg) of corn harvest this year.
</P>
<P>
The eased demand caused the department to lower its corn price
projection by 15 cents to three to 3.45 dollars a bushel this
marketing year.
</P>
<P>
About wheat, the department raised its supply estimate because
of higher forecast yields, especially in North Dakota and
Minnesota, and reduced exports. High prices and competition from
other countries would cut overseas sales.
</P>
<P>
Production of spring-planted wheat other than durum was put at
687 million bushels (18.7 billion kg), up 8 percent from last
month prediction and second only to the 1992 record of 758 million
bushels (20.6 kg). Spring wheat is about 20 percent of the
country's total wheat production.
</P>
<P>
Despite higher production in the United States and elsewhere,
world wheat supplies will be at their second-lowest level in more
than 35 years.
</P>
<P>
Cotton production was forecast at 17.9 million bales (8.6
billion pounds), down 4 percent from the forecast last month and
unchanged from a year ago.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Takes Control of Jalalabad, Afghanistan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PESHAWAR, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban Militia
has taken control of Jalalabad, the biggest city in eastern
Afghanistan, this evening after heavy fighting with thousands of
Afghan government troops.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said that three thousand Afghan
government soldiers were air-dropped into Jalalabad this morning
and they defeated the local forces which had defected to the
Taliban Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Then the Taliban forces launched an major attack on Jalalabad,
the capital of Afghan's Nangarhar province, from two directions.
</P>
<P>
Both sides used modern and heavy weapons against each other,
and government jets also bombed the city.
</P>
<P>
At around 6:00 p.m. (local time), the Taliban succeeded in
establishing its rule over the city and appointed Mullah Borjaan,
a leading Taliban fighter as the new Governor of Nangarhar.
</P>
<P>
The human and property losses could not be ascertained so far
as the situation there was not totally calm.
</P>
<P>
Now, the Taliban forces were advancing towards the Pakistani
border in an attempt to take control of the strategic national
highway from Pakistan to Jalalabad, but they met with the strong
resistance from local forces loyal to Afghan Prime Minister
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.
</P>
<P>
The sounds of firing could be heard at the Pakistani border.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the latest report said that all the UN staffs based
in Jalalabad had left the city and were on their way to the
Pakistani border, which is only 45 kilometers away from Jalalabad.
</P>
<P>
All Pakistani diplomats in Jalalabad had also withdrawn from
the city and arrived in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
All the shops and bazzars in Jalalabad were closed and the
local people who failed to escape were confined in their houses.

<HEADLINE> UK PM Speaks on Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major said today the adoption of the text of the Comprehensive
Test Ban Treaty finally made the end of the Cold War possible.
</P>
<P>
"I warmly welcome yesterday's decision by the U.N. General
Assembly, by an overwhelming majority, to adopt the treaty," said
Major in a statement released here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. General Assembly voted l58-3 to approve the treaty
Tuesday with the only opposition coming from India, Libya and
Bhutan.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said, "This is an historic achievement which
the end of the Cold War has been finally made possible."
</P>
<P>
Major also expressed the belief that such a treaty can make an
important contribution to preventing the proliferation of nuclear
weapons and promoting international security.
</P>
<P>
He said Britain would sign the treaty in New York later this
month, and was "putting in hand the steps which will be necessary
for British ratification."
</P>
<P>
But there was still vital work to do, and if the treaty would
be effective, it must command the full support of the whole
international community, Major added.

<HEADLINE> Governor of Afghanistan's Nangarhar Province Resigns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PESHAWAR, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The deposed Governor of
Afghanistan's Nangarhar province, Abdul Qadeer, announced here
today that he has resigned from his post in a bid to save
Jalalabad from bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
Qadeer, who fled Jalalabad and arrived in Peshawar, Pakistan,
last night after some of his colleagues defected to the Taliban
Militia, said, "I resigned as I didn't want to become a party to
fight for power."
</P>
<P>
The Taliban took control of Jalalabad, about 45 kilometers away
from the Pakistani border, this evening after fierce fighting with
thousands of Afghan government troops coming from Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban then appointed Mullah Borjaan, a leading Taliban
fighter, as the new Governor of Nangarhar.
</P>
<P>
Qadeer said that as a result of existing situation and
uncertainty, he decided to resign.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he noted that war is not the solution to the
long-term Afghan conflict.
</P>
<P>
He called for all Afghan factional leaders to sit together for
negotiation.
</P>
<P>
Qadeer, an active leader of Hezb-i-Islami (Khalis group),
became the Governor of Nangarhar after the fall of Najibullah
regime in Kabul in 1992.
</P>
<P>
He had maintained good relations with almost all the Afghan
factions until recently when his forces were locked in fighting
with the Taliban which advanced into his province.

French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said that
the people who fled Irbil and Sulaymaniyah are returning home,
where the situation was described by him as "calm."

site, is moving towards appeasement which we have urged from our
heart and towards restraint which we have called on all sides to
show," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He also described as positive the amnesty announced by leader
of the Kurdish Democratic Party Massud Barzani, as well as his
appeal for reintegration of followers of Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan leader Jalal Talabani into the Kurdish political life.
</P>
<P>
This announcement should be confirmed by the implementation of
France's "appeal for dialogue and a political solution," said
Rummelhardt.

<P>
CAIRO, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkey will not deploy forces
in northern Iraq though it will take security measures to prevent
infiltration into its territories by terrorist elements, Turkish
Ambassador to Egypt Yacar Yakic said here today.
</P>
<P>
Yakic made the remarks during a meeting with Arab League
Secretary General Esmat Abdul-Meguid.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Meguid said following the meeting that Yakic presented to
the Arab League a memo that denied any Turkish occupation of Iraqi
territories.
</P>
<P>
Yakic also stressed his country's keenness on improving
relations with Arab countries, the Arab League chief said.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Meguid underlined the importance of maintaining Iraq's
territorial integrity, noting that any attempt to partition Iraq
would be a disaster for the whole region.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League has expressed grave concern over Turkey's
intention to enforce a buffer zone along the border with Iraq to
guard against attacks by Kurdish rebels operating from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkey does not insist on establishing this zone if there is a
way to prevent infiltration of terrorist elements into Turkish
territories, Yakic said in the meeting with Abdul-Meguid.
</P>
<P>
Consultations are under way in Ankara with an Iraqi envoy to
settle the issue peacefully, the ambassador said.

Turkey had proposed holding quadripartite negotiations grouping
Iran, Syria, Iraq and Turkey for settling the Kurds' problem, but
Syria refused, Yakic said.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Dissatisfied with Comprehensive Test Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Egypt is dissatisfied with the
 Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) approved by the
U.N. General Assembly Tuesday, saying "it is loose and
inclusive," according to the Middle East News Agency (MENA).
</P>
<P>
MENA quoted Sayed al-Masri, assistant foreign minister for
international relations, as saying today that Egypt has made it
clear that there are some disadvantages in the treaty as it does
not ban all sorts of nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
Although Egypt is not satisfied with the treaty, it voted in
its favor as it is a step toward nuclear disarmament, he said.
</P>
<P>
The treaty only prohibits explosive tests while it does not
ban laboratory and simulator tests using computers, which means
that the five nuclear powers can still develop their nuclear
weapons through such advanced technology, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The senior foreign ministry official said the treaty approved
by the U.N. General Assembly was not linked to a definitive
program for full nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The CTBT was overwhelmingly endorsed Tuesday by the
U.N. General Assembly with 158 votes in favor and only three
votes against it.
</P>
<P>
India led the opposition to the treaty and was only supported
by Bhutan and Libya while Cuba, Lebanon, Mauritius, Syria and
Tanzania abstained.
</P>
<P>
The treaty does not take effect before 44 countries having
nuclear power reactors ratify the document. They include India
which vowed that it will never sign such a treaty.

<HEADLINE> Supporters of Rival Candidates Clash in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Only three days after
parliamentary elections winding up in south Lebanon, an armed
clash erupted today in the area between supporters of incumbent
House Speaker Nabih Berri and former House Speaker Kamel Assaad.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said that the clash took place in the town of
Jmijmi in the eastern sector of the south between members of
Berri's Shiite Amal movement and supporters of Assaad, who was
defeated in Sunday's elections in the constituency.
</P>
<P>
Five supporters of Assaad were wounded in the clash, and they
were hospitalized at Tibnin, Bint Jbail, the police said.
</P>
<P>
Policemen of the interior security forces rushed to the town
and detained a number of people.
</P>
<P>
A total of 131 candidates were competing for 23 seats in the
forth of a five-phased general election in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon's two major Shiite groups, the pro-Syrian Amal
movement and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, forged a
joint list of 21 candidates to run for the elections, narrowing
the chances of other candidates.
</P>
<P>
The Amal-Hezbollah coalition scored a complete victory by
gaining 21 seats, leaving other two seats to Bahia Hariri, sister
of Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, and Mustafa Saad, a Sunni
candidate backed by Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Partly due to the coalition, which was only mapped out after
Damascus intensified its mediation efforts between its two
allies, no serious incidents were registered during the polling,
a fact described by Interior Minister Michel Al-Murr as a "model"
for other constituencies.
</P>
<P>
Kamel Assaad, who served as house speaker for four times from
middle 1960s to early 1980s, obtained 42,160 votes in Sunday's
election while Berri won 155,890.
</P>
<P>
There were more than 520,000 voters in south Lebanon and the
turnout was officially put at 48.2 percent, the highest since the
general election started on August 18.
</P>
<P>
The victory has made Berri the most favored candidate for the
speakership in the upcoming half-Christian-half-Moslem house.
</P>
<P>
Berri did announced his intention to win the second term of his
mandate at a press conference in his residence on Monday, several
hours before the outcome of south Lebanon's elections was
officially announced.
</P>
<P>
All the 128 seats in the next parliament will find their
owners after the fifth and last round of election is concluded in
the Beqaa in eastern Lebanon, where the Amal and Hezbollah will
also stand in a coalition.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Minister of Culture
and Higher Education Michel Edde has underlined the urgent need
to take immediate measures to preserve historic monuments in
Beirut in view of the extensive reconstruction works.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a symposium here today on the preservation of
ancient buildings in Lebanon, particularly in Beirut, the
minister said he did not subscribe to a delay of the
reconstruction works in Lebanon, but was keen that such works
would not undermine the country's national heritage.
</P>
<P>
Safeguarding national heritage, he said, is the duty of the
state as it maintains and preserves the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
He said that the preservation of the nation's heritage should
not be at the expense of property owners who ought to be properly
compensated.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that a special facility has been established
within the new structural framework of the Department of
Antiquities to deal with the issue of Lebanese national heritage.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has a history of 6,000 years, leaving behind numerous
antiquities and monuments throughout the country. Nowadays,
Beirut has become something of workshop and several of the
ancient buildings are facing the danger of demolition and
sabotage.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Egypt will decide whether to
hold a regional economic summit in Cairo and how and when to hold
it, Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said today.
</P>
<P>
The decision will be made in light of the current circumstances
in the region and the national, Arab and peace interests, Moussa
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"We are not talking about the cancellation of the conference
but rather about how, when and under what circumstances the
conference can be held," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Hosni Mubarak, Moussa and other Egyptian officials
have repeatedly linked the Middle East and North Africa Economic
Summit, scheduled to be held in Cairo on November 12-14, to the
Middle East peace process, saying that the conference can not be
held if there is no tangible progress in the peace march.
</P>
<P>
Osama el-Baz, Mubarak's top aide, said Tuesday that Egypt does
not want to cancel the conference but may postpone it till next
spring.
</P>
<P>
On Egypt's reservations over the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty
(CTBT) approved by the U.N. General Assembly Tuesday, Moussa said
that though the objective of the treaty is good, Egypt has
reservations over some items of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said that Israel's signing of the treaty is a good step
but it also has to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT).
</P>
<P>
The CTBT was overwhelmingly endorsed Tuesday by the
U.N. General Assembly with 158 votes in favor and only three votes
against it.

<HEADLINE> Iran Accuses US of Being Behind Iraq's Attack in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Iran's hardline Parliament
Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri today accused the United States of
being behind Iraq's attack on Kurdish regions in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Without U.S. support, Iraq could not have entered the
so-called Western designated 'safe havens' in northern Iraq,"
Nateq-Nouri was quoted by the official news agency IRNA as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian speaker expressed regret that certain people did
not accept the above-mentioned analysis apparently because of the
U.S. missile attacks on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the United States fired 44 cruise missiles at Iraqi
targets in southern Iraq and expanded the "no-fly" zone in
southern Iraq from the 32nd to the 33rd parallel.
</P>
<P>
Salah Noori Samarmad, charge d'affaires of the Iraqi Embassy
in Iran, denied U.S. support for his government, noting that "the
American forces fired missiles against the Iraqi targets." He
said that "Iranian accusation is not logical."
</P>
<P>
However, the Iranian speaker said that following the rapid
backing down of the United States, "our analysis on U.S. support
for Iraqi attack against the Kurdish cities proved to be true."
</P>
<P>
He said that by supporting Iraqi attack on Kurds, the United
States suppressed a group of its opponents and accordingly tried
to spread terror and panic in the region.
</P>
<P>
Washington's objectives in this new development, he said, was
an attempt to prevent spread of the Islamic revolutionary culture
 in the region.
</P>
<P>
On the streaming of hundreds of thousands of Iraqi Kurds
toward the Iranian border points, he said Iran has considered
giving help to the refugees as a humane and Islamic measure.
</P>
<P>
He concluded that the real aim of the United States is to try
to prevent the emergence of a strong government in Iraq.

CAIRO, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Guards at the Egyptian Museum
in downtown Cairo today foiled a man's attempt to steal some of
the priceless treasures of Egypt's famous young Pharaoh Tutan
Khamen.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Egyptian, identified as Omar Sabri Mohamed,
spent the night hiding under a showcase at the museum and broke
it, taking some 24 pieces and was planning to carry them out
during the visiting hours the next morning.
</P>
<P>
In the morning, the guards found the showcase broken and
decided immediately to close all doors and start a search for the
missing items.
</P>
<P>
The thief was arrested with a gold dagger, a bracelet, a bronze
cat and a scarab.
</P>
<P>
He also hid some other stolen pieces at toilets and was
planning to come back to collect them.
</P>
<P>
The pieces were put back on display and security measures were
tightened at the museum.
</P>
<P>
Tutan Khamen's tomb was discovered in 1922 by British
archaeologist Howard Carter. It took workers 10 years to clear the
priceless antiquities from the tomb in the Valley of the Kings,
outside the southern Egyptian city of Luxor.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Confirms Iraq Fires at US Planes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Iraq had fired two
missiles at U.S. fighter planes patroling the skies in northern
Iraq and "violated" a U.S. unilaterally-expanded no-fly zone in
the southern part of the country, causing the United States to
examine closely its military options, the Pentagon said today.
</P>
<P>
The missiles were launched at 3:55 a.m. EDT (0755 GMT) from an
SA-6 surface-to-air missile system near the town of Girpahn about
50 miles from the Turkey border at two U.S. F-16 fighting falcons.
</P>
<P>
Radar from the SA-6 illuminated the U.S. F-16s "for only a
couple of seconds" and the missiles missed the planes by a wide
berth, a Pentagon spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
As the radar only locked onto the U.S. aircraft briefly, the
aircraft did not have time to engage a counter missile system
called HARM that could have returned fire at the site.
</P>
<P>
The Pentagon dispatched a pair of F-15E Strike Eagle electronic
warfare planes to the region to take out the SAM site but they
failed to locate it, spokesman Navy Lt Cmdr. Scott Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
In southern Iraq, an Iraqi helicopter and a MIG-25 fighter
plane flew briefly below the 33rd parallel into the newly expanded
no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
The United States has said it would shoot down any Iraqi
aircraft that entered the zone, but no U.S. aircraft were in the
area at the time of the incident, Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi aircraft were spotted by electronic military gear
being used to monitor the new no-fly zone, expanded unilaterally a
week ago by the United States when it launched two cruise missile
strikes against Iraq for its troops entering the Kurdish enclave
in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration quietly weighed its options today
and has vowed for the past week to repeat missile strikes on Iraq
if it constitutes a threat to U.S.-led allied patroling planes.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime
Minister Frederick Sumaye has asked banks in Tanzania to go to
rural areas to finance agricultural and crop marketing
activities, instead of concentrating on traders in major
urban centres.
</P>
<P>
Officially opening the Trust Bank (Tanzania) Limited here on
Tuesday, Sumaye said that since Tanzania's economy was
predominantly rural, it was curcial for banks to give necessry
support.
</P>
<P>
He cautioned commercial banks that rushing to urban centres to
reap profits after financing economic activities of trading
nature was not a sustainable approach.
</P>
<P>
''As far as profitability is concerned, this area (urban
centres) is more lucrative, but not sustainable profitable.
</P>
<P>
''In an agriculturally based economy it will be suicidal for
banks to neglect the rural based economic activities which are
basically agricultural activities.
</P>
<P>
''If you avoid the rural sector in Tanzania you will be
guaranteeing yourselves of your own bank's demise because it can
not run for a long time profitably'', the premier explained.
</P>
<P>
The Trust Bank was established in Kenya in 1988. It opened its
doors to the public in Tanzania on March 1, last year.

Diego," said an official. Two B-52s were used in last week's
strikes on Iraqi air defense sites.
</P>
<P>
The move was taken after Iraq fired two missiles at U.S.
fighter planes patrolling the skies in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Radar from the SA-6 illuminated the U.S. F-16s for a couple of
seconds and the missiles missed the planes by a wide berth, a
Pentagon spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Because the radar only locked onto the U.S. aircraft briefly,
the planes did not have time to engage a counter missile system
called HARM that could have returned fire at the site.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has warned that the United States
will assert a right to protect its ability to keep Saddam's air
force grounded, and anything Saddam tries will be detected.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges States to Fight Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton on Wednesday proposed legislation that would require
states to drug-test prisoners and parolees in order to qualify for
federal money earmarked for building prisons.
</P>
<P>
During a speech at the Pueblo County Courthouse, Colorado,
Clinton who is in the midst of a three-day campaign trip, also
said the Justice Department was announcing 27-million-dollar in
grants for states to help pay for drug testing and intervention
programs for prisoners and parolees, according to news reports.
</P>
<P>
In the second of four states Clinton plans to visit during his
trip that began Tuesday, Clinton focused on his anti-drug message.
</P>
<P>
His scripted anti-drug initiatives have come under fire from
Republican Presidential nominee Robert Dole who claims the
administration is responsible for an increase in the use of
illegal narcotics by teenagers.
</P>
<P>
"Drugs don't belong in prisons or in the hands of parolees.
Parole is not a license to break the law, use drugs, and slip back
into crime; it is a chance to go straight and live a better life,"
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"So today I propose to offer legislation that will say to every
state in the country, 'We are prepared to continue to use funds
from our crime bill to help you build your prisons, but if you
want that money, you now must start drug-testing prisoners and
parolees to break the cycle of crime and drugs,'" he said.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans quickly fired off a statement urging Clinton to
not play politics with the drug problem.
</P>
<P>
"The president has failed in his responsibility to wage a real
war on drugs. In just three years, he has managed to undo 12 years
of success in turning back the tide of illegal drugs. Despite Bill
Clinton's rhetoric, Congress realizes it's time we fight the war
on drugs from the front lines again," said Representative Scott
McInnis, a Republican of Colorado.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who twice visited Pueblo during his campaign four
years ago and once as president, won Colorado with 40.1 percent of
the vote in 1992, compared to George Bush's 35.9 percent and
Perot's 23.3 percent.

</P>
<P>
A communique issued at the end of the three-day regular

movement of people between the two countries in a bid to
establish closer economic and social integration and agreed to
set up a joint technical committee composed of relevant
institutions of both countries which will submit a concrete
proposal within three months.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa to Investigate de Klerk Holiday Home Donation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 11 (Xinhua) -- An anonymous donation of
"several hundreds of thousands of Rand" for former South African
president F W de Klerk is to be comprehensively investigated, local
reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The donation is said to be used to secure an exclusive holiday
home in a nature reserve on the South Cape Coast for de Klerk.
</P>
<P>
Several years ago, an anonymous donor gave several hundred
thousand Rand to the then Cape provincial administration on
condition that the house be at de Klerk's disposal for life, and
that it be used for environment education when he no longer
wanted it, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
The anonymous donation was facilitated by former
postmaster-general Louis Rive.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk was reported to have agreed to the arrangement at the
time on condition that he not be told the donor's identity, that
it be limited to the period he was in public office, and that
Cape nature conservation be entitled to let the property to the
public.
</P>
<P>
At the moment de Klerk's free use of the property is limited
to 30 days a year.

<HEADLINE> UN Seeks 28 Million Dollars in Aid for Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations is
seeking 28 million U.S. dollars for humanitarian assistance in
Sierra Leone to cover the period until February 1997.
</P>
<P>
The updated consolidated inter-agency appeal for Sierra Leone,
launched today, reflects the recent positive developments in the
country following elections and the constitution of a civilian
government.
</P>
<P>
Last March, the United Nations had called for a total of 57
million U.S. dollars to meet the needs of approximately 1.6
million internally displaced people.
</P>
<P>
The humanitarian program has been modified to meet the
peacetime demands for emergency relief, and the projects covered
in the original appeal have been maintained, revised or deleted
according to current requirements.
</P>
<P>
Given those factors, as well as the contributions received to
date, there remains a shortfall of 28 million U.S. dollars to
meet the pressing needs of the war-affected Sierra Leoneans.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Favours Black Business in Tender-Granting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The South African
government has adopted some measures to favour black or female
owned businesses in winning state tenders from the government,
local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Pretoria, the State Tender Board said
Finance Minister Trevor Manuel had approved the introduction of a
point preference system aimed at helping historically
marginalised businesses compete favourably for state tenders.
</P>
<P>
The number of black, Indian, coloured and female co-owners of
a business could therefore become a decisive factor in
government's granting of tenders, said the board.
</P>
<P>
In terms of the system, price would count 88 points, company
equity owned by previously disadvantaged individuals 10 points,
and company equity owned by women two points.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the contract would be awarded to the tenderer which
scored the most points, but not the lowest bidder in price.
</P>
<P>
However, this system would only be applied to contracts worth
two million Rand (about 450,000 US Dollars) or less, said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Manuel also approved the introduction of an
''affirmative procurement'' policy within the Department of
Public works which awarded tenders for building and construction
services.

<HEADLINE> Bilateral Talks Between Uganda, Pakistan Held </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni and visiting Pakistani President Farooq Ahmed Khan
Leghari today opened bilateral talks here, during which they
agreed to promote cooperation between their countries.
</P>
<P>
In his remarks at the opening of the talks, President Museveni
said that he is pleased that the present government of Pakistan
has seen it fit to send a high-powered delegation to Uganda
during the visit of President Leghari who began a four-day
visit to Uganda on September 10.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said that this means the Pakistani leaders see value
in cooperation between Pakistan and Uganda in particular and with
Africa in general.
</P>
<P>
He said that there are many areas where the two
countries can cooperate such as trade, manpower development,
training and many others, adding that Pakistanis are welcome to
invest in Uganda for the mutual benefit of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, President Leghari said that all third
world countries must struggle together to gain their economic
freedom, adding that this will be possible if those countries
engage in South-to-South cooperation, especially in matters of
trade and industry.
</P>
<P>
Leghari reiterated that his country is not only aiming at
maintaining its relations with Uganda but also in enhancing
economic cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that Uganda and Pakistan should also work together not
only to heal the past but to look to the future with confidence
in order to strengthen their cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Israel to Start Talks on Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Jordan and Israel will soon
start talks on the annual export of 50 million cubic meters of
water by Israel to Jordan stipulated under the historic peace
treaty signed between the two countries in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian and Israeli teams will soon convene talks on the
issue, Jordanian Minister of Water and Irrigation Samir Kawar was
quoted by today's English-language daily Jordan Times as saying.
</P>
<P>
During his first official visit to Jordan in early August,
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged that his
government will initiate serious steps toward resolving the water
issue with Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Israel, which controls common water resources, has failed to
provide Jordan with an extra 50 million cubic meters of water this
year as outlined under the peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
However, Kawar said Wednesday in a statement to the Jordan News
Agency, Petra, that serious bilateral talks will soon help
implement the provisions of the peace treaty's supplements which
deal with water apportionment.
</P>
<P>
He said that as Israel and Jordan are activing the peace
agreements there is no foreseeable reason for Israel to object to
the construction of a dam on the Yarmouk River, which adjoins
borders of Jordan, Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
A joint Jordanian-Syrian panel met in Damascus Last month to
reiterate a 1987 commitment to build the dam on the Yarmouk River,
a branch of the Jordan River.
</P>
<P>
The dam was originally scheduled to be constructed in 1992, but
was postponed due to lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Syria were to have obtained funds from the World
Bank, but Israel's objections to the plan prevented the
implementation of the project, said Kawar.
</P>
<P>
"The Jordanian-Israeli peace treaty is in effect, Israel is
unlikely to object to the project," the minister added.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Israeli Agriculture and Environment Minister Rafael
Eitan criticized the Jordanian-Syrian project as a "violation of
the Jordanian-Israeli peace treaty."

<HEADLINE> "Spark Program" to go Westward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government is to
shift its emphasis on agricultural development by promoting
science and technology in its central and western regions.
</P>
<P>
The country will launch more so-called "Spark Program" projects
in next five years in the inland regions.
</P>
<P>
The Spark Program, initiated by the government, is China's
first plan to encourage economic development in rural areas with
the help of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Han Deqian, Vice-Minister of the State Commission for Science
and Technology, said at a news conference today that the westward
strategy is an important part of an outline action plan for the
Spark Program in the Ninth Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000),
which was issued today.
</P>
<P>
The efforts are to be made to speed up economic development in
the central and western parts of China, where the population
accounts for two-thirds of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
The official said that while promoting the technology and
regional economic development in China's relatively developed
eastern coastal areas, the government is to offer more support for
the country's central and western areas.
</P>
<P>
He explained that information, talents and technology are to be
introduced to those areas, to push forward the development of
rural enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Han said the rural population in central and western areas
accounts for two-thirds of the country's total, while the output
value of rural enterprises there is less than one-third of the
country's total, which has greatly hindered China's rural
development and even the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture is the basis for the national economy, and farmers
account for 80 percent of China's total population. Agriculture
has become the nation's top problem concerning China's economic
development and social stability, he said.
</P>
<P>
Introducing the newly issued Action Outline, Han said, by the
year 2000, China is expected to have a total of 300 regional
pillar industries in its rural areas, and establish 100
state-level technology-intensive zones, with science and
technology promotion projects launched in over 90 percent of
China's counties.
</P>
<P>
In the next five years, China is to aid the development of
planting, domestic animal breeding, agricultural chemical
industry, refined processing of farm produce, agricultural
equipment, light industry and textiles, rural building materials,
mining and other industries.

<P>
AMMAN, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul
Karim Kabariti met here today with Turkish ambassador to Jordan
Suha Umar who delivered a message from his government.
</P>
<P>
The message reiterated Turkey's respects for the Iraqi
sovereignty and territorial integrity, noting that the Turkish
security measures are aimed at maintaining its security and not at
violating Iraq's control over its own territory.
</P>
<P>
It noted that there will be no Turkish military bases on the
Iraqi territory.
</P>
<P>
The message said Ankara is willing to coordinate efforts to
prevent use of the Iraqi territory as a springboard for terrorist
actions against Turkey.
</P>
<P>
It stressed the Turkish government's keenness to develop
Jordanian-Turkish relations and the need for continued
consultation and coordination between the two countries on the
regional security.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has enjoyed good relationship with Jordan, who refused
to condemn the Turkish-Israeli military accord at the pan-Arab
summit held in Cairo in June following Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu took in power.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller planned to visit the
kingdom early this month, but postponed her scheduled visit due to
the beginning of the U.S. cruise missile attacks against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It is not immediately known when the visit will take place.

TOKYO, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto today pledged 3 million U.S. dollars in emergency aid to
help create employment in Palestine, the Kyodo News Service
reported.
</P>
<P>
The assistance is intended to create jobs for Palestinians by
promoting afforestation and infrastructure improvement projects in
areas around the second largest Palestinian city, Khan Yunis,
Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
At a 40-minute meeting with visiting Palestinian President
Yasser Arafat, Hashimoto also hoped that the Middle East peace
process would make substantial strides after last week's
ground-breaking meeting between Arafat and hard-line Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
However, Arafat, who is also leader of the Palestine Liberation
Organization, said no tangible progress had been made since the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
He added that mounting frustration among his compatriots could
be a destabilizing factor in the Middle East, Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who arrived here Tuesday on a three-day visit, has met
with Emperor Akihoto and Foreign Minister Yukihito Ikeda and other
senior officials. He will leave Tokyo later today.

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, September 12 (Xinhua) -- A Tang Dynasty empress has
become a "bridge" to encourage three provinces to join forces to
develop their historical resources.
</P>
<P>
Wu Zetian, wife of Emperor Gaozong, and later a ruler of the
Tang Dynasty (618-907 A.D.), was born in northwest China's Shaanxi
Province, and ruled the country from central China's Henan
Province. But the hometown of her family was north China's Shanxi
Province.
</P>
<P>
The three provinces, with the country's most cultural relics,
have co-operated to hold a large cultural relics show in Xi'an,
"Empress Wu Zetian and Women in the Tang Dynasty".
</P>
<P>
The show, which opened on September 6, is part of the
co-operation. On the same day the 'cultural-triangle' held a fair
featuring 1,000 copies of their rare cultural relics. They also
held a meeting to discuss further co-operation in developing
historical resources.
</P>
<P>
They have decided to hold a jade-ware exhibition, and open
several tourists routes, including one connecting seven cities in
the three provinces, which had been capital of ancient dynasties,
Kaifeng, Zhengzhou, Anyang, Luoyang, Xi'an, Taiyuan, and Datong.
</P>
<P>
Two of the country's most famous grottos, the Yungang Grottos
and Longmen Grottos, are included in the tourists routes.
</P>
<P>
The three provinces have also agreed to co-operate in
conserving cultural relics, large historical sites and ancient
buildings, publishing archaeological reports, and training museum
tour guides.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Afghan Political Scenario Changed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLALABAD, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The Taliban's capture of
Jalalabad in eastern Afghanistan this week has indicated a
tremendous boost for the student militia which had not got any
worthwhile successes in recent months.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban forces have reportedly taken complete control over
Jalalabad, the capital city of Nangarhar province, on Wednesday
after heavy fighting with thousands of Afghan government troops.
</P>
<P>
The significant victory for the Taliban will not only offset
its recent loss on the Kabul front-line, but also put great
pressure on the Kabul authorities as Taliban is now in control of
the strategic highway from Pakistani border to Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban's advance also changed eastern Afghanistan, which
had been called the "peace haven" in the war-torn state, into a
new battlefield.
</P>
<P>
Previously, a number of small parties headed by Nangarhar
Governor Abdul Qadeer pursued the policy of neutrality towards
those strong warring factions.
</P>
<P>
However, after the Taliban sent its major striking forces into
Nangarhar recently, Qadeer suddenly opted to join the government
forces against the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban routed troops loyal to Qadeer and overran the
strategic point of Hisarak in Nangarhar on Tuesday morning, which
resulted in the disintegration of Qadeer's ruling council.
</P>
<P>
Then, the defection of a major commander known as Mehmood to
the Taliban forced Qadeer to flee from Jalalabad and to take
refuge in Pakistan on Tuesday evening, leaving Jalalabad
leaderless.
</P>
<P>
Taking advantage of the sudden-changed situation, the Taliban
authorized Mehmood to establish its rule in Jalalabad and the
Taliban forces accelerated their advance towards the biggest city
in eastern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
But Mehmood's rule lasted for only one night as the Kabul
regime airlifted thousands of its troops to Jalalabad on Wednesday
morning with the help of Hazart Ali, a defected member of the
Nangarhar council to the Afghan government who was controlling the
Jalalabad airport.
</P>
<P>
Mehmood was killed together with his 70 soldiers when they were
on the way to Pakistani border after escaping from Jalalabad.
</P>
<P>
However, the government troops had little time to make defense
preparations before the Taliban launched a major offensive on
Jalalabad from two directions.
</P>
<P>
Both sides used heavy weapons in the fighting, causing
casualties and property losses which could not be calculated so
far.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban controlled the whole Jalalabad and the road leading
to the Pakistani border on Wednesday evening, giving a heavy blow
to the Afghan government.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here attributed the Taliban's success to its new
strategy of shifting major striking direction from Kabul
front-line to the relatively-weak eastern Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
Since Burhanuddin Rabbani's forces made reconciliation with
Hezb-i-Islami (Hekmatyar group) in May, the defense of Kabul has
been too strong to be broken.
</P>
<P>
However, the dramatic changes in eastern Afghanistan had an
obvious impact on the lingering Afghan peace process in three
aspects.
</P>
<P>
First, tens of thousands Afghan people are fleeing the battle
area and a new wave of refugees is in the offing.
</P>
<P>
Second, most of the UN organizations and foreign missions have
withdrawn from Jalalabad, weakening the international mediation
efforts among the various Afghan factions.
</P>
<P>
Third, the Afghan government has again accused Pakistan of
supporting the Taliban behind the scene, souring relations between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government, however, has firmly denied the
allegations by the Afghan government.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that a sound relationship between Islamabad and
Kabul not only benefits the two neighbors, but is also conducive
to the peace and stability in the region as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the latest offensive by the Taliban
forces has no doubt cast a shadow over the long-awaited peace
process, which has been showing a silver lining since May this
year. Afghanistan's troubles caused by the long-running civil war
are far from over.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Group Regrets U.S. Anti-Dumping Investigation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Electronics Industry
Development Association said today it regrets a U.S. decision to
continue anti-dumping investigations on imports of electronics
giant NEC and other Japanese supercomputer makers.
</P>
<P>
The decision by the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC)
is regrettable in view of changes in the supercomputer market and
technology in recent years, the association said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The anti-dumping probe by the U.S. Commerce Department was
triggered by a petition filed by leading U.S. supercomputer maker
Cray Research Inc. on July 29.
</P>
<P>
Cray claimed that vector supercomputers made by Japanese makers
including NEC, which won a U.S. federally-funded contract in May
for four supercomputers, are being dumped in the U.S., hurting the
domestic industry.
</P>
<P>
The ITC voted Wednesday to continuing the investigation,
affirming "a reasonable indication that a U.S. industry is
threatened with material injury by reason of imports of vector
supercomputers from Japan that are allegedly sold in the United
States at less than fair value."
</P>
<P>
The ITC decision is disadvantageous to both Japanese and U.S.
companies, the statement said.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States dispatched F-117 stealth fighters to
Kuwait and moved four B-52 bombers closer to the Middle East as
the American military prepared for an attack on Iraq that Pentagon
officials said would very likely be larger and more destructive
than a pair of American strikes last week.
</P>
<P>
-- Two of the Clinton administration's senior officials on
welfare policy resigned in protest of the law President Clinton
signed last month ending the Federal guarantee of cash assistance
to the nation's poorest children.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Facing lengthening odds, Robert J. Dole sought to reassure
the "faint-hearted people" in his own party with a pep rally on
Capitol Hill and a new series of ads designed to deliver a sharper
contrast with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. Navy and the Air Force have jockeyed strenuously
over which gets the anticipated assignment to attack Iraq from the
air in response to Iraq's reported rebuilding of air defense sites
and its launch of missile against U.S. F-16 jet fighters.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- A Federal Reserve survey of economic conditions around the
nation shows labor markets tightened and wages rose modestly, but
price increases were "notably absent" in late summer.
</P>
<P>
-- The U.S. found itself with few supportive allies in
attacking Iraqi air defenses recently with no bases in the Middle
East allowed to be used for that. Instead, it sent planes from
airstrips in Louisiana and Spokane, on a long flight over the
Pacific Ocean entailing a time-consuming top in Guam.

<HEADLINE> Minister: Iraq ready to Respond to New US Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Information Minister
Abdul-Ghani Abdul-Ghafoor has announced that his country is ready
to respond to any new U.S. aggression.
</P>
<P>
During a surprise visit to the Press Center of the Iraqi
Foreign Ministry today, Abdul-Ghafoor said, "Iraq brought to an
end the imaginary no-fly zones that the U.S. wants to maintain in
northern and southern Iraq. Our air defenses will deal with any
enemy object that violates the security and sovereignty of
Iraq."
</P>
<P>
"Northern Iraq is an indivisible part of Iraq. It is a fact that
has been well-known for 6,000 years," he said.
</P>
<P>
The "no-fly" zones north of parallel 36 and south of parallel
32 are restrictions imposed by the United States and have no
international legitimacy, Abdul-Ghafoor said, adding that nations
all over the world condemn the U.S. aggression on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi information minister said that if the U.S. commits a
new aggression on Iraq, its international isolation would become
greater, and Iraq would be entitled to defend its sovereignty and
airspace.
</P>
<P>
An atmosphere of cautious calmness is currently prevailing in
the Iraqi capital after the U.S. threatened to launch new missile
attacks on Iraqi targets.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the U.S. forces fire 44 missiles at Iraqi air
defense targets in southern Iraq and expanded the southern
"no-fly" zone from the 32 parallel to 33 parallel, reaching the
southern suburbs of the Iraqi capital of Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has announced that he would no
longer recognize the "no-fly" zones and ordered his forces to
shoot at any U.S. and allied aircraft the violate the Iraqi
airspace.

<HEADLINE> France Deeply Concerned About Rising Tensions in Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- France today expressed deep
concern over the return of tension in Iraq after an Iraqi attack
on two U.S. patrol planes over the northern area of the country on
Wednesday, sparking threats of retaliation from the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said France is
"deeply concerned by the heightened tension in Iraq" after an
Iraqi missile was fired at planes patrolling the no-fly zone.
</P>
<P>
He also called for consultation among the Western allies before
any response is made to the attack.
</P>
<P>
France, along with the U.S., Britain and Turkey, operates the
Provide Comfort air patrols over the northern part of Iraq. These
were created after the 1991 Gulf War to protect Kurds living in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
But France has maintained a clear distance with the United
States over its missile raids on Iraq last week and its latest
statement comes after Washington pledged a "disproportionate"
response to Wednesday's attack on its planes and sent more bomber
planes to neighboring Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has described the stationing of stealth bombers in Kuwait
as "an act of war" by the Gulf emirate, and vowed to resist any
large-scale U.S. reprisal.

<HEADLINE> Compromise Bill on Excise Tax Passed in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The House of Representatives
of the Philippines today passed a controversial bill,
restructuring the excise taxation on beer and cigarettes through a
shift from the ad valorem to the specific tax system.
</P>
<P>
The bill is a compromise version of an original bill that
sought to bring in 4.5 billion pesos (about 171.5 million US
dollars) of the nearly 14 billion pesos in increased annual
revenue that the government expects from an overall tax reform.
</P>
<P>
The remaining amount is expected to come from a broadening of
the tax base and a reduction of some tax incentives.
</P>
<P>
The increase in excise tax revenue will result from a change in
taxation method. Currently, the tax is based on a percentage of
the value of the production price of beer and cigarettes. The new
method will charge a specific peso amount per packet of cigarettes
and per liter of beer.
</P>
<P>
Speaker Jose de Venecia said that the passage of the bill ended
several months of "confused and confusing debates" on the proposal
to impose higher cigarette and beer taxes.

DAMASCUS, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister
Farez Boueiz arrived here at noon today for a brief visit to
Syria.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese foreign minister was welcomed at a Syria-Lebanese
border point by his Syrian counterpart Farouq al-Shara and a
number of senior Syrian Foreign Ministry officials.
</P>
<P>
According to reliable sources in the Syrian capital, the
Lebanese foreign minister will hold talks with his Syrian

international issues in general and the situation in northern Iraq
and the Middle East peace process on the Syrian and Lebanese
tracks in particular.
</P>
<P>
Syrian political analysts believe that the Lebanese foreign
minister's current visit to Syria is aimed at finding a formula to
counter Israel's "Lebanon First" proposal, which offers a
unilateral withdrawal of Israeli forces from south Lebanon in

<HEADLINE> Schlumberger to Expand Business in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Multi-national company
Schlumberger, a world industrial leader in oilfield services and
measurement and systems sectors, is planing to increase its
cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
Euan Baird, chairman, president and CEO of Schlumberger, told a
news conference in Beijing today about Schlumberger's investment
plans, which will mean an expansion of its business in China.
</P>
<P>
Asia's demand for oil is going up to 10 percent a year, with
China's growing demand accounting for a large slice.
</P>
<P>
This has encouraged Schlumberger to place its Asia's investment
focus in China. Half of business Schlumberger conducts in Asia is
in China, said Baird.
</P>
<P>
Schlumberger's total capital investment in China has already
reached 100 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
It has provided hi-tech oilfield services to China's oil
companies, as well as Shengli, Xinjiang, Sichuan, Tarim and Esso
Tarim land oilfields, and Bohai Sea and South China Sea offshore
oilfields.
</P>
<P>
The services include three-dimensional seismic surveys,
measurements-while-drilling, geology steering drilling,
logging-while-drilling, data management and information technology
and project management and well engineering.
</P>
<P>
Schlumberger will continue to deploy the latest technology to
help Chinese customers extract more oil and natural gas from
complex reservoirs.
</P>
<P>
It has three joint ventures in China, providing a wide range of
measurement systems, including component testers, smart cards and
terminals, electricity and gas meters.
</P>
<P>
Schlumberger is the first foreign company to set up a joint
smart card venture in China, in central China's Hunan Province.
</P>
<P>
It is working in cooperation with the People's Bank of China to
set up standards for smart cards embedded with integrated circuits.
</P>
<P>
With headquarters in Paris and New York, Schlumberger is
holding a training program in China for its employees
worldwide. Moreover, it is also expected to strengthen cooperation
with leading Chinese universities in research programs in a bid to
expand its business in the country.

KUALA LUMPUR, September 12 (Xinhua) -- A Singaporean student
was today sentenced to four months imprisonment and a fine of
10,000 ringgit (about 4,000 US dollars) by a magistrate's court in
Malaysia for possessing ecstasy pills.
</P>
<P>
The Singaporean, Yeo Kim Hoe, 21, was charged under Section 12
(2) of the Dangerous Drugs Act, which provides for imprisonment of
up to five years or a fine not exceeding 20,000 ringgit (about
8,000 US dollars), or both, Malaysian news agency Bernama
reported.
</P>
<P>
She was fortunate that the public prosecutor did not charge her
under Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act which carries the
mandatory death sentence on conviction.
</P>
<P>
Her defense counsel applied for a stay of the sentence pending
an appeal to the High Court and Magistrate Tay Lee Ly of Petaling
Jaya adjacent to the capital city agreed only to postpone the jail
sentence, Bernama said.
</P>
<P>
The Singaporean pleaded guilty before the magistrate to having
the hallucinatory pills at the departure lounge of the Kuala
Lumpur International Airport on May 16.
</P>
<P>
A total of 3,970 ecstasy pills weighing 241.4 grams were
discovered in several plastic bags on her when she was on her way
to Indonesia at the time of arrest.

<HEADLINE> Enterprises Urged to Accelerate Reforms and Development (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The reform of China's state
enterprises has entered into a crucial phase, and the drop in
enterprise economic efficiency has become a major problem in
China's current economic system, according to vice-premier Wu
Bangguo.
</P>
<P>
During a recent national meeting on economy and trade in
Tianjin, Wu pointed out that many state enterprises that were
losing money in the first four months of this year began to
recover in May with the steady rise of monthly profits.
</P>
<P>
The state industry, on the whole, has made up deficits and
increased surpluses, he said, but the struggling economic
situation of enterprises is still serious.
</P>
<P>
Wu, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC), said there are
many reasons for the current difficulties.
</P>
<P>
"However, the problems of enterprises themselves cannot be
neglected," he added.
</P>
<P>
Many of them have not yet really changed their ideas to
coincide with developments in China's rapidly growing economy, he
explained. With the stagnant operating mechanism that is currently
in place, irrational structures and poor technology and
management, they had trouble adapting to the transition from the
planned economy to a market economy, from the seller's market to
the buyer's market, and to fierce market competition in general,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Wu noted that the state enterprises have developed rapidly and
enhanced their strength since China's national reform and opening
wider to the outside world. They also have made huge contributions
to the national economic growth: 60 percent of the state's revenue
comes from state enterprises, which have employed about 70 percent
of urban residents, and other state organizations.

<P>
He noted that in the region, the economy of the Chinese
mainland is growing rapidly and he is sure that the linkage is
favorable to opening up the potential market in China.
</P>
<P>
Patrick Thompson, president of NYMEX, said that the important
link between his exchange with HKFE will provide the deep
liquidity so as to cater to growing client base in the region.
</P>
<P>

environment for future growth are readily apparent, stressing that
Hong Kong is uniquely positioned as a developed market in the
emerging economy of China.
</P>
<P>
According to the linkage plan, all products traded on NYMEX
ACESS will be available for trading in Hong Kong but the initial
focus of marketing efforts will be on gold, copper and crude oil
contacts.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Masters New Technology for Nuclear Power </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
CHONGQING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- China has mastered the
technology to manufacture major instruments used in nuclear power
plants, breaking the foreign monopoly in this field.
</P>
<P>
Design and manufacturing of the "EX" section of the nuclear
power process control instruments has been completed by Chongqing
Chuanyi Co. Ltd., one of the three largest producers of the meter
instruments in China.
</P>
<P>
The products were recently approved by a group of experts here.
</P>
<P>
The instruments are the "nerve center" of a nuclear island --
one of two major work sites at every nuclear power plant, the
experts explained. It must be highly precise, stable and reliable,
they added.
</P>
<P>
Few countries currently possess the advanced manufacturing
technology needed to make the instruments. Developed countries
prohibit the transfer of this technology to China.
</P>
<P>
The Chongqing Chuanyi Co. Ltd, which began to research the
technology in 1993, has made bold explorations into the
development of the automatic control systems and has introduced
new technological design methods.
</P>
<P>
The design not only meets the international technological
requirements of the 20 cabinets and 3,600 instruments in a nuclear
power plant, but also gained advantages over foreign manufacturers
in several technological areas, such as control functions,
precision and reliability of the system.
</P>
<P>
The new technology has paved the way for China's nuclear
products to enter the international market, company officials
said.

At a press conference held in the ancient Roman castle in
the Shiite stronghold of Baalbek city in the Beqaa valley,
Hussein Al-Husseini, a former house speaker, announced the names
of the candidates on the joint list.
</P>
<P>
The coalition was part of an agreement negotiated last week by
Berri, head of the moderate Amal, and Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah,
secretary general of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God,
under intensive mediation by Syria, the main power broker in
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Today's press conference had been scheduled for 10:00 a.m.
(07:00 GMT), but reporters had to wait for more than two
hours before the announcement was made.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources attributed the delay to Hezbollah's
persistence in a reduction of Prime Minister Rafik Hariri's
weight in the coalition by incorporating Al-Hussein Hassan
Al-Hojeiri to take the place of Ismail Sukkariya, allegedly an
"obedient servant" of Hariri.
</P>
<P>
The difference was ironed out at the last moment, with
efforts by Berri and interference by Damascus, according to
the anonymous sources.
</P>
<P>
Local political observers expect another landslide victory of
the Amal-Hezbollah coalition in the parliamentary elections in
the Beqaa, repeating a success the coalition achieved in southern
Lebanon last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 142 candidates are to compete in next Sunday's
elections for 23 parliamentary seats allocated for the
constituency, and the total number of eligible voters is 410,000.
</P>
<P>
At stake in the elections are eight seats reserved for
Shiite Moslems, five for Sunni Moslems, three for Greek
Catholic Christians, three for Maronites, two for Greek Orthodox
Christians, one for Druzes and one for Armenian Orthodox
Christians.
</P>
<P>
Six ministers, or one fifth of the 30-member cabinet of
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, are on the list.
</P>
<P>
Of the 23 seats contended for in the elections in southern
Lebanon last Sunday, 21 were won by the Amal-Hezbollah coalition,
including four Hezbollah candidates.
</P>
<P>
The other two seats were left to Bahia Hariri, sister of
Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, and Mustafa Saad, a Sunni
candidate backed by Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah has eight seats in the present parliament, whose
mandate expires in October.
</P>
<P>
Two incumbent deputies of the Iranian-backed party were
defeated respectively in the first round of the elections in Mount
Lebanon and in the third in Beirut.

<HEADLINE> IFC May Provide Funding For Shanxi Coke Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) may lend financial assistance to the
privately-run coke industry in north China's Shanxi Province,
according to the organization's chief representative in China.
</P>
<P>
"We are interested in providing financing for technical
renovations of Shanxi's privately-run coke industry," Davin
Mackenzie told Zhi Yulian, a Shanxi official attending an ongoing
investment and trade fair here.
</P>
<P>
A considerable part of coke in Shanxi is produced and exported
by private firms, Zhi said.
</P>
<P>
"But outdated equipment and technology have resulted in high
cost, low efficiency and heavy pollution," Zhi pointed out, adding
that technical renovations need foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
As IFC gives its investment priority to rural and township
enterprises with mature technology, stable markets and
standardized accounting modes, Zhi noted, the privately-run coke
industry in Shanxi fits the requirements in many aspects and "we
are confident" of cooperation with IFC.
</P>
<P>
Mackenzie said IFC is interested in funding the privately-run
coke industry in Shanxi, and he invited Shanxi officials and
private businessmen to hold further talks with IFC in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
IFC, which was established in 1956 as a member of the World
Bank Group, has invested a total of 900 million US dollars in
China since it became a member and shareholder of IFC in 1980. The
international financial body set up its China office in
1992.

<HEADLINE> ITEDSCC '96 Annual Meeting Opens in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- For the past three years,
China has annually invited 50,000 economics experts and more than
10,000 technical, cultural and educational experts from foreign
countries, while sending some 30,000 professionals in these fields
abroad to study.
</P>
<P>
From 1979 to the end of 1995, China had hosted a total of
490,000 foreign experts and sent 270,000 personnel overseas for
advanced training.
</P>
<P>
These figures were released from the 1996 annual meeting of the
International Talent Exchange and Development Study Conference of
China (ITEDSCC), which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day meeting, the more than 100-member executive
council will discuss the strategies of international talent
exchange and development in the 21st century, and also study and
formulate policies in these areas.
</P>
<P>
Lei Jieqiong, vice-chairperson of the Standing Committee of
National People's Congress and general consultant of ITEDSCC, and
other senior officials from the State Council were present at the
opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Lei said that since Deng Xiaoping issued the policy to make use
of foreign talent in 1983, China has made noticeable achievements
in the worldwide exchange. There are presently opportunities to
advance the work and also problems to be solved, she said.
</P>
<P>
She expressed the hope that participants at the meeting would
study new situations, and explore into ways and measures that are
in keeping with Deng Xiaoping's position on building socialism
with Chinese characteristics.
</P>
<P>
Ma Junru, director of the State Bureau of Foreign Experts
Affairs (SBFEA) and president of ITEDSCC, also spoke at the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
ITEDSCC was founded in December of 1989 as a nationwide
academic institute. It aims to study the present situation,
history and future of the international talent exchange and
development, so as to explore a more scientific process in its
work of inviting foreign experts and contribute to the country's
economic development and all-round progress of society.

<HEADLINE> Few Calls to HK Police Emergency Line Come Out Real </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Only 17 percent of the
nearly three million calls made to the Hong Kong police hotline
each year come out as real emergencies and an adoption of
Putonghua to the recorded 999 emergency messages would be delayed
until the handover next year.
</P>
<P>
Of the 294,536 incident reports in the first seven months this
year, only 50,641, about 17 percent of the total, were classified
by 320 police emergency line operators and communication officers
as emergencies.
</P>
<P>
The rest were mis-dials, nuisances, abandoned calls,
repetitions of the same case by several callers or incidents that
did not need police assistance.
</P>
<P>
Police had appealed to the public to call local police stations
for non-emergency cases so that real users will not be impeded.
</P>
<P>
Police came under fire recently when a ship's captain who could
speak only Putonghua tried to report that a crew member had
fallen overboard. He failed to get his message across because he
could not understand the recorded message and hang up. This
delayed the rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
The 20-second messages, which direct callers not to hang up and
to remain calm until an operator comes on the line, are recorded
in Cantonese and English.
</P>
<P>
Superintendent Peter Hunt of Hong Kong Island's Support Wing
said they had already shortened the message from 28 seconds to 20
and would not lengthen it again by adding Putonghua.
</P>
<P>
Police insisted that 80 percent of their operators spoke enough
Putonghua to handle emergency phone calls and said they would
continue language training.

<HEADLINE> Japanese-made Vehicles in HK Recalled for Faulty Brakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Japanese-made
minibuses operating in Hong Kong's public transport service which
are thought to have faulty brakes have been recalled by the
manufacturer Toyota.
</P>
<P>
Crown Motors, the sole Toyota distributor in Hong Kong, has
been instructed to replace defective brake parts free of charge in
about 3,400 vehicles sold between December 1989 and July last
year, according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
Most of the suspect vehicles recalled were minibuses.
</P>
<P>
Officials of Hong Kong's Transport Department have expressed
concern that public safety could have been put at risk while
spokesmen for the public-light-bus industry were worried they may
lose money if the replacement process interfered with the buses
schedules.
</P>
<P>
A Crown Motors spokeswoman said vacuum pumps in the brake
system of the vehicles were found to be defective and replacement
parts from Japan had been delivered to be installed in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,000 Coasters, more than 1,000 Dynas and a few Land
Cruisers have been affected and more are expected to be scrapped
because of their age.
</P>
<P>
But the Hong Kong, Kowloon and New Territories Minibus
Association is obviously worried about the recall as about 90
percent of Hong Kong's 4,350 minibuses were Coasters. "We haven't
had any significant problems with the Coaster's braking system,"
said the association's chairman Leung Hung. The association is
concerned that the replacement might affect the business.
</P>
<P>
Transport Advisory Committee chairman Raymond Ho Chung-tai
urged owners of the affected vehicles to contact the dealers for
the parts replacement.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think anyone should underestimate the importance of a
recall of this nature. It involves public safety and must be
taken seriously," he said.

</P>

interest in political issues aimed at splitting the motherland.

</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The proposal by former First Secretary of Socialist Party
Henri Emmanuelli to ban the extreme rightist National Front was
responded with scepticism by most political parties. The call to
ban the National Front was made after its president Jean-Marie Le
Pen repeatedly claimed in public that he believes in the theory of
"racial inequality."
</P>
<P>
The decision by the National Front to stage a demonstration in
Marseilles to protest the murder of a boy, which it regarded as
"an anti-French racist murder," has however resulted in a wave of
protests against the party itself.
</P>
<P>
-- The United States is ready to pound Iraq again. The F-117
stealth bombers of the U.S. Air Force have been dispatched to the
Gulf after two F-16 fighters were targeted by Iraqi missiles on
Wednesday morning over the extended no-fly zone in southern Iraq.
The F-117 is equipped with missiles much more destructive than
those fired last week.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The National Front is calling for a demonstration in
Marseilles after the 14-year-old little Nicolas was murdered by a
man reportedly from North Africa. Meanwhile, the Socialist Party
has launched a lawsuit against National Front president Jean-Marie
Le Pen for the racist declarations he made.
</P>
<P>
Le Pen for his part accused "political-media class" of trying
to "cover the racist and anti-French character in the murder" of
little Nicolas.
</P>
<P>
-- French President Jacques Chirac, now on a visit in Poland,
has expressed his hope that Poland will be admitted by the
European Union in three or four years. "France says yes to the
enlargement of the European Union to Poland and yes to the
enlargement of NATO to Poland, against the background of global
negotiations with Russia and the CIS," Chirac told his Polish
counterpart Aleksander Kwasniewski.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng has
called for standard accounting and auditing systems to be
established to ensure the healthy development of China's socialist
market economy.
</P>
<P>
Meeting today with board members of Price Waterhouse, one of
the world's six largest international accounting companies, Li
said that many accounting and auditing offices have been set up in
China, and that this number is growing with the country's
continuous economic development.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, standardized accounting and auditing systems are
needed to keep China's socialist market economy on the right
track, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Li briefed the visitors on China's economic
situation and the country's policies on taxation, accounting and
auditing.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China still does not have a complete accounting
management system, and much work needs to be done in this area.
</P>
<P>
The board members of Price Waterhouse are holding their annual
board meeting in China for the first time. Li said that by holding
their meeting here, Price Waterhouse has shown that it values
cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
"We encourage Chinese-foreign economic exchanges, including the
cooperation in the accounting area," he said.
</P>
<P>
Price Waterhouse has extensive experience in training
professional accountants, and the company is now helping Chinese
financial departments to design bank accounting and monitoring
systems which conform to international standards.
</P>
<P>
Li said he hopes that Price Waterhouse can continue to offer
high-level professional service to China's economic construction.
</P>
<P>
Price Waterhouse board members said they were excited by the
development in China. The company began cooperation with China
some 17 years ago, and will continue to provide personnel training
and technical consulting services.
</P>
<P>
The three-day board meeting began here yesterday.

<HEADLINE> China to Build 28 Nature Reserves for Giant Panda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- China will build 28 nature
reserves for giant pandas in order to more effectively protect the
"living fossil" from extinction.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Ministry of Forestry said that building
these reserves is the main task of a special project to preserve
giant panda habitats, thereby saving 95 percent of the wild giant
panda population.
</P>
<P>
There are about 1,000 wild giant pandas now in China, with
habitats totalling 13,000 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Plans are complete for 19 reserves; 14 are currently under
construction.
</P>
<P>
The official said that 32 observation stations and 17 passage
belts will be built in and between these reserves. And the country
has established a breeding and rescue center, in west China's
Sichuan Province, for wild rare animals.
</P>
<P>
China's remaining giant pandas have been separated into more
than 20 small groups, some with only three or four members. This,
plus natural hazards, natural enemies, diseases and some human
factors, has pushed the giant panda toward extinction, the
official said.

<P>
CANBERRA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended
weaker against the US dollar today.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was traded at 79.88 US cents from 79.93
at Wednesday's close.
</P>
<P>
The local currency's failure to break through the 80 US cents
level worried a lot of investors. The Australian dollar failed to
sustain its strong momentum after making remarkable gains in the
last week.
</P>
<P>
This might prompt investors to dump the currency to stop losses
and might send the Australian dollar down to 79.60 US cents, local
traders said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended firmer against the Japanese yen at
87.88 yen from 87.83 Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But it lost ground against the German mark, ending at 1.2043
marks from 1.2073.

<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- China today urged the
Japanese government to be fully aware of the seriousness of the
issue of Diaoyu Island and move to stop any actions that infringe
upon China's state sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question concerning the issue at today's
routine press conference, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen
Guofang said that time and again the Chinese government has
solemnly represented its position to the Japanese government and
expressed its strong indignation over Japan's stand.
</P>
<P>
"The Japanese government should recognize the seriousness of
the issue and take concrete actions to stop the right-wingers from
continuing any actions which infringe upon China's state
sovereignty," Shen said. Otherwise, the situation will become more
serious and the issue more complicated, he added.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Japan's actions over the Diaoyu Island, some
Japanese officials and right-wingers recently argued over its
history of aggression and attempted to deny the facts, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Whether Japan can win trust from Asian countries and even the
whole world depends on whether it can stop the actions by the
right-wingers on the Diaoyu Island and whether it can correct its
attitude towards its history of aggression," the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Government to Take Measures to Offset </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 12, (Xinhua) -- The Jordanian government is
considering to adopt bold initiatives to reduce the prices of
bread and fodder so as to lift the heavy burden on the citizens.
</P>
<P>
The move comes after the government has studied various reports
 on the living conditions of Jordanians by governors and other
officials from different parts of the country following last
month's riots in the south. The riots were caused by a bread price
hike.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Minister of Supply Muneer Suber was quoted by the
English-language weekly The Star, published here today, as saying
that "The government intends to reduce the price of bread and
fodder," when "the prices of wheat and barley are decreased in the
 exporting countries."
</P>
<P>
He disclosed Jordan and Syria had agreed on a formula under
which Syrians will provide the kingdom with barley in exchange
for cement.
</P>
<P>
The minister added that Syria is ready to "supply Jordan with
barley, and in return will get any commodity available in Jordan
and much-needed goods by the Syrian market."
</P>
<P>
On the local economic scene, Suber said that "liberalization of
prices won't be limited to bread and fodder but it will include
fruit and vegetables."
</P>
<P>
"The lifting of subsidy on rice, sugar and powdered milk is a
matter of time," he affirmed.
</P>
<P>
Within a period of six to seven months, all the prices will be
completely freed as the coupon system will be canceled then, the
minister explained.
</P>
<P>
The coupon system was introduced in 1989 following riots in
south Jordan due to price hikes.
</P>
<P>
Suber said the government "will compensate the needy for the
hike."
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the compensation would be about 25 dinars
(about 35 U.S. dollars) annually for each citizen, including the
current 15-dinar (about 22 dollars) bread compensation.
</P>
<P>
The measures are believed to be designed to enable Jordan to
enter the international free market and reduce the impact of the
economic recession.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is planning to sign a partnership agreement with the
European Union and join the World Trade Organization, the largest
global trade bloc.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that there is a pressing need to reform
the deteriorating economic mechanism, something that was left
pending for too long.
</P>
<P>
The previous policies of the government, experts here believe,
lack bold steps to prepare the country for the coming economic
challenges.

URUMQI, September 12 (Xinhua) -- A 1,502-kilogram chunk of jade
on display at an economic trade fair in Urumqi, capital of
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, has caused a

It took workers 70 days to transport the jade on a special
trailer from the heart of the Taklimakan Desert, which is called
the "Sea of Death," to Urumqi, passing through the Kunlun and
Tianshan mountains.
</P>
<P>
Investors from both China and abroad were amazed at the size of

<HEADLINE> US Sends 8 Stealth Jets to Kuwait for Attacks on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Eight U.S. F-117A Stealth
jet fighters were on their way to Kuwait on a mission to help
launch possibly further strikes against Iraqi targets.
</P>
<P>
English-language daily Kuwait Times today reported that to back
threats of new military strikes against Iraq, the United States
moved F-117A Stealth fighters and B-52 bombers closer to the Gulf
region and eight additional stealth jets were sent to Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Neither U.S. diplomats nor Kuwaiti military officials are
available for comment or confirmation of the news, as the country
spends holidays Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
The action was taken in response to Iraq's defiance of the
"no-fly zones" in northern and southern Iraq set up by Western
powers to protect Kurds in the north and Shi'ite Moslems in the
south.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said it fired three Sam-6 surface-to-surface missiles at
U.S. warplanes policing a "no-fly zone" in southern Iraq Tuesday
and another missile at two F-16 jets policing a "no-fly zone" in
northern Iraq Wednesday, but both missed the targets.
</P>
<P>
President Saddam Hussein had reportedly begun rebuilding Iraq's
battered southern air defense, and the Pentagon warned that the
U.S. forces might quickly resume military strikes on Iraq if it
continued to rebuild air defense destroyed in the two salvos of
missiles attacks by the U.S. on September 3 and 4.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. forces launched 44 missiles against selected air
defense targets in southern Iraq in retaliation of Iraqi troops
offensive against the safe haven for Kurds in northern Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese FM to Visit Damascus Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Foreign Minister
Farez Bouiez is scheduled to leave here today for Damascus to
meet with his Syrian counterpart Farouq al-Shara on the latest
developments in the region.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed official sources said Boueiz and Shara would
hold a meeting in order to coordinate the positions of the two
countries on the eve of a meeting of Arab foreign ministers
in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The two men are expected to discuss all the issues to be raised
at the Arab League's council session, including a recent meeting
between Palestinian Authority leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Netanyahu's visit to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz, who is scheduled to return home tonight, is also due to
 leave for Cairo Friday at head of a Lebanese delegation to the
106th meeting of the Arab League Council.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure for the Syrian capital, the foreign
minister attended a meeting of President Elias Hrawi and Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri in the Beirut Presidential Palace this
morning.
</P>
<P>
Reliable official sources close to the president said that
Hrawi, Hariri and Boueiz discussed a new Israeli threat against
their country and quick steps which the Lebanese diplomats could
take to prevent the Jewish state from executing its threat.
</P>
<P>
Israel repeated Wednesday the so-called "Lebanon First"
proposal it had put forward earlier, threatening to launch
military operations against Lebanon if the proposal was turned
down.
</P>
<P>
Israel's threat came from Antoine Lahd, commander of Israel's
client militia of the South Lebanon Army that patrols the
"security zone," a southern Lebanese border strip occupied by the
Jewish state since 1978.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after taking office in June, Netanyahu said
that he would pull the Israeli forces out of south
Lebanon if a cessation of guerrilla attacks at northern Israel
was guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria have turned down the proposal, on the
grounds that it was aimed at separating the Lebanese and
Syrian tracks in the peace negotiations with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
In a related development Wednesday, Lahd said that "Israel is
insisting on the Lebanon First proposal," warning that "a
substitute will be large-scale operations which no body knows
where they will stop."
</P>
<P>
He claimed that the development of situation had put the
Lebanese state before two choices without the third.
</P>
<P>
"The first choice is to seriously take the Lebanese First...in
exchange for an Israeli withdrawal beyond the international
border between the two countries," Lahd said.
</P>
<P>
He asked the Lebanese government to resort to a "referendum" if
it was difficult for the government to take a decision on the
issue.
</P>
<P>
The second choice was to insist on an unconditional
implementation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 425, which
calls for an Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon without
preconditions.
</P>
<P>
"In this case, there will be two possibilities, the first
of which is a continuity of the present situation in
south Lebanon without security and stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
"And the second possibility is an escalation of the
situation to an extent leading to a large-scale Israeli
military operation in south Lebanon which no body knows
where they will stop and which will destroy every thing,"
the general of Israel's client militia said.

to strictly observe the rules on the management of stock exchanges

they should also help prevent clients from violating rules.
</P>
<P>
Wang urged listed companies to be more responsible for their
share holders and standardize their operations and methods for

<HEADLINE> Shanghai People Enjoying CDs of Their Own Voice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Tang Helin, who has been
working in China's largest city for a long time, has just made his
first CD recording of his own voice -- singing opera.
</P>
<P>
Tang took his wife and daughter and a cousin along to a
recording studio in the city center one weekend recently, where he
sang excerpts from local Shanghai opera, accompanied by his
daughter. The CD included performances by his wife and cousin. The
entire process took only two hours, and the results were deemed
quite satisfying.
</P>
<P>
"At 55, I have no hobby except for singing snatches of Shanghai
opera. Then, someone told me that people could do their own
performances themselves here if they covered the expenses. So,
here I am," the road construction worker explained.
</P>
<P>
This particular studio has had more than 100 local residents,
from 13 to 59 years of age and from all walks of life, coming in
for the same purpose, all paying for the experience themselves.
</P>
<P>
Weng Yongjie, who works for the Shanghai Railway Bureau, took
her daughter to the studio. "My daughter's 13th birthday is at the
beginning of next month. She sings quite well and we're going to
cut a disc to record her nice childhood voice as a lifetime
memory. A good birthday present, isn't it?" Weng asked proudly.
</P>
<P>
According to Yu Da, director of Paris-Shanghai Music
Corporation, Ltd., a standard CD recording and 20 cassette tapes
costs a total of 888 yuan. The company, which was set up by the
local radio station and a French company, provides music programs
to more than 50 radio stations in China.
</P>
<P>
"We began this business on June 27, just as a trial, and it
turned out to be a success," said Yu, who also said that many
people in Shanghai come to the studio to record their own voices,
singing folk songs, pop songs, and local opera, such as Shanghai
opera and Beijing opera.
</P>
<P>
In fact, the studio's recording schedule is by now booked full
through the month of September.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Funds and Banks Attracted to Wuhan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, September 12 (Xinhua) -- This capital of central China's
Hubei Province has become a major destination of overseas capital,
with more and more multi-nationals investing here.
</P>
<P>
Currently there are 3,596 foreign-funded enterprises in Wuhan,
more than in any other Chinese cities in the interior region.
</P>
<P>
Observers note that the number of investors from Europe,
America and Japan is on a steady rise. Seventy percent of the 150
inspection teams to Wuhan in the first half of this year are from
the three areas, compared with 30 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
A city official said that Germany's Siemens, the Netherlands'
Philips and other multi-nationals have made investments in Wuhan,
and foreign financial institutions are also rushing to the city
for a piece of the rapidly-expanding market.
</P>
<P>
To date, seven overseas banks, including Japan's Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank and France's Societe Generale de Banque, have set up
representative offices here. America's Citibank, Japan's Sumitomo
Bank and several others from Germany and the Netherlands intend to
follow suit.
</P>
<P>
An official at the Wuhan branch of the People's Bank of China,
the central bank, said that foreign investment and the presence of
foreign financial institutions appear to go hand in hand in Wuhan.
</P>
<P>
"The effort to attract overseas funds and financial
institutions has entered a healthy cycle," the official said.

<HEADLINE> Israel, US Work Out Draft to Restart Talks With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Israel and the U.S. this
week have written a draft, which addresses unsigned
understandings achieved by the previous Israeli government, in an
effort to restart the Israeli-Syrian peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Today's Jerusalem Post reported that U.S. Middle East
coordinator Dennis Ross will bring the draft, which was
completed this week during Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
visit to the U.S., to Syria when he travels to the region
next week.
</P>
<P>
The development of the draft came after reports that late
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin made a conditional promise to U.S.
President Bill Clinton regarding to an Israeli withdrawal from
the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Rabin had reportedly promised in 1994 that Israel would
withdraw from the Golan Heights to the June 4, 1967 borders
as part of a peace treaty, once Israel was satisfied with
Golan-related security arrangements and normalization.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured the Golan Heights from Syria during the the
Third Middle East war, or Six-Day War, in 1967. In 1981, the
Knesset (Israel's parliament) passed the Golan Law which
incorporated the strategic heights into the State of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel, in the new draft, accepted some of the
understandings reached between Syria and the Labor government,
but refused to adopt the rest of them, the report added.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that the issue of what Rabin told
Clinton is assuming relevance today, as the Syrians ask the
new Israeli government to affirm these understandings.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Netanyahu government views the understandings,
which include a May 1995 unsigned Israeli-Syrian paper that
declares "equality" will be the principle governing security
arrangements, as non-binding.
</P>
<P>
The draft written this week in the U.S. deals precisely
with the question of the validity of past verbal or unsigned
understandings, the newspaper said in a front story.
</P>
<P>
It seems the Netanyahu government still insists that past
arrangements be not binding, but it is reportedly willing to
"take them into account" during negotiations with Syria.

<HEADLINE> Over 1,000 Iraqi Refugees Hospitalized in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 12 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,000 Iraqi Kurdish
refugees have been hospitalized in western Iran, local media
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Tehran Radio reported that the sick Iraqi
refugees are sheltered in Sanandaj, capital of Kurdestan province,
about 525 kilometers west of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, Iran has allowed entry of 39,000 sick, wounded and
old Kurds across the Iranian borders as refugees. The rest are
outside the Iranian borders and are being provided with necessary
aid.
</P>
<P>
The radio said that a U.N. delegation had been to the border
region, but Kurdish refugees refused to talks with U.N. officials due
to the world organization's "indifference" to the plight of the
refugees.
</P>
<P>
Iran's Red Crescent Society (RCS) called on international
organizations to rush tents, blankets, clothes, medicine and
foodstuff, as the number of displaced Iraqi Kurds from the
city of Sulaimainiyah reached 200,000 at the Iranian border.
</P>
<P>
The society said that RCS relief workers had already begun
helping the refugees on the border points of the provinces
of Kermanshah, Kurdestan and West Azarbaijan.
</P>
<P>
RCS had shipped 40 tons of sugar, 20 tons of vegetable
oil, 40 tons of rice, 240 tons of flour, 131,000 tons of
canned food, 10,000 tons of milk powder, 1,800 cartons of
bread, 20 tons of tea, 20 tons of beans, 10 tons of dates
and 20,000 blankets to the area to be distributed among the
refugees.

CANBERRA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Todd Woodbridge, one of
Australian specialist doubles pair with Mark Woodforde, would not
play the Davis Cup tie against Croatia in later September.

Woodbridge had quited next week's World Group qualifying tie in
Split on September 20-22 since he will undergo minor surgery for

"It is a blow not to have Todd for the doubles, but we are
fortunate to have a number of good doubles players on the team,"
Newcombe said in a statement released by Tennis Australia.

Woodforde and Woodbridge, the world's top-ranked pair, have
won seven Grand Slam titles, including the defence of their

Newcombe said Woodforde would probably team up with Pat Rafter

<HEADLINE> Some 184 AIDS Patients Found Dead in Vietnam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 12 (Xinhua) -- A total of 184 AIDS sufferers
were found dead in Vietnam by August 31 this year, according to
local media today.
</P>
<P>
By the end of August, 4,209 HIV carriers, including 80
foreigners, had been reported throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
Of the HIV carriers in the nation, 353 have developed
full-blown AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Ho Chi Minh city was hit with the highest number of 1,752
HIV/AIDS victims, followed by 337 in the central province of Khanh
Hoa and 21 in Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
HIV carriers have also been found in the northern provinces of
Ninh Binh, Quang Ninh, Bac Thai, Vinh Phu and Thanh Hoa.
</P>
<P>
AIDS prevention and consultancy in the country have met many
difficulties because most patients were reluctant to provide their
personal information including names and addresses to medical
workers, the media said.
</P>
<P>
HIV carriers in the country have now been put under the control
of local health care centers, but they have not yet received any
kind of special treatment because Vietnam cannot afford to import
medicine to fight the killer disease.

<HEADLINE> China to Take Steps to Improve Housing for Elderly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- China is to target the
improvement of housing for the elderly in the coming years,
according to China Population News.
</P>
<P>
Central and local governments at all levels will increase
investments in housing construction.
</P>
<P>
Steps will be taken to reform the existing housing system,
including selling public houses to residents, lifting rents and
setting up funds for home construction.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said by 1995, China had 120 million elderly
people, aged 60 or above, accounting for 9.8 percent of the
country's total population.
</P>
<P>
The population of over-60s is expected to reach as many as 410
million in the next century, accounting for 27 percent of the
total, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the elderly population will be a heavy burden
for China's future social and economic development.
</P>
<P>
China has achieved rapid economic development, and living
standards of its people have been improved by a wide margin since
the introduction of policy of reforms and opening-up. But a big
and growing population and less developed economy left many
elderly people living in poor houses.
</P>
<P>
About 5.9 percent of pensioners in urban areas and 6.3 percent
in rural areas, do not have seperate rooms of their own, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Reports from the Ministry of Civil Affairs show that there are
only 730,000 elderly people in the country who live in public
homes for old people, accounting for 0.6 percent of the total
population of over 60s, indicating that the majority of old people
still live with their own children.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Elections be of Historical Significance: Bildt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian general election
due to be held on Saturday is of "historical significance," Carl
Bildt, the International Civil Representative in Bosnia, said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The elections were very important for Bosnia and even for the
whole area of the former Yugoslavia, Bildt told reporters today at
the International Press Center.
</P>
<P>
The elections would prescribe all the constitutional principles
for the implementation of the Dayton agreement signed between the
conflicting parties in former Yugoslavia last December, which
ended the nearly four-year Bosnian war, Bildt said.
</P>
<P>
He said the elections would open the way for the establishment
of the common institutions of Bosnia-Herzegovina based on the
Muslim-Croat Federation and the Serbs' Repblika Srpska.
</P>
<P>
Bildt stressed that the common institutions of Bosnia would
create the conditions for the settlement of the country's problems
in the economy, social welfare, refugees and the reconstruction of
the country.
</P>
<P>
The pre-election atmosphere was very good because the Bosnian
Serbs had set up good cooperation with the Interior Ministry of
the Muslim-Croat Federation, Bildt said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if some people intended to create incidents
during the elections, the multi-national peace-keeping forces and
the United Nations international police would stop them.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions by the international community against the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia would be lifted 10 days after the
general elections under the Dayton peace accord, Bildt said.

<HEADLINE> Market Recovery In Southern China's Real Estate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, September 12 (Xinhua) -- After a period of fairly
sluggish activity, China's real estate market has shown signs of
recovery, judging from recent activity in Shenzhen, in south
China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Two tracts of land there recently attracted 45 bidders who
pushed the final price up to 90 percent more than the asking
price, with one going for 62.9 million yuan and the other for
123.65 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time in four years that land use rights in
Shenzhen were sold by public bid. The results seem to show a
growing confidence in the city's real estate market.
</P>
<P>
Both tracts were in the Futian District, the future downtown
area of an expanded Shenzhen. One tract, at Jingtian, covers 8,250
sq.m., and the other, at Shixianan, covers 18,700 sq m. The two
will be used for multi-story buildings with a 70-year lease.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Ministry of Construction in charge of real
estate predicts that Shenzhen, which borders Hong Kong, will have
a flourishing real estate market in 1997, with housing becoming a
new consumer trend.
</P>
<P>
China has encouraged the building of more low-cost flats and
has limited the construction of expensive luxury housing.

<HEADLINE> Bangkok Declares War on Elephants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Bangkok police have declared
war on mahouts roaming Bangkok's streets on their elephants after
the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration called for tougher action
from the police, according to local daily The Nation today.
</P>
<P>
Metropolitan Police Chief Pol. Lt.-Gen. Sophon Waratchanon has
instructed traffic police officers in the city to arrest and fine
the mahouts, who will be charged with obstructing traffic.
</P>
<P>
Sophon was quoted as saying that cleanliness and public order
regulations should also be applied against the mahouts.
</P>
<P>
He said violators will face fines of up to 2,000 baht (80 US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
A large number of elephants roam the city's streets with their
mahouts after leaving their home provinces in the hopes of finding
a better life in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The mahouts offer to sell onlookers fruit to feed the animals.
The mahouts also make money from people who wish to walk under the
elephants' bellies in the belief that it will bring them good
luck.
</P>
<P>
Some senior traffic policemen expressed sympathy for the
mahouts. Pol. Lt.-Col. Nakhon Promkhan, a traffic inspector at
Bukkalo Police Station, said that he will inform the mahouts that
riding their animals on the streets is against the law. Fining the
offenders would be a last resort, he said, adding that the amount
will not exceed 200 baht (8 US dollars).

NEW DELHI, September 12 (Xinhua) -- It is estimated that every
year almost 800,000 people die from heart disease and more than
600,000 from stroke in India, said the regional health report of
the World Health Organization (WHO) here.
</P>
<P>
The results of a health survey in New Delhi, capital of India,
conducted earlier revealed that every tenth person aged between 35
to 64 years suffers from heart disease and every fourth person has
high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
Data from India and Nepal show that 35 and 46 percent of
patients in these two countries are resistant to tuberculosis
drugs, thus rendering them untreatable, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Diseases like polio, neonatal tetanus and leprosy are on the
verge of eradication, others like plague and malaria, that had
almost disappeared, have re-appeared.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Peace Agreement Is Not Legally Binding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The peace agreement reached by
Security Council Secretary Alexander Lebed and Chechen rebel
commander Aslan Maskhadov on August 31 is not legally binding,
said Russian Justice Minister Valentin Kovalyov today.
</P>
<P>
The Lebed-Maskhadov agreement constitutes a political
declaration, but not a law in a strick sense, Kovalyov told the
Interfax News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, two more documents -- one defining the
status of the Chechen republic and the other dividing and
determining functions and rights of Chechnya and Russia -- need to
be signed, said Kovalyov.
</P>
<P>
These documents, he said, will not only safeguard peace of
Chechnya, but also unity and territorial integrity of Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Ministry, after investigation, has found the
Lebed-Maskhadov deal differ from the proposals originally agreed
upon by the Security Council. It failed to mention Russia's
territorial integrity, the disbandment of the rebel troops and the
role of Doku Zavgayev's pro-Moscow government in the republic, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Interfax reported that President Boris Yelstin
has instructed Lebed, his special envoy on the Chechen issue, to
consider the ministry's proposals in future dealings with the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
Also, Vladimir Lukin, chairman of Russian parliament's Foreign
Affairs Committee today blasted the Council of Europe that
invites Lebed and Maskhadov to a conference late this month in
Strasbourg, saying the move is "a rude, impertinent and
unprecedented" interference in Russia's internal affairs. Echoing
Lukin, Zavgayev charged the Council of slapping "on Chechen
people's face" by inviting Maskhadov -- "a traitor and
slaughterer".
</P>
<P>
Lukin has already urged Lebed not to attend the conference,
reports said.

<HEADLINE> WTO Asked to Be Pragmatic in Implementing URA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
here today called on the World Trade Organization (WTO) to make
realistic and pragmatic approaches in the implementation of the
Uruguay Rounds Agreements (URA) to spare the developing countries
from unnecessary political and social risks.
</P>
<P>
Opening the 28th ASEAN Economic Ministers Meeting (AEM) at the
presidential palace, Soeharto said that lowering the competitive
edge of export commodities of the developing countries will only
widen the gap between developed and developing countries.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the WTO should concentrate its attention
more on concrete trade issues and not divert its attention to
issues beyond them.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming WTO ministerial meeting to be held in Singapore
at the end of this year, "will become a very important and
decisive factor in our effort to secure the compliance of its
member-states to their commitments to the Uruguay Rounds," noted
the president.
</P>
<P>
He said as a forward-looking regional organization that
consistently adheres to the principle of open regionalism, ASEAN
is always aware of the increasingly strong interdependence and
integration of the global economy.
</P>
<P>
For this reason, he said, "We should continue to play an active
role in the APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation) process with
a view to helping reinforce economic liberalization and free
trade, not just in the area but also in the world."
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that the ASEAN must continue to act
as a bridge in the relationship between ASIA and Europe, by the
active participation of ASEAN in the various activities to
follow-up the Asia-Europe meeting that took place last March in
Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
He said the ASEAN will continue to develop and improve the most
suitable means for its interaction with economic groupings in
other regions.
</P>
<P>
To complement to ASEAN economic cooperative actions, Soeharto
hoped the private sector and various growth areas will play
greater role in the future.
</P>
<P>
He also appealed to the ASEAN economic ministers to develop new
initiatives for the promotion of small and medium enterprises that
have great potentials in creating employment opportunities.
</P>
<P>
"Our cooperation in this sector must not be limited to merely
meet domestic and regional needs, but we must try to penetrate
wide global market," he stressed.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The Indian Commerce
Ministry is considering to give industry status to cash crops in a
bid to promote agriculture exports, Commerce Ministry sources said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The government has given a major thrust to agro-exports.
</P>
<P>
As a result, agricultural exports have gone up from 72,213.1
million rupees (2.4 billion US dollars ) in 1992-93 to 156,593
million rupees (4.9 billion dollars) in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
Exports of agro-products and marine items in the first quarter
of 1996-97 went up to 61,505 million rupees (1.8 billion dollars),
up by 86.03 percent over that in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Ministry is working to promote flowers and
coconuts exports. For this, auction centers are being set up in
the country.
</P>
<P>
It has been argued that the government should declare cash
crops of the country as an industry so that all benefits could be
extended to rubber, pepper, cardamom and so on, the same sources
said.

<P>
MOSCOW, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Russia has refused to take
part in a hearing organized by the Council of Europe, the Russian
Interfax Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said Chairman of the Russian State Duma Gennady
Seleznev and Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affairs Vladimir
Lukin have officially written to Franz Fischler, Speaker of the
Council of Europe, informing him that the Russian parliament
delegation would not attend the hearing.
</P>
<P>
The two Russian officials said they could not convey the
council's invitation to Chechen military leader Aslan Maskhadov,
because this will contravene an agreement reached between Russia
and the Council of Europe in June.
</P>
<P>
The agreement allowed both parties to the Chechen conflict to
attend the hearing.
</P>
<P>
The Russian leaders said Russia's unilateral participation will
deal a heavy blow to the hard-won peace process in Chechnya and
aggravate antagonism among the Chechens.
</P>
<P>
They accused the Council of Europe of direct intervention in
the Russian internal affairs, the Interfax said.

<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has been increasing
air links with foreign countries in recent years to open the door
wider to the outside world and attract more foreign tourists.
</P>
<P>
"Visit Myanmar Year 96" is scheduled to start on a grand scale
in mid-November in the peak tourism season in the country.
</P>
<P>
An air link is due to be established between Yangon and Bandar

<HEADLINE> Thailand Wins Bargains over Sensitive Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has won an initial
triumph in persuading the Philippines to agree to liberalize all
agricultural products by 2010 under the ASEAN Free Trade Area
(AFTA) instead of 2020, the Bangkok Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The products include rice and sugar, the most controversial and
sensitive items within the AFTA, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough came at an AFTA Council meeting on Wednesday
in Jakarta, capital of Indonesia, the report said. The council is
a ministerial committee that supervises the implementation of the
AFTA program and reports to economic ministers of ASEAN
(Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Thai negotiators insisted that ASEAN members
should strictly comply with what they agreed at the last AFTA
Council meeting held in Singapore. The agreement was that
sensitive products should be brought gradually into the
tariff-cutting scheme, starting in 2001-2003 and ending by 2010.
</P>
<P>
The Filipino representatives later dropped their objection,
admitting that Thailand's interpretation was correct, the
newspaper quoted a Thai official present at the meeting as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, Indonesia's position has remained unclear on the issue
and the Indonesian negotiators said that they would reconsider it
soon.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia and the Philippines had earlier said that they would
only start lowering trade barriers on highly sensitive products,
such as rice and sugar, in 2010 and ending them in 2020.

<HEADLINE> China to Strengthen Registration on Medical Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The State Pharmaceutical
Administration (SPA) will begin registering medical devices and
products next year, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and foreign manufacturers or their agents will have to
register their products with the SPA to sell them in the Chinese
market, according to new provisions issued by the SPA last week.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the new rules is to ensure users' safety and
protect their rights, said Bu Qicheng, director of the Medical
Device Administration Department of SPA.
</P>
<P>
Unregistered products will be prohibited from advertising and
from being displayed at exhibitions or any other public places.
Distribution of unregistered products will be banned.
</P>
<P>
Punishments will range from a warning to fines as high as 30,000
yuan (3,600 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
More than 600 firms make medical devices in China, according to
the SPA. About ten percent are joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
The companies turn out 3,000 different products a year, valued
at six billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The SPA began extending its supervision over medical devices
early this year. Almost all domestic products have been
registered, but only one-third of imported medical devices have
SPA licences.
</P>
<P>
Medical products refer to any instrument, apparatus, material
or other articles, whether used alone or in combination, including
the instructions and materials necessary for application as
intended by the manufacturers, intended for use by human beings.
</P>
<P>
Medical products are classified by the SPA into three
categories:
</P>
<P>
-- Class one covers products for which conventional management
is sufficient to ensure safety and effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
-- Class two covers products with internationally and
domestically approved mechanisms, using time-proven techniques and
which must be SPA-registered to ensure safety and effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
-- Class three devices are those that can be placed or
implanted into a human body, for life-supporting purposes, but
which might present a potential risk to the human body.

<HEADLINE> Chile-Mercosur Accord Speeds Up Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The complementary economic
agreement, signed by Chile and the Southern Common Market
(Mercosur), will speed up integration in Latin America and the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
The point is made by the Caracas-based Latin American Economic
System (SELA) in a document entitled "Strategic Notes of August."
It said that positive repercussions of the agreement in politics,
economies and commerce are not only regional but also
hemispherical and multilateral.
</P>
<P>
Marking a milestone in the consolidation and convergence of
regional integration, the agreement was vital to the shaping of
the Free Trade Agreement of the Americas (FTAA), programmed for
the year 2005, it added.
</P>
<P>
SELA believed the agreement between Chile and Mercosur, which
comprises Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay, reflected the
vitality, political drive and potentialities of integrationist
forces among Latin American and Caribbean countries.
</P>
<P>
It showed that regional integration was the first step to
facilitate the formation of the FTAA, SELA said.
</P>
<P>
The liberalization of trade between Chile and Mercosur foresees
the progressive elimination of tariffs from October 1, 1996, to
the year 2016.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, Chile does not join in the
mechanism of integration but rather in the creation of a free
trade zone for a definite period of time, and free tariffs for
both sides.
</P>
<P>
The Mercosur has become the 4th most important trade partner
for Chile following the European Union, Japan and the United
States.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Peace Agreement Is Not Legally Binding: A. Lebed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The peace agreement reached by
Security Council Secretary Alexander Lebed and Chechen rebel
commander Aslan Maskhadov on August 31 is not legally binding,
said Russian Justice Minister Valentin Kovalyov today.
</P>
<P>
The Lebed-Maskhadov agreement constitutes a political
declaration, but not a law in a strick sense, Kovalyov told the
Interfax News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, two more documents -- one defining the
status of the Chechen republic and the other dividing and
determining functions and rights of Chechnya and Russia -- need to
be signed, said Kovalyov.
</P>
<P>
These documents, he said, will not only safeguard peace of
Chechnya, but also unity and territorial integrity of Russia.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Ministry, after investigation, has found the
Lebed-Maskhadov deal differ from the proposals originally agreed
upon by the Security Council. It failed to mention Russia's
territorial integrity, the disbandment of the rebel troops and the
role of Doku Zavgayev's pro-Moscow government in the republic, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Interfax reported that President Boris Yelstin
has instructed Lebed, his special envoy on the Chechen issue, to
consider the ministry's proposals in future dealings with the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
Also, Vladimir Lukin, chairman of Russian parliament's Foreign
Affairs Committee today blasted the Council of Europe that
invites Lebed and Maskhadov to a conference late this month in
Strasbourg, saying the move is "a rude, impertinent and
unprecedented" interference in Russia's internal affairs. Echoing
Lukin, Zavgayev charged the Council of slapping "on Chechen
people's face" by inviting Maskhadov -- "a traitor and
slaughterer".
</P>
<P>
Lukin has already urged Lebed not to attend the conference,
reports said.

<HEADLINE> Copper Prices Continue to Slide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Copper prices have continued
going down in the Chinese market in the past seven months to an
average of 23,000 yuan (2,800 US dollars) per ton in July from
25,700 yuan early this year, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Tang Jiaqian, a senior engineer with the
Beijing Antaike Information Company under the China National
Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Corp, as saying that the situation is
closely related to China's output, imports and exports of copper
during the first seven months.
</P>
<P>
According to him, in the past seven months, China produced
486,500 tons of copper, representing an increase of 6.96 percent
over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Imports of copper and copper alloy jumped by 84.4 percent
during the January-July period compared with the corresponding
period last year, said Tang.
</P>
<P>
The accumulated imports of copper and cooper alloy reached
128,000 tons by the end of this July, compared with 69,400 tons at
the same time last year.
</P>
<P>
Imports of copper profile, especially copper wires, increased
by 15.2 percent, reaching 215,300 tons during the period.
</P>
<P>
The combined imports of copper reached 343,300 tons by the end
of July.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that most copper profile was imported by Sino-foreign
joint ventures. The heavy imports have weakened the demand for
refined copper, the raw material for the smelting of copper
profile, in the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
To make the situation worse, exports of copper went down by
15.6 percent during the period.
</P>
<P>
The rising output, swelling imports and reduced exports have
made the supply of copper exceed demand in the market, worsened by
the stockpile of around 250,000 tons of copper and copper profile
left over from last year.
</P>
<P>
The output in July dropped moderately since some enterprises
ceased production due to high production costs and the hot
weather. Some were also affected by the floods, forcing them to
stop production.
</P>
<P>
Copper producers are expecting that the price of copper in the
domestic market will rise so as to boost production.

the ruling National Liberation Party (PLN) deputies, the Costa
Rican Assembly has rejected the extension of the presidential term
from four to five years, Assembly President Walter Coto confirmed
today.
</P>
<P>
A reform bill has been forwarded with an aim to extend the

Coto, a member of the PLN, voted for the reform but the bill

opposition from other PLN deputies in parliament.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to Xinhua today, Coto criticized his party's
decision. Coto, who has been at odds with other party leaders
over the past few months, said the PLN's decision against the
reform contradicts the democratization efforts sought by the party
itself.
</P>

Since the opposition Social Christians hopes to return to power

BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Importers of makeup products
and domestic manufacturers of cosmetics for special use, such as
weight loss or removing skin blemishes, are being urged to have
their products tested and licensed by the Ministry of Public
Health.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Taxi Upgrade Fuels Debate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- The action of many taxi
companies in Beijing to upgrade their fleets, replacing "miandi,"
breadloaf-shaped minivans, with hatchbacks, has met heated
complaints from both taxi drivers and passengers.
</P>
<P>
A decrease in minivan taxis has become a hot issue for the
capital's 10 million residents, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Drivers who switch from miandi to new hatchback taxis will have
to purchase their new cars from their employers. The price of a
typical 1.0-litre Charade hatchback from the employer can be as
high as 130,000 yuan (15,662 US dollars), compared with the retail
price of 90,000 yuan (10,843 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
"Only the taxi company profits from the upgrading and it is
the drivers and passengers who are paying the price,"
debt-burdened drivers were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that taxi passengers will decrease by one third
after the phasing out of miandi. Yet the taxi companies earn about
30,000 yuan from the sale of each hatchback to their employees.
</P>
<P>
"The replacing of miandi with Charades is an independent action
by enterprises and does not need the approval of administrative
departments," said Zhou Yong, an official with the Beijing
Municipal Taxi Administration.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said his administration encouraged better cars, but denied
the existence of a formal document stating that the city will
forbid the use of miandi in Beijing in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Although it is popular among Beijing residents, the miandi
will be phased out sooner or later as kind of transitional model,"
said Chang Fuqiong, deputy-director of the taxi administration.
</P>
<P>
Chang blamed the apparent shortage of miandi taxis on more
drivers refusing to take passengers, saying his administration
aims to "build a taxi fleet using a single car model with the same
fare."
</P>
<P>
"We can only assure people that the low-fare taxis are not
decreasing," he said.
</P>
<P>
Miandi taxis are the favorite choice of budget-minded
Beijingers. They are the cheapest, with an initial fare of 10 yuan
(1.2 US dollars) for 10 kilometers, while the hatchbacks cost 1.6
yuan per kilometer.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing authorities have stopped renewing or issuing new
registrations for miandi since January 1 in a bid to facilitate
the modernization program.
</P>
<P>
The number of miandi has declined from 33,000 to 22,000, now
accounting for only one third of the city's 64,900 taxis.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts estimate that miandi, which are still produced
at rate of 1,000 a month, will come to a demise in Beijing within
a couple of years as most of the city's 1,420 taxi companies are
encourage or even forcing their employees to upgrade their
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Wu Jian, a senior manager of the China City Taxi Association,
claimed the miandi are not congruent with Beijing's image as a
cosmopolitan city.

</P>
<P>
The American football legend faces a civil suit from the
families of his ex-wife Nicole Brown and her friend, Ronald
Goldman, despite being acquitted of their murders following a long
and highly sensational trial.
</P>
<P>
The families are seeking financial compensation, arguing that
Simpson was responsible for the brutal deaths of their loved ones
on June 12, 1994. The former football star and sports commentator
denies any responsibility.
</P>
<P>
Judge Hiroshi Fujisaki agreed Wednesday to postpone the trial
one day past the originally scheduled date of September 17 because
Simpson will be present at another set of proceedings -- this one
involving a custody battle for the two children he had with Nicole
Brown.
</P>
<P>
Simpson's top lawyer, Robert Baker, said Wednesday he expected
the civil trial to last four months. Unlike the criminal trial,
which lasted nine months not counting jury selection, the civil
proceedings will not be televised.

<HEADLINE> Siemens Nixdorf to Introduce Information Technology to China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 12 (Xinhua) -- German company Siemens
Nixdorf Informationsysteme AG (SNI), Europe's largest information
technology supplier, is planning to occupy five percent of China's
IT market by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
At the ongoing five-day 1996 China Computerworld Exposition in
Beijing, SNI showcased its up-to-date IT and products, including
personal computers, self-service products, shop tills, R/3
enterprise management system and ticket-selling systems.
</P>
<P>
While consolidating its position in Europe, SNI, a computer
company belonging to Siemens AG, is shifting its investment focus
to the Asia-Pacific Region, especially to China, says Oskar
Tondolo, chief representative of SNI in China.
</P>
<P>
SNI, which has provided shop tills to numerous shopping malls
in China, intends to occupy nearly 20 percent of China's point of
sale machine market in the near future.
</P>
<P>
One of the world's top four ATM manufacturers, SNI has also
sold ATMs to China's many banks and financial organizations, such
as the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the
Construction Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
At the exhibition SNI is displaying its new-generation face
recognition bank cash machine, which identifies customers by their
faces, instead of relying on the usual PIN number.
</P>
<P>
SNI has provided ticket-selling systems to railway stations in
more than 10 Chinese cities and regions, helping the country
improve efficiency and accuracy in ticket-selling at stations.
</P>
<P>
During the next five years, the annual growth rate of the
company's business volume in China is expected to reach 60
percent. By the year 2000 one-third of its Asian sales will be in
China.

<HEADLINE> Vigilantes in Mindanao Defy Ramos' Call to Disarm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Armed Christian vigilantes in
Mindanao defied President Ramos's order and threatened to shoot
back at anyone who would dare to disarm them, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Vigilio Andolan, leader of the Mindanao Christian Unified
Command, accused Ramos of pampering Muslim rebels.
</P>
<P>
"Go ahead, Mr. Ramos, make our day," Andolan said on Wednesday.
"I think the time has come. We have no other alternative (but) to
protect ourselves."
</P>
<P>
The Mindanao Christian Unified Command, which claims to have
some 10,000 members, has vowed to wage a war against the Moro
National Liberation Front (MNLF) if it commits atrocities.
</P>
<P>
President Ramos ordered his military officials to take measures
to disarm the vigilantes and said their existence would hinder the
full economic development of the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Ramos' order also draw the denouncement of opposition lawmakers
in the country. They said the order must include all
non-government "military formations" such as the MNLF.
</P>
<P>
But the president downplayed the capability of the vigilante
group to create trouble in Mindanao. He said that the government
will handle the situation "according to law."

<HEADLINE> New Suspect Found in Olympics Bombing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- A single suspect has been
under investigation for the Atlanta Olympic bombing but he had
noting to do with Richard Jewell, the security guard headlined as
an early suspect, the CBS News said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Bureau of Investigation had no comment on the
report, which did not name the new suspect.
</P>
<P>
CBS said it is still unclear that what led to the bombing,
although the network reported the latest suspect may have military
training or be connected to a militia-like movement.
</P>
<P>
CBS said FBI lifted partial fingerprints from a telephone used
by someone to warn of the bomb but video monitors in the park
apparently captured no scenes of anyone depositing the bomb.
</P>
<P>
Jewell said he discovered the bomb at Centennial Olympic Park
shortly before it went off July 27, killing two people and
injuring 111 others.
</P>
<P>
First hailed as a hero, Jewell maintained his innocence since
he was first named by the Atlanta Journal as a suspect in the
bombing. Many other news reports also named Jewell as a
suspect. Charges were never filed against Jewell, although his
property was searched.
</P>
<P>
Jewell's attorneys in news conferences and television
appearances have repeatedly appealed to federal law enforcement
officials to admit Jewell was innocent.
</P>
<P>
Jewwll's mother, in a weeping appeal to President Bill Clinton,
asked the government to clear her son's name. But no such
clearance has come.

<HEADLINE> Fujian to Put 3.8 Billion Yuan for Building Teachers Apartments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, September 12 (Xinhua) -- Southeast China's coastal
Fujian Province is to spend 3.8 billion yuan (about 460 million
U.S. dollars) in building 5.54 million square meters of housing
for teachers in next five years.
</P>
<P>
A Fujian Provincial Educational Committee official said
teachers in the province are expected to have more living space
than teachers in other provinces by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Statistics shows that in 1986 each member of an urban teacher's
family only had a living space of 3.4 sqm, half of that of other
urban residents.
</P>
<P>
Many teachers in Fujian sought other jobs partly because of
poor living conditions.
</P>
<P>
Improving living conditions of teachers has been major task for
the Fujian local governments since 1988.
</P>
<P>
In 1994 and 1995, the province built up two million square
meters of housing for teachers.
</P>
<P>
In the first seven months this year, Fujian province collected
300 million yuan (about 37 million dollars) from local
governments, enterprises and overseas Chinese to build 100,000 sqm
houses for teachers.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea, Brazil Strengthen Political, Economic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Brazil and South Korea will
broaden their bilateral relations in the fields of politics,
economy and trade.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso and his South
Korean counterpart Kim Young-Sam made the statement when they held
a meeting in the Planalto Palace.
</P>
<P>
Kim said that South Korean entrepreneurs intend to invest about
5 billion U.S. dollars in Brazil in the next two years.
</P>
<P>
He affirmed on Tuesday in Sao Paulo that South Korean investors
are very interested in Brazil and the Southern Cone Common Market
which consists of Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
Before his trip to the five Latin American countries, the South
Korean president said that his visit will open the doors to a
market of nearly 450 million consumers for South Korean companies.
</P>
<P>
In 1985 trade between the two nations was 132 million
dollars. Trade volume increased to 2.9 billion dollars from 1989
to 1995.
</P>
<P>
But problems persisted in bilateral trade, such as Brazil's
trade deficit with South Korea and the Asian country's opposition
to Brazil's quota on textile imports and the rise of tariffs on
its automobile imports.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting between President Cardoso ad Kim, Brazilian
Foreign Minister Luiz Felipe Lampreia and South Korean Foreign
Minister Gong Ro-Myung signed three cooperation agreements on
mutual travel and business visas, cooperation in tourism and the
creation of a mechanism for political consultation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Kim arrived here on Tuesday for a three-day visit after his
trip to Argentina.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also signed an agreement on technology
transfer and information exchange.
</P>
<P>
Brazil is the fourth stop of Kim's visit to Latin
America. Before arriving here, the South Korean president visited
Guatemala, Chile and Argentina. He will go to Peru on September
13, the last stop of his trip to Latin America.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sends Eight Stealth Fighter-Bombers to Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Pentagon today ordered
eight radar-evading F-117 jets to the vicinity of the Gulf region
to prepare for possible third round of attack against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Confirming the deployment of the fighter-bombers, Defense
Secretary William Perry pledged a U.S. response to Saddam Hussein
"disproportionate to the provocations which were made against us."
</P>
<P>
At a campaign rally in Arizona, President Bill Clinton spoke in
similar terms.
</P>
<P>
"We will do what we must to protect our people," he said. "The
determination of the United States to deal with the problem of
Iraq should not be underestimated."
</P>
<P>
The harsh U.S. reaction came when Iraq fired two missiles at
U.S. fighter planes patrolling over northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the Pentagon announced that the United
States had moved a pair of B-52 bombers from Guam to the island of
Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean.
</P>
<P>
"The Air Force has received permission to base the B-52s on
Diego," said a Pentagon spokesman.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the F-117, Perry would not say where they would
go. An administration official said later the eight F-117s would
be dispatched to Kuwait, which authorized them to land.
</P>
<P>
The F-117s, manned by a single pilot, would reportedly fly from
Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico to the Gulf. Although the
aircraft can be refueled in flight, the trip still could take
close to a full day.
</P>
<P>
The newly deployed aircraft will join the estimated 130 U.S.
warplanes already in the region.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia did not allow U.S. aircraft based there to fly in
the first two rounds of attacks against Iraq. U.S. officials
believed that continued inability to use the Saudi-based aircraft
would severely limit chances for a major air strike against Iraqi
targets.
</P>
<P>
Until the F-117s are in place, the burden could be on the B-52s
and 70-plus aircraft on board the carrier USS Carl Vinson, whose
battle group is in the Gulf, officials said. A second carrier,
the USS Enterprise, is in the Adriatic and could be moved to the
eastern Mediterranean if needed.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Chairman Liu Huaqing Meets French Defense Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Liu Huaqing, vice-chairman of
the Central Military Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and
French Defense Minister Charles Millon today expressed their hope
that China and France will actively develop a relationship of
cooperation in all fields, including in military field.
</P>
<P>
During their talks this evening in Paris, Liu and Millon
attained a convergence of views on a wide range of issues.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that all countries around the world want today to
maintain their internal stability, develop their economy, push
forward social progress and enjoy a peaceful world situation.
</P>
<P>
He said that China wishes to actively develop its relations
with France, and to develop the relations between the armed forces
of the two countries in perspective of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Millon said that he agreed with Liu on his analysis of world
situation, and said that France wishes to develop comprehensive
cooperations with China, including a step-by-step development of
military cooperations with China.
</P>
<P>
He said that he is expecting to visit China in the first
quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that the world is moving in the direction of
multi-polarization, and that the time is gone for ever when one
state could attempt to dominate the whole world.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that any attempt by one state to dominate the
world is against the will of the international community and can
never succeed.
</P>
<P>
Millon said that France is promoting a reform of the NATO
structure in order to increase the weight of Europe within the
organization and to let Europe have the final say on European
security.

reform and European security, Liu said that China's defense policy
is purely defensive and serves to guarantee security for the
national construction of China.
</P>
<P>
He said that the per capita spending on defense in China is one
of the lowest in the world, and that China will not pose any
threat to any country.
</P>
<P>
Liu also expressed his hope that France will observe its
commitment of not to sell armaments to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Millon said that France has reached an agreement with China
over this issue, and its stand of not to sell armaments to Taiwan
will not change.
</P>
<P>
Liu and his delegation arrived here this afternoon to start a
week-long official visit to France.

</P>
<P>
British shares closed lower, down 10.5 points on the FTSE 100

Beige Book economic report, but stood its ground above the 3,900

</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the market was virtually unmoved by the news
that Britain's unemployment rate fell to a five-year low at 7.5

<P>
The German shares in Frankfurt traded nervously and ended the

Dampening sentiment, said dealers, was Wall Street's weakness

The Paris bourse followed London and Frankfurt's suit and
finished marginally weaker after climbing for five consecutive

Traders said that consolidation remained the order of the day.
"The market has been climbing for five days and now needs to
breathe a bit," one commented.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Review Cattle Slaughter Plan: Major </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John
Major said here today that his government would review a program
to slaughter some 147,000 cattle most at risk from BSE or mad cow
disease, putting Britain on a collision course with the European
Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Major, who is under increasing pressure from farmers and
members of his Conservative Party to scrap the slaughter plan,
told reporters earlier today that a cabinet meeting on Thursday
would discuss new scientific evidence.
</P>
<P>
Last month, some Oxford scientists, writing in the scientific
journal Nature, said that the mad cow disease would decline
naturally and would be over by 2001 without the planned slaughter
of 147,000 cattle.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody should expect snap decisions but it is right to examine
and make sure the policy is correct in the light of new
information we now have. There is no pre-ordained outcome," Major
said.
</P>
<P>
The government ministers are poised to shelve the number of
cattle to be slaughtered and likely to abandon the selective cull
plan altogether, according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
Sir David Naish, President of the National Farmers Union, said
in a BBC Radio interview today that "First of all explore with
Europe all the opportunities and then make a decision. Don't make
a decision based on newspaper reports and scaremongering."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the EU Commission said today in Brussels that a
British program to slaughter cattle most at risk of BSE was an
essential part of an agreement to lift the world-wide ban on
British beef gradually.
</P>
<P>
Gerard Kiely, the EU Agriculture spokesman, told a press
briefing in Brussels, "The selective slaughter plan is an integral
part of the Florence agreement on a step-by-step lifting the
export ban."
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed a global ban on British beef products exports on
March 27 when the British government admitted that there were
possible links between the mad cow disease and its human
equivalent Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease.
</P>
<P>
EU leaders agreed at the Florence in June to gradually lift the
ban on British beef exports on the condition that Britain should
implement a series of tough measures, including the slaughter of
cattle most at risk.

<HEADLINE> Dow Jones Industrial Average Close to Best Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial
average crept toward record levels today as a new report
reinforced optimism that inflation isn't alarming enough to send
interest rates soaring.
</P>
<P>
Trading remained somewhat restrained, however, as investors
braced for some key inflation data later this week.
</P>
<P>
The Dow added about 27.74 points, pulling within 24 points of
its all-time high at 5,778.00, set May 22.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by 6-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, with its volume totaling 375.20 million
shares as against 371.67 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index rose 1.51 to 358.00, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 3.47 to 667.28.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 4.53 to 1,153.96, and the
American Stock Exchange's market value index rose 0.83 to 566.06.
</P>
<P>
But bond prices jumped higher at noon after the Federal Reserve
published the results of its survey on regional business
conditions, which indicated that payrolls are rising in some
areas.
</P>
<P>
After the Fed report, the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond
fell back near late Tuesday's 7.11 percent.
</P>
<P>
The technology sector, still not fully healed from July's
tumbles on a stream of disappointing earnings news, was pressured
by Motorola's warning that its third-quarter profits will fall
short of forecasts.

<HEADLINE> Senior U.S. Officials to Monitor Bosnia Voting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Assistant Secretary
of State John Kornblum, U.S. special mediator on Bosnia, is
leaving Washington this evening for the Balkans to monitor the
voting in Bosnia, the U.S. State Department announced today.
</P>
<P>
The war-torn former Yugoslav republic is going to hold national
elections, designed to reunite the ethnically divided nation, on
September 14.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which brokered a peace agreement to end
Bosnia's nearly four-year war last November, has repeatedly
expressed hope that the Bosnian elections be held smoothly so that
nearly 20,000 American peacekeeping troops could be pulled out of
the country at the end of this as planned.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told a news
briefing here that Kornblum "will be spending Thursday and Friday
in Sarajevo," capital of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"On Saturday he'll be monitoring the voting in Bosnia. And then
on Sunday he'll travel to Belgrade for discussions with (Serbian)
President Slobodan Milosevic," the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Burns disclosed that former U.S. Assistant
Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke will lead a U.S. President's
mission to Bosnia later this week to monitor the elections there.
</P>
<P>
"This is a group of members of the private sector, people from
the private sector, and some government officials who will be
observing the elections on behalf of the president (Clinton)," the
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke, who presided over the peace negotiations of the
Bosnian, Serbian and Croatian presidents in Dayton, Ohio, last
November, was widely regarded as the architect of the Bosnia peace
accord.

LONDON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Oil prices soared today to

<P>
World benchmark Brent Blend crude hit 23.82 US dollars a barrel
today on London's International Petroleum Exchange before easing

<HEADLINE> UK Expects Tough U.S. Response over Iraqi Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The British government, a
strong supporter of U.S. military actions against Iraq, expects a
tough U.S. response after Iraqi military forces launched missile
attacks upon U.S. planes earlier today, according to local press
reports.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that surface-to-air missiles earlier today fired
at two U.S. F-16 jet fighters policing a no-fly zone over northern
Iraq but did not damage the planes.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the latest incident, a British government
official is quoted as saying, " I would expect there to be a firm
reaction and I wouldn't rule out military reaction in the north
Iraq."
</P>
<P>
British officials made it clear that British support for U.S.
policy over Iraq remained firm, saying "we stand shoulder to
shoulder."
</P>
<P>
They also confirmed that if U.S. military planes wanted to use
the British air base on the island of Diego Garcia in the Indian
Ocean as their launching pad again, then permission would have to
be sought from London.

<HEADLINE> Christopher Urges Prompt Ratification of Chemical </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher today urged the U.S. Senate to give a prompt
approval to the global chemical weapons ban treaty signed in 1993.
</P>
<P>
"This convention is of critical importance to the security of
the United States. The threat of chemical weapons, whether in the
hands of governments or terrorists, is one of the most pressing
security challenges we face in the post-Cold war era," Christopher
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
He said that Chemical Weapons Convention "is a crucial tool in
our global fight against chemical weapons proliferation."
</P>
<P>
Noting that the convention has the bipartisan backing,
Christopher urged "prompt ratification" by the
Republican-controlled U.S. Senate to show the U.S. "determination
to defeat the rogue states or terrorists who would use chemical
weapons of mass destruction against us."
</P>
<P>
The treaty, signed by more than 180 countries and regions, will
not go into force until at least 65 signatories formally ratify
it. Only sixty nations have reportedly ratified the convention.
But the United States and Russia, the world's two major chemical
weapon powers, have yet to ratify it.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Turkey to Let in Refugees Quickly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Wednesday urged Turkey to quickly let in those Iraqi refugees who
worked for U.S. agencies in subverting the Iraqi government so
that they could avoid possible retaliations from Saddam
Hussein's forces.
</P>
<P>
"We have a moral obligation," State Department spokesman
Nicholas burns said in calling for an immediate action.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, however, said the Iraqi refugees, who fled the Kurdish
semi-autonomous areas in northern Iraq after an Iraqi-backed
Kurdish faction took control of the areas, would not be allowed
to remain permanently in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The refugees would be allowed into Turkey "for humanitarian
reasons", Turkish Foreign Ministry spokesman Omer Akbel said.
"but just for a transit through Turkey".
</P>
<P>
It appears that negotiations with Turkey to secure temporary
refuge have moved slowly. "We cannot be at all sure their lives
will be protected" against Saddam's security force, Burns said.

<P>
KAMPALA, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni and visiting Pakistani President Farooq Ahmed Khan
Leghari today opened bilateral talks here, during which they
agreed to promote cooperation between their countries.
</P>
<P>
In his remarks at the opening of the talks, President Museveni
said that he is pleased that the present government of Pakistan
has seen it fit to send a high-powered delegation to Uganda
during the visit of President Leghari who began a four-day
visit to Uganda on September 10.

Museveni said that this means the Pakistani leaders see value
in cooperation between Pakistan and Uganda in particular and with
Africa in general.
</P>
<P>
He said that there are many areas where the two
countries can cooperate such as trade, manpower development,
training and many others, adding that Pakistanis are welcome to
invest in Uganda for the mutual benefit of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, President Leghari said that all third
world countries must struggle together to gain their economic
freedom, adding that this will be possible if those countries
engage in South-to-South cooperation, especially in matters of
trade and industry.
</P>
<P>
Leghari reiterated that his country is not only aiming at
maintaining its relations with Uganda but also in enhancing
economic cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that Uganda and Pakistan should also work together not
only to heal the past but to look to the future with confidence
in order to strengthen their cooperation.

WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
hailed the global comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty adopted at
the U.N. General Assembly Tuesday and called on all nations to
sign and ratify it without delay.
</P>

The treaty "was a landmark decision that will strengthen the

proliferation and our ultimate goal of nuclear disarmament," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that this treaty "demonstrates the power of the
international community to unite around a great goal and to act
together to improve the security of all of its members."

WASHINGTON, September 11 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Irish Prime

to move quickly to resolve substantial differences over the fate
of the region.
</P>
<P>
"It is the strong view of my government that the talks must
move beyond procedure and begin soon to discuss substantive
matters," Bruton said in a speech to a joint session of the U.S.
Congress. "This must happen quickly, if we are not to miss the

</P>
<P>
Bruton was the 30th head of state from Europe to speak to a

<P>
The Irish leader noted that his nation was not demanding that
Protestant Unionists in the north break their allegiance to
Britain or that Catholic Nationalists cease their loyalty to
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The way out of the impasse lies in a willingness to share
power, to renounce violence, and to accept differences between
what he called "two minorities" in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Bruton called on the Clinton administration to continue its
efforts to help break the deadlock over the peace talks in
