<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Speaks Highly of Japan's High-Tech Advancement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OSAKA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Li Peng
said here today that he was deeply impressed by the progress Japan
has made in the high-tech area.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with four major Japanese newspapers, Li, who is
on a six-day official good-will visit to Japan, said China has
achieved great progress since he visited Japan eight years
ago. Japan, he said, has also made remarkable progress in the same
period, particularly in the high-tech area.
</P>
<P>
After visiting Tokyo where he held talks with Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto, Li continued his tour of Japan to Nagoya, Osaka
and other cities where he visited several leading Japanese auto
and electronics firms.
</P>
<P>
Li said the warm reception he has received throughout the trip
demonstrates the friendly sentiments of the Japanese people to the
Chinese.
</P>
<P>
At the request of reporters, Li reiterated the explanation made
by Japan on the Japan-U.S. security cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Prime Minister Hashimoto has told me that the new
Japan-U.S. security cooperation guideline is of a defensive
nature, in conformity with the framework of Japan's constitution,
and does not run counter to the basic principles enshrined in the
Sino-Japanese Joint Statement and the Sino-Japanese Treaty of
Peace and Friendship," Li noted.
</P>
<P>
"I understand the explanation made by Prime Minister
Hashimoto," Li said. It would be perfect if Hashimoto would
clarify that such cooperation does not involve or include Taiwan,
he added.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng on China's Financial Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OSAKA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premier Li Peng
said here today that China, for the time being, has no plan to
readjust the exchange rate between the renminbi and the
U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is on a six-day official good-will visit to Japan, made
the remark when asked to comment on the financial crisis in some
regions in the world and its influence on China, particularly Hong
Kong, during an interview with four major Japanese newspapers.
</P>
<P>
Li said China's current financial situation remains stable. The
exchange rate is one U.S. dollar to 8.3 yuan. Therefore, "we have
no plan to make a readjustment," he added.
</P>
<P>
The (financial) situation in Hong Kong, he said, is all right
and the exchange rate between the HK dollar and the U.S. dollar
remains stable, although Hong Kong was struck by the crisis that
began in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
China pursues the "one country, two systems" policy and the
government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is in
charge of economic operations in Hong Kong, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said the central government supports the linked currency
system of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Li said the close link between Hong Kong and the inland areas
and the sustained economic development of the interior areas is
the best support for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of China's attitude on the establishment of the Asian
monetary fund, Li said China is not opposed to discussions on this
matter by experts first. He said Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto holds a similar view.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today fired two senior privatization officials Maxim Boiko and
Pyotr Mostovoi for their involvement in the scandal over high fees
received for writing an as-of-yet unpublished book.
</P>
<P>
Also embroiled in the scandal was the first Deputy Prime
Minister Anatoly Chubais and two other officials, who reportedly
received 90,000 dollars each for writing a book entitled "A
History of Russian Privatization."
</P>
<P>
The authors constitute the bulk of Russia's privatization team.
</P>
<P>
The book involved the authors in the scandal because of
allegations that the payment is a bribe in disguise.
</P>
<P>
Yelstin strongly criticized Chubais' activities as "not
acceptable" but declined his resignation, the Interfax and
ITAR-TASS reported.
</P>
<P>
Chubais conceded Friday the fees were too high and submitted a
resignation to Yeltsin earlier today.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, Yeltsin dismissed his first deputy chief of staff
Alexander Kazakov for involvement in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
The fifth co-author, former privatization chief Alfred Kokh, is
reportedly under investigation.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Foreign Minister Visits Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaiti First Deputy Prime
Minister and Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber
Al-Sabah arrived here this afternoon for a two-day visit to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
The visit is believed to focus on the latest development in the
Gulf region and aim at enlisting Cairo's support in an
international unity against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Upon arrival at the airport, Sabah said that his visit comes
within the framework of continual consultation between the two
countries and between Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmad Al-Sabah
and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that he will deliver a message to Mubarak from the
Kuwaiti emir, but refused to give any details of the message.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt and Syria are our allies... and are indispensable to
us," said the Kuwaiti diplomat, who will also travel to Syria and
Lebanon in a regional tour.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Premier Tariq Aziz is also expected in town today
for talks with the Egyptian leadership in an effort to find a way
out of the current crisis between Baghdad and the U.S. and
U.N. Special Commission monitoring Iraq's weapons destruction.
</P>
<P>
Aziz, due here from Paris, will also visit Tunisia, Libya,
Algeria and Morocco to seek Arab support.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has hoped for tougher sanctions and military strikes
against Iraq, the hostile neighbor whose troops trampled the
small, oil-rich sheikhdom seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Undersecretary for Foreign Affairs Soliman Majed
al-Shaheen told the Middle East News Agency earlier that Sabah's
visit was aimed to discuss the latest developments in the Gulf
region.
</P>
<P>
Sabah will hold talks with the Egyptian side on issues of
mutual concern on the eve of the Gulf Cooperation Council summit
in Kuwait and the Organization of the Islamic Conference summit in
Iranian capital Tehran, Shaheen said.
</P>
<P>
Both the summits are due in December.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Visits Osaka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OSAKA, Japan 15 (Xinhua) -- Governor of Osaka Prefecture of
Japan Nokku Yokoyama pledged today that the prefecture will make
greater contributions to the development of Japan-China friendship
and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
At a banquet held in honor of visiting Chinese Premier Li Peng
here tonight, Yokoyama said economic and cultural exchanges
between Osaka Prefecture and China had started before the
normalization of Japan-China diplomatic ties and thus the
prefecture has been playing the role of a bridge for exchanges
between Japan and China.
</P>
<P>
The prefecture and quite a few cities in the prefecture have
now established ties of friendship and cooperation with various
cities in China and exchanges between them are getting more and
more close with many enterprises in the prefecture now have
cooperation projects in China, said the governor.
</P>
<P>
In his speech at the banquet, Li Peng said great changes had
taken place in the City of Osaka since his last visit to the city
in 1984. The international airport in Osaka, built on a ground
made by filling up part of the sea, shortened the distance of air
travel between Osaka and Shanghai of China, thus facilitating
exchanges between them, said the Chinese premier.
</P>
<P>
Li expressed the hope that the prefecture will continue to play
the role of a bridge in the development of friendship and
cooperation between China and Japan by enlarging cooperation with
China in various fields, particularly in high technology.
</P>
<P>
He said that Matsushita Electric Industrial Co., Ltd in Osaka
showed him quite a few high-tech products during his visit to the
company here this afternoon and that he welcomes other enterprises
in the area to enter into cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that people-to-people exchanges will also
increase apart from exchanges between the governments of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Li came to Osaka this morning from Nagoya in Aichi Prefecture
where he paid a visit to Toyota Motor Corp.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese premier arrived in Tokyo on November 11 for a
six-day official good-will visit to Japan. He is expected to visit
Nara before ending his current trip to the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
OSAKA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese Premire Li Peng
said here today that the recent exchange of visits between leaders
of China, the United States, Russia and Japan is in a sense an
indicator of the acceleration of the world's multipolarization
process.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with four leading Japanese newspapers, Li, who
is on a six-day official good-will visit to Japan, said China
pursues an independent and all-round foreign policy of peace, and
keeps broad contacts with many countries in the world.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question on the possibility of establishing
dialogues between the above-mentioned four nations, Li said many
multilateral dialogue mechanisms have already been established,
some of which play a positive role in international relations.
</P>
<P>
But it is more important to strengthen bilateral ties among
countries, Li said. The development of state-to-state relations
should be based on the basic principles of mutual respect,
equality and mutual benefit, and non-interference in each other's
internal affairs, he added.
</P>
<P>
On the forthcoming international environmental conference
scheduled for December in Kyoto, Li said that China is carrying
out a strategy of sustained development and environmental
protection, which is a basic policy of China.
</P>
<P>
"We have always attached importance to climate changes and
China has always participated actively in the global environment
campaign," the premier said.
</P>
<P>
Li went on to say that the environment is a global issue and
that all countries should work for environmental protection
according to their own conditions. It is unfair and impossible to
apply a unified standard on all countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
It is unreasonable for developed countries to apply their own
standards or even set up restrictions on developing countries, he
added.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the Kyoto conference will make positive progress
through equal consultations," the premier said.
</P>
<P>
In reply to a question concerning the situation in Iraq, Li
said China hopes Iraq will resume cooperation with the United
Nations as soon as possible and fully implement relevant U.N.
resolutions to ensure the U.N. inspection.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the dispute will be settled through peaceful
negotiations rather than resorting to force," Li noted.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Renews Threat to Gun Down U-2 Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf today renewed the threat to shoot down
any U.S. U-2 spy plane overflying Iraq on U.N. arms inspection
missions.
</P>
<P>
"Surely we'll shoot it down" if the surveillance plane resumes
overflight again, al-Sahhaf said while fielding questions from
reporters at a news briefing here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, the foreign minister lashed out at the
U.S. hostile policy against Iraq and its objective to keep the
sanctions in place and use them as a tool to topple President
Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Drawing a line between U.N. and U.S. aims, he claimed the
sanctions, "under the evil guide and leader" of the U.S., are
designed to achieve American objectives rather than compliance of
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He further accused Washington of trying to materialize its
conspiracy to replace the "patriotic political system in Iraq"
with a puppet regime.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq wants a political and diplomatic solution to the
current crisis because it is "the right way" and Iraq will "do its
utmost to see this prevails."
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Deputy Premier Tariq Aziz is due in Cairo, Egypt today as
part of a tour of five northern African Arab countries, which also
include Libya, Algeria, Tunisia and Morocco, in an effort to seek
more Arab support in Iraq's standoff with the U.S. and the
U.N. Special Commission monitoring weapons destruction in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf asked the U.N. to adopt a "fair approach" to the
crisis and give Baghdad a chance for in-depth discussion and
dialogue with the Security Council in the presence of those
related to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
He said the council should listen to Iraq's "just requests and
demands" as part of a mechanism on how to finalize the
U.N. weapons inspection work "fully, fairly and practically" in
order to lift U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Denying that Iraq is preparing for a military confrontation, he
said Baghdad is not on a war footing. He explained that Iraq's gas
rationing taking effect today is a precaution and safety measure
to empty oil tanks and depots to avoid large explosions and
casualties in case of a military strike by the U.S. and its allies.
</P>
<P>
U.S. aircraft carrier George Washington, together with its
combat group, is on the way to the Persian Gulf and will need one
week before joining another carrier USS Nimitz which is already
patrolling there.
</P>
<P>
America's closest ally, Britain, has announced it is sending
aircraft carrier Invincible to the region to reinforce U.S.
military buildup.
</P>
<P>
"It is muscle-flexing within the preparation to lauch an attack
on Iraq," al-Sahhaf pointed out, vowing that Iraq will defend its
security and sovereignty.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat is due to visit India
next week, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Arafat is to discuss with Indian leaders ways
of strengthening economic relations between the PNA and India, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader is expected to solicit help from India
to advance the peace talks between the Palestinians and Israel,
which face an impasse due to Israel's hardline policy.
</P>
<P>
India, operating a representation office in Palestinian
self-rule Gaza Strip, is a consistent supporter of the PNA, to
which it has so far pledged a 2-million-dollar aid package for
long-term economic development projects.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is in Switzerland today to meet with U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright to explore ways to break the stalemate in
the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Warns of Setback in Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said today that the Middle East peace process is now in a blind
alley, and warned of a comeback of violence and destruction in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a joint session of the People's Assembly and the
Shura (Advisory) Council, Mubarak demanded that Israel fully
implement the agreements signed with the Palestinians, especially
the Oslo accords, as an essential step to maintain peace impetus
and prevent a return of war-like atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
"Negotiations and meetings are not an objective in itself, but
a way to reach the essential aim which is to achieve a tangible
progress on the road to peace," said Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
He said that a just and lasting peace is the only means to
maintain regional security and stability.
</P>
<P>
He called upon Israel to abide by its commitments enshrined in
signed agreements and relevant principles to keep the momentum of
the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
He also urged Israel to pave the way for resuming negotiations
on the Lebanese and Syrian tracks and stop obstructing the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak lauded the efforts by all parties concerned, mainly the
United States, the European Union and Russia, to push forward the
Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he called on Arab countries to boost economic
cooperation and implement the resolutions adopted by the Arab
Economic Unity Council in 1964 that call for setting up an Arab
Common Market.
</P>
<P>
He urged Arab countries to join hands in implementing a number
of national projects that will serve Arab economy in general and
boost its collective power to meet challenges.

<HEADLINE> UK Export Level Puzzles City Economists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Economists in the City of
London are puzzled by the resilience of UK's export volumes in the
face of sterling's strength.
</P>
<P>
Despite sterling's appreciation of some 20 percent since August
1996, there has been little reduction in the volume of exports,
according to the latest Inflation Report by the Bank of England.
</P>
<P>
The Bank cited a number of possible explanations including the
use of fixed short-term contracts, slow adjustment of relative
prices and perceptions that the rise in sterling may not last.
</P>
<P>
Foreign exporters may also be raising profit margins rather
than exploiting the boost to their competitiveness by pursuing a
bigger share of the UK market.
</P>
<P>
"As the relatively high value of sterling has persisted since
the August report, some of these factors may start to unwind," the
Bank said.
</P>
<P>
It added that exporters may have been concentrating their
efforts on markets such as the United States, where domestic
demand was stronger and where sterling's appreciation had been
less dramatic.
</P>
<P>
The Bank did not believe exporters could hold out forever.
"With recovery in continental Europe, demand prospects in UK
export markets seem relatively bright, despite the likely fall in
Asian activity," the report said.
</P>
<P>
But UK net exports are still expected to fall further during
the coming quarters, as the effects of sterling's appreciation
continue to feed through, according to the Bank.

The revised law stipulates tougher punishments for narcotics
crimes and allows the use of labor camps to rehabilitate the
offenders.
</P>
<P>
IRNA quoted an authoritative source named as saying that major
offenders - drug dealers and traffickers would be sent to hard
labor camps.
</P>
<P>
Drug addiction is a crime in Iran, but addicts would not be
prosecuted during their rehabilitation period.
</P>
<P>
The new law empowered the Iranian president, who also headed
the anti-narcotics campaign headquarters, to utilize all
facilities at the executive branch's disposal to fight the social
menace.
</P>
<P>
Iran passed the anti-drug law in 1989, under which any drug
trafficker caught with more than 30 grams of heroin or 5,000 grams
of opium would be sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
Official reports said that more than 4,000 drug traffickers had
been executed since the law took effect.
</P>
<P>
During last Iranian calendar year ending March 20, Iran seized
a total of 175 tons of narcotics and arrested 12,000 drug
smugglers.
</P>
<P>
However, drug trafficking is still one of the main, serious
social problems in Iran, which is one of the major transit routes
for drugs destined for Europe from the "Golden Crescent" in the
border areas linking Pakistan and Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Rejects Chubais's Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today turned down the resignation from First Deputy Prime Minister
and finance Minister Anatoly Chubais, the Kremlin press service
said.
</P>
<P>
The president in a telephone call criticized Chubais for being
among the authors of a book on privatization and warned him
against such steps in the future, but rejected the minister's
resignation request.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin did not accept Chubais's resignation because of "an
extremely critical economic situation in Russia".
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Yeltsin sacked two senior officials -- Maxim
Boiko as deputy prime minister and state property minister and
Pyotr Mostovoi as deputy chief of the presidential administration.
</P>
<P>
All these officials, including two others, were among the book
deal. Each of the authors, including Chubais, received 90,000 U.S.
Dollars fee for the unpublished book on privatization in Russia,
thereby stirring up a major political scandal.
</P>
<P>
The press service said Yeltsin had asked the Prosecutor
General's Office for documents on the case and had decided that
the involved in the scandal officials' receipt of such large fees
did not constitute legal offenses but was improper.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin dismissed his staff's first deputy chief Alexander
Kazakov on Friday, who was reportedly also involved in the book
scandal.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Blair Discussing Diplomatic Solution on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
and British Prime Minister Tony Blair have agreed to diplomatic
solutions in pressuring Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to reverse
course in the latest arms inspection crisis, a senior U.S.
official said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, conferring for about 10 minutes with Blair from Air
Force One while in flight from Las Vegas to Sacramento on Saturday,
discussed how to maintain unity on the N.N. Security Council in
"seeking a diplomatic solution" to the arms inspection crisis,
the senior official said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed to contact other leaders over the next
few days in search for a diplomatic solution that would allow a
resumption of the U.N. weapons inspections in Iraq, he said.
</P>
<P>
The official was reluctant to say how long the United States was
willing to pursue a diplomatic solution.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it would be helpful to put a time frame on
it," he said. "We want to do this until there is no hope."

<HEADLINE> German Greens Pledge to Fight for Renewal in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 15 (Xinhua) -- One of the Germany's opposition
parties, the Greens, today pledged to fight for a social and
ecological renewal of the country in the next general elections in
September 1998.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the party congress in the central German city of
Kassel, the Greens' parliamentary group leader, Joschka Fischer
held German Chancellor Helmut Kohl responsible for the political
standstill in Bonn and for the country's record-high unemployment
of about 4.3 million.
</P>
<P>
A fundamental political change in Bonn was only possible with
the participation of the Greens, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Greens has been seeking to join hand with Bonn's main
opposition party, the Social Democratic Party (SPD), to replace
Kohl's centre-right ruling coalition which has been in power since
1982.
</P>
<P>
The two opposition parties in Bonn have managed to form ruling
coalitions in five of Germany's 16 federal states so far.
</P>
<P>
However, in order to achieve the power change in Bonn, Fischer
urged his party to exclude its radical demands, such as the
abolition of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), from
its election platform.
</P>
<P>
Most recent German opinion polls show that if the elections
were held today, Kohl's ruling parties would lose to a coalition
of the SPD and the Greens.

<HEADLINE> Military Actions in Tanzania Refugee Camps Denied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 15 (Xinhua) -- A joint security
mission formed recently by the United Nations and Tanzania to
investigate activities of refugees in their camps in Tanzania has
ended military activities in the camps.
</P>
<P>
The joint security commission was formed by the United Nations
High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) and the Tanzanian government
to investigate allegations by the Tutsi authority that the camps
were being used to train rebels.
</P>
<P>
"There is no militarization in Tanzania refugee camps," said
Vincent Parker, Senior External Relations Officer with UNHCR.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking to journalists Friday in Dar es Salaam at a
press conference where he revealed the findings of the
commission.
</P>
<P>
He said that the mission, which carried out its fact-finding
investigations in the camps last May, did not get proof that the
camps were being used to train Burundi rebels, as claimed by the
Pierre Buyoya's authority, The Guardian reported today.
</P>
<P>
Buyoya's fears are baseless, Parker said.
</P>
<P>
He said the mission noticed increased political activities in
the camps as people were vocal in identifying themselves with
their political parties.
</P>
<P>
Burundi troops have attacked Tanzania twice this year,
claiming that the country was training Burundi rebels in refugee
camps. Tanzania categorically denied these claims and repulsed
both attacks.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the suspension of the exercise to repatriate
Congolese refugees, Parker said consultations were currently
going on between the UNHCR and the governments of Tanzania and
the Democratic Republic of the Congo to facilitate its
resumption.
</P>
<P>
He said developments in the eastern part of the Congo, leading
particularly to lack of security, caused the suspension of the
repatriation exercise.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR is more interested in the welfare of the refugees than
only ferrying them home, said Parker, stressing that the
environment at home should be conducive for their return.
</P>
<P>
He said most of the refugees are willing to go home and engage
themselves in development activities.
</P>
<P>
So far more than 51,400 Congolese refugees, camped in Kigoma
region, have registered themselves for voluntary repatriation, he
said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 7,003 Congolese refugees had been repatriated by
October 27. Some other 13,000 refugees had gone home through
spontaneous repatriation.
</P>
<P>
On the government's special operation launched on September 20
to round up aliens and refugees staying out of their camps, he
said more than 14,304 refugees netted in operation had been sent
to their respective camps. But the operation also led to the
separation of families.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaiti Delegation Leaves for Doha Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The Kuwaiti delegation
left here today for Qatari capital Doha to attend the Middle East
and North Africa (MENA) economic conference, the Kuwaiti News
Agency (KNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, headed by undersecretary of the Finance
Ministry, Abdel Mohsen Al-Hanif, will discuss with other
participants ways to promote commercial activities in the region,
KNA said.
</P>
<P>
The theme of the three-day Doha conference due to open on
Sunday is "creation of new participation for the private and
public sectors for growth of trade and economy after the year
2000."
</P>
<P>
The MENA conference, originally aimed at integrating the
Mideast economy along with progress of the peace process, has
split the Arab world because of the peace crisis since March.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait, Jordan, Oman, Tunisia, Yemen, Comoros and Mauritania
have decided to participate the conference, while Egypt, Saudi
Arabia, Morocco, the United Arab Emirates, Algeria, Syria, Lebanon
and Bahrain preferred to stay away.
</P>
<P>
Those on the boycott front contend that Israel should not be
rewarded with the economic opportunity while the peace process is
deadlocked due to its hardline policy.
</P>
<P>
But Kuwait has argued that attending the conference along with
Israel does not mean it will establish any kind of relations with
the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti Chamber of Commerce and Industry has said it would
not participate in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait at present does not have economic relations with Israel
and has halted the normalization process after Israel broke ground
to build a Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem last March.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 15 (Xinhua) -- While the military junta in
Sierra Leone is rejecting the demand for the disarmament of the
country's armed forces#,preparations are being made to deprive
armed children of their guns in the country.
</P>
<P>
The preparation came to high gear Friday when the junta held
a nationwide workshop on how to identify all child soldiers with
guns in Sierra Leone, prepare the documentation and registration
for their disarmament, demobilization and reintegration into the
society.
</P>
<P>
There are now about 5,000 below the age of 18 with guns in
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The 200 participants in the workshop are supposed to have
acquired skills of how to idenity children with guns before
returning to their respective districts to conduct the
decumentation exercise which is to start the coming Monday.
</P>
<P>
At the end of this exercise, a database will be established
in the Ministry of Social Welfare for the implementation program
to be carried out by international and local agencies including
the Catholic mission and Sierra Leonean Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
The whole exercise will help the authorities to get the right
information needed to speed up the disarmamenet of children with
guns and their reintegration into the society, a senior official
said.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Leader Tries to Boycott Kenyan Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 15 (Xinhua) -- An opposition rally was held
here today to mobilize Kenyans to boycott the General Election to
be held on December 29.
</P>
<P>
Some opposition leaders and thousands of supporters attended
the rally organized by opposition leader Kenneth Matiba to win
support for an election boycott.
</P>
<P>
At the rally, Matiba urged Kenyan religious leaders to take
over the process of constitutional reforms and then hold a fair
election in the East African country.
</P>
<P>
The small turn-out at today's rally was a sharp contrast to
1992 when tens of thousands of opposition supporters brought
Nairobi to a standstill.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government today deployed light security at the
venue of Uhuru Park at the centre of the capital city of Nairobi
and life went on as normal in other parts of the city.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi warned Friday that he would
deal firmly with those people who seek to disrupt the forthcoming
elections.
</P>
<P>
"The government is on standby, ready and willing to deal
firmly and forcefully with individuals or groups seeking to
disrupt the elections", he stated.
</P>
<P>
In 1992 first multi-party elections, Matiba finished runner-up
to Moi with an official poll of 1.5 million against Moi's 1.9
million.
</P>
<P>
Matiba barred himself from contesting the December polls by
refusing to register as a voter.
</P>
<P>
Today he announced that he would launch a new party named
after Saba Saba, giving his supporters a chance to contest for
parliamentary and civic elections.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Urges Iraq to Abide by U.N. Resolutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkish government today
called on Baghdad to abide by the U.N. resolutions in order to
avoid a military confrontation with the United States.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was issued after Turkish Deputy Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit, Defense Minister Ismet Sezgin and other government
and military officials discussed the Iraqi tensions, the Anatolia
News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the current tensions will be defused without use of
force," said a senior government source, who preferred not be
named.
</P>
<P>
"Ankara is at the same time asking all parties concerned to show
utmost restraint," he added.
</P>
<P>
Turkey believes that all diplomatic channels and peaceful means
should be tried, he added.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between Iraq and the U.S. intensified after the Iraqi
government expelled six Americans on U.N. arms inspection teams on
charges of espionage and blocking the lifting of sanctions against
Iraq imposed after its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Washington has threatened that it might take military actions
against Iraq if Baghdad continues to defy the U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the Saturday meeting, Sezgin said
that the U.S. government had not asked for Ankara's permission to
use the Incirlik air base in southern Turkey for possible attacks
on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Parliament will have a final say in the use of the air
base, Sezgin said.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Sets up Committee to Monitor Agro-Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- A national committee to
coordinate and monitor agricultural researches was set up at a
national workshop held at the Mekele University college,
according to a report from the Ethiopian News Agency today.
</P>
<P>
The report said, the national committee which was formed at
the end of a five-day workshop Friday in Mekele, capital city of
the northern Tigray region, is believed to be instrumental in
promoting growth in the agricultural sector through paving the
way for information exchange among research centers, higher
learning institutions and agricultural bureaux of regions.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted workshop organizer Kindeya Gebrehiwoi as
saying that lack of centralism in disseminating research results
by the aforementioned institutions has been a setback to the
contribution they would have made otherwise to the growth in the
agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
The committee comprising seven members is expected to squarely
deal with existing problems, Kindeya added.
</P>
<P>
Over 50 professionals from the Ministry of Agriculture,
regional bureaux, governmental and non-governmental
organizations, and higher learning institutions from Ethiopia as
well as participants from Kenya, Uganda and the Netherlands
attended the workshop.

ADDIS ABABA, Novemebr 15 (Xinhua) -- The Blue Nile Sack
Factory at Debre-Zeit town, 40 kms south-east of Addis Ababa, has
managed to increase its annual production from 6 to 13 million
sacks, a report said here today.
</P>
<P>
Al-amin Nure-Hussien, factory executive director said the
increase is due to an expansion project accomplished at a cost of
1.7 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Measures taken to increase the number of employees and to
equip it with new manufacturing machines have also helped boost
its production, he added.
</P>
<P>
The factory saved 80 percent of the hard currency that the
country used to spend to import sacks, the director said and
added that it has also helped reduce the price of sacks locally.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1986 on 16,000 square meters of land, the
factory produces sacks with the capacity to hold from 10 to 150
kgs of produce.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Vows to Defend Turkish Cypriots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Chief of General Staff
Ismail Hakki Karadayi said today in northern Cyprus that Turkey
will do whatever it can to defend the interests of the Turkish
Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a banquet in Girne, a port city, marking the 14th
anniversary of the founding of "the Turkish Republic of Northern
Cyprus," Karadayi said that Turkey will maintain its military
existence on the eastern Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
Turkey landed its troops on the east Mediterranean island in
1974 and took over the northern third in the wake of a short-lived
pro-Athens coup. The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 the
breakaway Turkish Republic recognized only by Ankara.
</P>
<P>
"We, soliders, are here with our tanks and guns, and there will
be peace," Karadayi said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been split into a Greek Cypriot-controlled south and
a Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 and Turkey has since
maintained 35,000 troops in the northern third.
</P>
<P>
Karadayi expressed Turkey's determination to thwart any threats
to Turkish Cypriots, saying that Turkey's fate is closely related
with that of northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The international community has been making efforts for years
to help reunify the island on bi-zonal and bi-communal basis, but
no tangible progress has been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, some Greek Cypriot protesters tried to enter
the Turkish Cypriot-controlled area, but were barred by police and
the United Nations peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
Four Greek Cypriots and one Turkish Cypriot were killed last
year in bloody clashes along the buffer zone.

<HEADLINE> Writethru: MENA Conference Opens Despite Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DOHA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The controversial Middle East
and North Africa (MENA) Economic Conference opened here today
despite an extensive boycott by Arab countries against Israelis'
participation.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. tried hard to downplay the influence of the
boycott by strongly advocating the philosophy that Arab-Israeli
economic cooperation will boost the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 delegates, mostly businessmen from 66 countries
around the world are attending the conference jointly sponsored
by the U.S. and Russia. Only ten Arab political delegations
are attending the ministerial conference, which was downgraded
from a summit due to the boycott by a dozen Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
This is the strongest boycott the series of MENA annual
conference, which was initiated in 1994 and meant for developing
Arab-Israeli economic links, has ever faced.
</P>
<P>
Without the presence of many Arab partners, the Doha
conference has had to focus strongly on the overall regional
cooperation rather than to give a political incentive to the
Arab-Israeli economic link.
</P>
<P>
In her speech at the opening ceremony, U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright called on all Arab countries to join
the regional economic cooperation, saying such a process is "in
the long-term best interests of this region."
</P>
<P>
She also said "increased commerce and investment will
diminish the mistrust" between governments of the region.
</P>
<P>
But this view is in clash with that by those Arab
countries staying away from the three-day Doha conference. They
said no economic cooperation with Israel is possible without
progress in the peace process, believing that the Doha conference
will undermine Arab's collective economic block against Israel and
thus deprive Arabs of bargaining chips in peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Arabs have divided views over the U.S. thinking as some
countries accepted regional cooperation as an impetus, or an
alternative way to push forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
In his opening address, Qatari Emir Shiekh Hamad Bin
Khalifa al-Thani said the regional economic cooperation "would
ultimately serve the cause of peace and development in the
Middle East and in the interest of its peoples."
</P>
<P>
He said a regional economic cooperation will remain "an
unattainable dream" unless peace is achieved in the region,
but adding that political considerations should not over-ride the
Doha conference.
</P>
<P>
In a move apparently designed to demonstrate U.S. desire to
encourage Arab-Israel cooperation, the signing ceremony of a
Jordan-Israel agreement on establishing an industrial zone was
arranged before the inaugural session of the conference.
</P>
<P>
A Saudi Arabian economist told Xinhua that this conference
is being an American economic show.
</P>
<P>
The Arab countries which sent political delegations are
Jordan, Yemen, Kuwait, Oman, the Comores Islands, Mauritania,
Somalia, Djibouti and Tunisia besides host Qatar. But most of
them are just represented by senior officials.
</P>
<P>
The boycott camp includes Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United
Arab Emirates and Palestine.
</P>
<P>
Some 850 businessmen and investors from the world are also
attending the conference which is convened by the World
Economic Forum.

DOHA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of Gulf

boycott by some Arab states of the fourth Middle East and North
Africa (MENA) Economic Conference is not directed against Qatar.

<P>
Upon his arrival in Doha this morning to attend the opening
session of the conference, Hujailan said this boycott is not
boycott of Qatar as a state, but represents an attitude towards
the conference itself, according to Qatari TV.
</P>
<P>
About a dozen of Arab countries, including Egypt, Syria,
Lebanon, Libya, Algeria, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab
Emirates and Bahrain boycotted the Doha economic conference in
protest against the stalemate in the Middle East peace process
caused by Israeli government's intransigence.

<HEADLINE> Kinkel: WEU Should Enable Joint Crisis Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 16 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel today said that Europe should reshape the Western European
Union (WEU) in such a way that it could enable an effective joint
crisis management in Europe in the future.
</P>
<P>
"Europe must be able to speak with one voice in foreign and
security policies and swiftly and effectively react to crisis
situations. A central role should then be played by the Western
European Union as the military arm of the European Union (EU),"
Kinkel said.
</P>
<P>
"The WEU is the hinge linking the NATO (North Atlantic Treaty
Organization) and the EU. It will enable an effective joint crisis
management in Europe in the future," he added.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel made the statement ahead of a ministerial meeting of the
WEU in the eastern German city of Erfurt on November 17-18.
</P>
<P>
Foreign and defense ministers from 28 European states attending
the meeting are expected to discuss how to transform the WEU,
which was founded in 1948 as a western European defense alliance,
into a pillar within a new European security structure.
</P>
<P>
While Germany and France have been asking for a bigger role for
the WEU, Britain fears that a strengthened WEU would weaken the
NATO.
</P>
<P>
A compromise formula was reached during the EU Amsterdam summit
in June this year, under which the WEU and the EU would cooperate
more closely in the future while the EU would also respect the
duties of member states in the NATO.

Methane is being used by 1,950,000 peasant households in
Sichuan province as the main fuel, accounting for a tenth of the
province's households.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Qatar's Emir Urges U.S. to Push Forward Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DOHA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Emir of Qatar Sheikh Hamad Bin
Khalifa al-Thani today denounced the Israeli intransigent policies
towards the Middle East peace process and called on the United
States to push it forward.
</P>
<P>
This came in a speech by Sheik Hamad at the opening session of
the fourth Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Economic Conference
in Qatari capital Doha.
</P>
<P>
He also called on all peace-loving nations an peoples to do
their best to push forward the peace process in accordance with
the foundations endorsed by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The emir of Qatar expressed worry about the stumbling of the
Middle East peace process because of the intransigence of the
Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli government must realize that its attitudes, as
well as its actions which are contrary to both all the agreements
sign by it and the U.N. resolutions, have undermined the peace
process and exposed the region to a danger of unpredictable
dimensions," said Sheikh Hamad.
</P>
<P>
Sheik Hamad pointed out that peace in the Middle East is facing
the greatest challenge, hoping that the U.N. would play a more
active role in establishing an overall peace and achieving
stability and prosperity in the region.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hamad said he would not like to give a political form to
the Doha economic conference, which is mainly a completion and
continuation of the previous ones held in Casablanca, Amman and
Cairo.
</P>
<P>
About a dozen Arab countries like Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the
United Arab Emirates and the Palestinian National Authority are
staying away from the gathering in protest against the Israeli
hardline policy towards the Mideast peace.
</P>
<P>
He added that the hosting of the conference by Qatar does not
process from its own interests without those of others, and that
the conference is held with the aim of serving the issues of peace
and development in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Hamad said that to create an even-handed base for
economic cooperation in the Middle East would be a reverie without
a fair, overall and lasting peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
The three-day Doha Economic Conference is participated by
delegations from 66 countries, including 10 Arab ones, 850 foreign
businessmen and some 550 Qatari businessmen, with the aim of
discussing ways of regional and international economic
cooperation.

<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Economists attending a recent
seminar on economic and trade cooperation along the Yangtze River
agreed that the Yangtze River Economic belt is emerging as a new

products, including tobacco, steel, coal, oil and cereals, high
technology, real estate and automobiles. Over 5,000 foreign-funded
firms, 38 foreign banks and 81 trade companies from 24 provinces
and cities have established operations in the area.

year.

<HEADLINE> Hainan Effectively Protects Wetlands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The Dongzhaigang Mangrove
Forest Nature Reserve, located in the city of Qiongshan and the
only state wetlands reserve in south China's Hainan Province, is
benefiting from a comprehensive state protection program.
</P>
<P>
The reserve is one of the seven wetlands in the country that
are listed on the register of the International Wetlands
Organization.
</P>
<P>
Wetlands, which are natural ecosystems with various species of
flora and fauna, are noted for their great capacity to purge
sewage and conserve water, according to experts. Wetlands are thus
ideal nature reserves and habitats for many rare species of wild
plants and waterfowl.
</P>
<P>
The reserve, covering about 3,500 hectares, was placed under
state protection in 1986. Since then, the area and breeds of
mangrove forest have been continuously increasing, with more than
2,000 hectares of mangrove forests at present. It amasses 11
families and 18 varieties of mangrove and is the most
well-preserved vegetative cover of its kind in China.
</P>
<P>
The reserve is home to a wide variety of precious plants and
bird species, and is the winter residence for thousands of
migratory birds, according to an official from the local
environmental resources bureau.
</P>
<P>
The city of Qiongshan has established a special committee and
allocated funding to protect the reserve. Local governments at all
levels have also taken part by reminding people to cherish the
natural environment and protect wild animals and plants.
</P>
<P>
The Dongzhaigang Nature Reserve is a national and international
base for scientific research, and also a tourist attraction which
attracts more than 100,000 visitors from home and abroad
annually.

<HEADLINE> Ill-Fated Palestinian Child Laid to Rest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 16 (Xinhua)-- The body of the nine-year-old
Palestinian child Ali Jawarish, who died of rubber bullet wounds
on Saturday, was laid to rest today in his hometown of the West
Bank city of Bethlehem.
</P>
<P>
Around 1,000 Palestinians participated in his funeral during
which anti-Israeli slogans were chanted, the Jerusalem Media and
Communication Center (JMCC) said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, dozens of Palestinian youths stoned the Israeli
military post near Rachel Tomb in Bethlehem and Israeli soldiers
responded by teargasing the youths, it added.
</P>
<P>
Ali was injured by rubber bullets in his forehead fired by
Israeli soldiers on Tuesday in Bethlehem while around 30
Palestinian children between the age of 8 to 12 throwning stones
at the Israeli soldiers in a area near the Rachel Tomb.
</P>
<P>
He was sent to a Jerusalem hospital for treatment but died on
Saturday due to the injuries.
</P>
<P>
Investigation by the Palestinian police has blamed the Israeli
soldiers for causing the death of the child, because they fired
the rubber bullets from a range of only 15 to 50 meters.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian police said the open fire regulations
concerning rubber bullets prohibit their use at a range closer
than 40 meters and these regulations also explicitly prohibit
shooting rubber bullets at children.
</P>
<P>
In the past ten years, 275 Palestinian children under the 16
have been killed by Israeli soldiers, of these 69 were under the
age of 12, Palestinian police said.

<HEADLINE> Industrial Restructuring Brings Hope to Old Northeastern City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The industrial sector in
Changchun, a traditional northeastern China industrial center and
the capital of Jilin Province, began to turn a profit in the third
quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The city's slack economy started to pick up in March. In the
first eight months, industrial enterprises had 2.28 billion yuan
(274 million U.S. dollars) in pre-tax profits, a 30 percent
increase over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
They pocketed a combined net profit of 41 million yuan, 2.2
times the figure of the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Mayor Song Chunhua attributed the achievement to an industrial
restructuring of large and medium-sized state enterprises that
used to be debt-ridden and top heavy with employees.
</P>
<P>
Known as "the Cradle of China's Automotive Industry," Changchun
aims to raise more funds for industrial upgrading by renovating
key state-run companies.
</P>
<P>
Beginning this year, 15 automobile manufacturers have been
undergoing restructuring with 500 million yuan worth of debts
cleared, 15,000 laid-off workers employed, 970 million yuan of
idle state assets reinvested, 960,000 square meters of land and
530,000 square meters of workshops allocated to other uses.
</P>
<P>
Changchun will depend on 30 major enterprises engaged in
producing high-speed trains, cars, tractors and light motorcycles
to increase market share.

WASHINGTON, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- American military and political officials are discovering
that any strategy that relies on bombing raids to change Iraq's
opposition to arms inspection is filed with gambles. Iraq said its
expulsion of American inspectors could not be reversed even by
military attack, and official newspapers and television stations
carried accounts of defiance.
</P>
<P>
-- Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, after talks with
Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat, said she saw some new openings in
the stalled peace talks with Israel and urged both parties "to use
December in a positive way."
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- With the involuntary departure of American weapons
inspectors from Iraq on Friday, the Clinton Administration faces a
pivotal moment in its policy toward Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein.
And for now, at least, none of its options look good.
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton's failure to win over the vast
majority of House Democrats on a crutial trade vote highlights
the broad gulf between Clinton and Democratic lawmakers, a
division that threatens to dash any hopes the president has for
major legislative accomplishment in the final three years of his
presidency.

<HEADLINE> Aircraft Makers Compete for Gulf Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DUBAI, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The world's jet manufacturers
had another chance here today to display on the spot their
latest products to the Gulf region which was believed to be a
tremendous aircraft market.
</P>
<P>
With the opening of the Dubai air show this morning, civil
plane makers were able to fly their flags at the event to fight
for a share of the limelight in the hungry market which was
expected to need thousands of planes by the turn of this century.
</P>
<P>
Military jet providers also got opportunities to become at
the aerospace show an eye-catching exhibitor for buyers,
especially for the host, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), the
biggest customer who is seeking 80 combat planes to beef up its
airforce.
</P>
<P>
Organizers said 500 exhibitors from 31 countries will display
more than 70 planes and introduce maintenance services in the
exhibition village covering an area of more than 30,000 square
meters.
</P>
<P>
Among the exhibitors, aircraft industry giants Boeing and
Airbus Industries are considered to be two tough competitors at
the five-day event, one of the world's three largest after
Britain's Farnborough and the Paris air show.
</P>
<P>
Airbus today introduced its new product A330-220 which is
seen for the first time at a major air show while Boeing joined
the contest with its advanced 777-300.
</P>
<P>
While civil plane makers are fiercely contesting, military
aircraft manufacturers -- including firms from the United States,
Britain, France and Russia -- are also busy in displaying their
latest hardware.
</P>
<P>
Organizers said that apart from big names, the air exhibition
also fielded a substantial number of small and medium suppliers
of a broad scope ranging from aviation maintenance and charter
suppliers. They expected some 30,000 visitors to the air show.

<HEADLINE> Iran Seizes Over 4 Tonnes of Opium </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian security forces
seized over 4,000 kilograms of opium in two separate armed
encounters with the smugglers in northeastern province of Khorasan
in the past three days.
</P>
<P>
According to the Iranian official news agency IRNA today,
commander of provincial security forces Brigadier General Bahram
Noruzi said that 2,075 kilograms of opium were caught in the
border area of Khavaf in an operation.
</P>
<P>
Noruzi said that similar operations were launched by the
security forces in the cities of Torbat Jam, Sarakhs and the
provincial capital Mashhad, seizing 2,000 kilograms of opium from
the smugglers.
</P>
<P>
He said that in these operations three smugglers were
arrested with two vehicles, adding that the estimated value of
the drugs seized was about 2,770 million Rials (about 0.9
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Iran passed a strict anti-drug law in 1989, which empowered
the Iranian authorities to execute any drug trafficker who was
caught with more than 30 grams of heroin or 5,000 grams of
opium.
</P>
<P>
The State Expediency Council ratified an amended law Saturday
to speed up the country's campaign against narcotic-related crimes
by imposing heavy labor punishment for the drug traffickers and
addicts.
</P>
<P>
Iran seized 175 tons of narcotics and arrested 12,000 drug
traffickers during last Iranian calendar year ending March 20,
1997.
</P>
<P>
However, drug trafficking is still one the main social
problems for the Iranian government since the country is one
of the major transit routes for drugs coming from the "Golden
Crescent" on the border area between Pakistan and Afghanistan
destined for Europe.

LONDON, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Sampdoria's Germany striker
Juergen Klinsmann will return to premier league Tottenham Spurs, a
newspaper reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Mail in England said the 33-year-old Klinsmann is ready to
invoke an escape clause in his contract to secure a premature
release from Italian Serie A team Sampdoria.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the German star's return to Spurs would
help him gain the spotlight as Germany decide on its team for the
France World Cup finals next year.
</P>
<P>
Klinsmann originally signed a two-year deal with Spurs after
the 1994 World Cup finals but left for Bayern Munich after one
season. He has scored 29 goals in premier league and cup games in
1994-95 and won the Footballer of the Year award.

<HEADLINE> Iran's Defense Minister Leaves For Visit to UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Defense Minister
Admiral Ali Shamkhani left here for the United Arab Emirates
(UAE) today to attend the international air show in Dubai.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, Shamkhani told the Iranian official
news agency IRNA that he would hold talks with UAE military
officials about military cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He said that exchange of military delegations with the
regional countries would pave the way for expansion of defense
cooperation and boost understanding in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Minister stated that Iran's defense policy is
based on expansion of friendly ties with Islamic countries,
those in the Persian Gulf in particular.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the positive response of the Gulf states
towards the "friendly message" of the Iranian new government,
Shamkhani said the enthusiasm shown by the friendly countries of
the region towards Iran's new initiatives would open bright
prospects for shaping new regional arrangements in the Persian
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi made a
"confidence-building mission" tour to the six Gulf nations last
 week, reiterating Iran's foreign policy of building trust and
seeking friendly cooperation among the regional countries.
</P>
<P>
Following Kharrazi's visit, the UAE Defense Minister Sheikh
Mohammad bin Rashid al-Maktoum Saturday called on the Gulf
states to open talks with Iran to improve ties strained by
territorial disputes.
</P>
<P>
"We in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) should keep the door
of a dialog, understanding and cooperation with Iran open to
preserve our mutual interests and strengthen our historic
relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Iran and the UAE have a dispute over the sovereignty of the
three islands of the Abu Musa, the greater and lesser Tumbs at
the mouth of the Hormoz Strait.
</P>
<P>
Iran took over the islands in 1972 after the British colonist
forces withdrew from the region and reached an agreement with the
UAE to co-rule the islands.
</P>
<P>
However, both the countries claim full sovereignty over the
islands and talks during the past years failed to solve their
dispute.

<P>
TEHRAN, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Secretary
General Kofi Annan will attend the summit of the Organization of
the Islamic Conference (OIC) due to be held here in December, a
U.N. official announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official news agency IRNA quoted head of the
U.N. office in Tehran Micheal Schulenburg as saying that officials
 from the U.N.-affiliated organizations including directors of the
U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF) and the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) would also take part in the OIC summit.
</P>
<P>
Terming that the U.N. and the OIC have close relations with
regular consultations and coordination, Schulenburg said one third
of the U.N. member nations have formed the OIC and officials of
the two organizations hold annual negotiations in Geneva over
major international issues.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the U.N. reform programs, he said discussion in
this respect continues and 51 members out of 185 members of the
U.N. are founding members of the world body, so they would be
given special status once a new reform plan is approved.
</P>
<P>
One should not forget that the U.N. is a very diverse
organization and it is very difficult to get all the countries to
agree on one thing, Schulenburg said, adding that discussions were
continuing in a very positive spirit.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that nations need collective agreements on ways
of solving global issues and to this end a framework is
needed, but the question is how these institutions can be made
more responsive and more effective.

application of high technology and new strains of grain enabled
Anhui to increase its grain output by 1.5 billion kg on 1996.
</P>
<P>
The province introduced high-yield wheat to more than 4.75
million mu, with the per mu output 100 kg higher than that for
ordinary strains. Related efforts contributed greatly to the

<HEADLINE> Albright Criticizes Promise-Breaching in Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DOHA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright today criticized Middle East regional leaders
for not fulfilling their commitment to the peace process, in an
apparently particular reference to Israel.
</P>
<P>
Albright's address to the opening session of the fourth
Middle East and North Africa economic conference here was
interupted by applause for three times when she made remarks
considered as favoring Arabs in the context of the Mideast peace
process as against Israel.
</P>
<P>
She said that "the peace process is in danger....because
leaders have failed to take the actions required to realize the
possibilities of peace."
</P>
<P>
During the past two days, Albright has met Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in London and President of
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Yasser Arafat on resuming
the deadlocked peace process.
</P>
<P>
These meetings have helped bring the parties back to the
negotiation table, she said, describing the talks as serious.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the Israeli-PNA talks had failed to achieve tangible
results following a seven-month stalemate triggered off by
Israeli construction of a Jewish settlement in Arab East
Jerusalem in March.
</P>
<P>
She said her country will continue to play the role of a
honest broker, reiterating that the U.S. objective is to ensure a
comprehensive peace, including the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
This remark won applause from Arab delegations, whose
countries have complained of Washington's biased Mideast policy
in favor of Israel.
</P>
<P>
She called on both Israeli and Palestinian sides to take
measures for reaching agreements on peace.
</P>
<P>
"Palestinian leaders must intensify cooperation on security
and speak more consistently the language of peace," and "Israeli
leaders must meet their responsibilities by taking steps to
restore Palestinian and Arab confidence in their commitment to
implementing Oslo (peace accords)," she said.
</P>
<P>
Albright made an appeal to all Arab countries to join the
regional economic cooperation that involves Israel, saying "it
will be very helpful to the peace process if all the leaders of
this region can keep the commitment they have made."
</P>
<P>
About half of the Arab countries have not sent their
political delegations to the conference in protest against Israeli
hard-line policy towards peace. They also said Arab-Israel
economic cooperation cannot take off unless progress is made in
the peace process.

SHENYANG, November 16 (Xinhua) -- More than four tons of liquor
produced more than 150 years ago was unearthed recently from a
cave in Jinzhou in northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The century-old spirits, made of red sorghum and millet, have

<P>
Chinese wine-making experts and archaeologists agreed that the
yellow-colored drink was made by a special brewery as a tribute to
the palace. The experts said the liquor is safe to drink.
</P>
<P>
The brewery was the predecessor of the present Lingchuan
Brewery, from where the ancient spirit was discovered. The ancient
brew was sealed for safekeeping in 1845.

<HEADLINE> 2ndlead: MENA Conference Opens Despite Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DOHA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The controversial Middle East
and North Africa (MENA) economic conference opened here today
despite an extensive boycott by Arab countries against Israelis'
participation.
</P>
<P>
The opening ceremony was also marked by criticism of Israeli
hard-line policy towards the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,000 delegates, mostly businessmen from 66 countries
around the world, attended the opening ceremony of the three-day
conference.
</P>
<P>
Ten Arab political delegations are attending the conference,
which was downgraded from a summit to ministerial level.
</P>
<P>
About a dozen Arab countries like Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the
United Arab Emirates and the Palestinian National Authority are
staying away from the gathering in protest against the Israeli
hard-line policy towards the Mideast peace.
</P>
<P>
This is the strongest boycott the series of MENA annual
conference, which was initiated in 1994 and meant for developing
Arab-Israeli economic links, has ever faced.
</P>
<P>
In his opening address, Qatari Emir Sheikh Hamad Bin Khalifa
al-Thani noted that the Doha conference is being convened at a
difficult time when Israel's intransigence stalemated the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
He also said that a regional economic cooperation will remain
"an unattainable dream" unless peace is achieved in the region.
</P>
<P>
But he added that political considerations should not
over-ride the Doha conference.
</P>
<P>
Without the presence of many Arab partners, the conference
will have to focus strongly on the overall regional cooperation
rather than to give a political boost to the Arab-Israeli
economic link, observers said.
</P>
<P>
In her speech to the opening session, U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright stressed the significance of the regional
economic cooperation to the peace process, saying such efforts
will be in the long-term best interests of this region.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., a co-sponsor of the Doha conference together with
Russia, has been trying hard to divorce political influence from
the economic conference, while many Arab countries only condition
their business links with Israel on progress in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
But in an apparent reference to Israel, Albright accused some
regional leaders of failing to keep their commitments to peace.

Some 850 businessmen and investors from around the world are

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President Calls for Coexistence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot President Glafcos
Clerides today called for harmonious coexistence for all Cypriots
in a Federal Cyprus Republic.
</P>
<P>
He issued the call in a televised message for the anniversary
of the declaration of a breakaway "the Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus" by Turkish Cypriots in 1983.
</P>
<P>
Turkey is the only country that recognizes the breakaway
state, which the U.N. Security Council described as "legally
invalid."
</P>
<P>
Clerides said in his message that "in doing so it has violated
not only the relevant U.N. resolutions but also the Treaty of
Guarantee under which the three guarantor powers (Britain, Greece
and Turkey) have guaranteed, among other things, the territorial
integrity of the Republic of Cyprus."
</P>
<P>
He believed that a new initiative for a solution to the
Cyprus problem is expected to climax immediately after the
presidential elections next February.
</P>
<P>
"If this initiative succeeds, the Federal Republic of Cyprus
will become a reality which will make the Turkish occupation and
the so-called Turkish Cypriot state a thing of the past,"
Clerides said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that a just solution of the Cyprus problem
will safeguard the unity and security of a demilitarized Federal
Cyprus Republic, where all human rights will be safeguarded.
</P>
<P>
"Such a solution will put an end to the present uncertainty and
will make the harmonious coexistence-existence of all the
legitimate inhabitants of the island a reality," the president
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot South and Turkish
Cypriot North since 1974 when Turkish troops took over the
northern third of the island in the wake of a short-lived Greek
Cypriot coup seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Hungary Holds Referendum on NATO Membership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Hungarians today took to
10,582 polling stations to decide if their country should join the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
Hungarian President Arpad Goncz called the referendum, which
began at 6 a.m. local time (0500 GMT), a "historic chance for
Hungarians to decide their own future."
</P>
<P>
On his part, Prime Minister Gyula Horn said he would consider
it a "major success" if 60-65 percent of the 8 million eligible
voters show up before 7 p.m. (1800 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Its result, expected 11 p.m. (2200 GMT), would be valid if
either the turnout is over 50 percent, or at least 2 million
voters are for or against NATO entry.
</P>
<P>
The referendum was decided in the 1994 general election, when
the Socialists promised to let the people have their say on
joining the Western military alliance.
</P>
<P>
Hungary, the Czech Republic and Poland are expected to become
the first countries from the former Warsaw Pact to be accepted by
an expanded NATO in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Of the three countries, only Hungary chose to hold a referendum
on this matter, although all of its parliamentary parties are
known to prefer the NATO bid.
</P>
<P>
The most prominent groups against the move are the Workers'
Party and Alba Circle, who allege that NATO membership would be
both expensive and unnecessary.

<TEXT>
<P>
OSAKA, Japan, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Olympic and world
champion Cuba Sunday outlasted China 3-2 in a repeat of last
year's Olympic final and remained unbeaten after women's tow
rounds competition at the world volleyball grand champions cup.
</P>
<P>
Cuba rallied from two sets down to score a 9-15, 11-15, 15-7,
15-8, 15-10 victory in the almost two hours play.
</P>
<P>
Two leg injuries on starting seter Zhu Yunying and spiker Wang
Ziling cost China the chance to get its revenge against Cuba for
the Olympic defeat in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
China clincked the first two sets with quick attackings and
better rhythm, which also giving them a 6-3 lead in the third set
when Zhu Yunying twisted her left knee and was sidelined on the
bench.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese pace suddenly sank into a mass after Zhu's injury
while Cuba took the chance to grab seven points in a row and
outscored China 12-1 in the rest of the set.
</P>
<P>
China lost its last chance since Wang Ziling, who socred the
team's third most points of 12, hurt her left ankle when the
Chinese trailed only 9-10 in the deciding set, which applided a
rally-point system in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
"It was always tough to play against China and today we were
little bit lucker to win the match," said Antonio Perdomo, head
coach of Cuba.
</P>
<P>
European champion Russia also kept unbeaten after outsmashing
the tough resisting Japanese squad 3-0 earlier Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The tall and stronger Russian spikers, a 3-0 winner over Asian
champion China on Friday, took a 15-3, 15-7, 27-25 win over the
host.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese girls showed no sign of giving up and surprised
their opponents by jumping to 5-1 and 9-6 lead in the third set.
</P>
<P>
However, Japan with the size disadvantage soon watched its lead
slip away after a ferocious over-block attcking effort by Russia,
who cut the gap to 12-13 when the 25-minute exceeded.
</P>
<P>
According to the new rule introduced in the tournament, when
any of the first four sets is not completed within 25-minute, the
scoring system will be changed from sevice-point to rally-point.
</P>
<P>
The change of rule really thrilled 6,000 young fans at the
OSAKA Jo Hall when the two teams fought neck to neck for the
2-point lead necessary to win the tie-break and the set.
</P>
<P>
Finally, with harder smashes and blocks, Russian held down
Japanese 27-25, the hightest point in a set ever scored since the
tournament started Friday.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's first game, Brazil edged South Korea 16-14 after
the 25-minute rule was applied. The taller Brazilian team then run
away with 15-4, 15-3 in the following sets.
</P>
<P>
"As our national league tournament had just finished, our
players are too tired to meet my demands with their mental
concentration," South Korea coach Kim Hyung-Sil said.
</P>
<P>
The women spikers of the six participating teams will move to
Hiroshima on Monday and play their third round before heading on
to Tokyo for the rest two rounds matches.

<HEADLINE> Child Education Vexing Chinese Urbanites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Children's education has
become a vexatious problem for Chinese urban dwellers, more
pressing than unemployment and the cost of living, a recent survey
has shown.
</P>
<P>
A survey of 1,524 people in the cities of Beijing, Shanghai,
Guangzhou, Xiamen, and Chongqing showed that Chinese are worrying
about education, employment, income, health, their careers, the
performance of their companies, getting laid off, social security,
housing, and the cost of living.
</P>
<P>
But, above 18 percent of those responding said that they worry
about their children's education most, and a third of these are
not satisfied with their children's education.
</P>
<P>
Other parents worry about their children's future and their
behavior. Some think their children are too dependent on their
parents and lack a sense of responsibility.
</P>
<P>
The survey also showed that while workers worry about their
company's future, the managers think their workers suffer from a
lack of enterprise and ability.
</P>
<P>
Half of the respondents say they worry about pensions and
health care for senior citizens.

<HEADLINE> Weekly Review on Bombay Stock Exchange </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Share prices plunged on the
Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) during the week in the wake of heavy
selling pressure by foreign institutional investors which was
induced by fresh speculation of an imminent rupee devaluation.
</P>
<P>
The BSE sensitive index would have fallen further substantially
but for the timely support by financial institutions, who extended
all-round support to arrest downward trend on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The sentiment was affected adversely by the various negative
factors like uncertain political situation in India, unstable
Asian stocks and lack of the government's initiatives for the
revival of the capital market.
</P>
<P>
Foreign institutional investors were selling heavily in several
blue chip scrips in a bid to square off their positions ahead of
the year end in view of these negative factors.
</P>
<P>
The lack of confidence among investors due to persistent fall
in share prices, reflecting a loss of over 536 points in the last
four weeks, was another reason for the depressed conditions.
</P>
<P>
The BSE sensitive index dropped by 177.55 points to end the
week at 3,569.77 as against last weekend close of 3,747.32. The
BSE-100 index also tumbled by 75.18 to close the week at 1,544.03
from previous weekend close of 1,619.21.
</P>
<P>
The BSE-200 and the Dollex were quoted substantially down at
347.16 and 157.36 at the weekend compared with last weekend close
of 364.31 and 165.95 respectively.
</P>
<P>
The volume of business was remained very low at 30.03 billion
rupees (822.7 million U.S. dollars), fractionally down from last
week turnover of 30.63 billion rupees (839.2 million dollars).

<HEADLINE> Nepal Introduces Value Added Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The government of Nepal
today formally introduced the value added tax (VAT) as scheduled
despite strong opposition from the business community.
</P>
<P>
Early in 1993, the VAT system was developed for Nepal by the
United States Agency for International Development and the Harvard
International Industrial Development Institute.
</P>
<P>
A VAT act was passed in Nepal in 1995, which has a provision of
one hundred percent penalty and maximum imprisonment of six months
for those who evade tax by declining to register on the VAT.
</P>
<P>
The government of Nepal favors this tax system, which broadens
the tax net and allows the government to collect more revenues.
</P>
<P>
Nepali newspapers quoted government officials as saying that
the VAT has become both a compulsion to meet the commitment by the
government to the donor agencies for tax reform and a necessity to
increase the contribution of tax revenue which is only about 11
percent of the GDP, one of the lowest in the world.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said another strong reason is the pressing imperative
of liberalizing international trade with tariffs dwindling
worldwide, especially in India, Nepal's major trading partner.
</P>
<P>
But the business community argues that the VAT is inflationary,
encourages smuggling across the border and does not work in a
market like Nepal's where account keeping is very low.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, the two sides held several rounds of
meeting but reached no agreement.
</P>
<P>
The VAT is not an additional tax, but will be levied in place
of the existing sales tax, contract tax, entertainment tax and
hotel tax.
</P>
<P>
The VAT, first introduced in France in 1954, has been adopted
by about 110 countries.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Unfolds Step to Check Illegal Mining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is to set up mineral
mines offices all over the country as a new step to curtail
illegal mining.
</P>
<P>
Anyone caught and proved to be illegal miners would be
prosecuted, said Minister of Solid Minerals Development Alhaji
Kaloma Ali, quoted by the official newspaper New Nigerian today.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria boasts rich mineral resources. Of the 450 proven
minerals including gold, coal, alumimium and iron ore, 33
varieties are ready for exploitation and utilization, according
to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The ministry was established in March 1995 in an effort to
make use of the rich resources.
</P>
<P>
The development of minieral resources is also part of the
government strategy to reduce the country's overdependence on
crude oil, the mainstay industry whose export earns more than 80
percent of the country's foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
But illegal mining has increasingly become an underminer for
the development of the industry.
</P>
<P>
To create an environment for massive investment into the solid
minerals sector, the ministry has reviewed all the laws and
regulations passed during the colonial days to conform with
international standards on mining policies, according to the
minister.
</P>
<P>
The review of the obsolete Minerals Acts, the formation of a
new Nigerian Minerals Policy, the Nigerian minerals appraisals
and monetization programs as well as the ban on importation of
certain minerals were all part of the efforts, he said.
</P>
<P>
Solid minerals whose importation is banned by the government
include gypsum, kaolin and barite.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, the government policy is to produce
as many as possible industrial minerals in the country so that
industries will utilize them.
</P>
<P>
Genuine industrialists would be assisted by giving them
necessary incentives such tax relief, tax holiday etc., he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister
Sheikh Hasina has said that her government had made some
encouraging progress in the telecommunications sector since it was
formed in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina made the statement Saturday when

<P>
She said that the government would soon declare a national
telecommunication policy incorporating provisions for healthy
competition between the public and private sectors to ensure rapid
expansion of modern telecom system and better services to
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the 90-million (about 2 million U.S. dollars)
exchange, the prime minister stated that the ultra-modern
telecommunications was an indispensable tool for the economic
development of the country.
</P>
<P>
With this telephone exchange, not only the telephone
communication would be eased and developed, but it would also
generate new life to the local administration particularly in
times of natural calamity and serve commercial and education
purposes.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that during the past one and half
years, her government gave 160,000 new connections including
147,000 digital phones, and it is spending seven billion taka

the country.
</P>
<P>
Besides, 200 new card phones were installed and new circuits
were added to 822 ISD and 5,116 NWD phones, she added.
</P>
<P>
For rapid expansion of the telecommunication service, her
government had given special thrust on the development of private
sector telecommunication network, she stated, adding that the
government had already given licenses to two rural phone
companies, four mobile cellular phone companies and one paging and
another radio-tracking company in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
During the last 25 year, only 350,000 telephone connections
were given across the country with a population of 120 million
while the present government gave 140,000 new connections all over
the country, according to Post and Telecommunications Minister
Mohammad Nasim.

<HEADLINE> Italian Euro-tax to Be Returned in Tax Credits in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The Euro-tax, a one-off levy
collected earlier this year to ensure Italy's place in the
European economic and monetary union, may be paid back in the form
of a deduction from income tax declarations, the Government said
here today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview on the national radio, Italian Finance Ministry
Undersecretary Fausto Vigevano explained that the pay-back will
correspond to the exact amount received from each tax-payer.
</P>
<P>
Italian Prim Minister Romano Prodi announced Friday that in
1999 tax-payers would get back up to 60 percent of what they paid
in Euro-tax.
</P>
<P>
"The payments made can be considered as tax credits, so when
people declare their income and pay the first tax installment,
they can deduct the amount of Euro-tax they are entitled to get
back," Vigevano said.
</P>
<P>
He added that it was no yet certain whether the Euro-tax would
be paid back via tax declarations in 1999, or via declarations
afterwards concerning income of that year.
</P>
<P>
The Italian government imposed the tax earlier this year as a
measure to help bring public finances into line with the
parameters for the EMU and the singly currency.

France "condemned" the attitude of the Iraqi leaders on the
current crisis as "unacceptable," he said. "There is no way out
for Iraq if it provokes a conflict," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that if Iraq can show the desire to be reintegrated
into the international community and that there is evidence of
such a prospective, then the sanctions against it can be lifted.
</P>
<P>
France's foreign minister had conveyed the message to the
Iraqi leaders, he added.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, Vietnamese Vice President Nguyen Thi Binh
said that the Vietnamese government believed that military actions
or sanctions would not help in resolving the crisis in the gulf.
</P>
<P>
"Vietnam had suffered a longtime of embargoes. We believe that
embargo will only hurt civilians," Nguyen Thi Binh said.

<HEADLINE> 1stlead: MENA Conference Opens Despite Boycott </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DOHA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The controversial Middle East
and North Africa (MENA) economic conference opened here today
despite an extensive boycott by Arab countries against Israelis'
participation.
</P>
<P>
The opening ceremony of the three-day conference was attended
by some 2,000 delegates, mostly businessmen from 66 countries
around the world.
</P>
<P>
Ten Arab political delegations are attending the conference,
which was downgraded from a summit to ministerial level.
</P>
<P>
About a dozen Arab countries like Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the
United Arab Emirates and the Palestinian National Authority are
staying away from the gathering in protest against the Israeli
hard line policy toward the Mideast peace.
</P>
<P>
This is the strongest boycott the series of MENA annual
conference, which was initiated in 1994 and meant for developing
Arab-Israeli economic links, has ever faced.
</P>
<P>
Without the presence of many Arab partners, the conference
will have to focus strongly on the overall regional cooperation
rather than to give a political boost to the Arab-Israeli
economic link, observers said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has tried hard to make the conference a
success. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright attended the
opening ceremony to show support.
</P>
<P>
Some 850 businessmen and investors from around the world are
also attending the conference.

<HEADLINE> Jordan, Israel Agree to Establish Industrial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DOHA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Jordan and Israel signed a
U.S.-backed agreement to establish a joint industrial zone on
the sidelines of the Doha Arab-Israel economic conference which
faces a widespread Arab boycott.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is one of the few Arab countries doing business with
Israel, while many Arab countries are imposing a collective
economic block against Israel in protest against its hardline
policy blamed for bogging down the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The project has been prepared with the full support of the
United States. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
Secretary of Commerce William Daley attended the signing
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
In her speech, Albright described the project as "a model
cooperation (between an Arab country and Israel) for others to
follow."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. holds that the Israel-Arab economic cooperation
serves to boost the stalled Middle East peace process, a stance
favored by the Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Albright also said the project is a "milestone" brought about
by the peace process, adding that "positive result from peace
process still can be felt."
</P>
<P>
The support for the project reflects the U.S. commitment to
the partners in the peace process, she said.
</P>
<P>
The Irbid Qualifying Industrial Zone will cover an area of
200 hectares. The project itself won't cost any investment
input, Israeli Minister of Industry and Trade Natan Sharansky
explained to Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The products in the zone can enter the U.S. market with a
duty-free entry. But this benefit is available to Egypt, Israel
and Jordan only.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Sharansky and his Jordanian
counterpart Hani Moulki. They also expressed the hope that such a
Jordan-Israel cooperation will be expanded to other areas in
the future.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is one of the only two Arab countries which have signed
peace agreements with Israel, and it has reached agreements with
Israel on a number of big projects.
</P>
<P>
An Saudi Arabian economist attending the conference told
Xinhua that Jordan's signing of the industrial zone agreement
would be viewed by many Arabs as an action of "revolt."
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed just before the opening of the
Middle East and North Africa economic conference which is meant
to boost regional economic cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Solid Foundations Laid for Sino-S. African Trade Coop: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Liu Yegang Zhao Yi)
</P>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 16 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese
official said today that the visit by a Chinese trade and
economic delegation to South Africa has achieved positive
achievements and paved the way for further cooperation between
the two countries after the establishment of diplomatic
relations.
</P>
<P>
The 11-day tour is a great success, Shi Guangsheng, head of
the Chinese delegation told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, which ended its visit this morning, met with
South African National Assembly Speaker Frene Ginwala, Foreign
Minister Alfred Nzo and some other cabinet members during its
stay in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Shi said his team also held "in-depth, extensive, fruitful and
constructive" talks with South African Trade and Industry
Minister Alec Erwin.
</P>
<P>
The two countries signed 18 trade and investment contracts and
protocols totaling 630 million U.S. dollars, he said.
</P>
<P>
Shi, who is Deputy Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation, said business circles of the two countries had
established channels of contact and enhanced mutual understanding
through meetings, visits and exchange of views.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade and economic cooperation have been growing at
a rapid speed, Shi said.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade reached 1.35 billion U.S. dollars in 1996 from
a poor base of 14.65 million dollars in 1992.
</P>
<P>
He said China is speeding up investment in South Africa and
more than 50 Chinese enterprises have pumped over 100 million
dollars in the country.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Chinese companies have signed more than 120 labor
contracts in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that there is a great potential and bright
prospects for cooperation in the near future since the two
economies are highly complementary.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to promote practicable economic and trade
cooperation in various manners with South Africa on the basis of
equality and mutual benefit and common development, Shi said.
</P>
<P>
Shi believed that with the normalization of relations, the two
countries will expand cooperation and exchange of visits and
information in the fields of space, aviation, telecommunications,
electronics, mining, metallurgy, energy, agriculture, finance,
transport, tourism and architecture.
</P>
<P>
He said the Chinese government encourages investment in South
Africa and at the same time welcomes South African companies to
make their presence in China.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the confidence that China and South Africa are
surely to be able to establish new trade and economic relaitons
geared to the 21st century after the establishment of diplomatic
relations.
</P>
<P>
South African President Nelson Mandela announced in November
last year that his country would sever "diplomatic ties" with
Taiwan and establish full diplomatic relations with the People's
Republic of China at the end of this year.

<HEADLINE> Australian PM Rules Out Sending Troops to Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The Australian government
today ruled out sending Australian troops to the Middle East as
tensions between Iraq and the United States continued to rise, the
Australian Associated Press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Australian Prime Minister John Howard told reporters in Sydney
today that Australia would not send troops to join American and
British forces in the Middle East while a diplomatic solution to
the crisis was being sought.
</P>
<P>
Howard was quoted by the new agency as describing the situation
as very tense.
</P>
<P>
"(But) I don't think the question of Australian forces'
involvement arises at this time," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer told a local
radio program today that Australia would support military action
if there was no diplomatic solution to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The crisis began last month when Iraq ordered the expulsion of
the U.S. weapons inspectors working for the United Nations on the
ground that the U.S. inspectors are spies, and threatened to fire
on U.S. manned U-2 surveillance aircraft flying over Iraq.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton has reportedly held talks with
British Prime Minister Tony Blair about the question of a military
strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq, meanwhile, has reiterated threats to shoot down any
American U-2 planes that fly over the country.

<HEADLINE> Thousands of Kenyan Flood Victims Face Starvation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 14 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of people in
coastal Kenya's Tana River District, where all villages have
been submerged after the river burst its banks, are faced with
starvation unless they get emergency food supplies.
</P>
<P>
The district has received no supplies of dry foods, fuel or
medicine since the unprecedented rainfall caused by the El Nino
weather phenomenon struck Coast Province a month ago, local
reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Attempts by the Kenyan government to provide flood victims
with food have been hindered by damaged roads and bridges. An
estimated 60,000 people require assistance, said the reports.
</P>
<P>
Most of the affected region could not be accessed either by
road or sea and the helicopters could not land because the area
was flooded, Minister in the Presidential Office John Koech was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the government will try its best to deliver food,
medicine and fuel supplies there, he said after a one-day tour by
a helicopter to the worst-hit Garsen, Hola and Kipini areas in
the district on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Flood waters from the River Tana have covered two-to-three
kilometer stretches from the banks, leaving more than 25,000
people homeless, estimated 10,000 head of livestock dead and
12,000 hectares of rice paddy destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The river is the country's biggest river fed by major
tributaries from Mount Kenya and eastern Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Essential commodities' prices are skyrocketing there, making
it impossible for most people to afford them.
</P>
<P>
A two-kilogram packet of maize flour is selling at 165
Shillings and a kilogram of sugar 185 Shillings. But the normal
prices are 50 and 45 Shillings respectively (around 63.7
Shillings equal to one U.S. Dollar at present ).
</P>
<P>
There are no beans, cooking fat or other essential foods as
they ran out two weeks ago and no new supplies have been brought
in, said the reports.

<P>
MAPUTO, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The epidemic situation of
cholera has been worsening in the Mozambican capital Maputo since
September, local paper "Noticias" reported today.
</P>
<P>
In the past two months, up to 43 people have died of cholera,
and in the recent three days, 120 cholera patients
were admitted into Maputo Center Hospital, the report added.
</P>
<P>
With the number of cholera patients increasing in the capital,
the nursing staff in the hospital could not meet the demand. Thus
Mozambican Minister of Health Aurelio Zilhao has ordered the
closure of the Maputo Institute of Health Science for its
students to nurse cholera patients in Maputo Center Hospital.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to an appeal of the Maputo Bureau of Health, some
retired hospital nurses have reported for duty at concerned
departments to take part in the work of nursing cholera patients,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that neighboring Gaza Province has also
troubled with cholera, with about 40 victims but none of them
dead.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that hot weather, heavy rains, contaminated
water recently have led to the spread of cholera in Maputo and
Gaza Province.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 16 (Xinhua) -- South African companies
investing abroad are switching attention from traditional
locations in Western Europe and North America to Eastern Europe,
South America, Asia-Pacific and Africa, a local daily reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a public survey as saying that many South
African companies are expected to increase their offshore
investments with Africa emerging as a priority region followed by
Asia-Pacific, Western Europe, North America, South America and
Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
The survey was based on responses from 47 companies.
</P>
<P>
"Intended countries for investment are even more diverse than
current investment locations, suggesting movement away from
traditional investment countries such as the UK," said the
survey.
</P>
<P>
Establishing a sales presence in these regions was regarded as
a priority by a quarter of respondents, followed by manufacturing
and mining.
</P>
<P>
The average size of investment financing from South African
sources was more than seven million U.S. Dollars, and from
foreign sources was about 5.2 million Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The strongest motivations for international expansion are to
reach new markets and to become internationally competitive, the

<HEADLINE> India's Inflation Plunges to New Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Continuing its downward
march for the third successive week, India's annual rate of
inflation fell to a new low of 3.23 percent during the week ended
November 1, Press Trust of India said today.
</P>
<P>
In the last three weeks, inflation, based on the wholesale
price index (WPI), has plunged by nearly a percentage point. The
fall, despite recent hikes in prices of petroleum products and
rail freight charges, is being attributed to slackening of demand
in the economy.
</P>
<P>
During the week under review, inflation fell by 0.22 percentage
points to 3.23 percent compared to 3.45 percent in the previous
week and 6.72 percent during the corresponding week last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the WPI for "all commodities" (base 1981-82=100)
declined marginally to 329.6 during the reference week from 329.7
the week before.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Discusses Diplomatic Solution on Iraq With Allies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today telephoned French President Jacques Chirac and the two
agreed on the importance of looking for a diplomatic solution to
the standoff with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who is in California to raise funds for his Democratic
Party, and Chirac, who is visiting Vietnam, spoke for 35 minutes,
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Clinton called British Prime Minister Tony Blair
to discuss the same issue.
</P>
<P>
"President Chirac agreed on the point that the first priority
is to look for a diplomatic solution," Lockhart said, adding that
the two presidents discussed some ideas about how to get U.N. arms
inspections back on track.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added that the conversation was "a constructive
exchange of ideas."
</P>
<P>
"The president is continuing his efforts to work with our
allies to try to forge a diplomatic solution to the current
situation," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Following the conversation between Clinton and Blair, a senior
U.S. official said they have agreed to diplomatic solutions in
pressuring Iraqi President Saddam Hussein to reverse course in the
latest arms inspection crisis.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, conferring for about 10 minutes with Blair from Air
Force One while in flight from Las Vegas to Sacramento, discussed
how to maintain unity on the U.N. Security Council in "seeking a
diplomatic solution" to the arms inspection crisis, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed to contact other leaders over the next
few days in search of a diplomatic solution that would allow a
resumption of the U.N. weapons inspections in Iraq, he said.
</P>
<P>
The official would not say how long the United States was
willing to pursue a diplomatic solution.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think it would be helpful to put a time frame on it,"
he said. "We want to do this until there is no hope."

<HEADLINE> NZ First to Stay in Coalition Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand First Party
has decided to stay within the Coalition Government, meaning it
will support Prime Minister-designate Jenny Shipley.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced by NZ First leader Winston Peters
this afternoon at the last hour of the party's convention in the
South Island city of Christchurch, Radio NZ reported.
</P>
<P>
Peters said he had assurances from coalition partner the
National Party that there would be a continuation of the coalition
direction and agreement.
</P>
<P>
NZ First decision has ensured that the present government will
continue to rule for the next two years.
</P>
<P>
The decision has been widely expected by observers here. They
said NZ First has no other choice but to stay with National.
</P>
<P>
On Friday night, Peters approached Labor Leader Helen Clark on
the possibility of NZ First supporting a Labor minority
government, but the offer was turned down by Clark, who called for
an early election instead.
</P>
<P>
Observers noted that if the coalition collapses now and a snap
election is held, NZ First will be voted out of politics as its
popularity declined rapidly in the past year. With only two
percent support rate at present, it will not be able to pass the
five percent threshold to have listed MPs in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Today's decision has taken NZ First almost two weeks to make
since Shipley replaced Prime Minister Jim Bolger as the National
Party leader early this month. Peters feared that Shipley's tough
matter would endanger his party's standing in the coalition.

<HEADLINE> Bicycle Sector Pedals Way to Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 16 (Xinhua) -- China's bicycle makers can
finally let up on the brakes as sales are gradually recovering
from a low ebb, according to Today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Since 1988, the supply of Chinese bicycles started to outstrip
demand, and the situation lasted until now.
</P>
<P>
Starting in 1991, the relevant government department has worked
out ambitious plans and after years of remoulding, the industrial
structure and product mix of China's bicycle industry was improved
and sales started to pick up.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 28 million bicycles were produced. This was a
decrease of 24.2 percent over the previous year. Of these, 25
million were sold on the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
China's domestic market will take in 30 million bicycles this
year, which represents a seven-percent increase over last year, a
China National Council of Light Industry official said.
</P>
<P>
He said as people's living standards rise, the increase in
bicycle sales in the domestic market hinges largely on people
buying a second bicycle, and the cycle of replacement will become
shorter in the future.
</P>
<P>
A huge potential market for bicycles also exists in the
relatively less developed interior areas and the ever burgeoning
countryside.

<HEADLINE> More Overseas Capital to Be Injected into China's Basic Industries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government will
continue to absorb direct overseas investment and loans to support
new agricultural techniques, energy, transportation, key raw
materials and other basic industries, according to a State
Planning Commission official.
</P>
<P>
Water conservation and environmental protection will take a
prominent position in the country's investment and construction
plans, said Song Mi, director of SPC's Department of Investment.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investment will be an important source to fund China's
infrastructure that promises fast expansion in the next few years,
she was quoted by today's "China Daily" (Business Weekly) as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Overseas capital has been allowed to access most of the
infrastructure and basic industries by way of project financing, a
popular fund-raising method on the international capital market
for a project.
</P>
<P>
The practice is just beginning in China but regarded as a
promising market by overseas investors, Song said.
</P>
<P>
In the coming years, China will focus on comprehensive and
rational development of energy and transportation as well as post
and telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The official added that policies are being discussed to give
preferential tax treatment to infrastructure projects in central
and western areas of the country.

HANOI, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam and Romania signed an
agreement Saturday settling the debt dispute between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Under the Agreement on the Overall Treatment of Vietnam's Debt
to Romania, Vietnam will repay Romania's rouble debt in
U.S. dollars at favorable exchanging rates.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam will also repay the debt by goods.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was hailed as paving the way for further economic
cooperation between the two countries by Vietnam. The amount of
debt was not specified.
</P>
<P>
Prior to 1990, Vietnam borrowed large sums of money in roubles
from the former Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. In
recent years, the repaying process has been hampered by different
views on the exchanging rates of the rouble.

<HEADLINE> Market Access Key to China's Entry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Though China has taken
tremendous pains in the long-running battle to gain accession to
the World Trade Organization (WTO), whether it will soon see its
efforts pay off still hangs in the balance, a senior trade expert
said recently in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The major obstacle to China's entry into WTO still lies with
the market access issues said Xu Xianquan, a researcher with the
Institute of International Trade and Economic Co-operation.
</P>
<P>
On October 1, China slashed tariffs on more than 4,800
commodities, bringing the average tariffs level from 23 percent to
17 percent.
</P>
<P>
And President Jiang Zemin committed to further cutting the
average tariffs to 15 percent by 2000.
</P>
<P>
All these have sufficiently shown China's confidence and
determination to integrate itself into the world market, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless," he said,"some countries are insatiable,
demanding China immediately reduce its tax rate to eight percent.
</P>
<P>
"Many of China's industries are still in infancy," he said,
"Therefore it is reasonable for China to ask for a transition
period."
</P>
<P>
China also has given its word to open more than 30 sideline
industries such as financial service industry, Xu said.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the sincerity China has shown in its actions
to join WTO, some unreasonable and excessive demands are imposed
on it, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-three countries, including the European Union as a
whole, have asked to have bilateral talks with China on Market
access.
</P>
<P>
A new round of WTO talks on China's accession will begin next
month in Geneva.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment Flow Into Ukraine Still Slow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The flow of investment into
Ukraine is still slow and unlikely to rise by the end of the year,
a senior Ukrainian official said today.
</P>
<P>
First Deputy Economy Minister Vasyl Shevchuk said the
government has registered 1,369 foreign investments in the first
ten months of 1997.
</P>
<P>
All these investments amount to 328.8 million U.S. dollars.
This brought per capita investment in the Ukrainian economy to 32
U.S. dollars, or a total of more than 1.6 billion dollars since
independence in 1991. This level of investment is far below
Ukraine's eastern European neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Individual investments in the Ukrainian economy remain
small-scale, Shevchuk said, adding that most investors are
entrepreneurs making small investments for quick profits.

<HEADLINE> China's Life Insurance Sector to Continue Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 16 (Xinhua) -- China's life insurance
industry will continue its strong momentum in the first decade of
the next century since rapid economic growth provides a solid
foundation for further development, a Chinese insurance company
manager predicted.
</P>
<P>
Shi Guoqing, vice-president of People's Insurance (Life) Co. of
China (PICC Life), said the market potential of the country's life
insurance industry will exceed 300 billion yuan ( about 36.1
billion US dollars) with life's share of 150 billion yuan by the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
By 2010, gross premiums will reach 600 billion to 700 billion
yuan, of which 350 billion to 400 billion yuan will have been
obtained by life insurance, compared with 33 billion yuan in 1996,
Shi was quoted by today's "China Daily" (Business Weekly) as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The market will surely create a big cake for domestic and
overseas insurers, but only a few companies could have big bites,
he predicted.
</P>
<P>
"In the next decade, four to five big life insurance companies
will take 75 percent of the total market share," he said.
</P>
<P>
Now, there are nine domestic and overseas-funded life insurance
companies in China.
</P>
<P>
Among the 30.2 billion yuan premium volume in the first half
of this year, PICC Life accounted for 59.57 percent, Ping An 26.11
percent, the Pacific 11.3 percent, New China 1.37 percent and Tai
Kang 1.12 percent.

BEIJING, November 16 (Xinhua) -- The shattering of the State
insurance "iron rice bowl" will not threaten social stability as
feared by some China watchers, a top government official said last
week, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
A basic pension, medical and unemployment insurance system will
be in place by the end of the century, said Wang Jianlun, Chinese
Vice-minister of Labour.
</P>
<P>
China so far has accumulated more than 60 billion yuan pension
funds for urban state-owned businesses' employees, according to
the paper.
</P>
<P>
These businesses are required to set up a personal account for
each of the individual employees which equals to 11 percent of
their salaries. Employees pay four percent of their personal
account and the rest is covered by their employers.
</P>
<P>
China has launched a "re-employment project" to help the
unemployed find new jobs, according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
A diversified medical insurance system has also sheltered
people from the risk of major diseases, she said.
</P>
<P>
Wang will discuss pension fund reform with foreign experts in
Manila next week at an international conference.

<HEADLINE> Russia, Japan Decide to Draft Peace Treaty </HEADLINE>

MOSCOW, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov said today Russia and Japan would "effectively
and positively" implement the agreement reached between the two
countries in Krasnoyarsk, eastern Siberia, early this month.
</P>
<P>
However, Primakov said both sides agreed that no hasty steps
would be taken in addressing thorny issues in bilateral relations,
the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and Japanese
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto decided at an informal summit in
Krasnoyarsk to make utmost efforts to sign a peace treaty by the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Primakov, who returned here Friday after a visit to Japan aimed
at preparing for the Russian-Japanese peace treaty talks, said a
special team consisting of delegates from both sides is expected
to start drafting a peace treaty next January.
</P>
<P>
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin and Japanese
Vice Foreign Minister Muhopy Tamoa will meet in Moscow soon to
decide on the members of the special team, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said that the trust between Russia and Japan is
increasing and both sides have reached agreement on a series of
economic issues and Yeltsin's visit to Japan next April.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Japan have not yet signed a peace treaty for more
than five decades mainly due to a territorial dispute over a chain
of Russian-held islands off northern Japan.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine to Seek U.S. Funds for Chernobyl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Lenoid Kuchma
will start to visit the United States on November 18 in search of
funds for the troubled Chernobyl nuclear power plant, the
Ukrainian News Agency reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
During the three-day visit, Kuchma will hold talks with
U.S. Vice President Al Gore on the problems facing Chernobyl.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference on Friday, Ukrainian Security Secretary
Vladimir Gorbulin described the Chernobyl plant as the world's
only facility of its kind whose status remains vague and
unspecified.
</P>
<P>
The sarcophagus over the No.4 reactor, which exploded in 1986
in the worst nuclear accident in history, still contains about 150
to 210 tons of fissionable fuel.
</P>
<P>
Removal of the fuel poses a major problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Ukraine will have to reprocess the fuel for safe
storage. To make the "Shelter" facility more technically reliable
and environmentally friendly, Ukraine will have to equip it with
sophisticated and costly monitoring devices to watch the physical
processes inside the sarcophagus.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian experts estimate that the renovation project will
cost 750 U.S. dollars. The G-7 group has agreed to give Ukraine
300 million dollars in exchange for the complete shutdown of the
whole plant before 2000.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine itself has also promised to spend about 100 million
dollars to keep the sarcophagus in a proper condition.
</P>
<P>
All of the original four reactors at Chernobyl are shut down
now. No.4 and No.2 reactors ended up in accidents in 1986 and 1992
respectively. The other two have been shut down, one according to
a G-7 group agreement, the other for repair.

STOCKHOLM, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Although Sweden will not be
among the first countries to introduce the single European
currency on January 1, 1999, some of Swedish largest firms are
preparing themselves for the transition, a local press report said
today.
</P>
<P>
"Customers in countries where the single currency has been
introduced will ask to be billed in euros, and we will accommodate
them," said Lars G. Malmer, spokesman for Sweden's bearing
manufacturer SKF.
</P>
<P>
"We see the euro as an opportunity to create a common financial
language in the group," said Kerstin Rendahl from a forestry firm,
Stora. Rendahl is in charge of the company's single currency
policy.
</P>
<P>
Several other firms also noted that investors will want
corporate reports in the European currency if the Stockholm
Exchange decides to record stock prices in euros in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we will present an abbreviated version of our
annual report for 1999 in the euro, while the full-length report
will still be in Swedish krona," said Ann Westergren Ekstedt, who
is responsible for coordinating the single currency project in
Ericsson, one of Sweden's major oil company.

<HEADLINE> Brazil's International Reserves Go Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's international
reserves dropped 9.3 billion U.S. dollars from 62.1 billion to
52.8 billion dollars by the end of October, the Central Bank said
today.
</P>
<P>
It was the lowest record of the country's international
reserves since January 1996.
</P>
<P>
By the end of September, the reserves totaled 61.1 billion
dollars, and by October 15 they rose to 62.1 billion dollars, but
quickly declined to 52.8 billion dollars by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
The bank attributed the sharp drop within less than 15 days to
the country's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
On October 28-30, the Central Bank had to hold 11 auctions of
dollars to contain the crisis and prevent a devaluation of the
national currency, the real.
</P>
<P>
Also in October, the government spent more than 1.2 billion
dollars in the repayment of foreign debt, the bank said.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, November 16 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing, a
newly-designated municipality with a population of 30 million,
received about 200,000 overseas tourists in the first nine months
of this year, surpassing the record high in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Chongqing handled over 160,000 overseas tourists,
and earned about 100 million US dollars from international
tourism. The arrival of domestic tourists amounted to 16 million
and the earnings stood at 5.55 billion yuan (about 668 million US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Chongqing was separated from Sichuan Province to became China's
fourth municipality under direct administration of the central
government in March. Officials say the change can be attributed
partly to the growing tourist interest in the area.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the rise in tourism is that increasing
number of visitors who flocked to see the Three Gorges of the
Yangtze River, where the world's largest hydro-electric Power
project is being built.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing now has 48 hotels catering to overseas tourists,
including 14 star-rated hotels, and 134 travel agencies.

<HEADLINE> Belgian Eleven Qualify for World Cup Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Goals from Luis Oliveira and
Luc Nilis today lifted Belgium to join Yugoslavia, Croatia and
Italy as the last European teams to qualify for next year's World
Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
The Belgians won on an aggregate of 3-2.
</P>
<P>
With a 1-1 away game at hand, the Belgian Red Demons sealed
the return leg of the two-game playoff in a match that saw
jitters in the opening 15 minutes and chilly rains in more than
40 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Oliveira, who did not play in Dublin on October 11, beat an
offside trap at the 24th minute and the Belgian striker sped off
an Irish defender before beating the opposing goalkeeper to the
goal for the morale-boosting opener.
</P>
<P>
The striker then created a freekick just outside the Irish
penalty area after he was brought down during another solo run
for the goal.
</P>
<P>
Nilis, who was on target in Dublin for the Belgians, lobbed
the freekick just over the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
But a 68th-minute tie-breaking winner made Nilis the toast of
a capacity crowd at the Heysel Stadium. The playmaker resorted
to a smart fake maneuver to run away from two defenders inside
the penalty box and chipped in a neat pass from left.
</P>
<P>
Substitute Ray Houghton once tied the game for the visitors
and rekindled the hope of Irish quanlifying for the cup finale.
He headed in an endline cross for a 58th-minute equalizer.
</P>
<P>
The Irish squandered several of their scoring chances.
</P>
<P>
Gary Kelly's grazing shot from close range went just on the
wrong side of the right Belgian goal post six minutes upon
resumption.
</P>
<P>
At one time both sides played a little tough and the referee
had to fish out a couple of yellow cards before sending off
Ireland's David Conolly at the 81st minute for foul tackle a
second time in the game.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the other European playoff games, Predrag
Mijatovic celebrated a scoring spree with four goals in a 5-0
trouncing over Hungary in Belgrade. The Real Madrid striker
scored a hat-trick in the away game for a 7-1 win in Budapest.
Yugoslavia scored 12 goals in all and conceded one goal in the
two games.
</P>
<P>
A 27th-minute goal by Alen Boksic sent Croatia to its first
ever World Cup final. Croatia held hosts Ukraine for a
one-goal-each draw and a 3-1 winning aggregate.
</P>
<P>
Pierluigi Casiraghi scored Italy's lone goal in a hard-fought
game against visiting Russia. But the lone goal was enough to
secure Italy a berth in France. The Italians pinned hosts Russia
down to a 1-1 tie in the first leg on October 11 in a snowstorm.

Stojkovic's cross after Savo Milosevic took their lead in the 17th
minute on Stojkovic's free kick.

Mijatovic again converted a penalty one minute later and
completed his hat-trick in the 71st minute, finishing outstanding
efforts from Stojkovic and Dejan Savicevic.

<P>
WARSAW, November 8 (Xinhua) -- Polish President Aleksander
Kwasniewski left here today to begin a state visit to China, which
he hopes will help strengthen economic relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
During the five-day visit, the first by a Polish head of state
since 1959, Kwasniewski is scheduled to meet Chinese leaders to
discuss bilateral relations and international issues of common
concern.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Chinese reporters on the eve of his visit,
Kwasniewski said his visit would be a new beginning in the history
of Sino-Polish relations and would give a great hope for the
development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He said he would "take full advantage of the visit" and
"enhance dialogue and cooperation with China."
</P>
<P>
The potential of the Sino-Polish relationship, especially that
of economic cooperation has not been fully tapped, he said, adding
that time is ripe now to fully tap such potential.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Poland and China used to share a good tradition of
economic cooperation, the president said that in recent years,
such cooperation was weakened for various reasons. Now, he said,
the two countries should explore new ways of cooperation by
strengthening exchanges and mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
He also said the two countries should strengthen dialogue, not
only at the central government level, but also at the level of
local governments.
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski said Poland highly valued the role China plays on
the international stage. As Poland also plays its appropriate role
in world affairs, it will benefit both Poland and China to have
good cooperation in international politics, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he visited China in 1988 as the minister of youths
and sports of the former government. He made a private visit to
China in 1989.

<HEADLINE> Kwasniewski Left Warsaw to Start China Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Polish President Aleksander
Kwasniewski left here today to begin a state visit to China, which
he hopes will help strengthen economic relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
During the five-day visit, the first by a Polish head of state
since 1959, Kwasniewski is scheduled to meet Chinese leaders to
discuss bilateral relations and international issues of common
concern.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Chinese reporters on the eve of his visit,
Kwasniewski said his visit would be a new beginning in the history
of Sino-Polish relations and would give a great hope for the
development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He said he would "take full advantage of the visit" and
"enhance dialogue and cooperation with China."
</P>
<P>
The potential of the Sino-Polish relationship, especially that
of economic cooperation has not been fully tapped, he said, adding
that time is ripe now to fully tap such potential.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Poland and China used to share a good tradition of
economic cooperation, the president said that in recent years,
such cooperation was weakened for various reasons. Now, he said,
the two countries should explore new ways of cooperation by
strengthening exchanges and mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
He also said the two countries should strengthen dialogue, not
only at the central government level, but also at the level of
local governments.
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski said Poland highly valued the role China plays on
the international stage. As Poland also plays its appropriate role
in world affairs, it will benefit both Poland and China to have
good cooperation in international politics, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he visited China in 1988 as the minister of youths
and sports of the former government. He made a private visit to
China in 1989.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Banking Industry in Good Shape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 15 (Xinhua) -- The robust economy has
ensured strong loan demand thus giving an impetus to the banking
industry in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Income of the nation's 71 "superregional" banks from lending
rose 15 percent to 144 billion U.S. dollars in 1996 while their
noninterest income from bank accounts, asset management and
trading profits grew 28 percent, local newspaper Investor's
Business Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Low inflation and stable interests are among the factors
contributing to the sustained growth of the banking industry.
</P>
<P>
The American Bankers Association considers banks with assets of
more than 10 billion dollars as superregionals who own a combined
assets of 2.25 trillion dollars.
</P>
<P>
They are not in the rank of the country's "big ten" banks whose
assets totaling 2 trillion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The superregionals' assents have been expanding since 1991 with
1996 recording a 20 percent increase. The growth prospect for this
year was set for 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The superregionals' main markets include home, consumer and
middle-market business loans, credit cards, and checking and
savings.
</P>
<P>
The banking industry is also featured by merger and
acquisition, the latest case being the 15.5 billion dollar
acquisition of Florida's Barnett Banks by North Carolina's
NationsBank Corp..
</P>
<P>
Banks not only merge businesses of the same line, but also
other financial firms like brokers. Today's superregionals cover
also consumer loans, investing, trust, brokerage and underwriting.
</P>
<P>
As the nation's economy shows no sign of slowing, and baby
boomers are saving for education of their next generations and
their own retirement, banks are poised for growth if they know
enough how to manage risks, analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Survey Shows Violent Crime Drop in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 15 (Xinhua) -- Violent crimes fell 10
percent in 1996 in the United States, says an annual U.S. Justice
Department survey of victims released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The overall victimization rates from all crimes were at their
lowest level since the survey of victims began 23 years ago, the
survey said,
</P>
<P>
The 1996 violent crime rate against victims was down 16 percent
from 1993. Property crime was down 8 percent last year, and was 17
percent lower than 1993.
</P>
<P>
Other crimes against persons, including rape, attempted rape,
other sexual assaults and aggravated assaults, also were down
dramatically during the 1993-96 period.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, household burglary, motor vehicle theft, personal
theft such as purse snatching fell 19 percent, 29 percent, 35
percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
There were an estimated 2.7 million "completed'' violent crimes
in 1996, for a rate of 12.4 per 1,000 U.S. residents 12 years or
older. In contrast, there were 3 million in 1995, a rate of 13.8.
</P>
<P>
Property crimes and attempts dropped from 29.5 million, or 291
per 1000 households, to 27.4 million, or 266 per 1000 households.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Justice Statistics says the victims' survey is in
general agreement with the FBI figures released last September.
