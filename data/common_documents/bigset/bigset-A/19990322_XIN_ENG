<HEADLINE> Italy's Prodi May Fill Vacuum of EU Executive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) leaders will
find rapid solution to agree on a new head of the European
Commission, the EU executive body, after former Italian prime
minister emerged as an obvious frontrunner to succeed Jacques
Santer, the outgoing commission president.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers of the 15 EU member states, at a meeting here
on Sunday, are discussing the crisis caused by the sudden
resignation of the EU executive early this week in the wake of a
probe report on fraud and nepotism in the EU bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
The crisis will be on top agenda of a EU summit meeting in
Berlin next week although German Chancellor Gerhard Shroeder has
said it is not clear if the meeting will be able to agree on a
successor to outgoing Santer. "All Colleagues quickly want to
reach a good solution," Schroeder said in Brussels on Friday as he
neared the end of an exhausting tour of EU capitals to prepare for
the summit.
</P>
<P>
Actually, current EU president Germany's goal at the summit is
to broker a long-sought agreement on reforming the EU's farm and
regional aid budget. If no agreement on a commission president is
reached in Berlin, a special summit could be held soon after.
</P>
<P>
So far, Prodi is the only officially declared candidate to be
next president of the commission, which is responsible for
drafting and implementing EU legislation. Now, most of those seen
as potential candidates have been ruled out of the race.
</P>
<P>
Prodi announced on Friday he was willing to become the EU
executive head if he received a full, unconditional mandate backed
by all 15 EU member states. He also made clear that he wanted a
five-year term, but not just to serve out the remainder of the
current term which expires in January.
</P>
<P>
He has won favorable comment from Schroeder and British Prime
Minister Tony Blair. Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene also
said Prodi would be a good candidate and that he shared Belgium's
vision of Europe.
</P>
<P>
Former Spanish Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has also been
mentioned by some backers. While NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana was too busy with the Kosovo crisis to be thinking of a new
job, a NATO official said. Portugese Prime Minister Antonio
Guterres said his political commitments made it impossible for him
to seek the post.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok has said he wants to
stay in his current post, and that he would like to see a
candidate from southern Europe.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Flowers Make Islamabad More Beautiful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Under a sunny sky dotted with
colorful kites, gorgeous flowers and children chasing each other
merrily were a beautiful scene of spring on Sunday at the Rose and
Jasmine Garden in this capital city.
</P>
<P>
The 17th Spring Flower Show, which opened on Friday in
Islamabad -- a city well known for its great variety of flowers --
provided a chance for nature-lovers to witness the floriculture of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-six categories of flowers, including violets, carnation,
iris, tulips, daffodils, dahlia, lilies, marigolds, catcus, were
on display, attracting numerous visitors.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Sajjad Ahmad, finance secretary of Islamabad Horticultural
Society (IHS), the show's organizer, said the annual flower show
has drawn many organizations and individuals since 1983.
</P>
<P>
Another annual show will be held in September when roses and
chrysanthemums will be on display.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistan International Airlines, the Capital Development
Authority, Pakistan Horticultural Society and some foreign
embassies are among the 74 participants who set up their stalls
this spring.
</P>
<P>
The three-day show has attracted some 50,000 visitors, said
Ahmad.
</P>
<P>
"They are all truly beautiful," said Abdul Hamed, 56, pointing
to layouts of flower mounts and flower carpets.
</P>
<P>
Hamed, a garden contractor, said he visited the show every day
to "just enjoy the beauty of flowers."
</P>
<P>
Prizes were awarded by the organizer to those participants who
provided the best flowers and layouts.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Shahnaz Ejaz, who runs a small flower shop, was excited to
know she will win the first prize among the individual
participants.
</P>
<P>
"I have been awarded all kinds of prizes for my flowers for
more than 15 times," she said with jubilation, "I am very very
happy with my job, because it can make others happy and the
capital more beautiful."

<TEXT>
<P>
PRISTINA, Kosovo, Yugoslavia, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Separatists
repeatedly fired sniper shots at patrolling police early on Sunday
in Kosovo, the Pristina Media Center said.
</P>
<P>
The government-run information center quoted the Pristina
police command as saying that the police patrol cars were shot at
along the Pristina-Podujevo highway, where the police had to block
the traffic for safety reasons.
</P>
<P>
The police did not report any casualties on its side.
</P>
<P>
Separatists armed with sniper rifles also harassed patrolling
police near Srbica, to the northwest of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
The Pristina-Podujevo highway is the main road leading up to
Belgrade in the Serbian republic.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations World Food Program (WFP) and the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees continued their
humanitarian aid work on Sunday by delivering food to displaced
people in the surrounding areas of Pristina.
</P>
<P>
The WFP has been delivering food to displaced people in Kosovo
since last June and its Pristina office estimated that the
displaced may number 235,000.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Pledges to Intensify Efforts on Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton has
pledged to intensify efforts to resolve the Cyprus issue by
convincing all parties involved to come to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus News Agency reported Sunday that in a letter to
Rhode Island Senator, Leonidas Raptakis, Clinton said he is
committed to finding a solution to the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Clinton was replying to a letter from the U.S. senator
informing him of the creation of the Hellenic-American Coalition
of New England.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he shared with Raptakis on the "concern that there
has not been more progress towards a peaceful resolution of the
Cyprus conflict."
</P>
<P>
He added that the U.S. administration will "intensify its
efforts to convince all parties that negotiations are the only
way to resolve this 'communal conflict' and build a future of
peace and prosperity for all Cypriots."
</P>
<P>
Raptakis said he will "work closely" with members of the
coalition to encourage the Clinton administration and Congress to
"address this long-standing problem."
</P>
<P>
The coalition, joined by Greek-American elected officials, is
intended to promote awareness and provide information on issues
concerning Cyprus and Greece.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish
troops invaded and controlled the northern third of the island in
the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island,
but so far no tangible results have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Four-time Champion Dalian Stunned in Opening Round </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The new season of the Chinese
professional soccer league kicked off on Sunday as newly-promoted
Liaoning Fushun made the headlines by upsetting four-time champion
Dalian Wanda 1-0.
</P>
<P>
The goal from Qu Shengqing in the 49th minute put an end to
Dalian's five-year unbeaten streak at home and also attested that
Wanda is no longer invincible both away and home.
</P>
<P>
Dalian seemed in a slump form throughout and gave the visitors
quite a few chances. But the Liaoning side, a dominant force in
the 1980s who suffered a relegation to the second division in 1995,
failed to further widen the gap.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Shenhua, runners-up last season and champion in 1995,
was held to a goalless draw at home by Tianjin Taida. Zhang Jilong,
vice president of the Chinese Football Association, declared the
opening of the season before the game.
</P>
<P>
In other games, Chongqing Longxin drew with Wuhan 1-1, Songri
lost to Jilin Aodong 1-0 in Guiyang, Shenzhen Ping'an tied Beijing
Guo'an 0-0, Shandong Taishan beat hosts Qingdao Hainiu 2-1 for the
first time since 1995 and Shenyang Haishi fought to a goalless
draw with Sichuan Quanxing.
</P>
<P>
After the game, Wanda's head coach Xu Genbao left the field
amid the jeers of home crowd, who demanded him to quit immediately.
</P>
<P>
"I have never thought of quitting," the 54-year-old Xu said. "
But if my resignation could give Wanda a boost, I would resign."
</P>
<P>
Xu, a former national head coach, attributed the loss to their
poor defense, which he said had given the opponents too many
chances to score.
</P>
<P>
"But I think our players have displayed good team work," said
Xu, who had also coached the national Olympic side but failed to
qualify for the 1992 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"I had expected that the fans would urge me to resign after the
match," he said. "But I have met such crises for several times, I
think I can weather through this one."
</P>
<P>
Xu said that if the club had two good foreign players, the
situation could have been better.
</P>
<P>
The club is still looking for foreign players, hoping they
could save Wanda from a possible decline, said Xu, who took over
as the coach midway last season.
</P>
<P>
"We began to look for new foreign players as early as this year
and have spent much more time on this than ever, but so far we
have not found ideal players.
</P>
<P>
"I must admit that there were loopholes in our work. But on the
other hand, that's because we are not as lucky as before," he said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Special Envoy Holds Talks With Afghan Taliban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 21 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Special Envoy on
Afghanistan Lakhdar Brahimi held discussions Sunday in Kabul with
the Afghan Taliban militia on the Ashgabad talks and the security
of U.N. staff.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi, who arrived in the Afghan capital earlier in the day
for a flying visit, held talks with Mullah Mohammad Rabbani, head
of the Taliban interim council, according to U.N. sources.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Brahimi welcomed the agreement between the
Taliban and the opposition and described it as a landmark
achievement towards the goal of durable peace in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban and the opposition reached the agreement during
their talks on March 11-14 in Ashgabad, Turkmenistan. The accord
says the two sides have agreed to form a shared government.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi also briefed Rabbani about his meetings with officials
of Pakistan, Iran and Central Asian countries during the past few
weeks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the envoy renewed the U.N. offer to provide premises
for the next Taliban-opposition meeting inside Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban leader asked Brahimi to expedite the return of U.N.
international staff to Afghanistan, as was announced by the U.N.
</P>
<P>
"The talks with Brahimi were constructive. We have not only
renewed full security to the U.N. staff on return to Afghanistan
but will also facilitate them to smoothly continue their
activities," a Taliban source said here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
This was the second visit to Afghanistan by the U.N. envoy in
less than a month and the first after the Ashgabad agreement
between the Taliban and the opposition.
</P>
<P>
Brahimi is expected soon to convene a meeting of the so-called
Six Plus Two group of Afghanistan's immediate neighbors plus
Russia and the United States to review scant progress towards
Afghan peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, India to Exchange Prisoners on Monday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and India will
exchange prisoners at the Wagha border on Monday as a follow-up of
talks between Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his Indian
counterpart Atal Bihari Vajpayee in Lahore last month.
</P>
<P>
"The decision to release the prisoners has been taken on
humanitarian grounds," said a press statement issued Sunday by the
Interior Ministry of Pakistan in Lahore, provincial capital of
Punjab.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first exchange of prisoners between the two
countries since 1991 and details of the exchange were finalized by
the official delegations of the two countries in Islamabad earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Pakistan will hand over 15 Indian prisoners to
Indian officials at the Wagha border, 22 km east of Lahore, while
India will release 43 Pakistani prisoners, according to the press
statement.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Interior Minister Shujaat Hussain said there are a
large number of prisoners of either country presently languishing
in one other's jails despite the expiry of their jail terms on
minor offenses.
</P>
<P>
He said the two countries had also agreed to release fishermen
who inadvertently crossed over to each other's waters.
</P>
<P>
In a month's time, Pakistan will release 109 Indian fishermen
and 17 of their boats, while India will free 26 Pakistani
fishermen and 3 Pakistani vessels, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
Hussain said that under an agreement, Pakistan and India will
exchange information on arrested nationals of each other.
</P>
<P>
To create a congenial atmosphere between the two countries
following the Lahore Declaration jointly issued by Sharif and
Vajpayee, it has been decided to solve problems of civilian
prisoners on humanitarian grounds.
</P>
<P>
"The prime ministers of both countries have agreed to
facilitate more contacts between the separated families and
prisoners, and for this purpose the procedure of interviews with
prisoners is being simplified," said Hussain.

BRUSSELS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) is fully ready to take military action in
Kosovo in next few hours, a NATO spokesman said here on Sunday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> 6 Lebanese Sentenced to Death for Aiding Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Six Lebanese have been sentenced
to death by a Lebanese court for visiting Israel or providing
information to Israeli forces, the official National News Agency
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Beirut military court Saturday convicted the six of
contacting with Israel and its proxy South Lebanon Army (SLA),
providing information about activities of Lebanese and Syrian
army in Lebanon to the Jewish state, entering Israel without the
government's permit.
</P>
<P>
The court also sentenced 15 others to varying jail terms with
the similar charges.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Holbrooke Sent to Deliver Final Threat to Milosevic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. special envoy Richard
Holbrooke is being sent to Yugoslavia to deliver a final warning
to Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic for looming airstrikes by
NATO forces, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"Ambassador Holbrooke will emphasize to President Milosevic
that NATO airstrikes against the FRY (Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia) are being prepared," Albright said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Albright made clear that Holbrooke's mission was a last-ditch
chance for Yugoslavia to avert a military attack.
</P>
<P>
"He will make clear that Milosevic faces a stark choice: to
halt aggression against the Kosovar Albanians and accept an
interim settlement with a NATO-led implementation force or bear
the full responsibility for the consequences of NATO military
action," Albright said.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke, whose last meeting with Milosevic a week and a
half ago ended without any commitments, also planned to stop on
Monday in Brussels, Belgium to meet with NATO Secretary General
Javier Solana, a State Department official said.

<HEADLINE> Appeal Against Extradition Ruling Rejected in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Supreme Court on Sunday
 rejected a request to hear an appeal against a decision not to
extradite a teenager suspected of being involved in a murder in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Shlomo Levine, deputy chief justice of the court, said that
the issue is of great importance and there is no room for an
additional hearing.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said that Levine's decision paved the way for the
trial in Israel of Samuel Sheinbein, who fled to Israel three days
after the body of an acquaintance of his was found in Maryland in
September 1997.
</P>
<P>
Sheinbein was born and raised in the United States; but as his
father was born in Israel and holds an Israeli passport, he is
recognized by Israel as its citizen.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Supreme Court ruled last month that Sheinbein, 18, was
an Israeli citizen and could not be extradited to the U.S.. Israel
passed the law banning extradition of Israeli citizens in 1978.
</P>
<P>
The ruling draw harsh criticism from U.S. law enforcement
official and also infuriated the victim's family. And the case
could raised tensions between Israel and the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Following the ruling, Israeli Attorney General Elyakim
Rubinstein lodged an appeal, asking the court to consider to
convene an expanded bench to reconsider the case.
</P>
<P>
As Levine rejected the appeal, a prosecutor is expected to
issue charges against Sheinbein on Monday in Tel Aviv district
court.

<HEADLINE> Israel Detains 3 Allied SLA Officers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli army detained three
intelligence officers of its allied South Lebanon Army (SLA) on
suspect of collaborating with the anti-Israeli Hezbollah
guerrillas in south Lebanon, Israel Radio reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
One of the detainees is a liaison officer between the SLA and
Israel's secret service Mossad, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The move was triggered by reports that some SLA members have
passed on information about the activities of the Israeli army in
the so-called security zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The reports emerged again after four Israelis, including a
brigadier-general, were killed by two roadside bombs in the
security zone late last month.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out the 15-kilometer-deep border buffer zone in
south Lebanon in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its
northern border areas from cross-border attacks by Hezbollah, or
Party of God guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Around 1,000 Israeli soldiers patrolling the zone are backed by
about 3,000 SLA militiamen.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Israel TV reported that Israel has
sent a message to the Lebanese government warning that it will
put an end to a ceasefire understanding if Beirut fails to
prevent guerrillas from attacking the Israeli army.
</P>
<P>
The understanding, brokered by the U.S. in 1996, bars the
warring sides from staging attacks on or from civilian areas.
</P>
<P>
Israel has charged that Hezbollah was using civilian villages
to smuggle weapons and mount attacks on Israeli military outposts
in the security zone.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Arens has expressed reservations
over the ceasefire understanding, saying it restricts the
capabilities of the Israeli army to retaliate Hezbollah attacks.

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
A written speech was released at the airport in which Jiang said
that as a country of civilization with long history, Italy has once
made important contributions to the progress of the mankind.
</P>
<P>
Italy today is playing a more and more important role in
safeguarding world peace and promoting international cooperation,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
The visiting Chinese President made a high comment in his written
speech on the cooperation between China and Italy in the field of
politics, economy and trade, culture, science and technology in recent

</P>
<P>
People of the two countries have enjoyed a long history of
friendly contacts, and China has valued its relationship with
Italy, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
It has been China's "firm and unchanged" policy to further
consolidate and strengthen the friendly cooperative relationship
with Italy, which is oriented toward the 21st century, Jiang
reassured.
</P>

The Chinese President expressed the belief that the upcoming talks
with his Italian counterpart Oscar Luigi Scalfaro and other senior

<HEADLINE> Jordan Reiterates Support for Palestinian State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein Sunday reiterated that his country supports the rights of
the Palestinian people, particularly the right of establishing an
independent state.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark while meeting with visiting European Union
(EU) Special Envoy on Middle East Affairs Miguiel Moratinos, the
official news agency Petra reported.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah expressed appreciation for what he termed as "wise and
objective European role" in the Middle East peace process, and
thanked the EU for supporting the "just demands of Arabs" on
various occasions.
</P>
<P>
However, Abdullah did not commit his country to supporting a
Palestinian plan to declare an independent state on the specific
date of May 4, when the interim Oslo peace accords between Israel
and the Palestinians expires.
</P>
<P>
Jordan and Egypt, the closest Arab allies of the Palestinians,
have stressed that the timing for the proclamation of statehood
was an internal affair of the Palestinian people. And they said
they would recognize the Palestinian state whenever it was
declared.
</P>
<P>
Currently Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was holding
extensive consultations with Arab and Western countries on whether
to declare an independent state on May 4.
</P>
<P>
Many of the countries Arafat contacted advised him to postpone
the plan to avoid further complicating the already vulnerable
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The peace process has been deadlocked since the end of 1998,
with the two sides trading accusations over the implementation of
the latest Wye River peace accord signed last October.
</P>
<P>
Israel has virtually shelved the accord, blaming Palestinians
for alleged failure to collect illegal weapons and to curb
terrorist attacks on Israel, charges firmly denied by the
Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Chechen Bombing Kills One, Wounds Eight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 21 (Xinhua) -- One person was killed and eight
others were wounded Sunday in an explosion that was believed to be
the fourth attempt to assassinate Chechen President Aslan
Maskhadov, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Maskhadov was unharmed in the blast on an avenue in Central
Grozny, capital of the breakaway Russian republic.
</P>
<P>
The wounded included four of Maskhadov's bodyguards, one of
whom was under intensive care, Interfax reported, quoting
Maskhadov's spokesman, Mairbek Vachagayev.
</P>
<P>
The explosive device, with an equivalent in power of up to 10
kilograms of TNT and believed to be remote-controlled, badly
damaged seven vehicles, including two cars of the presidential
motorcade.
</P>
<P>
Chechen Deputy Prosecutor General Magomed Magomadov said there
was a link between the bombing and the kidnapping on March 5 of
Russian Interior Ministry envoy Maj. Gen. Gennady Shpigun.
</P>
<P>
"Both crimes are aimed at complete destabilization of the
situation in Chechnya and discredit of authority in the republic,"
Magomadov said.
</P>
<P>
The previous attempt to murder Maskhadov was made last Summer,
when a bomb planted on another Grozny street killed four
presidential bodyguards and mangled the president's armored
vehicle, Interfax said.

LONDON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Britain on Sunday welcomed U.S.
special envoy Richard Holbrooke's planned visit to Yugoslavia and
said it was "an opportunity" for the peace settlement in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke's visit "provides an opportunity to reinforce the
international community's insistence that Milosevic agrees to the
Rambouillet (peace) package in full," a Foreign Office spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Holbrooke is scheduled to go to Belgrade on Monday to deliver a

<P>
He will warn the Serbian leadership to cease aggression in
Kosovo or face NATO military action, U.S. Secretary of State

Before going to Belgrade, Holbrooke will meet, in Brussels on

Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine, the co-chairmen of the now-halted
Kosovo peace talks, a British Foreign Office spokesman told
Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders would discuss some details of the planned
meeting with Milosevic, the spokesman said.

The U.S. envoy would contact the co-chairmen again after his
return from Belgrade so that they could reach decisions on "the

<HEADLINE> Israel Arrests SLA Members for Aiding Hezbollah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Israel arrested three members of
its allied South Lebanon Army (SLA) in south Lebanon on Sunday on
suspicion of spying for the Shiite Muslim militant group
Hezbollah, or Party of God.
</P>
<P>
Among the detained, Adel Younes, a SLA liaison officer with
Israel's Mossad secret service, was held for allegedly passing on
information to the guerrilla group, the Orient radio quoted
security sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
But it is unclear if the three arrested would be transferred to
Israel or put into the SLA-run Khiam Detention Center inside the
Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah is spearheading a war of attrition to oust about
1,500 Israeli occupation forces and 2,500 SLA militiamen out of
the country.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a security zone in south Lebanon in 1985 after
two invasions, with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Last April, Israel offered to withdraw its troops from the
Lebanon quagmire but conditioned a pullout on Lebanese
government's security guarantee for the north of Israel.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and its main power broker Syria rejected the offer,
demanding Israeli troops leave the country without any
conditions.

ADDIS ABABA, March 21 (Xinhua) --The Ethiopian Ministry of
Water Resources Sunday urged the Ethiopians to properly use and
protect water resources in the country.
</P>
<P>
Tadesse Araya, head of Public Relations and Information
Services Department of the ministry, said that the demand of the
global population for water is steadily going up due to, among
others, expansion of urban centers, farms and industries,
resulting in the ever dwindling per head share of the resources.
</P>
<P>
He said this in a statement marking the World Water Day which
will be observed throughout the world on Monday. The theme of this
year's World Water Day is "everyone leaves down stream".
</P>
<P>
Tadesse Araya said that most human activities in Ethiopia,
especially in urban centers, are increasingly polluting the water
resources. Water pollution is responsible for 75 percent of health
problems in the country, he added.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the necessity to carry out campaigns to raise
awareness among the populace on proper utilization, protection and
related issues concerning the water resources.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicated that two-thirds of rural people and
one-fourth urban residents in Sub-Saharan Africa are living
without safe water and millions of Africans die every year due to

<HEADLINE> Record-Setting Balloonists Picked up in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 21 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian military helicopter
picked up the two balloonists who succeeded in circumnavigating
the earth in a hot-air balloon before landing in southern Egypt on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The pilot of the helicopter, one of the three heading for the
landing site in the Dakhla Oasis, 485 kilometers southwest of
Cairo, spotted Bertrand Piccard and his fellow aviator Brian Jones
several hours after their landing, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The helicopter carried the two balloonists to Dakhla airport,
where Piccard and Jones will be flown to Cairo to hold a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
After nearly 20 days of circumnavigating the globe, the
Breitling Orbiter 3 balloon, in which the two balloonists were in,
landed gently at 08:03 local time (0603 GMT) at Mut, a town in the
Dakhla Oasis.
</P>
<P>
The successful landing of the balloon has ensured Piccard and
Jones a place in history as the first aviators to fly non-stop
around the world in a hot-air balloon.
</P>
<P>
Piccard, a 41-year-old Swiss psychiatrist, and Jones, a
51-year-old British instructor and grandfather, had wanted to land
near the pyramids on the outskirts of Cairo, but unfavorable winds
kept them away.
</P>
<P>
After 19 days aloft, the huge silver balloon, 54 meters tall,
or as high as 13 stories, floated over Mauritania past longitude 9
degrees west at 0954 GMT Saturday to complete the 41,841-kilometer
non-stop circumnavigation.

<P>
CAIRO, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) asserted its
determination on Sunday to face up to Israel's violation of the
international legitimacy and international laws.
</P>
<P>
In a statement marking the 54th anniversary of AL's founding,
AL Secretary General Esmat Abdel-Meguid stressed the league's
keenness on getting Israel out of the occupied Arab territories.
</P>
<P>
In the Arab-Israeli conflict after 1948, Israel occupied large
parts of Arab lands. Under peace agreements reached through
negotiations starting in 1991, Israel has handed over a proportion
of the West Bank and Gaza Strip to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
But due to Israel's failure to fully comply with the signed
agreements, the Jewish state has yet to surrender more land to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israel is occupying the Golan Heights which it
captured from Syria in the 1967 Mideast War and a border strip in
south Lebanon to allegedly protect its northern areas from
attacks launched by Muslim guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid expressed the league's readiness to continue its
efforts to restore Arab solidarity and develop cooperation among
the member states.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait caused deep rifts in the Arab
world, which is still divided in policies towards the country
under United Nations crippling economic sanctions imposed after
the invasion.
</P>
<P>
The league chief voiced determination to render the Middle
East a region free of weapons of mass destruction and direct all
available Arab potentials to reinforce prospects of
socio-economic development.

MOSCOW, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. plans for creating a
regional anti-missile defense system in Northeastern Asia and for
expanding its military alliance with Japan "cannot help but raise
questions," a top Russian diplomat said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The region views these plans with unease," Deputy Foreign

"There is apprehension that the creation of an anti-missile

"In the long run, it would contribute to the appearance of
durable, if not permanent, dividing lines in the Asia-Pacific
region," he said.

Karashin said the current geo-political situation calls for the

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 22 (Xinhua) -- India and Russia signed an
agreement Monday on the training of Indian service officers in
Russian military institutions.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by Indian Defense Minister George
Fernandes and Russian Defense Minister Igor Dmitriyevich Sergeyev,
who arrived in India last Friday for a five-day official visit.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers Monday met and discussed ongoing military
cooperation between the two countries and "explored possibilities
of further strengthening and speeding up the process," an Indian
Defense Ministry spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement laid down broad terms and conditions of the
training program for Indian service personnel, according to the
spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed on the background of discontinuation
of a training program for Indian servicemen officers by the United
States following India's nuclear tests in May last year.
</P>
<P>
The Russian defense minister had already visited Agra, some 200
kilometers south of here, and Goa, a scenic coastal spot and a
military base about 1,900 kilometers southwest of the Indian
capital.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev condemned the United States on Sunday for planning to
create a theater missile defense system in Asia which he said
could upset the present system of security and balance of forces
in the region.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with The Hindu daily before his arrival,
Sergeyev said that a new re-division of the world through the use
of force-related factor, economic, political and military, was
being enacted.
</P>
<P>
He said that Russian-Indo relations were rising to the "level
of real strategic partnership" in the face of an intense struggle
for the formation of multi-polar world.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 22 (Xinhua) -- A United Nations agency is
promoting low-cost and locally-produced irrigation technology such
as pumps, hose and drip systems to help increase food production
and employment in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said on Monday
that irrigation contributes significantly to reducing poverty and
hunger.
</P>
<P>
In a report to mark World Water day which falls on March 22,
FAO said irrigated agriculture provides 40 percent of world food
production and about 60 percent of the extra food to sustain a
growing population in the long-run.
</P>
<P>
It said groundwater has increased employment and income in
countries such as Bangladesh, Kenya and Zimbabwe by extending
small-scale irrigation.
</P>
<P>
With more jobs and a higher income, people in the rural areas
will have less reason to migrate to the cities, the report said.
</P>
<P>
FAO appealed for low-cost and easily operational technology for
small farmers and "equitable and efficient use of land and water"
for men and women.

NICOSIA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus is determined to solve
the problem of water shortage by building more desalination
plants, the Agriculture, Natural Resources and the Environment
Minister Costas Themistocleous said here on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Themistocleous was speaking at a seminar on the presentation
and promotion of equipment to save water, on the occasion of
Monday's International Water Day.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry would study the need and viability of the
construction of a third desalination plant in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Themistocleous referred to the measures undertaken by the
government with the construction of two desalination units on the
island.
</P>
<P>
He said the government was promoting more projects according
to the Water Development Scheme which will cover all needs until
the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister stressed that people should become more
aware of the water shortage problem on the island.
</P>
<P>
The water reserves in Cyprus' dams are estimated at 60 million
cubic meters or 22 percent of their capacity.
</P>
<P>
The normal figure per annum is 138 million cubic meters, 57
million of which are for water supply purposes and the remaining
81 million for irrigation purposes.
</P>
<P>
The president of the Nicosia Water Board, Andreas Poliviou,
said water rationing measures would continue this year.

southeast Turkey.

<P>
About half the Iraqi oil exports flows through the pipeline,
which is composed of two parallel lines.
</P>
<P>
No one has claimed responsibility for the explosion, but the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party, which has been fighting for an
independent Kurdish state in southeast Turkey, had targeted the
pipeline in the past.
</P>
<P>
The oil flow between the two neighboring countries resumed
earlier this month after United States warplanes bombarded the

ISLAMABAD, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Minister Sartaj Aziz
said Monday that Pakistan is pursuing in good faith, various
confidence-building measures in order to create a positive
atmosphere for substantive discussions on Kashmir and other
related issues with India.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference here Monday afternoon, Aziz, who
had two meetings with his Indian counterpart Jaswant Singh on the
sidelines of the 21st Session of the Council of Ministers of the
South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) on March
18-20 at Nuwara Eliya, Sri Lanka, said: "Our focus in these
meetings was to explore ways and means to build on the Lahore
Declaration."
</P>
<P>
"We both agreed that we should evolve a road map or a time
schedule under which each element of the Lahore Declaration and
the two other documents issued at Lahore, namely the Joint
Statement and the Memorandum of Understanding, would be discussed
in order to intensify the composite and integrated dialogue
process," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the foreign minister, meetings of experts between
the two countries will be held in April/May to discuss the
implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding signed in
Lahore.
</P>
<P>
The next round of integrated dialogue on the agreed agenda will
commence in May/June between the foreign secretaries of the two
countries on the two issues of Kashmir and peace and security in
New Delhi and on six other issues in Islamabad between officials
concerned.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers will meet soon after the May/June
round of dialogue to review the outcome and carry the process
further.
</P>
<P>
The committee on the release of civilian prisoners and other
humanitarian issues will meet in April, 1999 to formalize the
agreement on these matters already discussed on the official
level. The committee consists of the ministers of state on foreign
affairs of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Experts from India will visit Pakistan in April to identify
areas of cooperation in the field of information technology and
coordination of respective positions in the forthcoming meetings
of the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also agreed to relax the visa regime for certain
categories of visitors who will be issued a one-year, multiple
entry visa covering all cities and without any requirement for
police reporting. Detailed announcement in this regard will be
made by the two governments shortly.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that the concrete time schedule to intensify the
dialogue process should help to reaffirm the commitment of both
sides to implementing the Lahore Declaration.
</P>
<P>
However, he also said that progress on these
confidence-building measures will be difficult to sustain or even
justify, if there is no progress on the substantive issue of
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Any efforts to normalize the relations between India and
Pakistan without resolving the Kashmir issue are not likely to go
very far, he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Teenager Charged With First-Degree Murder in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 22 (Xinhua) -- In a case that has raised
tensions between Israel and the United States, Israeli prosecutors
Monday charged a U.S. teenager with first-degree murder.
</P>
<P>
In the hearing, prosecutors of the Tel-Aviv District Court
charged 18-year-old Samuel Sheinbein with premeditated murder of
a boy in the United States in September 1997.
</P>
<P>
Sheinbein and his accomplice strangled the boy to death and cut
his body with an electric saw to avoid being discovered, said the
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
If Sheinbein is convicted, he will get a life sentence
under the law of Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, no date has been set for the trial which has to be
concluded within nine months. And dozens of witnesses will have
to fly to Israel from the U.S. for the trial.
</P>
<P>
Sheinbein, who was born and raised in the United States, fled
to Israel three days after the victim's body was found. His
accomplice committed suicide in Maryland after being detained by
the police.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. police had asked Israel to extradite Sheinbein to
stand trial in the U.S.. But the Israeli Supreme Court ruled last
month that Sheinbein was an Israeli citizen as well and refused
the extradition appeal.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made on the fact that Sheinbein's father was
born in Israel and holds an Israeli passport. An Israeli law
passed in 1978 bans extradition of Israeli citizens.
</P>
<P>
The ruling draw harsh criticism from U.S. law enforcement
officials and also infuriated the victim's family.
</P>
<P>
Following the ruling, Israeli Attorney General Elyakim
Rubinstein also lodged an appeal, asking the court to convene
an expanded bench to reconsider the case.
</P>
<P>
But the Supreme Court rejected his request on Sunday and
paved the way for Sheinbein's trial in Israel.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Expects to Produce More Cashew Nuts This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is expected to harvest
120,000 tons of raw cashew nuts this year, 10,000 tons more than
last year, Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's cashew growers have already begun harvesting the 1999
crop. The price for raw cashew nuts is rising sharply in Vietnam's
markets.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam Cashew Association forecasts that if its processors
were permitted to import 40,000 tons of raw cashew nuts and run at
their full capacity, the country would be able to export 40,000
tons of processed nuts for 180 million U.S. dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
However, in the first two months of this year, Vietnam exported
only 14 million dollars of cashew nuts, an 8.3-percent drop
compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
As prolonged droughts badly affected the cashew crop, Vietnam
exported only 27,000 tons of processed cashew nuts in 1998, a
28-percent decrease from 1997.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, Vietnam's southern provinces have been growing
cashew, which has become a high-export value industrial crop of
the country. Vietnam increased cashew acreage from 30,000 hectares
in 1980 to 250,000 hectares in 1997 when it exported 33,300 tons
of processed cashew nuts, becoming the world's second biggest
cashew exporter after India.
</P>
<P>
VNA said that Vietnam's cashew nuts have been highly
appreciated in the world market for their high quality. Vietnam
holds 20 percent of the world market share, exporting to 20
countries, with China, Europe and America being its major markets.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice-Premier Urges Tighter Fire Controls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wen Jiabao
today called for effective measures to prevent forest fires in the
coming spring, which he said could be quite a troublesome period
because of the relatively high winter temperatures.
</P>
<P>
Wen, who is also a member of the Political Bureau of the
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, pointed out
that less snow had fallen this winter, which meant that
undergrowth, trees and foliage were dryer than usual.
</P>
<P>
And he said that fire prevention facilities in some forest
areas in Heilongjiang Province and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous
Region were destroyed in last year's serious summer floods.
</P>
<P>
"In some forest areas in the south, the fire prevention period
should be extended this year in response to continued arid weather
conditions and the frequent outbreak of forest fires which have
already been occurring," the vice-premier said.
</P>
<P>
Both the numbers of fires and resultant casualties in the first
two months of this year were considerably higher than in the same
period of last year, according to Wen.
</P>
<P>
"All the places and relevant departments must be fully prepared
for the possibly severe fire control situation this year," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Fire prevention is not only important for the protection of
forest resources but also has a direct bearing on the overall
situation of reform, opening-up and social stability," Wen said.
</P>
<P>
He called for increased efforts to monitor potential fire
threats, tighten control over people's activities in the forests,
and make better preparations for fire control.

<HEADLINE> hke032272-Bangladeshi High Court Adjourns Hearing on Hartal Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The High Court Division Bench of
the Bangladesh Supreme Court adjourned hearing on a rule on
activities for and against hartals (strikes) on Monday till April
19 following a prayer from the representative of the government.
</P>
<P>
The High Court issued the suo moto rule last month, asking the
ruling and opposition parties and the government to "show the
cause why pro- and anti-hartal activities shall not be declared
cognizable offense." Suo moto, a legal term, means "acting on its
own."
</P>
<P>
It was for the first time in the history of the country that a
suo moto rule has been issued by the highest court on the hartal
issue.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan, general secretary of the opposition
Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), said in his statement that
hartal had been a historically recognized democratic right
exercised by political parties at different times in this
subcontinent. He was represented by Barrister Moudud Ahmed, his
counsel, at the court.
</P>
<P>
He said that hartal was the most peaceful expression of protest
as a political action used as a last resort, and that the BNP and
its allies were calling hartals as a last resort when the
government repeatedly failed to meet opposition's demands and
ignored people's rights.
</P>
<P>
Committing an offense in activities either for or against
hartal came under the purview of law and that offenders should be
punished in accordance with law, he said.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, ruling Bangladesh Awami League's (BAL)
General Secretary Zillur Rahman, represented by his counsel
Mahbubey Alam, said that peace processions of BAL could not be
treated as criminal acts, as the party "never asked any people to
involve themselves in any criminal act for the purpose of
resisting pro-hartal activities."
</P>
<P>
The supporters of the BAL brought out peace processions during
opposition-sponsored hartal hours to encourage people to continue
their normal work without any fear, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The processions and public gatherings of Awami League were
absolutely peaceful," while "activities of the pro-hartal
activities constitute cognizable offenses," he said.
</P>
<P>
The High Court Division Bench adjourned the hearing when the
Attorney General on behalf of the government prayed for time to
submit his written arguments against the statement made by the BNP
general secretary.
</P>
<P>
Both the ruling and the opposition sides challenged the
jurisdiction of the High Court Division to issue such a rule when
it began the hearing on March 8.
</P>
<P>
Hartal is a special political phenomenon in Bangladesh, where
opposition parties frequently call hartals to oppose the ruling
party while the latter adopts anti-hartal activities, resulting in
clashes and bringing almost all economic activities across the
country to a standstill during the shutdown.

<HEADLINE> No-confidence Motion Against Turkish Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- A no-confidence motion against
the Turkish government was rejected in the parliament on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Of the 447 legislators participated in the ballot, only 236
voted for the motion against the government led by Democratic Left
Party (DSP) leader Bulent Ecevit.
</P>
<P>
Under the Turkish constitution, 276 votes are required in the
550-seat parliament to topple the government.
</P>
<P>
The motion was present by a group of "disgruntled" legislators,
who were not included in the candidates lists for the elections
from their respective parties.
</P>
<P>
They also attempted to bring the parliament into a debate on a
motion on the postponement of the local and parliamentary
elections scheduled on April 18.
</P>
<P>
The deputies had earlier presented the motion to Parliament
Speaker Hikmet Cetin to postpone the elections. But Cetin refused
to send the motion directly to the plenary session and instead
referred it to the Constitutional Commission of Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Observers here believe the motion is not likely to succeed in
balking the elections.

<HEADLINE> Russian FM: Strikes on Kosovo Senseless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Igor
Ivanov said here Monday that military strikes against Yugoslavia
make no sense.
</P>
<P>
"If we are interested in a long-term peaceful settlement of the
Kosovo problem, we would have to admit that it is impossible to
achieve this by using such methods," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Ivanov said, "Those pursuing other goals will bear the
responsibility for the consequences."
</P>
<P>
"The history of the Balkans and the entire world experience
show that attempts to find a quick solution to a problem by using
force will lead to opposite results, the further escalation of
tension and deterioration of the situation in the region," Ivanov
said.
</P>
<P>
"In any case, one would have to return to political forms of
settlement, as the experience with Iraq makes clear," the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
"If we are really interested in stability in the Balkans and if
we are to ensure that this region ceases to be a threat to
European security, we must look for ways to settle the situation
in Kosovo by political means," Ivanov said.
</P>
<P>
He called for "legal and constitutional norms that would allow
the different ethnic groups(Albanians, Serbs, Turks, Gypsies)
living in Kosovo to coexist peacefully within an undivided and
sovereign Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
"This can only be achieved by talks and mutual compromises, and
with due account of the interests of all sides," he said.

BRUSSELS, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty

Holbrooke, after meeting with Solana and NATO Supreme Commander

<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
finalized its plan to set up five more urea fertilizer factories
in the country in the wake of a huge reserve of natural gas, the
official BSS news agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The decision was taken at a high-level meeting held here Monday
with Commerce and Industries Minister Tofael Ahmed in the chair,
and the meeting also identified the sites for these fertilizer
factories.
</P>
<P>
As of today, the country has 23 trillion cubic feet (TCF)
proven reserve of natural gas, of which 13 TCF is exploitable. And
out of the 13 TCF, three has already been utilized, the minister
told the meeting.
</P>
<P>
As many foreign companies are now exploring at different
blocks, the government has approved the plan to set up more
fertilizer factories with a view to producing more value-added
products from the valuable natural gas for export, he added.
</P>
<P>
The meeting discussed in detail the latest position of the
progress for setting up these factories. The Bangladesh Chemical
Industry Corporation (BCIC) was urged to speed up the preparatory
work.
</P>
<P>
The BCIC, the state-owned firm, has six urea fertilizer
factories having the capacity to meet local demand of 2.1-2.2
million tons.
</P>
<P>
However, the report did mentioned when the plan would be
implemented and the cost for setting up these factories.

<HEADLINE> Detained U.S. Plane Waiting For Clearance in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The aircraft registered in the
United States, which was detained with its two-member crew since
March 17 for allegedly violating Indian airspace, is still waiting
for clearance by the Director General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India (PTI) reported Monday that local
customs authorities had already given clearance to the crew, one
of which is a British national, but the airports authority of
India was still awaiting final clearance from BGCA.
</P>
<P>
The turbo-prop two-seater aircraft, belonging to the British
Cooper Aerial Survey, was reportedly impounded after it landed for
refueling at the Sardar Patel international airport in the
southwest coastal state of Gujarat on March 17.
</P>
<P>
Newspapers published here on Monday quoted official sources as
saying that the crew, a pilot and navigator, intruded into Indian
airspace without valid immigration papers.
</P>
<P>
The plane, which was on a Thailand-Calcutta-Karachi flight, was
reportedly fitted with cameras on its belly and had filmed
"restricted areas" over Indian territory.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the plane, coming from outside India and
heading towards Karachi, Pakistan, had stopped at Nagpur, 1,012 km
south of here, for refueling and went off the radar system soon
after.
</P>
<P>
After remaining out of contact for three hours, apparently
because of flying at a very low altitude, it sought permission to
land at the Ahmedabad airport, 915 km southwest of the Indian
capital.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Should Sustain Engagement with China: Perry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. secretary of
defense William Perry said here Monday that the United States
should sustain its engagement with China, including expanding
business and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
Perry, who has just completed a trip to Beijing, Taibei, Seoul
and Tokyo, told a luncheon hosted by the Asia Society Hong Kong
Center that United States, as a Pacific power, pursues a policy of
engagement with China.
</P>
<P>
Under the leadership of Deng Xiaoping, Perry said, China began
to open to the world, taking "audacious and, as it turned out,
successful experiment with elements of the market economy."
</P>
<P>
The engagement between the United States and China began with
the Shanghai Communique in 1972, said Perry.
</P>
<P>
"This engagement, or course, has had its ups and its downs," he
said, "but even when it was down, there was welcome change in the
Cold War confrontation."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. engagement policy is to "pursue a constructive course
with China" so that we can peacefully turn the conflict (of
interests) into the cooperation, he added.
</P>
<P>
"This is not a rosy-eyed view that everything is going to be
harmonious," he added.
</P>
<P>
Perry said Taiwan has been a "touchstone" of improved U.S.-
China relations and can also be a "flash point" of the
relationship. He added that the concern about the Chinese missile
program aggravated by the allegation of nuclear espionage has led
to serious challenges to the U.S. Administration's engagement
policy.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that we should sustain our engage with China, and
that this engagement should include robust business transactions.
We should be imposing serious, I believe needless hardships to our
companies if we just significantly hobble their ability to trade
with China," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said: "I do not want that trade to include military
technology. And I will be cautious in letting our companies sell
dual-use products, whenever those products are available only from
American companies."
</P>
<P>
Perry, now North Korea Policy Coordinator for the United States
and a professor with Stanford University, said what the United
States wants to get in a long term is a peaceful relationship as
well as developing trade partnership with China.
</P>
<P>
"Every time we have something like President Clinton going to
China or (Chinese Premier) Zhu Rongji coming to the United States,
everybody wants to point to a specific success or a specific
product... but the reason why we are doing this engagement is the
long-term stability and long-term economic growth," he said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, India Exchange Civilian Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani and Indian
authorities on Monday exchanged dozens of civilian prisoners at
the Wagha border, marking the implementation of the Lahore
Declaration reached between the prime ministers of the two
countries last month.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan handed over 14 Indian prisoners at the Wagah border
where Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee put his first
step on Pakistan's soil and was welcomed by his Pakistani
counterpart Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
In return, India released 43 prisoners to the Pakistani side.
</P>
<P>
This is the first exchange of prisoners between the two
countries since 1991 and details of the swap were finalized by
official delegations of the two sides in Islamabad earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
The repatriated Pakistani citizens were arrested by the Indian
Border Security Force (BSF) for crossing the border without proper
documents and other offenses, according to Pakistani officials.
</P>
<P>
They were later tried and imprisoned in different jails in
India under various terms ranging from one year to six years.
</P>
<P>
Pakistani Interior Minister Shujaat Hussain said Sunday the two
countries had also agreed to release fishermen who inadvertently
crossed over into each other's waters.
</P>
<P>
In a month's time, Pakistan will release 109 Indian fishermen
and 17 of their boats, while India will free 26 Pakistani
fishermen and 3 Pakistani vessels, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
To create a congenial atmosphere between Pakistan and India
following the Lahore Declaration jointly signed by Sharif and
Vajpayee, the two sides have decided to solve problems of civilian
prisoners on humanitarian grounds.
</P>
<P>
"The prime ministers of both countries have agreed to
facilitate more contacts between the separated families and
prisoners, and for this purpose the procedure of interviews with
prisoners is being simplified," said the minister.

LUSAKA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government Monday
urged the people living upstream in the country to looked after
water properly for those downstream.
</P>
<P>
Energy Minister Ben Mwila called on his countrymen to use water
wisely because it is critical to all forms of life and plays an
important role in economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
He made the appeal here when he officiated at the World Water
Day celebration.

<P>
The activities of those communities upstream affected those
downstream and it is important for those upstream to protect water
for those downstream, he said, adding that the government has
worked out various measures together with communities to ensure
sustainable use of the water.
</P>
<P>
To manage the use of water effectively, the government has to
have a lot of information on how the water is being used by
various stakeholders, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Zambia has a well distributed system of perennial rivers,
streams, lakes and swamps throughout the territory. The surface
water resources are estimated to cover 45,000 square kilometers of
the country's total land area.

<HEADLINE> OAU Chief Appeals for End to Ethio-Eritrean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Salim Ahmed Salim,
Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU),
Monday reiterated his appeal for an immediate end to the fighting
between Ethiopia and Eritrea and the implementation of the OAU
framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
The statement was made by the OAU chief when he was addressing
the opening ceremony of the 69th Session of the OAU Council of
Ministers in the Ethiopian capital.
</P>
<P>
Salim said OAU, through its high level delegation, has invested
a great deal of energy and effort in striving to seek a peaceful
solution to this unfortunate crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The peace proposals submitted to the parties by the OAU high
level delegation were welcomed by the international community at
large as fair and balanced," he said, adding that "in submitting
these proposals, the first and foremost consideration was to avoid
the resumption of hostilities by providing the basis for a
peaceful settlement."
</P>
<P>
He noted that it is a matter of profound regret that despite
the OAU's efforts which were supported by the international
community, "the war resumed with greater intensity between the two
Horn of Africa countries, with its attendant loss of life and
destruction and its complicating consequences for the peace
process."
</P>
<P>
Since the resumption of hostilities, Salim said, the OAU high
level delegation has been calling for an immediate cessation of
hostilities and a return to the peace process based on the
implementation of the OAU framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
"The OAU will continue with its efforts and will do its utmost
to achieve this goal," Salim said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav army is prepared to
repel any cross-border armed attacks on the country as it is
authorized to do under the constitution, a statement issued Monday
by the arm press bureau said.
</P>
<P>
The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) recently
threatened military action against Yugoslavia under the pretext of
resolving the Kosovo crisis, the statement said, noting that NATO
has deployed 10,000 to 12,000 troops in neighboring Macedonia and
a large number of naval and air forces in the Mediterranean Sea
and the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the statement said, some foreign political
forces and news media accused the Serb delegation of rejecting the
Kosovo peace deal, and even spread rumors about Yugoslavia's mass
military build-up in Kosovo and humanitarian crises there.
</P>
<P>
Such accusations and rumors largely came from the political
forces behind the armies in neighboring countries and those openly
supporting the separatists in Kosovo, the statement said, adding
that the Yugoslav military firmly rejected them.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the degree of the Yugoslav army's
involvement in Kosovo was in line with the degree of danger there
and the army's activities had posed no threat to neighboring
countries and local residents.
</P>
<P>
Once the "terrorists" in Kosovo ceased their provocative
activities and NATO gave up its military threats, Yugoslavia would
pull out its troops immediately, it added.

<HEADLINE> China to Boost Cooperation with World Anti-corruption Agencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese procuratorial
organs are willing to establish links and strengthen cooperation
with anti-corruption agencies of various countries and regions in
the world on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
Bi Wei, deputy director-general of the General Bureau Against
Corruption of the Supreme People's Procuratorate of China, made
these remarks at a three-day international conference on fighting
corruption into the 21st century which opened here Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
He said in view of the present status and future tend of
corruption and anti-corruption, "the anti-corruption strategy for
the 21st century should be global cooperation and societal
participation".
</P>
<P>
With the expansion of economic integration, the forming of
regional markets and the development of regional international
economic organizations, he said regional features of crimes of
corruption are very prominent among countries and regions that
have close geographical position, economic development levels and
cultural traditions.
</P>
<P>
In solving the global issue of combating and containing
corruption offenses, he said: "We should stick to the anti-
corruption strategy of societal participation, and at the same
time we must strengthen regional and international cooperation in
our drive against corruption."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has always attached great importance to
international criminal judicial assistance, he said.
</P>
<P>
China has signed bilateral criminal judicial assistance
treaties with 28 countries, and signed extradition treaties with
10 countries, and are holding or will soon hold negotiations on
concluding judicial assistance and extradition treaties with more
countries.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Chinese government has also acceded to
international conventions involving criminal judicial assistance,
and has taken and are taking measures to actively carry out
international judicial assistance including anti-corruption
offenses.
</P>
<P>
On anti-corruption cooperation between the Chinese mainland and
Hong Kong, Bi said that the Hong Kong Independent Commission
Against Corruption (ICAC) has maintained close ties and effective
cooperation with procuratorial organs on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
He mentioned the first visit to Beijing by Chief Commissioner
Lily Yam of ICAC of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in
November, 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said Hong Kong's return to China has greatly promoted links
and cooperation between ICAC and the procuratorial organs on the
mainland.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the belief that at the turn of the century, the
procuratorial organs on the mainland and ICAC will constantly
expand fields of cooperation and increase its channels, level and
results, making together greater contributions to a more clean,
just, civilized and highly-efficient China striding into the 21st
century.

<HEADLINE> Another Ethiopian Fighter Jet Downed: Eritrea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Eritrea said Monday its army had
shot down an Ethiopian Mig-23 fighter jet during fightings at the
Mereb-Setit front along their disputed border over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean Foreign Ministry said in a statement that the
fighter jet was shot down Sunday, which becomes the third
Ethiopian aircraft Eritrea claims it has destroyed in the past
week, a report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Fighting between the two Horn of Africa neighbors shifted back
to Badme last week from the central Tsorona front, where Eritrea
announced a series of victories and said it killed more than
10,000 Ethiopian troops.
</P>
<P>
"The Ethiopian regime launched the attacks (at Badme) last
Wednesday in an apparent attempt to over-extend the Eritrean
defense forces, which routed a huge Ethiopian attack on the
Tsorona front," said the Eritrean statement.
</P>
<P>
However, the claim was denied by Ethiopian government
spokeswoman Selome Taddesse, who said fighting was continuing on
the western Badme front. Ethiopia also denied heavy losses at
Tsorona, while no comment was yet given on its casualties at
Badme.
</P>
<P>
The border war between the two countries started in May last
year over a 390-square-kilometer patch of rocky land southwest of
Eritrean capital Asmara and was renewed in early February.
</P>
<P>
Both the United Nations and the Organization of African Unity
have tried to mediate for a ceasefire, with no success so far.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea won independence from Ethiopia in 1993 and the two
countries were allies until the border dispute turned into
violence in May of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Fujian Universities Ready To Admit Taiwan Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Two higher education institutes in
east China's Fujian Province will hold independent admission tests
for applicants from Taiwan Province this year, according to an
official today.
</P>
<P>
"The Fujian Teachers' University and Fujian College of
Traditional Chinese Medicine have made full preparations for
accepting applications from Taiwan students," Zhu Yongkang,
Director of Fujian Provincial Education Committee, said at a press
conference.
</P>
<P>
Applicants from Taiwan have been on steady rise in recent years
partly due to the high level of education and relatively low
education costs in Fujian and to the complementary and
supplementary disciplines between higher learning institutes in
Taiwan and Fujian, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
"The relevant departments of Fujian have drawn up detailed
regulations regarding tests, admission and the teaching of
students from Taiwan," said. Zhu.
</P>
<P>
Students from Taiwan can apply for admission to the two Fujian
institutes year-round and take two independent tests, in August
and January, in addition to a unified national matriculation test,
according to the rules.

<P>
They are tested in the 3+X format, namely three nationally
unified subject tests (Chinese, English and Mathematics) besides
a fourth in which they intend to specialize, such as history,
geography, physics, chemistry and biology, Zhu revealed.

Official statistics show that currently more than 1,700 Taiwan
students are enrolled in higher education institutes in Fujian.

<HEADLINE> hke032253 - Malaysia Expects Intellectual Property Market to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 22 (Xinhua) -- A completely new market is
predicted to emerge for commercial buying and selling of made-in-
Malaysia intellectual property worth over 1 billion ringgit
(263.157 million U.S. dollars) by 2001.
</P>
<P>
Making the prediction, Henry Goh, the newly-elected president
of the Malaysian chapter of the Licensing, Executives Society
(LES), the world's largest intellectual property society, said
Monday that this is achievable since Malaysian information
technology companies now comprise more than 67 percent of the 205
companies granted with the Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC) status.
</P>
<P>
As 139 Malaysian and joint-venture MSC companies begin to
realize the fruits of their research and development in
information technology and biotechnology, they would be in a
position to sell or license their know-hows in the international
markets, said Henry Goh said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"Based just on the current 139 Malaysian MSC companies and
their success in spawning home-grown innovations, the licensing
value of made-in-Malaysia intellectual property will surpass 1
billion ringgit within the next two years," he said.
</P>
<P>
The number of Malaysian knowledge workers at MSC companies
jumped from 2,706 in October 1997 to 9,163 this month, showing
that the MSC would develop even faster as the economy recovers,
according to Goh, who is also president of Henry Goh &AMP; Co Sdn Bhd,
an intellectual property consultancy firm.

<P>
CANBERRA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Improved commodity prices
dragged the Australian dollar higher Monday.
</P>
<P>
HSBC Markets chief dealer Mike Hollows said there was
"reasonable demand" for the Australian currency, after people were
caught short last week as gold prices fell.
</P>
<P>
Prices for the precious metal plunged last week amid
speculation on International Monetary Fund gold sales.
</P>
<P>
At the close of trading the Australian dollar was buying 63.08
U.S. cents from 62.82 U.S. cents Friday. It traded during the day
between 63.12 US cents and 62.98 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar suffers when commodity and gold prices
fall because raw materials make up two-thirds of the country's
exports.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was buying 0.5791 euro from 0.5716 euro
Friday, while the euro was trading at 1.0894 U.S. dollars from

<HEADLINE> China Launches Investigation into Russian Dumping of Steel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- A major investigation was
launched Monday by the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation (MOFTEC) into the mass dumping in China of cold-rolled
silicon steel from Russia.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC said in a press release that, in accordance with
China's anti-dumping and anti-subsidy regulations, it and the
General Administration of Customs started investigating the
quantities of Russian steel being allegedly dumped after a lawsuit
was filed on March 2.
</P>
<P>
This was initiated by the Wuhan Iron and Steel (Group) Co. in
central China's Hubei Province, China Daily "Business Weekly"
reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the State Economic and Trade Commission and other
relevant departments of the State Council have launched their own
investigations into whether the importing of steel has harmed
China's industry and into the overall affect.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary ruling will be made in about 60 days from the
date of filing, in accordance with anti-dumping regulations. The
final ruling will be made anytime between four and nine months
following the findings of the preliminary ruling.
</P>
<P>
The investigation is the second anti-dumping case in China
since the problems of imported newsprint in 1997.
</P>
<P>
MOFTEC has formally informed the Russian ambassador in China
and asked for cooperation in providing the names of relevant
Russian producers and exporters of such steel.
</P>
<P>
A legal spokesman for the Wuhan company said that since 1996,
cold rolled silicon steel had been flooding into China at prices
of 2,000 yuan (241 US dollars) per ton, lower than its normal
value.
</P>
<P>
"The production cost of the Russian steel, based on the cost
of the manufacturing process, was much higher than the prices at
which it was being sold in China," said He Jinghua, a lawyer with
Huangzhong &AMP; Partners, the firm's attorneys. But he declined to
reveal more details.
</P>
<P>
He said that the alleged dumping had done considerable damage
to his client's production and sales.

<HEADLINE> IMF to Open Representative Office in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A This Day report quoted Monday presidency sources in Abuja as
saying that the IMF office will also assist the Central Bank of
Nigeria and the Finance Ministry to create a chartered framework
for economic policies, information and data gathering to enhance
planning and execution of government policies.
</P>
<P>
IMF Managing Director Michael Camdessus payed a three-day visit
to Nigeria last week. He said that IMF was unsatisfied with the
implementation of the IMF recommended Structural Adjustment
Program (SAP) in the West African country.
</P>
<P>
He denounced the idea hold by many Nigerians that the SAP has
impoverished Nigerians and left the country's economy in shambles.
He said, in fact, Nigeria has never started the process of SAP.
</P>
<P>
Camdessus told Nigeria's labor leaders that Nigerian government
and IMF designed a program for structural adjustment which was to
be carried out by the government.
</P>
<P>
"But soon after the signing of the agreement, the Nigerian
government went the opposite direction and this led to our not
making financial commitments to the program," he added.
</P>
<P>
Comrade Oshimhole, President of the Nigerian Labour Congress,
told the IMF chief that the structural adjustment program attached
with IMF conditions has led to the devaluation of Nigeria's
currency and the removal of subsidies.
</P>
<P>
The debate raging on for a long time in the country is whether
SAP in its design was badly managed or whether it is faulty in its
totality, according to This Day newspaper.

<HEADLINE> New Forest Areas To Protect Yangtze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The forestry coverage rate in
Southwest China's Sichuan Province is to exceed 36 percent within
50 years, an area of more than 17.4 million hectares, according to
provincial government officials.
</P>
<P>
And they say this will assist the prevention of soil erosion
along the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, China's longest.
</P>
<P>
An afforestation project for the whole province will be
launched soon and officials say the forestry area will then reach
over 15 million hectares, around 63 percent of the total projected
area. Meanwhile, forests grown for profits will cover 5.32 million
hectares; the remainder will be used for both purposes.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan Province is located along the upper reaches of the
Yangtze River, and currently forestry covers some 11.7 million
hectares, about 24 percent of the whole area.
</P>
<P>
The forest area in its western part is one of the three largest
in China, which helps maintain water resources along an important
section of the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
However, a recent survey shows that the soil erosion in the
province has increased from 60,000 sq km in the 1950s to 110,000
square kilometers today and experts reckon that as a result there
could be 600 million tons of mud and sand entering into the Three
Gorges area every year.
</P>
<P>
However, they believe that the forestry project will settle
the problem of soil erosion once and for all along the river's
upper reaches, halting its decline into another Yellow River,
which suffers serious soil erosion problems.

<HEADLINE> Serbian President Explains Reason for Kosovo Talk Breakdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia's Serbia republic
President Milan Milutinovic said on Monday that the reason for the
Serbian delegation to rejecting the peace agreement on Kosovo is
that it has not been discussed.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the French conservative daily "La Croix"
published on Monday, Milutinovic said that not a single article of
the agreement was discussed with the Serbian delegates during the
talks on Kosovo in Paris last week.
</P>
<P>
"No, we did not reject it, because there is no agreement. How
can we sign a document which was imposed to us and not a single
article of it has been discussed?" he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Serb side was ready to sign a political
agreement on enlarged autonomy in Kosovo, but the three
international mediators refused to include some amendments as were
required by the Serbs, although they had orally promised to do so.
</P>
<P>
"There is a whole series of questions (in the agreement),
including the referendum, the constitution, the judicial system,
the legislative power, the presidency of Kosovo and above all
equality among all ethnic communities," he said.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the points disputed by the Serb side in the
peace agreement signed by the Kosovo Albanians in Paris on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic reaffirmed Belgrade's opposition to the deployment
of a NATO force in Kosovo, and said that if NATO attacks, the
Serbs will defend themselves.
</P>
<P>
On the capacity of Belgrade to solve the conflict in Kosovo,
the president said that the Yugoslav authorities were on the point
of ending it in September 1998 but "someone pushed the button and
created the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) which did not exist
before.''
</P>
<P>
"We did our best to avoid a military solution, but if people
push us in this way we would not have other choice," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that if NATO attacks Serb forces, the KLA would be
eliminated by the 30,000 Yugoslav troops deployed in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
He also compared Kosovo with the French island of Corsica,
where some nationalist militants have been fighting for the
independence of the island from France since 1970s.
</P>
<P>
"Kosovo would remain part of Serbia as Corsica would remain
part of France," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the appeal by Russia on the Serbs for signing the political
agreement on Kosovo, Milutinovic said that the Russians had
clearly not read the document and they should read it.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Cut Daily Oil Exports by 100,000 Barrels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Ministry of Fuel and
Energy announced Monday that it will cut oil exports by 100,000
barrels a day as of April 1, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said the decision was made to support the OPEC
decision to reduce oil production by 2 million barrels a day and
to increase deliveries to domestic refineries to guarantee an
increase in their output.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after world crude oil prices jumped to
their highest levels in five months last week, which boosted hopes
for more foreign exchange earnings for Russia's impoverished, oil-
dependent economy.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, the price for international benchmark Brent
crude shot up to 13.87 U.S. dollars per barrel, up from the
historic lows of under 10 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
Low oil prices, primarily a result of the Asian financial
crisis that started in the fall of 1997, have made an already
difficult financial situation much worse for Russia, which has
long relied on the export of its natural resources to survive.
</P>
<P>
Last year alone, Russia lost 6.2 billion dollars because of the
fall in world oil prices, Fuel and Energy Minister Sergei
Generalov said last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Energy exports account for about half of Russia's export
earnings and taxes on oil exports make up nearly a quarter of the
federal budget's hard-currency revenues.

<HEADLINE> Essay Contest Angers Chengdu Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese-funded Ito Yokatoh
department store in the southwest China city of Chengdu has been
forced to abandon a promotion campaign which local residents
claimed was designed to plant misconceptions about Japan in the
minds of young Chinese.
</P>
<P>
The store recently announced plans to sponsor an essay contest
on the theme "Japan - A beautiful country in my heart". Teenagers
under the age of 18 years were eligible to win prizes ranging from
20 to 350 yuan.
</P>
<P>
The contest came under an immediate barrage of criticism from
local residents who contacted the local news media expressing
anger and indignation.
</P>
<P>
"I'm 60 years old and personally experienced the pains invading
Japanese forces inflicted on Chinese people. The younger
generation has no idea about what happened!" according to an
elderly Chengdu resident named Liu.
</P>
<P>
"Asking Chinese teenagers to write about 'the beautiful Japan
in their hearts' is quite simply inducing children to lie," said
Liu.
</P>
<P>
A local university professor urged the local government to
introduce measures to prevent activities designed to "misguide the
younger generation".
</P>
<P>
A number of Chengdu residents claimed the essay contest
featured "political elements which harmed the sensibilities of
Chinese people".
</P>
<P>
The store's general manager has canceled the contest and
apologized to Chengdu residents.

<HEADLINE> Article Addresses Pre-1959 Human Rights in Tibet (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The overseas edition of today's
People's Daily carried an article on pre-1959 human rights
conditions in Tibet written by Zhou Runnian.
</P>
<P>
The 14th Dalai Lama, the ruler of Tibet prior to 1959, and his
followers referred to the region as "the most beautiful and
holiest paradise in the world". However, the fruits of the so-
called paradise were enjoyed only by the wealthy class which
accounted for a mere five percent of the total population in the
region.
</P>
<P>
What then was the status of the remaining 95 percent of
Tibetans? Did they enjoy the same human rights as the wealthy?
The 16-Article Code in place in the region from the early 17th
century to 1959 provides the best answers to the aforementioned
questions.
</P>
<P>
The 16-Article Code, created early in the 17th century during
the Garma regime, covers military, civil and administrative
affairs, as well as degrees of punishment, production and life.
The Code, drafted on the basis of the 15-Article Code introduced
by the Pagmo Zhuba regime, the Sangzhuze Code and various local
regulations, was followed by successive generations of Tibetan
rulers.
</P>
<P>
The 13-Article Code enforced during the reign of various Dalai
Lamas was also based on 16-Article Code. Despite some difference
between the two in the order of articles and explanations, The two
codes nonetheless are basically the same in terms of content. Both
codes protect the interests of three estate holders in Tibet --
the nobility, monasteries and officialdom.

Monks enjoyed more legal rights than ordinary lay people and
judges rendered judgments according to will of Buddha.
</P>
<P>
For example, the judge in one particular case ordered the
accuser and the accused to swear a vow in front of the statue of
Buddha. A pot of boiling oil containing black and white stones was
placed in front of the litigants and the one who retrieved a white
stone won the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
The Code specified cruel and unusual punishment for serfs and
slaves. One man accused of fashioning fake gold objects was forced
to stand in the searing heat while holding a handful of salt and a
stone. The man cried aloud for help within a short period of time
as blood flowed. The man suffered from crippling injuries within
three days.
</P>
<P>
The Namzexag, the law enforcement agency in Lhasa during the
period of old Tibet, developed over 50 pieces of equipment for
punishment. The agency's top floor was used as an interrogation
and torture center, while the prisoners held in the basement were
fettered and shackled both night and day. Dozens of prisoners were
sometimes shackled together.

The 16-Article Code contained the following basic provisions:
</P>
<P>
(1) Legal guarantees for serf-owners and restrictions on the
personal rights of serfs and slaves.
</P>
<P>
The 16-Article Code was formulated to deprive serfs and slaves,
groups which accounted for 95 percent of the total Tibetan
population, of any rights and staunchly defended the interests of
the three estate holders.

<P>
Serf-owners, the rulers of Tibet who enacted and strictly

segments of Tibetan society. They protected their own interests
and their will be prevailed in the face of any conflicts regarding
the Code.

pay an indemnity equal to 80 times the value of the stolen

indemnity equal to between 7-9 times the stolen property."

Article 10 covering injuries inflicted on other people reads: "
inflicting injuries on other people shall be dealt with in a
different manner. Individuals responsible for injuring officials
shall be subject to the loss of either a hand or foot in
accordance with the seriousness of the injury inflicted. In
accidental injury cases involving a master and servant, the former
shall not be found guilty, but shall be required to provide
medical treatment for the latter."

<HEADLINE> Primakov: Russia Prevents Leakage of Missile Technologies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov said Monday that his country abides by its international
commitments on the export of missile technologies in preventing
the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
"I can say definitively and clearly that we are doing
everything to prevent leakage of weapons of mass destruction,"
Primakov told reporters after meeting here with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is abiding by absolutely every international standard
concerning export. This policy has not changed," he said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who arrived here Sunday on a brief working visit,
was reportedly urging the Russians to stop the alleged transfer of
weapons technology to Iran.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said that to the best of his knowledge, Iran does not
have missiles which could strike Israel, Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
It is his duty to do his best to prevent Iran from obtaining
weapons that could threaten Israel, Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers agreed to set up an economic guarantees
fund in each country, and representatives to the funds will soon
be appointed, Netanyahu said, describing Israeli-Russian relations
are excellent.
</P>
<P>
"I can confirm everything that Mr. Netanyahu has said,"
Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
"There is a political will to keep the cooperation developing,"
Primakov said. He quoted Netanyahu as saying that Russia should
step up its role in the Middle East "in keeping with tradition and
opportunities."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who visited Ukraine before coming here, will leave
for Georgia later Monday.

The Code required serfs and slaves engaged in collecting
firewood in the mountains belonging to serf owners to pay taxes.
</P>
<P>
Serfs and slaves were also subject to numerous taxes. For
example, rules of the Grand Summons Ceremony required serfs and
slaves to pay taxes for raising horses, brewing wine, cultivating
flowers, listening to music and growing pigtails.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the period show that taxes consumed between 40-
70 percent of total earnings for serfs and slaves. The rich gained
wealth, while the poor accumulated tremendous debt burdens which
remained outstanding for several generations.
</P>

Some 37,000 people, including 5,000 beggars, lived in Lhasa,

3) Defending the legal status of feudal serf-owners, while
depriving the vast majority of Tibetans of any right to

</P>
<P>
Slave-owners in pre-1959 Tibet enjoyed legal rights and
interests according to the Code. The wealthy class took full
advantage of the fact that most Tibetans were Buddhists and
managed to ensure the deification of their legal rights and
interests.
</P>
<P>
Any move to offend the rights and interests of the rich was
considered to be an offense against Buddha and was subject to
punishment according to the will of Buddha and the Code.

<HEADLINE> Australian-Japanese Talks Fail to Resolve Rice Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- High-level talks between Japan
and Australia in Canberra Monday failed to dislodge Japan's
punishing 390-percent tariff on rice imports from Australia.
</P>
<P>
But Australian Trade Minister Tim Fischer and Japanese Minister
of International Trade and Industry Kaoru Yosano both insisted the
row would not affect the relations between the two nations, and
flagged joint action against the United States over steel import
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
Even before the talks began, Yosano announced that Japan had no
intention of lowering the tariff and expressed surprise and regret
at Australia's decision to lodge an official protest with the
World Trade Organization (WTO), the Australian Financial Review
(AFR) reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Australia is far from satisfied with the level of the tariff
Japan is proposing on out-of-quota imports," Fischer told
reporters after the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Australia has already grabbed a 42-million-U.S.-dollar slice of
the small section of the rice market Japan was forced to open to
imports by the WTO.
</P>
<P>
However, Fischer, who is also deputy prime minister and head of
the National Party of Australia representing Australian farmers,
said the tariff imposed on the rest of the market, which equates
to almost 3.2 U.S. dollars per kilogram, has been unfairly
calculated using cheaper rice, and not the high-quality Australian
product.
</P>
<P>
In determining the tariff rate, Japan chose a cheap, non-milled
Thai rice used principally for industrial purposes, instead of a
higher priced table rice of higher quality, AFR said.
</P>
<P>
Yosano insisted that the methodology is strictly in line with
WTO guidelines, but Monday offered further talks to ensure the row
do not affect the relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that this issue should not ... impact on the good
overall bilateral relationship," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Despite the major disagreement over rice, both ministers
insisted the overall relationship remains in good shape and
reinforced the message with a joint attack on a U.S. proposal to
restrict steel imports.
</P>
<P>
"Australia absolutely rejects any submission or contention that
we have been dumping directly or indirectly steel product on the
U.S. market," Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
Australian steel exports to the United States soared from 120
million U.S. dollars to 210 million U.S. dollars last financial
year.
</P>
<P>
U.S. restrictions on Japanese steel imports would also
indirectly hurt Australia because much of Japan's steel is made
from Australian raw materials.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Set Up National Shipping Fleet </HEADLINE>

<P>
BANGKOK, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is trying to set up its
first national shipping fleet to help boost the country's
international market shares of transport and revenue, Transport
and Communications Minister Suthep Thueksuban said Monday.
</P>
<P>
He said the government hopes to establish the fleet by early
this year.
</P>
<P>
Thailand now has 30 shippers with vessels registered in the
country and they only share 11 percent of international shipping
volumes, which totaled 119 million tonnes last year.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's merchant fleet has only 3.2 million deadweight
tonnes, compared with 6.12 million in Malaysia, 14 million in the
Philippines and 25.7 million in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The planned establishment of the national shipping fleet is
part of the government's measures introduced to improve and
develop the country's merchant fleet, Suthep told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The other measures included amending ship-registration
procedures to encourage local shipping companies to register their
vessels at home instead of in other countries, and providing more
sources of soft loans with reasonable costs for local shippers, he
said.

LISBON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Scotsman Colin McRae continued his

McRae, driving his new Ford Focus, won the first of the day's

McRae finished the stage nearly 13 seconds quicker than Burns

His win in that event left him just 10 points behind defending

<HEADLINE> Russia Repeats Opposition to Use of Force on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov on Monday reiterated Moscow's opposition to the use of
force against Belgrade over conflicts in Yugoslavia's Kosovo
province.
</P>
<P>
"We are categorically opposed to the use of force in Yugoslavia
and hope there will be no bombings," Primakov told reporters after
a meeting here with visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
He said he does not want the situation in Kosovo "to go to the
extreme limit."
</P>
<P>
The use of force will "have an enormous destabilizing effect on
the overall situation in Europe, not just in Yugoslavia and Kosovo,
" Primakov said.
</P>
<P>
"The instruments of political influence are far from being
exhausted," he said. "The sides should be brought to the
negotiating table, compelled to advance along the road of mutual
concessions and compromise."
</P>
<P>
Primakov said he is strongly against the Contact Group passing
on its responsibilities to other organizations that want to settle
the question with the use of military force because "this question
cannot be settled by military means."
</P>
<P>
Russia is a member of the six-nation Contact Group on the
former Yugoslavia. Other members are Britain, France, Germany,
Italy and the United States.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Russian envoy Boris Mayorsky, who
took part in the Paris talks on Kosovo, has left for Belgrade in
an effort to avert a possible military strike on Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Mayorsky is expected to meet Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, the Itar-Tass news agency reported, quoting sources
with the Russian Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Tension is high in the Balkans amid heightened airstrike
threats made by the United States and its NATO allies after
Belgrade refused to sign on a peace deal that would require the
stationing of foreign troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke has been sent
to Yugoslavia to deliver a "final warning" to Milosevic on looming
airstrikes by NATO forces.
</P>
<P>
Russia has been adamant in opposing the use of force by the U.S.
-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization against Belgrade. Moscow
insists that the presence of foreign troops in Kosovo must have
the consent of Belgrade and be sanctioned by the U.N. Security
Council.

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Manufacturing Output Drops Slow Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Philippine manufacturers are
gradually increasing output as indicated by the slowing down of
year-on-year declines in the value and volume of production in the
sector for the past few months.
</P>
<P>
National Statistics Office data showed that production for
January 1999 dropped by 2.5 percent in value and 3.7 percent in
volume from last year, but it increased by 6.6 percent in value
and 6.5 percent in volume from the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The country's manufacturers have moved to increase output since
November last year in an effort to replenish draw-down inventories
and to meet anticipated increase in export and domestic demand,
the office said.
</P>
<P>
For January, the value of net sales plunged by 12.2 percent
from a year earlier and its corresponding volume by 19 percent, it
said.
</P>
<P>
During the period, gainers in both value and volume of
production were wood and wood products, rubber products, textile,
transport equipment and electrical machinery.
</P>
<P>
Wood and wood products posted a 63.2 percent uptick in value
and 59.1 percent increase in volume of production while that of
rubber recorded an increase of 50.3 percent and 32.1 percent in
value and volume of production, the office said.
</P>
<P>
The office attributed the drop in production mainly to declines
posted by petroleum products, wearing apparel, basic metals,
non-metallic mineral products and chemicals.
</P>
<P>
Capacity utilization, the ratio of output to the maximum rated
capacity of a plant, was almost the same as a year ago, it said.
</P>
<P>
Forty percent of the firms are operating below 70 percent of
their utilization and about 17 percent operating at full capacity.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Behari Vajpayee said Monday that his country wants to develop a
relationship of peace and friendship with Pakistan and resolve all
outstanding issues between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee made the remarks in a message to Pakistani Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif on the occasion of the National Day of
Pakistan which will be observed on March 23.
</P>
<P>
"We wish to work together with your government to develop a
relationship of peace and friendship with Pakistan, put in place a
comprehensive structure of cooperation for the benefit of our two
peoples and resolve all outstanding issues," Vajpayee said.
</P>
<P>
"It is now incumbent upon us to translate our recent
initiatives for the welfare of the peoples of our two countries
into reality," he said in reference to his last month's landmark
bus ride to Lahore, capital of Pakistan's Punjab province, and the
signing of the Lahore Declaration last month which calls for
intensified efforts to resolve Jammu and Kashmir and other
contentious issues.
</P>
<P>
"I retain fond memories of my visit to Lahore and your very
warm and gracious hospitality offered to my delegation and
myself," the Indian prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
He also wished good for the progress and prosperity of the
people of Pakistan.
</P>

on the basis of the recent initiatives undertaken by the two
countries to pave way for the improvement of bilateral ties.
</P>

"I wish to convey through you to the government and people of
Pakistan India's deep desire for peace and friendship and for
developing a comprehensive structure of cooperation for the
welfare of our two peoples," he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Needs Water Conservation Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will need a Water
Conservation Network to keep the ecological balance and preserve
diminishing water resources, a discussion of environment concluded
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The idea to establish the Network is being proposed during the
panel discussion to commemorate World Water Day on March 22.
</P>
<P>
The discussion was organized by Aqua Partners Foundation and
the United Nation Information Center (UNIC) office in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
Former Environment Minister Emil Salim said the idea to
establish the network is important for Indonesia, as more water
conservation has set up, while there are no serious efforts to
preserve it.
</P>
<P>
To date, many government policies and law enforcement programs
have not supported the formation of water conservation. The result
of this is the lack of water resources and furthermore, scarcity
of clean water.
</P>
<P>
"There is no news about new fertile land, new springs or
rivers. On the contrary, there are more water resources polluted,"
Salim said.
</P>
<P>
The idea to establish a Water Conservation Network has gained
support from government officials, non governmental organizations,
and also academicians.
</P>
<P>
In the future, Salim said, water scarcity will be a serious
problem for people in the city, especially with further sea water
intrusion onto land, which could wipe off the plain water supply.
</P>
<P>
Clean water scarcity has not only been faced by Indonesia, but
also by developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Some 2.3 billion people, or 30 percent of the world's
population in 48 countries, are suffering from clean water
scarcity, Salim said.
</P>
<P>
"The worst part is that one third of the world's population
live in regions which only receive one fourth of the total world's
rainfall," Salim added.

<HEADLINE> Manila Suspends Anti-Rebel Operations Until </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Monday announced the suspension of military operations
against the New People's Army (NPA), effective March 28 until the
date of release of the four military and police officers abducted
by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said in a statement that the suspension will not
include normal police and law enforcement operations and it only
covers areas that would be affected by the release efforts.
</P>
<P>
The NPA has said that they will release the hostages between
March 22 and April 19.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said the decision of the NPA to release the hostages is
a vindication of the government policy that any release "must be
immediate, unconditional and unilateral."
</P>
<P>
Estrada suspended formal peace talks with the NPA following the
abduction of army general Victor Obillo, his aide Eduardo, and
police inspector Roberto Bernal Montealto last month.
</P>
<P>
The rebels also abducted army sergeant Alipio Lozada this
month.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Help Settle Israel-Jordan Water Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Israel and Jordan have sought
the U.S. mediation of a mounting crisis resulting from Israel's
proposal to cut water supplies to the desert kingdom, Haaretz
daily reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. State Department water expert has come to Israel and is
expected to travel on to Jordan as part of efforts to find an
solution acceptable to both sides, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The water dispute broke out a week ago after Israel announced
that it will slash by half its annual allocation of water to
Jordan due to a severe drought in the region.
</P>
<P>
Jordan rejected the water provision reduction and considered it
unacceptable and a violation of the 1994 peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
Jordan lacks the rivers of neighboring Syria, Turkey, Egypt and
Iraq and the money of the oil-rich Gulf for desalination. Water
shortage is all the more evident in torrid summer.
</P>
<P>
As part of the 1994 peace treaty, Israel initially agreed to
supply Jordan 30 million cubic meters of water. A subsequent 1997
agreement between late King Hussein and Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu gave Jordan an additional 25 million cubic
meters.
</P>
<P>
The water comes from the Yarmouk River and the Sea of Galilee,
whose water levels have dropped to decades-low due to the severe
drought over the past winter.
</P>
<P>
Amman insisted that the water deal is an official agreement
and should be implemented as it is. Talks between the two sides on
the issue are currently deadlocked.
</P>
<P>
The water dispute is the first bump in relations between Israel
and Jordan since King Abdullah Bin Hussein, the late King
Hussein's eldest son, took the throne early last month.
</P>
<P>
Israeli officials say the Americans recognize "that it is a
case of emergency distress."

PARIS, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Monday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- After the departure of observers of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the Yugoslav
authorities are deploying troops in Kosovo in a major offensive
against the ethnic Albanian separatist force -- the Kosovo
Liberation Army (KLA). The civilians are fleeing their homes in a
major exodus.
</P>
<P>
-- The Netherlands is organizing the biggest ever trial of drug
trafficker in history starting on Monday, bringing to court the
former military strongman of the former Dutch colony Surinam, Desi
Bouterse, who was accused of smuggling one ton and a half of
cocaine to the Netherlands and Belgium from 1989 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The Yugoslav military and police forces have been launching
a major offensive against the ethnic Albanian separatist force the
KLA in Kosovo since Saturday in a bid to crush the Albanian
rebellion. Meanwhile, human rights groups have accused Serb police
of having arrested 200 ethnic Albanians in Pristina.
</P>
<P>
-- The European Parliament has been blamed for costing too much
money and lacking transparency by some Euro deputies. The
Strasbourg-based parliament spends 1.5 million francs (250,000 U.S.
dollars) each year on its 626 deputies, 600,000 francs (100,000
dollars) more than 10 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Macedonia Says No to NATO Using Its Land for Attacks on Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Macedonian Foreign Minister
Aleksandar Dimitrov has affirmed that his country will not allow
NATO to use its territory for attacking Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Dimitrov made the remarks at a news conference in the capital
city of Skopje on Sunday, which was the first time for the current
government to make clear its stand on this issue since it was
formed last November, the Macedonian Information Agency reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The previous government had declared more than once its
rejection to allowing NATO to use Macedonia's territory for the
attack, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Dimitrov also pointed out that as it would be unlikely for the
Kosovar ethnic Albanians and the Serbs to reach agreement, the
conflict in Kosovo would extend to the territory of Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
There are now 10,000 NATO troops in Macedonia, ready to move
into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks on Kosovo in Paris failed last Friday after
Yugoslavia refused to sign the interim agreement, which offers
substantial autonomy to the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and
requires Western troops to "monitor peace implementation" in the
region. Yugoslavia and other countries say the agreement violates
Yugoslavia's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Since the breakup of the talks, the United States and its major
NATO allies have intensified their threats to launch massive air-
strikes against Yugoslav military targets if Belgrade does not
compromise.

</P>
<P>
Li Xiaolin, vice-president of CPAFFC, at a handover ceremony,

activist and bridge builder of the friendship between China and
New Zealand, and a devoted friend of the Chinese people."
</P>
<P>
"Alley firmly supported the Chinese people in their just cause
of striving for emancipation and freedom," Li said, adding that
the collection would provide the New Zealand people with an
opportunity to have a deep understanding of Alley and would help
enhance the friendship between the people of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
When Alley was alive, he entrusted CPAFFC to handle all his
matters after his death and he passed away in China in 1987.
</P>
<P>
The collection includes over 10,000 letters, a large number of
diaries, published and unpublished manuscripts and pictures.
</P>

of New Zealand, will receive and keep the collection.

<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The winners of the 71st
annual Academy Awards were announced on the Oscar Ceremony
conducted here Sunday night.
</P>
<P>

young Bard's affections.
</P>

MAPUTO, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano has urged the inclusion of the disabled in the society
like anybody else since they are capable of making contributions

Association of Disabled Soldiers, which projects to teach the
disabled certain skills to enable them to make a living by

The president called on the whole society to treat fairly the
disabled, instead of discriminating them or regarding them as
second-class citizens.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican government has been making efforts in training
the disabled in coordination with the Labor Ministry so as to
ensure their better integration into the society.
</P>
<P>
Chissano announced that a total of 3,000 disabled soldiers will
get vocational training under the government's integration program
of social action, employment and youth which is aimed at enhancing
the sense of dignity and value on the part of the disabled.

DAR ES SALAAM, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has opened the
iridium satellite telephone service which makes it the first
country in Africa to communicate with any part of the world using
a mobile wireless phone.
</P>
<P>
The iridium service in Tanzania is expected to stimulate its
economy by providing easy communication to mining, manufacturing
and tourism industries, a senior official of the Iridium Africa
Corporation said here at a launching ceremony over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian newspaper Monday quoted James Rege, director of
government and regulatory affairs of the Iridium Africa
Corporation, as saying that there have already been a lot of
inquiries about the service.
</P>
<P>
"Tanzania is one of the largest countries in the region and we
believe that the iridium system will be particularly useful to
mining and tourist companies, which operate outside the main hubs
where there are currently no telecommunications," he said.
</P>
<P>
Covering the globe by 66 low-earth-orbit satellites with
land-based cellular networks, the system can provide mobile
telephone voice, data facsimile and alphanumeric paging signals to
every corner of the world.
</P>
<P>
Rege said his corporation will provide three phones to the
Tanzanian government for emergency communication and disaster
relief.
</P>
<P>
The Planetel Communication Limited based in Dar es Salaam, he
said, has become the first Tanzanian as well as African provider
to offer the iridium system service.
</P>
<P>
"Another Tanzanian company, the Tritel Communications, has also
entered into an agreement with Iridium Africa Corporation to be
the cellular roaming partner," Rege added.
</P>
<P>
With a Motorola-led investment of 1.2 billion U.S. dollars, the
iridium satellite telephone system targets mainly sectors of
governments, military, large corporate companies, oil and gas
production, exploration, mining, cargo shipping, power generation,
commercial fishing, construction as well as the mass media which
need constant communication.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Sugar Firm Takes Steps Against Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Sugar, the biggest sugar
producer in the country, has joined the international community in
commemorating World Water Day Monday by taking a series of steps
against pollution effects.
</P>
<P>
The sugar company's response to the theme is: "Everybody lives
downstream of the Kafue River."
</P>
<P>
Zambia Sugar, located in Southern Province, solely depends on
the Kafue waters to irrigate nearly 11,000 hectares of land to
grow 1.17 million tons of sugar cane annually, which is in turn
processed to produce more than 180, 000 tons of refined sugar.
</P>
<P>
It provides employment to about 6,500 people who also rely on
the Kafue River for domestic water supply through 3,050 households
within the estates. The water supply service is also extended to
more than 2,000 households in the area.
</P>
<P>
Sugar is one of the major food commodities in Zambia, which
earns the nation revenue through tax as well as foreign exchange
through export.
</P>
<P>
The company is aware of the many uses of Kafue waters by
everybody that lives downstream. For this cause, the company has
put in place mitigation measures against pollution that could
result from factory effluent, solid waste and gaseous emissions.
</P>
<P>
The objectives of the steps taken by the company are to
maximize quality sugar production per amount of irrigation water
applied by recycling drainage water with maximum care for the
environment; to minimize contaminants in process effluent at the
point of discharge into the aquatic environment, to levels
acceptable under the Water Pollution Control Regulations, of the
Environmental Protection and Pollution Control Act (EPPCA)1990.
</P>
<P>
The company will also provide containment systems in order to
reduce inflows of factory spillage into the aquatic environment
via drains and to utilize artificially constructed wetlands in the
treatment of waste water, prior to discharge into the aquatic
environment.

<HEADLINE> Russian Envoy to Meet Milosevic on Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian envoy Boris Mayorsky, who
took part in the Paris talks on Kosovo, has left for Belgrade in
an effort to break the deadlock in the peace process in the
troubled Yugoslav province, the Itar-Tass news agency reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Mayorsky is expected to meet Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic, Tass said, quoting sources with the Russian Foreign
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Tension is high in the Balkans amid heightened airstrike
threats made by the United States and its NATO allies after
Belgrade refused to sign on a peace deal that would require the
stationing of foreign troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke has been sent
to Yugoslavia to deliver a "final warning" to Milosevic on looming
airstrikes by NATO forces.
</P>
<P>
Russia has been adamant in opposing the use of force by the U.S.
-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) against Belgrade.
Moscow insists that the presence of foreign troops in Kosovo must
have the consent of Belgrade and be sanctioned by the UN Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
Holbrooke's mission was the last chance for Yugoslavia to avert a
military attack.
</P>
<P>
Since the Paris peace talks broke down last Friday, Washington
and its major NATO allies have heightened their airstrike threats
against Yugoslavia, but Belgrade has shown no signs of compromise.
</P>
<P>
So far, most of the dependents of Western countries' embassy
staffs in Belgrade and the observers of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in Kosovo have been
withdrawn.

<HEADLINE> Female Author Covers Tibetan Topics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Works on Tibet penned by female
author Ma Lihua, 46, were rejected by most publishers a short 10
years ago but are now attracting an increasing readership
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Ma was born in the eastern Shandong Province, the home of
famous Confucius, journeyed to Tibet at the age of 23 and has
traveled extensively in the region for the past 20-odd years.
</P>
<P>
The noted author has visited almost every corner of Tibet and
has established lasting friendship with hundreds of local
villagers, herdsman, scholars and officials.
</P>
<P>
Four reprints of Ma's work "Journey in Tibet", published in
1994, have sold 120,000 copies.
</P>
<P>
Tibet emerged as one of China's most popular tourist
destinations in the wake of the reform and opening policies.
</P>
<P>
"To me, Tibet means clean blue skies, white clouds and
kindhearted people," said Ma.
</P>
<P>
"I'm interested in everything about Tibet and will treasure my
experiences in the region forever," according to the author.
</P>
<P>
"Journey in Tibet" recounts Ma's travels, observations,
thoughts and feelings about the plateau region and local
inhabitants.
</P>
<P>
"The work, which portrays a remote, old and colorful world,
provides readers with a better understanding of Tibetan culture.
Ma recounts her personal experience and feelings from the
standpoint of literature and anthropology," according to one
Beijing scholar.
</P>
<P>
"The splendid nature of Tibet has enabled me to establish my
own position in society, and I've witnessed improvements and
changes on an almost daily basis," said Ma.
</P>
<P>
She noted that "things continue to change dramatically as Lhasa
continues to open wider to the outside world."

<HEADLINE> Kenyan President Happy with Anti-Graft Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan president Daniel arap Moi
Sunday praised the country's police for their good performance in
cracking down on graft, which is a malignant tumor in the
government.
</P>
<P>
During a meet-the-people tour in Kangemi of Nairobi Province,
Moi told thousands of residents that "the police are doing a good
job in cracking down on corruption."
</P>
<P>
The president attributed the positive results of the crusade to
the recent changes in the government and the reinforcement of the
police in this field.
</P>
<P>
Moi warned corrupt civil servants that "their days were
numbered".
</P>
<P>
Many Kenyan officials and observers believe that corruption is
one of the major causes for the poverty of the country.
</P>
<P>
Moi said programs have been set up to combat poverty within the
 framework of the recently launched poverty eradication plan.
</P>
<P>
He also emphasized that eradication of poverty can not be
achieved without peace.
</P>
<P>
He said that most neighboring countries have been torn apart by
civil strife and unnecessary wars, citing Somalia, Ethiopia,
Eritrea and Rwanda as examples.

<HEADLINE> Vietnamese Takes Measures to Increase Rice Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese government has taken
measures to increase exporting rice, local press reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam exported more than 600,000 tones of rice in the first
75 days of 1999, according to Vietnam's Trade Ministry.
</P>
<P>
However, Vietnam plans to export 820,000-850,000 tones of rice
in the first quarter of this year, 61.5 percent of last year's
figure.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam exported 422,000 tones of rice in January and February,
equal to 83 percent of the volume exported during the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
According to Vietnam's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development, farmers across the country have had a good
winter-spring crop despite severe drought. Particularly, the
Vietnam's southern Mekong delta provinces are expected to harvest
7.1 million tones of winter-spring rice.
</P>
<P>
Rice is one of Vietnam's main exports. Vietnam was the second
largest rice exporter in the world last year.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese government is encouraging its all exporters to use
up their rice export quotas before the end of April and has asked
commercial banks to keep sufficient cash ready to help them
purchase all the rice harvested this year.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's rice exporters are also permitted to extend the
duration of temporary rice storage by two months and have a target
of purchasing an additional 500,000 tones of rice before April 15.

<HEADLINE> China Welcomes Inclusion of Synchronized Diving to Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Diving powerhouse China greeted
Sunday the incorporation of the Synchronised diving into the
Sdyney Olympic Games by the International Olympic Committee (IOC).
</P>
<P>
Zhou Jihong, head of the national diving squad, said that she
was pleased at the acceptance by IOC and held a rosy view of the
future of the synchronized diving.
</P>
<P>
"It is a big delight for diving, for this means the
synchronized diving won wider attention and it will develop more
rapidly," Zhou said.
</P>
<P>
FINA, the swimming ruling body, said on Saturday that the IOC
executive board has accepted the proposal from the organisers of
the 2000 Sydney Games to add two synchronised diving events
including three-meter and 10-meter boards for both women and men
to the event.
</P>
<P>
Zhou said that its increasing popularity in the world for its
spectacle has been a factor for its inclusion in the Olympic
programs.
</P>
<P>
The rapid progress made by Australia in the event, highlighted
by the four silver medals in World Cup this year, also pushed the
adoption by the IOC.
</P>
<P>
"Under the joint efforts of the host and FINA, the
incorporation process was accelerated" she added.
</P>
<P>
Synchronized diving, recognized since 1995, is now included in
most major international competitions including the world
championships.
</P>
<P>
The event involves divers plunging into the water side by side
from either the 10-meter platform or from parallel 3-meter
springboards. The divers are judged on individual technical skills
and the ability to coordinate their movements and enter the water
together.
</P>
<P>
China has showed its dominance in this field when they grabbed
most titles in World Cup events. Even when China diving suffered a
slump, the synchronized divers even claimed two men's titles in
the World Swimming Championships in Perth early last year and
swept all four titles at the World Cup this year.
</P>
<P>
But Zhou was less circumspect, saying the inclusion will incur
more intense competition.
</P>
<P>
"After IOC accepted the proposal, such countries as Russia, the
United States, Canada, Mexico, will give more attention to the
event."
</P>
<P>
"We should keep somber-minded and redouble our efforts, for we
actually do not enjoy much advantage as we think."

<HEADLINE> OAU to Discuss Horn of Africa Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Eritrea has appealed to the 69th
Ministerial Council Session of the Organization of Africa Unity
(OAU) convening in Addis Ababa Monday to discuss the border
conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia at a neutral venue
acceptable to both member states.
</P>
<P>
The OAU meeting is scheduled to discuss administrative and
budgetary issues of the organization, but Eritrea believes that
the Council could well seize the raging conflict between Eritrea
and Ethiopia in view of its urgency and gravity, said a release
issued by the Eritrean Foreign Ministry available here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The release said, "Eritrea cannot possibly attend the session
to argue its case in the capital of a country that has currently
unleashed a war of aggression against it by violating its
inherited colonial boundaries and illegally re-drawn Eritrea's
international boundaries to curve out and incorporate large
tracts of its territory."
</P>
<P>
Eritrean Foreign Ministry pointed out in the release that the
implementation of the OAU Framework on the conflict remained
blocked by Ethiopia's new preconditions which are in clear
contradiction to the letter and spirit of the OAU Framework.
</P>
<P>
The OAU Framework was articulated by a high-level delegation
and fully endorsed by the Central Organ in its Summit in
Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, on December 17, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The release said that Eritrea maintains that the Framework is
not "an elastic framework susceptible to altering interpretations
on the basis of perceived or real changes in the battlefield".

KAMPALA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Uganda Commercial Bank, the

accomplished, completion date being May 31, 1999," it said.
</P>
<P>
The sole objective of these measures is to ensure all computers

Uganda has paid due attention to this Millennium Bug although
it does not have so many computers. A national Y2K awareness
campaign was launched on March 9 and a task force was established
to tackle the problem.

BELGRADE -- In face of heightened air-strike threats made by
the United States and its NATO allies, Commander of the Third Army
of Yugoslavia, Nebojsa Pavkovic, said on Sunday that the Yugoslav
army is now on high alert against any foreign aggression.
</P>
<P>
Pavkovic inspected Yugoslavia's air defense force, armored
force and the Yugoslav frontier force in Nishon on the border with
Macedonia, local media reports said. Meanwhile, U.S. special envoy
Richard Holbrooke has been sent to Yugoslavia to deliver a "final
warning" to President Slobodan Milosevic on looming air-strikes by
NATO forces. (Yugoslavia-Commander-Kosovo)

The memo was reached after Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma

BUCHAREST -- Romanian President Emil Constantinescu, in a
statement issued on Sunday, urged Yugoslavia to make concessions
on the Kosovo crisis by signing the Interim Agreement for Peace
and Self-Government in Kosovo proposed by the six-nation Contact
Group on former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing that peace talks may represent a last opportunity
for a political settlement of the crisis, the president said the
Interim Agreement has defined the fundamental guarantee for the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia and has
provided for the opportunity for all ethnic groups within Kosovo
to enjoy equal rights. The peace talks on Kosovo in Paris failed
last Friday after Yugoslavia refused to sign the Interim Agreement,
which offered substantial autonomy to the ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo and required Western troops to "monitor peace
implementation" in the region. Yugoslavia and other countries say
the agreement violates Yugoslavia's sovereignty. (Romania-

<HEADLINE> Chinese Private Investors Favor Treasury Bonds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Treasury bonds have emerged as
the first investment choice of an increasing number of Chinese
citizens, with brisk sales of bond issues in certain areas.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Finance issued treasury bonds valued at 50
billion yuan on March 10 as part of this year's total planned
issue of 341.5 billion yuan approved by the National People's
Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
The ministry said it will focus on the various demands of
private investors when determining the timing and scale of new
bond issues during 1999.
</P>
<P>
Analysts note that savings accounts, the stock market and bonds
currently account for the three major channels for private
investment in China. However, they point out that risks involving
the stock market and dramatic interest rate cuts over the past few
years have increased the attractiveness of the bond market.
</P>
<P>
The general public's awareness of the value of treasury bonds
has increased significantly since China resumed bond issues in the
early 1980s, with good returns on investments over the past few
years prompting increased sales.
</P>
<P>
A number of investors have used proceeds earned from treasury
bonds issued in 1996 to purchase new bonds.
</P>
<P>
"Bonds offer the best investment choice. Treasury bonds are
more profitable and are less risky," according to one private
investor.
</P>
<P>
Investors have also been attracted by the fact this year's
bonds can be used to obtain mortgages. Ministry officials point
out that the new function was added to support the consumer credit
services offered by commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
Chinese investors are no longer content with depending on
interest earned on bank deposits and are exhibiting greater
activity in diverse investments. Insiders note that central bank
interest rate cuts over the past few years have influenced the
investment choices of private investors.

<HEADLINE> Dalian Children's Eyesight Improves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The latest statistics by the
Educational Committee of the Dalian City, northeastern China's
Liaoning Province, show that among more than 260,000 middle and
primary school students surveyed, only 34.26 percent suffer from
nearsightedness, a little over 12 percent lower than that of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The percentages for the year 1995 and 1992 were 42.17 and 40.97
respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, the percentage for the whole country has been rising
in recent years. Other statistics show that the percentage in 1997
for primary school pupils in the urban areas was 22.78, middle
school students 55.2, and senior high students 70.4, which has
become an increasing worry for parents and teachers.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem, local governments have taken various
measures. Quite a few schools in Dalian have improved the study
environment, providing more suitable desks, chairs, and lighting
conditions, and publicizing the importance of how diet can affect
eyesight.
</P>
<P>
However, the fact that officials have realized that the main
reason for the increase in poor eyesight is the heavy study burden
has accelerated the reform of the educational system in China.
</P>
<P>
Regulations issued in the past few years in Dalian mean that
the class time in some primary schools has been shortened to 35
minutes per session. And homework has been reduced so that first
and second grade pupils will be able to finish the work while
still at school, sparing more time after class for leisure and
entertainment.

The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- On the eve of his arrival in Washington Monday afternoon,
Palestinian National Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat indicated in
Vienna he will ask U.S. President Bill Clinton to support a

Palestinians will have an independent state and it is a matter of
time.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The Histadrut labor federation of Israel is continuing to
prepare for "serious disruptions" in the public sector Wednesday,
because negotiations have not narrowed a gap of more than 10
percent between the union's wage demands and Finance Ministry
proposals. On another front, elementary school teachers stopped
work Sunday morning as a warning strike and the Histadrut
Teachers' Union is threatening to shut down the school system if
progress is not achieved in its negotiations on wages by early
next month.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Party Leader Appeals to Censure Corrupt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Vice Chairman of Uganda's ruling
National Resistance Movement (NRM), Mosese Kigongo, has called on
the parliament to censure corrupt ministers.
</P>
<P>
Monday's New Vision daily quoted Kigongo as saying over the
weekend that censuring ministers is a good move that acts as a
sieve to rid the NRM and government of corrupt individuals.
</P>
<P>
People should not waste time discussing whether the legislature
should or should not censure government officials but leave the
parliament to continue doing so if it can produce convincing
evidence against the censured, he added.
</P>
<P>
Those corrupt individuals within the NRM hierarchy, who tarnish
the image of the government, should face the law for their evils,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is currently gripped by scandals of abuse of office by
some senior government officials. The parliament has censured
two state ministers and is likely to censure another two including
Vice President Specioza Kazibwe.
</P>
<P>
Kazibwe, also the minister of Agriculture, Animal Industry and
Fisheries, is said to be responsible for the missing of 3.4
billion shillings (3.4 milling U.S. dollars) meant for
construction of 15 valley dams in the country.

<HEADLINE> Water Provision Improves Remarkably in UAE </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Despite natural challenges,
the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has made tremendous progress in
water production and provision, the local daily Gulf News said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Many water desalination plants have been established in the
country to enhance self-sufficiency in drinking water, the paper
quoted UAE Minister of Water and Electricity Humaid Nasser
al-Owais as saying on the eve of the World Water Day, which falls
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The country's daily produce of drinking water totals 440
million gallons (about 2 billion liters), making it the second
largest producer of desalinated water in the world," the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
More than 35 dams have been built for the preservation of rain
water in various parts of the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
And 8 million cubic meters of treated sewage water are also
produced for irrigation of parks and streets, he added.
</P>
<P>
Despite the progress, the minister kept sober-minded, saying
the UAE still need to spend about 13 billion dirhams (about 3.55
billion U.S. dollars) on the improvement of water resources in the
next 20 years.
</P>
<P>
"According to available data, the Gulf region and other parts
of the Middle East are on the verge of water crisis," he said.

<HEADLINE> Looming Risks of Financial Crisis Closely Watched (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- China is closely watching the
risks that still loom following the Asian financial crisis,
despite a stable yuan.
</P>
<P>
In a speech made earlier this year, President Jiang Zemin
observed that though occurring in foreign countries, the financial
crisis has taught China a lively and profound lesson.
</P>
<P>
"We should make in-depth studies on the reasons for the
financial crisis, and draw lessons from it," he urged.
</P>
<P>
Wang Mengkui, director of the Development Research Center of
the State Council, believes that China can draw at least four
conclusions from the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
First, maintaining a healthy development of the national
economy lays a foundation for the maintenance of financial and
economic safety.
</P>
<P>
Second, China should unswervingly carry out the economic
reforms aimed at establishing a socialist market economic system.
</P>
<P>
Third, the modernization of China must be actively maintained
in the process of economic globalization.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, the method of modernization must be in compliance with
the country's actual conditions.
</P>
<P>
A recent in-depth study by Wang Mengkui and his team concluded
that the role of a comparatively closed capital market is limited
in its ability to guard against the risks to the national economy
from the integration of global finance and the new high-tech
methods employed in financial transactions.
</P>
<P>
Many experts have warned that the shrinking wealth and global
overproduction are potential crises that China may have to face.
</P>
<P>
China's financial conditions have been sound, despite the fact
that since the latter half of last year, the Asian financial
crisis has spread to countries including Russia and Brazil,
causing worldwide turmoil.

<HEADLINE> Looming Risks of Financial Crisis Closely Watched (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The experts, however, think that China has already begun
experiencing overproduction, a fundamental reason for the
financial crisis worldwide. The global overproduction environment
is another risk confronting China.
</P>
<P>
Chen Huai, a research fellow with the Center, writes in a
special report that the crises of debt payment, a falling stock
market, and the credibility of the fiscal and financial systems
are only symptoms, while the real crisis lies in the worldwide
devaluation of wealth and assets.
</P>
<P>
"The deepening crisis China would face is one related to
devalued wealth and assets," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the Chinese government has already noticed such
risks. This year, China has created a series of measures aimed at
maintaining the stability of the yuan, steadily promoting capital
liberalization in compliance with its own conditions, and
rectifying malpractice in its financial operations.
</P>
<P>
Measures taken to combat the financial crisis include
increasing the issue of treasury bonds to spur infrastructure
construction and support the operation of state-owned banks, and
new financial reform schemes designed to prop up the reform of
state-owned enterprises, enhance the reconstruction of flood-hit
areas and encourage exports.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has also worked out a positive fiscal
policy to stimulate domestic demand and keep economic growth this
year at seven percent.
</P>
<P>
Many economists favor these policies, while at the same time
they stress the importance of protecting the domestic market,
warning against the possibility of international overproduction
taking advantage of increased domestic demand in China.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Conference Against Corruption Opens in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 22 (Xinhua) -- A three-day international
conference on fighting corruption into the 21st century opened at
the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition Center here Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Some 700 local, inland and overseas delegates from 383 agencies
in 52 jurisdictions attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The conference hosted by the Hong Kong Independent Commission
Against Corruption (ICAC) is designed to explore anti-corruption
strategies to meet the challenges in law enforcement and
administration in the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
It is also expected to strengthen cooperation among different
jurisdictions in fighting corruption.
</P>
<P>
Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region, said that in the last quarter of a century,
the ICAC has substantially reduced corruption in Hong Kong and
kept it under control.
</P>
<P>
Its investigative ability has turned corruption into a high-
risk crime, its education effort has ensured that Hong Kong
community cannot regard it as a way of life.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong now prides itself as one of the best places to do
business, with a clean and efficient civil service, accountable
and transparent procedures, and fair and open commercial practices,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"In spite of our success in the past," he said, "corruption in
its various forms will continue to test our resolve."
</P>
<P>
With the ease of travel, the increasing liberalization and
globalization of financial markets and rapid technological
development, there is even greater need for the world community to
join hands in keeping this heinous crime at bay, he said.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a keynote speech at the opening ceremony, Andrew Li
Kwok-nang, chief justice of the HK Court of Final Appeal,
explained that corruption commonly involves the dishonest or
preferential use of power or position which has the result of one
person or organization being advantaged over another.
</P>
<P>
Corruption motivated by human greed distorts values and
standards and creates injustice, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li reviewed the unswerving work that the ICAC has done in the
past 25 years and briefed the participants on Hong Kong's
experience in combating corruption and challenges that it is
confronted with.
</P>
<P>
He said the mission of fighting corruption will never cease.
There must always be concerted efforts to combat corruption which
may come in new forms and in circumstances which are harder to
detect.
</P>
<P>
"Sound legislative framework, innovative investigatory skills
and continuing public education programs are essential," he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
During the conference, the delegates will exchange views on
their perceptions of the world corruption scene and discuss
different approaches and investigation techniques to combat
transnational corruption.
</P>
<P>
Chinese mainland, Australia, Singapore, the Philippines, the
United States and Britain have sizable delegations to the
conference.
</P>
<P>
Other participating jurisdictions include Canada, Chile, Egypt,
France, India, Indonesia, Jordan, Malaysia, Mongolia, Mozambique,
Myanmar, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, South Africa, the
Netherlands and Macao.

<HEADLINE> N. Zealand Plans to Harness Business into "Knowledge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand Government
wants to harness business into a "knowledge economy" model, and
next month sees the start of nationwide series of forums hosted by
Enterprise and Commerce Minister Max Bradford.
</P>
<P>
According to a media release issued Monday by the Minister's
Office, Bradford holds that a knowledge economy should be based on
intellectual capital, or brains, rather than "just having
efficient manufacturing systems".
</P>
<P>
To attain the goal, the New Zealand government has worked out a
 Five-Point Plan, calling for lifting Kiwi skills and intellectual
knowledge. It would better focus the government's effort in
research and development, improve access to risk and investment
capital, ensure regulations and laws, support innovation and
promote success, and build a supportive culture for innovative
new Zealanders.
</P>
<P>
"The future for our children lies in capitalizing on the waves
of change, by making a commitment to education and research, and
attracting and encouraging the innovative people who can put new
ideas to work for New Zealand," the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"We need to create a culture and environment that recognizes
science and research as important too," he added.
</P>
<P>
There will be 23 meetings on the subject across the country,
starting on April 20. Senior cabinet members, business people as
well as officials of the Enterprise and Commerce Ministry, will
attend the meetings.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand's Kakapo Population Reaches Record Level </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Kakapo numbers have topped 60
for the first time in 20 years after the hatching of five chicks
this breeding season, a record for any season, a Wellington-based
newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Evening Post said all five chicks were hatched under
artificial incubation and another six fertile eggs are waiting to
hatch. The two-month breeding season ends later this month.
</P>
<P>
The kakapo, a flightless green native parrot in New Zealand, is
one of the world's most critically endangered birds.
</P>
<P>
New Zealand Conservation Minister Nick Smith was quoted as
describing this year's success as "phenomenal and surprising", as
the endangered species' eggs are always threatened by predators.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper said chicks will be returned to predator-free
islands once they are old enough to look after themselves.

<HEADLINE> Oman to Decide on Seeb Airport Privatization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Oman will soon take a decision
on the privatization of Seeb International Airport.
</P>
<P>
"A committee looking into the privatization proposal has been
holding regular meetings to finalize its recommendations soon,"
Omani Minister of Communications Al Ghazali said, the UAE's Gulf
News daily reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The proposal called for the privatization of all the airport's
departments with the exception of air traffic control and
security, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of the Omani government's campaign to
accelerate privatization, he added.
</P>
<P>
Al Ghazali said the traffic at the airport, under constant
expansion, is growing at the rate of 8 percent every year,
compared with the normal growth rates of 5-7 percent at airports
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
He attributed this upward trend to the growing importance
of Muscat as an international destination.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Iron, Steel Prices to Increase by 50 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The cash-strapped Zimbabwean Iron
and Steel Company will increase the price of iron and steel
products next month by at least 50 percent to offset a similar
hike in price of coal and coke products.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman of the company Jeff Gotora confirmed Sunday that the
increase would be passed on to consumers, the daily Herald
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The decision by the company comes two weeks after the country's
 sole coal producer, Wankie Colliery, hiked the prices of coal and
coke products by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
There are fears that the industries will, in turn, pass on the
increase to consumers adding to the problems they already face.
</P>
<P>
Consumers will now have to brace up for an upward adjustment of
prices of most goods and commodities using steel.

<HEADLINE> China's Insurance Sector Shows Great Potential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- China's insurance market is
expected to boom in the near future as more people plan to invest
in all sorts of insurance, today's Financial News reported.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted by the China Consumers Association (
CCA) shows that 17.67 percent of the respondents said they plan to
buy insurance this year, a percentage much higher than several
years ago.

<P>
The survey also shows that insurance is among the five products
and services most favored by Chinese consumers this year,
following air conditioners, houses, tourism, and television sets.
</P>
<P>
An official with the CCA said that as people's living standards
rise to new levels, their awareness of insurance also rises, and
this will give a strong boost to China's insurance sector.
</P>
<P>
The insurance sector has registered an average annual growth
rate of 37.6 percent since 1979 when China resumed the insurance
industry.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, this sector had employed 150,000 people and
its revenues reached 124.7 billion yuan, up 14 percent from 1997.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Plans to Appoint Ombudsman by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government is
planning to appoint an "ombudsman" and form a "national human
rights commission" by the year 2000, with a view of ensuring rule
of law in the country, the Bangladesh Observer daily newspaper
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Two separate bills regarding the matter will be soon placed in
parliament, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the draft Aid Memorandum for the coming
Bangladesh Development Forum (BDF) to be held in Paris on April
19-20 as saying that the ombudsman will enhance the government's
accountability, transparency and efficiency in conducting the
government business and non-discriminatory application of the
laws, while the national human rights commission will be an
independent watchdog of the human rights issues.
</P>
<P>
As a part of the Policy Agenda for the fiscal year 1999-2000,
the government is planning to establish the ombudsman office and
the human rights commission.
</P>
<P>
As previous years, the Finance Ministry has prepared the Aid
Memorandum for the BDF, at which the donor countries and agencies
will finalize the aid for Bangladesh for 1999-2000 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry highlighted the policy agenda in aid
memorandum to obtain more aid from the donors by ensuring them of
financial and administrative reforms advocated by the donor
countries and agencies.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the policy agenda for next year has laid
emphasis on the appointment of ombudsman and the formation of
human rights commission for ensuring rule of law.
</P>
<P>
Besides the ombudsman and the commission, the policy agenda has
also addressed the fiscal and foreign exchange rate policy,
privatization process and improvement of local government's body
to help achieve macro-economic stability.
</P>
<P>
Projecting a target of 6.4 percent growth in GDP (gross
domestic product) for the 1999-2000 fiscal year, the aid
memorandum said that this would be achieved by implementing the
policy agenda.

<HEADLINE> Experts Call for Curbing Waste in Mining </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Experts in the field of mining
have called for urgent measures to curb waste in exploration and
mining, as well as measures to promote recycling, according to a
recent edition of China Building Material News.
</P>
<P>
China is currently facing the rapid depletion of mineral
resources, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Some 168 minerals thus far discovered in China currently
fulfill demand for the nation's industrial development.
</P>
<P>
However, 16 of the 45 strategic minerals required to ensure
smooth national economic development will be subject to depletion
prior to the year 2000. The total number of adequate resources is
expected to drop to 23 minerals by 2010 and fall even further to
six in 2020, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Xun, chairman of the China Mineral Association, joined
other experts in calling for measures to deal with this situation.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that 23 of China's major oil fields, including Daqing
Oil Field, have entered the latter stages of oil exploration, with
13 fields expected to totally deplete reserves within 10 years.
</P>
<P>
He noted that 407 coal mines with a total annual output of 63
million tons will deplete reserves by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper reported that China's resource recycling rate is
10-20 percent lower than in most developed countries, with the
small mines incurring great losses in terms of wasted resources.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Bureau of Internal Revenue of
the Philippines said Monday that it will do its best to collect
the 575 million U.S. dollars in tax deficiencies it imposed on the
Marcos family's real estate properties.
</P>
<P>
The bureau's Litigation and Prosecution Chief Attorney Osias
Baldovino said that the Marcos tax payments was expected to be
collected within this year which could be a big boost to the
government's economic coffer.
</P>
<P>
At this stage, the bureau is just waiting for the issuance of
the writ of garnishment from the Supreme Court before the
collection of the tax deficiencies, he said.
</P>
<P>
Baldovino, who is tasked to go after people and corporations
that continue to ignore their tax obligations to the government,
is optimistic that the court will no longer delay the issuance of
the writ of garnishment.
</P>
<P>
In case that the writ of garnishment is already issued but no
amount of tax payments could be extracted from the Marcos family,
the government will have no other option but to confiscate the
properties, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Imee Marcos, one of the late president Marcos'
heirs, has recently insisted that the government should first
establish the ownership of these questionable properties before
finally deciding to carry out collection of the tax deficiencies.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Scales Down Export Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi Commerce Ministry
has scaled down the current July 1998-June 1999 fiscal year's
export target by 170 million U.S. dollars to 5.63 billion dollars,
an English daily newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The fresh target was set recently as the ministry realized that
it was "difficult" to achieve the previously#-set target of 5.8
billion dollars, as exports suffered a major setback during
August-September last year due to severe floods, a Commerce
Ministry source was quoted by the Daily Star as saying.
</P>
<P>
In the previous fiscal year, the country's exports stood at
5.16 billion dollars, about 2.81 percent higher than the set
target of 5.02 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In August last year, the Commerce Ministry announced the 5.8
billion dollar export target, which was propped up in view of a
strong export growth in the previous fiscal year. But the
prolonged floods upset the ministry's calculations forcing it to
lower the figure.
</P>
<P>
The country fetched 2.56 billion dollars from exports in the
first six months of the current fiscal year, 11.7 percent short of
the target and 1.5 percent lower than the corresponding period of
the previous fiscal year, the source said.
</P>
<P>
Except for tea, export targets of the major earning sectors
such as ready-made garments(RMG), knitwear, frozen food, leather,
raw jute and jute goods, agricultural products, petroleum
by-products, chemical products, engineering products, electronics
and handicrafts, could not be achieved from July to December of
the current fiscal year, he stated.
</P>
<P>
Exports by the RMG sector earned 1.49 billion dollars during
the first six months, 4.94 percent less than the target (1.57
billion dollars), while knitwear worth 454 million dollars was
exported against the target of 565 million, 19.6 percent lower
than the target and 9.17 percent higher than the corresponding
period of 1997-98 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Frozen foods worth 154.3 million dollars were exported in the
period, against the target of 160 million dollars, and earnings
from jute goods were 139.5 million dollars against the target of
150 million dollars in the first half of the current fiscal year,
seven percent short of the target.
</P>
<P>
Finished and crust leather exports fetched 75.53 million
dollars, 24.47 percent less than the half year target.
</P>
<P>
Tea worth 25.36 million dollars was exported in the period
against the target of 25 million dollars, 1.44 percent higher than
the target for the current fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Plane Impounded In India on Charge of Spying </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 22 (Xinhua) -- An aircraft from the United
States was impounded and its two-member crew taken into custody on
charge of spying last Wednesday in Ahmedabad, 915 km southwest of
here.
</P>
<P>
News media here reported Monday that the turbo-prop two-seater
aircraft was impounded after it landed for refueling at the Sardar
Patel international airport in the southwest coastal state of
Gujarat on the morning of March 17.
</P>
<P>
Quoting official sources, newspapers published here Monday said
the crew, a pilot and a navigator, intruded into Indian airspace
without valid immigration papers.
</P>
<P>
The plane, which was on a Thailand-Calcutta-Karachi flight, was
reportedly fitted with six cameras on its belly and detained on
charge of espionage.
</P>
<P>
The local Zee Television said that the plane, coming from
outside India and heading towards Karachi, Pakistan, had stopped
at Nagpur, 1,012 km south of here, for refueling and went off the
radar system soon after.
</P>
<P>
After remaining out of contact for three hours, apparently
because of flying at a very low altitude, it sought permission to
land at the Ahmedabad airport, the private television reported.
</P>
<P>
The plane was suspected to have filmed "restricted areas" and
local authorities were waiting for the clearance from the center
for further investigation, security sources said.
</P>
<P>
However, sources from the Indian Defense Ministry said Sunday
night that as per their information, no American plane had been
grounded in Ahmedabad on "spying charges".

<HEADLINE> Finnish Election: SDP Remains Biggest Party in Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Finland's governing Social
Democratic Party remained to be the biggest group in the 200-seat
parliament after Sunday's general election, despite a loss of 5.4
percent of votes from the 1995 election, according to unofficial
results published Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The results showed that SDP won 52 seats, 12 seats less than in
1995, the leading opposition Center Party captured 48 seats,
compared with 44 seats in 1995, and the co-ruling Conservatives
leapt to 46 seats from 39 in 1995, emerging to be the biggest
gainer in this election.
</P>
<P>
Among the 18 parties participating in the election, the Leftist
Alliance won 20 seats, Green Party won 11 seats, Christian League
10 seats, and True Finns and Reform Group one seat each.
</P>
<P>
The setback of the SDP is due to its unpopular policies on
employment and welfare which diminished support from its
traditional backers. This was reflected in the falling voter
turnout of less than 70 percent, the lowest in post-war Finnish
elections.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here predicted that the closeness of the
distribution of the seats among the three largest parties will
make the forming of a government even more difficult and there
will be a hard bargaining among them.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's Transport Minister
Suthep Thueksuban is planning to visit Japan soon to seek more
financial support for Thailand's transportation projects, the
Bangkok Post said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The railway, motorway and airport projects were important
infrastructure projects which the ministry had to complete as soon
as possible, the newspaper quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said at a seminar over the weekend that to become a regional
aviation hub, Thailand has to complete its 140-billion-baht
(3.78-billion-U.S. dollar) new Bangkok airport soon since
neighboring Malaysia, Singapore and Hong Kong had already had
their new major airports.
</P>
<P>
Thailand needed some 70 billion baht (1.89 billion dollars)
more to complete its investment in the new airport.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund had already agreed
to lend 61 billion baht (1.65 billion dollars) to the project.
</P>
<P>
The Airport Authority of Thailand and the Finance Ministry,
shareholders of New Bangkok International Airport Co. which is
implementing the project, would invest eight billion baht (216.2
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
The minister said he will also seek some 20 billion baht (540.5
million dollars) from Japan's Special Yen Loan to fund a parallel
railway project of the State Railway of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the minister said he will negotiate with the
Japanese side to ease the condition of awarding at least 51
percent of every project supported by the Japanese funding to
Japanese contractors.
</P>
<P>
The Transport Ministry has also been allocated 2,275 million
baht (61.5 million dollars) from the so-called Miyazawa Fund,
initiated by Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa last year
to help the crisis-hit Asian countries.

<P>
SHANGHAI, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Results of a nationwide survey
suggest that the peony is favored to win the race as China's
national flower.
</P>
<P>
Sixty-five percent of those surveyed picked the peony for the
national flower because, as one said, "it is native to China, and
its big, colorful blossoms and graceful posture represent the rich
culture and prosperity of China," according to the Social Survey
Institute of China.
</P>
<P>
The plum blossom garnered 30 percent of the votes, and five
percent of those polled chose other flowers including the orchid,
chrysanthemum and lotus.
</P>
<P>
A national office entrusted with choosing the national flower
in 1994 has narrowed the alternatives down to two, a single flower
-- the peony -- or a four-flower set composed of the orchid, lotus,
chrysanthemum and plum blossom, representing the four seasons.
</P>
<P>
"The peony has popular support, but the final winner has not
been decided," said a report in today's Wenhui Daily.

<HEADLINE> Romanian President Urges Yugoslavia to Compromise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Romanian president Emil
Constantinescu, in a statement issued Sunday, urged Yugoslavia to
make concessions on the Kosovo crisis by signing the Interim
Agreement for Peace and Self-Government in Kosovo proposed by the
six-nation Contact Group on former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Emphasizing that peace talks may represent a last opportunity
for a political settlement of the crisis, the president said the
Interim Agreement has defined the fundamental guarantee for the
sovereignty and territorial integrity of Yugoslavia and has
provided for the opportunity for all ethnic groups within Kosovo
to enjoy equal rights.
</P>
<P>
The peace talks on Kosovo in Paris failed last Friday after
Yugoslavia refused to sign the Interim Agreement, which offered
substantial autonomy to the ethnic Albanians in Kosovo and require
Western troops to "monitor peace implementation" in the region.
Yugoslavia and other countries say the agreement violates
Yugoslavia's sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Since the breakup of the talks, the United States and its major
NATO allies have heightened their threats to launch massive
airstrikes against Yugoslav military targets if Belgrade does not
compromise.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, the Romanian president, while expressing
welcome to the signing of the agreement by the delegation of the
Kosovar Albanians, urged Yugoslavia to also sign the agreement at
an early date.
</P>
<P>
Although Constantinescu said Yugoslavia's sovereignty should be
respected and that a political solution to the crisis is essential,
he expressed support for possible U.S.-led military action against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
If the situation goes out of control and endangers security in
the region and the whole of Europe, intervention by "the
international community" will be the only approach to prevent the
escalation of the conflict, he said.
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu said he firmly supports the efforts of the
Contact Group, NATO, the European Union and the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe for a political settlement of
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Once the peace talks totally break up, "NATO's intervention to
end the conflict will be necessary and also legal," the president
said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Like to Spend Nightlife in Bars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Bars have now become the first
place that residents in northeastern China's Jilin Province like
to spend their nightlife.
</P>
<P>
A lot of people in the province enjoy visiting bars, chatting
with friends, drinking red wine or beer and at the same time
enjoying lively music.
</P>
<P>
"I prefer bars with a romantic touch. I can chat the whole
night with my friends and only spend a few dozen yuan. I go there
almost every week," said Miss Li, a college student.
</P>
<P>
Nearly all the bars in the capital city Changchun are doing
well since last winter. It is even hard to find a seat late in the
evening in a number of well-known venues such as Zero Point,
Chariot, and Romantic Night.
</P>
<P>
Residents in Changchun divide the bars into two categories: the
tranquil ones and the exciting ones. You can expect soft music and
exquisite and elegant interior decoration in tranquil bars, while
rock'n'roll, jazz, and pop music are part and parcel of the
exciting ones.
</P>
<P>
Bars usually open at six or seven o'clock in the evening and
close at three o'clock in the morning, providing the young with a
nice place to spend a romantic night with either their lovers or
friends.
</P>
<P>
More and more middle-aged people are also falling in love with
such places. "We can enjoy ourselves and relax after a hard day's
work." said Zhang Haiquan, a 42-year-old company sales manager.
</P>
<P>
The interior decoration of the bars is rather special. Often
there are wooden chairs and tables and soft lights and linen
curtains, which help create a cozy atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
It is very cold in Changchun in the winter and the nights there
are long. Most of the residents used to spend a boring night at
home, but now bars have added bright color to the long and cold
winter evenings.

<HEADLINE> Nutrition Week Launched in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka launched an islandwide
National Nutrition Week Monday to create an awareness among the
public on the need to uplift nutrition levels.
</P>
<P>
During the week, nutrition programs will be conducted by the
Health Ministry in collaboration with the World Bank and United
Nations Children's Fund.
</P>
<P>
The target of the program is the student population which
comprises nearly 25 percent of the total population (18.2
million).
</P>
<P>
In a message to mark the occasion, Sri Lankan President
Chandrika Kumaratunga said that despite Sri Lanka enjoying good
health statistics for the past few decades, there is still a high
incidence of infant and pre-school malnutrition.
</P>
<P>
Recent studies show that more than 25 percent of the children
are in grade 3 protein energy malnutrition in 12 out of the 24
districts in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
She said her government was in the process of implementing a
series of educational reforms. To enable these reforms to have a
successful impact on young children it was necessary for them to
be well fed to enhance concentration.
</P>
<P>
Many children go to school without breakfast and the rigors of
school life also do not permit them to have the required nutritive
meals at the correct time.
</P>
<P>
The government plans soon to introduce a nutritious milk
biscuit program to provide comprehensive nutrition education and
nutrition supplementation to infants, pre-school and primary
school children, the president said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 21 (Xinhua) -- In face of heightened airstrike
threats made by the United States and its NATO allies, Commander
of the Third Army of Yugoslavia, Nebojsa Pavkovic, said Sunday
that the Yugoslav army is now on high alert against any foreign
aggression.
</P>
<P>
Pavkovic inspected Yugoslavia's air defence force, armored
force and the Yugoslav frontier force in Nishon on the border with
Macedonia, local media reports said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. special envoy Richard Holbrooke has been sent
to Yugoslavia to deliver a "final warning" to President Slobodan
Milosevic on looming airstrikes by NATO forces.
</P>
<P>
Also Sunday, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said
that Holbrooke's mission was the last chance for Yugoslavia to
avert a military attack.
</P>
<P>
Since the Paris peace talks broke down on March 19, the United
States and its major NATO allies have heightened their airstrike
threats against Yugoslavia. However, Yugoslavia has shown no
signs of compromise.
</P>
<P>
So far, most of the dependents of Western countries' embassy
staffs in Belgrade and the observers of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in Kosovo have been
withdrawn.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine, Israel to Strengthen Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, March 20 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine and Israel signed Sunday a
memorandum of understanding on security matters and other
documents on military cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The memo was reached after Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma
and Prime Minister Valery Pustovoitenko held talks with visiting
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a joint press conference after the talks, Kuchma
said Ukraine attached importance to expanding cooperation with
Israel and supported its efforts in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two countries share many views on bilateral and
international matters, he said.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed to sign a treaty on avoiding double taxation
and to work out measures to protect Israeli investments in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Kuchma emphasized that Ukraine would continue to guarantee the
rights of its Jewish minority. About 500,000 Jews currently live
in Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said Israeli business people are very much interested
in investing in Ukraine and Israel hopes to expand cooperation
with major Ukrainian industries.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade amounted to 174 million U.S. dollars in 1998,
up 39 percent from 1997. But Israeli investments in Ukraine total
only 12.6 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu arrived here Sunday for a one-day visit, after which
he will also visit Russia for talks with his Russian counterpart
Yevgeny Primakov and other officials.

<HEADLINE> Poplar Trees Found Growing in Qaidam Basin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Wild poplar trees covering an area
of 120 ha have recently been found growing in the Qaidam Basin, in
northwest China's Qinghai Province, the first to be found in the
region reckoned one of the most inhospitable places in China.
</P>
<P>
The trees, some 50 km west of the industrial city of Golmud,
are estimated to be at least 100 years old on average, and the
oldest, believed to be over 1,000 years, is 68 cm. in diameter.
</P>
<P>
According to Yan Chaofeng, deputy chief of Golmud's forestry
station, it takes about 16.3 years for the poplar trees to grow
just one cm. in diameter.
</P>
<P>
The poplar is the only tree that can survive in the desert in
great numbers as it is not hugely affected by the fierce winds,
has a resistance to the saline content of the sand and has the
ability to bind dunes together.
</P>
<P>
They are mainly found in the Xinjiang Uygur and Inner Mongolia
autonomous regions and Gansu Province.
</P>
<P>
Qaidam is one of the country's three inland basins and is very
dry and unable to support many lifeforms.
</P>
<P>
Environmental experts believe that the discovery of the poplar
trees will provide valuable reference for future study on the
geological formation of the basin and its surrounding areas and
give an insight into the changes of local weather conditions.

Pakistan and China have great potential for economic
cooperation in the current process of economic globalization, said
Haque, adding that an increasing number of joint ventures
established in recent years have injected vitality into bilateral
economic ties.
</P>
<P>
He said that the good relationship between Pakistan and China
is a cornerstone of Pakistan's foreign policy, noting that his
country has resolutely supported China's stand on the issues of
Taiwan, Tibet and human rights, and he is confident that China
will enter the World Trade Organization as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Haque spoke highly of the role China has played in maintaining
stability, security and development in the Asian-Pacific region
and the world at large.
</P>
<P>
He particularly referred to the fact that China has managed to
prevent the devaluation of the RMB yuan amid the Asian financial
crisis, and said this has helped the affected countries to restore
their confidence and end the crisis at an early date.
</P>
<P>
Haque said, "Pakistan and China already maintain sound ties,
and should further promote the existing friendship."
</P>
<P>

leaders of the two countries, especially among scholars, students
and business people.

<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Inam ul Haque, Pakistan's
ambassador to China, said recently that the frequent exchanges of
visits between leaders of Pakistan and China have strengthened
bilateral cooperation in all fields, and will help bring about a
comprehensive partnership between the two countries oriented
toward the 21st century.

In an interview with Xinhua, he recalled that Chinese President
Jiang Zemin visited Pakistan in 1996, and Pakistani President
Farooq Leghari paid a reciprocal visit to China the following year,
and reviewed the China visit by Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif in 1998 and the visit to Pakistan by Chinese Defense
Minister Chi Haotian earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
He particularly extended a welcome to Li Peng, chairman of the
Standing Committee of China's National People's Congress, on the
occasion of his upcoming visit to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Haque said that Pakistan-China relations have developed further
in the past two years since he became ambassador, and attributed
this to the consistent observation by both countries of the UN
Charter, five principles of peaceful co-existence, and the norms
of the international laws.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan-China friendship is time-tested and an example of good
relations between two countries with different social systems, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin's visit to Pakistan in 1996 laid
a foundation, he said, and since the two countries have conducted
fruitful cooperation in political, economic and cultural fields.
</P>
<P>
On Pakistan-China economic and trade ties, Haque said that the
annual trade volume between the two countries stands at around one
billion U.S. dollars and has continued to increase.

<HEADLINE> Arid Land Has Potential for Agricultural Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Abundant natural resources and
water-saving agricultural technology will transform the arid
farmland in north China providing it with great potential for
agricultural production, according to Lu Ming, vice-minister of
Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
Lu said that the agricultural output will remain at about 500
million tons by the end of this century, and reach 800 million in
the next 30 years, in which the arid farmland will play a crucial
role.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that arid land yields up the whole country's 46
percent of crops, 61 percent of cotton, 72 percent of soybeans,
and 46 percent of oil products. The per capita farmland and the
forests in the 16 northern provinces and regions are 1.34 and 1.15
times respectively that of the country's average.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels have attached great importance to the
improvement of the ecological conditions and the exploitation of
natural resources.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics show that over 20 key provinces of the
whole country with arid land have increased another 2.66 million
hectares of farmland by reforming slopes, and the crop production
capacity by 2 billion kilograms in the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Over 85 percent of the yet-to-be-cultivated land of the whole
country lies in northern China, and the long period of sunshine
and temperature difference between the day and the night there are
beneficial for the growth of crops.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Makes Efforts to Fight Tuberculosis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government is making
efforts to fight tuberculosis (TB), English daily Vietnam News
reported here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Professor Nguyen Viet Co, director of Vietnam's Central
Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases, told a press briefing
here last week in the lead up to World Tuberculosis Day this
Wednesday that the Vietnamese government would provide sufficient
medicine to treat TB patients and Vietnam's National Anti-TB
Program had been allocated 22 billion Vietnamese dong (nearly 2
million U.S. dollars) this year to buy medicine.
</P>
<P>
Professor Co was quoted by Vietnam News as saying that the
Dutch government was likely to grant 1 million U.S. dollars this
year to help Vietnam fight against the disease.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam's program aims to cure 85 percent of detected TB
patients every year and build a network of medical stations
providing disease prevention and treatment services in all
communes and cities.
</P>
<P>
The prevention scheme aims to detect 70 percent of those who
contract TB.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 130,000 cases of TB are detected every
year in Vietnam but another 200,000 sufferers are not identified.
About 20,000 TB sufferers die every year, said Co.
</P>
<P>
He added that the death rate of TB patients is rising with the
spread of HIV/AIDS. Statistics from Ho Chi Minh City show that
more than half of those dying of TB had contracted HIV at least
two years before.

<HEADLINE> Car Sales in Shanghai Brisk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Car sales in Shanghai, which
boasts two major Sino-foreign manufacturing companies, have
recovered in the first two months of this year, with 36,660
Santana cars being sold, up 21.6 percent from the same 1998 period.
</P>
<P>
And 3,443 customers have ordered a new Buick which the Shanghai
General Motor Co., a Sino-U.S. joint venture, began making last
year.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Boshun, an official in charge of the marketing department
of the Shanghai Auto Sales Corporation, attributed the brisk car
business to the favorable macro-economic and financial loan
policies introduced by the State in recent months.
</P>
<P>
He added that a general crackdown on car smuggling and the
introduction of loan facilities by the country's four biggest
commercial banks, making housing and car sales the new growth
areas in the economy, have also helped promote car sales.
</P>
<P>
Since 1997, the Corporation has opened 19 car sales centers in
the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Yunnan, Hainan and 16 other
provinces in a bid to expand the market.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the Spring Festival, China's traditional holiday
which fell on February 16, the daily sales of Santanas, which are
produced by a Sino-German joint venture, the Volkswagen Co. Ltd.,
exceeded over 1,000.
</P>
<P>
The Corporation expects to sell a record 250,000 Santana sedans
this year, 15,000 more than 1998. And so far 22,600 people have
show an interest in buying Buicks.

MOSCOW -- One person was killed and eight others were wounded
Sunday in an explosion that was believed to be the fourth attempt
to assassinate Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov, Interfax
reported.
</P>
<P>
Maskhadov was unharmed in the blast on an avenue in Central
Grozny, capital of the breakaway Russian republic.
</P>
<P>
The wounded included four of Maskhadov's bodyguards, one of
whom was under intensive care, Interfax reported, quoting
Maskhadov's spokesman, Mairbek Vachagayev.
</P>
<P>
The explosive device, with an equivalent in power of up to 10
kilograms of TNT and believed to be remote-controlled, badly
damaged seven vehicles, including two cars of the presidential
motorcade. (Chechen Bombing-Killing)

<P>
Chechen Deputy Prosecutor General Magomed Magomadov said there
was a link between the bombing and the kidnapping on March 5 of
Russian Interior Ministry envoy Maj. Gen. Gennady Shpigun.
</P>
<P>
"Both crimes are aimed at complete destabilization of the
situation in Chechnya and discredit of authority in the republic,"
Magomadov said.
</P>
<P>
The previous attempt to murder Maskhadov was made last Summer,
when a bomb planted on another Grozny street killed four
presidential bodyguards and mangled the president's armored
vehicle, Interfax said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Factories dealing with
agricultural production have been springing up in north China's
Liaoning Province, helping develop a new industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
The work, in a controllable environment, combines scientific
research, production, processing with sales targets in an attempt
to even out the effects of seasonal problems on grain growth.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the area of "green-house"
grain production in the province has reached 106,000 hectares, one
sixth of the country's total. And these new factories now cover
200 hectares.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Yang Jiashu, an agricultural expert, noted that by
carefully selecting seeds, using specific fertilizers and other
agricultural chemicals, the resultant improved vegetables and
fruit have greater market potential.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the program, output is expected to be two to
nine times more than usual, and profits up by as much as four
times.
</P>
<P>
The fast development of industrialized agriculture will also
accelerate the development of seven related industries including
navigation technology, agricultural chemicals and specific
fertilizers.

<HEADLINE> China's Tertiary Industry to Boost Employment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- More than 10 million jobs are
expected to be created each year by the urban tertiary industry if
China's economy maintains a growth momentum of 7 percent or more,
said Wang Dongjin, vice-minister of Labor and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
"China's urban tertiary industry abounds in temporary jobs. In
the seven large cities including Beijing and Shanghai, over 7
million families, or 70 percent the total, need community services,
which can create 20 million job opportunities," today's China's
Daily quoted Wang as saying.
</P>
<P>
As China faces great pressure with jobless people increasing by
10 million every year, developing the tertiary industry,
especially the service sector, will become the best way to create
jobs.
</P>
<P>
"Every 1 percent growth in the tertiary industry can generate
around 1.3 million new jobs," said Gao Shangquan, president of the
China Reform and Development Institute.
</P>
<P>
The versatile tertiary industry can help relocate almost every
one in need of a job, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
The State will provide preferential policies in terms of
financial support, tax, and business permits to various sectors in
the tertiary industry, especially those requiring less investment,
bringing good returns, accommodating more workers and closely
related to economic development and people's life, Wang said.

YANGON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- A total of 6.3 million U.S.
dollars worth of locally produced gems, jade, pearl and jewelry
were sold through tender system and competitive bidding at the
36th annual Myanmar Gems Emporium which ended here Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
The sum was two times more than that of the 35th event held in
March last year.
</P>
<P>
The six-day state-sponsored emporium, which began last Tuesday,
 attracted over 500 gems merchants from 17 countries and regions,
mostly from China's Hong Kong Special Administrative Region,
Thailand, Japan and Singapore.
</P>
<P>
The emporium also drew 136 gems traders from 69 local
companies.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar, a well-known producer of jade, ruby and sapphire in
the world, has held gems emporiums annually since 1964 with
additional mid-year ones introduced since 1992.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Banks' NPL Ratio Down to 11.01 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine banking system's
ratio of non-performing loans (NPLs) over total loans went down to
11.01 percent in December 1998 from 12.5 percent in October last
year, the Manila Times said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted an official of the Central Bank of the
Philippines as saying that the decline in the NPL ratio can be
attributed to the waning effect of the Asia financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The rise in the NPL ratio up to October last year was due to
the increase in the number of corporations seeking debt relief,
said Diwa Guinigundo, director of the Central Bank's department of
economic research.
</P>
<P>
The number of companies seeking debt relief went up to 35 last
year from 20 in 1997, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the banking system's non-performing assets (NPAs)
declined slightly by 1.09 percent to 7.48 billion U.S. dollars at
the end of last year from a peak of 7.57 billion U.S. dollars in
October 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
The ratio of the NPAs to the banks' total loans dropped to 17.4
percent in December last year from 17.8 percent in October, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The NPAs are bank receivables that are not earning interest.
These include non-performing loans, foreclosed real and other
property, and restructured loans. NPLs are loans not paid for
three straight months.
</P>
<P>
The NPL and NPA ratios are two of the indicators used to
evaluate the quality of a bank's loan portfolio.

ROME, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The humiliation by Sampdoria in
Serie A Sunday was the last straw for Romanian Mircea Lucescu who
resigned as coach of faltering Inter Milan just minutes after the

</P>
<P>
The resignation was immediately accepted by club president

CHANGCHUN, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The border tourism sector in
Jilin Province enjoyed a booming year in 1998, which saw 18,200
domestic tourists visit Russia and the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK).

A local tourism official said that the province has 1,400
kilometers of borders and a large number of travel agencies have
sprung up in Jilin for tourists who want to tour overseas.

Since the opening of the Hunchun Port last year, these agencies
have developed a variety of tourism programs to a number of border
attractions in Russia such as Zarubino and Vladivostok, he said.

By the end of 1998, the agencies assisted 670 Chinese to tour
Russia and welcomed 353 Russian tourists, he said.

<HEADLINE>   Manchester United Stay Top at Premier League </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United stayed at the
top of the Premier League with a 3-1 victory over Everton at Old
Trafford on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
With the win, Manchester United is four points more than the
second placer Arsenal in the rankings.
</P>
<P>
Chelsea maintained their pursuit with a 3-0 win at Aston Villa
earlier in the day, two goals coming from Norwegian Tore Andre Flo
and the third from Dane Bjarne Goldbaek. The Blues moved back into
third place ahead of Leeds United, but were seven points off the
lead.
</P>
<P>
At Old Trafford Manchester United were entitled to look weary
after their 1-1 draw at Inter Milan on Wednesday which enabled
them to reach the European Cup semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Opponents Everton, desperate for points to escape from the
relegation zone, offered little but a tight defense. United had
the sharpness of Norwegian striker Ole Gunnar Solskjaer to thank
for the first goal in the 55th minute.
</P>
<P>
The ball control of Dwight Yorke created the chance for
Solskjaer's 11th premier league goal, and the Trinidad and Tobago
forward was again involved as England defender Gary Neville scored
a rare goal for 2-0 in the 64th minute.
</P>
<P>
United, unbeaten in 19 games, built the platform for England
forward David Beckham to end his goal drought of the past 25
matches with a perfectly placed free kick after 67 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Everton reduced the deficit when Don Hutchison struck a
powerful free kick past Peter Schmeichel in the 80th minute.
</P>
<P>
At Villa Park, Chelsea failed to convert their dominance into
goals until the 59th minute.
</P>
<P>
Flo produced a match-winning performance, opening the scoring,
then set up Goldbaek for 2-0 four minutes from time.
</P>
<P>
Flo also had the last word, giving Chelsea a 3-0 win in injury
time.
</P>
<P>
Villa, premier league leaders early in the season, suffered
their fifth successive home defeat and have earned just one point
from their last eight games.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Arsenal produced another solid performance to
underline their championship defense, beating Coventry 2-0 at
Highbury.
</P>
<P>
Goals by midfielder Ray Parlour and Dutch forward Marc Overmars
in the 16th and 80th minutes kept alive the north Londoners' hopes
of completing a league and F.A. Cup double for the second year in
succession.
</P>
<P>
Manchester United improved their points tally to 63 at the top
from 30 games, Arsenal were on 59 and Chelsea, with a game in hand,
had 56, two ahead of Leeds United in fourth.

HAIKOU, March 22 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese island province of
Hainan received 230,000 domestic and overseas tourists during this
year's spring festival season in mid-February.

province in groups, including 30,000 overseas tourists, while the

A sample survey indicated that 95 percent of the tourists were

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Evander Holyfield and Lennox
Lewis will fight their rematch in September, with each guaranted $
15 million, promoter Don King announced Sunday in New York.
</P>
<P>
King said on a TV program that he had signed contracts from
both heavyweight champions for the rematch of their draw on March
13 for the unified title.
</P>
<P>
"This is the only corrective we have in boxing when we have a
dispute is to have a rematch," King told Fox News. But he didn't
reveal the specific date or site.
</P>
<P>
King said he had received Holyfield's signature for the rematch
Saturday and Lewis' earlier. "They both want to fight in September,
" he added.
</P>
<P>
On March 13 fight, Lewis earned $10 million to Holyfield's $20
million. Lewis is the WBC champion and Holyfield is the WBA and
IBF champion.
</P>
<P>
World boxing's three governing bodies had ordered a rematch
within six months. Lewis was widely believed to have won the bout.
</P>
<P>
American judge Eugenia Williams scored the fight for Holyfield
115-113, South African judge Stan Christodoulou scored it for
Lewis 116-113, while Larry O'Connell of England scored it 115-115.
</P>
<P>
"I have nothing to do with the outcome of an event," said King,
who promoted the first fight. "I have nothing to do with the
appointment of the officials. I feel the draw was justfied because
that's what the judges rendered."

smear test in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
The Age:

<HEADLINE> Rodman Returns to Lakers After Four-Game Absence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- As was expected, Dennis Rodman
had decided to make his return to the Los Angeles Lakers in the
national spotlight.
</P>
<P>
After missing four games for unspecified personal reasons,
Rodman arrived at the Orlando Arena this morning and is playing in
today's nationally televised game against the Magic.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not going to apologize to my teammates. Why would I
apologize," Rodman said in a pregame NBC interview. "The only way
to trust me is to let me play."
</P>
<P>
The flamboyant Rodman helped the Lakers win nine straight games
before being granted a leave of absence. With Rodman gone, the
Lakers lost three of their first four games on a road trip which
continues today in Orlando. Los Angeles conceded at least 100
points in all four games without Rodman.
</P>
<P>
Rodman didn't start but entered the game to a chorus of boos in
the first quarter of the Laker's 115-104 victory today.
</P>
<P>
He told NBC that his absence had nothing to do with drinking,
gambling, smoking or marital problems.
</P>
<P>
Rodman arrived at the Orlando Arena about 90 minutes before the
game and coach Kurt Rambis spoke with him briefly.
</P>
<P>
"I just asked him if he was all right," Rambis said. "He said
he was all right, and that was it."
</P>
<P>
The coach said Rodman had been fined $300 for being away.
</P>
<P>
Wearing sunglasses, a baseball cap turned backward and rings in
both nostrils and an ear, Rodman would not apologize for his
absence.
</P>
<P>
"I can't make everyone happy. I'm sorry? That's not going to do
it. So I'm not going to say that."
</P>
<P>
He said: "I just figure that people have to accept what I do.
If they don't accept it, I don't need to be here or anywhere else.
They can easily say, 'Dennis, we don't need you anymore.' They can
tear up the contract and say good-bye."
</P>
<P>
Rodman left the Lakers on March 13, telling he needed time to
resolve personal issues. In the nine games he played before Sunday,
Rodman averaged 1.9 points and 10.3 rebounds.

<HEADLINE> Spurs Wins League Cup Soccer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- A goal in injury time from Allan
Nielsen gave Tottenham Hotspur the Worthington Cup and George
Graham a trophy in his first season as Spurs manager on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Dane reacted sharply to poach a headed goal and take the
Cup back to North London and book their place in the UEFA Cup next
season.
</P>
<P>
Tottenham earned their victory, having to play the last 30
minutes with just ten men after Justin Edinburgh had been sent off
for violent conduct.
</P>
<P>
But the game will be remembered as one of the dullest in recent
Wembley history, with little in the way of scoring opportunities
or flair.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Review Action on Population, Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan suggested that countries list the mobilization of
resources for population and development high on the global
development agenda, U.N. sources said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came before the U.N. Commission on Population and
Development begins its annual session on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief has sent several reports to the Commission for
consideration on population monitoring, world demographic trends,
the financial aspects of implementing the Cairo Program of Action
and the latest progress in the field, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo International Conference on Population and
Development in 1994 identified a strategy to stabilize world
population growth and achieve sustainable development by
addressing reproductive health needs, rights and responsibilities
of individuals.
</P>
<P>
Reviewing external assistance for population activities, Annan
found that the assistance for 1997 showed the first decrease in
the post-Conference period, with 1.9 billion U.S. dollars, below
the 2 billion dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
A number of developing countries have shown commitment to
implementing the Program of Action by formulating new or revising
national population and development policies in line with
Conference goals.
</P>
<P>
However, financial crises in many developing countries, coupled
with declines in official development assistance from developed
nations have slowed the rate of progress in implementing the
Program of Action, Annan noted.

<HEADLINE> FDA Approves AngioJet To Remove Blood Clots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. federal Food and Drug
Administration has approved a device called AngioJet to be used
to remove blood clots, providing an alternative for those who
could not take clot-busting drugs.
</P>
<P>
Currently doctors use angioplasty to widen the heart arteries
that have been narrowed or blocked. In an angioplasty, a tiny
balloon is threaded into the blocked artery, inflated to widen the
blood vessel, then deflated and removed.
</P>
<P>
Usually the widening remains and blood flow increased. But
sometimes blood clots form in the narrowed areas and these can
lead to heart attack or death. Doctors have to treat such patients
with clot-removing drugs such as urokinase.
</P>
<P>
However some people cannot take the drugs, particularly those
who have a predisposition to bleeding.
</P>
<P>
AngioJet system, made by Possis Medical of Minneapolis, has
the advantage that it can be targeted at a specific area and is
faster than angioplasty. It is a coronary catheter containing a
steel and a plastic tube. It shoots a jet of saline solution
from the metal tube back into the tip of the plastic one,
creating a vacuum that pulls along any blood clots. Treatment
with this medical device takes about one minute, and once the
blood clot is removed, the patient can then undergo angioplasty.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Situation Disturbs EU FM Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Kosovo situation has become a
priority on agenda when foreign ministers of the 15-nation
European Union (EU) started their two-day meeting here on Sunday
to prepare a EU summit at Berlin next week.
</P>
<P>
A German spokesman told reporters after the first-day session,
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fisher had been called back to
Germany because of Kosovo situation.
</P>
<P>
Regularly, the German foreign minister as the current rotating
president of the EU Council of Ministers should preside over the
news conference. The spokesman implied that the first day
closed-door session made no major progress because "a certain and
important country" was still not satisfied with some aspects of
the EU financial reform package.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he can confirm that Austrian foreign minister said the
meeting did not make progess "by single millimeter", the spokesman
said that he could only tell his impression at the meeting,
descreibing some foreign ministerts'' "flexibility" as "a
promising development."
</P>
<P>
Originally, European Commission's future and Agenda 2000, the
EU's financial reform package, were the main focuses at Sunday's
meeting, but Kosovo situation changed the plan as the German EU
president left for home.
</P>
<P>
According to the spokesman, the foreign ministers even did not
touch the aftermath situation on the entire resignation of the
European Commission, the EU executive body which is responsible
for handling routine business, drafting proposals and enforcing
laws.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, British officials distributed a statement
from British foreign office, saying that U.S. special envoy for
Kosovo crisis Richard Holbrooke will come to Brussels on Monday to
discuss Kosovo situation with British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
and French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
They will have "closest consultation" before Holbrooke leaves
for Belgrade to put further pressure on Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic, according to the statement.
</P>
<P>
In a BBC interview on Sunday, Cook also warned Yugoslavia that
the threat of NATO air strikes against the Serbs in Kosovo was
"for real." But he said air strike remain an option they hope to
avoid and he remains in contact with Belgrade for a diplomatic
solution.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that Kosovo situation may have currently
topped the EU agenda, and all other important matters will be left
to Berlin summit since the western allies need to coordinate their
stance on Kosovo crisis, on which the NATO said on Sunday that the
final warning of air strike by the West has shorten from 48 hours
to "a matter of just a few hours."

<HEADLINE> Cholera Under Control in Kenyan Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The outbreak of cholera in the
Kenyan port city of Mombasa, which has claimed 18 lives, is now
under control, a medical officer of Coast Province announced
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Provincial medical officer S.K. Sheriff said the spread of the
epidemic had been put under control in the Indian Ocean coastal
city Mombasa with only two new cases being reported over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
Sheriff said that heightened public awareness had resulted in
the decline in casualties.  However, he warned that the
situation in north and south of the province was still "sensitive"
and medical teams were stepping up their work there.
</P>
<P>
He commended the ongoing drive to demolish kiosks in Mombasa,
saying that the structures were a major contributor to unsanitary
conditions which caused disease outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, medical and council teams are continuing with the
chlorination of the town's water wells.
</P>
<P>
He warned residents against buying food from vendors until the
situation is completely under control. He also advised them to
always boil drinking water.
</P>
<P>
The recent outbreak of the disease hit Mombasa last week and
immediately claimed 10 people. More than 400 people have been
diagnosed as infected.

JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu left
Sunday morning for a three-day visit to Ukraine, Russia and
Georgia in an effort to boost bilateral ties and halt alleged
Russia's weapon technology transfer to Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister's Office issued a statement Saturday night,
denying criticism from opposition parties that the trip is meant
to boost Netanyahu's standing with over 700,000 Russian-speaking
voters in Israel in the May elections.
</P>
<P>
There are important diplomatic matters on the agenda topped
by the issue of long-range missiles and nuclear weapons programs
in Iran, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu will express Israel's concern to Russian Prime
Minister Yevgeny Primakov over the alleged technology transfer to
Iran by Russian companies and research institutions.

BEIRUT -- Six Lebanese have been sentenced to death by a

<P>
The Beirut military court Saturday convicted the six of
contacting with Israel and its proxy South Lebanon Army (SLA),
providing information about activities of Lebanese and Syrian
army in Lebanon to the Jewish state, entering Israel without the
government's permit.
</P>
<P>
The court also sentenced 15 others to varying jail terms with
the similar charges.

BEIRUT -- Israel arrested three members of its allied South

spying for the Shiite Muslim militant group Hezbollah, or Party of
God.

<P>
Among the detained, Adel Younes, a SLA liaison officer with
Israel's Mossad secret service, was held for allegedly passing on
information to the guerrilla group, the Orient radio quoted
security sources as saying.

But it is unclear if the three arrested would be transferred to
Israel or put into the SLA-run Khiam Detention Center inside the
Israeli occupied border zone in south Lebanon.

Hezbollah is spearheading a war of attrition to oust about
1,500 Israeli occupation forces and 2,500 SLA militiamen out of
