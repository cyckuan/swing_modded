<HEADLINE> Beirut Exchange Re-opens after 13-Year Closure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 22 (Xinhua) -- After 13 years of forced closure
due to the 1975-90 civil war, the Beirut stock exchange resumed
trading operations today.
</P>
<P>
The exchange, formally known as the Beirut Bourse, began
operations at 9:00 local time (0700 GMT), but business was
restricted to only three companies.
</P>
<P>
According to observers here, the exchange will be largely
confined to the three companies in its early days, although five
broker firms have obtained the right to engage themselves in
transactions in the exchange.
</P>
<P>
The observers believe that business in the Beirut exchange will
undergo extensive changes such as adopting the system in force in
the Paris exchange, whereby a reference price system will be
changed into a direct price system with regard to circulating
shares.
</P>
<P>
The exchange, the oldest in the Arab world, was established in
1920. Various Lebanese and French companies were tabled in it with
investments in both Lebanon and Syria, both of which were then
under the French mandate.
</P>
<P>
Despite its limited facilities of only eight computers and a
small staff of only 10, the exchange is expected to undertake its
role in promoting economic activities in Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Lotus Launches New PC Program -- Notes Version 4.0 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Lotus Development Corp., a
major software maker in the U.S., today launched Lotus Notes
Release 4, the new version of the world's best-selling messaging
and groupware software.
</P>
<P>
Notes is basically a tool that helps businesses collaborate via
PC networks, offering a way to share and update databases, message
others and run programs made for PC networks.
</P>
<P>
The new version, to be used mainly as a groupware, is touted by
Lotus as important as Microsoft's move from Windows 3.1 to Windows
95 in August.
</P>
<P>
IBM bought Lotus for 3.5 billion U.S. dollars in July, largely
to get Notes, according to a report of the New York Times.
</P>
<P>
The new product would make it easier and faster for users in
organizations of all sizes to find and share all information they
need -- whether it's located in e-mail, databases or host-based
systems or a favorite desktop application, Jeff Papows, Lotus'
executive vice president, said at the Lotusphere '96 here today.
</P>
<P>
With Notes 4.0, people can easily create, publish, retrieve and
manipulate data stored on the Internet's World Wide Web, the
fastest growing, most commercial portion of the global computer
network, according to the developer.
</P>
<P>
Lotus has also begun manufacturing Notes Release 4 servers for
IBM AIX, Sun Solaris on SPARC systems, and HP-UX -- all critical
components to the company's multiplatform Notes strategy.
</P>
<P>
Later this quarter, Lotus will deliver UNIX-based versions of
its InterNotes Web Publisher 2.0, offering UNIX customers the
ability to publish Notes-based information.
</P>
<P>
The combined installed base for Notes and Lotus' other products
has exceeded 13.5 million seats, nearly double its size one year
ago, it is reported here today.

DAR ES SALAAM, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Over 16,000 Rwandan

<HEADLINE> EU, NIS Meet to Launch New TACIS Programming Cycle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The annual TACIS National
Coordinators Meeting opened here today, bringing together some 25
government representatives responsible for the planning and
implementation of the European Union's technical assistance
programme in the New Independent States(NIS) and Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Mr. Hans van den Broek, European
Commissioner responsible for foreign affairs in Europe, said that
the TACIS programme was a "vital element" in the ongoing process of
political and economic dialogue between the European Union(EU) and
the NIS and Mongolia.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Programme had become by far the largest
technical assistance programme in the region, and had committed
over two billion ECU(about 2.6 billion U.S. dollars) in five
years, launching well over 2,000 projects.
</P>
<P>
"I view this event as the offical start of a new programming
cycle," he said, "as we begin to negotiate the Indicative
Programmes which will form the basis for our cooperation over the
next four years."
</P>
<P>
According to the Commissioner, from now on, most projects will
be defined by way of two-year Action Programmes, rather than
annually as before, and a greater emphasis will be placed on
having fewer projects, of larger financial value and longer
duration, in more clearly defined sectors.
</P>
<P>
The National Coordinators meeting lasts from 22-26 January,
beginning with two days of plenary meetings focussing on general
trends in TACIS implementation and performance, and in particular
on aspects of a new programming methodology.
</P>
<P>
There will also be two days of bilateral meetings with the
European Commission's geographical units, covering all aspects of
EU/NIS cooperation.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa's Income Gap Among World's Highest, Says Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 22 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's income gap
was among the highest in the world, said a report released today
by Minister Without Portfolio Jay Naidoo.
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled "Key Indicators of Poverty in South
Africa", said 40 percent of households accounted for less than 10
percent of the country's consumption while the wealthiest 5.8
percent was responsible for 40 percent of consumption.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Pretoria, Naidoo said these
inequalities limited the growth of the domestic market and slowed
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
It also meant the poor could not afford to pay for government
services, said Naidoo.
</P>
<P>
"We all agree that government should provide services, but
affordability is a big issue if we see the levels of inequality
in our country," Naidoo said.
</P>
<P>
The report was compiled by the Southern Africa Labor and
Development Research Unit of the University of Cape Town, with
technical assistance from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
When compared to other middle-income countries like Thailand,
Poland, Chile, Brazil, Malaysia and Venezuela, South Africa had
the highest adult illiteracy and fertility rates, said the
report.
</P>
<P>
The country also had the lowest life expectancy and second
highest infant mortality rates.
</P>
<P>
Naidoo stressed that the report would help set important
guidelines for the government in assigning its priorities for the
future.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Israel Welcomes Results of Palestinian Elections (Part II) (by Huai Chengbo) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Israeli Arab leaders were full of praise for the way the
Palestinian elections were conducted and the high voter
turnout.
</P>
<P>
The Forum of Arab Council heads sent a message of
congratulations to Arafat on the outcome of the ballot.
</P>
<P>
"We are very pleased that the elections were held and passed
peacefully," said the spokesman for the forum, Hussein Suleiman,
who is also head of Mash'had Local Council in the Galilee.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim Sarsur, spokesman for the Islamic Movement in Israel,
was equally enthusiastic about the elections. They were, he said,
the first step "toward an independent Palestinian state alongside
Israel."
</P>
<P>
"We are very pleased that the elections were organized in a way
that is a source of pride, not only for the Palestinians, but all
those throughout the world who believe in democracy and support
freedom," Sarsur said.
</P>
<P>
On the attitude of Hamas toward the elections, Sarsur
said: "Hamas did not participate in the elections for its own
internal reasons and because it does not support the Oslo
accords."
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he added, "Hamas has declared it will not make
problems, and that it sees Palestinian unity as a sacred thing and
will not jeopardize this in any way."
</P>
<P>
Different voices were also heard from the Likud and other
opposition parties. However, they paid less attention to the
elections themselves, but focused their opposition on the
implications of the elections.
</P>
<P>
The Likud Knesset (parliament) faction issued a statement,
calling the Palestinian elections "the laying of the foundations
for a Palestinian state to be created in the areas under the
control of the PLO."
</P>
<P>
Tsomet Party leader Rafael Eitan said the elections for the
Palestinian Authority will not bring about the rescindment of the
clauses of the Palestinian Covenant calling for Israel's
destruction.
</P>
<P>
Only the Palestinian National Council can cancel
these clauses and if the cancellation is carried out by only 88
newly elected local Palestinian Council members, it will have no
validity.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties vented their anger upon the government
for its decision to allow what they called "arch terrorists" to
return to the autonomous areas for a PNC meeting to change its
charter.
</P>
<P>
Likud secretariat chairman Yehoshua Matza said: "The
PLO is deliberately exploiting the weakness of the government."
The Tsomet Party demanded a Knesset debate on the subject.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Israel Welcomes Results of Palestinian Elections (Part I) (by Huai Chengbo) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Israeli leaders can hardly
hide their satisfaction over the results of the Palestinian
elections, which constitute an endorsement of the peace process
between Israel and the PLO as Prime Minister Shimon Peres put it.
</P>
<P>
Peres lost no time to speak to Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO) Chairman Yasser Arafat and congratulated him on
the elections shortly after the completion of the polling on
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israel Television, Peres said the
elections showed most Palestinians back the Oslo agreements.
</P>
<P>
"It's a successful end to parts of the two agreements with the
Palestinians," he said. "The vote wasn't only to elect the
representatives of the Palestinians, but effectively also
confirmed that a decisive majority of the Palestinians backs the
agreements."
</P>
<P>
Arafat was formally elected President of the Palestinian
Council in the first ever Palestinian elections, wining 88.1
percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
The elated Peres told his cabinet Sunday that the elections had
dealt a blow to the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), saying
that the large majority which voted for Arafat was an indication
of the support of the population for the PLO.
</P>
<P>
But Peres has something far-reaching in his mind, namely, the
change of the clause of the Palestinian covenant which calls for
destruction of Israel which should be adopted two months after the
elections.
</P>
<P>
A decision to allow the return of all members of the Palestine
National Council (PNC) -- nearly 500 -- was taken by the
Ministerial Committee on Security.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot expect them to change the covenant without giving
those who have to make the decision the chance to come and to
express their opinions." Peres explained to reporters.
</P>
<P>
He went further to praise the elections, saying "the
demonstration of democracy among the Palestinians is the best bet
for the future."
</P>
<P>
Israeli Environment Minister Yossi Sarid sent a telegram to
Arafat to express congratulations on him and all supporters of
the peace process in the Middle East. He stated that a new
reality is emerging after the elections.

<P>
BEIRUT, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Lebanese government is
studying a project for expanding the Beirut harbor to redouble its
ability to admit containers.
</P>
<P>
The project will cost some 400 million U.S. dollars, and will
enable the harbor to admit 480,000 containers a year, four times
as many as the current level, sources from the Beirut harbor said.
</P>
<P>
The Beirut harbor suffered serious damage during the country's
15-year civil war (1975-1990)
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, the first stage of the project for
modernizing and expanding the Beirut harbor -- which will cost
about 130 million U.S. dollars -- is currently being executed.
</P>
<P>
A total of 13 European and Asian companies -- including French,
Italian and South Korean ones -- have made offers to carry out the
first stage of the project.
</P>
<P>
The European Investment Bank has given Lebanon a loan of 54
million U.S. dollars to be used for implementing the first stage
of the project, provides that the Beirut Harbor Authority
undertakes to secure the remaining cost of the project.
</P>
<P>
Nine foreign firms have also offered to execute another
independent project for setting up a new power station with a
capacity ranging from 10 to 12 megawatts.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Encourage Investment in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 22 (Xinhua) -- One of Russian government's
priorities in 1996 is to encourage investment, Prime Minister
Viktor Chernomyrdin said at a Consultative Council meeting on
foreign investment held here today.
</P>
<P>
He said his government planned to increase investment by up to
four percent in 1996. Russia's investment in 1995 reached about
one-third of the 1991 level.
</P>
<P>
"The investment climate is changing for the better, which is
proved by last year's 13 percent increase in housing
construction," the premier added.
</P>
<P>
As for foreign investment, he said, "we expect foreign
investment to increase by five percent in 1996."
</P>
<P>
Russia's foreign investment amounted to some 2 billion
U.S. dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin assured foreign investors that his government will
continue its tough financial policy this year, although he
admitted that it would be difficult in the year of presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the dismissal of First Deputy Prime Minister
Anatoly Chubais, the Russian premier said, "the removal of Chubais
has no political background and will not entail any change in the
Cabinet's economic policy."
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless," he said, "some corrections will be made in the
privatization process."
</P>
<P>
Chubais, dismissed by President Boris Yeltsin last Tuesday, was
criticized for his work in the nationwide privatization drive.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Tightens Security Along Eastern Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government is
tightening security along the eastern border with Mozambique and
has called on the people in the area to be vigilant against any
forces bent on distabilising the country.
</P>
<P>
Home Affairs Minister of Zimbabwe Dumiso Dabengwa made the
remarks today.
</P>
<P>
''We should exercise maximum vigilance not only because of the
existence of Chimwenje (robbers), but also because we have a lot
of firearms lying around in Mozambique which could be smuggled
into Zimbabwe and used to commit atrocities,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Zimbabwean government was working closely
with that of Mozambique in ensuring that security problems along
the border were solved.
</P>
<P>
He said that the recent armed robberies in Chipinge and armed
clashes between Mozambican security forces and a group of armed
dissidents required Zimbabweans to exercise maximum vigilance.
</P>
<P>
A group of armed robbers, believed to be loyal to Zimbabwean
opposition leader the Reverend Ndabaningi Sithole, struck New
Jersey Supermarket in Chipinge on January 13, the Zimbabwean
National News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The following day, a Mozambican policeman and eight
Zimbabweans were killed during the clash with the armed robbers.
</P>
<P>
Dabengwa said that it was common knowledge that a group of
Zimbabwean dissidents were living in some remore parts of
Mozambique and the latest incidents proved their existence.
</P>
<P>
The method of operation employed by the robbers in Chipinge,
kidnapping people to carry their loot across the border, gave
rise to the suspicion among Zimbabweans that the group may have
been trained by the former Mozambican rebel group, the Mozambique
National Resistance. enditem

<HEADLINE> Zambian Minister On Privatization Of Mining Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Zambian Mines Minister Keli
Walubita reiterated today the privatization of the country's
mining sector should take into account the interest of the mining
industry and the whole nation as well.
</P>
<P>
Walubita said in a statement that the privatization of the
Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) is based on the fact that
massive capital investment is required for Zambia to regain its
prominent position within the global copper mining industry.
</P>
<P>
Only the private sector management of the ZCCM can ensure that
Zambia attains this position, he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that because of the ZCCM's fundamental role in the
national economy, its privatization is being carried out
systematically to safeguard the interest of the mining industry
and the nation.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is taking measures to improve
the profitability of the mining conglomerate before it is
privatized.
</P>
<P>
In negotiations with Anglo-American Corporation in London last
week, the Zambian government indicated that no single corporation
is allowed to buy the whole ZCCM in order to prevent the monopoly
of the mining sector by one private company.
</P>
<P>
The government has 73 percent of shares in the mining
conglomerate whose exports account for 90 percent of the
country's foreign exchange earnings.

FREETOWN, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen of the newly
appointed secretaries of state and one undersecretary today took
their oath of office before Head of State Brigadier Julius Maada
Bio.
</P>
<P>
They include Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Melvin

</P>
<P>
Brigadier Bio ousted former Head of State Captain Valentine

</P>
<P>
He reshuffled the cabinet last Friday, sacking nearly all of
those appointed by Strasser. Bragadier Bio himself was sworn in
as the new head of state on January 17.
</P>
<P>
Among those absent from today's ceremony are Attorney General
Claude Campbell, the only one civilian minister retained from the
Strasser government, and Secretary of State for Finance Samura
Kamara.
</P>
<P>
In a short address, Brigadier Bio urged the ministers to "work
vigorously for peace" in Sierra Leone. "I am for peace and
democracy and will not relent in my effort until this is
achieved," he said.
</P>
<P>
The swearing-in ceremony came within an hour of the return of
Brigadier Bio from Abuja, Nigeria, where he had held consultative
talks with Nigerian leader General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Leonean leader on Saturday visited Guinea to brief
Lansana Conte on events in Sierra Leone and to thank him for

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Likely to Run for Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said today that he will probably run for another term of office in
the upcoming presidential elections scheduled for June.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting with a number of foreign investors in the
Kremlin, Yeltsin said he will not announce his final decision
until February 13 and 15.
</P>
<P>
"I understand that if I agree to participate in the elections,
the struggle will be rather tough," Itar-Tass quoted Yeltsin as
saying.
</P>
<P>
It also reported that Russia's Democratic Choice party headed
by Yegor Gaidar, former strong supporter of Yeltsin, intends to
call on the president not to take part in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
Gaidar told reporters today that Yeltsin's decision to run for
the presidency "may reduce the chances of democratic forces."
</P>
<P>
In the light of the latest events in the Daghestani village of
Pervomaiskoye and administration reshuffles, such as the dismissal
of Anatoly Chubais and Sergei Filatov, Gaidar said he doubted
whether his party would support Yeltsin next June.
</P>
<P>
Chubais, former first deputy prime minister, and Filatov,
previously chief of the presidential administration, are both key
members of Gaidar's party.
</P>
<P>
They were removed from their posts by Yeltsin in the past 10
days, a move seen here as one of Yeltsin's preparations for
bidding for the presidency.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official Calls for Release of Prisoners Who Killed Jews </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Senior PLO official Faisal
Husseini today called on Israel to release Palestinian prisoners
who have killed or wounded Israelis.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking on Israel Radio following his meeting with
foreign ministers of Italy, Ireland and Spain at the Orient House
in east Jerusalem. The meeting discussed the aftermath of the
Palestinian elections held Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Husseini said that the peace process is more important than
revenge.
</P>
<P>
"The Israelis up till now are saying that they will not
release any Palestinian who has Israeli blood on his hands, so
what about Israelis who have Palestinian blood on their hands?"
he asked.
</P>
<P>
"If we think in this mentality, it seems that we will go on
with a war searching and revenging everyone who hurt the other
side," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that this matter must be ended and we must open a
new page (of peace)," he said, demanding the release of all
Palestinian prisoners who have killed or injured Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Husseini added that the Palestinian institutions in east
Jerusalem must continue their existence and the Israeli "closure
and isolation" of east Jerusalem from other parts of the
Palestinian territories must be ended.
</P>
<P>
He praised the Palestinian election process which he described
as "democratic," but criticized the Israeli police and troops for
the low turnout of voters in east Jerusalem and Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Husseini did not run for the Palestinian Council election
because he wanted to devote himself completely to his work in the
Orient House, known as the PLO headquarters in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Israeli Justice Minister David
Liba'i said today that if Israel decides to release Palestinian
prisoners who have Israeli blood on their hands, it is possible
that Jewish prisoners who killed Palestinians for nationalist
motives may be set free as well.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking to reporters at the Erez checkpoint after
meeting with his Palestinian counterpart Freih Abu Medein.
</P>
<P>
Liba'i said that the release of Palestinian prisoners who
killed Jews could be discussed if the Palestinian Authority
proves capable of ending "terrorism."

<HEADLINE> Most S. African Children Live In Poverty, Says Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 22 (Xinhua)-- About 61 percent of South
African children are now living in poverty, said a report
released by Minister without Portfolio Jay Naidoo today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters in Pretoria, Naidoo said: "Poverty among
children has a huge impact on a whole range of important factors
that will have an influence on the future of this country."
</P>
<P>
Naidoo said children under 16 made up about 38 percent of the
population, 45 percent of the country's poor were children, and
more than 70 percent of black children were poverty-stricken.
</P>
<P>
The report, co-ordinated by the University of Cape Town's
Southern Africa Labour and Development Research Unit, found that
38 percent of children in very poor families had stunted in
growth.
</P>
<P>
"They do not even have a chance of making it into the system,"
said the minister, adding this was a terrible reflection of what
the priorities of the society had been in the past.
</P>
<P>
What was needed to rectify the situation were targeted
government programs focusing on school, feeding and primary
health care, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Naidoo also said a steering committee under Health Minister
Nkosazana Zuma would soon release a national action program for
those children living in poverty. enditem

<P>
MOSCOW, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today dispelled rumors that his Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin
may be replaced following the dismissal of First Deputy Prime
Minister Anatoly Chubais.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin told a number of Western investors in the Kremlin that
there were no contradictions between him and Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
"A certain person can be replaced," he said, referring to
Chubais. "But this does not mean a change in the government. It
will work under the chairmanship of Viktor Chernomyrdin," he added.
</P>
<P>
Chubais, 41, who was in charge of economic affairs,
particularly the privatization, in the cabinet since the beginning
of 1994, was removed from his post by Yeltsin last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin called on the people to guard against exaggerating the
possible consequences of Chubais' dismissal.
</P>
<P>
"Do not make a tragedy from the fact that Chubais was
dismissed. It was not Chubais alone who ran privatization," the
president said.
</P>
<P>
He said Chubais would be offered a job abroad, adding that
Chubais "will work for the benefit of Russia" in a European or
world economic institution.

<HEADLINE> Nationwide Strike Launched In Swaziland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 22 (Xinhua)-- A national strike called
by the Swaziland Federation of Trade Unions (SFTU) was under way
this morning in the suburbs of the capital Mbabane and commercil
centre Manzini, while policemen and troops sealed all roads leading
to the two cities.
</P>
<P>
The protesters, including hawkers and members of the SFTU and
teaching and student bodies, took to the streets, demanding the
unbanning of political parties and the institution of democracy,
the South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
No violence had been reported and there were no arrests by 11
am, said police sources in the two cities.
</P>
<P>
However, a spokesman for the Swaziland Chamber of Commerce in
Mbabane said most factories and shops in the city were closed.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in Swaziland heavily armed troops patrolled roads in
armoured vehicles. There was also a strong police presence in
public places.
</P>
<P>
The SFTU earlier said only the lifting of the 22-year-old ban
on political parties could avert the strike.
</P>
<P>
Swaziland Prime Minister Prince Mbilini Dlamini addressed the
kingdom on State Radio, appealing to the labour federation to
meet the government for a fresh round of negotiations. The
federation earlier had snubbed three meetings of the tripartite
committee comprising the government, employees and trade unions
last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Swaziland's high court convened in Mbabane this
morning to decide whether the strike was illegal.
</P>
<P>
The government had filed a high court motion on Friday to have
the strike declared unlawful, but it was refused by Justice Ben
Dunn, who ruled it too vague.
</P>
<P>
The government lodged the application again on Monday, but no
ruling had been made by 1 pm.
</P>
<P>
A SFTU spokesman also confirmed that all SFTU Executive
Committee members were at court, awaiting the outcome of the
case. enditem

<HEADLINE> Hashimoto Vows to Create New Japan Looking to 21st Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto
pledged today to carry out drastic reforms to create a new Japan
as it is entering the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, who took office on January 11 after the resignation
of his predecessor, Murayama Tomiichi, made the promise in his
first policy speech at the outset of the 150-day regular Diet
(parliament) session.
</P>
<P>
"Reform is Japan's most pressing need today," he said.
</P>
<P>
He listed as his cabinet's four top priorities the restoration
of a strong Japanese economy, the construction of a society where
people live long, implementation of an independent diplomacy for
the creation of peace and prosperity, and the promotion of
administrative and financial reforms needed to achieve these goals.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto proposed a three-stage blueprint to achieve a
full-fledged economic recovery in a year from now, to introduce a
thorough economic restructuring in three years, and to lay the
foundations of a creative economy in five years.
</P>
<P>
He vowed to resolve the problem of bad loans held by "jusen"
mortgage firms, saying its early solution "is an indispensable
prerequisite for rebuilding and restructuring the Japanese
economy."
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government has mapped out a controversial scheme
to use 685 billion yen (6.85 billion U.S. dollars) under the
fiscal 1996 budget to liquidate seven failed housing loan
companies, in a bid to rebuild both domestic and overseas
confidence in Japan's financial system.
</P>
<P>
Turning to foreign policy, Hashimoto said Japan should act "on
its own initiative" for world stability and development as well as
for Japan's safety and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Japan, as an Asian-Pacific country, will promote relations with
its partners in the region and take an active part in regional
security dialogues, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo will continue to support China's policies of reform and
opening to the outside world in order to maintain a stable
bilateral relationship with China, he added.
</P>
<P>
On Japan's relations with the United States, Hashimoto said he
will further strengthen "a broad range of cooperation" between
Tokyo and Washington when U.S. President Bill Clinton visits Japan
in April.
</P>
<P>
He also promised to make "sincere efforts" for the future fate
of U.S. military bases in the southernmost Japanese prefecture of
Okinawa, where there was a strong anti-U.S. sentiment since the
rape of a local schoolgirl by three U.S. servicemen in September.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Greece's new Prime Minister
Costas Simitis and his streamlined 40-member cabinet were sworn
in today before the country's President Kostis Stephanopoulos.
</P>
<P>
The composition of the new government was announced last night,
bringing in 10 new faces. It has 11 fewer members than the last
government under former Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou.
</P>
<P>
This is the first socialist government to be headed by someone
other than party founder and President Papandreou, who has been
in hospital for more than two months.
</P>
<P>
During the first cabinet meeting immediately after the
swearing-in ceremony, Simitis called on the cabinet for hard work
to prepare Greece for the 21st century and described his
government as one of work, sesitivity, meritocracy, ethos, daring
and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The new course will be one of unity, renewal and victory, in
order to complete PASOK's (Panhellnic Socialist Movement) four-
year term and emerge victorious in the next general elections
in 1997, Simitis declared.
</P>
<P>
He said the cabinet would meet again next Monday to examine
the policy statement it would table in parliament for the required
vote of confidence.

<HEADLINE> Parliament Conflicts with Government in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Some 150 members of the Iranian
parliament today issued a statement, criticizing senior officials
of the administration of President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
The parliament members in their letter attacked certain
government officials who had brought the Parliament under fire
for lack of coordination with the government.
</P>
<P>
"Under the disguise of declaring their support for the
guidance given by Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei and support for
Hashemi Rafsanjani, they have greatly slandered the Fourth
Majlis," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
The letter, read out at the open session of the Majlis
(Parliament), described the statement as an insult and demanded
that those writing the statement apologize to the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
The MPs warned the top officials that they would be held
accountable for their statements.
</P>
<P>
The letter said, "While cooperating with the government,
appreciating its valuable work and respecting its head,
Parliament preserves its supervisory role efficiently."
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that a controversy sparked in the
political horizon of Iran following a statement issued Thursday
by 16 senior government officials, including 10 ministers, four
deputy ministers, the governor of the Central Bank of Iran and
Tehran's mayor.
</P>
<P>
They believe that more conflicts will occur between ruling
clergymen and non-clergymen officials and among the ruling
clergymen themselves as the Parliamentary elections are
approaching.
</P>
<P>
The senior officials in their statement declared their support
for the policies and plans of President Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
A political analyst said that the statement is in fact a
declaration of a new political entity, short of the formation of a
political party.
</P>
<P>
The analyst does not rule out the possibility that the new
political entity may turn into a full-fledged political party,
predicting that more people will join the entity.
</P>
<P>
Most importantly, the political entity has made a list of
candidates for the forthcoming Parliamentary election slated for
March 8, thus provoking conflict with the rightist camp headed by
Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri.
</P>
<P>
Javad Larijani, who belongs to the rightist camp, criticized
the Group-16 statement, saying that if it was a political party,
then it should have its manifesto, and the identity of its leader
should be made public.

According to the commissioner, the purpose of the meeting is to
launch the preparation of communication strategies at European and
national levels through discussions with senior representatives of
all sectors involved.
</P>
<P>
To this end the EC suggested that a "Patronage Committee" be
established to bring together high level personalities "who have
played, who are playing and who will play important roles" in
meeting the tremendous challenge of the introduction of the single
currency.
</P>
<P>
The work of the three-day meeting is organised around three
workshops which respectively deals with the problems and the needs
of consumers, enterprises, particularly in the banking and
financial sector, and public administrations.

<HEADLINE> Indian Ruling Party Clarifies Position on Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Indian ruling National
Congress (Indira) today rejected suggestions that about half a
dozen cabinet ministers who have been named in the diary of the
alleged Hawala dealers should resign and denied there was any
turmoil in the party over the scandal.
</P>
<P>
Just because their name appears in the diary, there is no need
to resign, the party spokesman V. N. Gadgil told reporters in
reply to questions.
</P>
<P>
The statement of Gadgil assumed significance in the wake of the
letter written by Environment Minister Rajesh Pilot to Prime
Minister P. V. Narasimha Rao, asking him to clarify whether these
ministers who came under cloud should continue in office.
</P>
<P>
Pilot had threatened to resign because he was reportedly named
in the Hawala dealers' diary which has the name list of
politicians who allegedly received slush money from the illegal
foreign exchange traders.
</P>
<P>
Gadgil said that all those charged including the three resigned
ministers and opposition leaders were innocent till the court
comes to a different conclusion.
</P>
<P>
The matter is only at the stage of charge sheets, nothing has
been proved yet, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Gadgil's comment came amidst reports of increasing resentment
and turmoil among the Congress party over the multi-crore rupee
scandal.
</P>
<P>
The five-year-old scandal was revived last Tuesday when the
Central Bureau of Investigation filed charge sheets against seven
top politicians, including opposition Bharatiya Janata Party
President L. K. Advani, and sought the president's nod to
prosecute three ministers for their alleged involvement in the
case.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Hawala scandal today
claimed yet another victim as the Janata Dal parliamentary party
leader, Sharad Yadav, resigned his Lok Sabha (lower house of the
Indian parliament) seat.
</P>
<P>
Announcing his resignation, Yadav told a press conference here
he is resigning on moral grounds although he has not received any
funds from the Jain brothers (suspected hawala dealers) connected
with the hawala racket.
</P>
<P>
Yadav is the second opposition leader to quit the Lok Sabha
seat after Bharatiya Janata Party President L.K. Advani, who has
been charged by the Central Bureau of Investigation in the
multi-crore rupee hawala scandal. however, the CBI has not moved
against Yadav.
</P>
<P>
The linkage of his name with the hawala scandal was weighing
heavily on his mind and so he had decided to quit his Lok Sabha
seat after consulting senior leaders of the party, he said.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Lok Sabha Speaker Shivraj Patil, Yadav said that
it is my conviction that those occupying high public offices
should quit if the people suspect their involvement in corruption
and that all efforts should be made to remove these doubts.
</P>
<P>
He requested that his resignation be accepted with immediate
effect.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Firms Urged to Abide by Law on Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The implementation of the
occupational health and safety program among companies is still
poor in Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Most workers are unaware of the importance of the program which
was introduced and passed into law 26 years ago, according to
Benny Priatna, head of the Jakarta Center for the Implementation
of the Safety Program, here today at a seminar.
</P>
<P>
Workers are busy struggling for higher minimum daily wages,
workers are willing to work for money and ignore the fact that
conditions at the workplace and the equipment they use do not meet
requirements set by the government.
</P>
<P>
There are 34,000 companies operating in Jakarta, but no
accurate record of how many have implemented the safety and health
program.
</P>
<P>
The program was first introduced and regulated in 1970 and
aimed at improving workers' productivity and welfare.
</P>
<P>
The program necessitates the proper layout of workplaces,
pleasant work environment and protection from various types of
pollution.
</P>
<P>
In short, the program, if properly implemented, protects
workers from occupational illness and accidents.
</P>
<P>
However, few workers realize that many of them suffer from
deadly illnesses they contracted while at the workplace, because
symptoms of the illnesses appear years after infection.
</P>
<P>
The companies which have been reluctant to improve the
conditions of the workplace or provide facilities for the safety
of the workers were urged to abide by law on safety.
</P>
<P>
According to the regulation, owners of companies that fail to
implement the program face three months imprisonment or a fine.

<HEADLINE> Vice-Premier Calls for Better Production Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo
urged governments at all levels to pay greater attention to
production safety in order to create a "good environment for
economic construction and social stability."
</P>
<P>
Despite the fact that great progress has been made in
production methods, "We still cannot be optimistic about the
production situation," the vice-premier said at a national
tele-conference on production safety here today.
</P>
<P>
"Years of experience have shown us that the the solar and lunar
new year usually have a higher number of accidents, Wu noted.
</P>
<P>
"Recent months have seen greater frequency of accidents at
construction sites, coal mines, fires, and in traffic," he said,
adding that this "deserves greater attention of governments at all
levels."
</P>
<P>
Wu asked that relevant departments work out a plan for better
production safety in drawing up the Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1996-2000) and the long-term plans for the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
"First, production safety must be based on science and
technology," he explained. "Second, all regions and all
departments concerned must have a pretty good idea of any hidden
dangers and take precautionary measures."
</P>
<P>
"Third, labor departments must strengthen supervision of
production safety," he said. "Fourth, an insurance system linking
industrial accidents with production safety must be set up."
</P>
<P>
Wu urged governments at all levels to take seriously the
production problems. "People who are responsible for accidents
must be punished in accordance with law," he said.
</P>
<P>
"During busy transportation periods, examination of inflammable
and explosive materials must be done thoroughly," he said.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Muslims Greet Ramadan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian Muslims flocked to
mosques across the country today marking the beginning of the holy
fasting month of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
Today, Muslims will refrain from eating, drinking or engaging
in sexual life from dawn to dusk.
</P>
<P>
Some schools established by Muslim organizations will either
give students a month-long holiday or reduce the length of school
hours.
</P>
<P>
Some companies and offices have also decided to shorten working
hours.
</P>
<P>
In a televised message to greet Ramadan last night, Minister of
Religious Affairs Tarmizi Taher called on Indonesian Muslims to
observe fasting well in order to strengthen their faith, and build
solidarity with the poor and the weak.
</P>
<P>
The ministry announced that Ramadan will begin today after the
government and independent Muslim organizations are satisfied with
the results of methods employed to determine the onset of Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
The beginning of the fasting month in Indonesia is determined
by both the calculation by arithmetic means and the sighting of
the new moon.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is the biggest Muslim country in the world with 90
percent of its 195 million population being Muslims.

<P>
XI'AN, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua
urged accelerated development in northwest China and greater
emphasis on local agriculture, energy resources, and
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
These remarks came during a visit to Shaanxi Province between
January 15 and 21.
</P>
<P>
Zou noted that the planning was not suited to China's fast
economic growth. The socialist market economy is the result of the
reforms, he pointed out, explaining that China will let public
ownership take the lead and stick to a common wealth policy,
giving full play to economic strengths, improving technology,
management, and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
Shaanxi Province has many advantages, including energy and
tourism resources, Zou said, while pointing out that agriculture
should be given priority.
</P>
<P>
He also stated that industrial reforms are very important for
economic progress.

<P>
JERUSALEM, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The world's largest cosmetics
company, L'Oreal, announced today that it has acquired a further
35.5 percent stake in Interbeauty, Israel's leading cosmetics
group.
</P>
<P>
Following the acquisition, L'Oreal will hold 65.5 percent of
Interbeauty's capital stock. The remaining Interbeauty stock will
continue to be held by private Israeli investors.
</P>
<P>
In May 1994, L'Oreal became Interbeauty's largest shareholder,
with 30 percent of the equity interest. In the near future,
L'Oreal intends to further increase its investment in Interbeauty

</P>
<P>
Interbeauty, whose turnover reached 100 million shekels (about
33.3 million U.S. dollars) in 1995, markets all L'Oreal products,

by an independent agent. L'Oreal brands distributed by Interbeauty
in Israel include L'Oreal Parfumerie (Plenitude, Studio Line,
Elserve), Helena Rubinstein, Lancome, Cacharel, Ralph Lauren,
Paloma Picasso and Vichy.
</P>
<P>
In January 1995, Interbeauty started to manufacture L'Oreal's
products in the Migdal HaEmek plant, which produced four million
units each year.
</P>
<P>
"We are delighted with this closer links between L'Oreal and
Interbeauty," said Gad Proper, who today was confirmed as chairman
of Interbeauty. He added that this investment demonstrates that
L'Oreal is fully confident in Interbeauty's capacities for
innovation and development.

<HEADLINE> US Ambassador Says Her Country Does Not Seek to Divide Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Permanent Delegate to the
U.N. Madeleine Albright said here today that the United States
does not seek to divide Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Albright said after meeting with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak that Washington believes that Iraq should remain a one
country though her country supports maintaining U.N. sanctions
imposed on Iraq following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
She said that the sanctions should remain in place to make
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein's regime respect the rights of the
Kurds in northern Iraq and Shiites in the south, underlining that
those people should not be punished for their views.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi economy has been hard hit by the five-year-old
sanctions, including a ban on oil exports, the country's main
source of foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
Albright voiced the U.S. appreciation of Egypt's continued
efforts to maintain world peace, highlighting Egypt's contribution
to peace-keeping operations in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Some 650 Egyptian soldiers have been members of the
U.N. peace-keeping force in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who arrived in Cairo Sunday at the end of a
five-nation African tour, said the Egyptian people should be proud
of the historic role played by Egypt as a member of the
U.N. Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Egypt joined the Security Council earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. ambassador said she discussed with Mubarak means of
supporting African peace-keeping operations and the importance of
restructuring the U.N. to enable the world organization to have a
more effective role in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
She also expressed concern about Sudan's refusal to hand over
to Ethiopia the three suspects involved in the failed
assassination attempt on Mubarak in Addis Ababa last June.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. is studying several options on the issue, she said.
</P>
<P>
Ethiopia has asked the Security Council to consider sanctions
against Sudan to make it surrender the suspects.
</P>
<P>
Albright was to meet with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
later today.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Universities to Charge Students for Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Half of all colleges and
universities in China will charge students for the education they
receive, stating in the fall semester, said a senior official of
the State Education Commission (SEC) here today.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the moves listed at the top of the SEC's agenda,
said Liu Bin, vice-minister of the SEC, at the '96 National
Education Working Conference that opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that because some 500 colleges and universities will
make students pay fees this year, China will have stricter rules
on tuition. Local governments are encouraged to establish college
grants or other forms of aid.
</P>
<P>
The SEC has asked that students who are poor be charged lower
tuition rates or none at all. Since the government decided to get
students to pay for part of their college tuition in 1994, 245
colleges and universities have carried out the change.
</P>
<P>
The central government has allocated more than 200 million yuan
(over 24 million U.S. dollars) to support poor students to finish
their schooling.
</P>
<P>
An information network for college graduates will be set up
soon to help provide information on the job market for college
graduates.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu, the SEC will continue its work to popularize
nine-year compulsory education and eliminate illiteracy among
people under 45 and above 15, with plans to help four million such
people this year.
</P>
<P>
This year is the 10th anniversary of the Law on Compulsory
Education. The SEC and the National People's Congress (NPC), the
country's top legislature, will examine implementation of that law
and the Education Law and the Teachers' Law across the country.
</P>
<P>
The SEC is drafting a higher education law and plans to submit
it to the NPC Standing Committee for consideration this year.
</P>
<P>
Liu recalled the achievements made in educational development
during the Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995), saying that
it was one of the best periods for educational development in
China.
</P>
<P>
Directors of 30 provincial education committees attended the
three-day meeting to discuss the Ninth Five-Year Plan for
Education and a 15-year development plan (1996-2010) suggested by
the SEC.

<HEADLINE> Relics from "Maritime Silk Route" on Display in HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 22 (Xinhua) -- An exhibition opening here
tomorrow will display precious relics dating back as long as 2200
years ago, which were unearthed in different locations along the
South China coast.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, entitled "The Maritime Silk Route: 2000 Years
of Trade on the South China Sea" is staged in the Hong Kong Museum
 of History, with the opening ceremony held this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is jointly presented by the Hong Kong Museum of
History, the Guangzhou Museum and the Guangdong Provincial Museum.
</P>
<P>
Also among the over 100 exhibits chosen from the collections of
 the museums and supplemented by items on loan from the Macau
Maritime Museum are export items, ship models, historical pictures
 and maps.
</P>
<P>
There were two commercial and cultural routes that linked China
 with Europe in ancient times. One began at Chang'an (present-day
 Xi'an) in Northwest China, and crossed desert, snow-covered
mountains and steppes to reach Western Asia. This was the
celebrated "Silk Road".
</P>
<P>
The other route began at Guangzhou, now the capital of South
China's Guangdong Province, and crossed the South China Sea and
the Indian Ocean to reach the Mediterranean. It was the Maritime
Silk Road.
</P>
<P>
"The former is more famous, but in terms of length of service
and extent of commercial and cultural contact it carried between
China and the West, the Maritime Silk Road surpasses its
counterpart on land," said Mok Ying-fan, Chairman of the Urban
Council Museum Select Committee, at the opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"The trio of Guangzhou, Hong Kong and Macau each had a special
role to play in the development of the Maritime Silk Road," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In initiating the exhibition, which will last more than three
months, the Hong Kong museum is "to make known this piece of
history to the Hong Kong public," Mok added.
</P>
<P>
Among the exhibits are some of the relics excavated from the
site of shipyard believed to be built during the Qin Dynasty
(221-207 B.C.), lacquer flasks painted with rhinoceros design,
pottery models of elephant tusks and rhinoceros horns, incense
burners, lamps, strings of beads and a Roman blue glass bowel
recovered from a tomb built during the Han Dynasty (206 B.C. - 220
 A.D.).
</P>
<P>
A series of lectures are also to be conducted during the
exhibition period.

<HEADLINE> Fujian to Give Priority to Science and Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, January 22 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian Province
will give priority to developing science and technology, in a move
to give its already booming economy a further push, especially its
pillar industries.
</P>
<P>
Over the past decade, science and technology have contributed
35 percent of the province's economic growth, two-thirds of its
industrial growth, and added two billion yuan to agricultural
product value.
</P>
<P>
To date, some 70 percent of science and technology personnel in
Fujian's research institutes are involved in the economic sectors,
and the number of new products annually is more than 1,000 for the
eighth consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, some 60 percent of the province's scientific and
technological achievements have been put to use and 1,316 of them
have brought an additional 7.62 billion yuan in product value.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from related departments, the province has
decided to pin development hopes on the economically booming
southeastern part, including a special economic zone, Taiwanese
investment zones, bonded areas, and high-tech zones.
</P>
<P>
In the important petrochemical, electronics, and construction
materials sectors, the province will concentrate on exploiting new
products and new technology and introducing advanced developments,
hoping to eventually form pillar industries.
</P>
<P>
In some promising new sectors, the province is planning on
boosting development of six high-tech development zones by means
of industrialization and internationalization, but will continue
its 250 high-tech projects and support ten big high-tech projects
to develop high-tech enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Expects Close Cooperation with Greece </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Cyprus government believes
it will have "very close cooperation" with the new Greek
government led by Premier Costas Simitis, a senior government
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, government spokesman
Yiannakis Cassoulides said "the Cyprus government expects and is
sure that it will have a warm and very close cooperation with the
government of Prime Minister Costas Simitis."
</P>
<P>
He added the government would also like to express
"satisfaction that two important ministries, which deal with
Cyprus, have been taken by persons who are well acquainted with
the Cyprus problem."
</P>
<P>
Cassoulides was referring to the Foreign Ministry taken over
by Theodoros Pangalos, replacing Karolos Papoulias, and the
Ministry of National Defense taken over by Yerasimos Arsenis.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman expressed the government's satisfaction with the
"cooperation, support and assistance" it has had from former
Foreign Minister Karolos Papoulias.
</P>
<P>
Referring to President Glafcos Clerides' proposed visit to
Athens, the spokesman said the President would do so at a time to
be fixed at a later stage.
</P>
<P>
This East Mediterranean island has been divided since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and took control of the northern third of
its territory following a short-lived Athens-back coup.
</P>
<P>
Greece, together with Turkey and Britain, were the guarantors
of Cyprus' independence under the 1960 Treaty of establishment of
the Cyprus Republic.
</P>
<P>
Greece and Turkey, both NATO allies, have been at odds over
Cyprus for many years.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus and Greece have agreed to adopt a joint defense
pact. The agreement was reached in November 1993 by Cyprus
President Clerides and former Greek Premier Andreas Papandreou.
</P>
<P>
Athens has warned Ankara that any advance of the Turkish
troops toward the southern government-controlled part of the
island would mean war between the two neighboring countries.

<HEADLINE> Supervisory System of Guarantee Deposits Beneficial Says Zhu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The earnest money deposit
supervisory system is conducive to the smooth development of the
processing industry in China, Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the new system will be in place nationwide by the
latter half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remarks while visiting south China's Guangdong
Province between January 18 and 21 accompanied by Xie Fei,
Guangdong Provincial Party Committee secretary, and Zhu Senlin,
governor of the province.
</P>
<P>
He heard reports on a pilot system of earnest money accounts
covering imported raw materials and spare parts for the processing
industry in the cities of Dongguan, Suzhou and Ningbo. Zhu noted
that in recent years the industry has made rapid progress and that
total import and export volume for the industry constituted 47
percent in the country's overall import and export volume in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The state has decided that raw materials and spare parts for
the processing business can exempt from import taxes.
</P>
<P>
However, Zhu said, a big proportion of the processed products
were not exported from China, but sold domestically, leading to
large losses of state tax revenues, affecting the country's
agricultural and industrial production.
</P>
<P>
Last November, the State Council decided on a pilot system of
cash deposit accounts in the three cities to help the industry's
healthy development, to stop smuggling, to guarantee collection of
state tax revenues, and to protect the nation's agriculture and
industry.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier said that the experiment has proven to be both
successful and practical, and that it will improve the supervision
of raw material imports and of spare parts for the processing
industry, and will not add a burden to enterprises or affect their
normal operations.

<HEADLINE> Iran Exports 1 Billion Dollar Oil to South Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Iran has become South Africa's
top oil importer by exporting some 1 billion U.S. dollars worth of
oil to the country in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The English-language daily Iran News today quoted South
African Ambassador to Tehran Moosa Muhammad Moola as saying here
Sunday in a seminar on South Africa market that such a great
volume of trade represents the vast expansion of trade between the
two nations.
</P>
<P>
After the Islamic Revolution of 1979, Iran stopped its oil
export to South Africa as a gesture of solidarity with the blacks
fighting for self-determination.
</P>
<P>
The London-based weekly Petroleum Argus, however, wrote in its
latest issue that although Iran's share of South African market
was 58 percent, Pretoria was looking forward to increasing the
shares of Iran's competitors, Kuwait and Angola.
</P>
<P>
The weekly reported that on an average, South Africa imported
215,000 barrels of oil from Iran each day in 1995.
</P>
<P>
It predicted that the level of oil import from Iran could be
reduced to 165,000 barrels if South Africa bought more oil from
Kuwait and Angola.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Salam said today that oil experts believe
that the reduction in Iran's oil export to South Africa would only
be temporary.
</P>
<P>
"When Iran and South Africa start their cooperation to deposit
Iran's oil in a port near the Cape of Good Hope and when they will
start joint marketing venture of Iran's oil in Europe and South
America, which is said to yield an annual profit of 266 million
dollars for South Africa, the relations between the two countries
will be given a boost," said Salam.
</P>
<P>
Iran News quoted an Iranian official as saying that South
Africa "constituted a lucrative market" for Iran and that "the
two countries can work out a favorable trade link."
</P>
<P>
South African ambassador Moola also told the daily that South
Africa could easily replace Iran's European trade partners, saying
that his country had made great strides in mining, industry,
technology and trade.
</P>
<P>
Moola said that the two countries were studying the
establishment of a shipping line which would help enhance their
trade links.

<HEADLINE> More Japanese Companies to Invest in HK, China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Japanese companies are to
increase their presence in Hong Kong after 1997, using it as a
regional business base, according to senior representatives of
Japan's business community who met their Hong Kong counterparts
here today.
</P>
<P>
In a joint communique issued at the end of the 18th Plenary
Session of the Hong Kong/Japan and Japan/Hong Kong Business
Co-operation Committee, Japanese business leaders said that they
would continue to use Hong Kong as a gateway to China and a center
for souring and distributing across the region.
</P>
<P>
"With its free port, low tax, fair regulatory environment and
strategic location in the region, Hong Kong would continue to play
a pivotal role in Asia's economic development," said the
communique.
</P>
<P>
Presented and discussed at the meeting, attended by some 40
members of the Committees, were the results of a recent survey
undertaken for the Hong Kong/Japan Business Co-operation Committee
on Hong Kong as a regional souring and distribution center base
for Japanese companies.
</P>
<P>
In anticipating Hong Kong's role in the coming years, 76 pre
cent of respondents, all of whom are Japanese companies presently
operating in Hong Kong, believed Hong Kong would be increasingly
important as a gateway to China.
</P>
<P>
Some 90 pre cent said they would increase their activities in
China in coming years and 66.5 pre cent said they would increase
activities in Hong Kong. At the same time, 82.2 per cent and 65.5
per cent of respondents indicated they would increase their
purchase of products made in China and other Asian countries,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
More than 75 per cent said their purchase of Hong Kong-made
products would remain unchanged or would slightly increase.
</P>
<P>
The survey noted a 53 per cent increase in the number of
Japanese companies using Hong Kong as a regional headquarters over
the past three years, from 273 in 1992 to 419 in 1995. There are
now over 2,000 Japanese companies operating in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
According to the communique, recent public statements by
Chinese leaders, emphasizing their commitment to preserving Hong
Kong's high degree of autonomy and economic dynamism, were helpful
in reassuring Japanese businessmen about Hong Kong's future.
</P>
<P>
The two committees also felt that Hong Kong's advantage as a
business hub and a channel for investments in China's mainland
would become more significant after 1997 as China's economy
continued to develop in line with China's ninth Five-year Plan.
</P>
<P>
"Both of us agreed that Hong Kong has a very bright future and
that Japan continues to invest in Hong Kong and Japan and Hong
Kong continue to invest in a joint-venture manner, in China," said
Raymond Ch'ien, chairman of the Hong Kong/Japan Committee.
"There are a lot of confidence here," he said.
</P>
<P>
And consumer market "is an area with a lot of opportunity for
Hong Kong-Japan co-operation," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Japan equally has a very important role to play," said
Tomiichi Akiyama, chairman of the Japan/Hong Kong Committee.
</P>
<P>
"Looking into Japan's economical structure, we need to continue
 to establish production facilities as well as to transfer
technologies and continue to invest overseas," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed that Japan and Hong Kong will continue to
made joint efforts to establish joint-venture enterprises in
China.

<HEADLINE> Ninth Five-Year Plan for Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- China will strengthen its basic
education, help higher education grow, improve the quality of
education, and continue educational reforms during the Ninth
Five-Year Plan (1996-2000).
</P>
<P>
This news was revealed by Liu Bin, vice-minister in charge of
the State Education Commission (SEC), at the '96 National
Educational Working Conference held here today.
</P>
<P>
To spread nine-year compulsory education and basically
eliminate illiteracy among people under the age of 45 will be the
focus of SEC's work in 1996, Liu said, adding that this is
essential for improving the overall educational level and quality
of Chinese life.
</P>
<P>
The illiteracy rate among people under age of 45 and above the
age of 15 should be less than five percent by the year 2000. The
rate is currently just below seven percent.
</P>
<P>
The number of college students will reach 6.5 million. It was
2.9 million at the end of 1995. The number of colleges and
universities however will decline because the government believes
that efficiency in education is more important.
</P>
<P>
The SEC urged colleges and universities to share educational
resources by means of inter-school cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"Project 211" will receive 10 billion yuan (about 1.2 billion
U.S. dollars) over five years for building up 100 key higher
education institutions and key centers. It is designed to prepare
colleges and universities for challenges in the 21st
century. Hence the name "211".
</P>
<P>
Vocational and adult education will be developed, with more
than 12.7 million students in vocational schools, or 60 percent of
all students receiving high school education.
</P>
<P>
The government will not be the only one to run schools, because
non-governmental organizations or individuals will be encouraged
to run them, especially vocational schools.
</P>
<P>
The government will still be the major developer of higher
education, but society's participation and joint efforts are
welcomed.
</P>
<P>
During the Ninth Five-Year Plan, the government will subsidize
colleges and students will pay part of their college fees. By
1997, all colleges and universities will charge students
tuition. According to the SEC plan, 500 colleges and universities,
or nearly half of all colleges and universities in the country
will charge students for tuition fees this year.
</P>
<P>
College graduates will be able to choose jobs with policy

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
here today that China should learn from foreign experience in
accounting, auditing, and other fields, in addition to absorbing
technology, management and equipment.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with Peter Smith, chairman of Coopers &AMP; Lybrand
(C&AMP;L), and his party at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse here today,
Li praised the multinational firm for its cooperation with China
over the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
C&AMP;L is one of the world's leading providers of services for
accounting, auditing, taxes, and consultation. Li welcomed the
firm to hold its board of directors meeting for the first time in
China.
</P>
<P>
Li said that the current development trend of China's economy,
which has a solid foundation, is expected to continue for the next
five to 15 years.
</P>
<P>
In developing the economy and foreign trade, and especially in
establishing a socialist market economy, China needs the
cooperation of many intermediary agencies, such as accounting,
auditing, and law firms, Li pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He described accounting as an "intelligence-intensive" service,
and added that China should learn more from foreign experience in
this regard.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that C&AMP;L hire more Chinese personnel. "China
has rich intellectual resources, and localization is the
development direction of international companies," he explained.
</P>
<P>
The premier said that international practices should be
incorporated into China's economy "step by step", but, at the same
time, he stressed that China is a developing country with its own
distinctive characteristics and laws.
</P>
<P>
As long as foreign partners become accustomed to, and abide by,
China's laws, there are great prospects for cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Smith said that his firm has a long history of good cooperation
with China, and that it is willing to be a part of China's great
economic changes by building a bridge between foreign investors
and Chinese enterprises.
</P>
<P>
C&AMP;L is a 140-year-old corporation based in Switzerland, with
clients world-wide in more than 130 countries. At present its
investment in China surpasses its total in other countries of the
world.

<P>
Mogadishu, January 22 (Xinhua) -- At least six gunmen were
kill and 14 others wounded when fighting erupted on Sunday in
Tieglow district 70 kilometers west of Huddur in southern
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The conflict was between militiamen of General Mohamed Farah
Aideed and those of the Rahanwein Resistance Army (RRA). 10
armed wagons belonging to Aideed's militiamen attacked Tieglow
on Sunday afternoon, according to Colonel Hassan Mohamed Nur
(Shatigudud), chief militia commander of the RRA.
</P>
<P>
Shatigudud, who is currently visiting North Mogadishu, told
reporters today that his militiamen in front would not be fasting
for the Holy Ramadan month since the Sharia permits not to fast
during the Holy fighting against what he called the renegades.
However, some religious elders disputed the pretext of
Shatigudud.
</P>
<P>
Shatigudud said his visit in North Mogadishu was aimed at
seeing the politicians and the militia commanders of the Somali
Salvation Alliance (SSA) supporting Ali Mahdi Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
There was also another fighting reported to be taking place
in Habarre villages between the RRA and Aideed's militiamen.
Radio Ali Mahdi supporting the RRA said Aideed had lost more
than five gunmen and many others were wounded during a bitter
fighting early on Sunday morning.

ISLAMABAD, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan government today
offered a unilateral cease-fire to mark the start of the Muslim
fasting month of Ramadan, said a report from Kabul.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the Afghan student militia Taliban and other
factions also observe the cease-fire and open the highways for the
Kabul people," said Defense Ministry spokesman Abdullah.
</P>
<P>
The government's gesture should be used as a catalyst to start
peace negotiations between President Burhanuddin Rabbani and other
warring factions in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Taliban, the main faction against the Kabul regime, has been
besieging the Afghan capital of Kabul since last October in a bid
to topple President Rabbani by force.
</P>
<P>
The main supply route from Pakistan's border city of Peshawar
to Kabul has been cut off for the last nine days, leading to an

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Senior leader of India's
major opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, Atal Behari Vajpayee,
today reaffirmed his charge against Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha
Rao in the multi-crore rupee Hawala case.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee did so while speaking to reporters in Bhopal, capital
of Madhya Pradesh state, said the Press Trust of India.
</P>
<P>
According to the opposition leader, the Central Bureau of
Investigation (CBI) did not deny his allegation that the prime
minister had taken three crore rupees (about 838,000 US dollars)
in the Hawala case.
</P>
<P>
He said that he attached no importance to a denial by the
ruling Congress Party spokesman V.N. Gadgil of the charge against
Rao.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating that he made the charge with the fullest sense of
responsibility, Vajpayee said he was aware that Rao's name did not
figure in the 1991 diary referred to in the Hawala scandal.
</P>
<P>
The diary, discovered by the CBI in the residence of one of the
suspected Hawala dealers of foreign exchange, has a list of
politicians who allegedly received slush money.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee said that according to information available to him,
the Hawala dealers told the CBI that they had paid three crore
rupees (about 838,000 US dollars) to Rao.
</P>
<P>
Noting that this statement by the Hawala dealers was on
document with the CBI, the opposition leader demanded that it
should be made public.

<HEADLINE> HK Rolling Forex Develops Successfully </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Rolling Forex, a new currency
futures product launched by Hong Kong Futures Exchange (HKFE)
Ltd. last November, has recorded steady growth in the first 11
weeks of trading, said Ivers Riley, Chief Executive Officer of
the HKFE.
</P>
<P>
Riley said at a press briefing today that HKFE has taken steps
to improve the trading environment to ensure continued success of
Rolling Forex.
</P>
<P>
In November 1995 when Rolling Forex was launched, the average
daily turnover for the Deutschemark and Yen together was 704
contracts. Although the average daily volume dropped to 362
contracts in December, it quickly recovered in January to 733
contracts.
</P>
<P>
Riley said it is most encouraging that there has been a
significant increase of investors' participation in Rolling Forex
during this month. In November, the number of transactions made by
non-registered traders was averaged at around 20 percent, while
from January 2 to January 18, the average percentage rose to
approximately 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said that, to further improve the operation of Rolling
Forex, HKFE has made a number of new arrangements to suit customer
needs and has plans to implement a new round of promotional and
marketing programs.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Denounces U.S. War Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) condemned today the United States for
spreading the rumor of "threat from North Korea" and conducting
military exercises jointly with South Korea off the west coast of
Korea.
</P>
<P>
The official DPRK paper Rodong Sinmun said in a commentary that
Washington's allegation of "threat from North Korea" and "threat
from China" is nothing but a trick to help realize its ambition of
exercising hegemony in Asia.
</P>
<P>
It is precisely under the pretext of forestalling such
"threats" that the United States has conducted various war games
with Japan and South Korea and is now trying to increase its
military presence in South Korea, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The United States has never changed its ambition of world
hegemony and East Asia is its first target, the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The United States should understand that its dream of an
exclusive military control over Asia will never come true and that
only genuine peace and relaxation of tension in the Korean
Peninsula and its vicinity are in its own interests.
</P>
<P>
In another strongly-worded commentary, the newspaper slammed
the U.S. joint mock warfare with South Korea as being "aimed at
invading the DPRK."
</P>
<P>
According to a Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) report,
involved in the 10-day-long military exercise begun on Saturday
are "two submarines and nine surface ships such as destroyers
belonging to the U.S. Seventh Fleet as well as four anti-submarine
patrol planes." The report added another large-scale joint naval
exercise is scheduled for February 13.
</P>
<P>
These activities of the United States are "aggravating the
tensions on the Korean Peninsula extremely," the commentary said.
</P>
<P>
The commentary said U.S. hard-liners are still trying to
isolate and stifle socialism in the DPRK although the two
countries reached a framework nuclear agreement in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Former South Korean Prime Minister Lee to Join Ruling Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Former South Korean Prime
Minister Lee Hoi-chang will join the ruling New Korea Party (NKP)
to assist the party with its campaign in the general elections in
April, Presidential Spokesman Yoon Yeo-joon said here today.
</P>
<P>
Lee, who served as prime minister under President Kim Young-sam
from 1993 to 1994, decided to join the NKP at the request of Kim
during their meeting here this morning, Yoon said.
</P>
<P>
At the early stage of the current administration, Lee took
office as chairman of the Board of Audit and Inspection and later
became prime minister.
</P>
<P>
He resigned reportedly due to discord with President Kim in
1994.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference shortly after the presidential spokesman
announced his scheduled entry into the ruling party, Lee said that
he decided to join the NKP in order to contribute to the
development of politics in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
"I hope I will be able to contribute my poor ability, if any,
to establish a cleaner and more advanced political culture where
law and principle are respected," Lee said.
</P>
<P>
"It was difficult for me, as a person who participated in the
current civilian government from its early stage, to turn down the
earnest wish of President Kim who wanted political stability at
this difficult time," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The NKP has tried to invite influential figures in an effort to
strengthen its campaign for the forthcoming general elections on
April 11.
</P>
<P>
Lee is the second political "big shot" to become a member of
the NKP in less than a week. Former lawmaker Park Chan-jong joined
the party last week.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources here said that the ex-prime minister will be
assigned as the head of the party's election campaign
headquarters. He is also reportedly the top candidate to become a
national assemblyman for the NKP under the national representation
system.

<HEADLINE> IFAD Pledges To Support Poverty Alleviation In Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The International Fund
for Agriculture Development (IFAD) has pledged 19.38 million US
dollars for poverty alleviation in Mara Region, Northern
Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by the Deputy Minister for Agriculture and
Cooperative, Njelu Kasaka, here on Sunday shortly after arrival
from Rome, Italy, where he signed the agreement last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kasaka told reporters that the funds would be released to
establish the Mara Regional Farmers Initiative Project (MRFIP).
</P>
<P>
The project, he said, would promote agricultural production
and livestock breeding in the region.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister said prior to the release of funds, IFAD
demanded a gender assessment to determine how women would benefit
from the project. "Women have been the most marginalised people,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
According to Kasaka, this is the fourth such project in the
country. The first one is Southern Highlands Smallholder
Extension and Rural Financing Project catering for Ruvuma, Mbeya,
Rukwa and Iringa regions.
</P>
<P>
The two others are the Smallholder Development Project for
Marginal Areas for Dodoma, Singida, Mwanza, Shinyanga and Tabora,
and the Water Supply and Health Project catering for Dodoma
Region.
</P>
<P>
Kasaka said IFAD had been highly impressed with the
implementation of the first three projects, which influenced IFAD
pledging for the Mara project.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister also said, the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO) had offered to support the War against
Contageous Bolven Pleuropneumonia (CBPP), a new animal disease in
Tanzania and southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
He said, another area of support by FAO was elimination of
locusts, which threatens agricultural production in Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Patients' Right-to-Die to be Respected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Preliminary discussions of
Hong Kong Medical Association (HKMA) on euthanasia have concluded
that doctors should have the right not to revive dying patients
who have made an earlier request that they not be resuscitated.
</P>
<P>
Today's Easter Express, a local English newspaper, reported
that the Ethics Committee of the HKMA endorsed the view that
doctors should respect patients' wishes concerning their rejection
of any resuscitation while on the verge of death.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the committee Ko Wing-man said as long as patients
had refused treatment, including the maintenance of life using
medical equipment, their will should be respected.
</P>
<P>
This meant that doctors would be allowed to switch off
life-support machines if a patient had made it clear that he or
she wished to refuse treatment.
</P>
<P>
Ko said the committee was still undecided over whether a doctor
should withhold treatment for patients who had become
"vegetables" and thus unable to express their will.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the committee was firmly against more
advanced forms of euthanasia, such as physician-assisted suicide.

collapse.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:

<HEADLINE> Service Industry Thriving in Fujian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Service trade has enjoyed a fast
growth in southeast China's Fujian Province over the past 17
years, accounting for 34 percent of its gross domestic products
(GDP).
</P>
<P>
Annual value-added output of the service industry amounted to
about 57.3 billion yuan in 1994, 40 times the figure in 1978 when
China adopted the policy of reform and opening to the outside
world.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the sector now employs a staff of more
than three million, making up 23.3 percent of the province's total
employment.
</P>
<P>
Within the sector, posts and telecommunications,
transportation, foreign and domestic trade, and tourism have
registered the fastest pace of growth.
</P>
<P>
Fujian spearheaded China's program to modernize the posts and
telecommunications network. In the 1980s, the province was the
first to install 10,000 program-controlled telephones and the
first to achieve automation in urban and long-distance telephone
services.
</P>
<P>
During the 1991-1995 period, Fujian digited its phone network
linking cities with counties, with wireless paging and mobile
phones covering the whole province. Since its installation of
China's first optical fibre line in 1987, the province has built
23 optical fibres and 15 micro-wave, digital trunk lines.
</P>
<P>
The traditional catering trade also flourished, witnessing
myriads of changes in both quality and quantity. The sector boasts
over 50,000 restaurants and hotels with a staff of 110,000.
</P>
<P>
After years of intensive building, the province has established
a complete network of transportation, with convenient links of
air, road, rail and waterway traffic. Transportation has become a
pillar in Fujian's service industry.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade in Fujian Province has been growing at an annual
average of 26 percent. Exports totalled 8.2 billion US dollars in
1994, ranking 4th in China. The province received 840,000 overseas
travellers in 1994 and earnings hit two billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The booming of service trades has injected vitality into local
economy and helped bolster the development of other sectors.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Control of Women-Trafficking Urged in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Nepalese authorities have
been urged to take more concrete measures to control the rampant
situation of women-trafficking in the country.
</P>
<P>
Though the government has been taking stern legal action
against those involved in women-trafficking and social workers
for women rights have been calling for the public awareness
against this activity, the trade of women is still flourishing in
this Himalayan kingdom, especially in its remote rural areas.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are more than 300,000 Nepalese women
working in prostitution in neighboring India and many of them were
sold there by traffickers with the help of their parents, brothers
and even husbands in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
Participants of a recent seminar on women-trafficking and its
control held in north Nepal's Sindhupalchok district, where the
situation of women-trafficking is the worst in the country, have
urged the government to adopt some fundamental measures such as
providing employment opportunities for village women and
generating the awareness among rural people to eradicate this
evil phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, organized by local police and the National
Organization for Rural Women's Education, were participated by
representatives of local people, teachers, journalists, police
officers, lawyers, social workers and women activists.
</P>
<P>
It discussed the current condition of women-trafficking,
reasons for failure to control the illegal trade and new measures
the authorities could adopt in the future.
</P>
<P>
According to the organizers, women-trafficking in Nepal could
date back to the 50's and the government has enforced the
women-trafficking crime law for more than 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Nepalese girl teenagers and women in their twenties have been
found sold to brothels in Indian cities. even their parents and
close relatives were found active in this illegal activity, police
reports revealed.
</P>
<P>
They were usually cheated and taken to India by traffickers
with false promises that they would be given good jobs or marry
rich men there, but once they were sold into the prostitution
industry with a price of some 20,000 Indian rupees (about 500 US
dollars), their tragedy began.
</P>
<P>
Some Nepalese women went to India to work as prostitutes
voluntarily for earning big money, social workers said.
</P>
<P>
Observers said that the extreme poverty in Nepal's rural areas
and the nearly 900 kilometer open Nepal-India border made
women-trafficking an easy way to make illegal money for
traffickers and desperate rural parents.
</P>
<P>
Working in prostitution exposed these Nepalese women to the
danger of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases. There were
frequent reports in recent years that hiv-positive prostitutes
expelled from Indian brothels came back to Nepal and continued
their services for their countrymen, causing the AIDS panic among
the general public.
</P>
<P>
With a view to controlling the tendency of women-trafficking,
participants of the seminar presented different recommendations
for the government, including introducing rural women's
empowerment programs.
</P>
<P>
Some even suggested that local governments maintain records of
all women between 12 and 35 on the village level to monitor their
whereabouts and take legal action against those who voluntarily
resorted to prostitution.
</P>
<P>
They also called on the authorities of Nepal and India to hold
regular talks to solve the women-trafficking problem.

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Utilization of foreign funds has
been improved in Jinjiang, a coastal city mainly inhabited by
relatives of overseas Chinese in southeast China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
Located to the west of the Taiwan Straits, the city has a
population of 950,000 and its overseas Chinese residents amount to
two million.
</P>
<P>
To cash in on the advantage, the local government has
instituted a series of preferential policies to encourage overseas
investment and made greater efforts to improve its investment
environment.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last September, some 1,940 enterprises funded by
overseas investors had been established in the city, involving a
total investment of 16.692 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The scale of overseas investment has been expanding in recent
years, local officials said. Since 1992, there have been 36 giant
overseas-funded projects, each involving an investment of over 10
million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
During the January-August period last year, the local
government approved 155 foreign-funded enterprises involving a
total contracted investment of 2.286 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the structure of overseas investment is also
improving. Sectors of infrastructure, energy, transportation and
agriculture have become major targets of investors.

<HEADLINE> UASC to Buy 10 Container Ships from Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 22 (Xinhua) -- United Arab Shipping
Co. (UASC) has ordered 10 new container ships worth 660 million
U.S. dollars from a consortium of three Japanese shipyards.
</P>
<P>
Today's local newspaper Gulf News reported that the 10 ships
will be delivered in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Each container ship will carry 3,800 20-foot containers at a
speed of 24 knots, the report quoted UASC President Abdullah al
Mady as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the new ships will replace 13 vessels operating on the
Japan, Far East, Middle East and North Europe lanes. Five of
these are chartered and will be phased out. The rest will be
redeployed in other sectors and for other operations such as
feedering.
</P>
<P>
Last year, UASC formed a panel of three board members and the
chairman to study the fleet expansion. The panel invited bids to
which 14 shipyards responded, and the Japanese consortium of
Kawasaki, Mitsubishi and Mitsui finally won the order.
</P>
<P>
UASC was established on July 1, 1976 with an authorized
capital of 1,77 billion dollars. Its owners are Kuwait, the United
Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The UASC headquarters was shifted to Dubai from Kuwait after
the 1990 Gulf crisis.

<HEADLINE> Over-Counter Stock Market Booming in Wuhan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, January 22 (Xinhua) -- This capital of central China's
Hubei Province is doing a thriving trade in over-the-counter
securities.
</P>
<P>
In 1995 eight stocks were traded over the counter at the Wuhan
Securities Trading Center, with turnover totalled 800 million
yuan. Shares valued at seven or eight million yuan were changed
hands each day, with a record daily turnover of more than 30
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The index in the over-the-counter market shot from the initial
105 points to 192 by the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
"Since we started the experimental over-the-counter market one
year ago we have received warm response from public companies,
securities firms and investors," said Xia Changyi, chief inspector
of the Wuhan Securities Trading Center.
</P>
<P>
As many as 80,000 local residents, along with institutions and
individuals from Hunan, Jiangxi, and Guangdong provinces and
Shanghai, have participated in the trade. Companies from outside
Hubei have applied to be traded on the over-the-counter market.
</P>
<P>
"We have a new trading channel here, and the recently installed
modern facilities have streamlined trading," said an official with
the Hubei Securities Company.
</P>
<P>
The eight public companies traded over the counter have been
under pressure to improve their operations. "The average dividends
of the eight companies have exceeded those for similar companies
listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges," said Xia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile northeast China's Liaoning Province and east China's
Shandong Province are also trying over-the-counter trade.
</P>
<P>
The experiments open channels for the flow of property rights
in companies which have not been listed on stock exchanges,
promoting the establishment of public companies, and upgrading
China's securities market, analysts pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"Over-the-counter trade, as part of the securities market, has
much room to grow in China, as the country is expecting more
public companies," said Xia.

<HEADLINE> Hainan Begins to Produce Chemical Fibers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The first plant to produce
chemical fibers in Hainan Province has become operational in this
provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
Involving 488 million yuan in investment, the plant has an
annual production capacity of 60,000 tons of polyester chips, with
the sales value expected to hit one billion yuan per year.
</P>
<P>
With equipment and technologies imported from the United
States, the plant is expected to increase its annual production
capacity to more than 200,000 tons within a few years.
</P>
<P>
Owing to limited farmland available for planting cotton, the
province will resort to its rich deposits of natural gas to
develop its chemical fiber and textile industries.
</P>
<P>
During the past three years the province has invested a total
of 940 million yuan, including 17 million US dollars in overseas
funds, in textile projects. Its textile products are exported to
Southeast Asia, Japan, Hong Kong, Europe and the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
To make the province one of the country's major chemical fiber
production bases, more efforts will be put into expanding
production scale and upgrading technology, local officials said.

<HEADLINE> Rahim to Resume Post of Malaysia's UMNO Youth Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's former Malacca
chief minister Abdul Rahim Tamby Chik today said he had decided to
resume the post of youth chief of the ruling United Malays
National Organization (UMNO), which he gave up over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Rahim, who claimed that he was a victim of false
allegations, said he made the decision after fully considering all
the aspects.
</P>
<P>
"There are not many leaders who are investigated. I was
investigated from head to toe. I am clean," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rahim, 45, stepped down as UMNO youth chief in September 1994,
about a year after winning the post in 1993, after he was
embroiled in a controversy involving an underage girl. He was also
charged with two counts of corrupt practice.
</P>
<P>
The UMNO supreme council had allowed him to step down
temporarily to enable him to resolve his personal problems.
</P>
<P>
The path for him to resume the post was opened when the
attorney-general found no evidence to involve him in the case.

<HEADLINE> "Tibet's Light, Textile, Handicrafts Industries to Boom" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- China's Tibet Autonomous Region
is expected to see a 15.5 percent average annual growth rate in
its light, textile and handicrafts industries during the 1996-2000
period, with these sectors' total output value hitting 246 million
yuan by the end of this century.
</P>
<P>
Tubdain, deputy director of the region's Textile and
Handicrafts Industries Bureau, said here that these industries'
output value has maintained an average annual increase rate of
17.88 percent during the past five years, much higher than the
country's average.
</P>
<P>
The sector's total output value was 516 million yuan during the
1991-1995 period, with that of the textile industry reaching 127
million yuan, and that of handicrafts 389 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
During the period, the sector's enterprises developed about 500
new products, and revived the technology of copper casting, which
had nearly become a lost art.
</P>
<P>
Tubdain noted that the central government has given continuous
support in finance and resources to the development of the
region's light, textile and handicrafts industry.
</P>
<P>
Light industry in Tibet covers 11 sectors, including carpets,
daily necessities, tourism souvenirs, etc., with 120 major
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Local carpets in special styles have entered the world market
and have a good reputation in the United States, France, Japan and
other countries and regions.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Reaction Mixes on Thai Vice PM's Traffic Efforts (by Yu Zuncheng) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Thai Deputy Prime Minister
Thaksin Shinawatra has received both praise and criticism on his
efforts to improve traffic congestion in the capital during the
last six months.
</P>
<P>
During the campaign for the July 2 general election last year,
Thaksin, a tycoon-turned politician and leader of the Palang
Dharma (virtue force) Party, said that he, if elected and given
the task, would improve Bangkok's traffic in six months' time.
</P>
<P>
His self-imposed deadline falls on January 26.
</P>
<P>
Of 1,480 responses to a poll conducted by the Bangkok Post
between January 10-17, 57.5 percent felt there had been a general
improvement, while 41.9 percent saw none.
</P>
<P>
Only 20 percent of them were satisfied with the degree of
improvement, 65.2 percent were not, and 14.8 percent offered no
comment.
</P>
<P>
During the last six months, the measures Thaksin proposed or
introduced include introduction of the magnetic toll cards system,
 centerized computer traffic control system, a reward fund from
his own pocket for traffic police, and erection of signboards
urging motorists to obey traffic rules and discouragement of new
car purchases.
</P>
<P>
Traffic experts also differ over the success of Thaksin's
six-month drive to end traffic congestion, with some claiming it
failed, while others saying he lacked time to do all he wanted.
</P>
<P>
Viroj Rujopakarn, a traffic expert of Kasetsart University,
said the overall traffic situation was unchanged, although there
were more cars on the road every day.
</P>
<P>
An average of 700 new cars and 500 new motorcycles come on to
the road in Bangkok each day.
</P>
<P>
Viroj sees no quick fix and claims that congestion cannot be
solved in a few years' time until major mass transit projects are
completed.
</P>
<P>
"The situation will remain as bad as it is for at least two or
three years," he said.
</P>
<P>
People expected too much from Thaksin's promise. "No one can
ever do that (solving the congestion problems)," Viroj said.
</P>
<P>
Viroj believes that Thaksin would have to ban many things to
meet his target and the public would never have accepted this.
</P>
<P>
One reader said in a letter to the Bangkok Post , "Rome was not
built in a day. So Bangkok's chronic traffic cannot be solved in
six months."
</P>
<P>
He adds, "Mr. Thaksin has the guts and determination to make it
work; other politicians are only good at talking."
</P>
<P>
On a more negative note, another letter said, "Mr. Thaksin's
promise was just a cynical ploy to get votes. Anyone with common
sense would know what he promised could not be done in six
months."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the deadline, Thaksin said that his short-term
steps had improved traffic flow and driver discipline, his
medium-term measures (installation of computerized traffic lights)
at 146 intersections in the city would bear fruit in four months,
while his long-term plans are the underground train system and an
elevated train system now being built.
</P>
<P>
He said that he is ready to press on with his work, if the
public lets him.

<HEADLINE> Africa Facing A Difficult Year Ahead, Says FAO Boss </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Foods and
Agriculture Organisation (FAO) is alert to Africa's food supply.
</P>
<P>
FAO's Director-General Dr Jacques Diouf says in a report that
there are low food stocks in the major donor countries.
</P>
<P>
Jacques Diouf who visited Zimbabwe, Zambia and Kenya recently,
says food aid allocations to sub-Saharan Africa have dropped as
world cereal supplies tightened, adding that last year, food aid
shipments reduced to the lowest levels ever in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
He says sub-Saharan Africa's food aid in the 1994-95 period
dropped to 70 percent of the average for the previous five years.
</P>
<P>
In the report, the FAO boss predicts further production
decline this year and says many of the 44 low income food deficit
countries in Africa will be hard pressed to import food.
</P>
<P>
However, Diouf's report says, despite the low food supply,
food assistance is still urgently needed to avert a crisis in
several eastern Africa countries.
</P>
<P>
It cites Eritrea, Sudan and Ethiopia as some of the countries
which may require emergency food supplies.

<HEADLINE> "Chinese Economy Stable in December" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese economy proceeded
along a stable and healthy path, with industrial production
picking up momentum and inflation easing further, according to a
report released today by the State Statistics Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The report said that China achieved 186.9 billion yuan-worth of
industrial output value last month, up 14.9 percent over the same
period of 1994, adding that the rate was 2.8 percentage points
higher than that for the previous month.
</P>
<P>
It said, "Industry's sales rate against production rose
substantially to 102.5 percent last month, a record for 1995."
</P>
<P>
China sold 239 billion yuan-worth of goods on the retail
markets last month, up 12.4 percent over the same month of 1994,
the report said, adding that the retail sales volume in the urban
areas grew 14.4 percent last month, while that in the rural areas
increased by 9.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report said that China's banks and rural credit
associations received 80.6 billion yuan in deposits, 44.2 billion
yuan more than in December 1994, while they issued 191.7 billion
yuan in loans last month, 82.9 billion yuan more than in December
1994.
</P>
<P>
China's inflation rate was further brought down last month,
with the consumer price index and retail sales price indices
edging up 10.1 percent and 8.3 percent last month compared to
December 1994, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The State Statistics Bureau pointed out that the major ailment
in China's economic situation last year was the drop in the
efficiency of industry.
</P>
<P>
The composite index for industrial economic efficiency during
the January-November period last year was 88.76, some 3.19
percentage points down from the same period in 1994, the report
said, adding that in the same period 23.4 percent of the Chinese
industrial enterprises were running at a loss, and the rate was
1.4 percentage points higher than in the same period of 1994.

BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Shanxi Province in north China
achieved a rapid growth in its telecommunications industry during
the country's Eighth Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995), with the
output value reaching 60 million yuan last year.

<HEADLINE> China Expands Foreign Oil, Gas Co-operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- China will open more new areas
rich in oil and gas resources to foreign petroleum companies, and
plans to use two billion US dollars of overseas investment in this
field in the coming five years.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhou Yongkang, deputy general manager of the China
National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), these areas will include
western China, the Songliao Plain in northeast China and Bohai Bay
as well as places around the existing oilfields in east China.
</P>
<P>
"These areas with long-range and intact reserves are attractive
to foreign investors," Zhou noted.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that Sino-foreign co-operation in prospecting for
oil and natural gas resources has expanded to 21 provinces and
regions across the country, covering 2.499 million sq km.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, China has already concluded 15
contracts for oil and natural gas prospecting with foreign
companies on a total area of 150,000 sq km, involving 486 million
US dollars.
</P>
<P>
"While drawing the attention of foreign companies to jointly
prospect oil and gas resources," he said, "China is striving to
enter foreign oil- and gas-prospecting markets to share the
world's resources."
</P>
<P>
Zhou disclosed that China will focus on the Middle East, Russia
and Central Asia in the coming five years while seeking
opportunities to carefully undertake transnational business in oil
and gas prospecting in other places.
</P>
<P>
The country is expected to form an annual production capacity
of five million to 10 million tons of crude oil outside China by
the end of this century, and between 15 million and 20 million
tons by the year 2010.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) today
congratulated Yasser Arafat on his victory in Saturday's
elections, saying the result is instrumental to the Mideast peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Italy, now taking over the rotating EU presidency, said in a
foreign ministry statement that the result showed the Palestinian
people's commitment to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
EU will continue to bolster the peace process economically and
politically for a comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle
East, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
In another development, French President Jacques Chirac, in a
letter to Arafat today, also congratulated the latter on his
victory and pledged to support the Palestinian people in their
struggle for the recognition of their legitimate rights, said
reports from Paris.
</P>
<P>
Arafat won 88.1 percent of the Saturday vote, becoming the
first democratically elected leader of the Palestinian people
after almost 30 years of struggle for a homeland.
</P>
<P>
The turnout was high among the one million eligible voters,
which was widely believed as an endorsement of the PLO leader's
1993 peace agreement with Israel which made polls possible.

<HEADLINE> Central Bank to Continue Tight-Money Policy (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Speaking of the financial reform, Dai said China will reform
the interest administration system in line with the increasing
market rates in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
This year the interest rates for inter-bank lending and
borrowing will be decided by the capital demand in the
market. Financial institutions can decide their interest rates for
loans in accordance with the different credit, time periods and
risk rating of customers.
</P>
<P>
The central bank will also accelerate the reform of the
administration structure in credit co-operatives in rural areas
this year. The credit co-operatives can decide the amounts of
their loans after they have turned over the reserves required. One
to two rural co-operative banks may be set up in the relatively
developed counties or cities in each province. Urban co-operative
banks will be set up in 35 cities by the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
The central bank governor said China will also continue its
reform of the foreign exchange structure and complete the current
foreign exchange surrender system by which domestic enterprises
are obliged to sell all of their foreign exchange earnings to the
central bank and step up the process of making the renminbi
convertible under current accounts.
</P>
<P>
Dai said China will introduce foreign-funded financial
institutions in a planned way and expand their business scopes
after a certain period of experimentation. The state-owned
commercial banks and other domestic financial institutions are
encouraged to set up branches overseas to expand their business.

<HEADLINE> Central Bank to Continue Tight-Money Policy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- China will continue its
stringent monetary policy in the upcoming five years as the
country vows to keep its growth rate of money supply lower than
the expected economic growth and inflation rates, said Dai
Xianglong, governor of the People's Bank of China here yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Dai said China saw a larger increase in the supply of narrow
money (M1), which means currency in circulation plus demands for
deposits of enterprises, in the three years from 1992 to 1994 than
the economic growth rate and price hikes, which resulted in
serious inflation.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, he said, China will limit the increase in the supply
of narrow money to 18 percent, and the supply of broad money (M2),
which means cash plus all kinds of deposits, to 25 percent, an
increase 4.5 percentage points below the 1995 rate. Secondly,
China will ensure the decision-making powers of financial
institutions to improve the loan quality. Thirdly, the country
will try to limit price rises to around ten percent. Fourthly, the
central bank will make better use of interest rates, reserve rates
and publicized market business to adjust the money supply.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the tight money supply complaints by enterprises, he
said, China issued 60 billion yuan in local currency last year, a
figure much lower than that of the previous year. However, he
said, it doesn't mean the policy was too tight as last year's
money supply increase was built up on the large supply from 1992
to 1994.
</P>
<P>
Last year China's financial institutions increased their loans
by 934 billion yuan, an increase of 23 percent. The supply of
broad money grew by 29.5 percent in 1995, but the price increase
of retail sales was maintained at 14.8 percent. This meant that
the general money supply was still too large.
</P>
<P>
To ensure a correct monetary policy and strong financial
supervision and administration, the central bank will complete its
financial regulations and supervise and administer market
entrance, business scopes and financial risks to maintain a stable
and lawful operation of financial institutions.

TOKYO, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Two moderate earthquakes,
including one with a magnitude of 5.5, jolted Japan's northernmost
main island of Hokkaido Monday, and two separate tremors rocked
western Japan.
</P>
<P>
Police said there were no immediate reports of damage or injuries
from any of the tremors.
</P>
<P>
The 5.5-magnitude earthquake was centered at a depth of about

islands off Northern Japan, the Japanese Central Meteorological
Agency said.
</P>
<P>
That tremor occurred at 9:11 a.m. (local time).
</P>
<P>
About six hours earlier, a separate and unrelated earthquake

<HEADLINE> Chinese Garment Enterprises Pursue Brand-Name Strategy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The China National Textile
Council is encouraging garment manufacturers to make their brand
names better known worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Dong Binggen, general manager of the China National Garment
Corporation, noted that China's garment industry has "basically
attained the capability to both manufacture high-quality products
and establish famous brands." He noted that China's garment sector
has made a remarkable transformation from being a handicraft
industry to being a modern labor-intensive through the
skyrocketing growth of the industry over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
So far, the country boasts an annual production capacity of 8.5
billion garments, while sales of foreign garment brands register a
117 percent increase every year.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that an ambitious strategy scheduled to be
launched during the country's Ninth Five-Year Plan period
(1996-2000), could start with the suit and shirts sectors, which
already have a number of well-known brands, including Youngor,
Wild Wind, Pine and Conch Shell, on the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
The east China-based Youngor Group, one of China's biggest
shirt makers, will inaugurate an investment program this year
involving 100 million yuan, to import advanced garment production
lines from Japan, Germany and Italy, as well as hire foreign
experts to participate in the group's CI (corporate image) design,
said the company's president, Li Rucheng.
</P>
<P>
Another leader in China's shirt sector, the Conch Shell Company
of Shanghai will establish a top-grade garment group during the
next five years, so as to further promote sales of its Conch Shell
brand shirts on both home and overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
Dai Ziyi, president of the company, said that the company's
sales network has extended to 28 provinces, municipalities and
autonomous regions in China, and it receives orders from more than
50 countries and regions. By the year 2000 it will have developed
into a world-class garment enterprise with a sales volume of one
billion yuan-worth, and foreign currency earnings of 50 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Zheng Yonggang, chairman of the Pine Group, a suit-making giant
in Ningbo City, Zhejiang Province, said that the domestic market
for high-grade suits is suffering from competition posed by
foreign brands, in contrast to the prosperous shirt business. So
it is more urgent for China's suit enterprises to promote their
brands.
</P>
<P>
As the first step in the "Quality Brand" strategy, the group
employed a Japanese suit designer at an annual salary of 1.5
million yuan in 1995, and will hire three Italian experts to take
charge of its suit workshops this year.
</P>
<P>
Also, the presidents of the Shou Wang Group, the country's
largest leather garment plant, and the Wild Wind Group, a newcomer
to the domestic shirt sector, have called for a further expansion
of the production scale of Chinese garment enterprises this month,
as well as the adoption of modern management models, including the
CI concept, in order to survive the increasingly rigorous
challenge from overseas competitors.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, garment experts here have pointed out that there are
already 32 enterprises registering sales of 100 million yuan each
last year. Their combined turnover of profits and taxes accounts
for 13 percent of that of the whole of the industry. The maturity
of such garment giants will play an important role in the
competition with powerful foreign garment companies.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of 1996 the country's 14 biggest garment
plants will jointly organize a corporation to develop leading
brands. The new corporation will open shops throughout the
country, so as to introduce more Chinese garment brands to
domestic customers.

DHAKA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is facing difficulty
in distributing free primary school textbooks in the next few
years as donors have signaled discontinuation of funding, a top
ranking official of the Education Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, representatives of the donor
agencies recently asked the Bangladeshi government to become self

</P>
<P>
The government started the free-book project in 1988 in a bid
to cut drop-out rates at the primary level and enhance the
literacy rate in the country.
</P>
<P>
"This is a huge task involving around one billion taka (about
25 million US dollars), of which 70 to 80 percent is coming from
donor bodies," said the official.
</P>
<P>
The major donor bodies are from Norway, Canada and the United
Nations. The World Bank is also contributing significantly.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government will seek to continue the free-book
project in primary schools if the donors finally withdraw their
contributions, the official assured.

<HEADLINE> Poland Suffers Huge Loss Because of Organized Crimes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Poland suffered a loss of more
than 1 billion U.S. dollars caused by up to 97.05 million criminal
cases in 1995, according to a symposium on organized crimes in
Poland.
</P>
<P>
Crimes such as drug trafficking, smuggling of weapons, forgery
of documents, robberies and murders ran rampant in the country in
1995 and most took place in big cities and border areas.
</P>
<P>
Some 14 people were killed and 23 others seriously injured in a
total of 120 terrorist bombings last year while 400 armed
criminals from 13 countries were seized by Polish police.
</P>
<P>
Experts, who came from various parts of the country to attend
the symposium, pointed out that it was not enough just to fight
against crimes since the government had taken a series of
effective measures.
</P>
<P>
They said the state must perfect its laws to make the
anti-crime struggle more effective, finance and modernize the
organs that bring criminals to justice, and strengthen
international cooperation in this field.

<HEADLINE> Barge Spills More Oil into Atlantic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- A barge that ran aground the
U.S. east coast spilled another 100,000 gallons of heating oil
into the Atlantic today, as crew began pumping oil from the ship.
</P>
<P>
Reports from South Kingstown, Rhode Island, said the barge,
carrying 4 million gallons of heating oil, leaked about 828,000
gallons of its cargo after it ran aground on Nebraska Shoals,
Rhode Island, Friday during a storm.
</P>
<P>
The spill, pushed out to sea by the wind, was still spreading
from the southern coast of Rhode Island to the Connecticut border
in the north. Birds were seen covered with oil and fishing was
banned in a 105 square-mile area along the coast.
</P>
<P>
An Associated Press report said thousands of lobsters and
several dozen birds, mostly ducks, were killed along the coast
near the Trustom Pond National Wildlife Refuge.
</P>
<P>
Three skimming boats were at the scene removing oil from the
water's surface. The Coast Guard, who first spotted the leaking
Friday, has set up booms around the barge and other coastal salt
ponds to keep the oil from spreading.
</P>
<P>
Eklof Marine, the company that owns the barge, said it hired
workers and 10 vessels to help with the cleanup.
</P>
<P>
Crews estimated it would take at least 14 hours to pump out
about 1 million gallons in order to set the barge afloat again.
</P>
<P>
Rhode Island Governor Lincoln Almond declared an emergency and
requested federal disaster relief funds to help pay for the
cleanup of the worst oil spill in the history of the state.
</P>
<P>
Home heating oil is lighter and much easier to evaporate than
crude oil. An expert estimated that 600,000 gallons of the oil
probably evaporated or dissipated in the water.

<HEADLINE> Spanish Opposition Set to Win March Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Spain's largest opposition group,
the Popular Party (PP), ended a three-day conference here today
convinced that it will win the general elections set for March 3.
</P>
<P>
The Party's national executive today confirmed Jose Maria Aznar
as its leader in the hope that he will become the first candidate
to end Socialist Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez's 14-year grip on
power.
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls show that the PP is seven to 10 percentage points
ahead of Gonzalez's Socialist Workers' Party, who has been in
power since 1982.
</P>
<P>
"A great responsibility awaits us," Aznar told a cheering
crowd. "We are ready. We are going to win."
</P>
<P>
The 42-year-old former tax inspector, making a speech at the
meeting in the Juan Carlos I convention center, vowed to take
power after years of Socialist rule.
</P>
<P>
The PP has a membership of more than 300,000.
</P>
<P>
To dispel reservations about voting for the right among many
Spaniards who lived through the dictatorship of Francisco Franco
(1939-75), the PP continuously brought home the party's election
slogan, "Let the center win."
</P>
<P>
The PP, repeatedly using the word "center," also announced
after the conference that it has become a center party, no more a
right-wing or a mildly right-wing one.
</P>
<P>
The PP proposed a mixture of economic austerity and
liberalization, cutting budget deficit and taxes, reducing
unemployment and streamlining the public sector.
</P>
<P>
The opposition has advanced considerably since 1993 -- it now
controls 10 of Spain's 17 regional governments and leads over
Gonzalez's Socialists in opinion polls.

BONN, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Police from Luebeck said today
they have arrested a suspect for setting a fire to a building for
asylum seekers that killed 10 immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The suspect, a 20-year-old Lebanese, was slightly injured in

</P>
<P>
The Lebanese, whose identification was not given, lived in the
building together with about 50 other asylum seekers mainly from
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Police ruled out the possibility that the fire could have
started from outside and according to the police, the Lebanese
youth had told a fire fighter that it was he who set the fire.
</P>
<P>
The motive for setting the building ablaze was not known,
the police said. But the suspect denied the charges during the
interrogation.
</P>
<P>
The blaze in Luebeck, a Baltic seaport city in Germany, which
killed six children and four adults and injuried 40 last Thursday,

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Reintroduce Incentives for Engine Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January (22 (Xinhua) -- The Board of Investment (BOI)
of the Thai government will soon reintroduce incentives for the
manufacture of diesel engines for one-ton pickup trucks and
four-stroke engines for motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
The move is aimed at fostering competition and turning Thailand
into an automobile manufacturing center of Southeast Asia,
according to the BOI Deputy Secretary-General Chakramon
Phasukvanich.
</P>
<P>
The move also precedes the abolition of local content
requirements in production, to comply with World Trade
Organization regulations, within four and a half years.
</P>
<P>
The 70 percent local content requirement for diesel and
four-stroke motorcycle engine production will be reduced to a
level to be determined.
</P>
<P>
Details on the reintroduction of incentives will be discussed
next month.
</P>
<P>
Privileges for diesel engine manufacturers had been suspended
to protect ventures which are trying to reduce engine production
costs by sharing the manufacturing process.
</P>
<P>
The BOI will also grant new incentives for the manufacture of
four-stroke engines in rural and remote provinces, known as Zone
Three.
</P>
<P>
New incentives for four-stroke engine production is expected to
help increase production of four-stroke motorcycles, which are
more environmentally friendly than those with two-stroke engines.
</P>
<P>
The Industry Ministry will also lift a ban on the opening of
motorcycle engine factories.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the BOI tried to encourage production of four-stroke
engines, particularly in Zone Three, by offering a 75 percent cut
in duty on raw material imports. But investors wanted all import
duty waived as imported materials accounted for most of the cost
of motorcycles assembly.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thailand's auto-parts manufacturers recently decided
that their industry should be placed on the fast track for import
tariff cuts to 0-5 percent by 2003.

<HEADLINE> World Bank to Provide 400 million U.S. dollars to Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has decided to
provide two loans totaling 400 million U.S. dollars to Romania to
help improve its financial market and railway transportation
facilities.
</P>
<P>
Of the loans, 280 million dollars will be used for financial
institutions and privatization programs. The rest will be used for
revitalizing Romania's railway transportation industry.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank loans are payable in 20 years with a grace
period of five years.
</P>
<P>
Sweden also provided a loan of 6.9 million dollars in
mid-January.
</P>
<P>
The fund from the World Bank and Sweden are expected to help
ease Romania's foreign trade deficit, which stood at 1.5 billion
dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The trade deficit has brought about negative effect on
Romania's financial market, forcing the country's currency, the
lie, to fall from 2550 against the dollar in early January to 2599
on January 20. On the market, the lie actually fell to 3200
against the dollar.
</P>
<P>
Romania had a foreign reserve of 600-700 million dollars by the
end of last year far short of the targeted 1 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Mugur Isarescu, director of Romania's National Central Bank,
attributed the gap to the trade deficit and said his country plans
to issue international bonds in Europe, North America and Japan.

BANGKOK, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) asked Vietnam to set aside an emergency rice
stock of 14,000 tons under a commitment to the group, a report
reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN Food Security Board urged the Vietnamese government
to approve the ASEAN's food security agreement, under which a

if a shortage emerges in others.
</P>
<P>
The board asked Vietnam to stock 13,000-15,000 tons of rice at
a meeting last week in Chiang Mai in northern Thailand as the
country ranks second to Thailand as a rice exporter.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese delegation agreed to stock 14,000 tons of rice,
subject to the government's approval.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's stock is 15,000 tons, Indonesia's is 13,000 tons,
Malaysia 12,000 tons, the Philippines 7,000 tons, and others less.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam. Vietnam joined the group in July
last year.

<HEADLINE> Housing Finances Ease in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The housing industry in
Australia has remained stagnant as the volume of housing finance
dipped 1.4 percent in November last year.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported today that the
number of houses loaned stood at 38,627 units in seasonally
adjusted terms in November, down from 39,178 units in October.
</P>
<P>
The 1.4 percent fall in November followed a remarkable increase
in the previous month, when the housing finance was up 6.3
percent.
</P>
<P>
The October figure was previously reported at an increase of 3
percent, but was revised up to 6.3 percent last week.
</P>
<P>
In value, however, the housing finance rose to 3.747 billion
Australian dollars (2.773 billion US dollars) in November from
3.731 billion Australian dollars (2.761 billion US dollars) in
October.
</P>
<P>
Australia's building industry has been declining since it hit
its peak in mid-1994 and local economists predicted that the
housing industry would not pick up until the mid-1996.

<HEADLINE> Private Buyers of Motor Vehicles Rising in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- China will strive to produce
1.3 million sedans and 1.4 million buses and trucks by the turn of
this century, today's "China Daily" quoted He Guangyuan, minister
of the machine-building industry as saying.
</P>
<P>
He Guangyuan made the remarks at a two-day automotive industry
annual work conference ended here yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Buying of motor vehicles for private use is rising in China and
has already dominating the market, noted He.
</P>
<P>
China produced 11.58 million motor vehicles last year, up 42
percent over 1994. At least 82 percent were bought for private use.
</P>
<P>
Of the motor vehicles produced last year, 2.3 million were
simple and cheap and called "farming vehicles".
</P>
<P>
Last year's production also included 7.83 million motorcycles,
and 1.45 million sedans, buses and trucks.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that in the near future modern sedans and other
better motor vehicles will replace the present "farming vehicles".
</P>
<P>
Industry executives and experts have appealed to the government
to reduce taxes ad fees levied on car buyers and to help foster a
big market for motor vehicles. enditem

<HEADLINE> Guangxi Attracts More Foreign Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANNING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous
Region has made great progress in using foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the multi-ethnic region in southern
China has used 3.2 billion US dollars of foreign investment over
the past five years, accounting for 20 percent of the region's
total investment.
</P>
<P>
Guangxi has approved 5,600 foreign-funded projects during this
period, a tenfold increase over the 1986-1990 period, and exported
goods valued at 800 million US dollars, up 150 times.
</P>
<P>
A regional official said that the average per project
investment rose from 1.034 million US dollars in 1991 to 1.75
million US dollars last year, and foreign investment is expanding
to the region's poverty-stricken central and western areas.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the number of countries investing in the region
has expanded from 11 at the end of 1990 to 48.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Traffic Pressure Eased After Price Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- As the traditional Chinese
Spring Festival approaches, there are fewer people waiting outside
booking offices and the subway is no longer crowded in the
capital, but the airport lounge has started to swarm with
passengers, in sharp contrast to the scene a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Since last October people have had to pay an average 51.8
percent more to take trains nationwide while Beijing residents pay
three times more to take the subway.
</P>
<P>
Liu Gang, a garment businessman who often travels by train from
the capital to Guangzhou in south China, said, "Nowadays I find it
much easier to buy tickets, as fewer people are taking trains."
</P>
<P>
According to the railway departments, when the price hike took
effective last October the number of train passengers immediately
dropped by 11 percent, thinning out ticket queues and easing the
overloading of trains.
</P>
<P>
However, although China has 1,088 pairs of trains running each
day there are still some 700,000 more passengers than seats. Thus,
an increasing number of people are taking planes instead of trains.
</P>
<P>
"After the price hike I started to fly on business trips. The
soft sleeper on the train between Beijing and Shanghai costs 519
yuan (about 61.8 US dollars), while the plane only costs 550 yuan,
and of course is much quicker," said Lin Kai, a salesman for a
state-owned company in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Sources said that some units and companies which used to bar
employees from taking planes at public expense have now lifted the
ban.
</P>
<P>
Some airlines saw the number of passengers shoot up by 10 to 20
percent last November and December, the traditional slack season
for air travel.
</P>
<P>
The Capital International Airport handled more than 1.34
million passengers last November.
</P>
<P>
Following the train price hike, buses and the subway in the
capital also increased their fares at the beginning of this
year. The 4,400 buses in the city carry 8.5 million people each
day while 140 subway trains handle a daily 1.46 million passengers.
</P>
<P>
Although the price hike has relieved the financial burden on
Beijing's public transport to some extent, the city still needs to
subsidize it to the tune of 1.65 billion yuan (about 196.4 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the municipal government's transportation
department, said, "The local bus and subway fares are among the
cheapest in China, indeed in the world as a whole. So the price
hikes are very natural."
</P>
<P>
Now people are no longer packed like sardines in the subway; in
the first week of the new year there were 1.18 million passengers
per day, 300,000 less than in the past. But some local residents
still feel the price hike is somewhat high, as the subway fare has
been increased from 0.5 yuan to two yuan, and the monthly ticket
from 18 yuan to 40 yuan.
</P>
<P>
However, it is predicted that the price hikes will not dampen
people's enthusiasm for travelling for family reunions during the
Spring Festival season, which is traditionally the annual
transport peak.
</P>
<P>
Railway experts predict there will be some 143 million people
travelling by train during the holidays, a rise of 1.3 percent
over the same period of last year. The Beijing Railway Station
alone will handle 360,000 passengers per day.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey shows that taxis and mini buses have become
even more popular in Beijing following the price hike. And the
number of people riding bicycles is on the rise.

The Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>
-- The 1996 federal election campaign and poll are expected to

time.
</P>

race to become the first Australian bank with a fully operational
banking capability on the Internet and may have its first

The Sydney Morning Herald

parties in the Federal election.

<P>
-- The 200 dolphins living off Portsea and Sorrento in coastal

<HEADLINE> Republican Conditions US Debt Ceiling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. House of
Representatives Majority Leader Richard Armey said on Sunday the
House would refuse to raise the U.S. debt ceiling unless President
Bill Clinton agrees to a substantial share of the Republican
Agenda.
</P>
<P>
But Armey said Congress would not shut down the government
again in its budget standoff with the president when a new
deadline comes on Friday. He said Congress would approve a bill to
keep the government running, probably another 30 days.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on NBC's "Meet the Press", Armey said that a debt
ceiling bill "is not coming through the House unless it carries
with it something that is a substantial share of our agenda of
decreasing the size and intrusiveness of government."
</P>
<P>
White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta said later on the
program that he was disturbed Armey had said the debt ceiling
increase would be held hostage to the budget dispute between
Clinton and the Republican controlled Congress.
</P>
<P>
"Let's not play games with the future of this country or the
economy of this country," he said.

<HEADLINE> UK, France to Build New Version of Concorde </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- A new version of Concorde is
being developed as manufacturers realized the increasing costs of
operating the world's fastest commercial jet will one day exceed
the profits it makes, according to a Sunday Times report.
</P>
<P>
The new version, Concorde Two, will carry 300 passengers, have
a range of more than 6,500 miles and travel at two and a half
times the speed of sound. Its older relation has 100 seats, can
manage only 4,000 miles and is 25 per cent slower.
</P>
<P>
Under the new design, Concorde Two will have a cockpit at the
rear of the plane close to the tailfin, which will spell an end
for Concorde's's distinctive drooping nose.
</P>
<P>
Also being designed are new engines to cope with increasingly
strict European laws on aircraft pollution. At low altitudes they
will consume less air and therefore produce less noise, according
to the report.
</P>
<P>
At present, Concorde registers 120 decibels on take-off, louder
than a rock concert.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that with an increased range, the new generation
will have a wider market. Flights from London to Los Angeles and
Tokyo are important sources of revenue, but are beyond Concorde's
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
The new generation will be able to reach such longhaul
destinations without refueling.

<HEADLINE> Flooding, Snow Claim 35 Deaths in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The past week's burst of
flooding, snow, ice and cold in the northern and eastern region of
the United States had caused at least 35 deaths, according to
local press reports.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, post-snow flooding forced hundreds of people from
their homes along the Ohio River and residents of flooded
towns upstream in Pennsylvania and upstate New York scraped mud
from soaked homes and businesses.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton declared on Sunday Pennsylvania a
disaster area because of the flooding.
</P>
<P>
The Ohio River crested Sunday at several spots along West
Virginia's Northern Panhandle.
</P>
<P>
The low-lying Wheeling Island was 95 percent under water as the
Ohio rose 10 feet out of its banks, damaging every home of the
3,500 residents and forcing some 700 people to flee the island.
</P>
<P>
The Ohio was three feet above flood level Sunday at
Parkersburg, West Virginia and it was expected to rise an
additional three feet.
</P>
<P>
Flood gates were closed in levees protecting Parkersburg,
Huntington and other cities along the river. About 1,000 people
had been evacuated in eastern Ohio's Jefferson County.
</P>
<P>
Several bridges and roads were closed in Harrisburg in central
Pennsylvania.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Elected President of Palestinian Council (By Xie Dongfeng and Wang Yukui) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RAMALLAH, WEST BANK, January 21 (Xinhua) -- PLO Chairman
Yasser Arafat has been formally elected President of the
Palestinian Council (PC) after a landslide victory in the first
Palestinian elections.
</P>
<P>
This was announced here tonight by Mohammad Shtayyeh, general
secretary of the Palestinian Central Election Commission (CEC).
</P>
<P>
Arafat won 88.1 percent of the votes, while his sole
challenger Samiha Khalil, a little known social worker, got the
support of 9.3 percent votes. Some 2.6 percent of the votes are
void or blank.
</P>
<P>
Shtayyeh added that the counts do not include the votes in
east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The CEC said that some 85 percent of the 1.04 million
registered eligible voters took part in the elections in 1697
voting stations of 16 districts throughout the Gaza Strip and the
West Bank, including east Jerusalem. Five percent of the votes
were void or blank eventually.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's victory is no surprise by any means because of his
irreplaceable position of leadership among the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, after he cast his votes, Arafat said that today's
event marks "the beginning of a new era" and "a foundation of a
Palestinian state."
</P>
<P>
The first Palestinian elections came less than one month after
Israeli troops withdrew from six major West Bank towns and 20
months after Gaza and Jericho gained autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the PC presidency race, the voters are also
electing 88 PC members from 672 candidates.
</P>
<P>
The Fatah candidates are leading in the elections. Although
Hamas and other rejectionist groups boycott the elections, some
Hamas members are running as independent candidates.
</P>
<P>
The final results of the PC elections will be known later
today.

<HEADLINE> Refugee Camp Huts Reportedly Burnt in Burundi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Burundi's army burned huts in
a refugee camp today after thousands of Rwandan hutus living
there abandoned them and fled toward Tanzania, a report from the
Burundi capital of Bujumbura said.
</P>
<P>
Burundi troops were also burning the homes of the few hundred
refugees who chose to stay in Ntamba camp, an official of the
international Red Cross was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Most of the camp's 18,000 population fled on last night and
were massed at the nearby border area with Tanzania today, hoping
to be allowed in.
</P>
<P>
"Houses and the remains of refugee homes were being burned
out. This is a message that refugees will not be allowed back,"
Hitoshi Mise, Burundi representative of the UN High Commissioner
for Refugees (unhcr), said.
</P>
<P>
The arson report provided the idea that Burundi's
Tutsi-dominated army is trying to reduce the number of Hutu
refugees in the country.
</P>
<P>
The unhcr said earlier that almost 16,000 residents of Ntamba
camp fled overnight to the border and about 400 were able to
cross.
</P>
<P>
They fled because they feared the army would attack their camp
as it had done to the neighboring Mugano camp last week, killing
20 Rwandan Hutu refugees and wounding many more.
</P>
<P>
as a result, about 14,000 of the Mugano refugees had crossed
the border by the weekend although Tanzania opposed their arrival
saying they could not stay for long.
</P>
<P>
Speaking earlier today, Mise said the unhcr is talking with
Burundi authorities asking them to send a mission to the border
to try to bring the Ntamba refugees back.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Jean Bikomagu, the Burundi army's chief of staff,
visited camps in the northeast on January 4 and told refugees
Burundi's policy was that they should go home voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
Tutsi militants demonstrated in the capital of Bujumbura on
January 16, demanding president Sylvestre Ntibantunganya, a Hutu
step down from office.
</P>
<P>
They accused him of being behind massacres of Tutsis following
the killing of Burundi's first freely-elected Hutu president in
1993 in a aborted coup by Tutsi troops.

-- Deep in the shadows of this year's presidential campaign,
Republicans and Democrats across the country are beginning to wage
another bruising political battle, one that could determine
whether voters give the green light -- or red flag -- to the
Republican's brash drive to roll back the size and scope of
government.

-- First Bank's 10-billion-dollar merger pact with First
Interstate is looking uncertain, many observers say. They cite
Wells Fargo's high offer, now valued at 11 billion dollars, as
well as the latest setback: an SEC ruling against a share-buyback
strategy that plays a key role in First Bank' agreement.

<HEADLINE> Mandela Meets Buthelezi Over Zulu Gathering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 22 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's Inkatha
Freedom Party (IFP) leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi today conferred
favour on a gathering of the Zulu nation (Imbizo) following talks
with President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference in Pretoria after the talks, both
Mandela and Buthelezi said there was agreement on the procedures
to be followed in arranging the Imbizo, which is aimed at
stamping out violence in the Kwazulu/Natal Province.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that political violence between supporters of
the African National Congress (ANC) and the IFP in KwaZulu/Natal
has claimed more than 14,000 lives in the past few years.
Kwazulu/Natal is the heartland of the Zulu-based IFP.
</P>
<P>
However, Buthelezi said traditional customs to arrange such an
Imbizo had to be observed.
</P>
<P>
The Imbizo would entail a preliminary meeting of Zulu chiefs
(Amakhozi), which would be attended by Mandela, Buthelezi and
Zulu King Goodwill Zwelithini.
</P>
<P>
Plans to stage an Imbizo were announced on January 19
following a meeting between Mandela and Zulu King Goodwill
Zwelithini at the king's palace near Nongoma.
</P>
<P>
The Imbizo was first proposed by Zwelithini during a meeting
with Mandela in 1994, and subsequently supported by Buthelezi.
</P>
<P>
However, the IFP leader later dismissed the Imbizo plan as a
"political ploy" engineered by the ANC and the king. That's why
Buthelezi called his own Imbizo in Durban late last year in a
move that angered the king and strained relations between the two
Zulu leaders.

<HEADLINE> Fatah Candidates Win Most of Palestinian Council Seats (By Xie Dongfeng and Wang Yukui) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jerusalem, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Candidates from the Fatah
movement, the PLO's mainstream faction, have won 50 out of the
total of 88 seats in the Palestinian Council (PC), while
independent candidates have garnered 36 seats.
</P>
<P>
This result was released at a press conference in the West Bank
town of Ramallah by the Palestinian Central Election Commission
(CEC).
</P>
<P>
Gabi Baramki, member of the CEC, said that the results
are provisional because a small portion of the votes have
not been counted. Nevertheless, it is certain that the list
of the 88 PC members will not be changed any more.
</P>
<P>
Of the 88 seats, six were for Christians, including one from
Nablus representing the Samaritan minority.
</P>
<P>
The voting took place on Saturday. PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat
has already been elected President of the PC. He won 88.1 percent
of the votes.
</P>
<P>
The distribution of the PC seats are: Fatah, 50; Independents,
36; FIDA, a breakaway faction from the Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, 1; National Democratic Coalition (NDC),
1.
</P>
<P>
Among the 36 independents, 17 are Fatah members or
Fatah-Affiliated, four are Islamists (three of them
Hamas-affiliated), and one is a member of the Popular Front for
the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP).
</P>
<P>
The results show that Fatah candidates dominated in the
polling throughout the Gaza Strip and the West Bank including
east Jerusalem with the exception of Bethlehem, Ramallah and Tubas.
</P>
<P>
In Bethlehem, all of the four seats have gong to independents,
two of whom are Fatah-affiliated. In Ramallah, five out of the
seven seats have been netted by non-Fatah candidates, including
four Fatah-affiliated independents. In Tubas, Mayor Hashem
El-Saleh, an independent, has obtained the only seat.
</P>
<P>
All the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) ministers, who
under the election law resigned before the elections, have
been elected PC members. They include Nabil Shaath, Riad
Zaanoun, Ahmed Qreia (Abu Ala), Freih Abu Medein and Saeb Erekat.
</P>
<P>
Among the prominent independents who have won are Hanan
Ashrawi, chairman of the Palestinian Human rights and
spokeswoman for the Palestinian delegation to the Madrid
Mideast peace negotiations, Hassan Asfour, negotiator for the
Oslo talks,
</P>
<P>
Only four out of the 28 female candidates have been elected.
They are Ashrawi (Christian, independent) in Jerusalem, Wazir
(Fatah) in Gaza City, Dalah Salameh (Fatah) in Nablus and
Jamileh Sydem (Fatah) in Deir El-Balah.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Supreme Court Rejects California Appeal of New  Voter Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Supreme Court
Monday rejected a California appeal of the federal "motor voter
law," which lets people register to vote while getting drivers'
licenses.
</P>
<P>
The court turned down California Governor Pete Wilson's
contention that the law infringes on state sovereignty by
requiring states to pick up most of the costs.
</P>
<P>
Since the law, formally entitled the National Voter
Registration Act, came into effect a year ago more than 11 million
Americans have registered, according to the American Civil
Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
Seven states have challenged the law, none successfully so far.
California's appeal, the first to reach the Supreme Court, was
turned away without comment.
</P>
<P>
California lawyers said the law wrongly lets Congress
"commandeer state employees" who previously had no
voter-registration responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
California officials estimate the state will spend at least 18
million dollars in state funds each year to implement the law.
</P>
<P>
Wilson's appeal said the state's Department of Motor Vehicles
will have to hire 58 new employees to provide the voter
registration services.
</P>
<P>
A federal judge and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled
against Wilson.
</P>
<P>
Other states that have attacked the law in lower courts are
Illinois, Kansas, Michigan, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and
Virginia.

<P>
ANKARA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel today received a written message from his Russian
counterpart Boris Yeltsin, who thanked for Turkey's help in
freeing the Russian hostages kidnaped by pro-Chechen gunmen in
Turkey's Black Sea port of Trabzon.
</P>
<P>
"The two countries should intensify their cooperation in the
struggle against terrorism," Yeltsin said in his message.
</P>
<P>
The Anatolia News Agency also quoted Yeltsin as saying that
international terrorism is a threat against all humanity and that
the two countries will always work together against it.
</P>
<P>
Caretaker Prime Minister Tansu Ciller has promised her Russian
counterpart Viktor Chernomyrdin in a message that the pro-Chechen
gunmen would be judged in accordance with Turkish law.
</P>
<P>
Ciller added that the two countries should intensify
cooperation to ensure peace and provide peaceful solution to
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Nine pro-Chechen gunmen hijacked a ferry bound for Russia's
Sochi on January 16 and held more than 200 passengers and crew
members on board for three days before they surrendered in
Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
Among the hostages, 125 people were from Russia and
Ukraine. The gunmen, all of Caucasian origin, said they did so to
protest Russian troops' crackdown on Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
Turkish government succeeded in persuading the gunmen to
surrender and solved the crisis without bloodshed.
