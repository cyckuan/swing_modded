<HEADLINE> Greece Not to Accept Restrictions on Sovereignty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Greek government today rejected a
local newspaper report claiming that the United States had
proposed stationing vesseles of the sixth fleet in supposedly
"grey areas"in the Aegean.
</P>
<P>
"We know of no such proposal," government spokesman Dimitris
Reppas said today when asked to comment on a front-page article in
today's edition of the Athens daily "Ethnos" (the National).
</P>
<P>
He added that Greece, in any case, would under no circumstances
accept any restrictions on its sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, during U.S. Undersecretary of
State Peter Tarnof's recent visit to Athens, American side tried
to convince Athens to accept the so-called "confidence building"
measures in the Aegean suggested by Washington. These include
the limitation of military exercises, for aircraft not to carry
weaponary, and for the creation of "buffer zone" in disputed
Aegean areas such as the Imia islets. These areas would not be
approached by Greek and Turkish vessels and would be monitored
by the U.S.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Greece welcomed some of this package, but
not the idea of "buffer" or "grey" zones as this would imply that
these areas are not Greek but are in fact disputed.

<P>
LUSAKA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has no plan
to privatize all government owned media.
</P>
<P>
This was declared by Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Peter
Machungwa here today while reacting to a report of a local
magazine advocating privatization of all government owned mass
media.
</P>
<P>
He explained that privatizing all media would deny the
government the means to inform the nation correctly.
</P>
<P>
He noted that according to a manifesto of the ruling Movement
for Multi-Party Democracy, the state-owned media would serve as
vehicles to promote national unity, reconstruction, development
and international cooperation and that individuals and
organizations should have a right to own and operate their own
press and electronic facilities.

<P>
JERUSALEM, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Labor Party Chairman
and former Prime Minister Shimon Peres today said that Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's polices are not bringing peace,
Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a meeting of the leadership of the Labor Party, now
the main opposition party, Peres said that Netanyahu's statements
in the U.S. led one to a number of conclusions.
</P>
<P>
Peres pointed out that Israel must decide whether it wants the
next generation in the Middle East to be a generation of conflict,
or a generation of peace.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is currently in New York on his first official visit
to the U.S. since he won in the elections on May 29 and became the
first directly elected prime minister of Israel.
</P>
<P>
During his first two days in the U.S., Netanyahu, a hardliner,
made no discernible concessions neither on the Palestinian-related
issues, nor on the negotiations with the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
Also today, at a close meeting of the United Kibbutz Movement,
Peres said that not enough attentions have been paid to the
threats of Iran and the fundamentalist extremism.
</P>
<P>
"If Israel does not act accordingly, differences between the
Palestinians could snowball dangerously into an entirely conflict
between Jews and Moslems," said Peres.

<HEADLINE> Trolley-bus Explosion Injures Five in Downtown Moscow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 11 (Xinhua) -- At least five people were injured
when a bomb ripped off the front of a trolley-bus in downtown
Moscow this morning, laying down an early challenge to the
newly-appointed chief of Russia's Security Council Alexander Lebed.
</P>
<P>
Lebed, a retired paratrooper general who was named President
Boris Yeltsin's top security adviser Wednesday, said the explosion
was a "mad and senseless" terrorist attack "aimed at raising
tensions in the country."
</P>
<P>
He added that measures were being taken to track down the
perpetrator of the attack.
</P>
<P>
The explosion occurred at about 9 a.m. local time when the
trolley-bus was passing by Pushkin Square, the city's most popular
meeting place about one kilometer from the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
There were few people on the bus at the time.
</P>
<P>
The driver's cabin and the front of the bus was seriously
damaged as the explosives were put under the front door, the
Interior Ministry was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The cause of the accident is still under investigation. Moscow
Major Yuri Luzhkov said it was too early to say who was
responsible for the blast but he did not rule out the possible
connection with separatists from Chechnya, where renewed heavy
fighting broke out this week.
</P>
<P>
It was the second blast on Moscow's mass transportation system
in a month. Four people were killed in a bomb explosion on June
11 in the subway, just days before the country's presidential
elections.

<P>
MOSCOW, July 11 (Xinhua) -- A Russian army general was killed
in Chechnya this morning when his armored vehicle tramped upon a
land mine, Interfax news agency said.
</P>
<P>
Major General Nikolai Skripnik, deputy commander of Russian
interior ministry troops in North Caucasus, died of his wounds
shortly after the blast, which took place near the village of
Gekhi in southwestern Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Skripnik was the second Russian general to be killed in
Chechnya. In January 1995, Major General Viktor Vorobyov, the
commander of a special Russian interior ministry task force in the
breakaway republic, died in the regional capital Grozny.
</P>
<P>
Federal troops have been shelling Gekhi for two days, killing
some 20 civilians and injuring over 40.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Chechen government sources said that
federal troops' shelling against the village ended at 2:00
p.m. local time (10:00 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Eight federal soldiers died and over 20 were injured in the
fighting while the casualties incurred on the Chechen separatists
were still not available.

<HEADLINE> S.African Reserve Bank Governor on Future Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 11 (Xinhua) --Chris Stals, Governor of
the South African Reserve Bank, predicted today that an economic
growth rate of six percent, inflation below 7.6 percent and a real
bank rate of not more than three percent will be possibly achieved
in South Africa by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Stals made the remarks at the South African Institute of
International Affairs' two-day conference.
</P>
<P>
Stals said the Reserve Bank is ''enthusiastic''about the government's
recently-announced macro-economic strategy for growth, employment and
redistribution.
</P>
<P>
The macro-economic policy strategy, unveiled by Finance Minister
Trevor Manuel on June 14, presented an integrated medium-term
plan to boost economic development until the year 2000 and strengthen
the economy's long-term competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
Stals said he will encourage all sectors of the economy to lend
their full support to the realisation of the government's economic
goals.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the role the Reseve Bank should play in the strategy,
Stals said a real bank rate of not more than three percent was
possible by 2000 on conditions that the new macro-economic policy is
diligently implemented.
</P>
<P>
It could also be assumed that the annual inflation rate would
remain below 10 percent and could even be lower than the 7.6 percent
envisaged for 2000, he said.
</P>
<P>
An economic growth rate of six percent a year could be reached
provided everyone worked together in implementing the strategy.
</P>
<P>
To this extent, South Africa had a lot of reasons to be optimistic
about the current economic situation and the outlook for the coming
year, said the governor.
</P>
<P>
While commenting on the Rand's depreciation of about 20 percent
since mid-February, Stals said the volatility in the money market was
part of the price South Africa had to pay for joining the global
economy.
</P>
<P>
In retrospect, Stals said South Africa had weathered the storm
reasonably well and passed its first major test as a member of the
volatile global financial markets community.

Most buffalos live only 16 or 17 years, but the female buffalo,
a mother of five calves, lived 34 years and 11 months, which was
the human equivalent of about 90 years of age.

The previous record for a buffalo housed in a zoo was 28 years

ADDIS ABABA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia is under the grip of
a malaria epidemic with two million victims, a report said here
today.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, Oromiya, Amharaland, Tigray
and the Afarland are affected. The most affected is Amharaland,
particularly in the East Gojjam Zone where mortality rate has
reached an average of 5 persons a day.
</P>
<P>
The new eruption is blamed on the failure to keep up the
regular spray of DDT which the region had been used to. The
spraying of DDT was discontinued for one year.
</P>
<P>
The widespread flooding caused by the heavy rains had also
created a favourable condition for malaria breeding, the report
said.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Scientist Advises Less Use Of Cellular </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 11 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli scientist has
suggested limiting the use of cellular phones amid reports of
danger of radiation from cellular phones, reported Israel Radio
today.
</P>
<P>
The scientist advised that during a long conversation over the
cellular phone, one should occasionally shift the telephone from
one ear to the other in order to reduce any radiation damages
to the brain.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, six research scientists from
different parts of the world have spent some time looking into
the problems of dangerous radiation from cellular phones. As a
result two of them decided to quit using cellular phones
altogether. The other four from Sweden, Australia and the U.S.
stated that they intended to limit the use of cellular phones
for emergency only.
</P>
<P>
The scientists, appearing on the BBC television broadcast,
contended that constant use of cellular phones could lead to
cancer, alzheimer's disease and other disorder.
</P>
<P>
Here in Israel, a spokesman for Cellcom said that the World
Health Organization (WHO) has looked into the problem and
concluded that the radiation from cellular phones does not exceed
the safe level, while a Motorola spokesman claimed that medical
research has not revealed any danger to persons using cellular
phones.
</P>
<P>
Cellular phones are widely used in Israel. Motorola and
Cellcom are the country's two cellular phone providers. The
government is considering to issue a public tender for a
third supplier of cellular phone service.

<HEADLINE> Seminar to Boost Nigeria's Declining Textile </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Top executives of Nigeria's textile
industry will gather here on July 30 to probe ways to revitalize
the industry, it was announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The executive management summit, a seminar tagged "Textiems
'96", is coming in the wake of the worrisome decline in the
fortunes of the textile manufacturing sub-sector over recent
years, said an official with the organizing committee.
</P>
<P>
Statistics shows that the industry has a capacity of some 1.7
billion meters of fabrics a year, but it has been struggling to
operate at slightly above 25 percent of the installed capacity.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the industry's growth rate of 12.75 percent in the
1970s declined to 7.5 percent in the 1980s and below one percent
last year.
</P>
<P>
"This is an unfortunate reverse in the economic wellbeing of
the nation," the official said.
</P>
<P>
The textile industry, if fully revitalized, has the potentials
of arresting the growing rate of employment in the nation since
it is labor intensive.
</P>
<P>
The industry, which employs about 250,000 workers nationwide
at present, is the second largest employer of organized labor in
the country.

KIEV, July 11 (Xinhua) -- President Leonid Kuchma appointed
today Oleksandr Kuzmuk, former head of the Ukrainian National
Guard, as the country's new defense minister, the Interfax news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>

republic, saying he had performed his duties badly.
</P>
<P>
Shmarov, who had been defense minister since October 1994, had

<HEADLINE> Unlimited Market Demands Endangers Seahorses: WWF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) said
today that unless the market demands for seahorses were checked,
the population of this wild sea animal could crash.
</P>
<P>
Seahorse is thought to have existed for at least 40 million
years. At least 20 million seahorses, live or dead, are being
traded worldwide each year, involving at least 32 nations.
</P>
<P>
Their prices range from up to 1,200 U.S. dollars per kilogram
in Hong Kong to 11.49 dollars for a dried seahorse in Japan,
depending partly on size, said WWF.
</P>
<P>
A recent report, entitled "The International Trade in
Seahorses," lists the largest seahorse importers as China, Hong
Kong and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The largest exporter is India, with annual sales of at least
1.3 million seahorses or 3,000 kilograms of that sea animal,
followed by the Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Seahorses are used as traditional medicines in China, Japan and
Korea, which are believed to benefit a range of conditions,
including respiratory disorders, sexual dysfunctions and general
lethargy and pain.
</P>
<P>
Some countries like Canada, Germany, the Netherlands and the
United Kingdom import seahorses as curios or aquarium pets.

Meanwhile the country sends its first woman participant to the

The report said that Iranian women may compete abroad in only
five sporting events, equestrian, skiing, shooting, chess and
sports for the handicapped because other disciplines make them
violate Islamic dress codes -- black cover over the whole body

<HEADLINE> U.S. Again Rejects Japan's Microchip Pact Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States today again turned
down Japan's proposal that the two countries should sign a
multilateral accord on microchip trade with the European Union
(EU), saying that EU members are not major semiconductor producers.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters at the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo,
U.S. Ambassador to Japan Walter Mondale also stressed the
necessity for the two countries to reach a bilateral pact as the
major semiconductor producer countries.
</P>
<P>
Japan and the U.S. have differences in whether to renew the
current five-year bilateral microchip agreement which is due to
expire on July 31.
</P>
<P>
Washington wants to renew it, while Tokyo is pushing for
replacing the accord with a multilateral one involving the EU.
</P>
<P>
According to the old pact, Japan has to reserve at least 20
percent of the domestic market for foreign chips, which, as the
country argued, is unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. offered to drop the 20 percentage target, but still
stuck to calculating and monitoring the foreign market share in
line with the old pact.
</P>
<P>
Japan and the EU on Monday rejected monitoring the foreign
market share in the semiconductor market in any given country as a
way of gauging the openness of the market.
</P>
<P>
They also turned down the use of numerical targets or anything
similar to it in microchip trade.
</P>
<P>
The EU, which considered the 1991 Japan-U.S. accord going
against the interests of European chip makers, sided with Japan on
establishing a multilateral cooperative framework.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Japan Start Photo Film Talks in Geneva </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Negotiators from the United States
and Japan started on Wednesday an initial round of bilateral talks
under the auspices of the World Trade Organization (WTO) to sort
out a photo film trade dispute between them.
</P>
<P>
The talks, sought by the United States as the first step to set
in motion the dispute settlement procedure of the WTO, will be
held in Geneva, where the WTO based, for two days, trade officials
said.
</P>
<P>
Washington filed a complaint with the WTO on June 13, accusing
the Japanese government of "unreasonable practices" that lock out
foreign products from the Japanese consumer photo film and paper
market.
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth complaint filed by the U.S. against Japan
since establishment of the WTO in January 1995.
</P>
<P>
"The essence of the U.S. complaint is that the government of
Japan intentionally created a set of interlocking barriers (to
foreign film products) to counteract its commitments under the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and other
international agreements," said U.S. chief negotiator James
Southwick Wednesday at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
"Those barrier continue to be in place and continue to restrict
market access," added Southwick, who is also U.S. Deputy Assistant
Trade Representative for Japan.
</P>
<P>
Washington took the case to the WTO after an 11-month
investigation into U.S. Film maker Eastman Kodak Co's petition
charging that Japan's Fuji Photo Film Co. and the Japanese
government have been collaborating to block access to the Japanese
market.
</P>
<P>
Specificly, Washington complained that Japan's Premiums and
Misrepresentation Law restricts the use of sales incentives by
foreign companies trying to break into Japanese market.
</P>
<P>
It also argued that the Large-Scale Retail Store Law of Japan,
which regulates the size and operating hours of department stores
and other large retailers, constitutes a serious barrier for Kodak
and other foreign companies, violating WTO's General Agreement on
Trade in Services.
</P>
<P>
Accord to Southwick, the consultations will start with the
second issue Wednesday afternoon and will tackle the first issue
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese officials expect to prove that there is no
discrimination against foreign products in the Japanese market.
They will also try to show that the retail store law doesn't
violate the services agreement and has nothing to do with a
decline in Kodak's Japanese market share, trade sources here said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. also demands bilateral talks with Japan outside of WTO
dispute settlement proceedings to discuss what it considers to be
restrictive private-sector business practices in Japan.
</P>
<P>
However, according to Southwick, the two sides were unable to
schedule this consultation in this round and he hoped that they
could enter into consultations on this issue in the near future.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. negotiator declined to speculate on what kind of
outcome could be expected from this round of talks. "We'll try to
explaining our views and address questions from the other side.
Beyond that it is difficult to predict," he said.
</P>
<P>
If the bilateral talks can not reach an agreement within 60
days, The U.S. can ask the WTO to set up a panel to rule over the
dispute.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Military Not Welcome in Okinawa: Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Okinawan governor Masahide Ota told
Japan's Supreme Court here today that the Okinawan people now are
tired of the U.S. military presence on the island.
</P>
<P>
Ota appeared before the court's all 15 judges to defend his
refusal to cooperate with the Japanese government over its drive
to renew leases to the U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
He said that his decision resulted from his responsibility to
protect the Okinawa's islanders.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa has long borne an unfair share of the U.S. military
presence in Japan, said he, adding that Tokyo should stop the
policy that forces the islanders to lease their land.
</P>
<P>
Okinawa hosts some 75 percent of the 47,000 U.S. troops in
Japan, and the U.S. bases amount to 20 percent of its area.
</P>
<P>
The people of Okinawa have long complained about the heavy
concentration of the U.S. bases on the island, but it was the rape
of an Okinawan schoolgirl by three U.S. servicemen last year that
sparked the landowners' protests against the continued U.S.
military presence on the island, 1,600 kilometers southwest of
Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
Under the growing pressure from Okinawa, the United States has
agreed with Japan in April to reduce about 20 percent of the land
it currently uses in Okinawa in the coming five years.

based at London's Gatwick Airport, improved rates of pay for
newly-qualified pilots, the refitting of bunk beds on long-haul
747 jumbo jets to allow pilots to sleep between shifts, etc..
</P>
<P>
The agreement comes after three days of intensive negotiations.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) is to establish a parliamentary
forum in a bid to strengthen democracy and promote development,
the South African Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentary speakers and parliamentarians from the 12 SADC
member states were expected to meet in Namibian capital Windhoek
on Monday for the establishment, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the need for the regional forum, Namibian speaker
Moses Tjitendero said development could not be achieved without
political support, no matter how much funding was available.
</P>
<P>
Tjitendero said there is a conspicuous absence of direct
representation of SADC citizens in the group's operational
organs. In this regard, he said, elected parliamentarians are in
the best position to know the views of their constituencies and
strategically placed to strengthen the links between them and
SADC.
</P>
<P>
By obliging parliamentarians to articulate the views of the
public, the proposed parliamentary forum would compel them to
regularly consult their constituencies in regional matters.
</P>
<P>
''the exercise will not only involve the masses in
contributing towards policy formulation, but will also afford
policy formulators complete and first-hand information necessary
to arrive at policy consensus,'' said tjitendero.
</P>
<P>
Namibian President Sam Nujoma is expected to officially
establish the forum in Windhoek on Monday.
</P>

Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland,
Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Extend 120-Million-Dollar Loan to Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 10 (Xinhua) -- Japan will extend to Lebanon 120
million U.S. dollars in soft loan for 25 years with a 2.5 percent
interest rate in addition to a seven-year grace period, according
to a protocol signed here today by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The protocol was signed by Fuad Sinyoura, Lebanese Minister of
State of Financial Affairs and Yasuji Ishigaki, Japan's ambassador
to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference following the signing ceremony, the
Lebanese minister announced that the soft loan will be used "to
update the sectors of water, health and environment in Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
"The agreement signed today comes within a series of steps
which our two governments have taken in order to consolidate the
bilateral relations," Sinyoura added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that since the reopening of the Japanese Embassy in
Beirut one and half years ago, the two countries had exerted
efforts to consolidate the bilateral relations, including a visit
by the minister to Japan in April and a visit by Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri to Tokyo in June.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that there are a lot of fields where Lebanon can
obtain additional and soft loans from Japan," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Japanese ambassador said that the loan is the
first one the Japanese government provided to Lebanon since the
establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries in the
1950s.
</P>
<P>
He said that the loan would be used to treat the maritime
pollution along the Lebanese coast and to build networks of water
distribution in Kesrwan province in northern Lebanon.

HANOI, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's consumer prices rose by
3.3 percent in the first half of this year, the lowest growth rate
in five years, official statistics show.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the prices rose by 11.4 percent, according to a report

Meanwhile, Vietnam also recorded the lowest inflation rate of

rate will remain in single digital for the rest of the year.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said the government should try to keep the
inflation rate in pace with the economic growth rate and remain
between 9 to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
They also said the government need to regulate money supply and
relax credit tightening.
</P>
<P>
In turn, the exchange rate between the Vietnamese Dong and hard

<HEADLINE> South Koreans Demand Compensation From U.S. Military </HEADLINE>

<P>
SEOUL, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Villagers living near a
U.S. military base in South Korea plan to file a suit against the
state demanding compensation for the damage they have sustained
from the noise coming from the firing range of the base.
</P>
<P>
Involved in the move are about 3,500 people from 730 households
located near the firing range of the 7th United States Air Force
in Hwasong County of Kyonggi province.
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for demanding 12,500 dollars per person in
compensation for a total of 43.8 million dollars for mental and
physical damage they claim have sustained from the noise caused by
bombing and shooting exercises at the firing range since it was
established in 1968.
</P>
<P>
This will be the first time for villagers to ask for
compensation from the state in connection with the "military
noise" in the country's history.
</P>
<P>
"In the initial stage, we plan to file a 1.25
million-U.S.-dollar compensation suit before the end of this month
and another suit asking for the rest of the expected compensation
will be filed later after we evaluate developments," said Chon
Man-kyu, chairman of the committee pushing for compensation.
</P>
<P>
The villagers also plan to submit a petition to the National
Assembly urging compensation for the noise damage and seek the
formation of a consultative body on the matter with the Defense
Ministry, American forces and villagers represented.
</P>
<P>
Some 37,000 American troops are currently stationed in South
Korea.

LUANDA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Population Fund
(UNFPA) resident representative in Angola Georges Georgi said

about negative effects, because a country cannot deal with the
rapidly increasing demand caused by high population growth rate.
</P>
<P>
He noted that a protracted civil war and the mass
migration of population from rural to urban areas have led to an
unbalanced distribution of population in the country.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Denies Japanese Statement on Newly-Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Egypt has denied that Japanese
scientists have found evidence pointing to the existence of an
unearthed pyramid in Sakkara, 15 kilometers south of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
Zahi Hawas, head of Egypt's Giza Plateau Antiquities
Directorate, said that the Japanese researchers' announcement is
groundless, Egypt's only English-language daily The Egyptian
Gazette reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, the researchers claimed that they had
based their assumption on photos taken by a satellite, saying that
they were able to observe the foundation walls of the pyramid in
Sakkara.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the paper said, preliminary excavations by a
Japanese team revealed the remains of one wall.
</P>
<P>
But Hawas said that the Japanese mission is based in Dahshur,
35 kilometers south of Cairo, instead of Sakkara.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Halim Nureddin, Secretary General of the Egypt's Supreme
Council for Antiquities, also said that a report submitted by the
Japanese mission excavating in Dahshur is void of any reference to
the claimed discovery of the pyramid.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that none of the foreign or national excavating
teams in Egypt has the right to make announcements about new finds
until the Supreme Council for Antiquities has been officially
notified.
</P>
<P>
Hawas said that what the Japanese have found might be a tomb
rather than a pyramid.
</P>
<P>
He stated that an aerial survey had been previously conducted
in Sakkara revealing walls made of sun-dried bricks pertaining to
tombs rather than pyramids.
</P>
<P>
A total of 97 pyramids have been found in Egypt.

<HEADLINE> Int'l Court Issues Arrest Warrants for Bosnian Serb Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 11 (Xinhua) -- An international court handed out
arrest warrants again today against Bosnian Serb leader Radovan
Karadzic and his military commander Ratko Mladic.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations war crimes tribunal for former Yugoslavia,
based in the Hague, the Netherlands, issued the warrants after
about two weeks of hearings on war crimes committed in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Under the international warrants, Karadzic and Mladic can be
arrested anywhere on charges of alleged genocide and crimes
against humanity, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Indicted twice by the tribunal, the two men have refused to
surrender to the jurisdiction of the court, which was set up by
the U.N. Security Council in 1993 without enforcement powers.
</P>
<P>
They have been accused of being the architects of major
atrocities allegedly carried out by their forces, including the
torture, rape and mass murder of Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Although atrocities have been blamed on all warring parties in
the 44-month Bosnian war, international observers say the bulk
have been committed by Serbs.
</P>
<P>
French judge Claude Jorda, who read the ruling today, was
quoted as saying that the U.N. war crimes tribunal "unanimously
reconfirmed the two indictments" against Karadzic and Mladic.
</P>
<P>
The resulting arrest warrants will be immediately sent to
Interpol and all U.N. member states, requiring them to arrest the
two Serb leaders, said tribunal spokesman Christian Chartier.
</P>
<P>
However, of the 75 suspects the court has indicted so far, only
seven have been under custody in the Hague.
</P>
<P>
The two Bosnian Serb leaders are believed to be living in their
self-proclaimed Serb Republic of Srpska or neighboring Serbia.

<HEADLINE> Expert: Computer Creates Education Gap between Males and </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 11 (Xinhua) -- An Israeli expert on computer
education said that computer is likely to increase the education
gap between male and female students, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Ze'ev Degani, chairman of the Computer Education Conference
which concluded in Jerusalem Wednesday, said that in recent years
he has discoved that computer has become what he called enemy of
the equality of sexes.
</P>
<P>
Degani claimed that male students are much more attracted to
computers compared with female ones.
</P>
<P>
While females tend to use computers only to get their essential
work done, males usually handle computers in a much more expert
way.
</P>
<P>
He said that the problem is that "we live in a society where
swift and skilled use of computer is necessary in order to
succeed."
</P>
<P>
Israel has attached great importance to the popularization of
computers in schools. According to Haim Tirosh, Chairman of the
Israel Association for Computer Education, all of Israel's 2,400
schools will have a modern computer lab within four years, thus
making it the first country in the world with so many computers
in its educational system.

GENEVA, July 11 (xinhua) -- U.S. and Japanese trade negotiators
failed to reach an agreement after two days of an initial round
talks in Geneva on their dispute over access by U.S. firms to the
Japanese photo film and paper market, negotiators said on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"No outcome for the moment yet," Japanese chief negotiator Yun
Yokota, deputy chief of Japan's Geneva mission, told reporters
after the talks. He said it had not decided whether there would be
a follow-up or not.
</P>
<P>
James Southwick, U.S. deputy assistant trade representative
said that the two side had "full discussions of the issues that we
raised and requested for consultations".
</P>
<P>
"At the time we have not agreed on another date or whether
we'll have further consultations. We've agreed to be in contact on
that question," he said after the talks at the World Trade
Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The talks are the first step in the WTO's dispute settlement
procedure. If no agreement could be reached within 60 days. The
U.S. can ask the WTO to set up an independent panel to rule over
the issue, as now seems highly likely.
</P>
<P>
U.S. negotiators on Wednesday expressed confidence that
Washington would win the the case if it went to a WTO panel.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Stoler, deputy chief of of the U.S. Trade
Representative's office in Geneva, told a news conference that the
U.S. decision to bring the case to the WTO "reflect the fact that
we believe very strongly that we have a very strong case to make".
</P>
<P>
Yokota, however, insisted that Japan had firm reasons to reject
the U.S. charges.
</P>
<P>
"Our market is open," he said on Wednesday, "We import about
130 million of photographic goods and paper into Japan, and the
U.S. has about 10 percent of the Japanese market."
</P>
<P>
Washington took the case to the WTO after an 11-month
investigation into U.S. Film maker Eastman Kodak Co's petition
charging that Japan's Fuji Photo Film Co. and the Japanese
government have been collaborating to block access to the Japanese
market.
</P>
<P>
Kodak argues that barriers in the Japanese market have cost it
at least 5.6 billion in lost revenues since 1975.
</P>
<P>
Japan counters that Japanese companies face similar problems
in the U.S. market, where Kodak's market share surpassing 70
percent.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: British MPs Award Themselves a Big Pay Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- British MPs have brushed aside both
party leaders' call for restraint and defended their decision to
award themselves a 26 percent pay rise in a move which is certain
to fuel intense anger among the public sector workers.
</P>
<P>
The MPs voted last night by 279 votes to 154 to accept a
controversial proposal that their salaries should immediately rise
from 34085 pounds (51127 US dollars) to 43000 pounds (64500 US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Although all 126 members of the Government payroll vote were
supposed to turn out an vote for Prime Minister John Major's
recommendation of 3 percent pay rise, 16 failed to do so.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of Tony Blair's shadow cabinet also either abstained
or voted against the 3 percent pay rise.
</P>
<P>
The vote followed a recommendation from the independent Senior
Salaries Review Body (SSRB) that MPs should get the 26 percent
rise.
</P>
<P>
The SSRB, which was commissioned by the government to carry out
the study, has argued that the increases should be seen as a
one-off measure.
</P>
<P>
In a separate move, they voted to give the prime minister and
cabinet ministers pay increases of 70 percent and 48 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the salary of the prime minister will rise to
143000 pounds (214500 US dollars) after the next election while a
cabinet minister's pay will go through the 100000 pounds (150000
US dollars) level for the first time.
</P>
<P>
The MPs' 26 percent increase was tempered by a large vote --
376 to 39 -- cutting the top mileage rate for MPs' cars from 74.1p
(1.1 US dollars) to 47.2p (70 US cents) a mile after widespread
criticism because it encourages them to set an environmentally bad
example by buying large gas-guzzling cars.
</P>
<P>
They also voted for an increase in their office accommodation
allowance by a narrower majority of 26, backdating this to April 1
this year. The changes will also help the 100 MPs retiring at the
election by increasing their allowance to return to normal life.
</P>
<P>
In the two-hour debate which preceded the votes, MPs argued
that the salaries had fallen behind those in the public and
private sectors.
</P>
<P>
After the vote, Sir Terence Higgins, a senior backbench Tory
who led the campaign for a substantial pay increase, said there
was a "very real danger" that the quality of the Commons would
decline if people were deterred from entering politics by poor
rates of pay.
</P>
<P>
Another Tory MP John Carlisle said it proved that the
Government was totally out of step with the mood of the Commons.
"It has emerged from this sorry spectacle with a bloody nose," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Winston Churchill, who voted for the full pay increase,
criticised the Government for attempting to reject the
recommendations of the review body, SSRB.
</P>
<P>
"What's the point of having a review body if you just throw the
report in the bin?" he asked. "I do believe that MPs are
scandalously underpaid."
</P>
<P>
However, angry arguments are even stronger, Rodney
Bickerstaffe, general secretary of Britain's largest trade union,
Unison, told BBC Radio the MPs' decision would outrage ordinary
workers struggling to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
"What about those people out there who are doing wonderful work
for next to nothing? We don't expect plaster saints of our MPs,
but if they are trying to set an example, they ought to think
about this," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ken Cameron of the Fire Brigades' union said nurses earning a
quarter of what MPs got had been told in February that their four
percent increase would have to be gradually phased in rather than
implemented immediately.
</P>
<P>
"I think those people will be absolutely appalled at the
hypocrisy of members of parliament," he said.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here believe that the result will make it
more difficult for Kenneth Clarke, the Chancellor, to impose a pay
squeeze on public sector workers later this year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Considering Sanctions against Burma </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States is
considering economic sanctions against Burma as a way of penalties
to impel Burma to make some reforms.
</P>
<P>
State Secretary Warren Christopher said on Thursday at a joint
news conference with Danish foreign Minister Niels Helveg
Petersen, who met later on the same day, that the time has come
for a stiff symbol of pretext against the Burmese government.
</P>
<P>
"Economic sanctions are unlikely at the present time,"
Christopher said. "But it's under active consideration right now."
</P>
<P>
He said the United States will try first to consult with the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which includes Brunei, the
Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam,
during a meeting in Jakarta this month.
</P>
<P>
The United States wants to elicit support from ASEAN, of which
Burma is a new member, on the question of sanctions, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration's consideration of sanctions came
after the Burmese government blocked a gathering in May of Aung
San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy, and the death of
James Leander Nichols, Denmark's honorary consul in Rangoon, who
was sentenced to three years of imprisonment and fined $5,000 for
possessing a facsimile machine and telephone without the proper
authorization. He died of a heart attack in jail.
</P>
<P>
Petersen told the news conference before talks with Christopher
that Denmark has put sanctions against Burma on the agenda for a
meeting next week of the European Union foreign ministers.

CAIRO, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
returned here this evening after a one-day working visit to
Turkey, during which he held talks with his counterpart Suleyman
Demirel and other Turkish senior officials.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak discussed with Demirel a military agreement between
Turkey and Israel, under which Israel can use Turkey's air bases
and air space in military trainings.
</P>
<P>
Following the meeting in Ankara, Mubarak softened his country's
objection to the agreement signed in February, saying that he now
understands it is aimed at training and does not aim to form a
military "pact" in this region.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, Syria and some other Arab states, fearing that Turkey
and Israel might forge a military alliance that could threaten the
Arab security, had called on Turkey to reconsider the agreement.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference with Demirel, Mubarak said the
talks also dealt with bilateral relations, the Middle East peace
process and other regional and international issues of mutual
concern.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak expressed pleasure over the level of the bilateral
relations, adding that "we have agreed that the concerned sides
(in the Mideast peace process) should abide by their commitments
coming from international agreements."
</P>
<P>
An agreement on good neighborhood, friendship and cooperation
between Turkey and Egypt will be signed when Demirel visits Egypt
in the future, Mubarak said.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The UN Conference on Trade and
Development said on Thursday that it has developed a new training
course to help developing countries and economies in transition to
engage in multilateral trade negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The course covers trade agreements of both the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) and that of the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
It seeks to help trade executives and advisers from the private

<HEADLINE> UNITA Official on Formation of Unified Army in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Staff Headquarters of the
armed forces of Angola's former rebel UNITA movement should
have a hand in the selection of its soldiers for a unified army.
</P>
<P>
Isaias Samakuva, UNITA representative in the Joint Committee
overseeing the peace process in Angola, made the remarks in an
interview with Angola State Radio here today.
</P>
<P>
One of the factors which have impeded the smooth progress of
the integration of the UNITA and government armed forces into the
unified army is that the UNITA Staff Headquarters has not
participated in the work, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the formation of the unified army, the two sides should
cooperate since it is an unusual recruitment, he said.
</P>
<P>
The work to select UNITA soldiers for the unified army started
on July 1. Under an initial plan, 26,000 UNITA soldiers should be
recruited into the unified army by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
However, Joao de Matos, the Chief of General Staff of the
government forces, announed yesterday that the angolan government
has decided to suspend the formation of the unified army and
withdraw its personnel working in the assembly points for the
seclection of former UNITA rebels. enditem

<HEADLINE> Botswana Arms Deal With Netherlands Not Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOAHNNESBURG, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Botswana Defence Force
(BDF) has not been officially informed that the German government
would not allow the Netherlands to export 50 German-made leopard
tanks to Botswana, a BDF spokesman said today in Gaborone.
</P>
<P>
Press reports on Tuesday quoted German Bundestag Deputy
Speaker Burkhard Hirsch as telling Namibian officials that
Germany would not agree to the Botswana-Netherlands arms deal.
</P>
<P>
Hirsch passed on his government's assurance that the deal
would be blocked when he met Namibian Prime Minister Hage Geingob
and Speaker Mose Tjitendero in Windhoek on Monday.
</P>
<P>
After the Botswana-Netherlands arms deal was made public last
month, Namibia, as a neighbour of Botswana, claimed the reported
Botswana's arms purchase to be "provocative and unnecessary".
</P>
<P>
Namibian President Sam Nujoma discussed the issue with German
leaders during his recent visit to Germany.
</P>
<P>
Botswana has been arguing that its military buildup is part of
a long-term plan to beef up its deterrence capability.
</P>
<P>
BDF Commander Lieutenant-general Seretse Khama Ian Khama said
last week if Botswana failed to get the tanks from the Dutch, it
would get them from elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the proposed 50 German-made leopard tanks, Botswana
has reportedly bought 13 Canadian f-5 fighter-bomber aircrafts,
36 British scorpion tanks, 200 troop transport vehicles and a
variety of weaponary.

<HEADLINE> 30-Year Mortgage Rates Up to 17-Month High in US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The national average for
30-year fixed-rate mortgages in the U.S. increased sharply to 8.42
percent this week, according to a survey released today by the
U.S. Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
</P>
<P>
The average was the highest level in nearly 17 months since the
mortgages had averaged 8.62 percent in early March 1995.
</P>
<P>
The 30-year fixed-rate mortgages have been rising quickly this
year and the average this week was much higher than last January
when it was 7.03 percent, the lowest since a 9.15 percent in the
same month of 1995.
</P>
<P>
On one-year adjustable rate mortgages, lenders were asking an
average initial rate of 6.01 percent, up from 5.94 percent last
week.
</P>
<P>
Mortgages with a 15-year term, a popular option for homeowners
who are refinancing, averaged 7.93 percent this week, up from 7.67
percent last week.
</P>
<P>
The increase of mortgage rates has resulted in May's decline of
housing starts in the country and is expected to slow down the
sales of both new and existing homes in the future.

<HEADLINE> Serb Ruling Party Has Equal Treatment in Election: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Robert Frowick, mission head for
Bosnia of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe
(OSCE), said today the Bosnian Serbian Democratic Party (SDS)
would receive equal treatment as other political parties in the
upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
Frowick made the remarks in Pale, the Serb administrative
center, after holding a closed-door meeting with Biljana Plavsic,
acting president of the Serb state Republika Srpska, over the
first post-war elections in Bosnia. Under the Dayton agreement,
the OSCE is responsible for organizing and monitoring the
September elections in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Frowick said the SDS, the ruling party in Republika
Srpska, would not be allowed to take part in the elections if its
leader Radovan Karadzic, an indicted war criminal suspect,
retained position in the party.
</P>
<P>
But the Contact Group, after meeting in London Wednesday, said
the Bosnia elections should be held as planned and all political
parties, both from the Muslim-Croat federation and Republika
Srpska, should take part in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Frowick also told reporters that the people of Republika
Srpska were encouraged to vote for whichever political party they
wanted to.
</P>
<P>
He said the election campaign would begin Monday. In a message
to the Serb population, he said that "the joint aim is that the
elections are fair and democratic."
</P>
<P>
The results of the elections, to be verified by the
international community, would confirm the existence of Republika
Srpska and its ruling structures, Frowick said.

CAIRO, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Ambassador in Cairo David
Sultan will sue an Egyptian opposition newspaper for libeling
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The English-language newspaper Al-Ahram Weekly quoted Sultan as
saying that the Liberal Party newspaper Al-Ahrar constantly
referred to Netanyahu as Neten Yahu, which could be read in Arabic
as meaning "rotten Yahu."
</P>
<P>
By doing so, Sultan said, the newspaper repeatedly held
Netanyahu in contempt.

Sultan said earlier this week that he was "determined to take
legal action against the newspaper," according to Al Ahram Weekly.
</P>
<P>
But the paper did not make it clear when Sultan will take legal
action.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Syria Disappointed with Clinton-Netanyahu Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Syria is disappointed with the
outcome of the meeting between U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Washington, local
official sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Syria is disappointed with the American
stance because the Clinton Administration has failed to exercise
pressure on Israel to return to the negotiating table on the basis
of the land-for-peace formula.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in the U.S., the Israeli Prime Minister had
again rejected the land-for-peace principle and reaffirmed his
adherence to the expansion of Jewish settlements and
non-withdrawal from the Arab territories including the Golan
Heights.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Netanyahu's visit to Washington was meant
"to win America's support of his stringent policy on the peace
process."
</P>
<P>
They accused him of exploiting the upcoming U.S. presidential
elections to exercise pressure on the U.S. government and pushing
for more American military assistance.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Clinton and Defense Secretary William Perry agreed
to strengthen military cooperation with Israel by promising it an
early warning system against possible missile attacks, and further
cooperation in the intelligence and anti-terrorism fields.
</P>
<P>
The sources also accused Netanyahu of seeking to drive the
Syrian-US relations toward further deterioration by accusing
Damascus of supporting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has reportedly expressed readiness to supply the
U.S. government with information gathered by Israeli intelligence
on Syria's support of terrorist activities, and called upon
America to impose economic sanctions against Syria.
</P>
<P>
Local press today also criticized Netanyahu's hardline
statements in Washington and warned the U.S. of possible failure
of the Middle East peace process, saying that the U.S. would be held
responsible for a possible return of vicious circle of tension to
the region.

<HEADLINE> President Mandela Raps British Colonialism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Visiting South African President
Nelson Mandela today launched verbal attacks upon British
colonialism, but stressed he has come to make friends.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a joint session of the British parliament earlier
today, President Mandela severely criticized the old British
colonists by saying that it was their colonization in the 18th
century that sowed the seeds of white supremacy in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mandela, who arrived here Tuesday for his first state visit to
Britain, pointed out that his predecessors had come to London to
appeal in vain to the former colonial power for Africans to be
treated equally as with whites.
</P>
<P>
"Despite that rebuff and terrible cost we had to bear as a
consequence, we return to this honored place neither with pikes
nor a desire for revenge nor, even, a plea to your distinguished
selves to assuage our hunger for bread," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Mandela stressed that he had come to Britain to make
friends and he also paid tribute to "millions of ordinary Britons
who stood up to say no to apartheid."
</P>
<P>
"Our emancipation is their reward. We know that the freedom we
enjoy is a richly textured gift hand-crafted by ordinary folk who
would not allow that their dignity as human beings should be
insulted," he added.
</P>
<P>
The black president also noted that the ordinary people had
realized the real nature of the regime and refused to hang their
hands in shame.
</P>
<P>
President Mandela is the first foreign statesman to be accorded
the honor of speaking to the British parliament at the Westminster
Hall since French President Charles de Gaulle in 1960.

<HEADLINE> French Doctor Protests Sale of Human Cord Cell </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 11 (Xinhua) -- A leading French doctor in
transplantation of marrow and umbilical cord cells has protested
the issuing of a certificate for a U.S. company -- the Biocyte --
to sell human umbilical cord cells in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The British magazine Nature published today the letter of
protest entitled "Certificates against Transplantations," written
by Professor Eliane Gluckman of Saint-Louis Hospital in Paris.
</P>
<P>
Gluckman said that such certificates violate the ethic and
principle of non-commercialization of human body and free and
anonymous organ donations, as have been recognized by the
International Association of Transplantations.
</P>
<P>
While expressing his shock over the intervention by the
industrial world into the science of marrow transplantations, he
said that 14 medical teams specialized in transplanting umbilical
cord blood cells in Europe have decided to "stand in the way of
this certification."
</P>
<P>
Gluckman, a pioneer in transplantation of umbilical cord cells,
said that the commercialization of the cells could jeopardize what
he described as "the promising therapeutical use of
transplantation of these cells" in blood diseases, cancer and
genetic therapy.
</P>
<P>
This action is supported by French winner of the 1980 Nobel
Prize in Medical Sciences Jean Dausset and a number of American
medical scientists, including Rochard O'Reilly of the Memorial
Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, who signed their names
on this letter.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Gluckman made the first successful transplantation of
umbilical cord cells on an American youth suffering from anaemia
of Fanconi, a disease which can be deadly.
</P>
<P>
The operation showed that umbilical cord cells could be
alternative to bony marrow, which is not always available in
hospital.
</P>
<P>
Since then, some 200 umbilical cord cell transplantations have
been made on patients suffering from leukemia and other genetic
diseases, according to Doctor Helene Esperoux.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, the commercial firm Cryo-Cell
International was given a certificate in 1993 to sell umbilical
cord cells.

GENEVA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- A Hutu rebel group of Burundi today
warned the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
not to send aid convoys to Northwest Burundi as being asked by the
Burundi government, the UNHCR said today.
</P>
<P>
The group, which calls itself the Party for the Liberation of
Hutu People, warned that without its consent, the UNHCR should not
send aid convoys to the Northwest province of Cibitoke in Burundi
"under whatever pretext."
</P>
<P>
UNHCR spokeswoman Christiane Berthiaume said the refugee agency
took the warning "very seriously."
</P>
<P>
Under the request of the Burundi government, the UNHCR has been
studying the possibility to send convoys to Cibitoke to deliver
food, quilt and other humanitarian materials.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic fightings escalated in the Burundi province in recent
months. Reports said hundreds of people are fleeing the area
everyday.
</P>
<P>
Early last month in the same area, three employees of the
International Committee of the Red Cross were killed when their
vehicles came under fire near a village. The above-mentioned Hutu
group is allegedly responsible for the incident.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Irish government has expressed
grave concern over the British government's latest decision to
reverse a ban on the Protestant parade through a Roman Catholic
area in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The Irish government said in an official statement earlier
today, "The (Irish) government is gravely concerned at the events
on th Graveaghy Road today. The abrupt reversal of the decision
about the route of the Orange Order parade is to be regretted."
</P>
<P>
"It runs counter to the previously agreed approach by both
governments to accord parity of esteem to both the nationalist and
unionist communities," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time in several months that the Irish
government openly criticized the British government, with which it
is working for a long-term solution to Northern Ireland's 27-year
conflict.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Northern Ireland police had earlier
reversed the ban by the Protestant Orange Order because of four
nights of violence by the Protestants protesting the ban.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the BBC television quoted Irish Prime Minister John
Bruton as saying in Paris earlier today that Dublin "is fully
conscious of the anger which today's decision has caused to the
nationlist community in Northern Ireland but we appeal to all
concerned to show the utmost restraint in this situation."
</P>
<P>
"We have already conveyed to the British government at the
highest level our concern at this development," he said, adding
that he would contact his British counterpart, John Major, to
"seek an explanation for this decision."

<HEADLINE> South Korea to Invest 1.7 Bln Pounds in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- South Korean industrial
conglomerate Lucky Goldstar (LG) is to invest 1.7 billion pounds
(2.6 billion US dollars) to build an electronics complex in south
Wales, said local press reports today.
</P>
<P>
The project, hailed as the largest inward investment ever made
in Europe, is expected to create directly 6,100 jobs and a further
15,000 jobs in supplier and support industries.
</P>
<P>
Two factories, a semiconductor production facility and a
consumer electronics plant producing television parts, will be
built over the next five years on a 250-acre site at Imperial
Park, Newport, Gwent, one of Britain's worst unemployment black
spots.
</P>
<P>
Wales has secured the investment after 10 months of tough
negotiations in the face of intense competition from other
countries and other British regions, notably from the North East
of England and from Scotland.
</P>
<P>
The investment will underline Britain's position as the most
powerful magnet for foreign investment in the European Union and
will reinforce Britain's position as the semi-conductor capital of
Europe with more fabrication plants than any other country.
</P>
<P>
The UK now boasts half of all the investment in Europe by South
Korean companies, and Britain attracts 40 percent of all inward
investment into Europe.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major, in welcoming the LG
announcement, said: "Wales won against fierce competition in
Europe. It is a tribute to the Welsh workforce and a vote of
confidence in the UK economy."
</P>
<P>
The project by LG, South Korea's second-largest industrial
conglomerate which employs 126,000 people worldwide, will more
than double South Korean industrial investments in the UK to 2.6
billion pounds (4 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the project is part of the company's plan
to locate more plants abroad to escape high wages in South Korea
and avoid possible trade barriers in overseas markets.

<HEADLINE> Yemen Pays Growing Attention to Population Problem, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni Deputy Premier and Minister
of Planning and Development Abdul Qader Bagammal has said that
this country is according growing attention to the tackling of
various aspects of the population problem.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion of the World Population Day Thursday,
addressing a ceremony organized by the Secretariat of the Yemeni
Population Council in Sanaa, Bagammal, also deputy chairman of the
Population Council, said the population problem in this country
has become one of the basic national issues ever since the
proclamation of unity in 1990.
</P>
<P>
According to official Yemeni sources, the population of Yemen
at midday July 11, 1996, stood at 16,648,873, a rate of increase
of 3.7 percent, which is one of the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
This rate of increase means an addition of 3,849,641 people by
the turn of the century, as the population of Yemen in the year
2000 is estimated to reach 19,654,245, and by the year 2013 to
some 31,609,308 people.
</P>
<P>
Such figures constitute an extremely serious indication,
namely, Yemen is approaching a great population explosion in just
a few years, whereas, some developed countries have reached the
stage of diminishing population.
</P>
<P>
On his part, the Yemeni Population Council Secretary General
said that this rate of increase necessitates the doubling of the
national income to meet the doubling of the population, besides
the doubling of housing, roads, seats in schools and universities,
and beds in hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Experts are warning that such population increase will
certainly create a difficult situation that will negatively affect
the country's basic resources as well as health, social and
educational services.
</P>
<P>
It will also lead to further deterioration of the unemployment
problem, poverty, disease and environmental pollution. These
problems, damaging as they are to human beings and the land, will
lead the country to an inevitable disaster which will be difficult
to surmount, they said.

BAGHDAD, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraq and Turkey signed here
Thursday a minute of economic and trade cooperation between the
two countries before a large Turkish delegation ended its visit to
Iraq today.
</P>
<P>
The minute of cooperation includes ways of reactivating trade
and economic exchange between the two countries in the fields of
trade, finance, agriculture, industry, oil, transport and
communications.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the signing ceremony, Iraqi Trade Ministry
Undersecretary Hatam Afl-Samarra'i expressed Iraq's keenness on
developing trade relations with Turkey and expanding activities in
all areas.
</P>
<P>
Adviser of Turkish foreign trade relations Najat Arn, who heads
a 110-member delegation on a visit to Iraq, described the minute
as a "positive step" which will result in opening new aspects of
cooperation and great chance for Turkish trade activities in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Arn added that the minute indicated the joint interest by the
two sides to enhance their relations and resume the plans and
programs which stopped during the nearly six-year U.N. trade
embargo imposed on Iraq after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The current political climate in
the subcontinent is favorable for India and Pakistan to solve
their outstanding mutual issues including Kashmir, said the U.S.
Ambassador to India, Frank Wisner, here today.
</P>
<P>
"The present moves between the two countries are favorable, the
prime ministers sending one another signals adds to this favorable
disposition," said the ambassador regarding the settlement of
Kashmir at a press briefing.
</P>
<P>

the two governments can be developed, a consensus can be reached,"

Minister Benazir Bhutto, who sent that signal to New Delhi and New
Delhi responded quickly to that signal," he noted.
</P>

engaging in talks."
</P>
<P>
The United States, he said, is pleased with the prospects of
re-commencement of talks between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"The view of the U.S. is that Kashmir cries out for a
settlement and that settlement can best be achieved if it is
pursued as a matter of exchange and dialogue between India and
Pakistan and if the will of the people of Jammu and Kashmir is
also taken into account."
</P>
<P>
Wisner denied that the U.S. views regarding Kashmir have
undergone a change.
</P>
<P>
"Our views have not changed, that remains the clearest
description of the American policy, we would like to see Kashmir
move out of violence where there have been incalculable
sufferings, we would like to see Kashmir on the path that leads to
peace and an end to violence in the valley."

When asked about the U.S. role in the resolution of Kashmir
issue, he said: "of course we will try to be helpful in any manner
whatever it is if there is a strong statement of help from both
sides to get on to an agreement."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Retail Sales Decline by 0.2 Percent in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The retail sales in the United
States dropped by 0.2 percent in June, the second decline in three
months and the largest in eight months.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales in the country declined to 205.2 billion dollars
in June from 205.5 billion in May, the Department of Commerce
reported today.
</P>
<P>
In comparison, retails saw a healthy gain of 0.8 percent in May
and a slight drop of 0.1 percent in April.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the decline in retail sales, which represent about
a third of the U.S. economic activity, was resulted from a heavy
debt burden on the consumers who cut back on auto and department
store purchases.
</P>
<P>
In June, auto sales in the United States fell by 1.4 percent,
nearly reversing a 1.8 percent gain in May, and department store
purchases, which gained by 1.2 percent in May, declined by 0.4
percent, the worst in three months.
</P>
<P>
The only signs of strength were at restaurants and bars, where
receipts rose 0.5 percent, and at building supply and hardware
stores, where sales rose 1.2 percent on top of a 1.4 percent May
gain.
</P>
<P>
Analysts hold that the lackluster sales pattern reflects a
slowdown in borrowing by consumers.
</P>
<P>
Consumer debt in April and May rose at the most sluggish rate
in three years, according to a recent report by the U.S. Federal
Reserve. U.S. bankers also reported that credit card
delinquencies in the January-March quarter was at their highest
level in 14 years.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thailand's Beer Industry to Further Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's brewing industry has
bright prospects as beer consumption in the country continues to
grow.
</P>
<P>
The local brewing industry has recorded steady growth in recent
years, with beer sales increasing by an average of 25.6 percent
between 1992 and 1995, according to a study by the Thai Farmers
Research Center Co.
</P>
<P>
Total sales in 1995 alone topped 30 billion baht (1.2 billion
US dollars) and are projected to reach 38 billion (1.52 billion
dollars) this year.
</P>
<P>
With a per capita beer consumption in Thailand at 10 liters a
year, there is an ample room for expansion. Drinkers in Hong Kong,
Singapore and Taiwan consume 30-40 liters of beer per year.
</P>
<P>
Strong market growth would draw more foreign brewers,
especially from Europe and the United States where the beer market
is saturated, and existing brewers will soon be forced to raise
output and lower costs to cope with this competition.
</P>
<P>
Beer consumption growth has been spurred by several factors,
among them the increased buying power of the consumers, and even
many low-income earners, especially those in rural areas, have
stopped buying cheap liquor in favor of beer.
</P>
<P>
A strong tourism industry, with 6 million tourists coming to
the country each year, consumes much of the country's beer.
</P>
<P>
Besides, health-conscious consumers prefer beer and wine to
hard liquor at dinner table.
</P>
<P>
Thailand now has five major brewers. Boonrawd Brewery Co.,
which markets Singha brand, is the country's first and largest
brewer with an 80 percent market share.
</P>
<P>
Other brewers include Thai Amarit, Carlsberg, Thai Asia Pacific
and Beer Thai.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's fast-growing market has also attracted many foreign
beers. Among them are Corona brand, which currently holds a 67
percent share of the foreign beer market, and Miller, which holds
20 percent.

<HEADLINE> 100-Year Rainfall Record Set in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Rainfall in China's largest city
of Shanghai has been the heaviest in this year's rainy season
since records began over a century ago.
</P>
<P>
Total rainfall in the coastal city since June 3 when the rainy
season began has so far reached 535 millimeters ( and it's still
raining!).
</P>
<P>
The previous record downpour was in 1875 when the rainfall
level reached 534.5 mm. Records only started a few years before
that.
</P>
<P>
The municipal meteorological observatory says that the
rainfall is the highest since records began.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that the rain belt has been hovering above
Shanghai this year, and influencing the city's July temperature.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the average temperature in the first ten
days of this July stood at 25 degrees centigrade, 1.4 degrees
centigrade lower than the average in previous years.
</P>
<P>
Since late June, Shanghai has witnessed four rainstorms,
causing problems for vegetable-growing farmers.

<HEADLINE> France Asks U.S. to Suspend Some Clauses in Helm-Burton Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- France today called on the United
States to "make a gesture of appeasement" by suspending some
clauses in the Helms-Burton Act, which was used for the first time
this week by Washington to reinforce trade embargo against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
"The President of the United States still has the possibility
at his disposal to suspend the application of some layouts of this
law. This would make up a gesture of appeasement," said Jacques
Rummelhardt, spokesman of the French Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
He added that "at all events, the implementation of these
measures, which represent serious deviations from the
international norm, could not stay without reaction."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government used the Helms-Burton Act on Wednesday
against a Canadian company which has trade relations with the
Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Burton Act prohibits the entry into the U.S.
territory heads of foreign companies which have taken advantage of
Cuba's state-owned assets or the assets that used to belong to
Cubans now living in exile in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will decide by July 15 whether to annul clause 3 of the
act, which allows U.S. citizens to sue foreign companies making
profits from the assets that used to belong to them in Cuba.
Experts say that if this clause is put into work, U.S. courts can
fine foreign companies tens of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
Rummelhardt warned that if this clause is used by the United
States against any one of the European Union members, European
countries will make collective reprisals against the United States.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the U.S. sanctions against the Canadian firm
is "an extra step in the bad direction" which contradicted with
the commitments made by the Group of Seven (G-7) industrialized
nations at their summit in Lyon, France, late last month.
</P>
<P>
The G-7 nations agreed at the summit not to resort to measures
that contradict with the rules of the World Trade Organization and
the code of the Organization of Economic Cooperation and
Development.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher said on
Wednesday that although the U.S. government was worried about the
strong reaction from its allies against the act, Washington had no
choice.

<HEADLINE> Youngest Peking Man 410,000 Years Old (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The site has been inscribed on the World Heritage list by the
United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The sample dated was from the upper layer of the limestone
caverns, where the skull of the youngest Peking Man was found.
</P>
<P>
His skull was pieced up by fragments of fossils
that matched, which were unearthed in 1934 and 1966, separately.
</P>
<P>
From 1992-95, scientists applied thermal ionization mass
spectrometry to dating the samples, using principles of chemistry
and nuclear physics. After three years of intensive research they
have made the new discovery that the sample -- Young Peking Man --
lived some 410,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The scientists say that with the new method they have achieved
an improvement in sensitivity and precision of up to 100-times
better over the previously used traditional radiation-measuring
methods.
</P>
<P>
The increased sensitivity also means that less material is
required for analysis, they say.
</P>
<P>
According to Yuan Zhenxin, it is the first time the new method
has been applied in dating finds from early Paleolithic Age.
</P>
<P>
"The mass spectrometry technique, as applied to dating samples,
is making a significant impact on refining Pleistocene
chronology," he says. The scientists now plan to use the method to
date older Peking Man... wondering whether he is older than they
thought!

<HEADLINE> India to Host Infrastructure Development Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Asia-Pacific ministerial
conference on infrastructure development will be held in New Delhi
in October this year.
</P>
<P>
A host country agreement was signed here today by Indian
ambassador to Thailand and Indian permanent representative to the
United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the
Pacific (ESCAP), Ranjit Gupta, and Executive Secretary of ESCAP,
Adrianus Mooy.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of the conference is to launch the New Delhi
action plan in infrastructure development (1997-2006) adopted in
May last year, and to enhance collective commitment of ESCAP
members to develop infrastructure and address obstacles.
</P>
<P>
The conference will focus on the following five issues:
infrastructure policy and planning, public-private sector
partnership, improving facilitation measures of efficient movement
of international transport, contribution of infrastructure to
poverty alleviation and human development, and environmental
concerns.
</P>
<P>
The conference will consist of a senior officials segment
(October 23-26), followed by the ministerial-level segment
(October 28-29). on October 30, the world infrastructure forum
will begin a two-day session to foster discussion on the
partnership between the private sector and the national
governments.
</P>
<P>
Lack of infrastructure hinders economic and social development
in the Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
An ESCAP study shows that the region needs to invest some 1,500
billion US dollars in additional regional infrastructure
development before the turn of the century to sustain and
strengthen the current growth pattern.
</P>
<P>
However, only 500 billion dollars is available or already
committed for infrastructure development in the region.

<HEADLINE> Yellow River Resumes Flow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- China's mighty Yellow River has
started to flow again, after setting a new record -- for being
totally dry in its lower reaches for 128 days.
</P>
<P>
By this morning the flow volume at the Lijin Station, the last
hydrometric station on the lower reaches of the river, stood at
0.5 cubic meters per second.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the State Flood Control and Drought-Relief
Headquarters warned today that "water resources should be
treasured in China in a country insufficient in water."
</P>
<P>
Lingering droughts in north China, starting last autumn and
increasing irrigating projects on both sides of the river, caused
the stoppage of flow in the lower reaches of the river from
February 14.
</P>
<P>
The stoppage caused great difficulties for farming and
industrial production and people's lives in the region.
</P>
<P>
This spring, the State Flood Control and Drought-Relief
Headquarters twice managed to divert water from reservoirs on the
upper reaches of the river, in a bid to alleviate the shortage of
water in the lower reaches of the river.
</P>
<P>
This year's dry-river spell is six days longer than that of
last year, which itself was a historical record.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Finance Minister Says No More Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Finance Minister Mohie
Eddin al-Gharib has given the Egyptian taxpayers a piece of good
news by promising that there would be no more taxes.
</P>
<P>
The minister has tried hard to convince the limited-income
class and government employees that there would be no more taxes
in the foreseeable future, which will also be warmly welcomed by
investors and businessmen, according to local press today.
</P>
<P>
Al-Gharib said that the Ministry of Finance was not tied to a
policy pressing for the collection of as many taxes as possible.
"Contrary to this mistaken conception, as soon as I assumed
office, I reduced customs fees imposed on basic commodities by 60
to 70 percent," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Even though the minister was repeatedly reminded of the annual
budget deficit, he refused to withdraw his promises. He said that
"I hope the budget deficit (1.6 percent) will not cause any worry."
</P>
<P>
he noted that "we are trying to reduce the budget deficit to
1.5 percent of the total domestic output."
</P>
<P>
Al-Gharib, dismissing the fears about the budget deficit as
groundless, said that the annual budget deficit in France reached
5 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government was trying to reduce the budget
deficit by cutting the expenditure of the ministries, which will
be centered at controlling the increase of new employees in
government offices.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the majority of Egyptians, who are identified as a
limited-income class, the minister also promised that there would
be no price rise on the cheap bread.
</P>
<P>
Heavy-smokers, who stubbornly ignore warnings about the dangers
of smoking, are also promised that there would be no price
increase on tobacco.

<HEADLINE> More Swiss Prefer Not to Get Married </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland saw the number of
marriages drop further by four percent in 1995 compared to 1994,
the Swiss Federal Office for Statistics (BFS) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The latest statistics by the BFS showed that only 40,800 pairs
got married in 1995, down from 42,400 in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The BFS attributed the situation to the loss of traditional
family value, saying that more and more pairs lived together long
before they decided to be husbands and wifes.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, an increasing number of people choose to remain
single, with about 42 percent of single men and 38 percent of
single women never trying marriage, said the BFS.
</P>
<P>
As for the number of divorces, the BFS observed a slow-down in
1995 for the first time since 1990. About 15,700 couples divorced
in 1995, up only 0.4 percent from 1994.
</P>
<P>
The statistics also showed that about 82,200 children were born
in 1995, down slightly from 83,000 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The birth-rate last year was an all-time low in the country,
with each woman producing only 1.47. Excluding foreign women
living in Switzerland, each Swiss woman had on average only 1.31
babies.
</P>
<P>
Also in 1995, a total of 63,400 people died, 80 percent of them
having reached retiring ages, and half of them above 80.
</P>
<P>
The life expectancy for men was 75.3 years and 81.7 years for
women in Switzerland, the BFS added.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
today demanded tougher measures to fight terrorism in Moscow,
which was hit by two bomb explosions within just two days.
</P>
<P>
Addressing senior officials of the Federal Security Service,
Yeltsin noted that the fight against terrorism and the enacting of
anti-terrorism measures were one of the top tasks of the security
institutions.
</P>
<P>
The terrorism acts, staged in Moscow during the past two days,
"show that terrorists have not been cleared of Moscow," Yeltsin
said, adding that "tougher measures should be taken" against them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin is
heading a special task force to investigate the explosions, his
spokesman Viktor Konnov told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Today's explosion, at 08:20 Moscow time in Prospect Mira (Peace
avenue) in northern Moscow, killed one and wounded 22 others.
</P>
<P>
The front side of a trolleybus was completely ruined by the
explosive device twice as powerful as the one which went off in
another trolleybus in the capital Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's bomb went off at about 09:00 local time near the
Russia Movie Theater and ripped apart the front of trolleybus
No. 12 on the Pushkin Square, injuring the driver and four
others.

<HEADLINE> Youngest Peking Man 410,000 Years Old (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Young Peking Man is older than
previously thought, say scientists from China, the United States
and Canada.
</P>
<P>
They have dated the youngest Peking Man living in a cave in
the southwestern suburbs of Beijing to 410,000 years ago,
180,000 years older than previously believed.
</P>
<P>
The new find breaks the traditional view that the Asian
ape-man, typified by Peking Man, was slower to evolve than his
African cousins.
</P>
<P>
Current assumptions are based on the belief that there were few
constitutional differences between the oldest Peking Man,
460,000-year-old, and the youngest, 230,000-year-old -- pointing
to an evolutionary period spanning over 200,000 years. But the
methods used to carry out the old dating was less advanced than
new methods.
</P>
<P>
More sophisticated equipment has enabled scientists from two
continents to pinpoint with greater accuracy the age differences
between old and young Peking Man. The new thinking points to
Peking Man and his African counterparts evolving more or less at
the same rate.
</P>
<P>
The new find will appear as a leading article in the August
1996 issue of the journal Acta Anthropologica Sinca, published by
the Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology
(IVPP), under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The find was made by Professor Shen Guanjun from the University
of Guizhou in southwest China's Guizhou province, associate
research fellow Yuan Zhenxin from IVPP, and two scientists from
the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
They made the discovery by dating the limestone caverns in
which Peking Man dwelled at Zhoukoudian.
</P>
<P>
In excavations that began in 1927, archaeologists and
paleontologists recovered the remains of at least 40 individuals
belonging to a hominid species that used fire and crudely
fashioned stone tools, but was anatomically distinct from Homo
sapiens.

<HEADLINE> China Red Cross Donates 600,000 Yuan To Flood Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Red Cross Society of China has
donated 600,000 yuan to Anhui, Zhejiang and Guizhou provinces in
southern China to help aid families hit by the serious floods.
</P>
<P>
Liu Dewang, director of Social Service &AMP; Disaster Relief
Department with the non-official organization, said that each of
the three provinces will get 200,000 yuan, half of which is
earmarked for the purchase of grain, with the the rest for buying
medicine.
</P>
<P>
He explained that Jiangxi Province did not get funding from the
RCSC because it suffered the least damage in the recent floods
among the four provinces.
</P>
<P>
Liu told Xinhua that the local red cross society in Anhui has
already spent 250,000 yuan buying medicines and warm bedding.
</P>
<P>
Liu, who has just returned from relief work in Anhui, said that
four spells of torrential rain hit Anhui between June 17 and July
4, resulting in a flood that has affected seven million people,
more than one-tenth of the total population of the province.
</P>
<P>
"While the flood occured in the northern part of Anhui in the
Huaihe River Valley in 1991, the flood this year has affected the
southern part of Anhui Province, south of the Yangtze River," he
said.
</P>
<P>
By July 5 more than 600,000 people were overwhelmed by the
floods, 110,000 people were made homeless, 56 died, and 27,000
people were either injured or made ill by the floods.
</P>
<P>
"The weather is humid and of high temperature," he said. "The
air is filthy because of rotting bodies of livestock in some
areas."
</P>
<P>
310,000 hectares of land has been affected by the flooding,
with over 20,000 ha of farmland destroyed. Meanwhile, 90,000
houses collapsed, and more than 200,000 houses were damaged but
still habitable.
</P>
<P>
Anhui's direct economic loss has mounted to nearly 10 billion
Yuan.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by the Ministry of Civil
Affairs 20.7 million people in China had been affected by floods
by July 4, with 237 people died.
</P>
<P>
The floods have destroyed 221,000 houses, damaged more than
half a million other homes, and trapped 2.16 million people.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that more than 440 people had died in the
floods by July 10.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that China's floods have aroused wide concern from the
international community.
</P>
<P>
Red Cross societies in Hong Kong and Taiwan have donated
600,000 yuan and 200,000 US dollars respectively. Liu said that he
was informed yesterday that the Red Cross society of Japan has
promised to donate 13.8 million Japanese Yen for disaster relief
in China.
</P>
<P>
"Some embassies in China have either sent staff in person or
telephoned to inquire about the disaster situation in China,
expressing sympathy for the flood victims," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government announced on July 9 that it will donate
300,000 US dollars of cash and 300,000 US Dollars-worth of
disaster relief goods.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Population Grows to 4 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Despite the chaotic accounts of
the country's population, the Lebanese authorities are still
reluctant to conduct a census, fearing any serious attempt to
count the population would reincarnate the ghost of civil war.
</P>
<P>
The statistics are in such a mess that when any Lebanese
walking along Hamra Street, the trade center in Ras Beirut, is
intercepted and asked the question, the number which he put must
dramatically differ from that given by the man walking beside
him.
</P>
<P>
Currently, there are six influential estimates of Lebanon's
population and the differences between them are quite large.
</P>
<P>
The Arab Monetary Fund estimated Lebanon's population at 2.7
million, and the United Nations put the number at 2.9 million.
</P>
<P>
A study by the privately-owned Saint Joseph University
concluded the population at 3.1 million, And the Arab Institution
for Guaranteeing Investments estimated that Lebanon has 3.5
million people.
</P>
<P>
The population jumps to 3.9 million according to the estimates
of the Lebanese Financial Ministry and to 4 million according to
the estimates of the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The last census was manipulated by the French mandatory
authorities in 1932, based on which the 1943 National Pact, the
first constitution of the Republic of Lebanon, was drawn,
defining the principle of a representation of the communities "in
an equitable manner."
</P>
<P>
The 1932 census gave a numerical superiority to the Maronite
Catholics followed by the Muslim Sunnis, then Muslim Shiites, and
it was on this basis that the political hierarchy of castes was
established in the Lebanese social mosaic made up of 17 religious
and sectarian communities.
</P>
<P>
Thus the Maronite caste is entitled to the presidency of the
Republic, the Sunni caste to the premiership and the Shiite to
the post of parliament speaker.
</P>
<P>
The seats in the parliament were also proportionally assigned
to various communities, basically six to Christians and five to
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Since then no single official census was taken ever thanks to
the inherent flaw in the National Pact principle that any
demographic change, which a census will inevitably expose,
necessarily means a change in the ranking of the politically
hierarchic castes.
</P>
<P>
In order to put an end to the ruthless 15-year civil war,
Lebanese parliamentarians gathered in Taif, Saudi Arabia, in 1989
and worked out an agreement of national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Though failing to overthrow the fixed pattern of the so-called
"three presidencies," or "Toika," the Taif accord did achieve a
slight modification in the political structure.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing a change in Lebanese population in favor of the
Muslims, the Taif accord stated that all seats in the Parliament,
as well as portfolios in the cabinet, would be equally
distributed between Muslims and Christians, while taking into
consideration the proportions of the various castes.
</P>
<P>
So the 1992 parliament became the first
half-Christian-half-Muslim one in the republic's history, with 27
of the totally 128 seats allocated to Sunnis, 27 to Shiites,
eight to Druzes, two to Allawis, 34 to Maronites, 14 to Greek
Orthodoxes, eight to Greek Catholics, five to Armenian Orthodoxes,
one to Armenian Catholics, one to Protestants and one to other
minorities.
</P>
<P>
Being a pragmatically effective way to avoid political
turbulence, the reluctance to conduct a census has become an
obstacle to solving social and economic problems, some Lebanese
complained.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the Beirut-based An-Nahar daily said that the lack
of a unified statistics on the population has made the
feasibility of the government's reconstruction plans
questionable.
</P>
<P>
The conservative daily put as an example the varied judgements
about how many houses the Lebanese people will need by the end of
this century.
</P>
<P>
The Housing Ministry expects Lebanon will need 300,000 housing
units by the year 2000, while the U.N. Economic and Social
Committee for West Asia (ESCWA) estimates the need at 360,000
units by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
The Council for Development and Reconstruction (CDR), the
government's institution to execute its ambitious reconstruction
plans, asserted that the demand will come up to 535,400 housing
units in the next four years.
</P>
<P>
An-Nahar noted that independent researchers have estimated that
the number could even rise to 700,000 units.

<HEADLINE> NPC Vice-Chairman Urges Legislation on Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior official of the National
People's Congress, China's top legislature, has called for
speedier drafting of environmental protection laws.
</P>
<P>
Wang Bingqian, vice-chairman of the NPC Standing Committee,
said in an article in today's People's Daily that the nation's
environmental problems are serious, urban pollution problems are
getting worse, and that pollution has begun to spread to rural
areas. These must be solved by more environmental protection laws,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
He added that the reduction in the amount of cultivated land,
the destruction of forests, degeneration of prairies, shortage of
water resources, and lack of mineral reserves are becoming worse
in China. He pointed out that if these problems are not solved,
they will threaten people's lives and hinder the country's future
economic development.
</P>
<P>
Wang emphasised that environmental protection laws should lay
equal stress on prevention, control of pollution, and protection
of natural resources, and urged the drafting of a general law that
could be the basis for other more specialized laws.
</P>
<P>
He also called for drafting of specialized laws that deal with
the nation's economy and people's daily lives, such as those
controlling noise pollution, radioactive wastes, toxic chemicals.
</P>
<P>
Local environmental protection regulations are an important
part of setting up the country's legal system, Wang said, calling
for formulation of laws that help fulfill obligations in
international environmental conventions.
</P>
<P>
China has joined more than 20 environmental conventions.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that a national conference is to be held in
Beijing From July 15 to 17 on environmental protection.

<P>
CAIRO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The resolution of the Jerusalem
issue and Jerusalem's return to Palestinian sovereignty are the
basis of the process of political settlement in the Middle East, a
senior Palestinian official said today.
</P>
<P>
Hanan Ashrawi, Minister of Higher Education in the Palestinian
Authority, told the Egyptian "Sawt al Arab" (Voice of the Arabs)
radio that Israel was aimed at eradicating the Christian and
Islamic Arab presence through its policy of Judaizing the holy
city.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Minister said that the process of political
settlement in general was being exposed to danger on account of
the new Israeli government's attempt to undermine and change the
principles entrenched in the 1991 Madrid conference on peace in
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
She reaffirmed the commitment of the Palestinian side to the
peace process in accordance with the recent Arab summit
resolutions and in conformity with the prerequisites of just and
comprehensive peace.
</P>
<P>
Ashrawi said: "we are committed to peace so long as the Israeli
side remains committed to international resolutions and the
agreements already reached between the Palestinians and Israelis."
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians are calling for a sovereign and independent
state with its capital in east Jerusalem -- the half of the city
Israel annexed after the 1967 Middle East war and declared part of
its "eternal, undivided capital."

<HEADLINE> China Prosecutors Handle 26,667 Corruption Cases in Five Months (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Chinese prosecutors have handled
26,667 economic crimes of corruption and embezzlement during the
first five months this year, including investigations of 1,151
party and government officials above the county-head level.
</P>
<P>
The total represents a seven percent rise in economic crimes
over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
More than 1.5 billion yuan (180.7 million US dollars) of direct
state and collective economic losses were recovered from these
cases, an increase of 34.4 percent from the same period in 1995,
said Liang Guoqing, deputy procurator-general of the Supreme
People's Procuratorate, who was speaking at a national work
conference today.
</P>
<P>
"Procuratorial bodies have centered their efforts on `major and
important' corruption cases, and have made marked new progress in
the fight to uncover corrupt officials and crack major cases in
the first half of this year," he said.
</P>
<P>
There were 17,261 high-level corruption cases reported in the
January-May period, involving more than 10,000 yuan each, up 22
percent from the first five months in 1995, Liang said.
</P>
<P>
To ensure swift and severe punishment for the criminals, 12,964
people involved in 10,516 cases of corruption, embezzlement and
abuse of power for personal interests were brought to court during
the five-month time frame, Liang said.
</P>
<P>
"The massive and forceful crackdowns on corruption and crimes
involving important figures and large sums of money have
effectively frightened the criminals, educated the cadres and
encouraged the public's enthusiasm toward participating in the
fight against such illegal activities," he said.
</P>
<P>
To date, citizens have provided authorities with leads in
164,000 cases of corruption, 26.9 percent more than during the
corresponding time in 1995.

<P>
Liang pledged to continue the anti-corruption fight against the
"major and important" offenders, as the number of cases
successfully prosecuted "truly indicates the progress of this
fight."
</P>
<P>
He urged the procuratorial departments to investigate fields
such as finance and securities, real estate, and building
contracting.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the anti-corruption drive, China's procuratorial
bodies also made significant progress in reining in crimes that
affect the public order, state security, and the supervision of
law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
During the five-month period, prosecutors arrested 245,000
suspects, filed charges against 219,000, and prosecuted 3,700.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Global System Urged to Curb Flow of Chemicals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Representatives attending a
conference on international chemical control communications here
today called for creation of a global information exchange system
to control the flow of chemicals into the illicit drug traffic.
</P>
<P>
Recognizing that chemicals obtained from legitimate sources are
critical to the illicit drug production in the world and the
commerce in chemicals is of global scope, the participants
stressed the importance of information exchanges on trade in those
chemicals that could be used to manufacture drugs.
</P>
<P>
According to the organizers of the conference, the participants
have agreed upon some immediate steps to be taken to curb
chemicals, including sending "specific alert" to each other on
shipments of chemicals, and informing the relevant United Nations
bodies before the shipments occur.
</P>
<P>
The three-day conference, which closed today, was co-hosted by
the US Drug Enforcement Administration and Thai Office of the
Narcotics Control Board. Some 50 law enforcement and regulatory
officials from 18 countries and regions attended the conference.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the UN International Drug Control Program
were also present at the event.

<HEADLINE> China to Authenticate Standards for Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- China plans to establish a State
Guidance Committee for Environment Management Authentication in an
effort to introduce official standards for environmental
protection.
</P>
<P>
Xie Zhenhua, director of the National Environmental Protection
Agency (NEPA), said the move is an effort to "conform to
international trends and improve environment management and
sustain social and economic development."
</P>
<P>
In 1993, the International Standardization Organization (ISO)
set up the Environment Management Technology Committee to regulate
the influence of environmental protection within enterprises and
institutions, and their production and services, by establishing
international standards of operation (ISO 14000), the director said.
</P>
<P>
"China will turn the ISO 14000 into the country's national
standards for environment management in an opportune time," Xie said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference jointly held by NEPA and The
State Technological Supervision Bureau (STSB), Xie said
implementation of the standards will be help save energy, reduce
materials, and encourage clean and cost-efficient
production. These efforts will reduce waste discharged from the
production and also help cut back on hazardous pollution problems,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Li Chuanqing, STSB director, said the standards will exert
positive effects on economic development, technological exchange
and trade throughout the world.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Declares War: Palestinian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 12 (Xinhua) -- In reference to Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks to the U.S. Congress on
Jerusalem, a senior Palestinian official has said that Netanyahu
made a "declaration of war."
</P>
<P>
Today's English-language newspaper the Jerusalem Post quoted
Faisal Husseini, who holds the Jerusalem portfolio in the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA), as saying that "If he
(Netanyahu) is saying that there will be no negotiations (on
Jerusalem), we see this as a declaration of war."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who is currently in the U.S. on his first official
visit since he assumed power last month, told a joint session of
the U.S. Congress that Jerusalem would remain exclusively under
Israeli rule, stressing that the city would "never be
redivided again."
</P>
<P>
Husseini said the speech raised concern about Israel's
commitment to keeping the Oslo accords with the Palestinians,
and continuing final stage negotiations, which include the issue
of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
However, he indicated that final judgment would be withheld
and the Palestinians would wait to see how the Israeli
premier's statements on Jerusalem and other issues are
translated into policy.
</P>
<P>
He said Netanyahu was "entitled to his opinion," as long as it
did not mean that there would be no negotiations on Jerusalem as
the Oslo accords signed in September 1993 calls for such bargainings.
</P>
<P>
when asked what the PNA expected from the Israeli prime
minister, Husseini answered: "Final stage negotiations must
resume immediately,"
</P>
<P>
Also in response to Netanyahu's speech, PNA President Yasser
Arafat told reporters in the Gaza Strip Thursday that "Al-Guds
Al-Sherif (holy Jerusalem) is the capital of Palestine forever."
</P>
<P>
"Peace is not only a Palestinian need, but also an
Israeli need and an international need," said Arafat, who has
just returned from a visit to Morocco.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's spokesman Marwan Kanafani told the Arabic newspaper
Al-Guds that "it is a pity that Netanyahu is trying to
gain sympathy of the (U.S.) Congress by lying" about Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian Council member from the West Bank Hanan
Ashrawi said that the clapping of the Congress over Netanyahu's
Jerusalem remarks showed "once again domestic concerns have
superimposed themselves on international law."
</P>
<P>
However, she said she believed this would change after the
U.S. presidential elections in November.

<HEADLINE> Moderates Mediate Dispute in UPC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Moderates in the Uganda People's
Congress (UPC) met yesterday separately with James Rwanyarare and
Mrs Ceicilia Ogwal, leaders of two rival factions within this main
opposition party to mediate their dispute.
</P>
<P>
"The New Vision" today reported that both Rwanyarare and Mrs
Ogwal did not say any word when contacted for comment, while
engineer Darlington Sakwa, the main mediator, also refused to
reveal the detail of the meetings.
</P>
<P>
But Sakwa said that he would release a press statement later.
</P>
<P>
Reliable sources from the UPC were quoted as saying that
reconciliation was possible and under consideration.
</P>
<P>
They said at the party headquarters here that Rwanyarare group
had a day-long meeting yesterday and decided to form a six-member
reconciliatory committee with each side having three.
</P>
<P>
When a meeting chaired by Mrs Ogwal was under way, Ben Wacha,
a member of Ogwal group said, "so far there are no irreversible
trends in all the events that have occurred."
</P>
<P>
The crisis was sparked off when twice-deposed leader Milton
Obote, UPC president now in Zambia, appointed Rwanyarare to
replace Mrs Ogwal as de facto leader at home following her
decision to contest the just concluded parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Later, Mrs Ogwal and her supporters formed an interim
Executive Council to run the party.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here said the pro-Obote faction led by Rwanyarare
has UPC heavy weights on its side while the Ogwal faction has
sizeable support from the youth who want to see a change in the
party.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Hopes to Talk with Cameroon over Bakassi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria is still hopeful of a
meeting between Head of State General Sani Abacha and Cameroonian
President Paul Biya over the Bakassi dispute despite last month's
failure of talks in Togo.
</P>
<P>
At present Nigeria is still looking forward to such a meeting
to find a peaceful solution to the long-drawn dispute over the
oil-rich Bakassi peninsula, Nigeria's Foreign Affairs Minister
Tom Ikimi said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi was in Yaounde, capital of Cameroon, to attend the 32nd
session of the Organization of African Unity summit, which ended
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The minister told Nigerian reporters covering the summit that
there had been a lot of preparations to ensure that the meeting
of the two heads of state holds.
</P>
<P>
Since the June 19 Togo meeting, brokered by Togoless President
Gnassingbe Eyadema, could not take place due to the failure of
president Biya to attend the meeting, Nigeria has not given up
hope of a dialogue between the two countries, Ikimi said.
</P>
<P>
To find a permanent solution to the age-long boundary dispute
between the two countries, Nigeria has carried out a
reconnaissance survey of the entire area in dispute, according to
Major General Abdul Kareem Adisa, Minister of Works and Housing.
</P>
<P>
''The ministry carried out reconnaissance survey and field
completion of 69 quarter sheets at scale 1:50,000, covering the
entire length of 1,680 km of Nigeria-Cameroon boundary from the
tripoint in Chad republic to the gulf of Guinea,'' the minister
said.
</P>
<P>
The measure was to ensure accurate and unambiguous delineation
of the boundary, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the military said the country would not concede any
land in the Bakassi peninsula.
</P>
<P>
''I wish to reassure you that no land will be taken away from
us in the Bakassi peninsula. Everything about the issue is being
handled by the government. We are firmly in control of the
situation there,'' defense spokesman Brigadier General Fred
Chijuka said Thursday in a TV program in Lagos.

<HEADLINE> Striking Nairobi Employees Ordered To Return To </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 12 (Xinhua) -- 17,000 Striking workers of
Nairobi City Council have been ordered to return to their post
this morning or face immediate dismissal.
</P>
<P>
Town Clerk Hezron Oluoch said last night he instructed all
those employees on strike to report immediately to their duty
stations at 8 am on Friday, and if failed to do so they would
face immediate dismissal.
</P>
<P>
The 17,000 Nairobi City Council workers started their strike
on Wednesday, demanding 395 million Kenya shillings (about 6.5
million U.S. dollars) in salary arrears.
</P>
<P>
The worst-hit sector was the garbage collection department, as
the workers barricaded roads using garbage, turning the city's
clean roads into rot and stench ones.
</P>
<P>
The busy Ngong and Valley roads were rendered near-impassable
by garbage, resulting in long traffic jams.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the second day of the strike, the rioting workers
stormed a hotel owned by Nairobi Mayor John King'ori and caused
extensive damage, smashing furniture and windows. The city center
was thrown into a state of fear and confusion with anti-riot
police engaging striking workers in day-long running battle.
</P>
<P>
The Town Clerk said that the employees, by engaging in the
strike have breached rules and regulations governing their
employment.
</P>
<P>
On the payment of the arrears demanded by the workers, Hezron
Oluoch said the matter could only be effectively addressed after
their resumption of duty.

KAMPALA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Uganda National Environmental
Management Authority has decided to erect barriers and booms to
contain the water hyacinth on Lake Victoria, reported the local

</P>
<P>
Executive Director John Okedi and head of Information and

institutions and concerned individuals to participate.
</P>
<P>
The floating water hyacinth has since 1992 spread at alarming
rates. The weeds have now strangled 90 percent of the shoreline
of rivers and lakes, a stretch of about 2,000 kilometers.
</P>

The weeds are covering all bays of Lake Victoria, Lake Kyoga,
River Nile in Uganda and, to a small extent Lake Albert. The

GUANGZHOU, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Seven hospitals in Guangzhou,
the capital of south China's Guangdong Province, have begun to
provide outpatient care for people who are having great financial
difficulties.

<HEADLINE> China to Reduce Water Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- China plans to give top priority
to reducing water pollution in its worst polluted rivers and lakes
during the 1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
The rivers are the Huaihe in central and east China, the Haihe
in the north, and the Liaohe in the northeast. The lakes are the
Taihu in Jiangsu Province, the Chaohu in Anhui, and the Dianchi in
Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
Water pollution controls are high on the agenda of the Fourth
National Environmental Protection Meeting, scheduled for July
15-17.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the National Environmental Protection Agency
(NEPA) say that "water pollution is an enormous problem in China,
and reducing water pollution is an urgent task."
</P>
<P>
Nearly half of the country's seven largest rivers are seriously
polluted, especially the Huaihe, and about 50 percent of the water
in its 191 tributaries is black and stinking, something which
affects the lives of 154 million people in the river valley, one
of the country's major grain and energy producing areas.
</P>
<P>
The pollution of Taihu Lake has been a major environmental
problem affecting people and economic development in parts of
Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Efforts will be made at supervising better, developing
pollution control programs, and building urban waste treatment
facilities.
</P>
<P>
A NEPA official said in an interview with Xinhua that the
massive investment in pollution control projects along the Huaihe
will mainly come from the polluters and from local government.
</P>
<P>
The central government plans to provide a total of 1.3 billion
yuan (156 million US dollars) for pollution control projects, and
China is seeking a total of 400 million US dollars in loans from
the World Bank, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Ten million yuan will be allocated each year from 1997 to 2000
to solve the drinking water problem for millions of people along
the river, the worst polluted spots being in Henan, Anhui,
Jiangsu, and Shandong provinces. The Chinese government has
ordered that the Huaihe and Taihu be clean by 2000.
</P>
<P>
As a first step, it said that, by 1998 waste water discharged
by enterprises in the Huaihe and Taihu valleys must be treated up
to the standards set by the central government, before it can be
emptied into rivers and lakes.
</P>
<P>
China closed down 999 small paper-making factories in the
Huaihe valley by June 30, meeting the target it set last September
to close factories that produce annually less than 5,000 tons of
paper each.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Green Label, Newborn Program in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Green Label products are making
their debut in Thailand as the country is seeking to follow the
surging global trend of preserving the environment.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's move to develop Green Label products came some 20
years after ecolabeling first emerged in industrial countries like
Germany.
</P>
<P>
The first Green Label Program in Thailand was formally launched
in 1994 by the Industry Ministry and the Thailand Environment
Institute (TEI), aiming to arouse awareness of environment
protection among consumers and manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
The program was also designed to encourage manufacturers to
develop environmentally friendly products on a voluntary basis and
reduce the impact of production on the environment.
</P>
<P>
Thai Green Labels, or ecolabels, are different from those
promoted in industrial countries, like the United States where
ecolabels list specific impacts of products on the environment
during their manufacturing and consumption, such as how much
energy or water is consumed or what pollutants are released.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's ecolabeling system focuses on individual product
categories, mainly serving to identify products that have less
environmental impact than others in the same category.
</P>
<P>
The products approved in the Green Label program in Thailand
include office and sanitary recycled paper, products made from
recycled plastics, energy-saving fluorescent lamps, low-energy
refrigerators and air conditioners, mercury-free batteries and
environmentally-friendly detergents.
</P>
<P>
The public offers proposals for product criteria, which are
developed through consensus among the industry, the government and
non-government organizations. The criteria are reviewed every two
years.
</P>
<P>
The application process for a Green Label in Thailand generally
takes two months while the TEI charges an application fee of 1,000
baht (40 US dollars) for each product and a license fee of 5,000
baht (200 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Green Label products will receive constant checks to ensure
that manufacturers remain in compliance.
</P>
<P>
Thai consumers' attitudes toward Green Label products are
somewhat mixed as the price and quality of these products are
often more in the focus rather than the label.
</P>
<P>
Many manufacturers and distributors have expressed concern that
complying with the Green Label criteria may lead to higher costs.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts pointed out that success of Thailand's Green
Label program depends on the consumer acceptance, without which
few manufacturers are willing to bear additional investment costs.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Trade Deficit Projected at 2.85 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is expected to
register a lower trade deficit of 7.144 billion Malaysian Ringgit
(about 2.85 billion US dollars) this year, from last year's 9.1
billion Ringgit (about 3.64 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to a report released here today by the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry, the lower deficit could be
attributed to the government's policy requiring 60 percent local
sourcing for new construction projects.
</P>
<P>
The report also attributed the lower deficit to another
government policy to encourage domestic sourcing for components in
the manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
The report, released by Minister of International Trade and
Industry Rafidah Aziz, said that merchandise exports in 1996 were
forecast to reach 219.727 billion Ringgit (about 87.888 billion
dollars) against imports of 226.871 billion Ringgit (about 90.74
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The report also said Malaysia's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is
expected to grow at 8.3 percent in 1996 compared with 9.5 percent
in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Australian Killer Suspect Attempts Suicide: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The 29-year-old alleged mass
killer at Port Arthur, Australia, has reportedly attempted suicide
in prison in Tasmania, but prison authorities refused to make any
comment on the report.
</P>
<P>
The attempted suicide by Martin Bryant, accused to be
responsible for the most outrageous massacre in Australia's modern
history, was first reported by a local radio broadcaster Derryn
Hinch today.
</P>
<P>
However, Deputy Secretary of Tasmania's Corrective Services
Denbigh Richards later told the local press that there was no
official comment on the issue "one way or another."
</P>
<P>
"Anything that could contribute to speculation about Bryant's
mental condition is obviously potentially quite prejudicial to the
trial that's coming up later in the year," he told the Australian
Associated Press (AAP).
</P>
<P>
He said that he received the no-comment instruction from Damien
Bugg, director of the Public Prosecutions (DPP) of Tasmania state.
</P>
<P>
"That's been our position from the outset in relation to this
matter," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bryant is now held under custody in a prison in Hobart, the
capital city of Tasmania. He is charged with 70 crimes, including
34 counts of murder and 19 counts of attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
He is expected to appear before the Tasmanian Supreme Court on
September 9 for shooting dead 35 people and wounding another 18 in
Port Arthur in Tasmania on April 28. The massacre was also the
most serious one committed by a lone gunman in the world.
</P>
<P>
Bryant is from Clare Street in New Town of the island state.

<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- More than 16,600 hectares of land
along the Yarlung Zangbo River, the longest river in Tibet, has
been afforested since 1990, effectively curbing the spread of
deserts in the region.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Ministry of Forestry show that another
67,000 ha of land in the area has been enclosed, to prevent
tree-felling.
</P>
<P>
Situated on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, "the roof of the
world", the areas along the Yarlung Zangbo River have been
endangered by deserts because of the peculiar geography and
environment.
</P>
<P>
"The desertification on both sides of the river imposed a great
threat to local agricultural and industrial production," said a
local official.
</P>
<P>
A desertification control plan has been mapped out, setting a
good foundation for further work. The Ministry of Forestry has
promised to support the Tibet Autonomous Region in the work.

<HEADLINE> Chernomyrdin Takes Charge of Blast Investigations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin decided today to take charge of the investigations
into the two blasts which occurred in Moscow Thursday and Friday.
</P>
<P>
Chernomyrdin asked the police to report to him all information
about the two trolleybus explosions, the Itar-Tass News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-two people were reported injured when a bomb ripped
through a trolleybus in central Moscow early today, a day after a
bomb explosion left five injured in another trolleybus.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's blast occurred at about 9:00 a.m. when the
trolleybus approached Pushkin Square, the most popular meeting
place in the capital, about one kilometer from the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
The explosion today was the third one on Moscow's busy public
transportation system in a month. On June 11, a subway bomb killed
four people and injured a dozen just days before Russia's
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
The blasts raised fears among officials and Moscow citizens
that Chechen separatists might be carrying out threats to bring
their war with the Kremlin to the Russian capital.
</P>
<P>
The police described the explosions as terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
The two blasts happened just days after Russian President Boris
Yeltsin issued a decree to fight against crimes in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The Moscow interior police and transportation police have
blocked all the passes into the center of the capital and
conducted spot checks to vehicles that are entering the city
center.

<HEADLINE> Arab Leaders Angry at Netanyahu's Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- As Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu plans to visit some selected Arab capitals, Arab leaders
could hardly hold back their anger over his tough stand on
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Major newspapers in the Arab world carried a story today that
Netanyahu would come to meet President Hosni Mubarak on Thursday
amid mounting criticism of his intransigent policy on the city,
holy to Jews, Muslims and Christians alike.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli prime minister, who came to power in May elections,
is now in the United States to drum up supports for his hardline
policy. But his speech at the Congress on Wednesday fanned up
worry and outrage among the Arab leaders.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu told the U.S. law-makers that his government would
never allow the redivision of Jerusalem, a city claimed by both
Israel and Palestine as their capitals.
</P>
<P>
Esmat Abdul-Maguid, secretary-general of the 22-nation Arab
League (AL) accused on Thursday Netanyahu of "encouraging tension
and violence" in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
His speech constitutes a "flagrant challenge to the
resolutions of international legitimacy," said the AL chief based
in the Egyptian capital.
</P>
<P>
"What he said in the speech is also incompatible with the
Madrid formula and with the Oslo and Washington agreement which
was signed on September 13, 1993, and which stipulates Jerusalem
is one of the issues for negotiations on a final settlement
between the Palestinians and Israelis," Abdul-Maguid was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Former Israeli government led by Shimon Peres accepted the
principle that status of the holy city be tackled at the final
stage of negotiations. But when the Likud-dominant new government
assumed power last month, the possibility was ruled out.
</P>
<P>
"It is as though someone were putting the cart before the
horse. This attitude takes the peace process in the Middle East
backwards," the AL chief noted.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leaders were specially annoyed by Netanyahu's
remarks. Yasser Arafat told reporters in Gaza on Thursday that
Jerusalem "is the capital of Palestine forever."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Faisal Husseini, senior aide to Arafat, asserted the
same day that Netanyahu eventually declared a war against Arabs.
</P>
<P>
It seemed that the announced visit by Netanyahu to the Egyptian
port city of Alexandra could hardly quell the anxiety among the
Arab leaders.
</P>
<P>
They had expected the White House to push the new Israeli
leader forward, but they felt disappointed as President Bill
Clinton failed to press Netanyahu to soften his stand.
</P>
<P>
President Mubarak has said that he knew little about the new
Israeli prime minister and would not rush to make any judgement
before he meets him. However, many remain skeptical about the
result of the upcoming face-to-face talks between the two leaders.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Amman said that Netanyahu would also visit Jordan
to meet his closest Arab friend King Hussein next week. The
Jordanian leader remained optimistic about the peace process and
his meeting with the Israeli visitor might be a different
story.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Deputy Minister of Petroleum Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Deputy Minister of
Petroleum Mohamed Najad Husseinian has disclosed that he has
had fruitful talks with officials of the Yemeni Ministry of
Petroleum.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Yemeni News Agency Thursday night at the
end of his six-day visit to Yemen, the Iranian deputy minister
said that during his visit, he signed three protocols on bilateral
cooperation in the various fields of petroleum.
</P>
<P>
The protocols, he said, cover many areas of cooperation,
foremost among which is Iran's readiness to develop the crude oil
refinery in Aden and to provide it with shipments of some
20,000 barrels per day of Iranian oil starting September.
</P>
<P>
He also said that his country was willing to train Yemeni
petroleum workers in Iran.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian minister, who arrived here Saturday, expressed his
satisfaction with the status of political relations between the
two countries and their steady endeavors to promote economic
ties, including petroleum industry.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Prime Minister to Visit Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu will pay a one-day visit to Egypt next Thursday, the
first such visit to an Arab state since he assumed power last
month, according to the local press here today.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is scheduled to hold talks with Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria, on ways and
means to push the Middle East peace process forward as well as
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
According to diplomatic sources here, Netanyahu's visit aims
to explain his stance toward the peace process, despite his
adherence to a stringent policy on the peace process and rejection
of the land-for-peace principle.
</P>
<P>
Such an attitude has given rise to concern and anger on the
part of the Arab states, including Egypt. It has also prompted
intensive diplomatic drives at Arab and international levels,
including the holding of the Arab summit in Cairo last month in an
effort to unify Arab ranks to confront the challenges facing the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli prime minister is scheduled to visit Jordan after
Egypt.

TOKYO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Electricity output by Japan's nine

billion kilowatt-hours, up for the ninth straight month from
year-earlier levels, Kyodo News Service quoted an industry
association as reporting Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Federation of Electric Power Companies said the figure
included electricity purchased by the electric utilities from

It attributed the increase to hot weather across the nation
which boosted electricity consumption for air conditioning.
</P>
<P>
Output by the Kyushu and Shikoku Electric Power companies
soared 10.0 percent and 9.4 percent, respectively, owing to brisk
demand for industrial use, the federation said.

<HEADLINE> Books on Sino-US Relations Popular </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- A new book that expresses strong
patriotic feelings against US intervention in China's affairs is
currently a bestseller in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Titled "A Depiction of Trials of Strength Between China and the
United States," the book is widely regarded as a move to combat US
pressure.
</P>
<P>
It traces the Sino-US relations from the War to Resist US
Aggression and Aid Korea (1950-1953) to Lee Teng-hui's trip to the
United States last July. And it discloses, for the first time in a
Chinese publication, that James Lilley, the former US ambassador
to China, masterminded Lee's US visit.
</P>
<P>
The book reveals behind-the-scenes and background information
that detail the US' pressure on China, which subsequently resulted
in conflicts over issues such as Taiwan, textile trade, human
rights, intellectual property rights, arms sales, the most-favored
nation status and Harry Wu, a so-called "human rights" activist
who was deported to the U.S. for violating several Chinese laws.
</P>
<P>
Chai Zemin, the first Chinese ambassador to the United States
since the two countries normalized their relations, was advisor to
the book-editing. In the book's preface, Chai wrote that the
people of both China and the United States are the great
people. However, the United States has proceeded from its own
interests and "presumptuously" attempted to impose its own values
and social system on others, making trouble for China, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is unacceptable," Chai wrote.
</P>
<P>
Chai claimed that there are a few people in the United States
who make an uproar about the "China threat" and cry for a
"containment" policy toward China, in an attempt to hinder the
country's growth and to prevent it from becoming mighty.
</P>
<P>
Such efforts by the US are "doomed to failure," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes that the US and China can develop relations
peacefully, with more mutual understanding and respect which will
benefit both countries.
</P>
<P>
More than 20,000 copies of "A Depiction of Trials of Strength
Between China and the United States" sold out in less than a
month, according to Qin Qianli, chief editor of the "Global
Affairs Book Series."
</P>
<P>
In addition to printing the book, Qin said he is working on
another book that tells of the Sino-US relations from another
perspective.
</P>
<P>
These books, which reviewed the past history and were written in
response to a patriotic calling, are expected to be increasingly
popular in China for the rest of the year, Qin predicted.

<HEADLINE> British Services' School in Hong Kong Closes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Union Flag was lowered in
the music of Loretto Pipes and Drums today at St George's School
this noon to announce the closure of this British Services' school
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Pupils and teachers put away their textbooks, dusted off the
blackboards and closed the classroom doors for the last time
today, bringing to an end of over 40 years of schooling for
Service children in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Since its establishment in 1955, St George's has provided
education for more than 17,000 pupils. By this summer most of the
Garrison's school children have returned to the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Led by the headmaster Martin Cater, 57 pupils aged between 11
and 15 encircled the pole to salute the flag while it was lowered.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the school said that the school was at its
peak in the late 1970s when there were over 1,200 pupils and 54
teaching staff. However, since the reduction of the Garrison and
the departure of groups of students last week, there are now
only 57 pupils and 23 staff, many of whom will take up new
teaching posts with Service schools in Germany and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
She said that at present there are about 3,200 British armymen
garrisoned in Hong Kong. The peak time was in the 1970s when
there were some 10,000 British servicemen in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Macao Proposes Subsidy Increase for the Unemployed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MACAO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Macao Government has proposed to
extend subsidy period and increase the subsidies to the unemployed
and the proposal is expected to be approved soon, local
press reported.
</P>
<P>
The "Va Kio" newspaper quoted Vitor Pessoa, secretary for
Economic Coordination, as saying that it is necessary to increase
the subsidies although it will increase the government expenditure
by 11.40 million Patacas (about 1.44 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to the proposal, involuntary unemployed workers can
get subsidies for a maximum of 90 days rather than the previous
60 days; and the monthly subsidies will be raised from 430 Patacas
(about 54.4 US dollars) to 600 Patacas (about 75.9 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Pessoa said that the average period of unemployment for those
who lost job involuntarily has increased from 30 days last year to
60 days currently, and some jobless people even cannot find a job in
two months time.
</P>
<P>
Between January and June this year, a total of 444 unemployed
people were granted applications for subsidies from the government.
The total subsidies reached 1.32 million Patacas (about 167,000 US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
A slow-down economy in Macao has resulted in the increase of the
number of unemployed people in the past few years.

<HEADLINE> Guizhou Exhibits Anti-Poverty Achievements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- A photography exhibit that
illustrates anti-poverty achievements in Guizhou opened today in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is aimed at raising viewers' awareness about the
poor conditions of the southwestern China province, according to
the Chinese Photographers' Association, a major sponsor of the
exhibition.
</P>
<P>
Included in the show are about 100 photos that were selected
from among some 3,000 entries.
</P>
<P>
An official from the provincial government said that Guizhou
has adopted a series of policies and measures to help more people
overcome poverty and become well-to-do.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that after ten years of efforts, the province
now still has approximately eight million people who live in want
and need, who account for 25 percent of Guizhou's
population. Nevertheless, the total figure is down from 70 percent
ten years ago.
</P>
<P>
The official admitted that there is still a long way to go
before poverty is eliminated in the province.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou has 48 poor counties -- 8.1 percent of the country's
total, and the poor population in the province accounts for 12
percent of the country's total, he said.
</P>
<P>
From July 1-4, more than five million people in 59 counties in
the province suffered from damages caused by torrential rains and
flooding. The financial losses caused by the floods totalled 4.6
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, China had 65 million people living in
poverty, mostly in its southwestern and northwestern parts, which
are prone to harsh natural conditions.

<HEADLINE> Sales of Automobiles Slightly Up in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Sales of automobiles rose slightly
in the first four months of the year in Macao, following news that
automobile tariffs will be increased soon, the Macao Daily News
reported today.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,628 motor vehicles were sold between January and
April, up 16.3 percent from the same period last year, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
Experts attributed the increasing sales mainly to a response to
the news that the government will soon raise the automobile tax.
</P>
<P>
Automobile sales in Macao had dropped by more than 30 percent
to 3,737 units in 1995 because of a sluggish economy, but the
experts are now expecting the total sales to reach 4,100 this
year, an increase of 10 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
The growth in automobile sales is expected to slow down in the
latter half of the year after the proposed tax increase, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Lower and middle-priced vehicles, pricing less than 150,000
patacas (about 18,980 US dollars), accounted for the majority of
the newly-sold, leaving the luxury cars in the cold.
</P>
<P>
Japanese cars remained the most popular on the market, with a
total of 1,085 vehicles sold. Sales of vehicles from the Republic
of Korea rose sharply by 157.8 percent from the same period of
last year while sales of European cars increased by 13.9
percent.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Seeking Biological Ways To Control HIV </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Dr. Robert Gallo, who discovered
the HIV-1 virus and also proved it causes AIDS, has called on
scientists to seek biological ways to overcome the fatal disease
instead of relying on chemical therapy.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an international bioscience seminar here Thursday,
Dr. Gallo said that it is incumbent upon academic scientists
working on fundamental aspects of HIV pathogenesis to take ideas
from their work toward the development of "natural" biological
approaches to control HIV and HIV disease.
</P>
<P>
He was making a keynote speech at the Second International
Symposium of the Asia Pacific Society of Bioscientists held in
Hong Kong. Dr. Gallo now is director of the University of
Maryland's Institute for human Virology and Biotechnology
Institute.
</P>
<P>
Despite the latest progress made in chemical therapy, the world
most referenced scientist pointed out that therapy will likely be
needed for very long periods of time and those chemicals are toxic
and eventually may not be tolerable or may induce immune disorders
themselves. He reported on recent development in his search for
natural biological approaches.
</P>
<P>
The lecture given by Dr. Gallo was the highlight of the
four-day meeting, which drew more than 200 bioscientists from
Australia, China, Japan, North America, Singapore and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
A good number of scientific papers were presented on a wide
range of biotechnology research development and the future
prospects of biotech research and commercialization in the
Asia-Pacific region.

CAIRO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Russia has reiterated its adherence
to the land-for-peace formula, to the U.N. resolutions on peace in
the Middle East and to the principles agreed upon at the Madrid
peace conference.
</P>
<P>
In his interview with the Egyptian Middle East News Agency
today, Russian Ambassador in Cairo Vladimir Jodev said that
his country, in its capacity as co-sponsor of the Middle East
peace process, adheres to its basic stance on the establishment of
peace in the region and the need to maintain the momentum
over the last few years.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of avoiding the suspension of the
accords already reached between the Palestinian and Israeli sides
through strenuous and relentless efforts.
</P>
<P>
He spelled out the pressing need to resume peace negotiations
in order to keep the process going.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that Russia was prepared to extend
constructive contribution in pushing the peace process forward,
and was also ready to help create the necessary grounds for the
resumption of negotiations. Russia is being driven by its
responsibility as co-sponsor of the Middle East peace process, he
said.

Minister Amr Moussa, scheduled from July 15 to 17,
as having paramount and special importance, in view of the
latest developments in the Middle East ever since Benjamin
Netanyahu assumed power in Israel last month.
</P>
<P>
The Russian ambassador said that foremost among the topics to
be discussed by Moussa in Moscow will be the political situation
in the region, several other regional issues and matters related
to disarmament and the dismantling of mass destruction weapons.
</P>
<P>
He said that it would also be natural that Moussa's
visit would deal with the prospective visit by Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak to Moscow and the related preparations.

<HEADLINE> China Publishes National Property Journal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- In another move to improve the
management of state assets, China officially published its first
national newspaper for property news today.
</P>
<P>
The "China Property News," a semi-weekly publication, covers
news that reflects China's progress in reforming its economic
structure and state-owned enterprises, according to the State
Administration of State Property (SASP), China's state property
watchdog.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper also includes articles about China's principles
and policies, rules and laws on the management of state assets,
and has been authorized by the SASP to publish notices of property
rights registration.
</P>
<P>
The SASP announced in May that China would introduce a system
this year mandating the publication of property rights
registration.
</P>
<P>
Typical cases and exemplary people involved in curbing the loss
and increasing the value of state assets will also be written
about in the newspaper, SASP officials said during a ceremony for
the founding of the journal.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Youcai, vice-minister of finance and director-general of
the SASP, told reporters that "ensuring the well-being of the
newspaper is of great significance to bolstering the public
awareness of state property and maintaining the economic
foundation of socialism."
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China's state property currently is valued
at 5.192 trillion yuan (about 618 billion US dollars), up from
merely 20 billion yuan in 1949, when New China was founded.

<HEADLINE> Brisk Rural Market For China's Farm Vehicles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Despite sluggish automobile sales
recently, farm vehicles are fairly popular with some 800 million
Chinese farmers, "China Machinery and Electronics News" reports.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, China produced 2.3 million farm vehicles, 800,000 more
than the number of automobiles made in the year.
</P>
<P>
Farm vehicles were first produced in China in 1979 when the
country's economic reform and opening to the outside world was
launched. By 1993, the number produced was 1.3 million, equalling
the number of automobiles for the same year, the paper
notes. China now has 10 million farm vehicles in use.
</P>
<P>
Brisk sales of farm vehicles have drawn an increasing number of
domestic enterprises to the business, leading to scattered
production and waste of funds.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China has 261 farm vehicle manufacturers
with an annual production capacity of 2.55 million units, with
supply and demand basically equal.
</P>
<P>
Experts say, though, that it is time to take steps to set up
farm vehicle enterprise conglomerates in order to ensure more
orderly farm vehicle production and avoid the mistakes made by the
auto industry, which lacks an economy of scale.

<HEADLINE> Arabic Countries Angry With Netanyahu's Hardline Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Angry Arabs have reacted strongly
towards Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's unyielding
statements which he made during a visit in the United States,
reports reaching here say.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Washington Tuesday, Netanyahu declared Israel would
never allow Jerusalem to be divided between Arabs and Jews. He
added: "We should not allow a Berlin Wall to be erected within
Jerusalem."
</P>
<P>
He also again rejected the land-for-peace principle and
reaffirmed his adherence to the expansion of Jewish settlements
and the non-withdrawal from the Arab territories including the
Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Within minutes of Netanyahu's telling Congress he would never
allow the holy city to be redivided Wednesday, Marwan Kanafani, a
spokesman for Palestinian President Yasser Arafat, accused Israeli
Prime Minister Netanyahu of lying about the Palestinian position
on Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Syria, expressing disappointment over the outcome of the
meeting between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Netanyahu, accused
Netanyahu of making such statements and urged Arabs to punish him
by reconsidering all measures to normalise ties with Israel, said
Damascus's official press.
</P>
<P>
In Egypt, a frontpage editorial of the government newspaper
Al-Akhbar said Wednesday that there were limits to Arab patience
and warned of eruption of Arab anger if Netanyahu persisted in his
policies.
</P>
<P>
Describing the remarks by Netanyahu as provocative and
arrogant, the paper said they were a sign that he was deluded into
thinking he could frighten Arabs into submission to Israeli
domination.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, the Arab League secretariat said the Israeli prime
minister had encouraged tension and violence in the Middle East
with his speech to the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid said the content of the
speech was "a flagrant challenge to the resolutions of
international legitimacy", especially when Netanyahu said
Jerusalem would remain the united capital of Israel forever.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a former Israeli Minister of Science and Education,
Sholamit Aloni, also accused Netanyahu of risking his country's
destruction by ruling out territorial concessions with Israel's
Arab neighbours.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview with Egypt's English-language
newspaper, Al-Ahram Weekly, Aloni warned that the colonial
policies were a threat to the existence of the state of Israel.
</P>
<P>
The new Israeli leader must choose "between his arrogance and
building healthy relations with the Arabs," he added.

<HEADLINE> Hashimoto Orders Lawsuit Against Okinawa Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto today ordered a lawsuit seeking a court ruling to force
Okinawa Governor Masahide Ota to take legal steps for the
continued use of land for a U.S. Navy facility in the prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Justice Ministry and the Defense
Facilities Administration Agency will file the suit with the Naha
branch of the Fukuoka High Court later in the day, Kyodo News
reported.
</P>
<P>
The suit takes issue with Ota's refusal to comply with a
request by Hashimoto that he make public papers detailing a
government request for the expropriation of a plot of land within
the Sobe communications facility in the village of Yomitan on the
southwestern island prefecture, Kyodo said.
</P>
<P>
Ota has said he could not comply with the request before a
final ruling by the Supreme Court on his appeal against a lower
court decision ordering him to sign documents needed for continued
rental of land plots owned by Okinawa residents for use by the
U.S. military.
</P>
<P>
He also has expressed disappointment at the contents of an
interim report by a Japan-U.S. governmental panel on how to reduce
U.S. bases in Okinawa, saying the report is not satisfactory to
the people of Okinawa.
</P>
<P>
The lease on the 236-square-meter plot owned by Okinawa shop
owner Shoichi Chibana expired at the end of March, but the
government has continued to use the plot for the U.S. Navy
facility with no clear legal basis.
</P>
<P>
The central government says the use of the plot can be
warranted for national security reasons to abide by the
Japan-U.S. security pact.
</P>
<P>
The Naha branch of the Fukuoka High Court is expected to make a
decision on the latest case in November.

<HEADLINE> Thai Banks Call for Bewaring of Fake US Dollar Notes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The notes, first noticed in Japan in 1994, have been brought
into Thailand by tourists from countries that have opened up to
the world in recent years, such as Yugoslavia, and their quality
is hard to tell from that of the genuine bills.
</P>
<P>
Without top-quality inspection machines, the forgeries are hard
to detect, causing problems for many foreign exchange booths, the
Bangkok Post today quoted a Krung Thai bank spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
Thai Farmers Bank accepts the 1990 series only at booths with
inspection equipment but, as a safeguard, is not selling them to
customers.
</P>
<P>
Many tourists are disappointed when told that their 1990
100-dollar notes are worthless.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Weakens in Course Toward North Carolina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- While hundreds of thousands of
coastal residents and vacationers were ordered to evacuate,
Hurricane Bertha weakened on Thursday as it moved toward the
Carolina coast.
</P>
<P>
The top winds dropped to 128 kph from 168 kph on in the
afternoon, but Bertha, more than 640 kilometers wide, menaced the
coast on Thursday night with tropical storm winds.
</P>
<P>
At 8 p.m. eastern standard time, Bertha's center was 344
kilometers south-southeast of Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, moving
north-northwest at about 16 kph. The center of the hurricane would
most likely hit Myrtle Beach around noon Friday, the Hurricane
Center said.
</P>
<P>
Emergency shelters were opened for the thousands of people
along the North and South Carolina coasts under evacuation orders.
</P>
<P>
South Carolina ordered evacuation of about 150,000 coastal
residents in Horry and Georgetown counties, including the popular
resort town of Myrtle Beach.
</P>
<P>
The two-day evacuation in North Carolina sent more than 100,000
residents and vacationers to higher ground.
</P>
<P>
Commanders at Seymour Johnson Air Force Base in Goldsboro,
North Carolina, decided on Thursday to shut down operations. The
base's planes were sent earlier to Louisiana and Wisconsin.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Encourage Expansion of Exporting Range </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The government of Nepal will
encourage local exporters to expand the range of the country's
export items in the new fiscal year starting from next week,
according to Finance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat.
</P>
<P>
While informing local press about the highlights of the
government's budget plan for the 1996-97 fiscal year here
Thursday, Mahat said emphasis had been given to increasing the
range of export items on which Nepal has comparative advantage on
the international market.
</P>
<P>
If the country continued to depend on a few export items, its
economy would be vulnerable, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Carpet and ready-made garment, Nepal's major export items at
present, had witnessed stagnant growth and even decline in export
in recent years mainly due to the low quality and intense
international competition.
</P>
<P>
Export of agricultural products like orthodox tea, cut flowers
and other items on which Nepal could compete in foreign markets
would have to be promoted in order to boost the economy, Mahat
said.
</P>
<P>
Industries contributing to promoting the export sector would be
given facilities and incentives by the government, he promised.
</P>
<P>
According to latest government figures, Nepal's total foreign
trade volume in the first nine months of the 1995-96 fiscal year
was 1.24 billion US dollars with a deficit of 721 million dollars,
up 25 percent over the same period of the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Visa International Launches New Easy Cards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The Visa International announced
here today that it has launched a new magnetic card to serve the
coming Atlanta Olympic games, with more functions than travel
checks, and much easier to use while traveling around the world.
</P>
<P>
Named Visa TravelMoney, it is a kind of pre-paid card to allow
24-hour access to dedicated travel funds. The company made public
the card here, with the strong hope that athletes and visitors
from across the world will bring the new way of money management
back to their countries at the end of the games.
</P>
<P>
The card can be purchased for any desired amount and in any
major convertible currencies. The buyer does not have to establish
a bank account at all. At the time of purchase, the consumer can
select or receive a personal identification number (PIN) to obtain
funds in local currency at more than 280,000 Visa automatic teller
machines (ATMs) in 105 countries and regions, explained Linda
McCoy of the Visa International.
</P>
<P>
The card, with the same size as other magnetic cards, enables
the owner to withdraw cash from the ATMs at any time of the day.
The exchange rates will be more favorable than it is found at
currency exchanges, McCoy said. It proved a safe way of carrying
about cash.
</P>
<P>
If the card is ever lost or stolen, the Visa International
Service Center will immediately arrange for its replacement, she
said.
</P>
<P>
"Travelers today are looking for alternative ways to obtain
their travel funds that are safe, fast and convenient," said
Robert Fader, managing director of Travelers Cheques at Citicorp.
</P>
<P>
With a trial period of 18 months, the card is now supported by
new Visa members including those in Britain, Brazil, Puerto Rico,
and Taiwan. In just nine months, the cards have been used for more
than 10,000 transactions in 53 countries or regions.
</P>
<P>
Today, Visa also unfolded a separate program -- Visa cash
cards. To serve the coming Olympic Games, the company has
produced microchip-embedded card with denominations of 10, 20,
50 and 100 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
When it is time to pay, customers simply insert the card into a
handy Visa Cash reader, mostly found in shops, restaurants, taxes
or subway stations. The consumer confirms the value displayed on
the reader and presses a green button to deduct the purchase
amount. Some cards are reloadable.
</P>
<P>
Experts said Visa Cash is also a revolution in the retailing
sector. There is less need to carry cash and coins. But market
analysts said popularity of Visa Cash depends on the number of
card readers installed.
</P>
<P>
The company said that in Atlanta alone, up to 5,000 such
machines have been installed in 1,500 sites.

<HEADLINE> Leadership Crisis Deepens in India's Congress Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The leadership crisis within
India's Congress party has deepened over speculation that the
party's President P.V. Narasimha Rao may quit following his
involvement in a cheating case, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
In this connection, a meeting of the Congress Working Committee
(CWC), the supreme decision making body of the party, scheduled
for today is of utmost importance.
</P>
<P>
The CWC meeting is expected to further deliberate on the
development arising out of summons issued to Rao by a Delhi court
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The former prime minister was accused of cooperating with a
controversial godman in cheating a non-resident Indian businessman
of 100,000 US dollars in 1983 by falsely promising lucrative
commercial contracts to him.
</P>
<P>
The loyalists and detractors of Rao are busy drawing up their
strategy to defend and embarrass him respectively.
</P>
<P>
While the dissidents are demanding that Rao should step down as
party president, the loyalists do not find any justification in
the demand.
</P>
<P>
The loyalists hope that the leader would weather the storm yet
again as he has done so often in the past.
</P>
<P>
The two factions may have a showdown on the leadership issue in
the coming CWC meeting today.

<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 11 (Xinhua) -- European Union (EU) Commission
Chairman Jacques Santer today called for more efforts by the
organization and its member nations to develop their small and
medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Santer said the revitalization of small and medium-sized firms
would provide a new momentum of growth for the EU economies and
create many jobs.
</P>
<P>
He was addressing a conference of European bankers and
entrepreneurs, which opened in Luxemburg today. It is discussing
trans-national cooperation for small and medium-sized enterprises
and the role of banks in the process.
</P>
<P>
Santa said small and medium-sized firms were playing "a vital
role" in the EU's economic development and overcoming
unemployment. They had "great potential for development" and
would provide hope for the revitalization of the EU economies, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Small and medium-sized enterprises account for 99.8 percent of
the total in the EU countries, with their employees making up 66
percent of the employed in the EU and their output value 65
percent of the EU's total.
</P>
<P>
The EU and its member nations should implement a policy to help
the development of their small and medium-sized enterprises,
Santer said.
</P>
<P>
The policy should help these enterprises obtain loans, apply
new technology and enter markets within and outside Europe, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Small and medium-sized enterprises should be encouraged to
invest in personnel training and in establishing partnerships with
large enterprises within the EU.
</P>
<P>
Santer called on the EU to take political measures to quickly
and effectively tap the growing potential of the small and
medium-sized enterprises, Santer said.
</P>
<P>
The two-day conference, called "Partnership '96", is organized
by the EU Commission.

Kiev, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian President Leonid Danilovich
Kuchma is defending his decision to remove Valevy Shmarov from his
post of Minister of Defense, claiming it was "the only correct
decision."
</P>
<P>
Shmarov was removed from the post on July 8. On July 11,
President Kuchma issued an order of appointing Aleksandr Kuzymuk,
Commander of the Ukrainian National Guard, to replace Shmarov as
the Minister of Defense.
</P>
<P>
The president criticized Shmarov for not carrying out his major
duties properly, such as building good relations between the armed
forces, industrial departments and the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
President Kuchma also expressed worry about the social and
political affairs of the armed forces. He pointed out that there
had been a record of bad behavior in the forces, including theft
of weapons and state property.
</P>
<P>
He instructed the new minister to thoroughly investigate these
problems.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Vladimir Gorbulin, Secretary of the National
Security Council, also criticized Shmarov for obstructing certain
orders of the president and the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
He said the former defense minister had shelved some interior
problems of the armed forces. He blamed Shmarov for not making a
clear distinction of the duties of the Ministry of Defense and the
General Staff Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
The president also criticized the Navy Command for what he
called harmful tendencies in the fleet.
</P>
<P>
Local observers believe that after the formation of a new
constitution, Kuchma will use the opportunity to form a new cabinet
to carry out personnel adjustments in the armed forces, and
strengthen presidential power.

rapidly in the past few years, had 2,851 schools run by various
non-governmental organizations or individuals.
</P>
<P>
Some, however, had gotten a bad reputation because of being
poorly managed, or because of irregularities in granting of
degrees and charging of fees.
</P>
<P>
The Henan Education Committee looked into the matter in March
in a review of school management and teaching quality.
</P>
<P>
Two hundred and twenty-five private schools were found to have
bad conditions or to have violated school rules, and were ordered
closed, while a number of schools were told to make improvements
within a certain period of time.
</P>
<P>
Some schools were censored for advertisements that made
promises that were not kept.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,500 private schools survived the scrutiny and had their
registration extended.

<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Six wooden nightstools, as well as
another 300 exquisite burial articles, have been unearthed from a
tomb dating back to the Western Han Dynasty (206 BC-220 AD) in
Chaohu City, east China's Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
It remains a mystery for Chinese archaeologists that the tomb's
occupant had so many nightstools buried with him.
</P>
<P>
The experts discovered no remains of the tomb's occupant, but a
dozen human teeth were found. They established that the name of
the man buried in the tomb was Lu Ke, but they have no clues about
him.
</P>
<P>
The other burial articles unearthed include bronze, lacquered
items, jade and coins. Experts say that the tomb is unique in

<HEADLINE> Europe Should Defy U.S. Helms-Burton Act, Says Kinkel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Europe should adopt a hard stance
towards the U.S. anti-Cuba "Helms-Burton" bill, German Foreign
Minister Hans Kinkel said here today.
</P>
<P>
"This is a policy which aims to deal with the enemy but on the
contrary hurts friends," Kinkel told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
The bill allegedly violates international law and World Trade
Organization (WTO) regulations.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel urged the United States to withdraw the bill which the
U.S. Congress passed in March in retaliation for the shooting down
in February of two U.S.-registered aircraft by Cuban jet fighters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Germany was willing to make new efforts in
establishing a "trans-Atlantic free trade area" which included the
European Union, the United States and Canada and would be open to
all who wished to join, said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel noted that the proposal, which he put forward during a
visit to the U.S. last year, had won support from most EU member
countries, although different attitudes existed among Americans.
</P>
<P>
The world was in a process of transition, which provided an
appropriate opportunity for Europe to renew its partnership with
North American countries. Europe should exert more influence on
U.S. politics, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.S. anti-Cuba bill, named after its sponsors,
Republican Senator Jesse Helms and Indiana Republican
Representative Dan Burton, no Cuban-made commodities would be
allowed to enter the U.S. market via other countries.
</P>
<P>
The bill would deny U.S. visas to foreigners who profited from
property that was confiscated by the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
Since its passage in the U.S. Congress, many countries and
organizations have lodged protests against the bill, saying they
will not accept the measures, and will continue to develop trade
and economic relations with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The European Union, which accounts for 45 percent of Cuba's
foreign trade, has said that the bill violates international law
and it may challenge the measure through the WTO.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian government announced on June 17 measures to
counter-attack the law by introducing legislation amending the
Foreign Extraterritorial Measures Act against "foreign measures
such as the U.S. Helms-Burton Act."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Denial Visa to Samper Causes Anger in Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. decision today
to revoke Colombian President Ernesto Samper's entry visa for his
alleged association with drug cartels has provoked fierce wrath
and concern in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
Liberal Party President Emilio Lebolo Castellano said the
decision has seriously hurt the national dignity of Colombia.
</P>
<P>
President of the National Conservative Directorate Jaime Arias
Ramirez denounced the act of the U.S. government since it offends
all Colombians and tarnishs Colombia's image in not only the
United States but the whole world.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former Foreign Minister Diego Rivera Vargas deemed
the move as a vindicative act against Samper and ruthless meddling
in Colombia's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Saras Pretel, president of the National Merchants Federation,
said some U.S. businessmen, at the recommendation of their
government, had refused to cooperate with Colombian partners, a
clear signal of impending U.S. economic sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Samper was accused of receiving funds from the Cali drug
cartel, the world's biggest cocaine syndicate in his election
campaign that brought him to power in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Observers believed the U.S. decision may indicate possible
U.S. sanctions against Colombia in the near future.
</P>
<P>
According to a U.S. government statement, President Samper will
be barred, starting today, from entering the U.S. territory in any
capacity, making it impossible for him to attend the annual
general assembly of the United Nations in New York late this year.
</P>
<P>
Samper is the second world leader denied of visas to enter the
United States. The last one was former U.N. Secretary-General Kurt
Waldheim who was Austria's president in 1987 when his name was
added to the immigration watch list by the U.S. authorities for
alleged links with Austrian-born Adolf Hitler's regime.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Ruling Party Rejects Call to Delay Poll </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's ruling party Golkar
Thursday rejected suggestions by an independent election watchdog
to call off the process of next year's general elections, the
Indonesian Observer reported today.
</P>
<P>
Golkar Chairman Harmoko told local journalists that there were
no grounds to stop the electoral process with the Voter
Registration Committee running smoothly and objectively.
</P>
<P>
According to the National Election Institution, some 90 percent
of the registered voters are prepared to vote in the 1997
parliamentary election, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Independent Election Monitoring Committee (KIPP) Monday
said that the parliamentary election should be postponed because
the government is meddling in one of the three legal political
parties.
</P>
<P>
"The vulgar intervention in the Indonesian Democratic Party
(PDI) underlines the fact that political parties taking part in
the election are not independent," said KIPP Chairman Goenawan
Mohamad.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made amid a mounting political tension in the
country after the government and the military backed a PDI rebel
faction in holding a congress last month which elected Soerjadi to
oust the party's leader Megawati Sukarnoputri.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China Will Need Six Million Video Recorders in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- China's market demand for video
tape-recorders is expected to reach six million sets in the year
2000, even with the rapid development of video compact disc
players, China's "Market Daily" has reported.
</P>
<P>
The market is predicted to grow at an annual rate of 14.9
percent and has a potential of 3.5 million sets in 1996 and four
million in 1997, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, video players had a market share of 63 percent, but
the growth rate slowed down, while video tape-recorders with two
to four magnetic heads enjoyed steady growth.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted experts as saying that VCD players are
expected to take some of video tape-players' market share if
former's price drops.
</P>
<P>
China sold three million digital video disc and VCD players
last year and is expected to sell six million in the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Poland Signs Agreement to Join OECD </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Polish Deputy Prime Minister
Grzegorz Kovodko formally signed an accord to join the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in
Paris today.
</P>
<P>
The accord will make Poland the 28th member state of the OECD
after it is approved by the Polish parliament and President
Aleksander Kwasniewski.
</P>
<P>
Kwasniewski said the signing of the agreement, which is of
historic significance, has paved the way for Warsaw to enter the
European Union more easily.
</P>
<P>
The entry into the OECD is an acknowledgement of Poland's
economic achievement and "a special certificate" which can help
the country gain more loans from developed countries, Prime
Minister Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz said.
</P>
<P>
Some local newspapers urged more consultations between the two
sides over economic policies and more rapid reforms in Poland's
economic sectors so as to make them more competitive
internationally.
</P>
<P>
Poland applied for OECD membership in February 1994 and entered
into talks with the OECD in November the same year. The
negotiations ended on June 27, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Paris-based OECD, founded in 1961, holds over 200
committees covering almost all economic fields. Its decisions have
significant influence over its member states.

<HEADLINE> China Stresses Product Quality for Mineral Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Businesses that handle rare earth
-- an essential source of minerals for metallurgy, textiles and
other industries -- should improve the quality of their product,
today's "China Daily" cited a State overseeing board as saying.
</P>
<P>
"China's rare earth industry as a whole already operates on a
large scale, so there's not much potential for the sector's future
development by continuous increase of scale and output," said an
official of the Rare Earth Office under the State Planning
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Rare earth is the general name of more than a dozen of elements
such as neodymium, samarium and lanthanum.
</P>
<P>
Known as "industrial gourmet powder," rare earth is often added
to other materials to enhance strength.
</P>
<P>
Sectors using rare earth mainly include metallurgy and
machinery, oil and chemicals, glasses and ceramics as well as
agriculture, textiles and light industry.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China's rare earth industry achieved record highs in
production, application and exports of the minerals. It also had
fast growth in 1994.
</P>
<P>
According to government statistics, China produced 48,000 tons
of the mineral products in 1995, representing a 56.6 percent
increase over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, 13,000 tons of rare earth were used across
the country, 18.2 percent more than in 1994.
</P>
<P>
China exported 27,000 tons of rare earth products last year and
earned more than 271 million US dollars in foreign exchanges, up
68.8 percent and 80.9 percent respectively from the figures in
1994.
</P>
<P>
Officials said that China provides more than 70 percent of the
world's rare earth consumption every year.
</P>
<P>
However, the office urged the rare earth producers to explore
domestic applications of rare earth since more than 70 percent of
the Chinese industry relies on overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
The office suggested the rare earth sector should select some
key products to develop and promote for the domestic market. It
also said the sector should turn out more high-tech and high-value
products.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Demands Unconditional Return of Hijacker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States should
unconditionally repatriate a Cuban who hijacked a Cuban civil
plane to the U.S. Navy base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuban Foreign
Minister Roberto Robaina said today.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the hijacker should be returned without
conditions under the terms of a May 1995 bilateral accord on
migration in which the United States agreed to repatriate any
Cuban trying to leave the country illegally by crossing to the
Guantanamo Base.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Washington had no grounds to try a person when
his or her background documents were in Cuba and not in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Cuba would abstain from prejudging the event because the White
House had yet to officially announce any decision on the case,
added the minister.
</P>
<P>
Fernandez Pupo, a former Interior Ministry lieutenant-
colonel who was sacked from his job earlier this year on suspicion
of theft, hijacked the plane last Sunday in eastern Cuba at
gunpoint.
</P>
<P>
The plane, crew and passengers were returned shortly afterwards
to Cuba.

<TEXT>
<P>
The famous Kailuan Coalfield is the first in China to exploit
coal with machines. Tangshan's iron ore is mainly supplied to
Shougang Iron and Steel Company in Beijing and Tangshan Iron Steel
Company.
</P>
<P>
The 100-year old city now has become a major energy resource
and raw material industrial base of China.
</P>
<P>
The city boasts 10 pillar industries covering coal, iron and
steel, electric power, building materials, machinery, chemicals,
porcelain, textiles, paper-making and food processing.
</P>
<P>
Many of the city's state enterprises, such as Kailuan
Coalfield, Douhe Power Plant, Tangshan Iron and Steel Company,
Jidong Cement Works, Tangshan Porcelain Plant, and Tangshan
Rolling Stock Plant, all occupy an important position in their
respective industries in the country.
</P>
<P>
Zhang He said that Tangshan is located in an area along the
Bohai Bay, where economic development has been given great
importance by the central government.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the advantages of Tangshan city, Zhang He said
Tangshan has close relations and exchanges in many circles with
Beijing and Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Tangshan is an important traffic hub, connecting north China
with northeast China. Especially, with the completion of Jingtang
harbor, a joint project between Beijing and Tangshan, the city
will have an important waterway, leading to other countries around
the world.
</P>
<P>
At present, three express highways including one connecting
Beijing with Shenyang, runs through Tangshan, Tianjin-Tangshan and
Tangshan-Jingtang harbor highways are now under construction, and

<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese city that was
"wiped off the face of the earth" by a catastrophic earthquake has
risen from the debris.
</P>
<P>
When the quake hit the north China city of Tangshan in 1976,
the Western media reported that the city had been wiped off the
earth!
</P>
<P>
"However, things did not develop in the logic of western
prophets," said Liang Zhizhong, secretary of the Tangshan City
Committee of the Communist Party of China, in a recent interview
with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake that hit Tangshan registered 7.8 on the Richter
Scale. It left 240,000 people dead, destroyed 14 million square
meters of public buildings, and 5.3 million homes. Financial
losses were estimated at 30 billion yuan (about 3.8 billion US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Liang said a new Tangshan has risen from the debris of the
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
Tangshan now has a population of 1.5 million. The amount of
floor space, grass land, and supplies of heat, gas and running
water for each person, is among the highest in China's large and
medium-sized cities.
</P>
<P>
City mayor Zhang He said that Tangshan is the first city in
Hebei province to install program-controlled telephones. The city
now has some 600,000 such phones, connecting Tangshan with more
than 180 countries and regions worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Zhang He said, Tangshan is rich in natural resources. To the
north of the city is the Yanshan Mountain, where dry and fresh
fruits are very rich; in the southern part of the city along the
Bohai Bay are an important fishing ground and an important sea
saltern in north China. Aquatic product cultivation in the area
has also developed rapidly in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In central parts of Tangshan is a vast plain area, which is a
major commodity grain producer of China.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 varieties of mineral resources including coal,
iron ore, limestone and petroleum have been found under the city.

has been on increase in recent years, which now hits 1.3 million
hectares nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The farmers' increasing enthusiasm for growing the cash crop is
attributed to its high economic value and short growth period.
Another reason is that the farmers can plant other crops alongside
the sunflowers, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Oil extracted from sunflower seeds contains 65 to 73 percent
linoleic acid, far more than other plant oils, and a high

<HEADLINE> New Driving License to be Issued in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Middle-aged car drivers in China
who face driving into the sunset at the age of 60 have been told
to carry on motoring.
</P>
<P>
The country is to issue a new driving license on September 1,
extending the upper age-limit for drivers from 60 to 70.
</P>
<P>
New drivers will also be granted with their licenses as soon as
they pass driving tests. The current one-year-long practice period
has been abandoned, according to the new regulations issued by the
Ministry of Public Security.
</P>
<P>
"It will be easier for Chinese citizens to learn driving and
obtain their driving licenses," said a senior official with the
Ministry of Public Security.
</P>
<P>
With the deepening of China's reform and opening-up policy,
people's living standards are improving drastically, as a result,
driving has been transformed from solely a professional skill, to
the daily needs of ordinary citizens.
</P>
<P>
As a growing number of people apply for licenses, the ministry
has found that the previous regulations could not adapt to the
ever-changing circumstances, hence, the new license.
</P>
<P>
"But the applicants will be faced with more, and stricter road
tests, in a move to ensure that they really master the skills of
driving. " said the official.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 12 (Xinhua) -- China's biggest city, Shanghai,
is to start a charity education program to provide job-training
for displaced workers.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Charity Fund has injected four million yuan into
the program, aiming at offering such training as English lessons,
motor-repair, computer monitoring, as well as pastry making.
</P>
<P>
Unemployed workers, beset by financial difficulties, can pay
half of the tuition fees, and for workers whose per capita monthly
income is lower than a set limit, the lessons are free.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the fund is scheduled to provide no-interest loans
for several small enterprises which have promised to employ those
workers.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Charity Education Center, affiliated to the
Shanghai Charity Fund, has trained over 2,500 replaced workers
during the past two years, 13 percent of them disabled.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 1,500 of them have found new jobs,
accounting for 54 percent of the total.

LANZHOU, July 12 (Xinhua) -- The letters of approval for 17
overseas-funded enterprises in Lanzhou, the capital of northwest
China's Gansu Province have been revoked by the municipal
committee of foreign trade and economic cooperation .
</P>
<P>
The decisions were made after an inspection by local
authorities of the overseas-funded enterprises, all set up before
the end of 1994.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises failed to channel the agreed funds into the
operations in line with the contracts, were engaged in illegal
businesses, cheated with illegal incomes, or "disappeared" after
being registered.
</P>
<P>
There are now 1,061 overseas-funded enterprises in the city,
involving a total investment of 1.3 billion US dollars, and

<HEADLINE> China Courts Urged to Sentence Violent Husbands to Divorce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, July 12 (Xinhua) -- Courts in a Chinese city have
been told to help stamp out domestic violence, by handing out
divorces as punishment for wife-beating husbands.
</P>
<P>
The husbands can also be forced to pay compensation for the
suffering they have caused to their spouses.
</P>
<P>
The new measures follow the launch of China's first
anti-domestic violence association, set up in Tangshan, in Hebei
Province. The city is famous as the scene of an earthquake 20
years ago which killed hundreds of thousands of people.
</P>
<P>
Recent years has seen an increase in domestic violence in the
north China city. According to the Rights and Interests Department
of the Tangshan Municipal Women's Federation, 30 percent of the
372 letters and visitors it received in 1995 were about domestic
violence.
</P>
<P>
To prevent and stop domestic violence, the municipal women's
federation has issued "Regulations for the Prevention and
Stopping of Domestic Violence", jointly with the municipal people's
procuratorate, court and public security bureau.
</P>
<P>
The regulations stipulate that governments at all levels must
pay close attention to the issue of domestic violence, public
security departments must deal seriously with domestic violence
cases, the procuratorates must not let the culprits remain at
large under the pretext of "family troubles", and the courts
should hand down the sentence of divorce and compensation for the
victims when necessary.

<HEADLINE> UK Inflation at Lowest for 2.5 Years in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- British inflation fell to 2.1
percent last month, its lowest level since December 1993 when the
year-on-year rate was 1.9 percent, according to figures released
today by the Office for National Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Headline inflation rose 0.1 percent in June after a 0.2 percent
rise in May, leaving the annual rate in the month at 2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the fall was lower housing costs.
</P>
<P>
However, underlying inflation, the government's benchmark
measure which excludes mortgage interest payments, was unchanged
at a year-on-year rate of 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
In his summer economic forecast, Chancellor Kenneth Clarke
predicted an underlying inflation of 2.5 percent later this year,
but the June figures fanned scepticism about the government's
ability to meet its tough targets.

<P>
ATLANTA, July 11 (Xinhua) -- A top Chinese Olympic official
visited Olympic village mayor Russell Chandler on Thursday, asking
him to add Chinese food to the village's dining hall.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jizhong, gerneral secretary of the Chinese Olympic
Committee, praised the variety and quality of the village food,
but said that it wasn't catering to Chinese tastes.
</P>
<P>
Chandler had tasted so-called Chinese food available at the
village and shook his head, saying that it didn't deserve the name
as Chinese food.
</P>
<P>
The mayor told Wei that he would add more real Chinese food
into the village.
</P>
<P>
Wei noted that 47 Chinese athletes who arrived here on
Wednesday felt comfortable at the air-conditioned village
apartments.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first Olympics which has the air-conditioned
village," Wei said. "But I told the athletes to turn off the
air-conditioner for fear they should get a cold."
</P>
<P>
The most of the Chinese delegation will arrive here on July
15. Those early arrivals are the shooting team and the rowing
squad.

<HEADLINE> New York Stocks Plunge Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Fears for company earnings sent
stocks plunging today as dire outlooks from leading players in
the technology and health care industries worsened a market
already plagued by worries about inflation and interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 83.11 to 5,520.54, its
second big plunge in less than a week.
</P>
<P>
The technology-laden Nasdaq market, stricken by a stream of
negative profit outlooks since early June, flirted with its biggest
point-loss since the stock market crash of October 1987.
</P>
<P>
The day's troubles actually brewed Wednesday evening, when
Hewlett-Packard warned that a sudden slowdown in order growth
would hurt the computer and printer maker's revenue and profits in
the current quarter. The announcement came a day after Motorola
reported second quarter profits that fell well bellow analysts'
expectations.
</P>
<P>
There were more than four declining issues for every gainer on
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume surged to 516.51 million
shares, making it the exchange's sixth-busiest day ever.
</P>
<P>
The 1.5 percent decline in the Dow industrials brought its
retreat to more than 257 points, or 4.5 percent, since its record
5,778.00 of May 22. But the blue-chip average is still up almost
7.9 percent so far this year, more than many analysts had predicted
for all of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index, which has slid more than 11 percent
since setting a record high at 1,249.15 on June 5, fell 34.83 to
1,106.36. Its biggest point drop for a full session was a
46.12-point plunge on Oct. 19, 1987.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index fell 5.11 to 346.64, the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500-stock index fell 10.39 to 645.67, and the American
Stock Exchange's market value index fell 12.72 to 549.09.
</P>
<P>
Bond prices, which often lead stocks higher and lower, rose as
investors fled the stock market.

The Sydney Morning Herald

for five-and-a-half years -- but mainly because fewer people were

The Australian Financial Review

<HEADLINE> Chinese Ambassador on Sustainable Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 11 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Chinese
diplomat said today that although progress of varying degrees has
been made in implementing Agenda 21, the actions already taken by
the world community are far from sufficient.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the fourth session of the Commission on
Sustainable Development, Ambassador Wang Xuexian singled out
several areas that need both attention and actions. Ambassador
Wang is acting Chinese permanent representative to the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
First, he said, the principle of "indivisibility between
environment and development" is yet to be reflected.
</P>
<P>
"The international community is yet to take significant actions
to improve the international economic environment to help the
developing countries achieve economic growth and enhance their
capability for environmental protection," he said.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, he noted, "new and additional financial resources"
remain elusive.
</P>
<P>
"The proportion of official development aid by the developed
countries in their GNP has dropped to the lowest point in 20
years, and there is now a trend of trying to replace `new and
additional financial resources' by `new and innovative funding
mechanism,'" he said.
</P>
<P>
Among others, he added, are the practices by some countries to
use technology as a means to seek economic gains, exercise trade
protectionism under the pretext of environment considerations.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Wang also pointed out that there is a growing trend
of requiring the developing countries to undertake the same
obligations as the developed countries, in disregard of the
limitations from their low levels of economic and technological
development.
</P>
<P>
"In order to reverse these unhealthy trends in international
cooperation in the field of environment and development, the
international community should reaffirm the principles and
objectives adopted at the United Nations Conferences on
Environment and Development and deeply reflect on the experience
and lessons in this regard," he said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it is necessary for the international
community to reiterate the political commitments made at the
Conference on Environment and Development to establish a "new
global partnership" to achieve sustainable development on a global
scale.
</P>
<P>
"Historical experience has told us that international
cooperation without political will can never succeed," he said.

<HEADLINE> UN Council Renews Angola Mission for Another 3 Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
today renewed UN Angola Verification Mission III (UNAVEM III) for
another three months until October 11, 1996.
</P>
<P>
UNAVEM III, which has 7,200 troops, is now the biggest
peacekeeping operation of the world organization.
</P>
<P>
It was established to help implement an agreement signed in
Lusaka, Zambia, in November 1994, ending nearly two decades of
civil war between the Angolan government and former rebels of the
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
In adopting the resolution unanimously, the Security Council
welcomed the progress made so far by the registration of over
52,000 UNITA troops in quartering areas and called upon UNITA to
complete quartering its troops in accordance with an agreed Joint
Commission timetable.
</P>
<P>
The council also urged the government of Angola to take all
necessary steps for completion of the formation of the national
armed forces and urged UNITA to make available for duty the
generals and other high ranking military officers designated to
enter the government forces.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the council meeting, Ambassador Wang Xuexian, the
acting Chinese permanent representative to the United Nations,
urged the Angolan government and UNITA to make full use of the
favorable conditions by the extension of UNAVEM III to accelerate
the peace process with a view to ultimately achieving national
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
"If the two parties in Angola, proceeding from their overall
national interests, can truly remove past grievances, bury the
hatchet, build mutual trust and firmly advance the peace process,
the future of Angola is bound to turn for the better and the
Angolan people will be able to embark on the broad road of
national rejuvenation and development," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Conversely, continued stagnation in the peace process or
even retrogression will let slip peace and tranquillity long
aspired by the Angolan people and land the Angolan nation in
further chaos and misery," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We expect the two parties, particularly UNITA, to live up to
the wishes of the Angolan people and the international community
by making a choice in line with the historical requirements and a
political decision in the interests of the Angolan nation," he
said.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR: Bosnian Refugees Repatriation Process Slow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The process of repatriation of
Bosnian refugees has been unsuccessful so far, with only 10,000
people having returned to their homes, said spokesman for the UN
High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Banja Luka Mans Nyberg
today.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference in Banja Luka, the largest city in
Republika Srpska, that since the beginning of the implementation
of the Dayton agreement last December, about 100,000 people had
returned to their homes.
</P>
<P>
But at the same period, "90,000 people have left their homes
and become new refugees, of whom mostly from Sarajevo, which
altogether meant unsatisfactory results," the Tanjug news agency
quoted Nyberg as saying in Banja Luka.
</P>
<P>
Before Sarajevo was unified in mid-March, more than 70,000
Serbs living in the city had fled their homes for fear of
retaliation after Serb-held Sarajevo was put under the rule of the
Muslim-Croat federation.
</P>
<P>
Nyberg said that accommodation was the main obstacle to the
repatriation process, because houses were either destroyed or
inhabited by "other people."
</P>
<P>
During the three-and-half-year-long war in Bosnia, more than 2
million people have become refugees and displaced persons, of whom
1 million are staying in Bosnia, 700,000 are housed in Yugoslavia
and another 700,000 have sought asylum in other countries outside
the Balkan region.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Serb towns in central and north Bosnia,
including Banja Luka, Sipovo and Mrkonjic Grad, were among the 19
areas in which houses would start to be reconstructed.
</P>
<P>
That would allow a return of 145,000 people, Nyberg said,
adding that the goal was to reconstruct as many houses as possible
before winter came so that more people could move into new houses.
</P>
<P>
He also said the UNHCR had organized a daily bus transport for
about 1,000 people from the Serb to the Muslim-Croat entity and
vice versa so that freedom of movement between the two entities
would gradually become a reality in Bosnia.

"The significance of these specific agreements are that they
set up the further implementation of the agreed framework
between the United States and the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea," he said.
</P>
<P>
The three protocols cover issues on transportation,
communication and diplomatic privileges and immunities.
</P>
<P>
"They accord specific privileges and immunities that will
permit KEDO to carry out the light-water reactor project in
North Korea, they establish ways of communication for KEDO to
carry out its functions in moving that project forward, as well
as providing for means of transportation both to North Korea,
and then once arriving either by sea or by air, into North Korea
to the actual reactor site," he said.
</P>
<P>
Bosworth told Reuter that the negotiations between the DPRK and
the KEDO, a U.S.-led consortium representing the United States,
Japan and South Korea, "proceeded in a very positive and
business-like fashion."
</P>
<P>
He said that 10 to 12 protocols would be necessary in the
next two to 2-1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on two other protocols, which include the
process by which the KEDO will take over the proposed site, will
begin in the DPRK later this month, the first time for the
negotiations to be held there.

<HEADLINE> Democrats Set More Moderate Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- Democrats produced today a
theme-setting draft of their platform for the August convention,
that strives for a "moderate, achievable" agenda for a potential
second Clinton term.
</P>
<P>
The document reasserted the need to cut big government, fight
crime and expand educational opportunity. Some of the
ambitiousness of 1992 is gone, with affordable health care defined
as a goal instead of a universal right, The Associated Press
reported from Kansas City, Missouri.
</P>
<P>
The draft spelled out "concrete, achievable steps rather than
the more sweeping steps," said Ann Lewis, speaking for the Clinton
campaign.
</P>
<P>
The 26-page text was written by the campaign, the Democratic
National Committee and congressional Democrats and may see some
changes before going to the party's convention next month.
</P>
<P>
The draft called abortion rights a "fundamental constitutional
liberty" in keeping with the party's core position on the issue.
</P>
<P>
But it added language similar to that proposed by anti-abortion
congressional Democrats designed to placate that minority wing of
the party and head off a Republican-style fight on abortion
policy.
</P>
<P>
Republicans are struggling to find an accommodation of their
own that will make room for supporters of abortion rights in their
anti-abortion policy.
</P>
<P>
The draft welcomed legal immigrants and said illegal aliens
must be stopped. Illegal immigrants should not get welfare but
their children should be allowed in schools, it said.
</P>
<P>
The drafting committee, made up of 16 federal, state and local
politicians, union leaders and others, was charged with drawing
the first formal draft to be presented to the separate platform
committee. Members mainly suggested cursory changes to the text to
them.
</P>
<P>
It packaged White House and congressional plans to balance the
budget by 2002, defend Medicare and Medicaid, encourage public
school choice, give scholarships to top high school students,
provide a 10,000-dollar tax deduction for post-secondary education
and try again to reform welfare.
</P>
<P>
On health care, the draft spoke of helping people between jobs
pay their premiums, stopping companies from denying insurance to
sick people an expanding access.

<HEADLINE> US F-16 Crashes in Florida </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- An Air Force F-16 fighter jet
crashed today into a house in suburban Pensacola, Florida, the
Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
The pilot ejected safely from the plane about two miles from
the Pensacola municipal airport.
</P>
<P>
The F-16's single engine failed about 20 miles north of
Pensacola and the pilot tried to take it into the airport on an
emergency landing, the Air Force said.
</P>
<P>
The plane, which was based at Shaw Air Force Base in Sumpter,
North Carolina, was en route to Eglin Air Force Base in the
Florida Panhandle as part of an evacuation for Hurricane Bertha
which is approaching the North Carolina coast.
</P>
<P>
The plane burned together with the house it hit. A CNN report
said one child was missing and a woman was hospitalized.

<HEADLINE> Dole Assures Netanyahu Strong Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Republican
presidential candidate Bob Dole promised today to Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that there would be a stronger
U.S.-Israel relationship under a Dole administration.
</P>
<P>
In a brief meeting with Netanyahu in Manhattan, Dole stressed
the strong ties between the United States and Israel would
continue regardless of the outcome of the U.S. presidential
election in November.
</P>
<P>
"I think it will be stronger under a Dole administration.
Frankly when it comes to missile defense, when it comes to putting
pressure on Syria, trying to isolate Iran," he added.
</P>
<P>
Dole also assured his strong support for an undivided
Jerusalem. "I've held the same view for some time," he told
reporters after their meeting.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu claimed in Wednesday's Congress speech that he would
never allow a redivision of the Holy City, which immediately
incurred criticism from the Palestinian Authority, saying he was
"lying."
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said he "wasn't preaching" in his meeting with Dole
and it just showed "a complete unity."

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Africa Prepares for 21st Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 11 (Xinhua) -- For the first time, African
leaders rang a crisis bell at their annual gathering to better
prepare the continent for entering the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an atmosphere of unity was everywhere in the 32nd
summit of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) held from July
8 to 10, during which African leaders discussed a wide range of
regional issues concerning stability and development of the
continent.
</P>
<P>
"The gravity of Africa's political and economic crisis is an
indisputable fact that gives no room for optimism," said the
Yaounde declaration released at the end of the summit closed here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"We are resolved, at this dawn of the 21st century, to create
conditions to enable Africa to take up the challenges facing it,
which, if unresolved, could jeopardize the future of the
continent for a long time to come," it said.
</P>
<P>
Africa's economy is in crisis, cried out the leaders.
"Compared to other developing continents, such as Latin America
and Asia, Africa is lagging far behind economically and is the
most under-developed continent of the world," according to the
Yaounde declaration.
</P>
<P>
In light of this, agreements were unanimously reached,
especially on ways to step up the regional integration process.
</P>
<P>
The summit decided to inaugurate, by the end of October, the
much-delayed Economic and Social Committee (ECOSOC) which is the
engine to start the building process of the African Economic
Community (AEC).
</P>
<P>
The agreement is key to the delayed implementation of the
Abuja treaty which, effective on May 12, 1994, provides that the
community be finally established by 2025, five years after the
creation of the African common market.
</P>
<P>
There is also the crisis of external debt and food security.
taking full notice of this, the OAU summit agreed to take an
African common stance in tackling the issues, the result of which
they say are key to Africa's economic future.
</P>
<P>
The external debt, which rose to a record 320 billion US
Dollars by the end of 1995, is the "most serious single
bottleneck" which blocks Africa's effort to make an economic
breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
And Africa, the only continent where agricultural production
per capita has been declining over the past 20 years, has long
been exploited by the unfair international trade system.

<P>
YAOUNDE, July 11 (Xinhua) -- The continent is still in its
poitical crisis where the hot spots, though cooling down a bit
recently, are still threatening the regional peace and security,
African leaders say.
</P>
<P>
But this time, the African leaders chose to keep a low profile
on some of the critical but sensitive issues, especially
concerning the inter-state conflict and the hot spots still at
war.
</P>
<P>
To everybody's surprise, the summit has neither produced any
resolution on Burundi, Rwanda, Liberia, Somalia and Sierra Leone,
nor made any statement on questions ranging from the
Nigerian-Cameroonian land dispute of the Bakassi Peninsula to the
Rwandan-Zairese quarrel on refugees.
</P>
<P>
"The less noise made, the more helpful," said OAU Secretary
General Salim Ahmed Salim.
</P>
<P>
"These issues were neither on the OAU summit agenda nor being
neglected. The heads of state and government decide to employ a
quiet diplomacy in resolving the issues," he noted.
</P>
<P>
But this does not necessary mean that the peacekeeping and
maintaining role of the OAU is diminishing.
</P>
<P>
Instead of establishing a permanent peacekeeping task force,
the OAU chose to strengthen the already existing mechanism for
conflict prevention, management and resolution with the resources
at hand.
</P>
<P>
It also moved to create a pre-emptive system within the
mechanism, which, by information exchange and diplomatic
mediation, endeavored to resolve the crisis before it is
escalated to an uncontrollable scale.
</P>
<P>
Management of the social crisis was most easily agreed upon.
Top on the agenda of the OAU summit are a series of social issues
ranging from education to health care.
</P>
<P>
Among the 10 resolutions adopted by the OAU summit, six are
tackling the social crisis, including checking the rampant spread
of HIV/AIDS, protecting the human rights, protecting the
environment, assistance to the pan-African telecommunication
union, the launching of the decade of education in Africa, and on
bioethics.
</P>
<P>
In a major show of African unity, the OAU declared the African
candidature of incumbent United Nations Secretary General Dr.
Boutros Boutros-Ghali for a second term of his office, despite
the opposition and lobby by the United States government against
him.
</P>
<P>
In another show of Africa-Arab kinsmanship at a time when the
middle east peace process has been stalled, the OAU also made a
unanimous declaration supporting the Palestinian struggle for
their national rehabilitation and the middle east peace.
</P>
<P>
Both Boutros-Ghali and Yassir Arafat were in Yaounde for
attendance of the OAU summit.
</P>
<P>
A total of 31 African heads of state attended the summit, much
more than expected, which somehow showed the unity displayed by
the African leaders and the confidence they gave in the regional
body.
</P>
<P>
"Together we fight, divided we fall," goes a slogan of the
Yaounde summit.
</P>
<P>
"As Africa in crisis strive to promote peace and development,
we should not be caught entering the new millennium unprepared,"
Salim raised the alarm in his statement to the OAU summit.
</P>
<P>
In crisis, Africa is fighting an uphill war against the
adversity.
</P>
<P>
And United, Africa can gain a better position in entering the
21st century.

<HEADLINE> IFOR General: NATO Troops to Remain in Bosnia in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 11 (Xinhua) -- A NATO-led peace Implementation
Force (IFOR) general said today he believed the IFOR would remain
in Bosnia after its term expired on December 20.
</P>
<P>
British General John Kiszely, the IFOR commander for Sector
Southwest, said in Banja Luka, the Serb city in northwestern
Bosnia, that personally he would be surprised if the IFOR did not
stay after December 20 and he would also be surprised if these
troops did not include British soldiers.
</P>
<P>
He said in the next six months the IFOR would change its role
somewhat to help international organizations which were
implementing the civilian part of the peace agreement -- the
office of the High Representative for civilian affairs Carl Bildt,
the International Police Task Force, the Organization for Security
and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) and others.
</P>
<P>
Kiszely, who came to Bosnia to replace Gen. Mike Jackson only
two weeks ago, said the IFOR's other major role was to help the
reconstruction of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"The IFOR is taking part in about 200 projects, of which about
70 are health-related, 70 for the reconstruction of the waterworks
and sanitary installations, and about 60 for schools," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Our engineers are rebuilding bridges and roads and so far we
have invested more than 1 million German marks (660,000 US
dollars) in this," Kiszely said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the IFOR would also play an important role at the
OSCE-organized September elections in Bosnia which would be held
at 4,000 polling stations in the presence of 2,000 controllers and
12,000 observers.
</P>
<P>
"The IFOR's task is to secure transports, communications and
links, and to secure the elections," he said.
</P>
<P>
The first post-war elections in Bosnia, to be organized and
monitored by the OSCE, is regarded as the crucial step towards a
lasting peace and reconciliation in the war-torn country.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Unveils School Construction Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today unveiled a 5-billion-dollar four-year school construction
program to patch decaying schools across the country.
</P>
<P>
The United States is trying to make progress in educating its
young people, Clinton said in a White House Rose Garden event, and
"all this progress is at risk if our children are asked to learn
in a landscape that is littered with peeling paint and broken
glass."
</P>
<P>
The program, which needs congressional approval, comes two
weeks after the General Accounting Office (GAO) reported that
hundreds of school buildings nationwide were in poor condition and
need to be repaired.
</P>
<P>
The GAO said in many schools, buildings are as old as 75 years.
About 67 percent of inner-city schools, serving nearly 10 million
students, reported the need to repair or replace pluming, heating
or foundations.
</P>
<P>
Under Clinton's proposal, the 5 billion dollars in federal
funding will be provided to local school districts over the next
four years to subsidize the cost of construction loans. The
subsidy will run as high as 50 percent of the interest rate.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration hoped the fund would support some 20
billion dollars in new school construction and renovation projects
at 5,000 to 10,000 schools.
</P>
<P>
School districts nationwide currently spend between 10 billion
and 11 billion dollars a year on renovation and new construction,
but a nationwide survey last year showed that it would cost 111
billion dollars to repair or upgrade schools.
</P>
<P>
On the source of revenue of the fund, the White House said
Clinton was proposing a one-time auction of the rights to use the
broadcast frequencies located between channels 60 and 69 on the
current television dial.

<HEADLINE> UK Inflation at Lowest for 2.5 Years in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 11 (Xinhua) -- British inflation fell to 2.1
percent last month, its lowest level since December 1993 when the
year-on-year rate was 1.9 percent, according to figures released
today by the Office for National Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Headline inflation rose 0.1 percent in June after a 0.2 percent
rise in May, leaving the annual rate in the month at 2.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the fall was lower housing costs.
</P>
<P>
However, underlying inflation, the government's benchmark
measure which excludes mortgage interest payments, was unchanged
at a year-on-year rate of 2.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
In his summer economic forecast, Chancellor Kenneth Clarke
predicted an underlying inflation of 2.5 percent later this year,
but the June figures fanned scepticism about the government's
ability to meet its tough targets.
