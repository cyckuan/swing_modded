NO SURPRISE, AS WILLIAMS WINS HEISMAN TROPHY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   College football's most coveted prize looked lonely in that
trophy case. That's what the 18-year-old Californian was thinking
four years ago as he gazed at Earl Campbell's 1977 Heisman, kept
behind glass at the University of Texas. His name was Ricky
Williams. He was a would-be Longhorn running back on a recruiting
trip.
</P>
<P>
   Williams made his prospective coaches a promise right then and
there. Bring him to Austin and he would win another bronze statue
to go with Campbell's.
</P>
<P>
   He kept that promise Saturday night at the Downtown Athletic
Club in New York City, where he was named the 1998 Heisman Trophy
winner by the fourth-largest margin of victory in the 64-year
history of the award.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't grow up dreaming of playing in the NFL,'' Williams
said. ``I grew up dreaming of playing college football. This is a
very special moment.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams captured 2,355 points and was the overwhelming first
choice in all six voting regions. Kansas State quarterback Michael
Bishop was second with 792 points, UCLA's Cade McNown was third
with 696 and Kentucky's Tim Couch fourth with 527 points.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' 714 first-place votes, to 41 for Bishop, were the
third-most in the award's history, behind O.J. Simpson in 1968 and
Charlie Ward in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   As a freshman, Williams was cocky enough to make
``heisman(AT)UT'' part of his e-mail address, even though he was a
blocking and pass-catching fullback in a pro-style offense that
first year. He was hurt enough last year at not being invited to
New York for the Heisman ceremony _ despite being the nation's
leading rusher in his junior season _ that he thought of turning
professional.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams returned for his senior year and finished it owning
all or part of 16 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division
I records, including most career rushing yards _ 6,279 _ which Tony
Dorsett held for 22 years until Williams' final game of the 1998
season.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest achievement, however, may be expanding the
perception of how a Heisman Trophy winner looks and acts. He looks
like an art student off the field with the dreadlocks, the stud in
his tongue and the four tattoos, the most colorful being the Mighty
Mouse on his arm. But on the field, Williams is a 6-foot-1-inch,
225-pound bulldozer who prefers to use his 4.3-second speed in the
40-yard dash to run over defenders, rather than around them.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Williams is a gifted athlete who spends summers as an outfielder
in the Philadelphia Phillies organization, but whose eventual goal
is to put an education degree to work teaching elementary school.
He speaks engagingly of the evolution of the reggae star Bob
Marley, but is just as enthusiastic while discussing the legacy of
Doak Walker, the 1948 Heisman winner whom Williams befriended a
year ago and helped comfort during his paralysis after a skiing
accident. Walker died this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so humble,'' Williams said, remembering Walker on the
50th anniversary of the former Southern Methodist star's Heisman
victory. ``He kept fighting back through good and bad. It's the way
I want to live my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams even wants to change what the Heisman Trophy means. He
shrugged off the fact that the trophy was college football's
greatest individual honor. ``I disagree,'' he said. ``It's a team
award. You can't become a finalist without the effort and hard work
of the whole team. The best part of this whole season is that I was
part of a Texas team that won eight games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas teams in Williams' freshman and sophomore years were
better, but this year's Longhorns _ 8-3 and Cotton Bowl-bound _ are
his favorite. He decided to return for his senior year last January
after a lunch with the new coach, Mack Brown, and a moving
experience at his church in San Diego over the Christmas break.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who built a national power at North Carolina, assured him
only that the Longhorns would be disciplined and committed to
reversing the 4-7 record of the year before. Not a word was said
about the number of carries Williams might get or a push for the
Heisman Trophy. It was what Williams wanted to hear; he had come
into Texas with a 10-2-1 Sugar Bowl team and wanted to go out with
a winning record.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bishop Joel Trout delivered a sermon at the North Park
Apostolic Church that straightened Williams up in his pew. It was
about the grass not always being greener on the other side. ``It
made me think that I was pretty happy where I was,'' Williams said.
``Why would I need to get more when I really don't need it, and
risk being unhappy?'' He liked school. He liked his frequent visits
to children's hospitals and elementary schools. He liked being a
Longhorn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned a lot about life, about football, about dealing
with people,'' he said. ``You really do grow up in college.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Texas began the season 1-2 after blowout losses to UCLA
and Kansas State. Entering the season, Williams acknowledged that
any Heisman hopes he had were compromised by what most considered a
rebuilding year for Texas. He even lamented that the Heisman had
come down to recognizing ``the best player on the best team.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the season, the three other players who would become
Heisman finalists _ all quarterbacks _ gained momentum that
threatened to knock Williams out. McNown was leading comebacks and
amassing 3,130 yards and 23 touchdowns as the Bruins maintained a
perfect record until the final week of the season. Likewise, Bishop
was putting up terrific numbers _ 2,844 yards and 23 touchdown
passes, 14 more touchdowns on runs _ until the Wildcats' perfect
season was ruined in the Big 12 championship game.
</P>
<P>
   Couch, a junior, went overland for 4,275 passing yards and 36
touchdowns in an all-out passing attack dubbed Air Raid.
</P>
<P>
   But the Longhorns quietly regrouped, reeling off six straight
victories, because Brown turned Williams' Heisman campaign into a
team crusade. They upset Nebraska, 20-16, in Lincoln behind
Williams' 150 yards and a touchdown-saving tackle he made on an
interception, which turned the game around.
</P>
<P>
   Cornhusker fans were so impressed that many stayed to give
Williams a standing ovation as he left the field.
</P>
<P>
   The Longhorns beat Oklahoma in a game made more poignant by
Williams, who received permission to wear No. 37 _ Walker's number
_ at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas, where the SMU star played his home
games.
</P>
<P>
   At halftime in a tight game against Oklahoma State, Brown
apologized to Williams for abandoning the running game to ride the
hot hand of the freshman quarterback, Major Applewhite. ``He told
me that we talked too much about his individual records,'' Brown
said. ``Then he went over to our offensive coordinator and told him
to keep throwing the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there was the afternoon Williams broke Dorsett's
record, in the last game of the regular season against a blood
rival, Texas A&AMP;M, at Darrell K. Royal Texas Memorial Stadium. He
came in needing 63 yards. He told Brown that because the record run
would be replayed for years, he wanted a long one. One with style.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the first quarter, Williams burst 60 yards, first
inside, then out. The record fell with Dorsett cheering on the
sideline and thousands of Longhorn-hating Aggies reluctantly
clapping along. Williams ended the day with 259 yards, and the
Longhorns ended it with a 26-24 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, Ricky has called his own shots everywhere along the
way,'' Brown said. ``I never will doubt him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Heisman voters didn't, either, as they helped him make good
on his promise to give Campbell's trophy a twin in the Texas trophy
room. &QL;

A DESPERATE DISHING OUT OF BIG DOUGH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The story's as old as the Hollywood Hills. A
fading member of the old guard lavishes cash and courtesies on the
latest hot young thing, buying that which he no longer can
effortlessly attract.
</P>
<P>
   That could have been some gilded geezer's cologne we smelled
Saturday around Dodger Stadium, so pungent was the scent of
desperation. There certainly was nothing subtle about the doddering
Dodgers' courtship of uber free agent Kevin Brown. That wasn't a
romance they finally consummated, it was a conquest.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, on the rebound after a couple of very public
rejections, went to absurd lengths to prove they haven't lost their
appeal. They showered Brown, the right-handed ace of San Diego's
World Series staff, with $105 million, a seventh season and a
private plane for a dozen quick hops home to Macon, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that with the money they threw at him, Brown could
buy his own corporate jet. Forget that he will be 40 years old in
the final year of his contract, which is, like, 84 in pitching
years.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, 33, was able to demand the sun, the moon, the stars and a
no-trade clause for pretty much the same reasons the latest hot
young thing can extract diamonds from a sugar daddy. Brown had in
the Dodgers a suitor with deep pockets and a deepening feeling of
vulnerability.
</P>
<P>
   The once-proud franchise had been spurned twice in the past few
months alone, by manager Felipe Alou and left-handed pitcher Randy
Johnson. There was no way the Dodgers could afford to strike out
swinging at the negotiating table, no matter how much money it
took.
</P>
<P>
   Not if they wanted to save face.
</P>
<P>
   Not if they wanted to stave off the annexation of the Southland
by the Angels, who signed slugger Mo Vaughn and are pursuing a
trade for pitcher Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Not if Rupert Murdoch, whose Fox Group bought the team earlier
this year, had any say in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, ego drove the Dodgers where they had emphatically
refused to tread in the early days of Fox's ownership. Five months
after the team dealt catcher Mike Piazza to Florida rather than
dignify his $100 million musings, the Dodgers locked Brown up for
every penny of Piazza's asking price and more.
</P>
<P>
   Say what you want about Piazza, whose seven-year, $91 million
deal with the New York Mets all of a sudden seems pretty puny, but
at least he is an everyday player. Brown will grace the mound every
fourth or fifth game. All in all, not a bad way to go to earn so
much dough.
</P>
<P>
   We'll grant Brown this: He's a proven winner, having advanced to
the World Series with his last two teams. That's more than can be
said for Piazza, whose next postseason win will be his first. Brown
is also a fiery leader in the clubhouse, a role Piazza was loath to
assume.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers will be a markedly better team with Brown in the
short run. The team's staying power, however, will depend on the
staying power of Brown's arm and therein lies the rub. General
manager Kevin Malone was quick to point out that among pitchers in
the '90s, Brown and Atlanta ace Greg Maddux have been the most
durable.
</P>
<P>
   His point was that Brown is blessed with a rubber arm. Our worry
is that his arm is a ticking time bomb that could explode with his
very next 97 mile-per-hour fastball.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are committed to paying Brown twice what National
League champion San Diego doled out in players' salaries during its
1998 dream season. Brown collected $4.8 million in his only year
with the Padres, who offered him $60 million over six years to stay
awhile.
</P>
<P>
   In October that figure would have been in the ballpark. Since
then the fences have been stretched by baseball's haves to the
point where the have-nots are starting to feel as though they're
trapped in one of those fun houses with the distorted mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   It's a little disorienting for everybody concerned to consider
that in less time than it takes the average household to pick its
Thanksgiving turkey carcass clean, the average yearly salary of the
highest-paid player in baseball has jumped from $13 to $15 million.
You'd have to go all the way back to Bob Beamon's 1968 Olympic
effort to find a single leap that astounding.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is not pro sports' first $100 million man. Five NBA
players already have cracked that barrier. Not coincidentally, the
NBA is in limbo right now, the players having been locked out by
owners adamant about creating some sort of ceiling for the
spiraling salaries. In 2002, that could be baseball.
</P>
<P>
   John Moores, the Padres' majority owner, said the Dodgers' offer
to Brown ``confirms my worst fears about what would happen if we
let Murdoch buy the Dodgers.''
</P>
<P>
   The worst fear of any Dodgers fan is that Brown will turn out to
be like another pitcher, Don Gullett, who signed for big bucks as a
free agent with the Yankees in 1977 and then hurt his arm and was
out of baseball two years later.
</P>
<P>
   Of course there'll always be another arm from whence Brown's
came. As long as there's another team willing to pay through the
nose for it, baseball's future is in trouble. &QL;

DODGERS SIGN BROWN, ANOTHER HUGE SPORTS DEAL FOR L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL A. ANASTASI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
  LOS ANGELES _ Now, anything less than a world championship is
failure.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Dodgers became baseball's first team to guarantee a player
$100 million Saturday when they signed Kevin Brown _ the game's
premier free-agent pitcher _ to a seven-year, $105 million
contract.
</P>
<P>
   The deal utterly stunned, though not necessarily surprised,
baseball administrators gathered in Nashville, Tenn., this week for
their annual winter meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, the American sports jewel of Rupert Murdoch's
empire, raised their payroll to about $80 million annually, 10
times what the Montreal Expos paid their team this past season. The
$105 million also represents 30 percent of what Murdoch paid to buy
the Dodgers from Peter O'Malley.
</P>
<P>
   And like Shaquille O'Neal and even Wayne Gretzky before him,
Brown's arrival in Los Angeles brings the expectation of
professional sport played at its most elite level.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, incoming Dodgers manager Davey Johnson named Brown
his Opening Day starter. ``I would have to say,'' Johnson said,
``we're the favorites to win the division.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who turns 34 during spring training, should face Randy
Johnson, himself just signed to a $52.4 million contract by the
Arizona Diamondbacks, on April 5 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Brown _ whose contract includes a no-trade clause and perks such
as a personal hotel suite for road trips and the use of a corporate
jet 12 times a year so that his wife and two sons may visit from
their Atlanta-area home _ is to be introduced at Dodger Stadium on
Tuesday. He issued only a statement on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am looking forward to being part of the re-establishment of
a winning tradition,'' he said. ``(The Dodgers ownership) made it
clear that they plan on being competitive year in and year out.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, 139-99 lifetime, has just one 20-win season in his 12
years in the major leagues, has never won a Cy Young Award, and
will be 40 years old when his contract expires in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Only five pitchers in the game's history, including Cy Young who
had 20, have won at least 15 games at that age. The legendary Bob
Gibson, 22-9 with a 1.12 earned-run average when he was 33 like
Brown, was 3-10 by the time he was 40.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Brown, who possesses a 94 mph sinking fastball, is 51-26 the
last three seasons and led both the Florida Marlins and San Diego
Padres to the World Series the last two. And only he and Atlanta's
Greg Maddux have thrown more than 1,400 innings over the last seven
years.
</P>
<P>
   His ultimate value, though, transcends dominant numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The four-time All-Star is known as a fierce competitor who plays
his best when the stakes are at their highest. Against the Atlanta
Braves, the National League's juggernaut of the 1990s, Brown is 6-0
with a 1.85 ERA in his last eight starts and, moreover, is 3-0 in
NL Championship Series games he's started against that team.
</P>
<P>
   Like Kirk Gibson _ who justified his free-agent signing by the
Dodgers to a then-rich, three-year contract as a 31-year-old with a
single at-bat in the 1988 World Series _ Brown raises the level of
play of those around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``(He) has a huge winning impact on all his teammates,
especially the other pitchers on the staff,'' Dodgers general
manager and executive vice president Kevin Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The signing of Brown brings us a quality No.1 starter with
power, durability, leadership, and most importantly, the desire and
passion to win.''
</P>
<P>
   With a front three of Brown, Chan Ho Park and Darren Dreifort,
the Dodgers' pitching rotation is impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Among the five teams pursuing Brown were the Disney-owned
Angels, who on Nov. 25 signed Mo Vaughn to what then set baseball's
high for average annual salary, $13.33 under a six-year, $80
million agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Brown averages $15 million annually. His total salary eclipses
the previous high of $91 million, set by Mike Piazza and the New
York Mets on Oct. 23. Ironically, it was Piazza's demand for a $100
deal from the Dodgers that led to his trade this past summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers do not instantly become baseball's best team. They
ranked last in the league in runs scored this season and only have
taken modest steps to improve in that area, most significantly with
the Dec. 1 acquisition of catcher Todd Hundley in a trade with the
Mets.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers outfield is outstanding, but they have an unproven
third baseman in Adrian Beltre and a poor defensive shortstop with
Mark Grudzielanek. Other offseason acquisitions have brought
journeymen.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Malone is confident Brown's signing is the key to
pushing the Dodgers from the solid, yet generally underperforming
level of recent seasons to that of genuinely contending for a
championship.
</P>
<P>
   So much so, in fact, that Malone was willing to face his
colleagues' universal condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an affront to baseball,'' said Sandy Alderson, an
executive vice president in the commissioner's office, reflecting
similar comments made by many of the sport's leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Said Malone: ``If we didn't do it, and that doesn't justify it,
but somebody else was going to do it.'' &QL;

DODGERS HIT BROWN JACKPOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Showing that money was no object, the Dodgers
signed free-agent pitcher Kevin Brown on Saturday to a seven-year
deal worth $105 million, setting the baseball world on its ear.
</P>
<P>
   Both the total value of the contract and average annual salary
($15 million per season) are the highest in baseball history,
drawing criticism from many in the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can say is as a former general manager (with the Oakland
A's) I'm alarmed by the contract,'' Sandy Alderson said in
Nashville, Tenn., where baseball's winter meetings are taking
place. ``As a member of the commissioner's office, I'm alarmed by
this contract, and as a fan of the game, I'd be alarmed by this
contract.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown will receive a $5 million signing bonus, $10 million in
1999 and $15 million each season from 2000 to 2005. He also has
incentive bonuses in the contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, put in a situation of having to defend themselves
for becoming an instant World Series contender, point to Brown's
durability and the fact that he has pitched in the World Series in
each of the past two seasons with different teams (Florida in 1997
and San Diego this past season). The Dodgers haven't been to the
World Series since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Kevin is unique and special in the regard that he is
without question the most durable pitcher in the major leagues,''
Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said. ``Kevin Brown is one of
those special players who is capable of elevating a team into a
championship team.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who lives in Macon, Ga., with his wife and two children,
also received a clause in his contract that provides a corporate
jet for 12 round-trips a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think Kevin Brown is a big part of our future,'' Malone
said. ``We're comfortable with the terms. We feel like we logically
evaluated the marketplace. We needed the player, we wanted the
player and we made the commitment to our fans to becoming a winning
team.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to being part of the re-establishment of a
winning tradition,'' Brown told the Orange County Register. ``I'm
excited I will be there to see that happen.''
</P>
<P>
   New Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said Brown, who turns 34 on
March 14, will be his Opening Day starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that when I read the January, February sports
magazines, I'm sure they'll have the Dodgers pretty high,'' Johnson
said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown joins Chan Ho Park, Darren Dreifort, Ismael Valdes and
Carlos Perez in the Dodgers' starting rotation. Dave Mlicki also
figures into the mix.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels, Orioles, Cardinals and Rockies were among the
finalists for Brown, but none of those teams offered him more than
six years. Brown will be 40 in the seventh and final year of his
contract in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was 18-7 with a 2.38 ERA for the Padres last season and is
139-99 in his 12-year career. He has won 20 games in a season only
once _ in 1992 with the Rangers when he went 21-11 and was the
American League's starting pitcher in the All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin Brown is a winning pitcher. Kevin Brown has the ability
to take a good team and make it a championship team. Kevin Brown
took a team to the World Series in 1997 and was in it again in
'98,'' Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin Brown is arguably the best pitcher in the game and all I
can say is championships are won with pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown's mental toughness and approach to the game also attracted
the Dodgers, according to Brown's Newport Beach-based agent, Scott
Boras.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted a mentality that is completely different from the
prior ownership,'' Boras said. ``It's not going to be, `Hey dude.'
It's going to be, `You better win or walk.' That's what Kevin
brings to a locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows the value of a No.1 pitcher. The premium is
Kevin Brown has taken a good club and put it in the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   The signing was the third by the Dodgers this offseason. They
signed center fielder Devon White to a three-year, $12.4 million
contract and right-handed reliever Alan Mills to a three-year, $6.5
million deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' payroll stands at $71.8 million for 1999, but there
are several players eligible for arbitration, which would push the
payroll by opening day to approximately $80 million.

ALEDO SECURES FIRST STATE FOOTBALL TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC ZARATE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Give it too much room, and Aledo's defense is prone to
make a few mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Put their backs near the goal line, and it's another matter.
</P>
<P>
   Back-to-back sacks shut the door on Cuero with 1:32 remaining to
give the Bearcats the Class 3A Division I state title, 14-7,
yesterday at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Aledo (13-1) wins its first football championship in the
school's second title-game appearance. The first was in 1974. Cuero
(11-4) has three state titles, and was in its ninth final since
1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a bend-but-don't-break defense,'' Aledo coach Tim
Buchanan said. ``We put on a big pass rush there at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bearcats scored the go-ahead touchdown on running back Matt
Saunders' 2-yard run with 2:45 left in the game. Aledo executed a
5-minute, 50-second drive that covered 73 yards in 17 plays. The
Bearcats converted two fourth-down plays along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Cuero got its final opportunity when Derrick Buchanan returned a
short kickoff 35 yards to the Aledo 45. A 20-yard pass from Andrew
Heard to Albert Wade moved the ball to the Bearcats 25.
</P>
<P>
   After two incompletions, cornerback Will Sadler sacked Heard for
an 18-yard loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went inside, so I had to watch for anything coming out of
the backfield,'' Sadler said. ``I thought he was about to throw it,
but I got him.''
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Lucas Turner tackled Heard for a 7-yard loss on
fourth-and-28 at the Bearcats 43.
</P>
<P>
   Aledo got the ball back at midfield, and picked up a first down
to run out the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a double-team,'' Turner said of his sack. ``I went
inside of both of them, and ripped the quarterback. Their offense
was great. They'd make a big play, then we'd stick our heads in
there and make a bigger play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bearcats defense recorded four sacks, and six other tackles
behind the line. In the second half, Cuero's offense was limited to
50 yards and five first downs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them the best football team they'd see all year was
Cuero, and there was no doubt about it,'' coach Buchanan said.
``The defense won the football game.''
</P>
<P>
   Aledo outgained Cuero, 237-197. Quarterback Joel Laminack
completed 13 of 28 for 158 yards, with one interception. Wide
receiver Donald Hays caught five for 57. Running quarterback
Cameron Hill gained 33 yards on eight carries.
</P>
<P>
   After a scoreless first half, Aledo got on the board first with
3:51 remaining in the third quarter when Laminack ran the ball in
from the Cuero 34. Operating out of the shotgun formation, Laminack
took advantage of a huge hole up the middle for the touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Cuero cornerback Delrick Washington picked off Laminack's pass
at the Aledo 23 with 51 seconds left in the third, and Heard
connected with receiver Sean Cullen 47 seconds later for a 19-yard
score that tied the game, 7-7.
</P>
<P>
   After that, a long drive and stout defense earned Aledo the
title.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't really do anything special,'' Tim Buchanan said.
``It was a great team effort. You might just call it luck.''

STEPHENVILLE SLIPS PAST CARROLL TO HIT 4A DIVISION II FINAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TROY PHILLIPS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Carroll quarterback Nathan Chandler perhaps had
the most astute reaction to Stephenville's 31-28 circus victory in
last night's Class 4A Division II semifinal game at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler, Carroll's capable 6-foot-6 passer, also summed up the
firepower Stephenville's offense regularly has at its disposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense played great holding them to 31 points,'' Chandler
said. ``For Stephenville, that's great. We just had to score more
points to beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   Another game, another lesson learned too late.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Kelan Luker's 52-yard game-winning scoring pass to
receiver Cody Cardwell with 1:04 remaining was the deciding blow
delivered against Carroll's defense.
</P>
<P>
   With its victory, two-time state champion Stephenville (14-1)
earned its third meeting with La Marque (13-0) in a title game this
decade. The teams will meet 4 p.m. Saturday in the 4A Division II
Texas Bowl at Texas Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it'd be a war all the way through,'' Stephenville
coach Art Briles said of his team's first-ever game against
Carroll. ``This is a great win for the community of Stephenville
and a tribute to our program.''
</P>
<P>
   With Chandler and running back Clay McNutt (160 yards, four
touchdowns rushing) stretching Stephenville's defense to a limit
rarely seen this year, the Yellow Jackets overcame nine lead
changes and a crucial loss of possession with 2:43 to play.
</P>
<P>
   After McNutt's fourth touchdown run gave Carroll a 28-24 lead,
Luker (338 yards, four touchdowns passing) was sacked twice on his
team's ensuing possession. After the second sack, Stephenville
elected to roll the dice and try for a first down on fourth-and-17
at its own 35.
</P>
<P>
   But Carroll stopped the Yellow Jackets and took possession at
the 26, drove to the Stephenville 19 and went for a first down on
fourth-and-3. Stephenville linebacker Keith McCormick stopped
McNutt after a 2-yard gain, fulfilling Stephenville's hope for a
last possession.
</P>
<P>
   A Carroll field goal would have pushed the Dragons' lead to
31-24. But an inexperienced kicking game caused Carroll coach Tom
Rapp to go Vegas-style himself.
</P>
<P>
   It was a gamble Carroll might regret.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going to kick a field goal, but we were too far \R36
yards\S,'' Rapp said. ``I've got two sophomore kickers and they
can't kick it that far.''
</P>
<P>
   Three plays later, Cardwell added to his already-growing lore.
</P>
<P>
   With 1:04 to play, Luker dropped back, waited and fired 52 yards
to Cardwell (12 catches, 287 yards, three touchdowns) for the
game-winning score.
</P>
<P>
   ``It couldn't have worked out any better,'' Briles said. ``You
play that out 10 times, it might work for you one or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throw it up, let him run under it, catch a touchdown. That's
about as simple as it gets. Cody's a different cat. We're just
thankful to have him.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll had one final drive of its own beginning with 58 seconds
to play, but it ended with four consecutive incompletions by
Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the fourth quarter, Stephenville's Clayton Harmon
sacked Chandler to end a Carroll drive _ a defensive stop that
proved crucial to the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Luker found Cardwell on the next Stephenville possession,
freeing himself from a defensive back for a 43-yard touchdown and
24-21 Yellow Jackets lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole game we had a chance to put it away but we didn't
execute,'' Chandler said. ``I threw too many bad passes, and that
hurt us.''

`SAVING PRIVATE RYAN' TOPS L.A. FILM CRITICS' LIST
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BOB STRAUSS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Saving Private Ryan'' won its first major
skirmish of the 1998 movie awards season, capturing best picture,
director and cinematography nods from the Los Angeles Film Critics
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Spielberg's graphically violent D-Day epic was the only
film to win three LAFCA awards. Other multiple winners Saturday
were the television satire ``Pleasantville'' and the prep school
comedy ``Rushmore,'' both of which won two.
</P>
<P>
   Best actor honors went to Ian McKellen for his portrayal of
``Frankenstein'' director James Whale in ``Gods and Monsters,''
which adds to the momentum begun last week when he received the
same prize from the film scholars' organization the National Board
of Review.
</P>
<P>
   There was a tie for LAFCA's best actress between former Brat
Pack princess Ally Sheedy, who played a self-destructive
photographer in ``High Art,'' and Fernanda Montenegro, the
67-year-old star of the Brazilian production ``Central Station''
(Montenegro also won the National Board Award).
</P>
<P>
   There was another tie in LAFCA's supporting actor category.
Billy Bob Thornton was cited for his work as a slow-witted
small-town guy in ``A Simple Plan,'' and Bill Murray was named for
his two roles as an unconventional tycoon in ``Rushmore'' and a
sleazy lawyer in ``Wild Things.''
</P>
<P>
   Best supporting actress went to Joan Allen for her portrayal of
the black-and-white sitcom mom who blossoms into color in
``Pleasantville.'' ``Pleasantville'' also won for Jeanine
Oppewall's production design, while ``Rushmore'' director and
co-writer Wes Anderson earned the organization's New Generation
Award for emerging talent.
</P>
<P>
   Along with cinematographer Janusz Kaminski for ``Saving Private
Ryan,'' other behind-the-scenes award winners were Warren Beatty
and Jeremy Pisker for the ``Bulworth'' screenplay and Elliot
Goldenthal for music score for ``The Butcher Boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Two animation awards were approved, for Disney and Pixar's
feature ``A Bug's Life'' and the Dutch short film
``T.R.A.N.S.I.T.'' The foreign language film winner was Denmark's
``The Celebration,'' and the documentary prize went to the prison
expose ``The Farm: Angola USA.'' The experimental/independent
award-winner was ``Shulie.''
</P>
<P>
   LAFCA's Career Achievement awards, which were voted at an
earlier meeting, go this year to ``Casablanca'' screenwriter Julius
Epstein and blacklisted writer-directer Abraham Polonsky (``Body
and Soul,'' ``Force of Evil''). Special citations were also
approved in honor of the Hollywood-based American Cinemateque's
director Barbara Zicka Smith and the team behind the restoration of
Orson Welles' classic ``Touch of Evil.''
</P>
<P>
   LAFCA is made up of critics who have reviewed films for Southern
California-based publications and radio stations. Forty-one members
attended the voting meeting in suburban Northridge on Saturday. The
awards will be presented at the Bel Age Hotel in West Hollywood on
Jan. 20.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's two other major critics groups, the New York Film
Critics Circle and the National Society of Film Critics, vote for
their awards on Wednesday and Jan. 3, respectively. The Golden
Globe Awards, which are generally considered the most accurate
predictor of how the motion picture Academy will vote, announce
their nominations Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Notable for their absence in LAFCA's winner and runner-up lists
are such heavily touted Oscar hopefuls as the Italian Holocaust
comedy ``Life Is Beautiful,'' Robin Williams' upcoming medical
heart-warmer ``Patch Adams,'' the John Travolta courtroom drama ``A
Civil Action'' and that other World War II film, Terrence Malick's
hotly anticipated ``The Thin Red Line.''
</P>
<P>
   LAFCA runners-up include ``The Butcher Boy'' for best picture,
Nick Nolte for best actor for ``Affliction,'' Kathy Bates for
supporting actress for ``Primary Colors'' and John Boorman for
director for ``The General.'' ``The General'' was also runner-up
for Cinematography. Other runners-up were ``Gods and Monsters'' for
music, ``The Truman Show'' for production design and ``Shakespeare
In Love'' for screenplay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Central Station'' was the foreign language runner-up. ``Public
Housing'' came in second for documentary.

COYOTES, KHA BIBULIN GET SWEET RE VENGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANATA, Ontario _ Games in the regular season aren't supposed to
mean a whole heck of a lot in the NHL, a league where it seems
every team makes the playoffs regardless of how good or bad it is.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday night meant something a little more special for the
Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I'm sure they're going to be gunning for us,'' Ottawa
Senators Coach Jacques Martin said before the game. ``We gave them
a pretty good roughing up in the first game of the year, and I've
got to believe they'd like to get us back if they can.''
</P>
<P>
   They did, but it took 60 minutes of non-stop grit and sweat _
and a world-class performance from goalie Nikolai Khabibulin _
before the Coyotes could impeach the Senators, 2-0, at the Corel
Centre.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, which avenged a brutal 4-1 season-opening loss at
home to Ottawa on Oct. 11, kept the surging Coyotes (17-3-3)
unbeaten in 18 of their past 19 games. They are 3-0-1 since having
their franchise-record 14-game unbeaten string snapped in Edmonton
on Dec. 2. They are tied with New Jersey (37 points) for the best
record in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, you want to get a little revenge,'' said captain
Keith Tkachuk, who battled the flu all day but toughed it out and
was in the lineup. ``We didn't play our best tonight, but that
night, we played absolutely terrible. They took it to us that first
time and embarrassed us in our own building.''
</P>
<P>
   Not this time, though.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Jyrki Lumme scored the deciding goal, a one-handed
fling at a loose puck dug away from Ottawa goalie Ron Tugnutt early
in the second period. It was the lone goal of the contest until
fellow defenseman Teppo Numminen salted the victory with an
empty-netter with 48 seconds left to play.
</P>
<P>
   Khabibulin, meanwhile, who pitched his third shutout to improve
to 11-3-1, easily was the star of the game. As clutch as Lumme's
third goal of the season was, just about every one of Khabibulin's
42 saves was a virtual must if the Coyotes were to exact a little
revenge on the Senators and start their four-game trip on a
positive note.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the man,'' Tkachuk said of Khabibulin. ``He's absolutely
``the'' man.''
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa (13-10-3) had the Russian bear of a netminder turning
cartwheels in front of the goal, diving, sliding, spinning and
scrambling. At least a half dozen times, it looked as if the
Senators were on the doorstep of lighting the lamp. But each time,
Khabibulin slammed the door in their face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without question, he was the difference in the game,''
Ottawa's Martin said. ``We couldn't put anything past him, it
seemed, no matter how many shots or chances we had.''
</P>
<P>
   As seconds ticked off the game clock, and the Senators did their
best to keep up their attack, the Bulin Wall seemed to grow only
stronger and more impenetrable. Even when Martin pulled Tugnutt
with 1:13 left in regulation in favor of an extra skater,
Khabibulin didn't flinch or fail.
</P>
<P>
   Neither did the players in front of him, who quickly cleared the
puck out of the Phoenix zone time and time again when it mattered
most. In the end, center Jeremy Roenick moved it up along the
boards to Tkachuk, who spotted Numminen alone at the point. He
reared back on a slap shot and the ensuing blast went in off an
Ottawa defenseman for the insurance goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt pretty good tonight,'' said Khabibulin, who hadn't
played since last Saturday in Calgary. ``I probably could have
played another period or so. But it wasn't just me. The guys did a
pretty good job in front of me, clearing the rebounds. It was
probably more of a team effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my confidence is pretty good right now. I know I can stop
the puck, and all I needed to do was work on consistency and the
mental aspects of things, and at the same time, work on my physical
shape so I don't get tired.''
</P>
<P>
   He was wide awake against the Senators. He had to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played a tremendous game,'' Coyotes Coach Jim Schoenfeld
said. ``It seemed to me it didn't matter how long the game was
going to go: Nik was kind of in a zone tonight, and nothing was
going to get past him.'' &QL;

JUNIOR YEARS GOOD TO SMITH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANATA, Ontario _ Coyotes General Manager  &UR; Bobby Smith returned
to his hometown with a hero's welcome, having his No. 15 jersey
retired Friday night by his junior team, the Ottawa 67's, before
their Ontario Hockey League game against the Belleville Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who was accompanied by his wife,  &UR; Beth, and children,
 &UR; Ryan,
 &UR; Megan and  &UR; Daniel, played three seasons here in the late 1970s,
scoring 158 goals and 385 points. In 1977-78, he set an OHL record
for points (192) and assists (123) in a season.
</P>
<P>
   During the ceremony, Smith likened the moment to May 24, 1986,
when he was with the Montreal Canadiens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was fortunate enough on that night to score the Stanley
Cup-winning goal,'' he told the crowd at the Civic Centre. ``But I
do not think any boy growing up in Canada or anywhere else has the
audacity to dream that one day he will play on his hometown team,
and one day that team will see fit to retire his jersey.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith saved his most personal gratitude for his former coach,
 &UR; Brian
 &UR; Kilrea, still coaching the 67's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a kid who played hockey when I got here as a
17-year-old,'' Smith said, ``and three years later, I was a hockey
player. That might seem like a semantical difference to some, but
Brian knows what I mean. I could barely compete in the OHL at one
point, and three years later, I was ready to go head to head with
any team in the NHL. Brian, you know it. Thank you very much.'' &QL; 
Home again II &QL; 
Smith wasn't the only person to enjoy a nice homecoming. Rookie
defenseman  &UR; Bryan Helmer, who was raised in the small town of
Winchester, about 30 miles south of Ottawa, had nearly half of his
hometown watch him play Saturday night against the Senators at the
Corel Centre.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe not half. But more than 200 friends and family members
from Winchester (population 3,500) were in attendance. Playing in
nearby Albany, N.Y., for the past five years, Helmer could always
find time to pay his family a visit around the Christmas holidays.
This year, he wasn't so sure.
</P>
<P>
   If defenseman  &UR; Gerald Diduck hadn't suffered a charley horse
last week, the general consensus was that Helmer probably would be
sent to Las Vegas of the International Hockey League for the fourth
time. Diduck played Saturday, leaving Coach  &UR; Jim Schoenfeld with a
tough decision. Which defenseman would be a healthy scratch?
</P>
<P>
   He chose  &UR; Deron Quint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of anything much more exciting than getting a
chance to play in an NHL game in front of all those people I know
for the first time,'' Helmer said. ``It's the kind of stuff you
dream about.'' &QL; 
Slap shots &QL; 
Center  &UR; Jeremy Roenick will play in his 700th career game Wednesday
night in Toronto in his and the Coyotes' final appearance at
storied Maple Leaf Gardens. The facility will close in the coming
weeks and make way for a new arena for the Leafs. &QL;

<P>
   NATCHITOCHES, La. _ Choo-choo! Next whistle-stop for the
Minuteman Express: Chattanooga, Tenn. All aboard!
</P>
<P>
   The University of Massachusetts football program, derailed last
season by the long, uphill struggle of a 2-9 campaign, continued
one of the nation's most stunning turnarounds Saturday, taking the
express route to the NCAA Division 1-AA championship game with a
41-31 semifinal victory over host Northwestern State before a
Turpin Stadium crowd of 10,424.
</P>
<P>
   The 11th-seeded Minutemen (11-3) earned a first-class berth in
next Saturday's title game in Chattanooga against top-seeded
Georgia Southern (14-0), which routed Western Illinois, 42-14, in
the day's other semifinal.
</P>
<P>
   It will be only the second UMass appearance in the Division 1-AA
championship game _ the other was a loss to Florida A&AMP;M in the
inaugural 1-AA playoffs in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to have a good shot next week, because I
don't think they thought this was the end all,'' said first-year
UMass coach Mark Whipple, who, from the moment he set foot on
campus in Amherst last June, established the national championship
as a team objective. ``We played well and we played hard and we
accomplished what we wanted to do this week, but there's still
something left. It wasn't like the euphoria that will be there next
week if we can get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   After trailing, 24-21, at the end of the third quarter, the
Minutemen generated the momentum they needed from their hardnosed
defense to steamroll Northwestern State (11-3) with a
fourth-quarter outburst of 20 unanswered points.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did a good job of mixing it up,'' said Northwestern State
quarterback Brad Spangler, who completed 10 of 24 attempts for 242
yards and a pair of TDs but was twice intercepted and was sacked
five times. ``They were showing different things and doing other
things. Credit their defense.''
</P>
<P>
   UMass, which got perfect symmetry from a balanced offense that
rolled up 237 rushing yards and 237 passing yards, went on its
fourth-quarter scoring spree with the help of a defense that made
three critical big plays: an interception by linebacker Khari
Samuel that led, one play later, to Todd Bankhead's 49-yard
touchdown pass to Matt Jordan; a fourth-and-9 stand that led to a
decisive eight-play, 64-yard march capped by Marcel Shipp's 24-yard
scoring run; and a freakish fumble recovery by defensive end Chris
Price, who pickpocketed running back Tony Taylor at the
Northwestern 12. That turnover, one of four by the Demons, set up a
1-yard plunge by Bankhead that gave UMass a 41-24 lead with 58
seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   After outscoring UMass in the second quarter, 21-7, to take a
21-14 halftime lead, Northwestern was limited to a 29-yard field
goal by Thomas LaToof with 3:44 left in the third before scoring on
a 45-yard desperation pass from Spangler to Nathan Black with eight
seconds remaining in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Khari's interception was the biggest play of the
game,'' said Whipple. ``I felt like we were letting it slip away
when we gave the ball back (after a failed fourth-and-6 from the
Demons 38). But that just gave us a big lift.''
</P>
<P>
   On the first play following the interception, Whipple called
``North 56 Reverse Pass,'' a pass play designed to go to fullback
Matt Jordan that the Minutemen had used to open the game. ``When I
sent in the play, Todd kind of looked at me from the huddle, like,
`What do you mean?''' Whipple said. ``And I was, like, `Just run
the damn play and throw it for a touchdown.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bankhead, who completed 17 of 30 attempts for 237 yards and two
touchdowns and rushed for two more scores on a pair of 1-yard
plunges, took the snap, faked a reverse handoff to Adrian Zullo,
put the ball on his hip as he looked downfield, then complied with
his coach's orders by hitting a wide-open Jordan for a 49-yard
touchdown that gave UMass a 27-24 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had run it on the first play of the game,'' Bankhead said.
``But I couldn't believe how wide open he was the second time
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as remarkable was the hardnosed rushing effort of Shipp,
who led the Minutemen by rushing 38 times for 190 yards, the most
gained this season by a Northwestern opponent. With the big day,
Shipp surpassed the 3,000-yard mark for his career.
</P>
<P>
   Shipp, who had been hampered by a nagging left knee injury, got
crisp blocking from his offensive line on an eight-play, 64-yard
march that he sustained by carrying six times for 53 yards,
including the 24-yard scoring burst that gave UMass a 34-24 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, Shipp had expressed concern that his game might
be missing a spark, ``But  &UR; today &LR;  I felt like I found it,'' he said
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Price provided a spark of his own by coming up with his amazing
take-away, which set up Bankhead's second 1-yard TD plunge,
perfectly punctuating this incredible postseason journey with an
exclamation point.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of the 14 games we've played this year, we've not had one bad
game,'' said Whipple. ``We've not had one bad week of practice.
These guys have been extremely consistent, and it's been a good
ride so far.''

COYOTES, KHABIBULIN GET SWEET REVENGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANATA, Ontario _ Games in the regular season aren't supposed to
mean a whole heck of a lot in the NHL, a league where it seems
every team makes the playoffs regardless of how good or bad it is.
</P>
<P>
   But Saturday night meant something a little more special for the
Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I'm sure they're going to be gunning for us,'' Ottawa
Senators Coach Jacques Martin said before the game. ``We gave them
a pretty good roughing up in the first game of the year, and I've
got to believe they'd like to get us back if they can.''
</P>
<P>
   They did, but it took 60 minutes of non-stop grit and sweat _
and a world-class performance from goalie Nikolai Khabibulin _
before the Coyotes could impeach the Senators, 2-0, at the Corel
Centre.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, which avenged a brutal 4-1 season-opening loss at
home to Ottawa on Oct. 11, kept the surging Coyotes (17-3-3)
unbeaten in 18 of their past 19 games. They are 3-0-1 since having
their franchise-record 14-game unbeaten string snapped in Edmonton
on Dec. 2. They are tied with New Jersey (37 points) for the best
record in the NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh yeah, you want to get a little revenge,'' said captain
Keith Tkachuk, who battled the flu all day but toughed it out and
was in the lineup. ``We didn't play our best tonight, but that
night, we played absolutely terrible. They took it to us that first
time and embarrassed us in our own building.''
</P>
<P>
   Not this time, though.
</P>
<P>
   Defenseman Jyrki Lumme scored the deciding goal, a one-handed
fling at a loose puck dug away from Ottawa goalie Ron Tugnutt early
in the second period. It was the lone goal of the contest until
fellow defenseman Teppo Numminen salted the victory with an
empty-netter with 48 seconds left to play.
</P>
<P>
   Khabibulin, meanwhile, who pitched his third shutout to improve
to 11-3-1, easily was the star of the game. As clutch as Lumme's
third goal of the season was, just about every one of Khabibulin's
42 saves was a virtual must if the Coyotes were to exact a little
revenge on the Senators and start their four-game trip on a
positive note.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the man,'' Tkachuk said of Khabibulin. ``He's absolutely
``the'' man.''
</P>
<P>
   Ottawa (13-10-3) had the Russian bear of a netminder turning
cartwheels in front of the goal, diving, sliding, spinning and
scrambling. At least a half dozen times, it looked as if the
Senators were on the doorstep of lighting the lamp. But each time,
Khabibulin slammed the door in their face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without question, he was the difference in the game,''
Ottawa's Martin said. ``We couldn't put anything past him, it
seemed, no matter how many shots or chances we had.''
</P>
<P>
   As seconds ticked off the game clock, and the Senators did their
best to keep up their attack, the Bulin Wall seemed to grow only
stronger and more impenetrable. Even when Martin pulled Tugnutt
with 1:13 left in regulation in favor of an extra skater,
Khabibulin didn't flinch or fail.
</P>
<P>
   Neither did the players in front of him, who quickly cleared the
puck out of the Phoenix zone time and time again when it mattered
most. In the end, center Jeremy Roenick moved it up along the
boards to Tkachuk, who spotted Numminen alone at the point. He
reared back on a slap shot and the ensuing blast went in off an
Ottawa defenseman for the insurance goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt pretty good tonight,'' said Khabibulin, who hadn't
played since last Saturday in Calgary. ``I probably could have
played another period or so. But it wasn't just me. The guys did a
pretty good job in front of me, clearing the rebounds. It was
probably more of a team effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``But my confidence is pretty good right now. I know I can stop
the puck, and all I needed to do was work on consistency and the
mental aspects of things, and at the same time, work on my physical
shape so I don't get tired.''
</P>
<P>
   He was wide awake against the Senators. He had to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played a tremendous game,'' Coyotes Coach Jim Schoenfeld
said. ``It seemed to me it didn't matter how long the game was
going to go: Nik was kind of in a zone tonight, and nothing was
going to get past him.'' &QL;

HASEK, SABRES STOP BRUINS' STREAK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Boston Globe

<P>
   BOSTON _ Sometimes it just isn't your day.
</P>
<P>
   Like when you arrive at your favorite coffee shop in the
morning, buy your cup of brew, but the lid isn't attached tightly
enough and you spill it all over the car floor. Add to that, they
were out of your favorite newspaper and the clerk gave you back 65
cents change in pennies that you dropped in the parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   When you pull out of the parking lot, you notice the traffic is
backed up 3 more miles than usual, the skies have just opened up,
it's raining harder than you've ever seen, and your wipers won't
work. Then you hit the accelerator instead of the brakes and you
rear-end another car 40 feet from your office garage.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, no matter what you do, it all goes wrong.
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of bad fortune the Bruins experienced against
the Buffalo Sabres Saturday night at the FleetCenter as they
dropped a 4-1 decision, ending their unbeaten streak at eight games
(6-0-2). It was the first loss for Boston in nearly a month, the
last Nov. 14 to Dallas, and just its second loss in 14 games
(8-2-4).
</P>
<P>
   ``We made things go their way,'' said coach Pat Burns. ``We did
it to ourselves. They didn't do it to us. I give them full credit.
We didn't deserve to be on the same ice surface as them the first
20 minutes. It's disappointing. We got away with it last game
against Carolina. It was the same first period we played against
Carolina. But we didn't get away with it tonight. They're not a
great team. They're a good team. They have a great goaltender, but
they're a good team because they don't seem to care who scores or
how it's scored and that's why they're having success. We've played
well in our last stretch of games and it would be unfair to the
players to say we're doomed for trouble, but we've won games in the
last couple that maybe we shouldn't have won.''
</P>
<P>
   The barrage started just 4:09 in when a bad giveaway by one of
the Bruins' most reliable players set the tone for disaster. Rob
DiMaio, among the team's most conservative and consistent forwards,
dished a blind backhanded pass from the right circle in the
defensive zone right to Buffalo center Brian Holzinger. Not pausing
to say ``Thank you,'' Holzinger marched down the slot and wristed a
shot past goalie Byron Dafoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't plan on giving a guy a breakaway right at the hash
marks,'' said a dejected DiMaio. ``There's no excuse for it. It's
stupid. It's a not-prepared-to-play play. I deserve the heat. I set
the tone for the game. I don't really know what to say. I was just
awful.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins' luck went from bad to worse as they surrendered a
pair of goals in the final minute of the first period, ballooning
the Sabres' lead to 3-0. With 50.1 seconds remaining, forward Dixon
Ward, along the right-wing boards, delivered a hard pass to center
Mike Peca in the slot. Peca was all alone and he made the Bruins
pay for it as he fired a shot past Dafoe from the right hash marks.
</P>
<P>
   Miroslav Satan scored his first of two goals with only five
seconds remaining, banging in a rebound of a wraparound by left
wing Michal Grosek. The Sabres had three goals on nine shots and
the Bruins' heads were spinning.
</P>
<P>
   Satan scored the fourth Buffalo goal on the power play at 13:07
of the second, a period in which the Bruins outshot the Sabres,
21-8, but had nothing to show for it. The Bruins peppered goalie
Dominik Hasek (36 saves) but couldn't get anything past him. Steve
Heinze had four shots in the middle period and defenseman Dave
Ellett three.
</P>
<P>
   Boston broke through the nearly impenetrable netminder at 7:50
of the third, ending Hasek's shutout streak at 146 minutes 5
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   P.J. Axelsson scored his third goal of the year and second in
the last two games when he fired the puck from the right boards in
front for Chris Taylor but it instead hit Zhitnik and deflected
past Hasek. DiMaio earned an assist, wiping out the possibility of
his early mistake holding up as the winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a perfect example where you had to show up,'' said
Burns. ``It was a perfect example where you look at the standings
and say we had a chance to move ahead in this whole thing. We have
a chance to beat a team that's comfortable and playing well and
confident and so are we. We missed our chance and that's what
disturbed me the most.''

DODGERS SIGN BROWN TO $105 MILLION CONTRACT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY MICHAEL A. ANASTASI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Now, anything less than a world championship is
failure.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers became baseball's first team to guarantee a player
$100 million Saturday when they signed Kevin Brown _ the game's
premier free-agent pitcher _ to a seven-year, $105 million
contract.
</P>
<P>
   The deal utterly stunned, though not necessarily surprised,
baseball administrators gathered in Nashville, Tenn., this week for
their annual winter meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, the American sports jewel of Rupert Murdoch's
empire, raised their payroll to about $80 million annually, 10
times what the Montreal Expos paid their team this past season. The
$105 million also represents 30 percent of what Murdoch paid to buy
the Dodgers from Peter O'Malley.
</P>
<P>
   And like Shaquille O'Neal and even Wayne Gretzky before him,
Brown's arrival in Los Angeles brings the expectation of
professional sport played at its most elite level.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately, incoming Dodgers manager Davey Johnson named Brown
his Opening Day starter. ``I would have to say,'' Johnson said,
``we're the favorites to win the division.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who turns 34 during spring training, should face Randy
Johnson, himself just signed to a $52.4 million contract by the
Arizona Diamondbacks, on April 5 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Brown _ whose contract includes a no-trade clause and perks such
as a personal hotel suite for road trips and the use of a corporate
jet 12 times a year so that his wife and two sons may visit from
their Atlanta-area home _ is to be introduced at Dodger Stadium on
Tuesday. He issued only a statement Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am looking forward to being part of the re-establishment of
a winning tradition,'' he said. ``(The Dodgers ownership) made it
clear that they plan on being competitive year in and year out.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, 139-99 lifetime, has just one 20-win season in his 12
years in the major leagues, has never won a Cy Young Award, and
will be 40 years old when his contract expires in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Only five pitchers in the game's history, including Cy Young who
had 20, have won at least 15 games at that age. The legendary Bob
Gibson, 22-9 with a 1.12 earned-run average when he was 33 like
Brown, was 3-10 by the time he was 40.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Brown, who possesses a 94 mph sinking fastball, is 51-26 the
last three seasons and led both the Florida Marlins and San Diego
Padres to the World Series the last two. And only he and Atlanta's
Greg Maddux have thrown more than 1,400 innings over the last seven
years.
</P>
<P>
   His ultimate value, though, transcends dominant numbers.
</P>
<P>
   The four-time All-Star is known as a fierce competitor who plays
his best when the stakes are at their highest. Against the Atlanta
Braves, the National League's juggernaut of the 1990s, Brown is 6-0
with a 1.85 ERA in his last eight starts and, moreover, is 3-0 in
NL Championship Series games he's started against that team.
</P>
<P>
   Like Kirk Gibson _ who justified his free-agent signing by the
Dodgers to a then-rich, three-year contract as a 31-year-old with a
single at-bat in the 1988 World Series _ Brown raises the level of
play of those around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``(He) has a huge winning impact on all his teammates,
especially the other pitchers on the staff,'' Dodgers general
manager and executive vice president Kevin Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The signing of Brown brings us a quality No. 1 starter with
power, durability, leadership, and most importantly, the desire and
passion to win.''
</P>
<P>
   With a front three of Brown, Chan Ho Park and Darren Dreifort,
the Dodgers' pitching rotation is impressive.
</P>
<P>
   Among the five teams pursuing Brown were the Disney-owned
Angels, who on Nov. 25 signed Mo Vaughn to what then set baseball's
high for average annual salary, $13.33 million under a six-year,
$80 million agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Brown averages $15 million annually. His total salary eclipses
the previous high of $91 million, set by Mike Piazza and the New
York Mets on Oct. 23. Ironically, it was Piazza's demand for a $100
million deal from the Dodgers that led to his trade this past
summer.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers do not instantly become baseball's best team. They
ranked nearly last in the league in runs scored this season and
only have taken modest steps to improve in that area, most
significantly with the Dec. 1 acquisition of catcher Todd Hundley
in a trade with the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers outfield is outstanding, but they have an unproven
third baseman in Adrian Beltre and a poor defensive shortstop with
Mark Grudzielanek. Other offseason acquisitions have brought
journeymen.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Malone is confident Brown's signing is the key to
pushing the Dodgers from the solid, yet generally underperforming
level of recent seasons to that of genuinely contending for a
championship.
</P>
<P>
   So much so, in fact, that Malone was willing to face his
colleagues' universal condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an affront to baseball,'' said Sandy Alderson, an
executive vice president in the commissioner's office, reflecting
similar comments made by many of the sport's leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Said Malone: ``If we didn't do it, and that doesn't justify it,
but somebody else was going to do it.''

HASEK TRUE TO `DOMINATOR' TAG 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Bruins tried nearly everything against Dom-inik
Hasek Saturday night. According to coach Pat Burns, some Bruins
went the fancy route, Sergei Samsonov was actually ``dancing,''
while others tried to be ``bang bang picture perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Only P.J. Axelsson solved the riddle of Hasek. He simply whacked
a shot off a Buffalo player and under Hasek's legs in the final
period of a 4-1 defeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't shoot, you're not going to score,'' Axelsson
said. ``You have to get some traffic in front of him and tip the
puck or get a rebound. You just have to get it on net because he's
an awesome goalie.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns approved of the Bruins' ``basic hockey'' of the final two
periods. But even that might not have been enough to overcome
Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't do it in the first period,'' Don Sweeney said. ``And
they capitalized on our mistakes. For the last two days, the
coaches have been telling us what to expect but we failed to go out
and do what we needed to do. We are disappointed in ourselves and
we'd better be motivated from this because we have a tough streak
coming up and we have to get back to the things that caused us to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins performed poorly in the first period, losing
concentration and surrendering possession easily. They had several
scoring chances in the second period but again were victims of
Hasek's gymnastics and whatever other tricks he has up his sleeve
or hidden in his pads.
</P>
<P>
   This was another Hasek highlight show. He ended up in all sorts
of strange positions while frustrating the Bruins. The most unusual
was a stop of Samsonov while in a sit-up position just outside the
crease late in the second period. After making the save, Hasek
appeared to improvise a half sit-up just to show he could do it
while keeping some sort of invisible barrier in front of the
Buffalo net.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone talks about how great Dominik Hasek is,'' Bruins
goalie Byron Dafoe said. ``I looked forward to the match against
the best in the world, and we matched up pretty well. But it's
tough to go down 1-0 right off the bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was his usual self. In the second period we threw
everything at him, and he did what he's done his whole career. He
has an advantage right off the bat, and he's earned it. When you
are playing Buffalo, guys automatically think about Dominik Hasek
and he can be intimidating because of what he can do. I've seen
highlights where he goes down and guys miss the net, but you just
have to realize he is human.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasek might well be a generic member of the species, but he is
proving that all goaltenders are not created equal.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the contest, the Bruins had textbook attacks. They
waited for Hasek to go to the ice, then attempted to lift the shot
over him. They screened him, sent shots in, waited for rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   But when the time came to convert, shots would go straight to
Hasek's glove like a magnet. When the Bruins awaited rebounds, the
puck stayed on Hasek like Velcro. Sometimes, Hasek seemed to just
wave his stick at shots and they would glide past the post.
</P>
<P>
   Axelsson proved that the unexpected move is the best way to go,
though it is doubtful the Bruins could have quadruplicated his shot
off a Sabre's skate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to come out and do better than that in the first
period,'' Axelsson said. ``We know we have to work for goals. And
you can't let Buffalo score three goals because it's tough to get
back. We'll have to be more ready for the next game.''

BENTLEY ONLY DOES HALF JOB, FAILS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WALTHAM, Mass. _ Bentley College used man-to-man defense
Saturday night against North Dakota State even though coach Barbara
Stevens considered going to a zone. No matter what alignment
Bentley chose, it might not have made much difference, as nearly
everything North Dakota State fired up went in.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 3-ranked Bison connected on 60 percent of their shots
(33 of 55) even though they made only two of their first seven
field goal attempts. North Dakota State's field goal percentage was
the best ever against Bentley as the Bison took a 98-70 win.
</P>
<P>
   The game was tied at 43 at halftime, then Bison outscored
Bentley, 55-27, in the second half before 1,800 at the Dana Center.
Bentley is no slouch, either, ranked No. 4 in the country at 9-2
entering the game.
</P>
<P>
   North Dakota State (9-0) made 31 of its last 48 shots, a 64.6
percent clip. And the Bison cashed in on 11 of 15 3-point tries
(73.3 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Lauren Fuller had 16 points for Bentley, which shot 41.8 percent
(23 of 55), with Jen Pemberton adding 15. Jayne Even had 20 for
North Dakota State and Amanda Gehrke 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stonehill played a matchup zone against North Dakota State and
held them to 36 percent on 3-pointers,'' Stevens said. ``Maybe we
were stubborn in not going to a zone, but I felt that would have
sealed our fate. We were more aggressive early, but then, when we
missed a couple of shots, they started to shoot well, and that put
the damper on us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very disappointed with our defensive effort. We lost our
enthusiasm. You have to make sure to be able to weather some
storms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a little up-and-down now. In the past we were able to
handle these types of things, but then our team was looking around,
wondering where the next bullets would come from, and North Dakota
State was standing behind the 3-point line.''
</P>
<P>
   Bentley was ahead, 15-5, with 14:11 left in the first half, on a
fast-break layup by Pemberton. The Falcons had their largest lead,
14 points (19-5, with 12:45 left), when Pemberton made a layup.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was our hope that we would do that, get out to a quick
lead,'' said Stevens. ``We did it with a lot of transition baskets
and by getting the ball inside to Fuller.''
</P>
<P>
   Then North Dakota State got it to 9 points, 30-21, on a basket
by Brenna Stefonowicz, with 8:14 left. It was at 4, 41-37, with
2:35 left on a Theresa Lang 3-pointer. It was all even at 41 when
North Dakota State's Kiauna Burns canned a jumper from the foul
line with 1:10 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bentley was more aggressive and it had a nonstop defense, and
then late in the second half we were more aggressive with the ball,
always looking to drive,'' said North Dakota State coach Amy Ruley,
who has had five national champions (1991, '93, '94, '95, and '96).
</P>
<P>
   North Dakota State went up by 10, 56-46, when Jayne Boeddeker
hit from the paint. It was 69-54 when Anna Bogstad scored with 8:15
remaining. And it was 75-55 with 6:43 remaining when Burns canned
two free throws.

KINGS SHUT OUT CANUCKS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Break out the smelling salts.
</P>
<P>
   The chronically struggling Kings suddenly are rolling, at least
by the humble standards they set through the season's first two
months.
</P>
<P>
   With goals from Luc Robitaille (as usual), Craig Johnson (a
rarity) and Yanic Perreault (a late empty-netter), strong
goaltending from Stephane Fiset, and a gutty five-minute stretch of
penalty killing in the third period, the Kings defeated the
Vancouver Canucks 3-0 Saturday night before a crowd of 13,844 at
the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   The victory was the second in a row for the Kings (8-17-3), the
first time they've accomplished that modest feat this season.
They'll go for three straight at 5:05 p.m. today when they face the
Mighty Ducks at the Pond.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings regained the services of defenseman Rob Blake, who had
missed 15 games with a broken foot, a nightmarish stretch during
which the team posted a 3-12 record. But in the third period, with
Doug Bodger serving a holding penalty, Blake picked up a major
slashing penalty and a game misconduct for hacking at the right
elbow of Vancouver's Harry York, who left the game because of an
injury on the play.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Kings were forced to play two men short for 90
seconds, then one man short for another 3:30. Somehow, they
survived, thanks in part to the Canucks' hesitancy to shoot, but
also because of key blocked shots by Sean O'Donnell and Mattias
Norstrom, and because of Fiset's quick glove, which he used to
cover a loose puck in the crease after Vancouver's Bill Muckalt
fanned on a shot at a wide-open net.
</P>
<P>
   Until being booted from the game, Blake played regularly at even
strength and on special teams. With Blake back, it was the first
game this season in which he and No. 1 center Jozef Stumpel both
played and were healthy.
</P>
<P>
   The Canucks (10-14-4), on the other hand, were missing key
wingers Alexander Mogilny (sprained knee) and Todd Bertuzzi
(fractured leg).
</P>
<P>
   Despite an 18-3 advantage in shots in the first period, the
Kings built only a 1-0 lead after 20 minutes. Robitaille was the
goal scorer, recording his team-high 14th goal this season three
minutes into the game. Robitaille scored just 16 goals last season.
</P>
<P>
   The 492nd goal of Robitaille's career came after he received a
pass behind the Canucks' net from Ray Ferraro and came out from
behind the net for a wraparound. The shot was stopped by goalie
Garth Snow, but Robitaille pounced on the rebound and lifted it
into the net.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings had numerous chances to pad the lead _ including four
consecutive minutes on the power play midway through the period _
but were unable to do so. An apparent power-play goal by Steve
Duchesne was waved off at 13:58 by referee Don Koharski because
Vladimir Tsyplakov's skate was in the crease.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings easily could have lost another goal late in the second
period, when Robitaille's pass to Johnson deflected off his left
skate, between Snow's pads and into the net. But Johnson's third
goal _ a rare power-play goal for the Kings _ was allowed to stand
because Koharski ruled Johnson had not intentionally directed the
puck into the net with the ``distinct kicking motion'' the NHL rule
book does not allow.
</P>
<P>
   The Canucks, outshot by a 34-11 margin in the first two periods,
had their best chance to tie the score in the second period when a
series of penalties left the Kings two men short for 59 seconds.
Two key faceoff wins by Stumpel, a blocked shot by Bodger and a
save by Fiset of a point-blank chance by Muckalt kept the Canucks
off the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   It proved to be good practice for the extended third-period
shorthanded situation, as inspiring a stretch of hockey as the
Kings have played all season.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Kings survived Blake's penalties, Fiset was not
severely tested again, and finished with 25 saves in his 13th
career shutout and the third this season by the Kings.

ROBINSON SURVIVES ACTION-FILLER SEQUEL
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY _ A fight was scheduled Saturday night at the Mark
Etess Center and nuclear warfare broke out.
</P>
<P>
   For 10 rounds, lightweights Arturo Gatti and Ivan Robinson took
harsh measure of each other. Round after round, the Philly fighter,
Robinson, strafed the Jersey guy, Gatti, ripping open the left side
of his face but often paying a heavy price as Gatti doubled him
over with two-sided body attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Few men in boxing could have taken the punishment Gatti
absorbed. Fewer still would have stood up to the pounding to the
liver and ribs Robinson swallowed.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Gatti's face would suffer the more obvious damage,
but he would lose not from the blood on his face but from the
ferocity of his body attack, an attack that eventually compelled
referee Benji Estevez to deduct a point in the eighth round after
two warnings for low blows.
</P>
<P>
   That point would be the difference as Robinson won a unanimous
decision with judges Joe Pasquale and George Colon scoring the
bout, 95-94, while Jean Williams somehow had it a lopsided 97-92.
The Globe card had Gatti a 95-94 winner. Had the point deduction
not been made, the fight would have been a draw, which might well
have been the most fitting end to a rematch that did what few
thought possible _ produced more fireworks than the first meeting
Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't take nothing away from Arturo,'' Robinson (27-2)
said. ``He's a tough guy. He was a lot better than the first fight.
He was moving his head a lot. I couldn't hit him as much.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not, but he hit him plenty and a man can take only so
much. In the two fights, Gatti was struck in the face 840 times. No
one's head was made to take such abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Barely 90 seconds into the first round it was obvious Gatti's
talk of boxing more and avoiding hand-to-hand combat had been
forgotten in a hail of Robinson punches that left Gatti's left
cheek swelling and his battle plan in tatters.
</P>
<P>
   Quickly reverting to the toe-to-toe warrior he has always been,
Gatti began winging punches and Robinson answered again and again
as the crowd roared. Nothing changed early on but the shape of
Gatti's face and by the final seconds of the third round his left
eye was cut, blood was smeared across his face, and Robinson was
bombing him with both hands.
</P>
<P>
   Gatti was now a young man turning old in the middle of the ring
and Robinson's constant jab and following combinations were
accelerating the aging process. But by the fifth round, Gatti went
after Robinson's body and got it, paying the price of having his
left cheek and eye opened up like an overripe plum as a cost of
doing that dreaded business.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gatti continued to land to the body while Robinson
returned fire to the head and in the seventh round they exchanged
furious barrages. Gatti nailed Robinson with more than half (41) of
his 75 punches but still was outhit 2-1 (77 of 117).
</P>
<P>
   After two warnings for low blows, Gatti finally had the fatal
point deducted in the eighth but battled on, ripping at Robinson's
body and trying to find his chin until the bell sounded to begin
the final round. When it did, the two warriors walked to the center
of the ring and looked at each other for several seconds before
each leaned forward and touched foreheads.
</P>
<P>
   The real issue had been decided right there. Each had won what
they had come for, the other's respect.

UPSCALE CINEMAS POPPING UP LIKE CORN IN L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The war for the wallets of moviegoers in L.A.'s
San Fernando Valley goes ballistic this week.
</P>
<P>
   Two lavishly furnished and elaborately named new complexes _ the
six-screen Edwards Grand Palace Stadium Cinemas in Calabasas and
the Northridge Fashion Center All Stadium 10 _ will open Friday and
add more than 4,000 seats to the region's inventory.
</P>
<P>
   Both possess all the bells and whistles of new theaters with
colorful entrances, high-back ``love seats,'' steep aisles for
clear sightlines, wall-to-wall screens, massive snack bars and
digital sound. ``State-of-the-art everything'' brags the
promotional material for the Edwards facility.
</P>
<P>
   More impressively, both have been designed as key attractions
within upscale retail centers as developers nationwide scramble to
offer shopping and entertainment in the same location. The frenzy
to open shiny new facilities reached the Santa Clarita Valley,
where Edwards opened the Edwards Canyon Country Stadium 10 on Nov.
13.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, four more state-of-the-art complexes are coming to
the region in Valencia, Sherman Oaks, Burbank and Glendale. That's
an impressive turnaround from just a few years ago, when developers
shunned movie theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``When malls were the hottest development going, they used to
shy away from incorporating theaters because they were perceived as
attracting juvenile delinquents at night and required a great deal
of parking,'' said Gordon Hodge, an analyst with Nationsbanc
Montgomery Securities. ``Now, it's become clear that anything that
brings in significant amounts of traffic is really appreciated, so
you're seeing retail developments with the theaters as the
anchor.''
</P>
<P>
   Up until a few years ago, many analysts believed the movie
exhibition business was headed the way of eight-track tapes. But
the business began reinventing itself in 1995 when AMC
Entertainment opened the nation's first ``megaplex,'' the 24-screen
Grand in Dallas, followed by eight more megaplexes in the next
year, including the Promenade 16 in Woodland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was simple _ offer moviegoers more bang for the buck by
giving them the option of multiple start times, enough concession
space to avoid long waits in line and put them in locations where
customers will have something to do before and after the film
rather than having to spend the evening in the car.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of blending moviegoing, shopping and eating in a single
location has now become a staple of retail development.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inclusion of movie theaters in any new development helps
ensure that project's success due to the additional generation of
customers,'' said Bill Boyd, senior vice president at commercial
broker Grubb &AMP; Ellis and a veteran in Valley real estate. ``Having
theaters extends the hours of a retail environment because they
keep more people at the location longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Affiliating with a retail development is as beneficial for the
retailers and restaurants as it is for operator of the movie
theaters _ they both enhance each other's success.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts estimated AMC's cash return on its investment topped
40percent during the first year of operation of megaplexes, an
impressive figure that enabled the chain to open even more
megaplexes.
</P>
<P>
   From AMC's success, analysts began to notice four key trends:
</P>
<P>
   _ Customers became more likely to show up outside new theaters
and then decide what movie to see.
</P>
<P>
   _ Customers began driving past older theaters to go to the new
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   _ Snack-bar sales, the key profit component in the exhibition
business, were significantly higher at the new facilities.
</P>
<P>
   _ Older theaters began to resort to discounting just to keep
customers coming.
</P>
<P>
   Rivals like Edwards, Regal, Cineplex Odeon and Pacific began
shifting their strategy to opening new facilities in locations that
were ``underserved'' and started to replace older theaters.
</P>
<P>
   The Promenade 16 in Woodland Hills had been such a success that
Pacific opened one of the largest theaters in the country _ the
6,000-seat Winnetka 20 _ less than five miles away on a former
drive-in site. Ten months later, Pacific is opening a theater at
Northridge that's about a mile from the Winnetka 20.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler Wood, executive vice president and head film buyer for
Pacific, insists the move makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest with you, the 6,000 seats at Winnetka are not
enough,'' Wood said. ``It's consistently in the top 10 grossers in
the country and has exceeded our expectations by a lot more than
anticipated. We're currently averaging 20 to 25 sellouts during the
weekend so we're turning people away.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Northridge theater, which will feature a three-story
lobby, half a dozen palm trees out front and a snack bar counter
more than 100 feet long, is part of a revamp of the mall's
northwest corner that will add 175,000 leasable square feet on
three levels by this summer. A Borders book store and Claim Jumper
restaurant already have opened; Ben &AMP; Jerry's and Juice Heaven have
agreed to open stores as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The theater was part of the entire package to develop an
open-air atmosphere with entertainment, restaurants and retail,''
said Carol Jacobs, general manager of the Northridge Fashion
Center. ``We will definitely not have a problem finding tenants.''
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   As for the Edwards Grand Palace in Calabasas, it will open in
the geographic slot between four Woodland Hills theaters with 35
screens on the east and a pair of 2-year-old Mann eight-plexes in
Westlake Village and Agoura Hills to the west.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demographics in the area are very good,'' said Mark
Stoner, director of real estate for the Edwards chain. ``People
have good incomes and there are a lot of families. We like the
whole area and felt it was under-screened.''
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Palace will sit amid pricey stores like Gary's Island
and Cold Stone Creamery and will be nearly the final tenant to open
at The Commons shopping center, where most facilities debuted last
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a beautiful upscale project that has the feel of a
French country villa,'' Stoner said. ``The city and the developer
limited us to six screens with 1,300 seats. If they had allowed us
to do a bigger theater, we probably would have.''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty more new theaters are coming, led by Pacific's 18-screen
replacement of its five-screen complex at the legendary Sherman
Oaks Galleria. Pacific will shut the site in February and install
4,000 stadium seats in its revamp.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards will open a 12-screen facility next spring in Valencia
with the added attraction of an adjacent Imax giant-screen.
Analysts say developers are increasingly considering the inclusion
of an Imax at movie complexes as a way of differentiating
themselves from rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Other new theaters in the region include a seven-screen Laemmle
in Pasadena, which will show art-house movies when it opens early
next year; an Imax at Universal Studios as part of an extensive
remodeling of its 18-screen Cineplex Odeon; a nine- to 12-screen
complex at a proposed Town Center development in Glendale; and the
addition of retail centers and a dozen new screens each to the
venerable Mann Chinese and Pacific Cinerama Dome sites in
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Hodge said the new-theater boom, which has been boosting the
nation's screen count by 7percent annually, should continue for the
foreseeable future. And he does not anticipate the market becoming
glutted with new theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call it the retreading of the circuits,'' he said. ``They're
shutting down antiquated facilities as leases expire and replacing
them. There are still plenty of new 20-screen megaplexes that make
good investment sense.''

RED SOX MAKE PLAY FOR PADRES' HAMILTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ Red Sox general manager Dan Duquette swung into
action almost immediately after arriving at baseball's winter
meetings late Saturday afternoon, offering a three-player package
for San Diego pitcher Joey Hamilton, according to an American
League executive.
</P>
<P>
   But indications Saturday night were that Hamilton is more likely
bound for AL East rival Toronto, which is looking to replace the
soon-to-be-departed Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette proposed sending pitcher John Wasdin, center fielder
Michael Coleman, and minor league lefthander Robert Ramsay to the
Padres, reeling Saturday from the loss of ace Kevin Brown to the
Los Angeles Dodgers. But the Blue Jays, according to the same
source, were offering pitcher Woody Williams, 25-year-old rookie
pitcher Carlos Almanzar, and another minor leaguer.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, 28, has won 40 games in the last three seasons for the
Padres, who may be in a rebuilding mode after losing free agents
Brown, Ken Caminiti, and Steve Finley.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton was awarded $3.25 million in salary arbitration last
season and can expect to climb to the $5 million range next season.
</P>
<P>
   Having lost Mo Vaughn and failing to sign Bernie Williams, money
is no object for the Red Sox, and Duquette has said he would prefer
to trade prospects rather than players on his big-league roster.
Duquette acknowledged Saturday that he talked to the Padres, but
did not go into detail.
</P>
<P>
   There was some thought that the Sox would inquire again about
San Diego outfielder Greg Vaughn, who hit 50 home runs last season,
but as of Saturday night that had not occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn is in the final year of a three-year, $14.865 million
deal under which he is due to be paid $5.75 million in 1999. Vaughn
is 33 and the Padres have Ruben Rivera waiting in the wings to
replace him.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, who hits righthanded, would give the Red Sox a
legitimate cleanup hitter with Nomar Garciaparra a logical
candidate to assume Mo Vaughn's No. 3 spot in the order. The Red
Sox would still be short a lefthanded hitter, but that could be
addressed by the addition of a first baseman _ switch-hitting free
agent Greg Jefferies, perhaps, or Ryan Klesko of the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   Klesko is also being pursued by the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
Duquette said he has not yet talked to the Braves, but Atlanta is
willing to move the 28-year-old slugger, who is an adequate first
baseman.
</P>
<P>
   There were indications Saturday night that free agent pitcher
Tim Belcher could sign as early as Sunday. Belcher was on the verge
of signing a three-year, $16.5 million deal, and Duquette did not
rule the Red Sox out of the running. ``We've had an interest
there,'' he said. The Angels, who lost out in the Brown derby, are
a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   Agent Scott Boras, who engineered the Brown signing, said the
Red Sox were still in the Belcher mix and that he intended to again
speak with Duquette. He confirmed that he has a three-year offer
for Belcher, but would not identify from whom, saying only there
were three or four teams in contention.
</P>
<P>
   According to officials with other clubs, the Sox have an
interest in 33-year-old Charlie Hayes, a third baseman by trade who
played 45 games at first base for the Giants last season. The
Giants picked up a $1.7 million option on Hayes, who filled in
nicely at first when J.T. Snow was hurt and also was used in a
platoon situation, but with Bill Mueller also available to play
third, Hayes could be expendable.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette said he did not meet Saturday with the Seattle
Mariners, but there were rumors that in addition to first baseman
David Segui, the Sox could have interest in Russ Davis, who made 32
errors at third base last season before being moved to left field.
Davis, 29, has hit 20 home runs in each of the last two seasons for
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll get some things done here,'' Duquette said. ``I don't
know how significant they'll be, but we'll get a few things done.''

DODGERS BREAK BANK TO LAND BROWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ It took one year to the day he signed with the Red
Sox for Pedro Martinez to look like a bargain, and just 2 1/2 weeks
for Mo Vaughn to lose his distinction as baseball's highest-paid
player.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, the Los Angeles Dodgers broke the $100 million salary
level by signing pitcher Kevin Brown to a seven-year, $105 million
deal in which Brown, who has won 20 games in a season only once,
has never won a game in the World Series, and has never won a Cy
Young Award, will collect $15 million a year until he turns 41. He
received a $5 million signing bonus, a $10 million salary next
season, and $15 million a year for the last six years of the
contract.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also agreed to provide Brown a private plane to fly
his family to Los Angeles from his home in Macon, Ga., 12 times a
year. Brown did not attend Saturday's press conference here, but
agent Scott Boras, the same man who had the Red Sox thinking Bernie
Williams was coming to Boston until the Yankees trumped their
offer, was present. And Boras uttered perhaps the day's most
prophetic words when he predicted that the ceiling set by Brown
won't last long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next year or the year after, it's the normal progression of
the industry,'' Boras said. ``Clubs will look at (Brown's contract)
as a barometer.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone made no apologies for
setting the new standard. ``If we didn't do it, and that doesn't
justify it, but somebody else was going to do it,'' said Malone,
who said two clubs _ believed to be the Orioles and Rockies _ were
prepared to pay Brown even more. ``He's been to the World Series in
each of the last two years. The Dodgers haven't been to the World
Series since 1988. That's why we've made the seven-year commitment
we did.''
</P>
<P>
   Only nine pitchers in major league history have won 15 or more
games at age 40. That number drops to five at age 41, which means
Brown, who went to the World Series with the Florida Marlins in
1997 and the San Diego Padres in 1998, will be paid $1 million a
win if he can join that group when he turns 40 in 2005.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who last year signed a then-record six-year, $75
million deal, will not reach the $15 million plateau until 2003,
the last year of his deal with the Sox. He will turn 32 at the end
of that season, and has a chance to be paid $17.5 million if the
club picks up his option in 2004. By then, Martinez may be no more
than a middle-of-the-road wage earner in the exploding economics of
Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you cross the $100 million barrier, you have what makes
us tantamount to the NBA,'' said Sandy Alderson, executive vice
president of baseball operations for Major League Baseball,
``especially when you start extending that level of money to a
player who is going to be in his late 30s or early 40s.
</P>
<P>
   ``One hundred million (dollar) contracts are why the NBA is
locked out today. This is not a good baseball decision. This was
not a decision made by a baseball person.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone, whose first GM job was with the threadbare Montreal
Expos, said he was sensitive to how Brown's contract, which
eclipses the average annual value of $13.33 million in Vaughn's
contract with the Angels as baseball's richest deal, will further
exacerbate the disparity between the haves and have-nots in the
game. But he said it's unfair to cast stones at the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a society that has a lower class, a middle class,
and an upper class,'' Malone said. ``We try to help those who are
less fortunate, but to criticize us because we're the Dodgers, we
have the stadium we have, we draw 3-4 million fans a year ... I
feel very blessed that we have the revenues that we can make this
kind of commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are owned by Rupert Murdoch's Fox media
conglomerate, which is fulfilling predictions that it would quickly
become among the game's biggest spenders. Brown's signing raises
the Dodgers' payroll to around $80 million for next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``This kind of event was not unforeseen,'' Alderson said of
Fox's record-setting deal.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes according to an outrageously expensive blueprint,
Randy Johnson of the Arizona Diamondbacks will face Brown on
Opening Day in Dodger Stadium next April, a matchup of pitchers
whose combined 1999 earnings ($28 million) will be higher than the
total payrolls of eight teams last season: Tampa Bay, Detroit,
Minnesota, Cincinnati, Florida, Oakland, Pittsburgh, and Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the enormous difference in payrolls between the elite
teams and their lesser brethren, Alderson said that realistically
only 12 to 15 teams have a chance to advance to the playoffs next
season. That means at least half of the teams will begin play
knowing they can't compete.
</P>
<P>
   The Martinez contract, of course, shows the Red Sox have not
been innocents in this salary escalation, or in pitchers getting
seven-year deals. Sox GM Dan Duquette, who arrived here Saturday
afternoon, has said he had interest in Brown but was unwilling to
give him a six-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers justified giving him seven years by noting he and
Greg Maddux of the Braves are the only pitchers to have thrown
1,400 innings in the last seven years.
</P>
<P>
   Davey Johnson, the new Dodgers manager, was asked if he
considered Brown the best pitcher in baseball. ``I certainly do,''
he said. ``He's my Opening Day pitcher. I don't usually announce it
this early. Yes, I'd have to say we're favorites to win the
division.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone is known to be interested in moving outfielder Gary
Sheffield, who has a $10 million-a-year contract, and the Sox are
known to like Dodgers outfielder Raul Mondesi. But Malone said
Saturday he has had no discussions with Boston.

 &HT;    Clinton, Congress react to Lawton Chiles death
 &HT;    By Larry Lipman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ News of Gov. Lawton Chiles' death brought the House
Judiciary Committee's impeachment proceedings to a halt Saturday
afternoon and momentarily united its bitterly divided members,
including three from Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Chiles' death was announced to the committee by Rep. Robert
Wexler, a Democrat from Boca Raton, Fla., who called Chiles ``the
epitome of a fine and decent man, a throwback to the age when
partisanship didn't play the role it plays (now) ... this man rose
above party.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida's two Republican members on the committee, Bill McCollum
of Longwood and Charles Canaday of Lakeland, joined in praising
Chiles before the committee observed a minute of silence in his
memory.
</P>
<P>
   McCollum recalled spending a day with Chiles in Central Florida
last year in the aftermath of killer tornadoes that ripped through
the area and ``the great compassion he showed.''
</P>
<P>
   Canaday, whose father was Chiles' campaign manager during his
first Senate campaign in 1970, called him ``a good man. He was a
dedicated public servant. I didn't agree with him politically in
recent years, but I had the utmost respect for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Official Washington quickly reacted with words of praise for
Chiles, who spent 18 years as a senator.
</P>
<P>
   The White House issued a statement from President Clinton, on
the first day of his trip to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lawton Chiles was a close friend of mine for many years,''
said Clinton, who twice invited Chiles to stay overnight at the
White House and watched two Superbowl games together. Earlier this
year, only days after the Monica Lewinsky scandal surfaced, Chiles
was Hillary Rodham Clinton's guest during this year's State of the
Union address.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called Chiles an ``indefatigable champion of Florida's
children and familes and a steadfast protector of the environment.
He displayed courage time and time again, most recently challenging
the nation's top cigarette makers and emerging victorious.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno, a Floridian, said Chiles ``put
principle above partisanship and reason above rancor. He fought for
the uninsured, for infants, for the elderly and for minorities. His
legacy is long and his impact great. He was a great senator, great
governor, great Floridian and a wonderful friend. I will miss him
dearly.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr., a Republican from Fort Lauderdale, Fla.,
was vacationing in Alabama. He said he was shocked to learn of
Chiles' death while watching the impeachment debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a close friend to all of us in Congress, both
Republicans and Democrats. ... I certainly was looking ahead to see
what his next career would be,'' Shaw said, noting that Chiles had
been a senator and governor. ``It's going to be a great loss as a
friend as well as a public servant.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mark Foley, a Republican from West Palm Beach, Fla., called
Chiles ``one of the legendary figures who will be remembered long
after his demise.'' Foley said Chiles cared about the people who
would would never be able to vote for him, children and the
disenfranchised.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Senator Connie Mack said he was saddened by Chiles'
death and paid tribute to Chiles' 40 years in public service.
``Through his service in the state Legislature, U.S. Senate and as
Florida's governor, Lawton Chiles touched the lives of many people.

 &HT;    Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles dies at mansion
 &HT;    By Charles Elmore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Gov. Lawton Chiles, the ``Old He-Coon'' who
masterminded the state's $11 billion tobacco victory and spent his
political capital to buy children's health, died Saturday of an
apparent heart attack at 68.
</P>
<P>
   There were 24 days left in the job he said he liked the most.
Despite numerous job overtures, he still said he planned to retire
after a 40-year career in which he never lost an election for the
state Legislature, the U.S. Senate and finally, Florida governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``This week he was concerned about getting up in the morning and
not having anything to do and not having anyplace to go,'' said
longtime confidant Mallory Horne, a hunting and fishing buddy. ``It
was almost a prophecy.''
</P>
<P>
   The man who earned the name ``Walkin' Lawton'' for a campaign
walk across the state, died during a daily workout at the
Governor's Mansion. An FDLE agent found his body shortly after 4
p.m. lying next to some exercise equipment. Chiles could not be
revived and was pronounced dead by emergency crews.
</P>
<P>
   He was to have attended a midafternoon reception at the mansion
for Florida Department of Law Enforcement agents and state aircraft
pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay was flown back from a stay in
Massachusetts on Saturday evening to be sworn in as governor.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, impeachment hearings came a temporary halt late
Saturday afternoon for a moment of silence. And from Jerusalem,
President Clinton issued a statement calling Chiles ``a statesman,
a role model, and one of the most respected public officials in the
latter half of the Twentieth Century.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov.-elect Jeb Bush, told of the news in Miami, remembered
something Chiles had once said: ``I didn't come here to stay. I
come to make a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He has made a difference and his mark on history is as deep as
his commitment and love for the people of Florida,'' Bush said.
``Our state has lost a legend who always stood up for those in
need, and who leaves a legacy of unequaled compassion for Florida's
children.''
</P>
<P>
   Scores of friends, aides and reporters gathered outside the
ante-bellum style Governor's Mansion, where white Christmas lights
twinkled incongruously amid the ivy-covered iron fence and from
holly wreaths decorating the second-floor balconies. Above the
portico, three flags _ the United States Flag, the flag from when
Florida joined the Union, and the Florida state flag _ all flew at
half mast.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart is with him,'' said Harold Lewis, a 45-year political
buddy from Lake Worth who Chiles reluctantly had to let go from his
administration last year because of questionable loans Lewis
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   In silence, they watched a hearse carrying Chiles' body as it
left the Governor's Mansion and turned onto Adams Street to be
taken to Tallahassee Memorial Hospital. Lewis saluted.
</P>
<P>
   Former Chiles general counsel Dexter Douglass and current
general counsel Dan Stengle shared a tearful embrace.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still alive,'' said Douglass, who helped Chiles win a $13
billion lawsuit against the tobacco industry. ``In all the
children, in clean government. All those things are still alive.''
</P>
<P>
   The governor's wife, Rhea Chiles, grieved privately inside the
Tallahassee mansion where the couple had lived for eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's shocked but I think she's going to be OK,'' Stengle
said.
</P>
<P>
   Funeral arrangements will be announced later, aides said.
</P>
<P>
   Chiles is the third Florida governor to die in office and the
first since Dan T. McCarty on Sept. 28, 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Chiles' death stunned friends who had seen him overcome numerous
health problems: depression (treated with Prozac), vision problems
(corrected by surgery) and a stroke-like attack. He had come back
fit and ready for political battle time each time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kept himself in good shape,'' said state Sen. Tom Rossin
(D-West Palm Beach), who said Chiles had played tennis at his home
while a U.S. Senator. ``The fact he died next to exercise equipment
shows the kind of discipline he had.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiles had an easy-going manner but he proved a fierce political
adversary. He once called the state's lawsuit against the tobacco
industry for health care costs ``the best fight I've ever gotten
into.'' It produced $13 billion for the state over the next 20
years.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said, ``He displayed courage time and time
again, most recently challenging the nation's top cigarette
manufacturers and emerging victorious.''
</P>
<P>
   His fight to improve children's health is also a large part of
his legacy. Florida's infant mortality dropped 34 percent during
his tenure, which led the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida's children have lost their most powerful advocate,''
said Jack Levine, executive director of the Florida Center for
Children and Youth. ``He not only was responsible for millions of
children in this nation being healthier, but he was directly
responsible for thousands of child advocates with his inspiration,
his charisma and his character.''
</P>
<P>
   Levine and others had planned a Valentine's Day tribute to say
thanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts so much to not say those things to his face and now
say them to his memory,'' Levine said, his voice breaking. ``I know
he knew, but we needed to say it just one more time.''
</P>
<P>
   The news stopped impeachment hearings in Washington, where
Chiles was a Senator for 18 years. Rep. Robert Wexler (D-Boca
Raton) broke into the debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have just been informed ... that our finest public servant,
Gov. Lawton Chiles, has died,'' Wexler said.
</P>
<P>
   Chiles was ``a throwback to the age when partisanship doesn't
play the role it plays'' and the ``embodiment of what's good about
America,'' Wexler said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill McCollum (R-Orlando) said he remembered the care and
attention Chiles took in touring storm damage earlier this year in
McCollum's district.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been a good man and a good governor of Florida,''
McCollum said.
</P>
<P>
   The committee observed a moment of silence for Chiles before the
hearing resumed.
</P>
<P>
   In Florida, even Chiles' fiercest political adversaries paid
tribute. Tom Slade, chairman of the Republican Party of Florida,
led the GOP effort to take control of the state Legislative but
could never beat Chiles. Slade called him ``a man who defined
public service.''
</P>
<P>
   They served in the state Legislature together in the 1960s and
once made up two-thirds of a sailing crew on a trip to the Bahamas
that Slade recalled fondly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lawton, it was great walkin' with you,'' Slade said.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker John Thrasher (R-Orange Park) said ``the state has
lost a great man today, one who can never be replaced.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He loved being governor,'' said Stengle, Chiles' general
counsel. ``He loved it every day. It was his highest privilege of
his 40-year career to be governor of this state that he loved so
much.''

 &HT;    Chiles' political career
 &HT;    By Lynne Palombo and Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   1958 - A 28-year-old lawyer in Lakeland and a newcomer to
politics, Chiles runs for the state House against 10-year incumbent
Roy Surles. Knocking on every door in Polk County, Chiles beats the
odds and wins.
</P>
<P>
   1959 - Chiles rebels against the Pork Choppers, rural lawmakers
who divided the state spoils for themselves. Chiles would spend the
next seven years in the House fighting for open government.
</P>
<P>
   1966 - Wins a seat in the state Senate. Pushes laws requiring
lobbyists to register and forcing the Senate to meet in public.
Helps write the 1968 Constitution, which remains in place today.
</P>
<P>
   1970 - If walking his house district won him his first election,
Chiles reasons, maybe walking the entire state will win him a U.S.
Senate seat. He is challenged by ex-governor Farris Bryant and
Alcee Hastings of Fort Lauderdale and Joel Daves of West Palm
Beach. Voters love it; He defeats the favored Bryant in a runoff
after walking 1,003 miles.
</P>
<P>
   1971 - ``Walkin' Lawton'' is sworn in, beginning 18 years as a
U.S. Senator.

 &HT;    Andrew Johnson impeachment trial also partisan, Emory professor
says
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Senate Republicans believed they had the votes to doom
Andrew Johnson's presidency after his 1868 impeachment trial, the
only one in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
   But Edmund Ross of Kansas shocked, dismayed and incensed his GOP
colleagues by voting against Johnson's impeachment, which failed 35
to 19 _ one vote shy of the two-thirds majority needed to remove a
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a man who despised Johnson and believed he was
absolutely wrong but concluded his obligation under the
Constitution rose above his hatred toward Johnson,'' Emory
University history professor Dan Carter said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Ross was ruined politically.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lesson a lot of moderate Republicans are probably
looking at right now,'' Carter said.
</P>
<P>
   Carter, the prize-winning biographer of George Wallace and an
expert on Reconstruction, said there are more differences than
similarities between Johnson's impeachment trial of 1868 and the
travails of President Clinton today.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a Tennessee Democrat, was Abraham Lincoln's vice
president. He became the nation's 17th president when Lincoln was
assassinated on April 14, 1865.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson drew the ire of Republicans when he said Southern states
could be readmitted to the Union with little federal oversight.
</P>
<P>
   When Southern states failed to grant rights to newly emancipated
slaves, Congress exerted military control over the South. But
Johnson removed Edwin Stanton, secretary of war, without notifying
the Senate. The move was a repudiation of the Tenure of Office Act,
a law designed to prevent Johnson from firing appointees. For this
reason, the House voted 126-47 in support of articles of
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnson was terribly wrong in terms of his politics,'' Carter
said. ``The Republicans were right. Something had to be done. Had
it not and had it been left up to Andrew Johnson, we wouldn't have
the 14th and 15th amendments to the Constitution,'' which granted
equal protection and voting rights to African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   But the essence of the impeachment charges against Johnson came
down to his challenge of the constitutionality of the Tenure Of
Office Act. ``That's not the kind of issue that should have risen
to the level of an impeachment offense,'' Carter said. ``It's
something that should have been settled by the U.S. Supreme Court,
which did, in fact, later declare the act unconstitutonal.''
</P>
<P>
   The fundamental parallel between today's impeachment proceedings
and those of 1868 is that partisan politics is playing a big role,
Carter said. ``In both cases, you have a handful of swing votes in
the middle and both are called moderate Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   What few people recall, Carter said, is that the House voted
80-27 to condemn Johnson _ much like a censure _ before it moved to
impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 6, 1868, the House passed a resolution saying the House
``utterly condemns the conduct of Andrew Johnson'' for transferring
the ``gallant'' Gen. P.H. Sheridan from his duties in the South.
Sheridan had used aggressive military tactics to put down
disturbances in the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one ever raised the question back then of whether that was
constitutional,'' Carter noted. ``They just passed a resolution of
condemnation, or censure.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, unlike Clinton, never admitted he had done anything
wrong. The story goes, Carter said, that Johnson was having a
meeting when handed a vote that the Senate had failed by one vote
to impeach him. Johnson calmly read the message and then, without
changing expression, went on with his conversation.
</P>
<P>
   The issues at stake during the Johnson presidency were much
graver than those of today, said Carter, who describes himself as
no defender of Clinton's. ``With Johnson, the issues involved
fundamental questions on human rights and liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton, the arguments about perjury and obstruction are
serious, Carter said. ``But it's still fundamentally about private
consensual sexual acts.... To compare that to the fundamental
questions of impeachment during the Johnson trial really just
boggles the mind.''

 &HT;    MacKay sworn as interim governor
 &HT;    By Shirish Date
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Under possibly the worst circumstances
imaginable, Buddy MacKay is finally the governor of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Not six weeks after Floridians handed him his third and likely
final defeat in a statewide election and with just 24 days left
until the man who beat him takes over, Kenneth Hood MacKay Jr.
becomes Florida's 42nd governor upon the sudden death of his
friend, Lawton Chiles.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay, 65, was in Cambridge, Mass., Saturday when Chiles'
staffers tracked him down with the news. He returned to Florida
immediately, and general counsel Dan Stengle arranged a hasty
swearing in _ a formality, he said, because the state Constitution
automatically makes the lieutenant governor the new chief executive
upon a governor's death.
</P>
<P>
   Barring a natural disaster, however, there is little governing
left for MacKay to do between now and Gov.-elect Jeb Bush's
inauguration on Jan. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's team is responsible for preparing the next year's budget.
The last Cabinet meeting of the year was last week. And Chiles
filled two Supreme Court openings _ one by himself, one in
consultation with Bush _ also last week.
</P>
<P>
   MacKay had not yet shared publicly his plans after Bush's
inauguration. He and his wife, Anne, own a small house in a quiet,
downtown Tallahassee neighborhood, but still consider Ocala their
home. Now, however, those plans most go on hold so MacKay can add
``caretaker governor'' to the list of offices he has held in nearly
three decades in public life.
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1953 has a governor died in office, and not since 1987
_ when Gov. Bob Graham resigned three days early to take his oath
for the U.S. Senate _ has a lieutenant governor stepped in for his
running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Graham's lieutenant, Wayne Mixson, though, served a term like
most second-in-commands in Florida history: notable only for their
near invisibility. For eight years, MacKay has been anything but.
</P>
<P>
   Chiles' thorniest, politically least savory tasks _
restructuring Florida's troubled welfare agency; overseeing the
financial reorganization of Miami _ often fell to MacKay to manage.
Insiders call him a ``policy wonk,'' a manager able and willing to
dig his hands into the messy innards of a problem _ quite the
opposite of Chiles' style of absorbing the big picture but
delegating the details.
</P>
<P>
   Outwardly, MacKay resembles his friend and predecessor: both
Florida natives, both University of Florida-trained lawyers, both
elderly, both silver haired, both thin and trim from regular
physical exercise.
</P>
<P>
   But the similarities end there. While Chiles was able to fire
off homespun witticisms (``The old he-coon walks just before the
light of day''), MacKay in public is wooden, often unable to convey
the passion he nevertheless feels.
</P>
<P>
   Politically, MacKay shared Chiles' fiscal conservatism, but
parted ways on social issues such as abortion and school prayer.
Despite his Old Florida roots in Ocala, MacKay has held
traditionally liberal views on everything from race relations _ he
helped found his own Presbyterian church when the one he grew up in
would not accept blacks _ to gay rights. Although born to a citrus
farming family, MacKay is an ardent environmentalist.
</P>
<P>
   But without MacKay, Chiles might never have been governor.
</P>
<P>
   It was MacKay who, having fallen a few votes short in his
attempt to succeed Chiles in the U.S. Senate in 1988, barely a year
later talked his friend out of his depression and his retirement to
return to public life as Florida's 41st governor.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two years, MacKay again tried to succeed Chiles,
and, last month, again failed.
</P>
<P>
   And so, after 12 years in the Florida Legislature, six years in
the U.S. House of Representatives and seven years and 341 days as
Florida's lieutenant governor, MacKay will once more serve the
state, this time for three and a half weeks in a job voters
overwhelmingly decided not to give him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say your prayers for Buddy MacKay,'' Chiles confidant Dexter
Douglass said, empathizing with the emotional task the next three
weeks will present. ``He just suffered a terrible loss tonight.''

   MIDEAST-IMPEACH _ JERUSALEM _ Facing Republican demands that he
admit lying before a grand jury, President Clinton insisted Sunday
that he did not perjure himself and said he will not resign. ``I
cannot admit to doing something that I am quite sure I did not
do,'' he said at a press conference with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu. Clinton urged the House to listen to ``75
percent of the American people'' and censure him instead of voting
for impeachment. Story will wrap in the day's other impeachment

   MIDEAST-PEACE _ JERUSALEM _ President Clinton urged Israelis and
Palestinians to engage in ``honest discussion,'' not violence, as
they seek to resolve their differences over the Wye River
land-for-peace deal. As the president sought to get the peace
process back on track, there were indications that the Israelis
will continue to insist on delaying scheduled troop withdrawals
from Palestinian territories. (Deans, Cox News Service)

<P>
   MIDEAST-BILLFANS _ JERUSALEM Clinton may be in trouble on
Capitol Hill, but he is overwhelmingly popular with most Israelis.
A few months ago, a Gallup poll indicated that, if they could, more
Israelis would vote for him to be their Prime Minister than either
the man they have, Benjamin Netanyahu, or his opposition, Ehud
Barak. (Kaplow, Cox News Service)

 &HT;    Local banks, thrifts say they'll be ready for Y2K
 &HT;    By Danielle Herubin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ For the past 21 months, Fidelity
Federal's Anita Mixon and 13 others have been testing the thrift's
computers to make sure time doesn't leave them behind on Jan. 1,
2000.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes well at Fidelity Federal and other institutions,
computers will move smoothly into the 21st century; ATMs will
continue to dispense cash, your checks and payments will clear, and
bank and thrift computers will remember who you are, how much is in
your account and, of course, how much you owe.
</P>
<P>
   If not, hang on to your statements and receipts.
</P>
<P>
   The scene at Fidelity Federal is being repeated locally and
throughout the nation as financial institutions work to solve the
so-called Y2K problem. Though it affects all industries, Y2K's most
profound impact could be on banks, thrifts, credit unions _ and
their customers. Financial institutions rely on computers for
nearly everything they do, from processing checks to running ATMs.
If the computers aren't reprogrammed to recognize the new century
on Jan. 1, 2000 . . . well, you get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Just how serious the problem could be depends on who is doing
the predicting.
</P>
<P>
   Most think there would be relatively minor inconveniences such
as an ATM that won't work or a credit card buy that won't be
approved. But others fear the nation's financial system _ tied
together by computer connections _ could collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Bank and thrift officials say they'll be ready, but they quickly
add there is a lot more work to be done.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has set a series of dates for
institutions to meet certain goals. By Dec. 31, they must prove
they have tested their internal, critical computer systems. By
March 31, they have to prove that every computer service they use
is Y2K ready. Then by June 30, every institution should have every
computer system tested.
</P>
<P>
   As of early November, nearly 5,800 institutions nationwide were
on schedule, 175 were lagging behind, and eight were showing
unsatisfactory progress, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
reported. The FDIC declined to identify the institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The banks are working very hard through their Y2K programs,
and the progress to date has been very good,'' said Lynn Fox, a
spokeswoman for the Federal Reserve Board of Governors in
Washington, D.C. ``We're optimistic that the majority will be
prepared and ready for the rollover.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Fed is preparing for some type of Y2K-related
problem: It plans to circulate an extra $50 billion in cash late
next year to ensure that paper money won't run short if there is a
run on institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Local institutions, large and small, have invested much time and
many resources in the effort.
</P>
<P>
   NationsBank and its Charlotte-based parent, BankAmerica, say the
effort has been enormous. As of last month, about 3,300 employees
were going over 90,000 desktop computers and rewriting 200 million
lines of computer code from nearly 300 different software packages,
looking for any bug that could cause the system to go awry. The
bank, which bought Jacksonville-based Barnett Banks earlier this
year, is spending an estimated $550 million in its search for
glitches.
</P>
<P>
   West Palm Beach-based Fidelity Federal Savings Bank has spent
nearly $800,000 out of a $2.3 million Y2K budget in its search,
said Mixon, the thrift's vice president for information services.
It has turned up a smattering of software that wasn't ready, some
computer forms that wouldn't recognize the new century, and ATM
machines that needed a complete upgrading.
</P>
<P>
   Even Grand Bank of Florida _ which hasn't opened its first
account _ has seven people looking at the problem. William Haines,
who is in charge of Y2K fixes at West Palm Beach-based Grand, said
he has to make sure the bank's new equipment will state accurately
when CDs mature and loans are repaid. ``For a new bank, the burden
is proving that everything you buy . . . is Year 2000 compliant,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   No problem is too small.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Federal investigated its copiers, its fax machines and
its phone systems, and found they were ready, Mixon said. It even
looked at its heating and ventilating system. (They passed, too.)
</P>
<P>
   Fred Martin, president of the recently opened Independent
Community Bank in Tequesta, said forms the bank buys have to be
checked to make sure they aren't preprinted with the ``19'' prefix.
</P>
<P>
   All this work hasn't come without a cost _ already well into the
billions across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   New York-based Citigroup alone will spend about $925 million, it
estimated in a recent report to the government. And Chase Manhattan
plans to spend more than $360 million.
</P>
<P>
   Local institutions are opening their vaults, too. Fort
Pierce-based Harbor Federal Savings Bank estimates it will spend
just less than $1 million. North Palm Beach-based Community Savings
Bank said it is spending $1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is taking a big hit. Grand Bank says it will spend
less than $25,000 by the time its doors open on Feb. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Institutions will pass along those costs in higher fees, though
analysts haven't put a price tag on the amount consumers will bear.
But institutions already have been increasing fees to pay for the
Y2K costs and will continue to do so, said Kenneth Thomas, a
banking consultant in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the preparations, institutions also are required by the
government to create fall-back plans.
</P>
<P>
   Community Savings said it will change computer data companies if
they cannot satisfy the thrift that computers will be ready in
time, said Mary Lou Kaminske, senior vice president of operations.
``You make contingency plans,'' she said. ``We want to be able to
service our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   A group of banks in South Florida, including Union Bank in Fort
Lauderdale, is discussing sharing a new computer system to handle
deposits and other daily business transactions should things go
awry, said Grand Bank's Haines. He said his bank is considering
joining the group ``just in case.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Community, Fidelity Federal's Mixon said the thrift is
exploring switching computer companies should it come to that. ``We
have to feel comfortable by Dec. 31 (next year),'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the potential problems, there's no need to panic, she
said.

   MIDEAST-CLINTON (Jerusalem) _ Combative and stone-faced,
President Clinton flatly denied on Sunday that he had committed
perjury, as he reluctantly interrupted his efforts to rescue the
Middle East peace plan to address an impeachment vote he said he
cannot control. By James Bennet.
</P>
<P>
   MIDEAST-CLINTON-SCENE (Jerusalem) _ President Clinton may have

   NAZI-SLAVELABOR (Frankfurt, Germany) _ Spurred on by Germany's
new Social Democratic government and a huge trans-Atlantic merger,
Germany's banks and industrial conglomerates are urgently trying to
devise a broad new plan to compensate Holocaust survivors and
millions of Poles, Russians, and other Europeans enslaved by the
Nazis. The corporations, from Deutsche Bank AG to Siemens and
DaimlerChrysler AG, want to free themselves from a slew of new
American class-action lawsuits alleging that they profited by
collaborating with the Nazis during World War II. The controversy
also threatens to pull in U.S. government officials who, for now,
are taking a cautious approach to direct involvement. By Barry
Meier and Edmund L. Andrews.

   IRELAND-NEUTRALITY (Dublin) _ The Irish government is moving

maintained since gaining independence from Britain 76 years ago. By
James F. Clarity. 1000 words.

trend: the sharp increase in the number of youngsters with Type 2
diabetes, also known as adult-onset diabetes, an incurable and
progressively damaging disease that can cause kidney failure,
blindness and poor circulation, which, in turn, can lead to
amputation. Doctors long believed the disease occurred only during

   PRINCE-EGYPT-CREATOR (Hollywood) _ What makes executives
responsible for ``The Prince of Egypt'' nervous is that this
animated film is a somber musical saga designed for adults and
children who are not toddlers. One of its creators says he he has
sought to make a film that borrows far less from the cartoon
tradition and far more from David Lean's ``Lawrence of Arabia,''
and even from the French impressionist Claude Monet and from the
biblical etchings of the 19th-century illustrator Gustave Dore. By

   TV-SCIENTOLOGY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Is Scientology a religion or a

live happier, more rewarding lives, or are they being exploited?
These issues are discussed in the A&AMP;E Investigative Report ``Inside

relatively easygoing nice guy into a hard-driving managed-care

sizable competitors, Aetna is making a risky bet that it can

despite hugely expensive advertising campaigns that promote each

with shares that are valued far beyond reason. By Denise Caruso.
</P>
<P>
   BELLSOUTH-MARKETPLACE (Undated) _ Why is BellSouth Corp. talking
up its stock? While the speculation is nowhere near a boil, it is

Telecommunications Act of 1996. By Seth Schiesel.

 &HT;    ESCAPING IMPEACHMENT ENEMIES AT HOME, CLINTON FINDS FRIENDS IN
ISRAEL
 &HT;    With MIDEAST IMPEACH and MIDEAST-PEACE.
 &HT;    For use on Monday, Dec. 14
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW

<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM Binyamin Blum stood waiting on the street at 1 a.m.
Sunday because he believed President Clinton needed a sign of
support.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year-old Israeli was one of a small group who came in
hopes of catching a brief glimpse of Clinton as his motorcade sped
into his hotel shortly after the president arrived from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like the president and we don't want to see him get
impeached. We want to show our support,'' Blum said as he huddled
in the cold next to his American girlfriend. ``If he would run for
(Israeli) prime minister, he would win.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a joke, but it might be right.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is in trouble back home with a Congress considering his
impeachment. On Sunday, the first full day of his 3-day peace
mission, he appeared downcast after a tough closed-door session
with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Last week, nine
members of the right-wing Israeli cabinet hinted they would have
preferred that Clinton stay away rather than come pressure Israel
to proceed with the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton is overwhelmingly popular with most Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, a Gallup Poll showed that, if they could, more
Israelis would vote for him to be their prime minister than either
Netanyahu or the leader of the opposition, Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's biggest peace group, Peace Now, had planned a laser
light show that would write ``Welcome'' across a field that
Clinton's helicopter would cross on Saturday night. But police
stopped it for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Special for Clinton'ht wing do not agree. Clinton has been a
target of the so-called ``settler movement'' _ those who oppose
pressure from Washington to halt Israeli settlements in Palestinian
territories. They and many other Isrhe peace plan that was signed
in Washington last October after Clinton mediated nine days of
Israeli-Palestinian talks at the Wye River Plantation in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Posters reading ``Clinton go home'' showed up on walls in
Jerusalem just days before he arrived.
</P>
<P>
   But the Hebrew daily newspaper Ma'ariv carried a headline in
English Sunday stating, ``Welcome, Mister President'' and a column
from the paper's editor, Yaacov Erez, stated: ``We all hope, save
for the radical fringes, that Clinton will be able to bridge the
abyss at out feet, exhibit his magic touch in his talks with
(Palestinian leader Yasser) Arafat and Netanyahu, and restore the
hope of peace to our chests.''
</P>
<P>
   One Israeli television station dedicated all-day coverage to
Clinton's visit Sunday. It showed not only his press conference
with Netanyahu, but First Lady Hillary Clinton's visit to a school
and daughter Chelsea Clinton standing amid praying Orthodox Jews at
the Western Wall, sacred in Judaism.
</P>
<P>
   In the flower shop that prepared the white roses and fruit
baskets for Clinton's hotel room, the clerk is trendy 22-year-old
Liz Eliav, who wears black leather pants and supports Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   She thinks Clinton is pushing the peace process too hard in an
effort to compensate for his domestic political problems. But, she
likes him anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has such a charm when he speaks, he has such warmth and
kindness,'' Eliav said. ``When he came here (for Rabin's funeral),
he did it for kindness. It's an honor to the Jewish people.''

`THE BLUE ROOM': FOOL'S GOLD IN THE KINGDOM OF DESIRE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes are at the end of review.) 
(js) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A distinct chill emanates from the hottest show on
Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blue Room,'' the David Hare play that New Yorkers would
seemingly sacrifice their firstborn to get into, opened Sunday
night at the Cort Theater for a 12-week run with an advance sale
topping $4 million and all but the tiniest percentage of its
tickets spoken for.
</P>
<P>
   How, really, could it have been otherwise, with its promised
catnip cocktail of sex, culture and celebrity? Not to mention such
drum-beating phenomena as last week's Newsweek cover, with the
show's star, Nicole Kidman, in a sultrier-than-thou pose, and
drooling advance notices from London, where the production
originated. One phrase, from a review in The Daily Telegraph of
London, has already attached itself to the show like a sandwich
board: ``pure theatrical Viagra.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet those who take their seats expecting a highbrow equivalent
of a blue movie (remember ``Emmanuelle''?) may wind up donning
their overcoats. Blue, in Hare's reworking of ``La Ronde,'' Arthur
Schnitzler's fabled portrait of love as an erotic relay race in
turn-of-the-century Vienna, is a cool color, a shiver-making shade
signifying, if not exactly nothing, then the loneliness, emptiness
and futility of human encounters.
</P>
<P>
   Blue is what you see, in the words of a song in the play, when
you step aside from life and realize that ``the earth looks kind of
circular and hollow.'' Accordingly, the metaphoric room of the
title, given fluidly changing life by the set designer Mark
Thompson, has no need of an asbestos lining. The carnal couplings
among the play's 10 characters, all dexterously played by Ms.
Kidman, the Australian-born movie star, and the English stage actor
Iain Glen, ignite a few ephemeral sparks but no roaring flames.
Each coital vignette ends in an exasperated but philosophical shrug
in the soulless neon glow of Hugh Vanstone's lighting.
</P>
<P>
   A shrug, and an occasional worldly chuckle, is pretty much all
that ``The Blue Room'' elicits. As staged by Sam Mendes, the
fast-rising director behind the hit revival of ``Cabaret,'' this
100-minute, intermissionless evening is a deft, efficient and
sometimes amusing piece of work. Its thematic thrust is so
self-evident, and so familiar, as to preclude lively post-theater
debate, and it doesn't stir you emotionally. The show is best
appreciated as a range-stretching exercise for actors. It is not
unlike a darker version of Neil Simon's comedies set in a single
hotel suite.
</P>
<P>
   That one of the performers is Ms. Kidman, the wife of Tom Cruise
and the star of the films ``Practical Magic'' and (most memorably)
``To Die For,'' has much to do, of course, with what has made ``The
Blue Room'' a must-see event. Theater ghouls who thrive on watching
big stars from another medium stumble onstage have nothing to dine
out on here.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Kidman gives a winningly accomplished performance, shifting
accents and personae with an assured agility that never stoops to
showing off or grandstanding. It is also a performance that
obviates prurience, despite the fact that she often wears very
little and at one point, only briefly, nothing at all. (And yes, as
one of Glen's characters observes, feasting on the vision of the
nude Ms. Kidman, she has nothing at all to be ashamed of.) Her
roles range from a Cockney streetwalker to a Continental au pair
girl, from a teen-age American model to a grande dame of the
theater. Her comic timing is effortless, and she provides the
evening with its biggest laugh. That comes when the coked-out model
responds to a lover's question as to whether his particular brand
of sexual stimulation satisfies her. Her dazed answer: ``I don't
know what you're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   She also generates the play's only glimmers of real pathos,
letting her face fleetingly betray an irritation that shades into
despair when her characters realize that the expectation of sex is
as good as sex gets. ``It would have been better on the bench,''
says the prostitute, after a brusque copulation on a riverside
quay, with a mixture of defiance and forlornness. That, of course,
is Hare's main point, that sex would always have been better
somewhere else, at some other time, with another person; erotic
satisfaction is a chimera, the elusive quarry of an eternal and
fruitless hunt.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The male characters, being more intellectual than the women
here, give fuller voice to this poignant if less than original
theory, especially the foppish, self-infatuated playwright and the
wistful, intellectual aristocrat of the concluding scenes. Glen has
the harder row to hoe of the two stars, since the men of ``The Blue
Room'' tend to be blind and fatuous, swaggering macho jokes with
little redeeming self-consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   But this actor, who leaned toward caricature when I saw him in
London, has definitely improved, modulating his performance in
welcome ways. There's little depth in any of his portrayals, but
that may be built into the quick-sketch nature of the play. Like
Ms. Kidman, he is comely and willowy, and he gamely performs an
adroit cartwheel in the altogether.
</P>
<P>
   That moment isn't especially titillating, but then ``The Blue
Room'' isn't a titillating play. Though the actors work well
together, there's little erotic chemistry between them; you never
feel that in any of their incarnations, they are truly lusting for
each other. This is a work, after all, in which the exact time it
takes to perform each of the play's acts of copulation is projected
in a supertitle, a witty touch that palls by the evening's end.
That's what sex comes down to here: a quantifiable, mechanical
activity that doesn't, according to the evidence at hand, even seem
especially pleasurable.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Ms. Kidman's presence, ``The Blue Room'' isn't glamorous
either. There is none of the visual sumptuousness, set off by
swirling waltzes and equally swirling camera movement, of the
famous French film version of ``La Ronde'' by Max Ophuls.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, Hare comes closer than Ophuls did to the tone of
Schnitzler's original play, originally titled ``Reigen'' (``Round
Dance''), and not intended by its author for public performance.
Schnitzler, a doctor as well as a writer, cast a clinical eye on
the delusions of the society he inhabited. But in mixing members of
different classes in a rigidly stratified Vienna into a shifting
waltz of desire, he illuminated the plaintiveness of high but vain
hopes for something better in life, for love as a transformational
force.
</P>
<P>
   In Hare's universe, those hopes have been bleached out by the
sexual and social revolutions of the succeeding decades. Dashed
expectations have always been this playwright's specialty, and in
works like ``Plenty'' and ``Skylight,'' he has brought an angry,
vivifying passion to the subject. In ``The Blue Room,'' however,
his characters stride onto the sexual playing field all too aware
of the rules of a no-win game.
</P>
<P>
   This means that they never seem to be risking very much, even in
terms of what one character delicately labels ``hygiene.'' (AIDS
and other sexually transmitted diseases are not a topic of
conversation.) People get bored or vaguely anxious, but they're all
wearing too much psychic armor to be bruised anymore;
disappointment is a donnee.
</P>
<P>
   In only one of the scenes, in which the feckless model and her
politician lover pop one mood-altering pill too many, do things
threaten to get nasty. Ms. Kidman and Glen are at their strongest
in this vignette, growing ever more animalistic in ways that
suggest that passion can indeed push people into dangerous terrain.
It's a startling, uncomfortable moment, and it gives off a quality
that nothing else in the evening does: spontaneous life.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, everything remains in control in ``The Blue Room,''
from its jokes (occasionally a shade too obvious) at its
characters' expense to its calculated flashes of nudity. The entire
evening is not unlike Ms. Kidman's much-discussed body: smooth,
pale and slender.

ADVERTISING: OMNICOM'S EMPIRE EXPANDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A big year for big deals on Madison Avenue is coming to a close
with the biggest acquisition in the history of Omnicom Group, the
world's largest agency company.
</P>
<P>
   Omnicom, with $31.7 billion in billings, is adding to an empire
that already includes BBDO Worldwide, DDB Needham Worldwide and
TBWA Worldwide with an agreement to buy the shares it did not
already own in Abbott Mead Vickers PLC, the world's 20th-largest
agency company, with $1.6 billion in billings. Omnicom will acquire
the rest of Abbott Mead, which is affiliated with BBDO, in an
exchange of stock that Omnicom valued at about $545 million.
</P>
<P>
   That is the most Omnicom has paid in a transaction since the
agency company was formed 12 years ago by the merger of BBDO, Doyle
Dane Bernbach and Needham Harper Worldwide. By comparison, Omnicom
spent an estimated $462.1 million on all acquisitions last year.
</P>
<P>
   And the price Omnicom is paying is more than four times what had
until now been the biggest agency deal of 1998, the acquisition of
Arnold Communications by Snyder Communications for $125 million in
stock.
</P>
<P>
   Omnicom has owned a stake in Abbott Mead since 1991, when the
British office of BBDO was sold to Abbott Mead, which then formed
an agency known as Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO. That agency, based in
London, is now Britain's largest, and among the most highly
regarded for creative prowess.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a great relationship with them,'' John Wren,
president and chief executive of Omnicom in New York, said on
Friday, referring to the top executives of Abbott Mead, ``and we're
looking forward to working more closely in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This makes sure the management of both companies is working on
the same issues to develop the BBDO brand,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO has billings estimated at $594.5
million from clients including Aer Lingus, British
Telecommunications, The Economist and Volvo, as well as accounts
shared with BBDO like Pepsico and the Duracell International unit
of Gillette.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really going to be no change to speak of, certainly
not initially,'' Wren said. ``We don't want to do anything that
would disturb the success of the company, its ability to grow as it
has.''
</P>
<P>
   Lorna Tilbian, an advertising industry analyst with West LB
Panmure in London, echoed Wren's assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there'll be any change,'' she said, ``because
this isn't the usual type of acquisition where there are worries
about chemistry.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Wren said, while he and the top executives of Abbott
Mead ``all agreed in the near term, the next 12 to 24 months, that
they continue to run and manage what they have been running and
managing, in the longer term I can see a role for Mead at
Omnicom.'' His reference was to Peter Mead, executive chairman at
Abbott Mead.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Abbott Mead Vickers BBDO, Abbott Mead owns
agencies that specialize in tasks outside the realm of traditional
advertising, offering services like interactive marketing, media
buying, direct marketing, sales promotion and public relations.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Ficker, advertising industry analyst for Furman Selz LLC
in New York, estimated that ``just under 60 percent'' of Abbott
Mead's revenue of $176.6 million comes from such services. That is
similar to Omnicom, which according to Michael Russell, advertising
industry analyst for Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co. in New York,
derives 50 percent of its revenue of $4.2 billion from those
sources.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ficker said the diversified revenue at Abbott Mead was
``very much a positive'' for Omnicom because services apart from
advertising are expected to turn in ``a strong performance next
year'' despite ``concerns over the U.K. traditional-advertising
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Wren said he expected the acquisition to be completed in early
February, pending approval by shareholders and British courts. The
Abbott Mead board supported the deal unanimously.
</P>
<P>
   Trade publications had speculated for several years that Omnicom
would move to buy the rest of Abbott Mead. That helped push up the
price of shares of Abbott Mead, which trade on the London Stock
Exchange. The recent increase in the price of Omnicom stock, which
trades on the New York Stock Exchange, softened the financial
burden of the deal for Omnicom.
</P>
<P>
   And now for the fine print.
</P>
<P>
   The terms of the deal call for Abbott Mead shareholders to get
0.1347 newly issued Omnicom share for each Abbott Mead ordinary
share they own. Based on Friday's closing stock prices and currency
exchange rates, the deal values Abbott Mead at 422 pence ($7.14) a
share, a 17 percent premium to the price on Nov. 25. That was the
day before the two agency companies disclosed that they had begun
discussing Omnicom's taking full ownership of Abbott Mead.
</P>
<P>
   After a runup since that disclosure, Abbott Mead shares closed
unchanged on Friday at 420 pence ($7.10). Omnicom shares,
meanwhile, fell $2.50, to $53.
</P>
<P>
   Omnicom had owned a 27.7 percent stake in Abbott Mead, but ``for
technical reasons related to taxes and capital gains,'' Ms. Tilbian
said, the transaction was structured as a pooling of interests.
That required Omnicom to reduce its stake in Abbott Mead to less
than 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   So early Friday, Omnicom sold 15.1 million shares of Abbott Mead
to a trust, leaving it with about a 7.7 percent stake. As a result,
the exchange of stock will be for an estimated 92.3 percent of
Abbott Mead shares.

   IMPEACH (Washington) _ With the full House returning for a vote
on impeachment this week, President Clinton on Sunday rebuffed
Republican calls for him to admit to lying under oath and said
flatly that he had not committed perjury. He deflected calls for
him to step down. ``I have no intention of resigning,'' he said.
``It's never crossed my mind.'' Unable to escape the constitutional
crisis engulfing his presidency, the president fielded questions
about his fate in Jerusalem, where he had flown to try to revive
the Middle East peace process. Back home, leading Republicans said
he could save the nation from an impeachment trial by stepping
down.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The judgment of history after the impeachment and
near conviction of President Andrew Johnson in 1868 was that
Congress had badly overstepped proper bounds. It was 106 years
before the impeachment of a president was seriously considered
again.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, after the impeachment proceedings against President
Richard Nixon in 1974, the national consensus was that the special
prosecutors, Archibald Cox and Leon Jaworski, had been protectors
of the public weal and that Congress had acted responsibly and even
heroicly.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, every president since Nixon has faced, to one
degree or another, criminal inquiry by an independent counsel, and
Congress has used its power of investigation time and again to
settle political scores.
</P>
<P>
   By the same token, both sides argued in the House Judiciary
Committee's debate last week that the effort to impeach President
Clinton would have lasting effects on the presidency. Politicians
and scholars who were interviewed over the weekend did not dispute
that, but they disagreed over what the legacy would be.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on the Judiciary Committee maintained that a Clinton
impeachment would mean that for years to come, whenever Congress
was controlled by the party opposing the president, the president
would be in jeopardy of being impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be setting a precedent that could seriously weaken the
office of the presidency,'' said Rep. Charles Schumer of New York.
``We will be substantially lowering the bar for removing a sitting
president so that we will be in danger of all too frequently
investigating presidents and seeking to remove them from office.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, another Democrat, Rep. Bill Delahunt of
Massachusetts, said that ``the balance of power between the
branches of government is at risk,'' and he predicted that the
country was in for ``a period of partisan retribution.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans asserted that Clinton had diminished the
presidency with his reckless conduct and that the lesson for future
presidents was that they would be held to high personal standards.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas put it this way: ``If our actions send
a message that future presidents should not lie under oath; should
tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, as
President Clinton swore to do when giving testimony before a judge
and then a grand jury; that future presidents should uphold the law
as President Clinton swore to do when he took the oath of office as
president; that future presidents should not obstruct justice, as
President Clinton did for seven months as he admittedly deceived
the American people and those associated with the investigation; if
these are the precedents Congress sets, if these are the standards
future presidents then live by, we'd need not fear our actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Beschloss, a presidential historian, said that it would
take time before it was apparent which side was right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Within a few years, Americans will probably reach a consensus
on whether this was legitimate or whether members of Congress were
angry with the president because of things that went beyond the
articles of impeachment,'' Beschloss said. ``The question is how
this whole year stands up in history.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Warren Rudman, who has been following the debate
from his home in New Hampshire, said he was worried by the
direction his fellow Republicans were taking because he thought the
Constitution reserved impeachment for official misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   But Rudman said he did not foresee dire consequences for the
presidency. ``If a George W. Bush or a Bill Bradley gets elected
next time,'' he said, ``what has happened during this horrible time
will not have any effect on their presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudman continued: ``This country has been through crises with
presidents time after time. People always say the country's going
to collapse. A fresh face with a new set of ideas changes
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Wittmann, a conservative scholar at the Heritage
Foundation, said the consequences of a Clinton impeachment might
have been more severe at a different time in the nation's history _
before the end of the Cold War, for instance, or during an economic
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, ``Washington just doesn't matter as much as it once
did,'' he said, ``and neither does the presidency.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Douglas Brinkley, a historian at the University of New Orleans,
agreed with the notion that in the prosperous, peaceful 1990s, the
presidency might not be the office it once was. ``When we reflect
back at this time,'' he said, ``people like Bill Gates and Warren
Buffett and Ted Turner may be remembered more than Bill Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But the presidency has only been diminished temporarily,''
Brinkley said. The time will come, he added, when the president of
the United States will once again be the dominant figure in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The main consequence of the Clinton presidency, Brinkley said,
may be that no president will leave a historical record. Knowing
that they they are subject to incessant investigations, presidents
will not be able to afford to keep diaries or tape-record their
recollections, lest they be subpoenaed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Presidents will be careful not to leave tracks,'' he said,
``and history and historians will suffer.''

   WASHINGTON _ In opposing a censure of President Clinton, many
Republicans argued that the Constitution contains no words allowing
Congress to take that step. Perhaps not, but that has not stopped
lawmakers of yesteryear.
</P>
<P>
   The best known censure of a president was that of Andrew Jackson
by the Senate in 1834, in a policy dispute involving the nation's
finances. But any researcher who shines a flashlight into the
dustbin of history will uncover other presidential reproofs, some
with rich subplots.

   First, Jackson. Old Hickory was Old Hostile when it came to
banks; he hated them. He also mistrusted central authority, and so
vetoed the rechartering of the Second Bank of the United States in
1832, ordering government funds withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   In the long political struggle that followed, a depression
worsened and Jackson's enemies blamed him, not just for being
obstinate but, in the words of former President and
then-Congressman John Quincy Adams, ``a tone of insolence and
insult'' in his dealings with Congress.
</P>
<P>
   On March 28, 1834, the Senate voted its disapproval, 28 to 18,
of the president's actions, which it said were beyond his powers.
The resolution did not contain the word ``censure,'' but most
historians consider the measure a censure. No matter: three years
later, Jackson's allies took control of the Senate and revoked the
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest legislative attempt to censure a president occurred
in 1800, when the House of Representatives debated three
resolutions disapproving of John Adams' supposed interference with
the judiciary. The resolutions were defeated. (As for his attitude
toward the judiciary, Adams must have been doing something right:
he appointed the great Chief Justice of the United States John
Marshall.)
</P>
<P>
   The most recent attempts to censure a president were aimed at
Richard Nixon in 1973 and 1974, according to the Congressional
Research Service of the Library of Congress. One condemned Nixon
for the ``Saturday Night Massacre'' of October 1973, the other for
actions beyond his authority in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Both censure attempts, of course, were related to the Watergate
scandal and were referred to committees. The president's
resignation made them moot, and they are now all but forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Two other resolutions enacted against presidents involved men
who served almost two decades apart, but whose fates and standings
in history are linked, in a way: John Tyler and William Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   John Tyler became the first vice president to succeed to the
presidency, when William Henry Harrison died on April 6, 1841,
after only a month in office. In 1842, Tyler vetoed two tariff
bills favored by his Whig Party. His Cabinet resigned, his own
party expelled him and a resolution was introduced in the House to
investigate him for purposes of possible impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   That measure, the first impeachment proceedings ever introduced
in Congress, was defeated in January 1843. But Tyler was so
weakened that he could not even gain renomination in 1844. He
retired but _ as will be seen shortly _ his political career was
not quite over.
</P>
<P>
   Flash forward to William Buchanan, the bachelor from
Pennsylvania, who served from 1857 to 1861. Buchanan did not think
the Southern states had a right to leave the Union, but he didn't
think the federal government had the power to do anything about it
either.
</P>
<P>
   By the time he yielded the White House to Abraham Lincoln, who
had rather different ideas about secession and preserving the
Union, seven states had seceded and civil war was inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   In 1862, the Senate debated a measure of ``condemnation and
censure'' against Buchanan for his failure to prevent secession.
The measure was tabled. ``History will vindicate me,'' Buchanan
said just before his death in 1868.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   As for John Tyler, after he left the White House he was an
outspoken advocate of Southern interests as he dwelled in his
Virginia estate. In November 1861, he was elected to the new
Confederate Congress, but he died in a Richmond hotel room on Jan.
18, 1862, just before he could take his seat.
</P>
<P>
   Thus was U.S. history spared the unhappy chapter of a former
president's becoming a high official in a new country at war with
the nation whose Constitution Tyler had taken a solemn oath to
defend.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   'Tis once again that time of year when many people trim their
Christmas trees and put up decorations. Inventors have been hard at
work trying to add their own distinctive touches to holiday
displays.
</P>
<P>
   Consider never again having to untangle a string of Christmas
tree lights, or search for the solitary burned-out bulb. High
technology met Oh Tannenbaum several times in 1998, with three
different patents for fiber-optic Christmas trees that are
themselves made of light.
</P>
<P>
   David Gutshall, of Johnstown, Pa., owns one of those patents.
Gutshall designed a housing shaped like a tree trunk and base. The
trunk is covered with holes. Fiber-optic cables run from the base
of the ``tree'' up through the trunk and out the holes. The cables
that emerge from the holes near the top of the tree are longest;
the cables get shorter the closer they are to the base of the
trunk. That way, after the cables are threaded through the holes,
they can be pulled taut to form a conical shape that reaches the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   A lamp in the base shines light on the root of each fiber-optic
cable, making the cords glow in the shape of a Christmas tree.
Gutshall won patent 5,829,863.
</P>
<P>
   Heavy-Duty Trees
</P>
<P>
   Tired of the same old hanging ornaments? Want to decorate your
tree with something heavier? Then you might need Steven Wilson's
Christmas tree shelving. Wilson patented a system of horizontal
shelf brackets that are mounted on the tree's trunk. Display
shelves can be attached to the brackets and extended out among the
branches of the tree to hold nontraditional Christmas decorations.
Wilson received patent 5,735,415.
</P>
<P>
   Ornaments With Surprises Inside
</P>
<P>
   There's no reason why Christmas tree ornaments cannot function
like fortune cookies, right? That seems to be what Tammy Ampomah,
from Columbus, Ohio, had in mind when she designed an ornament made
with two pieces of paper or cardboard pressed together. The flat
exterior is decorated, and the ornament comes with a hook or string
for hanging. Inside, however, are strips of paper with ``words of
wisdom, well wishes, a catch phrase or a fortune if you will,'' Ms.
Ampomah writes in her patent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other articles such as festive confetti and a penny for good
luck are also contained inside ornament to serve as gifts and
amusement for the new year,'' she adds. ``Ornament is placed on
tree at Christmas as decoration and taken from tree on New Year's
Eve or New Year's Day and given as gift. When ornament is torn
open, contents may be read, and exchanged, and confetti may be
thrown in celebration by a party or group.'' Ms. Ampomah received
patent 5,603,993.
</P>
<P>
   As the Tree Turns
</P>
<P>
   Many people ignore the back of a Christmas tree if it is
standing against a wall or in a corner. Hugh Sofy's rotating tree
stand, however, makes decorating the whole tree a possibility. The
stand is made up of a base with a spindle that is driven by a
gear-chain motor. A clutch can automatically shut down the motor,
and an alarm sounds if the tree's revolutions are obstructed.
</P>
<P>
   Sofy, from Troy, Mich., received patent 5,647,569.
</P>
<P>
   Alarming Ornament
</P>
<P>
   Now you can hang your smoke detector right on the Christmas
tree. David Solak, from Seven Hills, Ohio, has patented an
ornamental hazard detector. A round decoration that looks like a
traditional tree ornament is actually divided into upper and lower
chambers by a fire-resistant barrier. The upper houses a
transmitter, while a sensor resides in the lower one. If the sensor
detects smoke or heat seeping into the lower chamber, it triggers
the transmitter to send a signal to a remote receiver. The receiver
sets off an alarm. Solak owns patent 5,821,865.
</P>
<P>
   Permalights
</P>
<P>
   Tired of hanging and then taking down colored outdoor lights
every year? Robert Shaffer in Lacey, Wash., was. So he invented a
construction system for the permanent installation of outdoor
Christmas lights. He designed a box-like channel with a screen
cover along the bottom edge of its front wall. The channel is
mounted to the outside of a house, and can be customized to fit
pitched roofs, eaves or other architectural design elements.
</P>
<P>
   Christmas lights are inserted into the box and stretched along
the channel. When the cover screens are in place, the lights are
not visible until turned on. Once illuminated, the colored lights
shine through the screen. Shaffer received patent 5,813,751.
</P>
<P>
   Hang It
</P>
<P>
   For motorists who want to decorate their cars for the holiday,
how about a greeting card with a pocket holding an ornament. The
ornament is meant to be hung from a rear-view mirror, where it can
bounce around on its elastic cord. Hong Na, from McLean, Va.,
recommends that the ornament be made of ``intersecting sheets of
material having a glittering surface, which construction induces
rotating and swinging motion of the ornament responsive to air
currents within the vehicle, in addition to the bobbing or
oscillations caused by vehicle motion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These complex motions, combined with the colored and
glittering appearance, maximize the twinkling visual effect of this
uncomplicated device while requiring no effort on the part of the
observer or user,'' he says. And because it is for a car, he adds,
``the ornament is impregnated with a pine scent in order to further
thematically link the ornament to Christmas.'' It can also come
with a small suction cup so the ornament can be attached to a car
window. Na holds patent 5,670,219.
</P>
<P>
   Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and
Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

 ALVIN AILEY: ABSTRACT IMAGES EVOKE A TRAGEDY FROM REAL LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The latest two premieres for the Alvin Ailey American Dance
Theater's season are by dancers in the company. Both pieces were
introduced at City Center on Friday night, and both were intense in
different ways. Each suggested its novice choreographer should be
given further opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Restricted,'' Lisa Johnson was obviously telling some sort
of story whose plot line had been abstracted into powerful images.
The work had its sketchy aspects simply because specific dramatic
ideas were evoked but not developed, and yet the use of energy had
an unmistakable emotional impact.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the choreographer's program dedication, ``In
memory of Roxanne Eley,'' is relevant to the work. Asked after the
premiere to identify Ms. Eley, a company spokesman said that she
was Ms. Johnson's cousin, and that both women had grown up together
in Washington. When Ms. Eley was raped and murdered there in 1996,
it was because she was a lesbian, Ms. Johnson said. She said the
title ``Restricted'' refers to the kind of life her cousin led.
</P>
<P>
   Like this viewer, most in the audience were presumably unaware
of this background before seeing the piece, and it would be wrong
to consider it as a literal retelling of Ms. Johnson's family
tragedy. In generalized terms, the work seems to be about people
breaking free to express a sexual identity.
</P>
<P>
   Initially tied together by a symbolic rope, the four members of
the cast divide into a male-female couple and a female pair.
Choices seem to be made here about partners in dance and in life;
yet there is also a hint of confusion when, at the end, the man and
one of the women from the female pair make contact. Ms. Johnson's
strong suit is atmosphere. Although not always clear, she succeeds
in conveying a troubled emotional resonance.
</P>
<P>
   The symbolic long yellow rope in which Renee Robinson, Venus
Hall, Christina Angela Gonzales and Vernard Gilmore are entangled
does not restrict them for long. Stacey Saltzman's silvery costumes
give the dancers a starlike luster as they revolve and break loose
to flail, kick and plunge into short phrases of movement with
choppy gestures and asymmetrical shapes (knee up to one side).
</P>
<P>
   Influenced perhaps by Ulysses Dove's pieces in the repertory,
Ms. Johnson avoids a fluid ``dancey'' phrase, and like Dove she
chooses music (by Michael Mays) that is ruled by a big beat, a
piston-driving sound. The images have their mysteries: Two women
pass through a hoop formed by Gilmore's arms. In a solo, Gilmore
hits his chin with clasped hands.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Robinson and Ms. Hall revolve in an embrace, Ms. Gonzales
lies entwined in the rope, before a duet with Gilmore finds her
lying horizontally across the back of his neck and shoulders. The
dancers are splendid and Pamela Hobson's lighting, defining
rectangles as restrictive spaces, adds extra symbolism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ascension,'' the second premiere, is dedicated by the
choreographer, Troy O'Neil Powell, as follows: ``To Mom, one of the
most compassionate people I have ever known _ rest in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his dancing, O'Neil's choreography has a muscular wit. The
piece offers a punch line, but its winning grace is an overall
polish. The audience, this time, even broke out into wolf whistles
when the curtain went up on Matthew Rushing, Jeffrey Gerodias and
Glenn Sims in bathing suits and swim caps. Barbara Forbes'
costumes, for one thing, are in gorgeous green, turquoise and
purple. Brenda Dolan's lighting aptly gives the beach boy trio a
golden glow.
</P>
<P>
   As at the start, the men occasionally face the rear. But usually
they soar through space with athletic grace or push against an
invisible resisting force that gives the movement, for all its
exuberance, an exciting tension. Balletic leaps in a circle and
high leg extensions are coherently joined with more spontaneous
movement (a wiggle, shoulder rotation and beefcake pose); the solos
have punchier movement after Desiree Vlad, strutting like a true
femme fatale, enters along a diagonal.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Wimberly's music, prone to big beats, picks up a richer
texture here with light percussion; Ms. Vlad gets passed around and
at the end the men toss her into the wings and out of their club.
Draw your own conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Ailey's ``Revelations,'' also on the program, continues to be
danced wonderfully this season. Uri Sands' fluidity of movement
needs special mention; it was stunning on Wednesday when he and Ms.
Robinson gave something extra to the image of born-again baptism in
the ``Wade in the Water'' duet, which was rendered dramatically on
Friday by Dwana Adiaha Smallwood and Bernard Gaddis.
</P>
<P>
   That evening was dedicated to Meg Gordean, who has just left the
company after 29 years as its publicity agent.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aetna Inc. has transformed itself in less than three years from
an insurance giant known as a relatively easygoing nice guy into a
hard-driving managed-care company that many doctors say they hate.
Now, by swallowing two sizable competitors, Aetna is vastly
increasing its power and making a risky bet that it can dominate
the nation's health-care system.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna surprised industry insiders and investors last week by
agreeing to buy the ailing health care business of Prudential
Insurance Co. of America for a bargain price of $1 billion, or less
than $200 for each managed-care member.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few weeks ago, Aetna said that it had sworn off
mega-shopping while it digested another $1 billion-plus gulp _ the
purchase in March of NYLCare, the health care unit of New York Life
Insurance Co., for $600 a member.
</P>
<P>
   The new Aetna will have contracts with more than half the
nation's 550,000 practicing doctors outside the government and a
role in determining the medical care of 18.4 million Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to change the landscape of the whole industry,''
said Richard Huber, the chairman, chief executive and main deal
maker of Aetna, which is based in Hartford, Conn. He is plunging
Aetna deeper into health care at a moment when optimists say the
industry is returning to better times, meaning higher prices for
patients and employers.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Abramowitz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein who is a
longtime supporter of managed care, said Aetna was ``making a big
bet that borders on a gamble, but it is a very educated, worthwhile
gamble.''
</P>
<P>
   The down side is that Aetna will be so big that a serious
misstep could sour investors on the whole managed-care industry.
</P>
<P>
   With Prudential Health Care, Aetna would have had about $20
billion in revenue for the first nine months of this year, of which
$16 billion, or 80 percent, would be in health care, said Joyce
Oberdorf, a spokeswoman for Aetna.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna agreed to sell its casualty insurance business in late
1995 and used the proceeds to buy U.S. Healthcare in 1996 for
nearly $9 billion, which was more than $3,000 a member. The U.S.
Healthcare executives took charge and installed their own highly
profitable, rigorous management style.
</P>
<P>
   In the first nine months, Aetna also had about $2.5 billion of
revenue from managing $48 billion in retirement funds and pensions
and $1.5 billion from selling retirement and health care services
in foreign countries, Ms. Oberdorf said.
</P>
<P>
   Huber said that all three units _ health care, retirement and
international _were growing at double-digit rates.
</P>
<P>
   Pretax operating profit margins so far this year were 4 percent
to 5 percent in health care, Ms. Oberdorf said, 14.5 percent in
retirement services and 7 percent in international.
</P>
<P>
   Other managed-care companies have margins of 3 percent or less.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Prudential Health Care projects a loss of about $100
million this year, and the list of managed-care companies with
operating losses also includes huge companies such as Kaiser
Permanente, a nonprofit company in California that is the nation's
biggest health maintenance organization, and, in the New York
market, Oxford Health Plans and Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield.
</P>
<P>
   Aetna has high hopes of combining its networks of doctors and
hospitals with Prudential's to increase its market share in some of
the most populous states, including New York, New Jersey, Texas,
Ohio, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, Georgia and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   With advantages of size in bargaining with health care
providers, the bigger managed-care companies grew almost three
times as fast as smaller HMOs that had fewer than 100,000 members,
according to an analysis of 1997 reports to Interstudy, a nonprofit
research center, by Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, the Wall Street
securities firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being locally dominant is a major competitive advantage,''
said Mimi Willard, a health care analyst at Donaldson. ``The
largest health plans had nice profits. Two out of three of the
smaller plans were unprofitable,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But she said that it was still not clear that size would add up
to a national competitive advantage.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, based on its track record in its merger with U.S.
Healthcare, Aetna may have problems retaining all the Prudential
doctors, although many are already in both networks.
</P>
<P>
   Medical groups in several states have resisted Aetna's toughly
enforced policy of requiring doctors to accept its lowest-paying
HMO patients or give up all Aetna patients. Huber said Aetna
``absolutely'' intended to keep on insisting on these
all-or-nothing contracts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Doctors have also complained that Aetna was late in paying for
their services. Huber said Aetna was now paying these bills in 15
days, on average, and in eight days in the Northeast, where it is
switching to electronic payments.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have countered tough tactics from companies like Aetna
U.S. Healthcare by lobbying successfully for state and federal laws
that limit the HMOs on several fronts and, incidentally, add to
their costs of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   Huber contends that the managed-care companies are moving to an
era that will take them beyond their earlier stress on cutting
costs by paying lower fees to doctors and hospitals and enforcing
rules that limited referrals of patients to specialists and
expensive tests.
</P>
<P>
   After years of discounts, ``we can't get cheaper prices'' for
further savings, he said.
</P>
<P>
   So how will Aetna compete in a commodity-like business where
many of the same doctors and hospitals are available at similar
prices from the three remaining nationwide insurers _ Aetna, United
Healthcare Corp. and Cigna Corp.?
</P>
<P>
   ``If they all have the same doctors, they have to compete on the
quality of care the patient gets,'' said Douglas Sherlock, an
independent managed-care consultant in Gwynedd, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   All the big companies, as well as Kaiser and many other
well-entrenched regional HMOs, hope to compete by improving a
so-far spotty record of preventive strategies intended to keep
members well.
</P>
<P>
   They are combing their mountains of computerized information
looking for patterns in diseases like asthma and diabetes, that
could, in theory, be managed at lower cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a single database, we will be able to stratify our
membership and see who is going to get sick tomorrow,'' Huber said.
</P>
<P>
   One study showed that fewer than half of Aetna's members who had
suffered congestive heart failure were taking beta blocker drugs, a
recommended therapy. ``What can we do today to make sure that all
the preventive steps are being applied so they don't end up with
another heart attack and become an expensive hospital bed occupant
for us?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   But Aetna still has far to go to achieve a single database that
would join its own computer systems with those of Prudential and
NYLCare. Aetna has said it would not even complete the integration
of NYLCare into its operations until well into 2000. Meanwhile, the
company is spending heavily just to overcome computer glitches
associated with the changeover to 2000.
</P>
<P>
   And with so many managed-care companies pushing for more
preventive care and better management of diseases, quality of care
could also become a commodity that will be available from numerous
HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   Huber is well aware of the pressure to stay ahead of the crowd.
``Just give me two years' lead,'' he said.

DIGITAL COMMERCE: THE DAY-TRADER PHENOMENON 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Internet changes everything!'' has become the rallying cry
for purveyors of the new digital economy. Their enthusiasm has
proved sufficiently compelling that an increasing number of
Internet-based companies _ many with no product, no profits and,
often, no proven or sustainable business model _ are taking their
companies public and hitting the jackpot with shares that are
valued far beyond reason.
</P>
<P>
   On the Friday after Thanksgiving, for example, shares of Onsale
Inc., a Web-based auction service, rocketed more than 60 percent.
Books-a-Million Inc. and Connect Inc., both Web-based businesses,
posted even more spectacular gains.
</P>
<P>
   Most professional investors and market experts are not overly
concerned about this kind of activity. The volume of shares that
such companies make available for trading is relatively small and
thus has little effect on the overall health of the market. In
addition, they say, Internet stocks are widely, and correctly,
regarded as high-risk investments.
</P>
<P>
   But what was noteworthy about the trading action after
Thanksgiving was that it was caused by day traders _ primarily
individual investors, trading online _ who rely on quick market
fluctuations to turn a profit. And on the day after Thanksgiving,
these individuals dominated the trading volume in at least a few
high-technology growth stocks.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet changes everything, indeed. For the first time,
anyone with a computer, a connection to the global network and the
requisite ironclad stomach for risk has the information, tools and
access to transaction systems required to play the stock market, a
game that was once the purview of an elite few.
</P>
<P>
   For those who believe that this kind of decentralization of
power is the primary benefit of an Internet-based economy, this is
good news. But one has to wonder about the unintended consequences
of such a fundamental shift.
</P>
<P>
   Some studies show that the number of individuals jumping onto
the Internet increases by thousands every day; as technology
improves, that number is likely to rise even faster. Information _
especially the kind of information that fuels stock trading, like
real-time quotes and company data _ is on the verge of becoming
ubiquitous.
</P>
<P>
   Couple that with the likelihood that as more individuals make
money in a booming stock market, the word of mouth _ spread in chat
rooms and news groups via the Internet itself _ is likely to
attract still more day traders, and you end up with a model for
exponential growth.
</P>
<P>
   Some market makers, in fact, are already projecting that they
will have to double or triple their technology investments to keep
up with increased volume from Internet traders.
</P>
<P>
   Though he believes the volatility of Internet stocks is not
itself a problem, William Hambrecht, co-founder of the investment
banking firm Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, calls the day trader phenomenon ``a
big thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been amazed they've been able to have such an impact on
some of these big-cap Internet stocks,'' said Hambrecht, who now
runs W.R. Hambrecht &AMP; Co., an entrepreneurial investment firm.
``This isn't a few people with a few small stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   He calls the current day trader phenomenon ``mob rule,'' and
adds: ``In a free market, it plays itself out. Professionals are
trying to tell these people that they're playing with dangerous
stuff, but people don't listen when they're in a feeding frenzy.''
</P>
<P>
   Some investors are anticipating the near-term effects of day
trading on the Internet economy itself, which is fueled in large
part by the hefty prices commanded by Internet-related stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``These price effects have consequences,'' says Ann Winblad, a
co-founder of Hummer Winblad Venture Partners in San Francisco, a
technology investment firm. A prolonged run-up in stock prices, she
says, could prove to be a double whammy for Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Ms. Winblad said, it will become increasingly
difficult to hire talented managers if they believe the shares are
so overpriced that the stock options being offered them _ the
pheromone that draws most executives to technology companies _ are
likely to be considerably devalued when the market comes to its
senses. If the company then resets the options at a lower, more
attractive price, institutional investors, who hold most of the
market's stock and tend to invest in assets rather than concepts,
will balk.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it is only these institutional investors, as well as
program traders who move large blocks of stock in a single,
computer-guided transaction, who can affect the overall stability
of the larger market. But if individual trading on the Internet
continues to grow at its current pace, it is possible to imagine a
situation where the market as we know it today cannot absorb the
shock.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Schwartz, chairman of the Global Business Network, a
strategic planning firm in Emeryville, Calif., points to the fact
that people around the world have access to the stock market
through the Internet. What happens, he asks, when ``vast numbers of
people from all around the world _ 50 million people in India, 5
million in Brazil _ are all trading?''
</P>
<P>
   If the number of individual investors grows large enough to
match the volume of shares held by institutional investors and
program traders, Schwartz says, ``when herd behavior moves the
larger market in these highly volatile ways, unrelated to the value
of the assets themselves, that becomes highly problematic.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there is no way to predict whether such a situation
will unfold. Even if it does, Schwartz said, it will be a long time
coming.
</P>
<P>
   But in the short term, the problem may solve itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too many people have the stomach'' for day trading, Ms.
Winblad said. ``The viral effect will eventually settle. Some
industries are maimed, but they don't go away.''

   NEW ORLEANS _ The conference room in the Sheraton New Orleans
hotel was quiet, save for the shoo-shoo-shoo deep-breathing sounds
coming from the 80 men and women in nametags silently circling the
room. After a minute, the seminar leader held up her hand to halt
the mute crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, strike the pose of a hero,'' she instructed. ``Strike the
statue of the gods and goddesses that you are!'' She asked the
group to cry out words they felt when they thought of themselves as
heroes. There was palpable hesitation, then a human-resources
executive from Wells Fargo, a string of pearls around her neck,
lifted her arms in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a thunderbolt!'' she shouted. A man in a Hawaiian-print
shirt exclaimed ``Hallelujah!'' as he posed, one arm extended
behind him as if he were preparing to toss a discus. A
computer-company executive in high heels put her hands defiantly on
her hips and cried, hesitantly: ``You, you _ you fabulous goddess
you!''
</P>
<P>
   If it sounds like an EST seminar or some sort of Tony Robbins
inspirational jamboree, it wasn't. It was, in fact, one of several
instructional sessions offered at a conference _ actually, the
organizers prefer the term ``gathering'' _ hosted this month by
Fast Company, a technology-oriented business magazine targeted to
young entrepreneurs. A feel-good business bible for the generation
that never leaves home without a Palm Pilot, Fast Company is
published by Mortimer Zuckerman.
</P>
<P>
   Fast Company attracted four hundred people to this, its second
``Real Time'' conference. And while Fast Company may be the only
magazine to host a conference at which the former secretary of
labor, Robert Reich, led an audience of hundreds in an impromptu
kazoo concert, it is not alone in its mission. In an attempt to
solidify the relationship with readers _ and their checkbooks _
publishers have begun to organize events for subscribers and
readers beyond the pages of their magazines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simply selling a magazine is just not enough anymore,'' said
Alan Webber, one of Fast Company's two founding editors. In
addition to the Real Time conferences, the 3-year-old magazine
encourages readers to form discussion groups, a network of 9,300
readers the editors call the ``Company of Friends.''
</P>
<P>
   The principle of bringing readers in other than through the
pages of the magazine is also at work at other media companies. Jay
MacDonald, chief executive of MacDonald Communications, a New York
media company that owns Working Woman and Working Mother magazines,
has founded four annual conferences _ not only as an instrument
with which to extend the brand identities of his two magazines, but
as profit-making ventures _ in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes magazine founded the Forbes Management Conference Group
in 1995. McGraw-Hill's Business Week plays host to eight to 12
conferences a year. And Time Warner's Fortune employs a staff of 20
simply for its conference activity.
</P>
<P>
   Fast Company's Webber _ who is fond of saying, ``Remember, it's
not a magazine, it's a movement'' _ is a trim 50-year-old who,
along with William Taylor, grew tired of his work as an editor at
The Harvard Business Review four years ago. Together, they created
a 103-page prototype and, ``after a year of wandering the canyons
of Manhattan,'' said Taylor, sold a majority stake in the business
to Zuckerman.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor added that Zuckerman's leadership had been strictly
hands-off _ a contrast to what may politely be described as his
usual, hands-on dedication to his other properties like The Daily
News of New York and U.S. News &AMP; World Report.
</P>
<P>
   Fast Company isn't your parents' business magazine. It styles
itself as a guidebook for the ambitious yet sensitive young
businessperson facing a swiftly changing and increasingly ruthless
economy. The magazine's goal: to encourage readers to think in
contrarian terms about the business world, with stories like
``Money! Power! Fame! (And Other Ways to Self-Destruct)'' and
``Green is Good,'' an article about ecological mindfulness in the
corporate world. The magazine's conference _ while light on hard
information and heavy on motivational speakers _ is in essence Fast
Company's version of a three-day MBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frequently, business magazines have conferences because you're
able to actually have a focus and a theme and a practical
outcome,'' Webber said. ``But one of the things that's different
with ours is that we view our gatherings as a part of the editorial
product. Other magazines have separate conference arms that are
hived off from the editorial group.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the conference here, it's also a chance for people
working in technology to work on their people skills. Michael Gort,
an information technology consultant from Old Greenwich, Conn.,
pointed out that working in software, for example, can be lonely.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can get alienated in this field,'' he said. ``You can now
have an entire product team that develops a product without ever
meeting each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Kalish, president of a software design company in Orem,
Utah, said that he read Fast Company because no other business
magazine focused on issues with the same ``human touch.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The business press doesn't address your feelings, your
insecurities,'' he added. ``The first time I saw Fast Company, I
saw that they did. And there's a lot of fear out there. We all need
to address that.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, who is 40, said that kind of feedback keeps Fast Company
singularly in touch with its readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We convene this two-day conversation about where our readers
are at, what are they dreaming about and scheming about, what are
they worrying about,'' Taylor said.``I walk around with a much more
visceral appreciation for the kinds of themes and article and
vocabulary words that are going to teach our readers.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The first Real Time conference attracted more than 400 readers
who attended the conference here, paying $1,500 each. The three-day
event began on the evening of Dec. 6 with a ``knowledge hunt'' _ a
grown-up version of a scavenger hunt that required participants to
play Pictionary on the sidewalk of Bourbon Street _ and included
sessions with titles like ``Group Grope,'' ``Climbing Your Own
Everest,'' ``Here's What Imagination Sounds Like,'' and a seminar
by a dance troupe about how to ``out-dance the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The attendees all radiated a caffeinated, hopeful enthusiasm,
and having paid their admission fees and flown from California,
Utah, Minnesota and Maine, clearly took Real Time seriously. One
man, pausing for a skim latte at a neighborhood Starbucks, even
called it a religious experience.
</P>
<P>
   Reich delivered the first lecture of the conference, and after a
few jokes _ ``As you can see, four years in the president's cabinet
wore me down,'' Reich, who is not a tall man, said. ``I used to be
6 feet 2 inches!'' _ spoke seriously about the challenge of the
global economy, the advent of Euromoney, and his fears about the
Year 2000 computer problem.
</P>
<P>
   At times the proceedings bordered on the surreal _ Reich's
lengthy speech about how his artificial hips were actually an
allegory for global trade (they were designed in France, produced
in Germany and implanted in the United States), for example, or the
scene of hundreds of otherwise professional-looking conference
attendees drinking Hurricanes (a New Orleans rum specialty) and
gyrating to ``The Mardi Gras Mambo'' at Tip's Big Room. But it
didn't seem to matter to the Fast Company editors.
</P>
<P>
   After three years, the magazine _ which was introduced with the
publication of 100,000 copies _ will guarantee a rate base of
305,000 in January. Its ad sales appear robust. In 1996, the first
year of publication, 394 ad pages brought in $3,031,280 in revenue,
according to the Publishers Information Bureau. In 1997, ad pages
almost doubled to 696, resulting in $7,095,578 in revenue. With
this year's August issue, the magazine switched from bi-monthly
publication to monthly.
</P>
<P>
   And for 1998, Julian Lowin, publisher of Fast Company, said he
expected to see $15 million in ad revenue. The Publishers
Information Bureau figure for January to October 1998 is
$10,983,320, but Lowin said the last three months of the year would
not only be monthly, but particularly rich with ads.
</P>
<P>
   After the conference, Webber and Taylor returned to their
offices in Boston. (Their staff in New York works in the same
building on West 33rd Street as The Daily News.) Taylor said he had
gleaned several ideas for stories from the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, Fast Company is not The New Yorker,'' he said, his
voice hoarse from days of nonstop networking. ``We're not editors
who can go off into a cave and think deep thoughts and come out
with a profound message. We need to be out there, with our readers,
talking to them, understanding them.''
</P>
<P>
   And Webber said he didn't mind the conference's occasionally
warm-and-fuzzy bent or its effect on the gravity with which readers
or advertisers perceive Fast Company.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old world of business and management, it was all about
`Check your emotions at the door, check your individuality at the
door,''' he said. ``It was the world of the organization man. The
new world is `Bring it all in.' Be your own individual. If you're
interested in zydeco, and you work at a software company, maybe
there's a way to integrate zydeco into a new software design.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Zuckerman, he wasn't particularly interested in zydeco
software. ``I'm just happy to be a passenger on their train,'' he
said.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Why is BellSouth Corp. talking up its stock?
</P>
<P>
   That question has been percolating on Wall Street and in the
telecommunications industry all fall. And while the speculation is
nowhere near a boil, it is clear that BellSouth has become more
aggressive in promoting its stock than it has been at any time at
least since passage of the Telecommunications Act of 1996.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing necessarily untoward about a company of
BellSouth's caliber encouraging people to buy its shares _ or
encouraging analysts who work for brokerage houses to raise their
estimates for the company's performance, which is functionally the
same thing. But in an industry where multibillion-dollar
acquisitions have become almost commonplace, a company in
BellSouth's so-far nonacquisitive position is bound to raise
eyebrows by flogging its shares. Stock, after all, is the currency
of most communications deals.
</P>
<P>
   The brows were set in motion in October at a meeting with
investors and analysts at the Intercontinental Hotel in Manhattan.
There, the company's top executives said that many analyst
estimates for BellSouth's earnings growth were too conservative and
encouraged stronger projections for next year. Around the same
time, representatives of the company telephoned at least one
reporter to point out how well BellSouth's stock was performing.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing unusual about a company loudly promoting its
prospects _ unless the company is BellSouth. After all, higher
expectations only make it easier to fail, and BellSouth's
time-honored reputation has been to avoid the high wire.
``BellSouth is a very conservative organization,'' said one Wall
Street executive who follows the Atlanta-based company.
``Traditionally, they have not been this promotional.''
</P>
<P>
   Late last month, in a single day, the company announced three
moves _ each of which could be expected to nudge up its stock price
and did so. It said it would split its shares two for one, raise
the dividend by 5.5 percent and buy back as much as $3 billion
worth of its stock.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in early December, before another lunch with
analysts, this one at the Waldorf-Astoria, Ronald Dykes,
BellSouth's chief financial officer, did not disagree that his
company had become more aggressive in discussing its stock. But he
made it clear that the cheerleading effort had been under way for
more than two months. ``This started at our annual meeting in
April,'' he said. ``But the guidance didn't take.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in April that the company raised its ``guidance'' for
analysts on its expected per-share earnings growth from ``low
double digits'' _ or 10 to 12 percent, in finance-speak _ to
``mid-teens,'' which basically means 15 percent. But not all the
analysts followed its lead by raising their growth estimates, which
compare 1998 data with forecasts for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   As Dykes told the analysts and investors at the Waldorf lunch,
to a general chuckle, ``It took a few folks a few quarters to
figure out what `mid-teens' meant.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, though, all of this ``guidance'' achieved the
desired result.
</P>
<P>
   From Jan. 1 until BellSouth's annual meeting on April 27, its
stock gained 12.4 percent. That placed it second behind GTE Corp.,
at 13.5 percent, among the six local telephone giants, and just
ahead of US West, at 11.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But for the entire year so far, BellSouth's shares have
performed far better than the stocks of any of the other companies
in the segment. BellSouth's stock appreciation of 55.5 percent
through last Friday outdistanced each of the other five by at least
16 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   But talk, even from a company as traditionally reticent as
BellSouth, remains cheap. The strong performance of BellSouth's
stock is grounded in one of the most respected telecommunications
management teams in the nation. That team, led by F. Duane
Ackerman, has done a good job of controlling costs and generating
new revenue from existing customers, even while investing billions
of dollars in growth markets in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   For all that, though, why does BellSouth's stock merit a
multiple of projected 1999 earnings of 27, when the rest of the
group is bunched between 20.2 (Bell Atlantic) and 24.4 (Ameritech)?
</P>
<P>
   One reason could be that, unlike four of its brethren, BellSouth
is not now betting on the successful execution of a
multibillion-dollar merger. The conventional wisdom, of course, is
that with the industry consolidating all around it, BellSouth can't
continue to go it alone forever.
</P>
<P>
   That remains to be seen. But some analysts think BellSouth is
getting set to use its elevated shares to make a bid for a new
long-distance phone company. Those mentioned include IXC
Communications and Williams Communications _ now that Williams
Cos., the parent of Williams, has agreed to issue a separate stock
for the long-distance business. Other analysts, though, say that no
BellSouth purchase seems imminent.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Dykes would say only that within the United
States, acquiring new lines of business seemed preferable to
building them. In his presentation at the subsequent lunch,
however, he did not shy from flashing the company's wallet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of cash,'' he said. ``We are underleveraged. And
we have the strongest currency in the business.''

`THE GREATEST GENERATION': THEY MADE MISTAKES, BUT THEY SAVED THE
WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(lb) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Up to a point, you can sympathize with what Tom Brokaw is saying
in ``The Greatest Generation'': that the American men and women who
were born around 1920, who came of age in the Great Depression, who
fought in World War II and who rebuilt the postwar world and passed
the results on to succeeding generations, were extraordinary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a generation,'' Brokaw writes, ``that, by and large,
made no demands of homage from those who followed and prospered
economically, politically and culturally because of its
sacrifices.'' He continues, ``It is a generation of towering
achievement and modest demeanor, a legacy of their formative years
when they were participants in and witness to sacrifices of the
highest order.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a generation, he argues, that makes you think of all those
words that Hemingway once said you couldn't use anymore: duty,
honor, country, flag, family, church, faith, loyalty,
self-sacrifice, purpose, modesty, responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the generation made mistakes, Brokaw admits: racism, sex
discrimination, anti-communist hysteria, Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Or as he puts it, somewhat cloudily: ``They allowed McCarthyism
and racism to go unchallenged for too long. Women of the World War
II generation, who had demonstrated so convincingly that they had
so much more to offer beyond their traditional work, were the
underpinning for the liberation of their gender, even as many of
their husbands resisted the idea. When a new war broke out, many of
the veterans initially failed to recognize the difference between
their war and the one in Vietnam.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he concludes, ``This is the greatest generation any
society has produced.''
</P>
<P>
   Brokaw's motives in writing the book seem heartfelt. Walking the
beaches in Normandy in 1984 with American veterans while preparing
an NBC television documentary on the 40th anniversary of D-Day, he
``underwent a life-changing experience,'' he reports.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was deeply moved and profoundly grateful for all they had
done. I realized that they had been all around me as I was growing
up and that I had failed to appreciate what they had been though
and what they had accomplished.'' So his book is a tribute to his
parents and their friends, as well as to their conduct.
</P>
<P>
   And the stories he tells of them are diverting enough,
occasionally even inspiring. Chronicling some 50 lives, he offers
examples of the many virtues he is celebrating: people who
distinguished themselves both in battle and on the home front, men
who built careers despite being disabled by the war, women who
overcame the obstacles that were stacked against them, minorities
who used adversity to improve their people's lives.
</P>
<P>
   Some are individuals whom Brokaw met while researching D-Day.
Others he came to know while growing up in South Dakota. Some are
obscure and consider their achievements ordinary. Others were
vaulted to fame by their wartime experiences: George Bush, Ben
Bradlee, Bob Dole, Caspar Weinberger, among others.
</P>
<P>
   All stand as a rebuke to certain excesses in the contemporary
culture: the desire to place one's own interests first, the habit
of regarding the truth as the most recent words to pass one's
teeth, the refusal to take responsibility for one's behavior, the
tendency to view the births of one's children as random events to
which one has little connection, the inclination to measure one's
worth by how much money one has. In short, almost everything
exemplified these days by many professional athletes, a few
talk-show hosts and a certain president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But enough is as good as a feast, and what Brokaw offers here is
far more than enough. Three stories would suffice to make his
point; 50 are a surfeit causing the eyes to glaze over, especially
when they repeat one another's point and lack sharp individual
focus.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are they particularly well told, rambling as they are and
replete with cliches. (The three times the word ``seminal'' is
used, it refers to a woman's work, as in ``Betty Friedan's seminal
book on the place of modern women, `The Feminine Mystique.''') Such
is the predictability of Brokaw's prose that you can read every
fourth sentence of it and get the idea.
</P>
<P>
   This is too bad, because the question of why patriotism waxes
and wanes during a nation's history is a significant one worth
deeper exploration than Brokaw has given it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Among the many people he talked with, only Andy Rooney
challenged his thesis that the generation in question was a
superior one, arguing, as Brokaw puts it, that ``the character of
the current generation is just as strong; it's just that his
generation had a Depression, World War II and a Cold War against
which to test their character.''
</P>
<P>
   The story that ``The Greatest Generation'' tells too repeatedly
makes you suspect that Rooney is right: First came the challenges,
then the heroic responses. Equally you suspect that somewhere in
the United States today are people facing challenges nearly as
daunting as Brokaw's wartime generation did _ challenges of
poverty, of prejudice, of cultural displacement _ and facing them
as heroically as Brokaw's subjects did.
</P>
<P>
   They may not represent an entire generation, but they will be
heard from somewhere down the road. Dare one hope in these feckless
times that they may someday be in charge of the show?

<P>
   The latest two premieres for the Alvin Ailey American Dance
Theater's season are by dancers in the company. Both pieces were
introduced at City Center on Friday night, and both were intense in
different ways. Each suggested its novice choreographer should be
given further opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Restricted,'' Lisa Johnson was obviously telling some sort
of story whose plot line had been abstracted into powerful images.
The work had its sketchy aspects simply because specific dramatic
ideas were evoked but not developed, and yet the use of energy had
an unmistakable emotional impact.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, the choreographer's program dedication, ``In
memory of Roxanne Eley,'' is relevant to the work. Asked after the
premiere to identify Ms. Eley, a company spokesman said that she
was Ms. Johnson's cousin, and that both women had grown up together
in Washington. When Ms. Eley was raped and murdered there in 1996,
it was because she was a lesbian, Ms. Johnson said. She said the
title ``Restricted'' refers to the kind of life her cousin led.
</P>
<P>
   Like this viewer, most in the audience were presumably unaware
of this background before seeing the piece, and it would be wrong
to consider it as a literal retelling of Ms. Johnson's family
tragedy. In generalized terms, the work seems to be about people
breaking free to express a sexual identity.
</P>
<P>
   Initially tied together by a symbolic rope, the four members of
the cast divide into a male-female couple and a female pair.
Choices seem to be made here about partners in dance and in life;
yet there is also a hint of confusion when, at the end, the man and
one of the women from the female pair make contact. Ms. Johnson's
strong suit is atmosphere. Although not always clear, she succeeds
in conveying a troubled emotional resonance.
</P>
<P>
   The symbolic long yellow rope in which Renee Robinson, Venus
Hall, Christina Angela Gonzales and Vernard Gilmore are entangled
does not restrict them for long. Stacey Saltzman's silvery costumes
give the dancers a starlike luster as they revolve and break loose
to flail, kick and plunge into short phrases of movement with
choppy gestures and asymmetrical shapes (knee up to one side).
</P>
<P>
   Influenced perhaps by Ulysses Dove's pieces in the repertory,
Ms. Johnson avoids a fluid ``dancey'' phrase, and like Dove she
chooses music (by Michael Mays) that is ruled by a big beat, a
piston-driving sound. The images have their mysteries: Two women
pass through a hoop formed by Gilmore's arms. In a solo, Gilmore
hits his chin with clasped hands.
</P>
<P>
   As Ms. Robinson and Ms. Hall revolve in an embrace, Ms. Gonzales
lies entwined in the rope, before a duet with Gilmore finds her
lying horizontally across the back of his neck and shoulders. The
dancers are splendid and Pamela Hobson's lighting, defining
rectangles as restrictive spaces, adds extra symbolism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ascension,'' the second premiere, is dedicated by the
choreographer, Troy O'Neil Powell, as follows: ``To Mom, one of the
most compassionate people I have ever known _ rest in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Like his dancing, O'Neil's choreography has a muscular wit. The
piece offers a punch line, but its winning grace is an overall
polish. The audience, this time, even broke out into wolf whistles
when the curtain went up on Matthew Rushing, Jeffrey Gerodias and
Glenn Sims in bathing suits and swim caps. Barbara Forbes'
costumes, for one thing, are in gorgeous green, turquoise and
purple. Brenda Dolan's lighting aptly gives the beach boy trio a
golden glow.
</P>
<P>
   As at the start, the men occasionally face the rear. But usually
they soar through space with athletic grace or push against an
invisible resisting force that gives the movement, for all its
exuberance, an exciting tension. Balletic leaps in a circle and
high leg extensions are coherently joined with more spontaneous
movement (a wiggle, shoulder rotation and beefcake pose); the solos
have punchier movement after Desiree Vlad, strutting like a true
femme fatale, enters along a diagonal.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Wimberly's music, prone to big beats, picks up a richer
texture here with light percussion; Ms. Vlad gets passed around and
at the end the men toss her into the wings and out of their club.
Draw your own conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Ailey's ``Revelations,'' also on the program, continues to be
danced wonderfully this season. Uri Sands' fluidity of movement
needs special mention; it was stunning on Wednesday when he and Ms.
Robinson gave something extra to the image of born-again baptism in
the ``Wade in the Water'' duet, which was rendered dramatically on
Friday by Dwana Adiaha Smallwood and Bernard Gaddis.
</P>
<P>
   That evening was dedicated to Meg Gordean, who has just left the
company after 29 years as its publicity agent.

`INSIDE SCIENTOLOGY': SHOWS ZEAL OF BOTH SIDES  
 `NYTV': BASKING IN THE GLOW OF DISTANT MEMORIES

<P>
   Is Scientology a religion or a cult, and is there a difference?
Are its disciples being helped to live happier, more rewarding
lives, or are they being exploited? Is the organization out for
power and wealth, or is it doing good works by contributing to drug
and literacy programs? Is it the victim of persecution, or does it
persecute its critics?
</P>
<P>
   Such are the main issues that have roiled around the contentious
Church of Scientology, described somewhat ornately Monday night by
Bill Kurtis as seeking a place ``on the map of global emerging
philosophies,'' since its beginnings a half century ago.
</P>
<P>
   The first hour is given to the shadowy, some say shady career of
the movement's founder, L. Ron Hubbard, the science-fiction writer
who discovered or invented or conjured up the principles and
tactics, which he labeled ``Dianetics,'' and which have attracted
hundreds of thousands of followers. The group's methods of
operation, especially its aggressive treatment of those it deems
insufficiently friendly have attracted the generally unfriendly
attentions of the law and the media.
</P>
<P>
   The second hour pits disaffected Scientologists, who charge the
organization with thought-control tactics, against its acolytes,
who tell how their lives were enriched by techniques that they say
clear them of bad thoughts and attitudes. Testimonials come from
celebrity members like Isaac Hayes (``I felt great'') and John
Travolta, who reports that he has found in Hubbard's teachings the
answers to criminality, war and insanity.
</P>
<P>
   David Miscavige, the current leader of the organization, says
that Scientology is ``the place where science and religion have
truly met.'' Nothing heard is likely to persuade you of that or of
much else about the efficacy of its therapeutic approach, much less
its spiritual provenance. But at the least, you may come away with
an appreciation of the zeal that is still being churned up over the
church or the cult, both among those who worship there and those
who preach against it.  &QL;

   `NYTV': BASKING IN THE GLOW OF DISTANT MEMORIES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reality cannot match the glow of memory in Monday night's fond
reminiscences of the early years of television making in New York.
But for viewers of the right age, the anecdotes and clips should be
warming. ``NYTV'' brings back many of the people who did the
making, along with glimpses of ``Howdy Doody'' and ``Marty,''
Milton Berle and Bishop Fulton Sheen, quiz shows and talk shows and
soaps and wrestling and much else that hooked the first set owners
when television was still figuring out what it was supposed to be
about.
</P>
<P>
   Al Roker links the vintage favorites with a quick history of the
medium, including dark periods like the McCarthy-era blacklists and
the quiz show scandals. But these two hours are mostly cheery as
they celebrate the New York creative spirit, which at least in
these recollections was free and daring, with innovators like Fred
Coe and Pat Weaver encouraging writers like Rod Serling and
geniuses like Sid Caesar to go for it.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the veterans lament that things have only gotten worse,
especially since most television producing moved West. Could the
New York era have been as much fun as the participants recall or as
good as they tell us? Well, we were all a lot younger.  &QL;

   Low clouds and patchy light rain or drizzle will persist over
much of the Tennessee Valley and Southeast coast where moist
breezes from the Northeast prevail. Winds will be gusty at times
near the Carolina and Georgia coasts as low pressure lingers
offshore. Clouds will begin to break later Monday over the western
Tennessee and southern Mississippi Valleys as drier winds from the
north develop.
</P>
<P>
   Gusty winds from the Northwest will gradually subside from the
New England to the Middle Atlantic coast as high pressure moves
east from the Ohio Valley. Clouds and a few flurries will occur
over the mountains of northern New England, especially Monday
morning. Otherwise, plenty of sunshine and near seasonal
temperatures will prevail in most of the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Unseasonably mild air will surge from the Plains into the
western Great Lakes. Afternoon temperatures will average 10 to 20
degrees above normal over a large area from the east slopes of the
northern Rockies to the northern Mississippi Valley. Sunshine will
be abundant in most areas.
</P>
<P>
   Seasonably cold air will arrive over the interior West on gusty
winds from the Northwest. Intermittent snow will fall along
west-facing slopes of the northern and central Rockies. A potent
jet stream disturbance with limited moisture will bring scattered
snow to northern Nevada and Utah.
</P>
<P>
   The West Coast states will be mainly dry as high pressure
strengthens over Oregon. Strong winds will develop across
California, especially near the mountain passes.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Wettest Year
</P>
<P>
   Despite a worsening drought due to a parched autumn in parts of
the interior Northeast, a new annual precipitation record was set
at Burlington, Vt., this weekend. A few showers on Friday pushed
the 1998 total to 50.18 inches of rain and melted snow, eclipsing
the previous record set in 1983. The annual average is only 34.47
inches. The year began with a devastating ice storm that helped
lead to Burlington's wettest January on record. Frequent downpours
continued during the warm season, contributing to the lakeside
city's wettest July as well as its wettest summer on record.

   MIDEAST-CLINTON (Jerusalem) _ Combative and stone-faced,

   DIABETES-CHILDREN (New York) _ A look at an alarming new health
trend: the sharp increase in the number of youngsters with Type 2
diabetes, also known as adult-onset diabetes, an incurable and
progressively damaging disease that can cause kidney failure,
blindness and poor circulation, which, in turn, can lead to
amputation. Doctors long believed the disease occurred only during
middle age or later. Although there have not been any national
surveys documenting the rise of this form of diabetes in children,
several small-scale studies have found that such cases have more
than tripled in the last five years.

   IMPEACH (Washington) _ With the full House returning for a vote
on impeachment this week, President Clinton on Sunday rebuffed
Republican calls for him to admit to lying under oath and said
flatly that he had not committed perjury. He deflected calls for
him to step down. ``I have no intention of resigning,'' he said.
``It's never crossed my mind.'' Unable to escape the constitutional
crisis engulfing his presidency, the president fielded questions
about his fate in Jerusalem, where he had flown to try to revive
the Middle East peace process. Back home, leading Republicans said
he could save the nation from an impeachment trial by stepping
down.

   IMPEACH-REPUBS (Washington) _ In a surprising shift of political
calculations, many prominent Republicans now say that the party's

NO DANCING TEAPOTS IN `PRINCE OF EGYPT' 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Jeffrey Katzenberg was talking about the film that
has consumed him for nearly five years. ``You can't do in `Prince
of Egypt' what you did in `Little Mermaid' and `Beauty and the
Beast,''' said Katzenberg, referring to two of the animated hits
that stamped his career as president of Walt Disney Studios.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no dancing teapots here, no cute little cuddly
animals or outrageous sidekicks,'' he said. ``There are no cheerful
musical respites. This is not a cartoon. Nobody does those movies
better than Disney. Had we tried, the best we could have done would
have been Avis to their Hertz. So why try?''
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg, long departed from Disney in a hugely bitter divorce
and now a co-owner of Dreamworks, made his comments early the other
morning at a coffee shop in a Pasadena hotel before talking up
``Prince'' with reporters for religious publications.
</P>
<P>
   Opening on Friday, ``The Prince of Egypt,'' a $75 million (and
that may be a low figure) animated version of the biblical saga of
Moses, has been lavishly promoted and widely anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is ``The Prince of Egypt'' a significant animated
undertaking, but the film is viewed by agents, producers and rival
studio executives as a test of how Katzenberg would pursue
animation on his own after shepherding its revival at the
traditional center of gravity, Disney.
</P>
<P>
   What makes Dreamworks executives nervous _ and what fascinates
rivals at Disney and the rest of Hollywood _ is that Katzenberg has
helped shape a somber musical saga designed for adults and children
who are not toddlers.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond this, Katzenberg said, perhaps grandiosely, that he had
sought to put animation to different uses and make a film that
borrows far less from Disney and its cartoon tradition and far more
from David Lean's ``Lawrence of Arabia,'' and even, in some ways,
from the French impressionist Claude Monet and from the biblical
etchings of the 19th-century illustrator Gustave Dore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's too extreme, maybe we've gone too far, maybe the
big idea doesn't work,'' said a nervous Katzenberg, a founder of
Dreamworks with Steven Spielberg and David Geffen, describing the
film that is certainly the biggest risk of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Preparing for the film, Katzenberg and his team of artists and
animators visited Egypt and the Sinai Peninsula and then sought to
create an animated style that, they hoped, differed from Disney's.
Faces were elongated to make them more realistic and expressive.
</P>
<P>
   As in any animated film, extraordinary attention was paid to the
movie's palette. But the contrasts in ``The Prince of Egypt'' are
striking. The pharaoh's palace is splendid and chilly, all white
and light pastels, in contrast to the warm, burnished colors of the
modest dwellings of the Israelites in Goshen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world of the Hebrews is more organic,'' Richie Chavez, the
film's art director, said in the movie's production notes. ``We
gave Goshen more of a rounded, eroded look because the homes were
made of mud brick, which is weathered by the rain, the wind and the
sand. The homes are asymmetrical and out of kilter to give them a
flow and ebb that the angular Egyptian side doesn't have.'' The
faces of the Egyptian characters are more sculptured in appearance,
with chiseled features; the Israelites are more curved and their
shapes are looser.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg said that animators and artists on the film had seen
``Lawrence of Arabia'' (1962) numerous times, but that he had asked
them not to see Cecil B. DeMille's ``Ten Commandments'' (1956). ``I
didn't want them intimidated, because the images in that film are
so powerful and so strong,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg has already consulted about 700 Bible scholars,
Egyptologists, divinity school teachers and religious leaders
including the conservatives Jerry Falwell and Pat Robertson. They
were consulted on everything from the costumes to the compression
of the story into 90 minutes to making sure the Bible tale was
being retold in a way that would not offend Christians, Muslims or
Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Although Wal-Mart is promoting the film in its stores,
Dreamworks has decided against arranging fast-food tie-ins and toy
spinoffs, in deference to the subject matter. So far, Wal-Mart has
sold 600,000 advance tickets to the film.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to be uncompromising here _ there's nothing cute and
adorable in the film,'' Katzenberg said. ``In other words, we
didn't make the camel funny. You know how easy it is to make a
camel funny? Trust me, there's no animal on this planet that's
funnier than a camel. We thought of it. We dropped it.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On a personal level, Katzenberg is plainly seeking to prove two
things to his former boss, Michael Eisner, chairman of Walt Disney.
One is that the company's huge success in animation with films like
``The Little Mermaid,'' ``Beauty and the Beast,'' ``Aladdin'' and
``The Lion King'' was largely due to him.
</P>
<P>
   The second is that he could take animation to a new level.
(Disney remains, of course, the dominant studio for animation, and
its most recent film, ``A Bug's Life,'' made with Pixar, is one of
the year's biggest successes.)
</P>
<P>
   Eisner refused to promote Katzenberg from his studio chief's job
to the president of the company in 1994, forcing him to leave. In a
contentious legal battle, Katzenberg sued Disney and said he was
owed 2 percent of the profit, or about $250 million, from the
projects he oversaw in his decade at the company. Both sides said
the lawsuit had been settled, but the financial details are still
unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg said he had ``a fantastic partnership for 19 years''
with Eisner. He added, ``He clearly brought out the best in me, and
I like to think I was a pretty good partner to him.'' The
departure, he insisted, was actually a blessing in disguise. ``The
great fortune for me is I moved on to something better,''
Katzenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Katzenberg said he had not read Eisner's recently published
memoir, ``Work in Progress'' (Random House), written with Tony
Schwartz. In the book, Eisner said that Katzenberg was overly
aggressive and not especially suitable to hold the No. 2 job at the
corporation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Prince of Egypt,'' with original songs by Stephen Schwartz
and music composed by Hans Zimmer, has an unusual top-tier cast of
actors speaking the animated roles: Val Kilmer (Moses), Ralph
Fiennes (Rameses), Michelle Pfeiffer (Tzipporah, who becomes the
wife of Moses), Danny Glover (Jethro), Sandra Bullock (Miriam),
Helen Mirren (the Queen).
</P>
<P>
   Though its cost has been estimated to be at least $75 million,
computing how much is actually spent on an animated movie is often
difficult. Both Katzenberg and Dreamworks have an enormous stake in
``The Prince of Egypt,'' partly because of the film's risks and
cost but also because its release is probably more anticipated than
even that of the Dreamworks drama ``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   Dreamworks has already created a substantial animation division;
its next major animated movie, to be released in two years, is
``The Road to El Dorado,'' a comedy-adventure in the style of
``Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the early reviews of ``The Prince of Egypt'' in
magazines and trade papers have been good. ``Reviews are very
important, and not necessarily for lavishing praise but also to
inform an audience that, whatever the film's imperfections, hey,
there's something new out there for you,'' Katzenberg said.

   NEW YORK _ It might have seemed unimaginable five years ago that
a Spanish-language radio station would dominate the metropolitan
New York market. But since last summer, WSKQ-FM, which promotes
itself as Mega 97.9, has been No. 1, surpassing the market's
longtime leader, the light-rock station WLTW-FM.
</P>
<P>
   Offering a combination of salsa and merengue music aimed at
listeners 18 to 34 years old, the Mega 97.9 has seen its ratings
grow even since the the death in February of Junior Hernandez, its
popular morning host.
</P>
<P>
   The success of the station, one of a dozen around the nation
owned by Spanish Broadcasting System Inc., is testimony to the
power of the expanding Spanish-speaking audience at a time when
English-language radio formats are increasingly fragmented. Spanish
is now the primary language of 10 percent of the U.S. population;
in metropolitan New York the figure is 30 percent and growing.
</P>
<P>
   And compared with 1993, when there were 365 Spanish stations in
the United States, there are now 454 stations around the country
broadcasting full time in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   The extended reach of Spanish radio has helped its share of the
nation's total listening audience grow to 6.5 percent, from 5
percent three years ago, according to Robin Flynn, a radio analyst
at the media consulting firm Paul Kagan Associates.
</P>
<P>
   Riding this demographic and cultural wave are Raul Alarcon and
his son, Raul Alarcon Jr., owners of Mega 97.9 and Spanish
Broadcasting _ a company that is second only to Heftel Broadcasting
Corp. in terms of number of Spanish stations owned.
</P>
<P>
   A Cuban refugee, the senior Alarcon, 70, began his career in
this country in 1960 as a disk jockey at WBNX-AM, a
Spanish-language station in the Bronx. In 1983, he bought his first
station, WVNJ-AM in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, as he and his 42-year-old son have built their
portfolio of a dozen stations, they have not hesitated to acquire
and convert English-language stations to their style of radio, as
when they bought WSKQ in New York from The Jewish Daily Forward
newspaper and reformatted it as Mega 97.9.
</P>
<P>
   And the company's acquisitions are apparently far from over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am continuing to buy stations,'' the younger Alarcon said
recently in an interview at Spanish Broadcasting's headquarters in
Miami. ``We have built up a tremendous amount of equity.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Spanish Broadcasting is privately owned, it releases
financial data because it has issued publicly held bonds. The
company has yet to post year-end figures for the fiscal year that
ended Sept. 30, but Alarcon said sales were $85 million, up 27
percent from $66.7 million a year earlier, and operating profits
rose 16 percent, to $39 million.
</P>
<P>
   On the strength of such performance, the family is studying the
possibility of spinning off an equity stake in the company, noting
the success of CBS Corp.'s sale of a portion of its Infinity
Broadcasting radio unit. The Infinity stock was offered at $20.50 a
share last week and closed at $23.3125 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   For all the market momentum, though, Spanish Broadcasting faces
some challenges _ not the least of which is greater competition. In
Los Angeles, where the company owns two stations, it now has three
Spanish-language competitors, compared with only one several years
ago. Partly as a result, the company's Los Angeles flagship, KLAX,
which was that market's overall ratings leader as recently as 1994,
now ranks 11th.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the continued stigma that Spanish-language
stations face with advertisers, which still tend to favor a more
mainstream audience.
</P>
<P>
   Current ad revenue figures are not available, but last year,
when Mega 97.9 ranked third in the New York market in ratings, it
was only 13th in revenue, with $21.5 million. That was well back of
the top-ranked WLTW, or Lite-FM, which took in $38 million from
advertisers, according to James Duncan Jr., editor of Duncan's
Radio Market Guide.
</P>
<P>
   But a notorious attempt to exploit this cultural divide last
spring may have had the unintended consequence of rallying more
advertisers to the Hispanic cause. In May an internal memo at
Amcast, a division of Katz Radio Group that sells national
advertising for two English-language New York stations, advised its
advertising representatives to discourage potential clients from
buying ads on primarily black or Hispanic stations, stating,
``Advertisers should want prospects, not suspects.'' After the memo
was circulated in the industry, Katz issued an apology.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, said Cary Davis, general manager of Mega 97.9, some
new advertisers, including General Motors Corp.'s Cadillac division
and the NBC television network, have signed up with the station.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish Broadcasting's other main challenge is its heavy debt
load. To avoid bankruptcy in the early 1990s, the company issued
$175 million in high-yield debt and another $175 million in a
privately placed issue of preferred stock that pays its holders an
annual return of 14.25 percent in additional shares.
</P>
<P>
   The company's ratio of debt and preferred stock to operating
profits is an unusually hefty 10.9, according to Bishop Cheen, a
media analyst at First Union Capital Markets. This drain on profits
makes it tougher to bid for stations at a time when prices are
soaring and the giants are getting bigger.
</P>
<P>
   Competition for stations has mushroomed since 1996, when the
Federal Communications Commission virtually deregulated radio by
adopting rules that allow companies to own up to eight stations in
a single market and an unlimited number nationally.
</P>
<P>
   CBS, for example, now owns 161 stations. And Heftel, the
Alarcons' bigger Spanish-language competitor, which is publicly
held, owns 39 stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they are surrounded by giants, the question is whether to
consume or be consumed,'' Cheen said of Spanish Broadcasting.
``What they really should have is a smart strategic partner with
deep pockets.''
</P>
<P>
   The Alarcons do not disagree. Apart from seeking a partner or
considering a stock offering, the company could conceivably opt for
an outright sale. Indeed, Alarcon said Spanish Broadcasting had
already received a $1 billion offer _ though he declined to
identify the bidder, and several media executives said that figure
sounded high.
</P>
<P>
   The Alarcons say they want to retain their independence. Still,
if they intend for Spanish Broadcasting to grow and compete in a
rapidly consolidating marketplace, they may well decide to
sacrifice some of their autonomy _ either to a partner or to the
public.

<P>
   REDWOOD CITY, Calif. _ If David Farber, the government's central
witness at the Microsoft trial, is noteworthy for the number of
people who want to be included on his influential e-mail list, Paul
Vixie is famous _ some would say notorious _ for publishing an
online list that companies desperately want to avoid being on.
</P>
<P>
   Vixie is the creator and keeper of the Realtime Blackhole List,
a frequently updated list of Internet service providers and
Web-hosting companies that he concludes are being used to send
unsolicited bulk e-mail, or spam.
</P>
<P>
   Inclusion on the list is not merely embarrassing, it can be
costly. Hundreds of Internet service providers, universities and
other organizations around the world, following Vixie's advice,
automatically refuse to deliver messages originating from an
Internet service that has been ``blackholed'' (to use the industry
patois).
</P>
<P>
   When Vixie puts an Internet service provider, or ISP, on the
Blackhole list, the operator of that service will find that not
just spam but also regular e-mail is blocked from reaching all of
the service providers that adhere to Vixie's recommendations. Based
on Vixie's estimate of the number of subscribers to his list, he
says that a blackholed Internet provider will find itself unable to
send e-mail to 25 percent of the addresses on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Those services that have been blackholed at various times
include well-known companies like America Online, Microsoft
Network, ICG Communications' Netcom On-Line Services, and Earthlink
Network.
</P>
<P>
   Time spent in Vixie purgatory may last only a few minutes or can
sometimes stretch out for weeks, depending how quickly the labeled
offender takes anti-spam measures. Last June, the Microsoft Network
spent three-and-a-half days on the list after Vixie concluded the
company's e-mail servers were being used as a launching pad for
spam.
</P>
<P>
   Vixie acknowledges that his tactics may seem harsh, because even
nonspam messages get blocked, too. But he believes the severity of
the consequences provides the best way to get the attention of
offending ISPs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got e-mail from some mother who could no longer send e-mail
to her son in college,'' Vixie said. ``But either I cause a lot of
uncertainty for people until their ISP becomes a model network, or
the spammers win, and you and I, and that mother, would have
hundreds of messages coming in every day.''
</P>
<P>
   His goals may seem admirable. But Vixie, a 35-year old Internet
consultant without so much as a high-school diploma, is generating
increasing controversy because of his virtually unparalleled degree
of power to control Internet traffic.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some critics accuse Vixie of being arbitrary and
capricious. ``He's McCarthy reborn,'' said Alan Bechtold, owner of
BBS Press Service &UR;  &LR; Inc., an Internet service provider in Topeka,
Kan., which spent several days on the list last month. ``He's
arrogant, he believes in his cause,'' Bechtold said, ``but he's
totally blind to the damage he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Bechtold said his company, which operates Web server computers
on which other people maintain their own Web pages, was blackholed
because it once provided space for a Web page by a businessman who
used spam to advertise his own electronic-commerce business.
</P>
<P>
   But Bechtold said he had not been host to the businessman's site
since last July, and that the businessman was using a different
service to send the spam when Vixie added BBS to the Blackhole
list. When a reporter asked Vixie about this, he conceded that he
had not verified whether the businessman was still operating from
BBS when he added the company to the list.
</P>
<P>
   In his defense, Vixie's supporters say that in the unregulated
world of the Internet, he is tackling a problem that legislation
and technology have not been able to resolve.
</P>
<P>
   The Realtime Blackhole List ``works because people trust Paul to
make ethical, intelligent decisions about who goes on and who stays
off,'' said John Mozena, co-founder and vice president of the
Coalition Against Unsolicited Commercial e-mail, an anti-spam
lobbying and trade group. ``If there is a consensus leader among
the anti-spammers,'' Mozena said. ``it would be Paul.''

<P>
   Vixie works from an office here in this Silicon Valley city,
which is lighted by little more than his computer screens and is
shared only with Elroy, his Labrador retriever and German shepherd
mix. Vixie adds an ISP to his list once he determines its network
is the originating source of spam and it does not move quickly
enough to stop once he issues a warning.
</P>
<P>
   He says he promptly removes a company from the Blackhole list
when it has proved to him that its e-mail servers _ the powerful
computers that send, receive and distribute electronic messages _
are no longer being used to send or relay unsolicited bulk e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   He may act without government decree or official appointment,
but his rise to power is hardly inexplicable or without support.
Supporting himself through consulting work and charging nothing to
maintain his Blackhole list, Vixie toils to serve ISPs,
universities and others who operate e-mail servers and are
desperate to stop the flow of spam. They loathe unsolicited e-mail
because it clogs their systems, consumes computer processing power
and annoys their customers. And typically, only the largest
Internet service providers can afford to effectively track down and
fight spammers on their own.
</P>
<P>
   That is why it is typically smaller service providers that
subscribe to Vixie's list. By programming their own e-mail servers
to automatically retrieve and implement his recommendations on
which Internet providers to block, Vixie's subscribers are able to
identify and block the incoming spam. They are also making a
collective statement that other ISPs had better rid their systems
of spammers, or else have even nonspam messages go undelivered.
</P>
<P>
   Vixie said that the average stay on the Realtime Blackhole List
was no more than a few days. He said that on a typical day, he
would add five networks to the list, and remove two or three. He
said that very infrequently, if ever, would a subscriber to his
list wind up being blackholed, because they were companies or
organizations that tended to be as anxious to avoid spam as he is.
</P>
<P>
   Four volunteers working at separate locations help Vixie sift
through potential spam, which they have received directly from
spammers or which concerned cybercitizens have forwarded to the
organization's Web site (http://maps.vix.com/rbl). The team then
tries to track down the origin of the spam and send a warning to
the company that operates the originating mail server.
</P>
<P>
   Vixie recently demanded, for example, that Earthlink, a large
Southern California Internet service with 815,000 users, revamp its
system to guard more effectively against being used by spammers,
according to Steve Dougherty, Earthlink's director of Internet
operations. Dougherty said Earthlink had already been planning to
install such safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   He found Vixie to be terse and inflexible in his demands. And in
the end, Dougherty said he had little choice but to accede.
</P>
<P>
   ``We accelerated our schedule,'' Dougherty said. ``He wields
that kind of power. He's a guy who can drop 30 percent of our
traffic.'' &QL;

CLINTON STAKES OUT MORAL HIGH GROUND IN ISRAEL 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MIDEAST-CLINTON) 
(lb) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ President Clinton may have left the United States on
the heels of what one Israeli daily termed a congressional
intifada, using the Arabic term for uprising. He may have suffered
a lukewarm greeting from a reluctant host, Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu. He may face uncertain success rather than the triumphant
celebration of peace originally envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no question that Clinton is engaged in a critical
salvage mission for the faltering peace effort, and that he has
made himself an indispensable authority figure in the blood feud
between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   It may seem a peculiar role for him at this moment, given his
domestic troubles, but here Clinton is staking out the moral high
ground.
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of Hanukkah, a newspaper cartoon in the daily Yediot
Ahrnoth depicted the American president as a burning candle who had
come to ``dispel darkness'' _ as did the Maccabees in the revolt
commemorated by the Festival of Lights.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when Netanyahu and Clinton addressed a convention hall
filled with teen-agers on Sunday night, they were a study in
contrasts, dark and light.
</P>
<P>
   In a calm but defensive speech, laced with attacks on the
Palestinians, Netanyahu made clear to the youth of his country the
mistrust that underlies his commitment to the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   He said Palestinians could roam through Israel freely, visiting
Tel Aviv or the beach at Netanya. In contrast, he said, ``Well, you
can enter Gaza _ that's for sure _ but getting out of there, that's
a different story.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, on the other hand, gave an uplifting,
optimistically American speech. He made clear that he empathized
with ``the history of heartbreak'' that defines Israeli-Palestinian
relations, but he preached accommodation to immutable realities.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing and only one thing is predestined,'' Clinton said.
``You are bound to be neighbors. The question is not whether you
will live side by side, but how.''
</P>
<P>
   On Israeli television, which carried the event live, when a
commentator managed to speak above the din of cheers, he said the
scene ``looked and sounded like a Democratic National Convention.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Clinton's arrival, municipal workers hastened to scrape
hostile posters from the city's walls: doctored photographs
picturing the American president wearing an Arab head scarf, with
the Hebrew caption ``I am a Palestinian.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Netanyahu's Cabinet had to be persuaded to refrain
from expressing too loudly their displeasure at Clinton's visit,
which is organized around a trip to Gaza on Monday for a meeting of
the Palestine National Council.
</P>
<P>
   The Cabinet members, opponents of the peace effort, said they
believed that his trip would come across as an endorsement of
Palestinian sovereignty. They also clearly feared that it could
repair the breakdown in relations between the Israelis and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   But many Israelis, speaking privately, on the radio, or in
newspapers, expressed embarrassment at the government's tepid if
not hostile reception of an American president who is particularly
popular in Israel and who is making his fourth trip here at a
moment many perceive to be fateful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important for you to know that not all of us are
deceitful,'' Meir Shalev, a novelist, wrote in a newspaper column.
``Not all of us are grave worshippers, not all of us are paranoid,
not all of us are existential stones, not all of us are uncouth,
thankless beggars.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper Maariv dedicated its front page to a column by its
editor in chief, Yaakov Erez, welcoming the ``leader of the free
world.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We all hope, save for the radical fringes, that Clinton will
be able to bridge the abyss at our feet, exhibit his magic touch in
his talks with Arafat and Netanyahu, and restore the hope of peace
to our chests,'' Erez said.
</P>
<P>
   It is a tricky role for the American president, one setting what
could be a dangerous precedent in a very rocky process. Clearly,
the Americans have moved from mediators to overseers and guarantors
of the peace effort. But it would soon become untenable if the
Israelis and the Palestinians needed not only U.S. assistance but
direct presidential intervention to clear the major bumps in the
road.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton and Netanyahu were at odds on Sunday. After a meeting
that lasted all morning, in which they reportedly spent only 10
minutes alone, they shook hands laterally, reaching across their
bodies as both faced forward looking grim.
</P>
<P>
   They then presented different realities. In Netanyahu's report
card on the implementation of the peace accord, the Israelis passed
with flying colors and the Palestinians were completely delinquent.
Using harsh language, he blamed Palestinian leaders for ``openly
inciting violence and riots'' and for organizing violent
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   He also said his own domestic political problems _ the fact that
his government, hanging on by a thread, might benefit by lurching
rightward _ played no role in the Israeli freezing of the
implementation.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Clinton praised and condemned actions on both
sides, although he did single out the recent unrest in the
Palestinian territories. And he repeatedly referred to Netanyahu's
``political constraints,'' as well as to those of Yasser Arafat,
the Palestinian leader.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Clinton repeatedly underscored the cash bounty waiting
for the Israelis _ $1.2 billion in economic assistance, if Congress
approves his request.
</P>
<P>
   Tethering the vaunted U.S. idealism, which some Israelis and
some Palestinians believe to be diplomatic naivete, is the promise
of a fat new American purse.

IRELAND TO RECONSIDER POLITY OF NEUTRALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN _ The government is moving cautiously but unmistakably
toward a relaxation of Ireland's bedrock national policy: the
military neutrality it has proudly maintained since gaining
independence from Britain 76 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The change is being pressed by Foreign Minister David Andrews,
whose governing political party, Fianna Fail (Warriors of Destiny),
has always denounced any move away from strict neutrality as
disloyal to Ireland, if not treasonous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a hugely emotional issue,'' said Fergus Finlay, a
political consultant and former senior official in the Foreign
Affairs Department. ``For neutrality, read independence. For an
awful lot of people neutrality is the cornerstone of our foreign
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Andrews, in a series of national radio and television
interviews and newspaper articles, is arguing that Ireland's
neutrality should be reconsidered to permit the country to join the
U.S.-sponsored Partnership for Peace, a group of nations that do
not belong to NATO but have agreed to coordinate military polices
with it.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews said the government would decide on the issue next year
and that the decision could lead to a referendum on neutrality.
</P>
<P>
   Some officials and diplomats say the government will try to
avoid a referendum by arguing that one is needed only if Ireland's
neutrality is threatened, and that the association with NATO is not
such a threat.
</P>
<P>
   The shift away from strict neutrality has been urged on Ireland
for several years by the United States and by Ireland's European
neighbors. In 1994, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, Robert Hunter,
visited Dublin to urge top Irish officials to join the NATO
program, which falls short of full membership.
</P>
<P>
   When the new U.S. ambassador, Dan Sullivan, arrives in Dublin in
January, he is expected to restate the White House view that
Ireland should join the partnership. It is not that the
12,000-strong Irish Army would play a major role in a big European
war. It would continue to act as a peacekeeper, as the 700 Irish
troops are doing now in southern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   But in a sense, U.S. and European diplomats say, Ireland owes
allegiance.
</P>
<P>
   After remaining neutral in World War II, Ireland received the
protection of the U.S. nuclear umbrella during the Cold War. At the
same time, it received about $30 billion in development aid from
the European Union. While 40,000 Irish volunteers fought in the
British Army in World War II, many Irish men and women recall, some
with shame, that on the death of Hitler in 1945 Prime Minister
Eamon de Valera signed a condolence book at the German Embassy in
Dublin.
</P>
<P>
   He later maintained that at the time, unlike other European
leaders, he did not know of the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Neutrality has had a deep impact on modern Ireland. De Valera's
decision to keep Ireland neutral, which enraged British Prime
Minister Winston Churchill, was based, historians say, on a fear
that there would be public disorder, if not civil war, if Irish
troops were ordered to fight with those of Britain, the despised
colonial power in Ireland until 1922.
</P>
<P>
   Some historians say that because Northern Ireland, as a British
province, sent tens of thousands of troops to the war, the result
was a tightening of the political union between London and the
Protestant-dominated North. This, in turn, made it politically
difficult for Britain to agree to negotiations giving the
overwhelmingly Roman Catholic Irish Republic more influence in
Northern Ireland's affairs. The new Northern Ireland peace
agreement approved in the spring tries to solve that problem.
</P>
<P>
   Enemies of any relaxation of neutrality include fringe
nationalists who have argued that the partnership would lead to
British soldiers ordering Irish troops in battle, or even in
barracks in Ireland. Other opponents include the Green Party, which
delights in pointing out that the Unites States has not paid its
full U.N. dues and that this slows down payments to the Irish Army
for its service in Lebanon. Officials acknowledge that the army
makes a profit from peacekeeping. Some 40 Irish soldiers are
expected to go to Kosovo as part of a peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people would see the partnership as a steppingstone to
NATO,'' Finlay said.
</P>
<P>
   Andrews wrote in The Irish Times that ``as a voluntary,
nonbinding security framework based on cooperation'' the
partnership has been joined by ``all the other European neutral
nations, Austria, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does not entail membership of any alliance,'' he added.
``and since a country which goes to such enormous lengths to defend
its neutrality, such as Switzerland, has no difficulty
participating, I do not believe that the case against our
participation on these grounds is persuasive.''

 &HT;    UNDECIDED REPUBLICANS EDGE TOWARD IMPEACHMENT AFTER CLINTON
AGAIN DENIES LYING
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM President Clinton on Sunday stood hard by his
insistence that he did not commit perjury and asked members of the
House to look to their conscience, their constituents and the
Constitution and choose censure over impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Apparently, somewhere around three-quarters of the American
people think that's the right thing to do,'' Clinton said during a
press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   But undecided Republicans indicated they were leaning toward
voting for impeachment after Clinton said again that he didn't lie
under oath.
</P>
<P>
   One, Rep. Bob Ney of Ohio, said Clinton ``hurt himself very
clearly'' with his repeated assertion on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jay Dickey of Arkansas, another undecided Republican who
joined Ney on ABC's ``This Week'' program, said Clinton's Sunday
denial ``just kind of leaves us in a vacuum again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Two simple words, 'I lied,' would have gone a long way,''
added Rep. Rick Lazio, another undecided Republican from New York.
Lazio, one of more than a dozen lawmakers accompanying Clinton on
his Mideast trip, made his comments on CNN's ``Late Edition.''
</P>
<P>
   The odds are now ``fairly strong'' that the House will vote to
impeach Clinton, Democrat Rep. Charles Schumer of New York conceded
on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   The full House is expected to take up four articles of
impeachment on Thursday. A majority vote of 218 on any of them
would send it to a trial in the Senate, where two-thirds of those
lawmakers are needed to convict and remove the president from
office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has ruled out admitting perjury as a way to mollify
Capitol Hill critics who say his refusal to acknowledge lying under
oath has undercut his repeated apologies for misleading public
statements about his involvement with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no intention of doing that,'' Clinton said Sunday. ''I
did not commit perjury...I could not admit to doing something that
I am quite sure I did not do.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the remarks in response to repeated questions on
the Lewinsky matter during the 30-minute joint press conference
with Netanyahu. The two leaders held some four hours of closed door
talks on how to get the imperiled Israeli-Palestinian peace process
back on track, but there was no apparent breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's three-day visit here is the fourth of his presidency
in search of a way to advance the deeply troubled peace process.
One of his first acts upon arrival was to call key Democrats on the
House Judiciary Committee to discuss impeachment prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were a couple of committee Democrats. I'm not precisely
sure who they were,'' said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps two dozen House Republicans are regarded as undecided on
the impeachment articles, and their votes could determine whether
Clinton becomes only the second president in U.S. history to be
impeached by the House.
</P>
<P>
   This week's looming House impeachment votes have cast a sobering
pall over the administration, and it was apparent Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   His expression ranging from glum to grim, Clinton staggered
through the press conference, which was dominated by
scandal-related questions from both Israeli and American reporters.
At one point, Netanyahu took the unusual step of interrupting an
Israeli reporter to admonish him to ask about peace talks, not
impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ''May I ask a favor,'' Netanyahu said. ''The president has come
here on a very clear...voyage of peace, and I believe that it would
be appropriate also to ask one or two questions on the peace
process.''
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee has sent to the full House two
articles of impeachment alleging that Clinton committed perjury
once during a sworn deposition in the Paula Jones sexual harassment
suit and again during grand jury testimony concerning his
relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said on Sunday that even if he is impeached by the House
and there is a Senate trial, he will fight rather than step down.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no intention of resigning,'' Clinton said in response
to a question. ''It's never crossed my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has admitted wrongdoing in the Lewinsky matter,
said on Friday that he would accept the official disgrace and
public opprobrium of congressional censure a non-binding
declaration that he had brought dishonor to his office through
inappropriate conduct.
</P>
<P>
   He reiterated on Sunday his hope that the House would opt for
censure over impeachment. The president obliquely alluded to his
high job approval ratings in opinion polls they have remained above
65 percent nationally through most of the year as evidence that the
public has essentially endorsed that approach.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders, led by Speaker-to-be Bob Livingston of
Louisiana, have said they will not allow a censure vote on the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   But House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri said
Democrats will try to bring it up anyway. When they are ruled out
of order, he said, Democrats will use a parliamentary maneuver to
force a vote on whether the censure measure should be brought up as
an alternative to the articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Making a direct appeal to lawmakers, Clinton urged them to
reject partisan arm-twisting and instead to ''vote his or her
conscience, based on the Constitution and the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Clinton, ''I think it's important that they be free to make
this decision and that they not be put under any undue pressure
from any quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House, however, has been quietly waging its own
campaign to win over undecided Republicans. By Sunday, nearly every
undecided Republican had been contacted by members of Clinton's
cabinet, his lawyers or other senior administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''We talked to most, if not all, of the members of Congress who
are in the process of making up their mind,'' said Lockhart. ''That
will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he has spoken personally with some House
Republicans who requested conversations with him on the subject,
but he said it was not his role to actively lobby House members on
the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have talked to those, a few, who said they wanted to talk to
me. Otherwise, I have not,'' Clinton said. ''I don't think it's
appropriate for me to be personally calling people. Unless they
send word to me that there is some question they want to ask or
something they want to say, I don't think it's appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the White House campaign, Clinton conceded that the
outcome of this week's House votes remained in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what's going to happen,'' said Clinton. ''It's
out of my hands.''

House to look to their conscience, their constituents and the
Constitution and choose censure over impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ''Apparently, somewhere around three-quarters of the American
people think that's the right thing to do,'' Clinton said during a
press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   But undecided Republicans indicated they were leaning toward
voting for impeachment after Clinton said again that he didn't lie
under oath.
</P>
<P>
   One, Rep. Bob Ney of Ohio, said Clinton ``hurt himself very
clearly'' with his repeated assertion on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jay Dickey of Arkansas, another undecided Republican who
joined Ney on ABC's ``This Week'' program, said Clinton's Sunday
denial ``just kind of leaves us in a vacuum again.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Two simple words, 'I lied,' would have gone a long way,''
added Rep. Rick Lazio, another undecided Republican from New York.
Lazio, one of more than a dozen lawmakers accompanying Clinton on
his Mideast trip, made his comments on CNN's ``Late Edition.''
</P>
<P>
   The odds are now ``fairly strong'' that the House will vote to
impeach Clinton, Democrat Rep. Charles Schumer of New York conceded
on CNN.
</P>
<P>
   The full House is expected to take up four articles of
impeachment on Thursday. A majority vote of 218 on any of them
would send it to a trial in the Senate, where two-thirds of those
lawmakers are needed to convict and remove the president from
office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has ruled out admitting perjury as a way to mollify
Capitol Hill critics who say his refusal to acknowledge lying under
oath has undercut his repeated apologies for misleading public
statements about his involvement with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no intention of doing that,'' Clinton said Sunday. ''I
did not commit perjury...I could not admit to doing something that
I am quite sure I did not do.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton made the remarks in response to repeated questions on
the Lewinsky matter during the 30-minute joint press conference
with Netanyahu. The two leaders held some four hours of closed door
talks on how to get the imperiled Israeli-Palestinian peace process
back on track, but there was no apparent breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's three-day visit here is the fourth of his presidency
in search of a way to advance the deeply troubled peace process.
One of his first acts upon arrival was to call key Democrats on the
House Judiciary Committee to discuss impeachment prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were a couple of committee Democrats. I'm not precisely
sure who they were,'' said White House spokesman Joe Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps two dozen House Republicans are regarded as undecided on
the impeachment articles, and their votes could determine whether
Clinton becomes only the second president in U.S. history to be
impeached by the House.
</P>
<P>
   This week's looming House impeachment votes have cast a sobering
pall over the administration, and it was apparent Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   His expression ranging from glum to grim, Clinton staggered
through the press conference, which was dominated by
scandal-related questions from both Israeli and American reporters.
At one point, Netanyahu took the unusual step of interrupting an
Israeli reporter to admonish him to ask about peace talks, not
impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ''May I ask a favor,'' Netanyahu said. ''The president has come
here on a very clear...voyage of peace, and I believe that it would
be appropriate also to ask one or two questions on the peace
process.''
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee has sent to the full House two
articles of impeachment alleging that Clinton committed perjury
once during a sworn deposition in the Paula Jones sexual harassment
suit and again during grand jury testimony concerning his
relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said on Sunday that even if he is impeached by the House
and there is a Senate trial, he will fight rather than step down.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no intention of resigning,'' Clinton said in response
to a question. ''It's never crossed my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has admitted wrongdoing in the Lewinsky matter,
said on Friday that he would accept the official disgrace and
public opprobrium of congressional censure a non-binding
declaration that he had brought dishonor to his office through
inappropriate conduct.
</P>
<P>
   He reiterated on Sunday his hope that the House would opt for
censure over impeachment. The president obliquely alluded to his
high job approval ratings in opinion polls they have remained above
65 percent nationally through most of the year as evidence that the
public has essentially endorsed that approach.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders, led by Speaker-to-be Bob Livingston of
Louisiana, have said they will not allow a censure vote on the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   But House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri said
Democrats will try to bring it up anyway. When they are ruled out
of order, he said, Democrats will use a parliamentary maneuver to
force a vote on whether the censure measure should be brought up as
an alternative to the articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Making a direct appeal to lawmakers, Clinton urged them to
reject partisan arm-twisting and instead to ''vote his or her
conscience, based on the Constitution and the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Clinton, ''I think it's important that they be free to make
this decision and that they not be put under any undue pressure
from any quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House, however, has been quietly waging its own
campaign to win over undecided Republicans. By Sunday, nearly every
undecided Republican had been contacted by members of Clinton's
cabinet, his lawyers or other senior administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''We talked to most, if not all, of the members of Congress who
are in the process of making up their mind,'' said Lockhart. ''That
will continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he has spoken personally with some House
Republicans who requested conversations with him on the subject,
but he said it was not his role to actively lobby House members on
the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have talked to those, a few, who said they wanted to talk to
me. Otherwise, I have not,'' Clinton said. ''I don't think it's
appropriate for me to be personally calling people. Unless they
send word to me that there is some question they want to ask or
something they want to say, I don't think it's appropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the White House campaign, Clinton conceded that the
outcome of this week's House votes remained in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know what's going to happen,'' said Clinton. ''It's
out of my hands.''

<P>
   MOZHAISK, Russia _ It is lunch time in the children's quarters
at the women's prison colony here, and 10 little pale faces are
bent over bowls of grey mush, a blend of watery potatoes with a
dash of meat. The meal is not a big hit with the scruffy
2-year-olds, but for the women who are trying to coax spoonfuls
into their mouths, the fact that there is anything on the table at
all is a small victory.
</P>
<P>
   By their calculations, the Russian government has practically
stopped paying a daily food allowance for the 64 children, all
under age 3, who live in the fenced compound where their mothers
are serving sentences for crimes ranging from theft to murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, for the children, we received 185,000 rubles,''
said Lyudmila Yareva, who as head of the children's house can
recite these figures by heart. ``After salaries and taxes, 47,000
goes to food, which as you understand is nothing at all.''
</P>
<P>
   At the rate the ruble is going these days, nothing is just about
on target. Four months ago, 47,000 rubles was worth roughly $7,000.
Today, as the value of the currency continues its downward drift,
it is worth one-third that amount, or roughly $36 per child a year.
</P>
<P>
   In a time of shrinking budgets and rising inflation, when Russia
cannot afford to pay its teachers or army officers a regular wage,
let alone come up with the cash for multibillion-dollar payments on
its foreign debt, state institutions like this one have been set
adrift. At prisons and hospitals, orphanages and psychiatric
hospitals, money for inmates _ their food, clothes, medicine and
bed sheets _ is being squeezed out like drops from a desiccated
lemon.
</P>
<P>
   Here in this women's prison, the official daily food allowance
for the 1,600 women is 65 kopeks, about three cents at current
exchange rates. Down the road at a juvenile detention center, the
sum is greater _ 80 kopeks _ because as one official explained
ruefully, his charges are ``under age'' and need more food to grow.
According to the Ministry of Justice, the national average in
Russian jails and prison camps is 67 kopeks.
</P>
<P>
   But these are official sums, which in Russia these days are
usually not worth much more than the paper they are written on. In
fact, here in Mozhaisk, 60 miles southwest of Moscow, the women's
prison actually spends almost four times more on its children than
its budget allows.
</P>
<P>
   How Mrs. Yareva manages to clothe and feed her charges adds up
to another one of those baffling puzzles that explain how this
country and its people are able to survive in their calamity-prone
economy. The answer is, as usual, a mishmash _ involving both the
kindness of strangers and a dash of native ingenuity.
</P>
<P>
   The potatoes, for instance, come from a local farm which now
relies on women prisoners to help dig up their crop. Milk is also
``free,'' after the prison, unable to dig its way out of a mountain
of unpaid bills, agreed to provide milk maids to the local dairy.
Soap comes from a local store owner who, after some pleading by the
prison wardens, agreed to throw in a donation together with regular
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, these wards of the Russian state survive on
``gumanitarka,'' the Russian nickname for the humanitarian aid that
in the last years has been sent to institutions like this one. In
this case, toys, blankets, medicine and mattresses come from all
over _ from Norway, from Germany, but also from sources close to
home: from the grandmother who periodically shows up at the prison
gates with a pile of neatly stacked baby clothes, to the
Association of Russian Aristocrats, whose help is acknowledged by
the signed photograph in Mrs. Yareva's office of the Grand Duchess
Maria Romanova, and her son Georgi, acknowledged by some as the
heir to the Russian imperial throne.
</P>
<P>
   ``We run around, we ask, we beg, we do what we can,'' Mrs.
Yareva said, a bitterness creeping into her voice as she remembers
the days when the prison got more money from the state than it was
able to spend. The last normal year, she recalls, was 1990, when
Russia was still Communist, before ``democratism, or whatever it is
you call this.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with help, the diet for these children is not what it
should be. By Mrs. Yareva's reckoning, they actually live on 16
rubles (about 80 cents) a day, when the ``norm'' should be 20 (a
dollar). The missing four rubles, she says, would go a long way
toward buying them the proper portions of eggs, fruits and
vegetables that they should be getting, and do not.
</P>
<P>
   Even getting the supplies they have received requires running
around. For three weeks, prison wardens have been on tenterhooks,
awaiting the delivery of a container full of gumanitarka that has
been held up with red tape at a local customs office.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are papers that have to be signed at every level,''
Lidiya I. Pustovoit, a deputy prison director, explained as she
dashed out the door to do battle for the shipment one more time.
``Each time I go there, there is another level, and another batch
of papers.''
</P>
<P>
   Bureaucracy and budget shortfalls are part of the prison's
routine. But what happened in Russia on Aug. 17, when the ruble
devalued and the banking system froze up after the government
defaulted on its ruble debts, was an unexpected jolt, which threw a
season's worth of planned repairs into confusion.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the banks released the allocated funds, fall here
was turning to winter. By the time new pipes were being installed
in the two-story house where the children live, winter had set in.
The result has been an irregular water supply, and days with no hot
water at all, at a time when temperatures here had dropped below
freezing.
</P>
<P>
   But for mothers like Yanna Strukova, 27, who is here on a
seven-year sentence for armed robbery, having her son, Seryozha,
close by, where she can spend two hours a day with him, is for the
moment better than the alternative. When he turns 3 three next
month, she faces a choice: either he goes to a state orphanage, or
she has to persuade her mother-in-law, who already looks after her
older daughter, to take him in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole problem is money,'' she said, shrugging her
shoulders. ``Imagine, a grandmother on a pension of 400 rubles,
keeping two children. She doesn't even have the money to travel up
here and pick him up.''

   MIDEAST-IMPEACH _ JERUSALEM _ Facing Republican demands that he
admit lying before a grand jury, President Clinton insisted Sunday
that he did not perjure himself and said he will not resign. ``I
cannot admit to doing something that I am quite sure I did not
do,'' he said at a press conference with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu. Clinton urged the House to listen to ``75
percent of the American people'' and censure him instead of voting
for impeachment. Story will wrap in the day's other impeachment
developments. (Deans, Cox News Service)

<P>
   MIDEAST-PEACE _ JERUSALEM _ President Clinton urged Israelis and
Palestinians to engage in ``honest discussion,'' not violence, as
they seek to resolve their differences over the Wye River
land-for-peace deal. As the president sought to get the peace
process back on track, there were indications that the Israelis
will continue to insist on delaying scheduled troop withdrawals
from Palestinian territories. (Deans, Cox News Service)

<P>
   MIDEAST-BILLFANS _ JERUSALEM Clinton may be in trouble on
Capitol Hill, but he is overwhelmingly popular with most Israelis.

the man they have, Benjamin Netanyahu, or his opposition, Ehud
Barak. (Kaplow, Cox News Service) MOVED

LET'S DO MORE TO REFORM SOCIAL SECURITY THAN REMOVE THE WAGE CAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: The latest bad idea to ``save'' Social Security is
removal of the payroll tax's wage cap, which has tremendous
political appeal because it represents a tax increase that would
hit only the most highly paid workers.
</P>
<P>
   It's a bad idea because it's proffered without any recognition
of the need to make the payroll tax more progressive. This makes it
nothing more than a money-grubbing revenue-enhancement scheme,
because Social Security taxes already generate far more income than
is needed to finance benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Excess Social Security revenue, as has been noted in this space
ad nauseam, is spent by the Treasury, and the trust fund gets an
IOU in return that Uncle Sam must redeem when income falls short of
outgo.
</P>
<P>
   What sort of reform would justify unlimited Social Security
taxation? How about a system that exempts the first $5,000 or so of
income? This would protect wage earners at the bottom of the
ladder, for whom Social Security taxes are egregiously regressive.
Counting the employer's contribution, these poor souls are burdened
with a 12.4 percent tax on their first dollar of income.
</P>
<P>
   For a society that prides itself on fairness and compassion for
the economically disadvantaged, imposing taxes this regressive on
struggling low-income workers borders on a criminal abuse of
government's taxing power.
</P>
<P>
   Removal of the wage cap probably would go a long way toward
generating enough extra revenue to finance such an exemption. If it
fell short, the current annual surpluses could be tapped to make up
the difference.
</P>
<P>
   For those who would like to take reform a step further or in
another direction, an interesting proposal was offered last week by
Alvin Rabushka, a Hoover Institution senior fellow who's best known
as a pioneering proponent of the flat-rate tax.
</P>
<P>
   Rabushka outlined his plan in an essay in The Wall Street
Journal, calling not only for an end to the wage cap, but also an
extension of the Social Security levy to dividends, interest and
capital gains income. Using 1996 Internal Revenue Service data,
Rabushka estimates this would boost annual tax proceeds by more
than $130 billion.
</P>
<P>
   One part of Rabushka's plan is to use some of the extra revenue
to finance a privatization effort. If workers are allowed to divert
part of their Social Security tax to individual savings accounts,
this would reduce Social Security tax income. Any such loss,
however, could be more than recouped, he said, by removing the wage
cap and expanding the base.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of exempting a certain level of income from Social
Security taxes, though, Rabushka's proposed reform would link the
Social Security changes to a flat-rate income tax with liberal
exemptions. This, he says, would create the progressivity needed to
make the overall system more fair to lower-income workers.
</P>
<P>
   None of this is to say Rabushka's plan is the best of the reform
proposals on the table. It is to say, however, that tax-policy
proposals are worth discussing only if they transcend the greedy
tendencies of Washington's tax-and-spend crowd.
</P>
<P>
   If the aim of a tax proposal is simply to bleed more money from
productive taxpayers rather than create a more equitable system, no
American should dignify such initiatives with serious discussion.

   IMPEACH (Washington) _ With the full House returning for a vote
on impeachment this week, President Clinton on Sunday rebuffed
Republican calls for him to admit to lying under oath and said
flatly that he had not committed perjury. He deflected calls for
him to step down. ``I have no intention of resigning,'' he said.
``It's never crossed my mind.'' Unable to escape the constitutional
crisis engulfing his presidency, the president fielded questions
about his fate in Jerusalem, where he had flown to try to revive
the Middle East peace process. Back home, leading Republicans said
he could save the nation from an impeachment trial by stepping
down.

trend: the sharp increase in the number of youngsters with Type 2
diabetes, also known as adult-onset diabetes, an incurable and

blindness and poor circulation, which, in turn, can lead to
amputation. Doctors long believed the disease occurred only during
middle age or later. Although there have not been any national
surveys documenting the rise of this form of diabetes in children,
several small-scale studies have found that such cases have more
than tripled in the last five years.

THE ERA OF THE INFERIOR COPY LOOMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: The fervidness of research into mammalian cloning is
matched only by the controversy over cloning's moral and social
implications. And the debate is sure to be made hotter by the
success of Japanese scientists in producing eight identical calves
from a cow's cells collected in a slaughterhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Half of the cloned creatures died at birth or shortly after, but
the other four survive, in apparent good health. So once again the
central question is brought into sharp focus:
</P>
<P>
   If a procedure once thought fantastical can be carried out
almost routinely in other animals, what _ if anything _ is to
prevent its being repeated in human beings?
</P>
<P>
   The obvious answer, of course, is that nothing is likely to
prevent it. Not proscriptions of law or religious teaching. Not, it
would appear, any practical impediment. And not, certainly, any
voluntary restraint.
</P>
<P>
   For the governing ethic (if it's to be called that) of our time
seems to be that if something can be done, then it follows
naturally that it must be attempted. Certain things may be
impossible. But nothing is unthinkable.
</P>
<P>
   It was this dissonance between possibility and principle that
chilled scientists engaged in wartime nuclear research, when they
realized they had not merely solved an elegant riddle of physics;
they had unlocked a force that could threaten the future of
humanity itself.
</P>
<P>
   Not all people, not all scientists, not all societies, however,
are animated by such scruples.
</P>
<P>
   In ancient Egypt, when Pharaoh died, it was custom for some of
his beasts and his essential servants to be entombed with him, to
accompany him for his comfort and convenience in the next world.
</P>
<P>
   A bizarre notion, you say. And yet today, people of sufficient
means and madness may have their corpses cryogenically preserved,
to await the future discovery of some cure for the diseases that
claimed them.
</P>
<P>
   Several years ago a man told me _ someone who may have been in a
position to know, and who swore it was truth _ that Walt Disney's
head was preserved in an underground storage vault in Kansas City,
on the chance it could someday be rejoined to a serviceable body.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds far-fetched. But in any case, the newspaper I write
for was owned then by the Disney company. So, for reasons I trust
you understand, I didn't mention this in my column.
</P>
<P>
   The issue now, however, is cloning, which strikes me as being
only slightly less bizarre.
</P>
<P>
   It raises the possibility that adult human beings, as they saw
time shortening and their run moving toward its end, might give
issue to children who would be precise physical copies of
themselves, or perhaps even to multiples of such copies.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere, some time in the not-too-distant future, that surely
will be done. And it will afford a kind of immortality, I suppose,
but immortality of a cheap sort _ cheap in the same sense that a
mechanical photocopy of a work of art is less valuable than the
hand-created original.
</P>
<P>
   All that can be said with fair certainty is some of us will not
be interested in being duplicated.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, the body of experience that is responsible for
most of who we are could not be transmitted or replicated in our
clones. The genetic cargoes might be the same. But we would be only
strangers who, because of the differences in ages, wouldn't even
look a thing alike.
</P>
<P>
   Our outcomes, too, would be different _ a mercy, since most of
us know our own mistakes so well.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike those cloned calves in Japan, the copies of us
probably wouldn't even be suitable for table.

HERE'S A SUGGESTION FOR A HOLIDAY GIFT FOR YOUR BOSS: NOTHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: Want to know what to get your boss for the holidays?
</P>
<P>
   The most career-savvy answer is nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago I read about a Maryland woman who gave her
boss one of her kidneys. It wasn't a holiday gift, but it set
office ethicists pontificating about the mixed messages sent when
subordinates give gifts _ especially lavish ones _ to their bosses.
</P>
<P>
   The kidney donor's boss was touched and grateful. Neither he nor
the donor said they considered in the slightest what consequences
such a gift would have on their workplace relationship. Theirs is a
sincerely lovely story.
</P>
<P>
   But an informal Wall Street Journal survey found that many
bosses get the creepy crawlies when their employees give them
gifts. The bosses said they worry that the giver is fawning over
them or expecting future favors.
</P>
<P>
   Others admit they worry about their abilities to judge gift
givers fairly in future personnel matters, especially if the gifts
were good ones. Mostly, though, the bosses said they don't have
time to acknowledge gifts, and they certainly don't need them.
</P>
<P>
   There may be a few numskulls out there who'll give you favors in
exchange for a nice gift. Mercifully, those loonies are rare. Most
will see through misguided gift-giving.
</P>
<P>
   Many others will feel just a little uneasy, especially if they
don't reciprocate in kind, at even the most modest, cleanly
motivated gift.
</P>
<P>
   If you simply can't get through the holidays without giving
gifts to supervisors, please consider alternatives to a bottle of
booze, a tie, a box of candy, golf balls or any other merchandise
item.
</P>
<P>
   How about making a donation to a favorite charity in the boss's
name? You could write the check to your own favorite philanthropy,
but you might score more gratitude points if you direct it to the
boss's pet project.
</P>
<P>
   Even better, you could write your manager a nice note, telling
why you enjoy working for him or her. If you can't do that
sincerely, you probably have no business giving a gift at all.

   WILMETTE, Ill. _ At the mention of President Clinton's name,
Sean Lewis can barely conceal his displeasure. ``It's hard to have
any respect for Clinton,'' he said, ``and he certainly doesn't
deserve any pity.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lewis, a 32-year-old marketing director, fiercely opposes
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is not what's best for Clinton, but what's best
for the country,'' Lewis said. ``And it's not good for the country
to go through an impeachment trial and maybe throw him out of
office.''
</P>
<P>
   This congressional district north of Chicago, with its lakefront
mansions and elegant boutiques, leans heavily toward the Republican
Party, its voters more intent on a soaring stock market than on any
socially conservative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Porter, a moderate in his 10th term, fits this
district like his finely tailored suits. He is among the handful of
Republicans who have not declared their intentions yet on
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Porter had initially spoken out against impeachment, but later
said he would consider it after the House Judiciary Committee had
concluded its work.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Porter, Dave Kohn, said calls to the
congressman's office have changed in tone a bit recently. Months
ago, he said, calls were heavily in favor of impeachment. In recent
days, however, he said nearly as many people were calling to urge
Porter to vote against impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the talk on the streets here, a vast majority of
North Shore residents appear to oppose impeachment, even among
those who voted against Clinton, like Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Some people said they dreaded the prospect of a sensational
trial in the Senate that would rely heavily on tawdry details.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll look like jackasses to the rest of the world,'' Denice
Mason, 65, said. ``They'll think we're absolutely absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of her friends nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't these politicians read the polls?'' Annette Abrams, 67,
asked. ``Didn't they pay attention to the election results?''
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte Rogers, 77, chimed in, ``There are too many other
things going on in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, it is not impossible to find people here who favor
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a Constitution and it must apply,'' said Peter Anton,
67, a project manager for a construction company. ``How can we say
that the commander-in-chief doesn't have to abide by the same rules
as his generals? All you get from the president is double talk.''
</P>
<P>
   He shook his head and raised his palms skyward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I don't really like the idea of all this being on
television, with little kids hearing all these details,'' he added.
``But we can blame Clinton for that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Merriam, a 23-year-old psychologist, does not have fond
regard for Clinton. But she believes an impeachment trial would
mean ``chaos for the government.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton is immoral and irresponsible, but let's let the law
deal with him after he gets out of office,'' Ms. Merriam said.
``Think of the money all of this is costing the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually none of the voters said they believed Clinton should
go unpunished, although Ms. Abrams said, ``So he had an affair in
the White House. Didn't Kennedy, too, and how many others?''
</P>
<P>
   Censure seemed to be the most popular option, even with Ms.
Abrams.
</P>
<P>
   Others acknowledged that they might feel more inclined to call
for more severe punishment, if the economy were ailing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, having Clinton in office has been pretty good
for this country,'' said Lewis, the marketing manager. ``Times are
booming for a lot of people right now. I know I'm enjoying my
prosperity. I can buy a lot of toys. And I don't want the
politicians doing something that's going to put that at risk.''

DEMOCRATIC HOUSE MEMBER REMAINS UNDECIDED ABOUT IMPEACHMENT VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Pat Danner fumbles in her purse and pulls out
a white, plastic card.
</P>
<P>
   This is a U.S. representative's voting pass, the one she inserts
in a slot at her seat on the House floor every time she's called to
make a vote in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The options are always the same: The green button for yes, the
red for no, the yellow button for abstain.
</P>
<P>
   Which color Danner pushes this week, though, isn't clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honest to God could swear on a witness stand that I do not
know how I'm going to vote,'' the Missouri Democrat said last week.
</P>
<P>
   She was preparing for the upcoming, historic _ and
too-close-to-call _ roll call on the impeachment of the 42nd
president of the United States, Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may not even decide until I put that card in the slot.''
</P>
<P>
   Forces keep tugging her in opposing directions. Phone callers to
her congressional offices are split on the question. People she
meets in her 6th District, which stretches from Kansas City north
to the Iowa border, tell her one thing, then another.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, she met with two groups in St. Joseph. One urged
impeachment, the other the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hearing impeach, don't impeach, impeach, don't impeach,''
said Danner, who is among a handful of Democrats and perhaps two
dozen mostly moderate Republicans whose positions are not known.
``No matter what I do, people are going to think I didn't vote
their view.''
</P>
<P>
   Her district flops from one party to the other in elections:
Republican Kit Bond for Senate, Democrat Mel Carnahan for governor,
Republican John Ashcroft for Senate, Democrat Bill Clinton for
president.
</P>
<P>
   Danner may be on the fence, but other lawmakers from Kansas and
Missouri are not. Rep. Vince Snowbarger, a Kansas Republican,
favors at least three counts of impeachment. Fellow Republican
Reps. Todd Tiahrt and Jim Ryun of Kansas also back some impeachment
articles.
</P>
<P>
   In Missouri, Rep. Karen McCarthy opposes impeachment. Rep. Ike
Skelton won't say where he stands.
</P>
<P>
   With the president's fate hanging in the balance, Danner is
feeling the heat.
</P>
<P>
   These days, she awakes often during the night, fretting about
the vote. She opens her eyes to see the yellow numbers from her
digital alarm clock projected through a prism on her bedroom
ceiling. 2:06 ... 3:37 ... 5:14. Danner is getting familiar with
the middle-of-the-night television lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Her matching living-room couches are crowded with briefing
papers, articles and books. A graduate of a speed-reading course,
Danner doubts that she can get through it all.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, she said, is the toughest she's had to cast since she
was elected to Congress in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing else comes close,'' Danner said.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, a simple majority of 218 votes on any of the four
impeachment articles is needed to send the measure to the Senate.
The full House will meet Thursday to begin weighing the articles.
</P>
<P>
   Already five Republicans, who hold a 228-206 edge over Democrats
in the House, have stated publicly that they oppose impeachment. On
the other side of the aisle, about half a dozen conservative
Democrats, including Danner and possibly Skelton, are possible
votes for it.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest bloc, however, is the cadre of moderate Republicans
who remained undecided heading into the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Both Danner and Skelton broke party ranks in October when they
voted with 29 other Democrats to authorize the impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't the first time Danner had stepped away from her
party. A member of the ``Blue Dogs,'' a group of conservative
Democrats known for seeking bipartisan solutions to tough problems,
Danner is seen as an independent thinker.
</P>
<P>
   On this issue, she asserts that her vote will be a matter of
conscience, not something dictated to her by party bosses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I listen to what people say, but I make up my own mind,''
Danner said.
</P>
<P>
   During an interview over lunch Thursday, Danner offered her most
passionate arguments for the do-not-impeach position. She openly
fretted about the effect of an impeachment trial on the Senate,
where more routine business could be backlogged for months.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd cripple government for a year,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court could be similarly affected. Chief Justice
William Rehnquist would oversee the Senate trial, forcing the court
to also delay its work.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know for what time period we'd be looking at,''
Danner said. ``No one really knows how all of this would work.''
</P>
<P>
   She expressed concerns over how a prolonged impeachment trial
would affect Clinton, who faces an array of international problems
ranging from the activities of Iraqi strongman Saddam Hussein to
the world economic crisis to Russia's internal turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   In what might be another hint at how she will vote, Danner said
Republican leaders should allow members to vote on a congressional
censure, a formal reprimand. GOP leaders so far have resisted,
insisting on a straight up or down vote on impeachment. But if a
compromise censure option is made available, the ability to pass an
impeachment measure might falter.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, Danner bridled at the notion of the president
having a relationship with a subordinate, a practice that raises
questions of sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've certainly seen what happens in the military, even if you
have an affair that is very old, many years in the past,'' she
noted. ``It can destroy your military career.''
</P>
<P>
   Her vote on the impeachment inquiry in October is viewed as a
sign of her deep dissatisfaction with the president's actions.
</P>
<P>
   The issue, Danner said, is deeply serious in some ways and
sublimely ridiculous in others.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the yin and the yang,'' she said. ``That's what makes it
so difficult.'' MORE
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ it so difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Danner is undecided, she has received few lobbying
calls from fellow Democrats. Vice President Al Gore didn't contact
her when he was in Kansas City recently, although he discussed how
Danner might vote with other Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   House Democratic Leader Richard Gephardt hasn't phoned, nor has
Clinton, although a lobbyist close to the president left a
telephone message. Danner didn't call back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel like I needed to be lobbied by a Washington
attorney,'' Danner said.
</P>
<P>
   The president did reach out in another way, though. In
September, the White House extended a prized state-dinner
invitation to Danner, her first, when Czech President Vaclav Havel
visited Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Danner remembers the night vividly. She and her husband were
seated separately. Danner was directed to Table 14 in the East
Room.
</P>
<P>
   When she arrived, she looked over the place cards at her
circular table. Henry Kissinger. Kurt Vonnegut. The wife of the
Czech leader. And finally, Mr. President and to his immediate left,
The Honorable Pat Danner.
</P>
<P>
   During a long evening of dining on scrumptious creations that
meld together in Danner's memory, she had the president's almost
undivided attention. Havel's wife, who sat to the president's right
and spoke little English, spent most of her time talking to the
multilingual Kissinger.
</P>
<P>
   Danner and Clinton talked about children, family, Arkansas and
how people around Little Rock sometimes top their barbecue
sandwiches with cole slaw.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington business, including the Lewinsky matter, never
surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt it would have been inappropriate,'' Danner said. ``He
is a delightful dinner companion. You wouldn't have thought there
was one thing wrong in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The congresswoman thinks the seating arrangement was
intentional. The president knew she might be a swing vote on
impeachment. So, did it work?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever my vote may be, it won't be based on knowing him, but
on the evidence as I see it,'' Danner said. ``He has his job to do,
and I have my job to do.''

COUNCIL REJECTS AFRICAN CHURCH THAT ALLOWS POLYGAMY AMONG CLERGY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARARE, Zimbabwe _ As an organization dedicated to promoting
Christian unity, the World Council of Churches has been a fairly
spacious body for those who would affirm the fundamentals of the
Christian faith. But over the past week, the Council has found
itself in the unusual position of balking at accepting a new
member.
</P>
<P>
   The resulting controversy illustrates the challenges facing the
council as it attempts to keep the global ecumenical movement alive
by occasionally reaching beyond its traditional Protestant and
Orthodox Christian base to include independent churches in the
developing world, where much of Christianity's growth is occurring.
</P>
<P>
   Founded 50 years ago with 147 member churches, primarily from
Europe and North America, the council has more than doubled its
membership to 339 since then, adding denominations from Africa,
Latin America and Asia, and now claiming to represent more than 300
million Christians worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   But here in Zimbabwe's capital city, at the organization's
Eighth Assembly since its founding, the council declined to accept
a new member because of questions over that church's policy on
allowing clergy to have more than one wife.
</P>
<P>
   The church in question is the Celestial Church of Christ,
founded in 1947 in Nigeria by a Methodist lay man, S.B.J. Oshoffa,
who reported receiving a vision of an angel who instructed him to
teach people to trust in Jesus.
</P>
<P>
   The church holds that the Bible is inerrant, and, according to
members, teaches that prayer can effect physical healing and that
members can prophesy under divine inspiration. (The church derives
its hymns from the words of those who have been so inspired.)
Claiming between 5 million and 6 million followers worldwide,
including in the United States, it is one of what are called the
``African-instituted churches,'' organizations without any direct
ties to the European missionaries of the late 19th and early 20th
centuries.
</P>
<P>
   When nearly 1,000 assembly delegates gathered here on Dec. 3,
they faced membership applications from nine religious
organizations, including the Celestial Church, all endorsed by the
council's executive committee. Eight were admitted during a session
two days later, among them another African-instituted church, the
Harrist Church, based in the Ivory Coast. But a decision on the
Celestial Church's application was deferred.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the Rev. Alexander Bada, the church's supreme head,
published a policy statement saying that ``the question of
polygamy'' among converts to the church ``was not seriously
addressed'' until after the death of Oshoffa in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1986, Bada's statement said, the church has held to a
``firm and irreversible'' policy of refusing to ordain anyone who
has more than one wife. But, he said, to avoid splitting the flock
and being seen to endorse divorce, it has not asked that polygamous
priests ordained before 1986 give up their additional wives.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, a clergy member in the church, Senior
Evangelist Olantunji Akande, said the church's leaders did not feel
they could ask polygamous clergy members to retire, because they
believed that God had called those men to serve. Akande said the
church also believed that divorce, even in a polygamous marriage,
``would go against the law of God, who said, `I detest divorce.' ''
</P>
<P>
   He said the council should look at the 1986 policy, which ``put
the church back on to the path of rectitude.''
</P>
<P>
   But last Thursday, the assembly, reconsidering the application,
voted to reject it by a 3-to-2 margin.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the issue has not been laid to rest. Speaking before the
assembly late Saturday afternoon, the council's general secretary,
the Rev. Konrad Raiser, said the vote was ruled invalid after a
delegate challenged the way it had been taken. Raiser said no new
vote would be taken at the assembly, which concludes on Monday, but
that the church's application for membership would be referred back
to the council's central committee.

<TEXT>
<P>
   When David Farber stepped down from the public stage of the
witness stand in the Microsoft antitrust trial last Wednesday after
two days of testimony, he found his own private audience eagerly
awaiting his return. And he did not disappoint them.
</P>
<P>
   Logging on hours after returning from Washington to his home in
Landenburg, Pa., the 64-year-old University of Pennsylvania
telecommunications professor dispatched an e-mail message. ``To all
those who I have ignored,'' the subject line read. The text of the
message went on to say, ``I have never felt so drained.''
</P>
<P>
   In Farber's case, ``To all'' refers to a sprawling network of
25,000 Internet users who have maneuvered themselves onto his
formidable mailing list over the last decade. His list _ which he
calls IP, for ``interesting people'' _has a devoted following among
the digerati, as well as less technological types. And it gives him
unrivaled, if unofficial, influence as a voice of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   That status helps explain why the Justice Department chose
Farber as an expert witness for a trial in which a central question
is whether Microsoft tried to monopolize the market in Internet
browser software.
</P>
<P>
   As master of the IP list, Farber typically exercises his opinion
almost solely through a selection process in which he forwards
three or four items culled from hundreds of information sources
that he deems most worthy of attention each day. At most, he may
add a one-line precis, as he did with a simple ``Bye bye liberty''
atop a mailing last month citing an Army Times article about the
government's expanded antiterrorism surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   But in last week's post-courtroom e-mail message, he allowed
himself more room for introspection.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am endlessly astonished that all too often the trials seem
not to be interested in extracting the truth,'' Farber wrote, after
a difficult day of cross-examination by Microsoft's lawyer, Steven
Holley. ``Oh well.''
</P>
<P>
   Appearing at a trial that has been dominated by software company
executives, Farber was the first technologist to testify without an
obvious ax to grind or damning e-mail record to refute. His
testimony focused on defining the technical terms that are at the
core of the dispute: whether Microsoft illegally used its monopoly
in the personal computer operating system market to give an unfair
advantage to the company's browser software, Internet Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   Farber argued that software was ``infinitely malleable'' and
that Microsoft had designed its Windows 98 operating system so that
consumers could not remove Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft dismissed Farber's testimony as ``nothing more than an
opinion piece on how he thinks Microsoft could have or should have
designed Windows.'' But it was an opinion that had a definite
appeal among a large segment of Internet users.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet reaction was like, `Ah-hah, there's our guy,'''
said Esther Dyson, editor of Release 1.0, an influential industry
newsletter, and chief of an international governing agency for
assigning Internet addresses. ``The trial has centered on the
Internet, but it's all been about the corporations of the Internet.
It was nice to finally have the users and creators represented in
the courtroom, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some of those rooting for Microsoft found cause to applaud
Farber's appearance, including Scott Bradner, a senior technical
consultant at Harvard University. Bradner was in Orlando, Fla.,
last week at an annual meeting of the Internet Engineering Task
Force, an industry association. He said the 2,000 technology
enthusiasts at the conference seemed of mixed opinion about the
Microsoft trial. But he said he and many others were glad that
Farber, a longtime member of the group, had taken the stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are more and more examples of where technical reality
has to be reconciled with the law,'' Bradner said. ``It's important
for objective reporters of technology to be able to explain it to
judges and juries in a way they can understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Farber is a bald, grandfatherly figure whose tendency to round
his Rs into Ws finds him affectionately compared to Elmer Fudd. But
it is a demeanor belying a distinguished resume.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in Jersey City, N.J., holds a master's degree in
mathematics from the Stevens Institute of Technology, and helped
invent the first electronic telephone switch in the early '60s as
an engineer at Bell Laboratories. It was there that he also
concocted the computer language Snobol and met his wife, GG, before
moving to Southern California and helping to organize the Internet.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He has been at the University of Pennsylvania since 1989. In
addition to teaching a course there on computer ethics and society
this term, Farber has been a technical consultant for Intel Corp.
and the Internet service provider Earthlink, among others. He
serves on the Presidential Advisory Committee on High Performance
Computing and Communications, and sits on the board of the
nonprofit Electronic Frontier Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   But he said in an interview last week that ``the IP list has
made me the most famous.''
</P>
<P>
   The list began about 11 years ago, when Farber's friend Eric
Bloch started a demanding job at the National Science Foundation
and complained that he no longer had time to read news, on the
Internet or anywhere else. Farber began forwarding items to Bloch
and then to others.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, the list became to the technology elite what an invitation
to Irving (Swifty) Lazar's Oscar party once was to Hollywood's
glitterati _ the industry's place to be. And by now, the IP list is
widely considered the single most influential source of relevant
and up-to-date news about all dimensions of the technological
world.
</P>
<P>
   When Jon Postel, an Internet founder and a former PhD student of
Farber's, died unexpectedly last month, for instance, IPers learned
about it before anyone else. Word came through a posting by Farber
that was followed by a eulogy from Vint Cerf, a longtime associate
who is now senior vice president at MCI Worldcom and chairman of
the Internet Society, a professional group.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Farber said he had enlarged and diversified the
list, including homemakers and students who had requested to be
added to a group of recipients that also includes Intel's chairman,
Andrew Grove, and many leading technology journalists.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has many mailing lists _ 90,095 by one count _ but
Farber's may reflect more than any other the power of
distributed-information networks. As he adds subscribers to the
list, each becomes an additional source of information. And Farber
performs the function of a trusted filter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has become a social node in a network of people,'' said
David Bennahum, a subscriber to the list and author of a new book,
``Extralife,'' about growing up with computers. ``He helped form
the Internet socially by connecting all these important people
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Even human network nodes have to rest sometimes, though. Late
last week, Farber posted what may be one of his final messages of
the year to the IP list:
</P>
<P>
   ``After Sunday IP will be off the air and so will I for 10 days
as I go off to a place in Hawaii where there are no phones, no
radios, no TVs etc. and certainly no EMAIL,'' he wrote. ``Have a
good Hanukkah and a Merry Christmas etc.''

<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ It's Oscar time in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   In a vote that could foreshadow next year's Academy Awards, the
Los Angeles Film Critics Association on Saturday night named
``Saving Private Ryan'' best picture of the year and Steven
Spielberg, who made the film, best director.
</P>
<P>
   The best actress award was a tie: Fernanda Montenegro, for the
Brazilian drama ``Central Station,'' and Ally Sheedy, who played a
once-famous photographer living as a recluse in the independent
drama ``High Art.'' Ms. Montenegro, one of Brazil's foremost stage
actresses, plays a bitter elderly woman who takes a motherless boy
under her wing.
</P>
<P>
   Named best actor by the 49-member group was Ian McKellen for his
role as the ``Frankenstein'' director James Whale in the
independent film ``Gods and Monsters.''
</P>
<P>
   Best supporting actor was also a tie: Billy Bob Thornton, for
his role as one of three men in ``A Simple Plan'' who find a downed
airplane with a fortune in cash, and to Bill Murray for two quirky
roles, a businessman in the comedy ``Rushmore'' and a low-rent
lawyer in the drama ``Wild Things.''
</P>
<P>
   The supporting actress award went to Joan Allen, who plays a
woman who transforms herself in the comedy-drama ``Pleasantville.''
</P>
<P>
   The association gave the best screenplay award to Warren Beatty
and Jeremy Pikser for the political satire ``Bulworth,'' in which
Beatty starred and directed.
</P>
<P>
   The best foreign film prize went to the Danish drama ``The
Celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   Within the next 10 days critics groups from New York, Chicago
and Boston weigh in with their choices in advance of the Academy
Awards. Oscar nominations are to be announced on Feb. 9, and the
awards given on March 21.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the National Board of Review named ``Gods and
Monsters'' and its star, McKellen, as best film and actor. Ms.
Montenegro was also named best actress, while the director's award
went to Shekhar Kapur for the historical drama ``Elizabeth.''
Supporting actress and actor awards were voted for Christina Ricci
for ``Buffalo 66,'' ``The Opposite of Sex'' and ``Pecker,'' and to
Ed Harris for ``The Truman Show'' and ``Stepmom.''
</P>
<P>
   While these groups sometimes foretell the Academy Awards, their
choices are not always followed. Last year, for example, numerous
critics groups named the police drama ``L.A. Confidential'' as best
film. But the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences voted in
favor of James Cameron's ``Titanic,'' which swept the Oscars.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts the race this year is not entirely predictable,
although ``Saving Private Ryan'' is viewed as almost certain to get
a nomination. Other films in the Oscar running include ``The Truman
Show,'' ``Life Is Beautiful,'' ``Pleasantville,'' ``Elizabeth,''
``Shakespeare in Love,'' ``A Simple Plan,'' ``Gods and Monsters''
and ``The Thin Red Line.''

MORRIS UDALL, FORMER LIBERAL CONSCIENCE OF THE HOUSE, DIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Colo., Mass., Ga., Calif., Alaska., Mich., Texas.,
N.Y., Mass., La., N.M., N.C., Okla., Va., N.H., Mont.)  (EDS: Shorter version is moving as OBIT-UDALL-ABR.)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Morris K. Udall of Arizona, a liberal conscience of the House of
Representatives for 30 years and a tireless advocate for
environmental protection and political reform, died late Saturday
in Washington. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   Udall died of complications arising from Parkinson's disease,
according to Terrence Bracy, chairman of the Morris K. Udall
Foundation in Tucson, Ariz. First diagnosed in 1980, the disease
led to Udall's resignation from Congress in 1991. He spent the
final stage of his life in a veterans hospital in Washington,
seldom conscious.
</P>
<P>
   Udall was one of those rare figures on the Washington scene who
flourished despite the fact that his politics frequently did not
square with the views held by many of his constituents, who were
known for their support of conservative issues and Sen. Barry
Goldwater. But from the time Udall was first elected in 1961 in
Arizona's 2nd Congressional District until his retirement, they
voted for him in overwhelming numbers and they did not seem to care
that he earned high marks from organizations like the Americans for
Democratic Action and the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   Arizonans identified with Udall's unabashed love of unspoiled
nature, and they applauded his efforts to create safeguards for the
environment, including curbs on strip mining and legislation to
protect more than 100 million acres of wilderness in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Udall's supporters came to believe in the 1970s that the
6-foot-5-inch, one-time basketball player for the Denver Nuggets
might be a viable candidate for president. Udall believed it, too,
hoping that his reputation for honesty and rugged integrity would
help him become the nation's first elected post-Watergate
president. But in 1976 he finished second in six Democratic
primaries, losing the nomination to Gov. Jimmy Carter of Georgia.
His liberal positions, among them proposals to break up the large
oil companies and to set up a national health insurance program,
were considered too extreme by some elements in his party and he
lacked the name recognition and money to finance his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Udall considered running again in 1980, because he did not
believe that Carter could defeat Ronald Reagan. But mindful of
questions about the state of his health, he threw his support to
Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. He had disclosed that he had
Parkinson's disease, a progressive disorder that typically occurs
in middle age or beyond and is often characterized by tremors,
stiffness of muscles and a deterioration of certain functions of
the brain. Despite his condition, Udall remained active in the
House for another decade.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, he continued to be in the vanguard of those who
insisted that the environment be protected from industry, opposing
oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. The
coastal plain of the refuge was thought to be especially rich in
oil but Udall, who served as chairman of the House Interior
Committee, called it ``a sacred place'' that should never be
invaded by oil rigs.
</P>
<P>
   He was also a leader in the fight to push a tough strip-mining
bill through the House in the 1970s. The bill was vetoed twice by
President Gerald Ford before it passed in 1977 and became one of
the pioneering pieces of environmental legislation, reclaiming
millions of acres of coal land.
</P>
<P>
   In his years in Congress he was in the forefront of efforts to
protect the environment, expand the national parks system and
restructure the energy industry; in recognition, the National
Wildlife Federation named him its legislator of the year in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963 he proposed legislation to put cigarettes and other
tobacco products under the control of the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration. He favored putting the federal government on a
pay-as-you-go basis and slashing the federal debt, and he promoted
major legislation in postal reform and land-use planning.
</P>
<P>
   He worked overtime to reform the way the House does business.
From the start he disclosed his finances and put his income tax
returns in open files. He gave up his lucrative law practice
entirely and did not keep outside sources of income, as do many
congressmen. He fought for financial disclosure legislation and
campaign-reform laws. He proposed curbs on lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   He played a key role in drafting and passing the Federal
Election Campaign Act of 1971, the first substantial revision of
campaign financing laws since 1925. The law, which required
candidates for federal office to file detailed reports on the money
they raised and spent, was used to help expose the Watergate
scandal in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Udall also took on the powerful committee chairmen who
controlled Congress under the seniority system. He wanted to break
up the old-boy network by allowing the top three ranking members on
each House committee to be eligible for the chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Morris King Udall was born June 15, 1922, in St. John's, Ariz.,
the son of Levi and Louise Lee Udall. One of his great-grandfathers
had led the first Mormons into Arizona from Utah. His father
started out digging ditches, achieved success as a farmer, took
law-school correspondence courses and served for 16 years on the
Arizona Supreme Court, for a part of that time as its highly
regarded chief justice. Udall's mother was the author of ``Mine and
Me,'' the story of a Hopi woman's life.
</P>
<P>
   Levi Udall stressed to his children the need for responsible
people to enter public service. Morris had two brothers and two
sisters. One of his brothers, Stewart, was elected to Congress from
Arizona's 2nd Congressional District and served until he resigned
to become secretary of the interior in the Cabinet of President
John F. Kennedy. ``Stew's little brother'' Mo won the special
election to fill his seat.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy, Mo Udall had more than his share of adversity. When he
was 5, his right eye was accidentally injured by a playmate. At
that point, Levi Udall was still struggling and did not have enough
money to obtain decent medical care for his son. Morris Udall later
recalled being taken to a doctor in St. John's who, he said, was
``mostly drunk'' and who recommended that the eye be treated with
poultices. Soon, the eye became infected and it was lost. Udall
said the experience help mold his sense of social consciousness and
he fought for the right of all Americans to consult with qualified
physicians without respect to their ability to pay.
</P>
<P>
   When in later life Udall talked about any of his problems, it
was always with self-deprecating wit and no illness could change
that. ``I'm a one-eyed Mormon Democrat from conservative Arizona
and you can't have a higher handicap than that,'' he would say.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   After graduation from high school in 1940, Udall entered the
University of Arizona, but after the United States entered World
War II, he maneuvered his way into the Army despite the loss of his
eye. In fact, he recalled, it was at Fort Sam Houston that he got
his first decent glass eye; it not only fitted, but the color
matched, as well.
</P>
<P>
   He served as commander of an all-black squadron in Louisiana for
two years. ``That really shaped my life,'' he later said. ``I
fought their fights with them. We had some battles over local
discrimination.'' He served in the South Pacific and achieved the
rank of captain in the Army Air Corps.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, he returned to the University of Arizona, where he was
voted president of the student body and starred as co-captain and
all-conference forward with the basketball team. After completing
his undergraduate work, he played briefly with the Denver Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   But his athletic career was set aside in 1949, after his
admission to the bar. He returned to Arizona, set up a law practice
with his brother Stewart and entered politics. He was elected chief
deputy attorney for Pima County in 1950 and three years later was
elected county attorney. He suffered a setback in 1954 when he
failed to win a nomination for a Superior Court judgeship. But in
1961, he succeeded his brother in Congress and became a leading
liberal voice there for the next three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Larry King, the writer, once described the lanky Udall's arrival
at the Capitol: ``There was about him a disconcerting combination
of painful country-boy shyness and a bawdy cow-lot humor.''
</P>
<P>
   Udall prided himself on his independence and outspokenness. In
1967, he broke with colleagues in the House who wanted to unseat
Rep. Adam Clayton Powell, D-N.Y. Udall said it would be an
injustice to Powell's constituents. That same year, he returned to
hawkish Arizona and made a speech in Tucson in which he said he had
erred in supporting American involvement in the war in Vietnam. His
experiences in World War II led him to cease being an active member
of the Mormon church. Citing a church prohibition on blacks'
entering its priesthood, he said, ``For more than 25 years I have
held an expressed a deep-seated and conscientious disagreement with
the church doctrine on the role of blacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, Udall was always regarded as a formidable
parliamentary tactician and an astute politician. But he failed in
his efforts to oust John McCormack of Massachusetts as speaker of
the House in 1969, when McCormack was 77 and tiring but still too
formidable for anyone else to dare challenge him. And he failed
also in a bid in 1970 to oust Hale Boggs of Louisiana as House
majority leader. When he lost to Boggs, after promised support from
some liberals failed to materialize, he turned his ``Mo'' campaign
button upside down so it read ``Ow.''
</P>
<P>
   Udall was married to Patricia Emery from 1949 until their
divorce in 1966. They had six children: Mark, Randolph, Judith,
Anne, Bradley and Katherine. He married Ella Royston in 1968. She
committed suicide 20 years later. In 1989, he married Norma
Gilbert. He is survived by his wife; four brothers and sisters,
Stewart of Santa Fe, N.M., David of Tucson, Elma of Albuquerque,
N.M., and Eloise Whiting of Albuquerque; six children, Mark of
Boulder, Colo., Randolph of Carbondale, Colo., Judith Udall Harding
of Boulder, Anne Udall of Charlotte, N.C., Bradley of Eagle, Colo.,
and Katherine Udall of Norman, Okla., and seven grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Udall resigned from the House after a fall in his home in
Arlington, Va., in 1991. But he had decided even before that, he
said, that he could not be a candidate for office in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In his honor, Congress in 1992 established the Morris K. Udall
Foundation, which is dedicated to environmental education and
mediation.
</P>
<P>
   Before illness took its toll, Udall liked to write and took
pleasure in creating his own newsletters to his constituents. Some
of his newsletters, which were distinctive because they were devoid
of self-promotion and concentrated on voter education, were
published in book form in 1972 under the title, ``The Education of
a Congressman.'' His witticisms were the subject of another book,
``Too Funny to be President,'' published after his unsuccessful bid
for president in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Udall's humor was appreciated in Washington and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the House Post Office Committee, he would joke:
``Let's turn inflation over to the Post Office. That'll slow it
down.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was running his modest campaign for the Democratic
presidential nomination, he told audiences of the time he stopped
in a barbershop in New Hampshire, announced who he was and what he
was running for, and was told by a patron, ``Yep, we were just
laughing about that yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   He enjoyed telling stories to his friends, and when in the final
stage of his illness he fell mostly silent, it was an agonizing
loss for his friends. ``You'd tell him a joke and his eyes would
twinkle as he prepared to tell you two back _ but he couldn't get
them out,'' said Rep. Pat Williams, a Democrat of Montana. Still,
his friends remembered that even after he got Parkinson's disease
and realized how serious it was, he joked about it. Indeed, he
suggested there was a similarity between his disease and Paula
Parkinson, a lobbyist who was involved in one of Washington's
periodic sex scandals. ``They both cause you to lose sleep,'' he
said, ``and they both give you the shakes.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the disease progressed Udall was confined to the veterans
hospital in Washington. Michael Lewis , a columnist for The New
York Times Magazine, found that Sen. John McCain, the conservative
Republican from Arizona, was one of Udall's few visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mo reached out to me in 50 different ways,'' McCain told
Lewis. When McCain was elected to the House in 1982, he said, Udall
took the young congressman in hand although they did not think
alike on many issues. Four years later, when McCain won the Senate
seat surrendered by a retiring Barry Goldwater, he felt his deepest
sense of gratitude not to his fellow conservative but to Udall.
</P>
<P>
   ``There no way Mo could have been more wonderful,'' McCain told
Lewis, ``And there was no reason for him to be that way.'' Whenever
he takes the Senate floor on behalf of American Indians or argues
that the Republican Party should support environmentalism, McCain
said, he remembers his debt to Mo Udall.

vanished from the Grand Banks due to overfishing and are equally as

are Pacific or ``true'' cod, which are smaller and lack the
slightly sweet taste of the Atlantic variety.

ANALYSIS: IF MICROSOFT LOSES CASE, REMEDIES ARE THORNY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the Microsoft trial, witness after witness for the government
has described the big software company's industry-standard Windows
operating system as the essential utility of modern computing.
</P>
<P>
   To succeed in the marketplace, they explain, a new software
product must have access to Microsoft Corp.'s technology if the
product is to run smoothly on top of the Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Even a rival like Netscape Communications Corp., the Internet
browser pioneer, must ask for Microsoft's cooperation so that it
can compete against Microsoft _ a situation created by Microsoft's
broad reach across so many software and Internet commerce markets,
from spreadsheets to online travel services.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has depicted Microsoft as unfairly using
the technical leverage and market power that stems from its 90
percent share of the operating-system market to stifle competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``The case is fundamentally about access,'' said William
Kovacic, an antitrust expert at the George Washington University
Law School. ``Microsoft is accused, figuratively, of saying again
and again that you can't set foot on our bridge unless you agree to
the following conditions. If not, the company is left dangling with
one foot off the bridge or told to learn to swim.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet while the case raises the issue of access to technology, it
also shows that doing anything to force Microsoft to provide access
to its technology will be tricky, on both legal and practical
grounds.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, Justice Department lawyers have declared
Microsoft to be a monopoly at every opportunity. But they have
never once called it an ``essential facility'' _ a legal theory
that the courts have been reluctant to apply beyond regulated
monopolies like railroads, electric utilities and telephone
networks.
</P>
<P>
   The doctrine dates to 1912, when the Supreme Court ruled against
a group of railroads, led by a turn-of-the-century robber baron,
Jay Gould, that denied competitors access to a bridge on the
Mississippi River.
</P>
<P>
   But the government will almost certainly have to deal with the
issue of technology access if it wins the Microsoft case and asks
the court to order remedial action.
</P>
<P>
   Antitrust experts observing the trial say that at least at the
U.S. District Court level, the government seems likely to win _
based on Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's actions, from giving the
Justice Department plenty of leeway to broaden its case with
last-minute evidence to remarking that Bill Gates, the Microsoft
chairman, ``has not been particularly responsive'' in his
videotaped deposition.
</P>
<P>
   In a related case last year, Jackson ruled against Microsoft,
though he was overruled by an appeals court last June.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department will not discuss possible remedies until
the case is over. Still, the government is stepping up its efforts
to try to devise an effective remedial plan. Joel Klein, the
assistant attorney general who heads the Justice Department's
antitrust division, has asked Timothy Bresnahan, an economics
professor at Stanford University, to study the options for
remedies, according to a person close to the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Bresnahan, known for his rigorous statistical studies of
industry structure and markets, is co-director of the Stanford
Computer Industry Project, a research program whose corporate
sponsors include Microsoft. He will be one of several experts
advising Klein on remedies. Daniel Rubinfeld, the chief economist
of the antitrust division, plans to leave the Justice Department at
the end of this year, but he will remain a consultant on the
Microsoft case.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the role of the economic and legal experts counseling the
Justice Department is mainly to present a set of options to Klein.
And although the White House does not get involved in the Justice
Department's investigations or decisions to file suits, it could
weigh in on the remedies issue.
</P>
<P>
   An effort by the Justice Department, for example, to try to
break up Microsoft or force the company to open up access to its
operating-system technology could well be a major economic policy
decision. Whether the government seeks sweeping or more limited
remedies will depend on how great the finding of liability is, if
any, against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   In the trial, the subject of access to Microsoft's technology is
typically raised in terms of a seemingly arcane three-letter
acronym _ API, for application program interface. APIs are the
software hooks that any program, from spreadsheets to games to
Internet browsers, must use to run smoothly on top of the operating
system, which controls the basic operations of a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every government witness has discussed APIs and has tried
to offer Jackson a nontechnical translation. ``You can think of
these interfaces as connectors, as a socket in a wall, like the
ones you put a plug in for electricity,'' Dr. James Gosling, a vice
president of Sun Microsystems Inc., explained to the judge last
week.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The issue of access to Microsoft's APIs is at the root of the
government's case. Because Microsoft knows where every one of those
plugs is _ and how each one works _ competitors complain that it
has an enormous advantage over other developers in designing
software that will run seamlessly on Windows.
</P>
<P>
   It was to gain access to Microsoft's APIs that Netscape says it
met with Microsoft on June 21, 1995. Two days after that meeting,
responding to a government inquiry, Netscape's outside counsel,
Gary Reback, wrote to the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   At the June meeting, he stated, ``Microsoft indicated it would
not provide this information to Netscape unless Microsoft gets an
equity interest in Netscape, a seat on Netscape's board of
directors, and otherwise controls Netscape's ability to compete
against Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft denied the allegation, saying that Netscape and the
government had distorted a fairly routine meeting in the software
business, where companies often cooperate in some areas and compete
in others. ``There is no proof in the record that Microsoft denied
Netscape anything,'' said Charles Rule, a former senior Justice
Department official who is an adviser to Microsoft. ``The
government simply doesn't have a denial-of-access case.''
</P>
<P>
   Tackling the issue of open access to Microsoft's technology is
crucial to loosening the company's choke hold on the industry, said
Ken Wasch, president of the Software Publishers Association, a
trade group. ``Any remedy that doesn't in some way deal with access
to APIs won't have much of an impact,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But those software interfaces are Microsoft's intellectual
property, and having the government police the distribution of them
to other companies runs the risk of becoming a regulatory
nightmare. A few months ago, a senior Justice Department official
said emphatically, ``I don't want to get into the business of
having to be the arbiter of whether Microsoft has released every
new set of Windows APIs on a timely basis.''
</P>
<P>
   There could, however, be ways to limit the government's
oversight role. Justice Department officials did take note of the
announcement last week by Sun to open up the development of Java,
its Internet programming language. It announced that the accounting
firm Pricewaterhouse Coopers would audit the specification and
would guarantee fair, impartial distribution of Java APIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``A behavioral remedy that requires some monitoring of access to
technology does take you down a regulatory path, but it could be
workable,'' said Carl Shapiro, an economist at the University of
California at Berkeley who is a former Justice Department official.

CARNEGIE HALL TO EXPAND WITH UNDERGROUND PERFORMANCE SPACE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a major expansion of one of the nation's premier
cultural landmarks, Carnegie Hall is going underground, turning a
subterranean recital hall from 1891 into a high-tech performance
space for small operas and other productions.
</P>
<P>
   The new hall would contain an orchestra pit and about 800 seats
and would be one of the most significant additions to New York
City's music scene since the construction of Lincoln Center in the
'60s. It could be in operation as early as the 2000-2001 season.
</P>
<P>
   Music people who have spoken to the architect, James Stewart
Polshek, say the project could end up costing as much as $50
million because of the awkward location and constraints of working
around performance schedules. About $20 million has been raised or
promised, about a third from public sources _ New York City owns
the hall _ and the rest from private donors, officials said. The
space was used as a movie theater from 1960 until last year.
</P>
<P>
   Several public officials involved in the project said the new
hall would be designed with the latest in broadcast, communications
and recording technology. Its size would be particularly attractive
to many arts groups, especially those that present Baroque and
chamber opera productions and find it hard to fill larger quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The hall would be the third in the building, the ocher
Italianate palazzo on Seventh Avenue and 57th Street that the steel
baron Andrew Carnegie built for less than $1 million starting in
1889. Despite its reputation, it barely escaped demolition before
being saved in 1960.
</P>
<P>
   The main concert hall has 2,804 seats, and the adjacent Weill
Recital Hall seats 268. The underground space, which opened some
months before the main hall in 1891, was a 1,200-seat privately run
movie house until 1997, when Carnegie Hall reclaimed it, along with
a shoe store and a poster gallery on Seventh Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Another large music hall, a home for Jazz at Lincoln Center,
with 1,000 seats, is to be built at Columbus Center at Columbus
Circle, where the Coliseum now stands.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Arron, Carnegie Hall's executive director, said last
January that plans for a hall were under discussion but ``still in
the dreaming stage.'' In the meantime, Polshek's architectural
firm, which designed the $60 million renovation of Carnegie Hall in
the '80s as well as projects at the American Museum of Natural
History and Symphony Space, was engaged to plan the redevelopment
of the underground hall.
</P>
<P>
   The project was discussed at a patrons' dinner in October, and
last week Carnegie Hall sent out to reporters and others elaborate
cardboard invitations for a Jan. 11 announcement of ``The Third
Stage, an expansion campaign for Carnegie Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Wada, a spokeswoman for Carnegie Hall, said the
invitations did not constitute an announcement and declined to
provide information on the project. Sanford Weill, the hall's
chairman and co-chairman of Citigroup, also declined to be
interviewed. The office of Polshek, the architect, referred
questions to Carnegie Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Officials familiar with the plans said the hall would be
designed with the latest technology and the flexibility to upgrade
equipment as advances occur. It would also be equipped with what
one called ``a high-tech center for cultural learning outreach,''
connecting students at Carnegie Hall with counterparts worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   The project has won pledges of financial support from City Hall,
Gov. George Pataki and the state Senate, officials said. Since the
violinist Isaac Stern rallied artists and other supporters in
rescuing Carnegie Hall from the wreckers' ball, it has been one of
the 34 city-owned cultural institutions directly supported in the
city budget. Stern is the hall's president.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the project has not been spelled out, but the work
presents so many difficulties that the Metropolitan Transportation
Authority was approached to allow removal of construction debris
through the subway system. Scheduling the demolition and rebuilding
around the full program of concerts, recitals and rehearsals is
also problematic.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Representatives of music ensembles and soloists said they had
not been contacted by Carnegie Hall for bookings in the new space,
but many said it would fill an important niche.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any new facility is a great opportunity for all of us who are
still looking for the perfect hall in New York,'' said David
Foster, president of ICM Artists, a leading management agency. A
new midsize hall would attract new productions, he said, adding,
``If you build it, they will come.''
</P>
<P>
   Other arts managers said that a hall of the kind envisioned by
Carnegie Hall would be perfect for rarely performed quasi-operatic
and chamber works by Stravinsky, Schoenberg, Rameau and Couperin,
and could attract groups like the French early-music ensemble Les
Arts Florissants and the kind of small opera productions that
distinguished the Glyndebourne Festival in England in the days
before its hall was expanded to 1,800 seats. Many of the more
experimental music companies now perform at the Brooklyn Academy of
Music and at the three-week summertime Lincoln Center Festival.
</P>
<P>
   The city has a number of midsize music halls _ among them
Florence Gould Hall, the 92nd Street Y, the Sylvia and Danny Kaye
Playhouse at Hunter College and the Juilliard Theater _ but none as
technically advanced as the planned Carnegie Hall complex.
</P>
<P>
   Large halls like the Metropolitan Opera's, with its 3,800 seats,
are ill suited to less than spectacles, and the Met itself has long
been playing with the idea of finding a smaller arena for ``mini
Met'' productions. Joseph Volpe, the Met's general manager, said he
had not yet talked to Ms. Arron about any collaborations.
</P>
<P>
   The underground space, known to two generations of moviegoers
for its art films, plush scarlet seats and neo-classical columns,
has a venerable history predating the main hall's.
</P>
<P>
   Completed in early 1891 while the construction upstairs was
still going on _ loudly _ it played host to eminent musicians who
performed the works of contemporaries like Brahms. In 1896, the
American Academy of Dramatic Arts moved into the underground hall,
and for the next 58 years instructors, including David Belasco and
Charles Frohman, taught the actors' art to eager students,
including Edward G. Robinson, Rosalind Russell and Spencer Tracy.

<P>
   NEW BRITAIN, Conn. _ Paul J. Manafort, a former mayor here in
the hometown of Rep. Nancy L. Johnson, hoped to help shape his
fellow Republican's vote on whether to impeach President Clinton.
Manafort, a mentor when she started in local politics 25 years ago,
insists that the president committed perjury when he used language
so tortured ``he makes Yogi Berra look like an English professor.''
</P>
<P>
   But the last thing Manafort would do is call Mrs. Johnson. ``She
looks at the commas and the dots and has a mind of her own,'' he
said. ``If you try to tell her what to do, you're not on her list
no more.'' So instead, Manafort, 75, passed his views around the
Elks lodge and drugstore, hoping they would get back to her.
</P>
<P>
   And so went the tricky and _ according to the participants,
probably futile _ enterprise of trying to lobby Mrs. Johnson, whose
staff said she was still weighing her vote today. She is a moderate
Republican who represents a largely Democratic district, which has
sometimes made for a lonely road at home and on the Hill, but which
makes her a much-courted player on close votes. ``Conservatives
call her a liberal, and liberals call her a conservative,'' said
Thomas J. Meskill, a Republican who was the governor of Connecticut
from 1971 to 1975 and once held Mrs. Johnson's seat in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   One way to escape arm-twisting is to go on a fact-finding trip
to Australia and New Zealand, which Mrs. Johnson did last week. The
calls about impeachment poured in to her offices at about 200 a day
last week, initially two-thirds of them in favor but becoming more
balanced as the week passed, according to her staff. The nuances of
her views were so closely held that the letters piled up without
even a form response until after she announced her view.
</P>
<P>
   The Sixth District includes Democratic strongholds like New
Britain, an immigrant town 50 years past its manufacturing heyday
as ``The Hardware City,'' but stretches northwest to the luscious
weekend retreats of Litchfield County. Mrs. Johnson, 63, who has
represented the area since 1983, is known at home as an independent
idealist. In Washington, she shows her genes as the daughter of a
Chicago politician by cutting savvy deals with Republican leaders,
whom she has supported at crucial junctures.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republican activists in the district pressured her to vote
for impeachment. ``I told her Washington office that there's many
members of our committee that will not support her if she doesn't
vote for impeachment,'' said David R. Moulton, the Republican town
chairman of Barkhamsted. ``I know she's got the big cities to worry
about, but in the small towns we're watching her closely.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa R. Carver, a member of the Republican State Central
Committee, said she suspects that with new Republican leaders
taking over the House in January, Mrs. Johnson will want to break
from the pack to win deference. But Ms. Carver said she hoped Mrs.
Johnson would pick some other issue for that, and vote to impeach.
``This one has to come from your gut, not from your head,'' Ms.
Carver said.
</P>
<P>
   The opposite advice poured out Saturday night from New Britain
High School parents who gathered for a medieval-themed banquet
staged by the school's madrigal choir. The students played roles
like ``Lady Linda Who Trips'' for a play in which King Henry VIII,
accused of killing his wives, asks, ``What do you mean by murder?''
During the prime-rib feast, ``Sir Ken of Starr'' bustled among the
tables, taking notes on the diners.
</P>
<P>
   Even as their sons and daughters mocked the president, most of
their parents expressed visceral opposition to impeachment. ``I
feel like I have no representation _ it's frightening,'' said Cathy
Kellar, 48, a clinical social worker. ``Congress is just digging
its hole deeper.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard E. Rosol, 48, an English professor, said Republicans in
Congress seem to resent the president's success. ``Their
vindictiveness has given birth to self-righteousness,'' he said.
Just then, a male student wearing a blue dress and a beret crossed
the stage chanting, ``Pizza for Bill! Pizza for Bill!''

<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. _ Just as Rep. Bill Redmond faces one of the
most crucial votes of his brief career in Congress, the New Mexico
Republican has seen the number of telephone lines in his office
plummet from one dozen to one.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a debate on Thursday on the impeachment of President
Clinton, Redmond is deprived of the standard gauge of public
opinion _ the tally of constituent telephone calls. After losing
last month's election to Tom Udall, a Democrat, Redmond closed his
offices in Santa Fe and in Washington. And he was downgraded last
week to a cubicle in a basement room for lame-duck congressmen.
There, he said he works with a desk, a computer ``without a
printer'' and one telephone with an answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   But impeachment should not be decided by opinion polls,
cautioned Redmond, one of several dozen representatives who have
not announced how they will vote on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything characterizes my approach to the decision I will
make Thursday, it is that I am very dispassionate about it, I am
hyperrational,'' Redmond, a 44-year-old political conservative,
said Saturday over a bottle of a root beer in a doughnut shop here.
``You don't draw all your hypothesis until you have all the data,
and we don't have all the data.''
</P>
<P>
   Redmond said he planned to study the impeachment process
intently before Thursday's vote. That process, he said, is little
understood, even by America's most educated citizens. Noting the
high concentration here of scientists involved in nuclear weapons
research, the congressman said, ``You have more Ph.D.s per capita
in Los Alamos than anywhere else in the nation, but I don't think
that one out of 100 understand impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a few hours before the first committee votes, Redmond
helped open a new homeless center in Santa Fe, a liberal city that
voted against him last month by a 3-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each person who spoke with me told me personally, to my face,
said that I should vote for impeachment,'' he recalled Saturday.
``I've got Democrats coming up to me, with red faces, saying `What
am I going to tell my kids?'''
</P>
<P>
   Redmond, who has a master's degree in philosophy of science, has
consistently voted with the Republican majority during his one term
in Congress. A former minister at the Santa Fe Christian Church,
Redmond was dismissive of the president's most recent plea for
forgiveness, made Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is no clear direct object, how could there be
forgiveness?'' he asked, recalling the practice in his church of
asking forgiveness for specific transgressions. ``He wants
forgiveness, but for what?''
</P>
<P>
   As Christmas carols played in the doughnut shop's jukebox and
aluminum-foil snowflakes twinkled from the ceiling, the congressman
cited an Old Testament parable to say that ``forgiveness does not
mean not having to live the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Switching to the modern language of therapy, from his days as a
marriage and drug counselor, he said, ``The president is calling on
the nation to share his victimization.''
</P>
<P>
   In conclusion, he said the president would be better off with
``tough love.''
</P>
<P>
   At the shop counter, opinions were divided.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Duncan, a bed-and-breakfast owner from Taos, a Democratic
bastion, was ordering a cup of hot cocoa, with whipped cream on
top.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm embarrassed, disgusted, outraged _ but I'm not saying I
want everything disrupted,'' Ms. Duncan said, referring to the
president's affair with Monica Lewinsky. Referring to the recent
impeachment flare-up, she said: ``It's running away with us. The
people don't have a say.''
</P>
<P>
   But Veta Floyd, the owner of the shop, Daylight Doughnuts,
voiced an opinion more in line with Los Alamos, a conservative
community that voted heavily for Redmond last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice needs to be done,'' she said, preparing an espresso
almost exactly at the time the Judiciary Committee in Washington
was voting the fourth article of impeachment. ``It doesn't matter
what the public thinks. We have rules to follow. We have a
Constitution.''

 &HT;    CLINTON, SEEKING TO RALLY ISRAELIS BEHIND PEACE INITIATIVE,
URGES ACCEPTANCE OF PALESTINIANS
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM President Clinton used a Hanukkah message Sunday to
try to rally the Israeli people around a badly listing
U.S.-brokered peace plan, urging them to accept the Palestinians as
their legitimate neighbors with the right to embrace their dignity
and pursue their dreams.
</P>
<P>
   He assured Israelis that the Palestinians were poised to
renounce, ''finally and forever,'' their calls for the destruction
of Israel at a meeting Clinton is to attend in
Palestinian-controlled Gaza on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I will witness the reaffirmation of their commitment to
foreswear fully, finally and forever all the provisions in their
charter that called for the destruction of Israel,'' Clinton told
reporters during a joint press conference with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   ''To see this happen,'' said Netanyahu, ''would be a welcome and
positive development.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu stopped short, however, of saying whether the gesture
would persuade him to renew Israeli troop withdrawals from occupied
West Bank territories.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Netanyahu called on Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to
retract earlier pledges to declare a Palestinian state by May 4,
unless a comprehensive Israeli-Palestinian peace accord is
completed before then.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one can seriously expect Israel to hand over another inch
of territory,'' Netanyahu said, ''unless and until such an
unambiguous correction is made.''
</P>
<P>
   As Netanyahu talked tough, Clinton went directly to the Israeli
people, with a nationally televised speech, to ask them to maintain
faith in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of his appeal lay Clinton's assertion that the
peace process can't move forward in an atmosphere of continuing
suspicion and antagonism from both sides in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ''We must approach the task ahead without illusions, but not
without hope, for hope is not an illusion,'' Clinton said in a
speech on the first night of the eight-day Jewish observation of
Hannukah. ''The idea of peace and security in the Promised Land
must keep hope alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and Netanyahu are in precarious leadership
positions that may limit their ability to solve one of the world's
most intractable problems. Clinton faces House impeachment votes
later this week. Netanyahu, who narrowly survived a no-confidence
vote in the Israeli parliament last week, may soon face another.
</P>
<P>
   Behind Sunday's lofty rhetoric were difficult talks between
Netanyahu and Clinton. During his three-day mission, Clinton is
trying to salvage the peace process in the face of escalating
street violence, an almost daily exchange of recriminations between
Palestinians and Israelis and a failure of both sides to keep
promises they made at the White House just six weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   After 18 months of stalemate in a peace process that began in
earnest five years ago, Clinton brought Netanyahu and Arafat
together in October at the Wye River Plantation retreat in rural
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
   Nine torturous days later, the men emerged for a White House
signing of a set of agreements aimed at moving forward toward
so-called ``final status issues'' _ those contentious matters, such
as the future control of Jerusalem and the question of Palestinian
statehood, that must be resolved before the parties can construct a
comprehensive Mideast peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   First, though, the Wye accords have to be implemented.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu, for instance, promised to withdraw Israeli troops
from an additional 13 percent of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, a
move that would put roughly 40 percent of the territory under the
full or partial control of the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Israel completed the first phase of that withdrawal last month.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu suspended further withdrawals, however, in the face of
growing anti-Israeli unrest by Palestinians, who have hurled rocks
at Israeli troops in recent weeks, protesting what they see as
Israel's failure to release Palestinian prisoners as promised at
Wye.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu counters that Israel has released a number of
Palestinian prisoners mostly charged with petty crimes or larceny
but that it will not, and never agreed to, release accused
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was among several discussed Sunday during about four
hours of talks between Clinton and Netanyahu, and it will be on the
agenda Monday when the president meets with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to return Monday night to Jerusalem, where he is
to meet again with Netanyahu on Tuesday to try to nail down some
gains from this visit, his fourth to Israel since he took office
six years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can make this peace, believe me, you can do this,''
Clinton said in a televised speech delivered before several
thousand Israeli high school students, college students and
soldiers.

WITH RIVAL DISTRIBUTORS WEAKENED, XEROX HAS TEMPORARY ADVANTAGE

<TEXT>
<P>
   The copier wars are full upon us.
</P>
<P>
   Canon USA, declaring ``X no longer marks the spot,'' is trying
to convince corporate customers that its digital copiers can do
anything Xerox's can do, and more. Hewlett-Packard Co., which has
generally stuck to printers, is pushing hybrid printer-copiers
called Mopiers. Xerox, meanwhile, keeps spewing forth new versions
of its own digital copiers.
</P>
<P>
   But despite hugely expensive advertising campaigns that promote
each product's features, the war will not be won on the product
battlefield alone. Instead, whoever locks in the best distribution
network may well push up to the head of the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've said our sales will grow from $7.1 billion now to $10
billion in 2001, and that's not going to happen without strong
distribution,'' said Tim Andree, a Canon spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   The question mark is the fate of Ikon Office Solutions and of
Danka Americas, a unit of Danka Business Systems of Britain.
Although together they distribute only about 9 percent of the
copiers sold in the United States, they are the primary outlets for
Canon and other Japanese copier companies.
</P>
<P>
   But Danka and Ikon are having severe growing pains. Both have
been on acquisition binges and each is having a tough time turning
its hodgepodge of dealerships into a cohesive whole. Both swept
their chief executives out of office in 1998 and brought in new
management teams.
</P>
<P>
   Danka Americas, based in St. Petersburg, Fla., had domestic
sales last year of $2.1 billion. It is still choking on the huge
copier business that it bought from the Eastman Kodak Co. in 1996.
As a result, the company is in severe financial straits, and most
analysts expect it will soon sell off huge chunks of assets.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Ikon, which is based in Valley Forge, Pa., and has
revenues of $5 billion, is profitable. But Ikon has been distracted
as it weeds out secondary suppliers like Sharp, and concentrates on
being the main distributor for Canon, Ricoh and Oce.
</P>
<P>
   ``H-P saw Danka and Ikon as potential allies, and their
implosion has definitely retarded H-P's advance into this market,''
said Charles LeCompte, president of Lyra Research, a market
research firm in Newtonville, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can Canon, which sells extensively through Ikon, be happy
right now, said John Kelly, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.
``It's never great when your main distributor is trying to increase
profitability rather than sales,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, copier companies are scrambling to find new
outlets. Canon, which has become a fierce competitor to Xerox in
the U.S. copier market, is beefing up its sales subsidiaries in New
York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles and Chicago, and is concentrating
more on direct sales to government offices.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are not getting the kind of orders you expect from
Ikon and Danka, you have to focus elsewhere,'' Andree said.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett, meanwhile, is scouring the country for independent
dealers. ``Our strategy was always to go after worldwide accounts,
and Ikon and Danka seemed to fit in with that,'' said Tim Haney,
general manager of Hewlett's Mopier division. ``But neither of them
can meet our needs now.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which is good news for the Xerox Corp., which controls
most of its own distribution, and whose well-known brand is the one
to beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Xerox has a 12-month window in which to gobble up even more
market share,'' said Jonathan Rosenzweig, an analyst with Salomon
Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   The company is exploiting that opportunity to the hilt, said
Lynn Ritter, a copier industry analyst at Dataquest, a market
research firm. ``You can bet Xerox is asking Danka and Ikon
accounts, `Hey, are you sure you want to buy from these people when
you don't even know if they'll be in business tomorrow?''' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the sales representatives of Xerox, newly trained on how
to sell products that can be connected to computer networks, are
doing just that. They are holding firm on prices that are, in
general, the market's highest. But they are offering rich trade-ins
for non-Xerox equipment, they are promoting the interactivity of an
all-Xerox line of printers and copiers, and they are not so subtly
pointing out Xerox's financial stability.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that we have a big `Kill Ikon and Danka' program
going,'' said David Myerscough, Xerox's senior vice president for
corporate business strategy. ``But we figure we have 12 to 18
months before they are back to full strength and sure, we'll be
more aggressive until then.''
</P>
<P>
   In good part because of the troubles in its American unit, Danka
lost $13.4 million last quarter alone. Under a 1996 deal, Kodak
continues to manufacture copiers, but Danka must pay for much of
Kodak's research and development. And Danka must buy Kodak's output
whether the copiers sell well or not. Danka has paid Kodak for tens
of millions of dollars' worth of copiers that are gathering dust in
its warehouses, and is in arrears for millions of dollars more.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tremendous cash squeeze for us,'' said Brian Merriman,
who left Toshiba to become president of Danka Americas in August.
</P>
<P>
   Danka has hired the investment banking firm of Wasserstein
Perella to solicit offers for its European operations and for its
facilities management and fax units. It has submitted a new
business plan to suppliers and creditors, and they seem to approve.
Kodak and other vendors have given Danka breathing room on its
bills. And Danka's banks, which were threatening to call in loans,
have extended $75 million more in credit.
</P>
<P>
   Merriman said that Danka America's revenues were up 6 percent in
the last quarter, ``because our folks are finally refocused on
selling.'' He said Danka was poised to introduce some ``very
exciting'' new Kodak copiers and would continue to blanket the
country with Canon color copiers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People forget that despite all the troubles, we've got more
than 200 locations in 48 states that are selling and servicing
customers every day,'' Merriman said.
</P>
<P>
   Ikon's executives display a similar combination of regret and
optimism. ``We bought a lot of second-tier dealerships that didn't
have much synergy,'' said Dennis LeStrange, Ikon's senior vice
president for marketing. ``But we're in 95 percent of the country,
and we're stressing consistency and integration.''
</P>
<P>
   Ikon has dropped all but a few high-volume suppliers and is
juggling territories so that salespeople in charge of large
corporate accounts are not distracted by smaller ones. And,
LeStrange emphasizes, Ikon's 10,000-strong service staff has not
been affected by the turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, Xerox is gaining momentum,'' he said. ``But we offer more
flexible terms; we offer financing; we offer a broad range of
technology, and absolutely no one offers service like we do.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Xerox might disagree with that; Hewlett-Packard cannot. Of the
top-tier copier makers, it may be fighting the worst headwinds.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it buys most of its printer engines from Canon.
But now both companies are chasing the copier market, and Canon is
unlikely to give a competitor exclusive rights to its latest
models.
</P>
<P>
   And service is a big obstacle for H-P. When printers break,
customers usually take them back to the store. Corporate copier
customers are used to on-site installation and repair service.
Since most of the latest copiers are plugged into computer
networks, such on-site service is essential.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox, whose roots are in the copier world, already has an
extensive field service organization; Hewlett, coming from the
printer side of the business, is only now developing one.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett has been busily signing on copier dealers large enough
to serve corporate accounts. ``There are lots of qualified
resellers who can offer a full gamut of services,'' Haney said.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett's competitors call that wishful thinking. They say that
the best dealers have been snapped up by Danka, Ikon and Canon, and
that companies like Sharp, which Ikon has dropped, will have first
shot at the remaining ones.
</P>
<P>
   Hewlett is distributing some Mopiers through Danka, which has an
extensive service group. But neither side seems happy. ``They
expected us to move more product, and we expected people to like
the product better,'' Merriman said.
</P>
<P>
   The distribution battlefield may shift again before any clear
winner emerges. The new arena may well be the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computer-savvy buyers will go to a company's home page and
configure exactly the product they want,'' Myerscough of Xerox
said. ``They won't want a skewed pitch from anyone's salesman.''

GERMANS SEEK PLAN TO AVOID SUITS OVER NAZI-ERA LABOR
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS with BARRY MEIER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Spurred by Germany's new Social Democratic
government and a huge trans-Atlantic merger, Germany's banks and
industrial conglomerates are urgently trying to devise a broad plan
to compensate Holocaust survivors and Poles, Russians and other
Europeans enslaved by the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   The corporations, from Deutsche Bank to Siemens and
Daimler-Chrysler, are eager to free themselves from a flood of
American class-action suits alleging that they profited by
collaborating with the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has echoes of the battle between Jewish groups and
Swiss banks over the assets of Jews who died in the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   But it is broader and more complex: German manufacturers face a
battery of lawsuits filed on behalf of hundreds of thousands of
workers who were forced by the Nazis to work as virtual slaves in
German factories. Many victims were from eastern or central Europe
and most were not Jewish, generating battles over who can best
represent them.
</P>
<P>
   Under instructions from Germany's new chancellor, Gerhard
Schroeder, the government has held three meetings with
industrialists since the end of October. Although the primary goal
is to settle the laborers' claims, government officials also want
to address myriad claims against German banks over looted bank
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Israel Singer, secretary general of the World Jewish Congress,
met on Thursday with Schroeder's chief of staff and then with
Rolf-Ernst Breuer, the chairman of Deutsche Bank. The congress, a
leader in this summer's $1.25 billion settlement of Jewish claims
against Swiss banks, has also expressed interest in the forced
laborers, but its eventual role is unclear because it does not
represent non-Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Executives and government officials say they hope to produce a
compensation plan within two months. Deutsche Bank, which is
seeking American approval for its $10.1 billion purchase of Bankers
Trust, is holding its own talks. Alan Hevesi, New York City's
controller, vowed he would seek to block the huge takeover if the
German bank does not resolve wartime claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``One should expect a solution,'' predicted Ignatz Bubis,
chairman of the Central Jewish Council in Germany, who accompanied
Singer. ``But it is still an open question as to whether you can
deal with all these areas at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   On both sides, unity is lacking. Rival teams of American lawyers
and Jewish advocacy groups are mired in maneuvering. German
bankers, insurers and manufacturers have no common strategy.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting two weeks ago, Daimler-Chrysler executives said
they did not want to be lumped into a settlement with German banks.
According to people involved in the discussions, Daimler fears the
charges against the banks are potentially far more financially
damaging than those against the company.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder has put his chief of staff, Bodo Hombach, in charge of
hammering out a plan.
</P>
<P>
   Both corporate and government leaders favor a new fund to
compensate Holocaust victims. Schroeder has said the government
wants companies to put up all the money, but government officials
have suggested tax breaks that could in some cases effectively
halve the cost.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder's role marks a big reversal from that of his
predecessor, Helmut Kohl, who argued that Germany had already paid
tens of billions of dollars since the end of World War II to Jewish
groups, the government of Israel and Holocaust victims in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Therkel Straede, a Fulbright scholar at Georgetown University
and co-author of a book on the wartime activities of Volkswagen,
says Jews made up about half of the 750,000 concentration camp
inmates _ the ``slave laborers'' _ employed by German companies in
1944. Many workers died.
</P>
<P>
   But German industry also used 7 million non-Jewish foreign
workers, more than half of whom were brought to Germany against
their will and held in inhuman conditions, Straede said.
</P>
<P>
   John Kornblum, the American ambassador to Germany, has met with
German officials, but the Clinton administration has taken a
cautious approach.
</P>
<P>
   This month State Department officials came to Bonn to brief
Germans on American class-action law, a concept alien to Europeans.
Hoping to gain leverage, some American lawyers are trying to draw
both the State Department and the German government into more
active roles.
</P>
<P>
   In October, for example, Michael Hausfeld and Martin Mendelsohn,
two Washington lawyers active in Holocaust-related lawsuits, went
to Poland to discuss forced-labor claims with government officials
and others. Hausfeld said he hopes for an international conference
that would include business executives and government officials
from Germany, the United States and the workers' countries of
origin.
</P>
<P>
   But the prospects for the Germans' plan, which is supported by
the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, are dim. Although
Polish officials have voiced support, American diplomats remain
uncommitted. The German government has not expressed support.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of World War II, Germany has made only limited
reparation payments on the forced-labor issue; some companies have
made small payments to a group affiliated with the World Jewish
Congress. Forced laborers in former Communist countries have
received virtually nothing, Straede said.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, the campaign to compensate workers was largely
the preserve of a University of Bremen lecturer, Klaus von
Muenchhausen, who began raising the clamor about the obligations of
Volkswagen, Siemens and scores of other companies.
</P>
<P>
   Using several German court decisions that appeared to expose
companies to lawsuits in Germany, and backed by an anonymous
philanthropist, von Muenchhausen threatened to sue many
manufacturers on behalf of 100 former laborers living in Israel. As
a result, Volkswagen abruptly reversed its long-standing refusal to
compensate victims and announced its own fund several months ago.
</P>
<P>
   von Muenchhausen, who stands to gain little from his efforts,
criticizes both American lawyers and companies like Volkswagen,
which he said tried last month to placate him by offering a free
car and airplane tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Volkswagen's chief spokesman, Klaus Kocks, said in a letter to
von Muenchhausen that the company merely wanted to alleviate his
costs in pursuing the talks, but in an interview, von Muenchhausen
dismissed the offer as ``disgusting.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a recent Friday, Tyshon Young, 13, and a
nutritionist strolled the aisles at Fairway in Harlem for a little
comparison shopping.
</P>
<P>
   He picked up a box of butter cookies. She pointed to graham
crackers. He picked out frosted flakes. She said Special K was a
better choice. He picked ice cream. She told him to get the low-fat
brand. He wanted a mango. She said he could only have half of one,
once or twice a week.
</P>
<P>
   By the time they made their way to the dairy section, Tyshon
turned defensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love cheese,'' he said, pointing to a package of sliced
American. ``I usually eat a whole pack of crackers, about four or
five slices of cheese, and a drink, like fruit punch.''
</P>
<P>
   High-fat, high-carbohydrate snacks like that have made Tyshon
obese, which has triggered a form of diabetes once considered rare
among people his age. The trip to the grocery store was part of an
elaborate effort to coax him into a new regimen of exercise and
healthy eating that could save his life.
</P>
<P>
   At 5 feet 6 inches and 216 pounds, Tyshon represents an alarming
new health trend: the sharp increase in the number of youngsters
with Type 2 diabetes, also known as adult-onset diabetes, an
incurable and progressively damaging disease that can cause kidney
failure, blindness and poor circulation, which, in turn, can lead
to amputation. Doctors long believed the disease occurred only
during middle age or later.
</P>
<P>
   Although there have not been any national surveys documenting
the rise of this form of diabetes in children, several small-scale
studies have found that such cases have more than tripled in the
last five years, and, anecdotally, doctors across the country say
they have observed similar trends among their own patients. In the
last month, officials at the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention convened a meeting to discuss the problem, and the
American Diabetes Association has appointed a new task force.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten years ago, we were teaching medical students that you
didn't see this disease in people under 40, and now we're seeing it
in people under 10,'' said Dr. Robin Goland, co-director of the
Naomi Berrie Diabetes Center, which opened in October at Columbia
University's College of Physicians and Surgeons in Manhattan. Dr.
Goland said Type 2 diabetes was diagnosed in 10 percent to 20
percent of the center's new pediatric patients, compared with less
than 4 percent in the hospital's clinics five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the numbers we're starting to see,'' Goland said, ``this
could be the beginning of an epidemic.''
</P>
<P>
   Children with Type 2 diabetes look a lot like their adult
counterparts. Most are African-American and Hispanic, with a
particularly high rate found among children of Mexican descent.
Most of the Type 2 children have close relatives with the disease,
and almost all are obese.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, doctors said, the spiraling rate of childhood obesity
in America _ declared an epidemic last month by the U.S. Surgeon
General, David Satcher _ is the most significant factor in the
rising numbers of children with this form of diabetes. A common
definition of obesity is when a child's weight exceeds 20 percent
of ideal weight, based on age, height and frame.
</P>
<P>
   According to the most recent statistics from the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Surveys, the number of obese children has
doubled in the last two decades. One in five children in America is
overweight, researchers found. Poor, minority children, who often
eat a lot of junk food and have few neighborhood recreation
programs, are at greatest risk, doctors said.
</P>
<P>
   Obesity, by itself, does not always lead to diabetes, doctors
say, but it is a major risk factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to make someone a diabetic, then make them
obese,'' said Dr. Rudolph Leibel, head of molecular genetics at
Columbia University and a co-director of the diabetes center.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers speculate that the rise in reported cases of Type 2
diabetes in children results from both an increased incidence of
the disease and an increased awareness of it by primary-care
physicians. Until the last few years, Goland said, the correct
diagnosis was likely to have been missed in some children.
</P>
<P>
   Diabetes, which affects about 16 million Americans and is the
sixth-leading cause of death by disease in the United States,
results from a breakdown in the body's system for absorbing sugar.
Most children with the disease have a form called Type 1, or
juvenile diabetes, which develops when the pancreas, for no known
reason, stops producing insulin, the hormone that controls glucose
use. These children must take daily insulin injections for the rest
of their lives or face almost immediate death, while also limiting
their sugar intake.
</P>
<P>
   In Type 2, or adult-onset diabetes, the pancreas produces
insulin, but the organs grow increasingly resistant to it. Many
people erroneously believe it to be a more benign form of the
disease because it can occur in the body for years without
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   If the disease is left undiagnosed or untreated, however,
life-threatening complications, caused by damage to blood vessels,
can develop within 10 years to 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we aren't detecting this disease in children because we
aren't looking for it,'' Goland said, ``then we are going to start
seeing complications in people in their 20s that we would normally
associate with people in their 60s and 70s.''
</P>
<P>
   At 38, Valeria Wilson of the Bronx has already had two heart
attacks _ complications from Type 2 diabetes. The diabetes has also
caused such poor vision that she stopped working two years ago and
hired a nurse to measure her insulin doses.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wilson, 5 feet, 6 inches and 251 pounds, was told she had
Type 2 during a routine pregnancy exam when she was 21, but doctors
suspect she probably had the disease for years. The delayed
diagnosis, doctors said, likely contributed to her health problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got old too fast,'' said Ms. Wilson, the mother of two
daughters. ``My mother is 73, and she's not as sick as me.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Like adults with Type 2, many children with the disease can
control their blood glucose levels with weight loss and diet
modification. Eventually, however, most people require oral
medication and insulin.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are children who likely would have developed the disease
at some later time in their lives, but their obesity has brought it
out early,'' said Dr. Sandra Puczynski, chairwoman of the research
advisory board for the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation. ``Losing
weight will not cure them, but it would help significantly.''
</P>
<P>
   Losing weight is a daunting goal for many children with Type 2
diabetes. Often they have parents who work long hours and cannot be
home to prepare balanced meals, and they live in neighborhoods
where fast food restaurants and convenience stores outnumber
supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   Within a block of 12-year-old Nuribel Reyes' home in Queens,
there is a McDonald's and a Burger King.
</P>
<P>
   ``She used to eat at McDonald's every night,'' said her mother,
Amancia Reyes, who runs two small beauty salons.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she was 10, Nuribel, at 4 feet, 6 inches, weighed
more than 145 pounds. Mrs. Reyes said that when her daughter first
began gaining weight, the doctors told her the girl would outgrow
the ``baby-fat'' after she passed puberty.
</P>
<P>
   That summer, Nuribel developed a severe yeast infection and
began losing bladder control _ common symptoms of adult-onset
diabetes _ and the disease was diagnosed by a different doctor. By
adhering to a strict meal plan, Nuribel maintained the same weight
as she grew taller, and her blood glucose levels fell to normal
range.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, Nuribel started at a new school. Her mother said
her determination to lose weight has deteriorated, and with it, her
health.
</P>
<P>
   Embarrassed, Nuribel has not told classmates or teachers about
her disease. She refuses to take a lunch to school, and sometimes,
Nuribel said, when her friends buy candy bars, so does she.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sugar in her blood is getting high again,'' Mrs. Reyes
said, crying. ``I worry all the time that one day she is going to
be at school and eat something that will damage one of her
organs.''
</P>
<P>
   Several small studies in cities across the country _ including
Cincinnati and San Antonio _ provided the first data about the rise
in cases like Nuribel's.
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 study, conducted at a Cincinnati diabetes center by the
University of Cincinnati College of Medicine, showed that among
their pediatric patients, 16 percent had Type 2 in 1994, compared
to 2 percent to 4 percent prior to 1992. The researchers also found
that Type 2 diabetes was diagnosed in more than one-third of new
diabetes patients between the ages of 10 and 19.
</P>
<P>
   And Dr. Kenneth Jones, a pediatric endocrinologist at the
University of California at San Diego, said clinics in his area
report that the number of children with Type 2 diabetes has
increased tenfold in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to maybe see one case a year,'' he said. ``Now we see
one case a month, and some clinics are reporting two and three
cases a month. It's pretty scary.''
</P>
<P>
   Identifying children who are at risk is relatively easy. In
addition to obesity and a family history of the disease,
researchers said, many develop a condition called acanthosis
nigricans, dark, irregular folds of skin around the neck, under the
arms or behind the knees. Symptoms of the disease include frequent
urination and chronic thirst.
</P>
<P>
   Nigel Estick, a 17-year-old senior at La Guardia High School of
Music and Art and the Performing Arts in Manhattan, suffered these
symptoms for years before the disease was diagnosed. He had pains
in his legs, a frequently dry mouth and deteriorating vision. But,
his mother said, doctors told her there was nothing seriously wrong
with him. They suggested that he was emotionally depressed, put him
on Prozac, and urged her to insist that he stay in school.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tested him for leukemia, they tested him for sickle
cell,'' his mother, Patricia Estick, grumbled, ``but no one tested
him for diabetes.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, Nigel, who is 5 feet, 8 inches tall and 250 pounds, began
vomiting two or three times a day. One morning, he could hardly
stand and his vision was completely blurred. Emergency room doctors
discovered that Nigel's blood glucose level had soared to 8 times
higher than normal. He spent nearly a week in intensive care.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Nigel is 40 pounds lighter. He takes two insulin shots a
day and tries to stay away from the Snickers bars he adores.
Pleased with his progress, doctors said they hope to get the
teen-ager off insulin soon.
</P>
<P>
   At times, Nigel said, he cannot enjoy his improvement because of
worries about what lies ahead. ``This disease is probably going to
really mess me up,'' he said. ``Eventually everyone succumbs to the
disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Adults with Type 2 diabetes often control the disease with oral
medications and sometimes the same pills are used in children,
however none of the drugs have been formally approved for pediatric
patients. In the next month, several clinics across the country
will begin testing the drug metformin in children with Type 2.
</P>
<P>
   In Manhattan, trials will be conducted at Mount Sinai Medical
Center and at the Berrie Diabetes Center of Columbia's medical
school.
</P>
<P>
   Opened in October, the Berrie center is different from many
other diabetes treatment centers in that doctors and nutritionists
actively encourage a diabetic's family and friends to become
educated about the disease and to help the patients stay healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Nutritionists travel to schools to speak to patients' teachers
and classmates, teammates and cafeteria staff. They make house
calls to examine foods in their patients' homes and to lead family
discussions about the importance of exercise and healthy eating.
And they conduct regular supermarket tours, like the recent Friday
afternoon trip with Tyshon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can get family and friends involved with the treatment,
we will be much more successful in getting kids to be compliant,''
Goland said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his nutritional and family counseling, doctors at
the Naomi Berrie center have begun treating Tyshon with metformin.
At his last checkup, he had lost 25 pounds. Tyshon, his mother and
his nutritionist, Kira Almeida, were thrilled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is off limits to you,'' she said, urging Tyshon to
stick with his new eating habits. ``But you have to eat in
moderation. Small changes can make a big difference.''

   CANTON, Ohio _ On Sunday morning at 7, the sky was still pitch
black and Sam Sliman could see his breath as he unlocked the front
door to the News Depot. He went to fetch the dolly to wheel in the
Sunday newspapers, 310 of them, The Repository of Canton, The Akron
Beacon-Journal, The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and The New York Times,
every one with the same basic lead headline screaming: House Votes
Next on Impeachment!
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what's funny,'' said Sliman, a registered Republican
who thinks that the House should impeach the president but that he
should not be removed from office. ``I went to two Christmas
parties last night and no one was talking about impeachment. They
talked about whether the Indians should go after Roger Clemens,
they talked about Kevin Brown's $100 million contract with the
Dodgers.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that they don't know or don't have opinions. In fact,
in conversations with several dozen customers who had come downtown
to pick up their Sunday papers it is striking how much people do
know about impeachment's fine points.
</P>
<P>
   As Stephen Goldberger, a businessman and registered Republican
opposed to impeachment says, ``If you read 5 per cent of what's
written, you know 100 per cent of what you need.'' It's more that
the whole process has taken on a life of its own and seems surreal,
far away, out of their hands, scripted and beyond their control.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got a certain momentum all its own,'' says John Gray, a
plant manager and Democrat opposed to impeachment. ``I feel like
we're all standing here watching this snowball roll downhill.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Ralph Regula, the local Republican congressman, a moderate
who still has not announced his position on impeachment, has been
surprised by how few calls he has personally received. When Tom
Hannon, a state Republican leader and strong advocate for
impeachment, came in to pick up his papers after 8 a.m. mass at St.
John's, he was asked whether he had phoned Regula. ``You know I
haven't,'' he said, ``and I should.''
</P>
<P>
   Canton and surrounding Stark County is a political bellwether, a
Northeast Ohio community that has consistently in the last several
elections voted as the nation did for president, supporting the
Republicans in the 1980s and swinging to President Clinton in the
1990s. For this reason, The Times did a series of stories here in
1996, when Stark voted for Clinton by an 8 per cent margin _
precisely his national margin of victory.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton still seems to have considerable support here, at
least among people picking up their Sunday papers at the News
Depot, that support does not appear as strong as it was during a
visit here in late September. Although it is still easier to find
Republicans opposing impeachment than Democrats supporting it, on
this visit, opinions seemed more closely divided along partisan
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Says Sliman, who knows the political leanings of almost all his
customers, ``As soon as they walk in, I can tell you what they'll
say about impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good morning, Red,'' said Sliman. ``How you doing, big guy?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not bad for a poor boy,'' said Jack ``Red'' Mayle, a retired
union steelworker. Asked his view on impeachment, Mayle said,
``It's wrong. I'm an African-American and I recognize a lynch mob
when I see it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand Peter Voss, a retired chief executive officer
of an engineering company who votes Republican, favored removing
Clinton, saying it was strong medicine, but in the long run the
country would be healthier for it. ``This would be a definite
signal to other officeholders that character does matter,'' he
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Roy Gutierrez, the former chairman of the Stark Democratic party
who picked up a copy of the Plain-Dealer and fellow Democrat Bob
Horowitz, the county prosecutor, getting his copy of the
Beacon-Journal, supported the president, while Donna Shaheen, a
retired office worker from Black McCuskey, one of the big corporate
law firms in town, favored impeachment. ``He lied,'' said Ms.
Shaheen, a Republican voter. ``If I had done what he did, I'd be in
jail right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard DeVaux, a private investigator, was one of the few
Democrats interviewed who wanted the president out. ``He should be
hung,'' said DeVaux. ``The idea that this is some woman thing is
bull_ he lied under oath.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jim Lockshin, a Republican-leaning businessman who has been
coming into the News Depot for ``40 or 50 years,'' opposed
impeachment, as did Les Walker, another Republican voter stopping
by for his paper after the 8:30 service at Christ Presbyterian
Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did lie,'' said Walker, ``but they were asking him very
private questions that most people would not admit to. If I was in
that position, I think I'd be evasive, too. It doesn't seem of any
danger to the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Schneider, a retired university instructor who votes
Republican thinks he should be impeached, and face trial in the
Senate, but is not sure there is enough evidence yet to merit
removal. Still, she's hopeful they'll get him. ``I keep hoping
they'll get some information out of Susan McDougal and Web
Hubbell,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   M.L. Schultze, the managing editor of The Repository, and her
husband Rick Senften, the city editor, made their usual stop for
three Sunday papers, after attending services at St. Paul's
Episcopal Church. ``They had a special healing service this
morning,'' said Ms. Schultze. ``There was a laying on of hands.
Some asked for their arthritis to be healed, others asked for
healing of the anger and fear that is going on in the nation now.''
</P>
<P>
   While The Repository _ which endorsed Clinton twice _ was one of
the first papers in the nation to call for his resignation, in
recent weeks, says Ms. Schultze, its editorial stance has been less
sure and Sunday's editorial was more neutral, acknowledging that
the president had ``managed to maintain a leadership position much
to the regret of his opponents and our surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   The Plain-Dealer took a less generous view in an editorial
headlined ``Impeach Him.'' ``Failure to impeach would even permit
him to claim exoneration despite his obvious mendacity,'' said the
paper, adding, ``Clinton trampled on the responsibilities of the
presidency with self-centered disregard.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Sliman felt that whatever the president's fate,
the country would remain strong. Sliman left at 10 to go to mass at
St. Peter's, saying he'd be back at 1 to close, and he was, right
on the dot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should I shut off the electricity?'' David Minor, a clerk,
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do it Dave; you can go,'' said Sliman. He removed the
receipt tape from the register and turned off the power to the
front display windows, stopping Santa's and Rudolph's heads from
bobbing.
</P>
<P>
   There was still a big stack of Sunday papers left. ``People will
pick them up on Monday when they come downtown to work,'' Sliman
explained. One of the reasons for choosing to live in a place like
Canton is that it isn't the worst thing in the world if you read
Sunday's news a day or two late.
</P>
<P>
   Sliman was looking forward to Sunday dinner. His wife was
cooking pork chops and mashed potatoes and at 4 p.m. they were
going to his son T.J.'s basketball game. ``Things that really
matter,'' said Sliman, turning off the lights.

 &HT;    Ga. Tech scores overtime victory against Bulldogs
 &HT;    WITH PHOTOS of Jason Collier
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With emotions running the gamut from despair to
exhiliration, with Bobby Cremins cradling his head deep in his
hands in the early going and leading the crowd in cheers at game's
end, Georgia Tech staged one of the greatest comebacks in the
175-game history of its series with Georgia and grabbed an 84-79
overtime victory.
</P>
<P>
   Reminiscent of the 62-61 game Tech won in Alexander Memorial two
seasons ago by coming from 11 points down in the final four minutes
to grab the win from the Bulldogs' jowls, Tech found itself on the
wrong end of a 65-50 score with 8:06 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   But Jason Floyd, who had a horrendous day shooting, hit on a
drive and after a free throw by Georgia's G.G. Smith, freshman
guard Tony Akins hit a 3-pointer and got another basket on a drive
and T.J. Vines hit a 3-pointer and the Bulldogs' advantage was
66-60.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the Bulldogs edged their lead to 72-65, but Floyd
made a 3-pointer, Indiana transfer Jason Collier, playing in his
first game, hit another 3-pointer and followed that with a layup.
Akins calmly sank two free throws to throw the game into overtime.
</P>
<P>
   In the extra period, Tech broke on top on a layup by Collier and
another Akins' drive and the Jackets did not trail again.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been coaching here 18 years and that's one of the most
unbelievable games I've ever coached,'' said Cremins, who was
waving his arms widly in the game's final seconds, begging the
crowd of 8,128 for support. ''I thought it was over. I was hoping
we weren't going to get embarrassed. I didn't want to lose it by 15
or 20 or 25. The kids just dug down deep. It was absolutely no
coaching.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a great game to win and a tough game to lose and it
looked as if Cremins and Georgia coach Ron Jirsa were verbally
sparring at the end, but Cremins laughed it off, saying, ''I like
Ron. Ron does a great job.''
</P>
<P>
   The 7-0 Collier was magnificent in his coming-out party, scoring
22 and grabbing 11 rebounds in 42 minutes. But as good as Collier
was, Akins was the man of the hour with 24 points and seven
assists. The ball and the game were in his hands, both in
regulation and overtime and the 18-year-old didn't disappoint. ''I
love having the ball late,'' he said. ''I dont' know if I'm
supposed to or not, but I love it. I wasn't nervous. I was more
nervous at the start. I'm very comfortable at the free-throw
line.''
</P>
<P>
   Collier looked equally at ease, although he admitted he wasn't
in game shape after a year's layoff mandated by the NCAA for a
transfer. He looked exhausted midway through the second half and
came up short on four shots in a row. But he recovered, scoring
nine of his 22 in the final four minutes of regulation and
overtime. ''I'd had the flu for the last week and lost some weight
and then lost some more studying for exams and I was exhausted,''
he said. Collier, whose father played at Tech from 1973-76, says he
didn't envision a first game like this. ''I didn't know I'd do this
well. But ever since high school, I always played well in front of
Coach Cremins. I've heard all about the Tech-Georgia rivalry all my
life. I understand what it means, especially to my dad.''

<P>
   THOUSAND OAKS, Calif. -- In the summer of 1996, Anthony
Kourounis made this pitch to his orthodontist as his son was
getting his braces done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Norm, I'm kind of looking at forming a new bank,'' said the
former banking executive.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't an offbeat idea. His orthodontist had been involved in
starting two other banks. Today, the orthodontist is a shareholder
who sits on the board of 10-month-old California Oaks State Bank,
along with Kourounis, the former mayor of suburban Thousand Oaks in
Southern California and seven other folks with longstanding roots
in the area.
</P>
<P>
   That's just fine with Kourounis, who believes that local folks
can do a better job of serving local needs than big banks
headquartered elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of the major banks specifically address the needs of a
specific community,'' said Kourounis, president of California Oaks.
``You sacrifice the client base in the interest of efficiency.''
</P>
<P>
   His belief that small financial institutions can better serve
locals is shared by other entrepreneurs in California and
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   From 1993 to 1997, the number of new banks and thrifts increased
from 68 to 200, according to the American Bankers Association in
Washington. There were 84 in the first half of 1998. In California,
12 new institutions were formed this year, up from seven in 1997.
There are 25 state applications pending.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the backdrop for this spate of new entrants is a
consolidating industry: The total number of banks and thrifts has
dropped from 13,220 in 1993 to 10,712 today nationally, largely
thanks to mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for this divergent trend: As banks and thrifts merge,
they may leave certain areas underserved or anger pockets of
customers who don't like differences in services, products and
personnel. Smelling an opportunity, small banks and thrifts are
popping up.
</P>
<P>
   Opportunity arises especially when an out-of-town buyer swoops
in and purchases regional banks with deep roots in a community.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get an out-of-town bank buying an in-town bank, the
(merged bank) might not serve all parts of the market. So niche
players arise,'' said Keith Leggett, senior economist for the
American Bankers Association. ``A lot of banking is still
relationship building. Small businesses especially will look at
someone who understands the marketplace.''
</P>
<P>
   He said new community banks and thrifts tend to be small and
``high touch,'' industry jargon for plenty of personal service.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with a bigger institution is the tendency to take a
cookie-cutter approach to areas with temperaments as different as
Los Angeles and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big banks have to put people into a round hole and if you're a
square peg, you don't fit,'' said James ``JP'' Gough, director for
strategic planning and mergers and acquisition in banking at
Deloitte &AMP; Touche in Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   In San Diego County in the early 1990s, he said, many banks were
acquired or had collapsed. These institutions had provided small
business loans, jobs and charitable funds to the community. When
the remaining players became bigger, the frequency of start-up
businesses dropped.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (the smaller banks) disappeared, no more local banks were
willing to bet on small local businesses. The local guy can't
compete with the big guy on credit,'' he said. ``Big banks want
your balance sheet to be perfect. (In effect), you have to
demonstrate that you don't need the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Add this to the formula -- at any given point 25 percent of an
institution's customers aren't satisfied -- and enterprising new
bankers have enough on their plate to lure away business.
</P>
<P>
   And lure they do. Gough has known bankers to go door-to-door
dropping off business cards, although for former banking executives
the more common way is to take clients from the previous employer
who downsized or retired them.
</P>
<P>
   In Kourounis' case, his first taste of a big bank merger came
when First Interstate bought his employer in 1994. The former
senior vice president at First State Bank of the Oaks moved to
First Interstate, as vice president of corporate banking for the
Western region.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Wells Fargo came a-courting and married First
Interstate. But this time, he had reservations about changing jobs
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't sure that's where my heart was,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kourounis and his wife discussed the possibility of starting a
new bank. They gave themselves six months to gauge interest and
ability to raise capital.
</P>
<P>
   In three months, they got enough positive feedback to give it a
shot. They put together a board of directors from the community,
not venture capitalists.
</P>
<P>
   They needed $5 million to start, but were able to raise $5.7
million in four months from 450 shareholders. The 10 directors put
$1.2 million in the pot.
</P>
<P>
   Kourounis' secret weapon is personal service and accessibility.
He recognizes that he can't compete with the big institutions when
it comes to the technology race, such as the number of ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   But he argues that big banks charge fees with a lower level of
service -- if you have to pay fees anyway, why not get personal
service for which you paid, he asks rhetorically.
</P>
<P>
   Since California Oaks opened in February, assets have reached
$26 million with 2,100 accounts, helped by ads, marketing and
word-of-mouth recommendations. But ultimately, Kourounis believes a
personal touch made the difference -- such as a children's play
corner next to the new accounts section.
</P>
<P>
   As head of a 17-employee operation, customers are sometimes
startled to hear him answer the phone. When asked why, he simply
says: ``It was my turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, customers can talk to the president directly. They can
even order him around, as one client stranded at the Sacramento
airport did.
</P>
<P>
   She needed the bank to wire money to a credit card account so a
rental car company would accept the card. In half an hour, it was
all set up.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't have to call a branch manager who needed to get
approval,'' said Kourounis, who handled the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   California Oaks hopes to build its success on a good reputation.
It seems fitting that its operations are growing in an office that
echoes with the ghosts of banks past, as a symbol of new life.
</P>
<P>
   The office started out as the regional headquarters for First
Federal Savings of Santa Monica, which was bought by Home Savings
of America. Most recently, it was the home of Long Beach Savings,
which also was purchased by Home Savings.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby are buildings that at one time or another housed branches
of American Savings Bank, Coast Savings, Great Western and Home
Savings. They were all bought by Washington Mutual.
</P>
<P>
   California Oaks' only locally based rival is Los Robles Bank,
which is also headquartered in the Conejo Valley, northwest of Los
Angeles County. The area's other banks are branches of Wells Fargo,
Sanwa and Bank of America.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the California Oaks' slogan: ``We have our roots where
others have their branches.''

GIANTS END BRONCOS' PERFECT SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WENDELL BARNHOUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Nick Buoniconti and Dick Anderson have
this tradition. Each season, after the NFL's last undefeated team
loses, the former Miami Dolphins teammates share a bottle of
champagne.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the cork can pop at Buoniconti's Miami home. The Dolphins'
status as the NFL's only perfect team is still intact.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Giants (6-8) ruined Denver's undefeated season here
yesterday with a 20-16 victory over the defending Super Bowl
champions. Kent Graham's 37-yard touchdown pass to Amani Toomer
with 48 seconds remaining left the Broncos with a 13-1 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main goal is to try to win the world championship again,''
said Denver quarterback John Elway, who was 19-of-36 for 180 yards
and no touchdowns. ``If the undefeated season came with that, fine.
But the undefeated season doesn't come before the bigger goal.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham out-Elwayed Elway. He was 21-of-33 for 265 yards and two
touchdowns. And his game-winning throw was one of those
last-second, fourth-quarter miracles that the Denver quarterback
has patented.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about it before the game that it might come down to
a two-minute drive and if we get a shot to go deep on them, Amani
would be the guy,'' Graham said. ``It turned out to be true.''
</P>
<P>
   With a first-and-10 at the Denver 37, the Giants were nearing
game-tying field goal range. Graham had the option of a short pass
to improve field goal position or an end zone heave.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had two options,'' Giants coach Jim Fassel said of Graham.
``It depended on the matchups and coverages. Kent likes to throw
for Toomer because he's made some big plays for him.''
</P>
<P>
   From the shotgun, Graham threw in the end zone for Toomer, who
caught the pass over Denver's Tito Paul and then fell out of the
end zone. Officials Kirk Dornan and David Warden huddled briefly
before Dornan threw up his arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other guy (Dornan) came in and overruled him (Warden),''
said Denver safety Tyrone Braxton, who protested the call. ``It
looked like he had his feet in. I was complaining that he pushed
off.''
</P>
<P>
   New York had just enough offense and plenty of defense. The
Broncos entered the game averaging 33.5 points per game. The
Giants' aggressive defense not only harrassed Elway, it also was
able to prevent him from making big plays; his longest completion
was for 20 yards.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Broncos controlled the ball, they did little with
it. Their first nine points came as a result of 44 plays; their
only touchdown came on a seven-play drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew coming in it wouldn't be a walk over,'' said Elway,
who is 1-4 against the Giants. ``And by us not getting in the end
zone early, it really hurt us. Taking the threes instead of getting
the sevens really hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver, which scored late in the fourth quarter to beat Kansas
City last week, nearly reprised that script. Running back Terrell
Davis (147 yards on 28 carries) scored on a 27-yard run with 4:08
remaining to give Denver a 16-13 lead.
</P>
<P>
   And, after the Graham-Toomer connection, the Broncos had one
more shot. Elway's final Hail Mary pass fell incomplete in the
Giants end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``With John Elway on the field, I knew it wasn't over until that
last pass hit the ground,'' Fassel said. ``With Denver, you never,
ever, ever think you've got 'em until it's really over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this Giants team will be remembered for this victory.
And all those Dolphins players from 1972, they can ship their
champagne here.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Prominent Republicans, some of whom complained that
their leaders badly mishandled the White House scandal all year
long, now say the party's march toward impeachment would cause no
lasting political damage.
</P>
<P>
   Republican governors, state party leaders and strategists around
the country said in interviews that the stakes were far lower than
they were in the fall because there were no looming elections.
</P>
<P>
   Dismissing polls showing that the public overwhelmingly does not
want President Clinton impeached, many Republicans argue that
Americans have short attention spans and will be utterly
uninterested in rehashing the impeachment debate when presidential
and congressional elections take place in two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the election were a week from now, this probably wouldn't
be a plus for Republicans,'' said retiring Gov. Jim Edgar of
Illinois. ``But if you look at the year 2000, I don't believe what
happens in the House Judiciary Committee or the House or the Senate
is going to have as much impact as the speculation is today.''
</P>
<P>
   Such newfound confidence among Republicans _ which others in the
party warn could be the political version of whistling past the
graveyard _ is all the more remarkable because most ascribed their
dispiriting election results last month to the party's perceived
preoccupation with the scandal. But the lack of greater concern
about political fallout helps explain why many of the party's
lawmakers have plunged ahead with the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Insisting that impeachment would be far from voters' minds by
the year 2000, former Sen. Alan Simpson, a Wyoming Republican who
heads the Institute of Politics at Harvard University, said: ``The
attention span of Americans is, `Which movie is coming out next
month?' and whether the quarterly report on their stock will
change.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, who had chastised congressional
Republicans for not pressing other issues during the campaign, is
nevertheless skeptical that the scandal would again backfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear people predicting a rash of Republican upsets if the
Republicans vote for impeachment, that they would lose the majority
of the House of Representatives in the year 2000,'' Ridge said. ``I
don't necessarily share that view.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Stone, a Republican strategist who was an adviser to
Richard Nixon, said the former president enjoyed respectable job
approval ratings ``the day they threw him out.'' So, Stone added,
``it's a mistake to judge the long-term effects of public opinion
in a maelstrom of the storm because they'll shift again over
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting early polls showing that Gov. George W. Bush of Texas
would defeat Vice President Al Gore for president in 2000, Stone
said, ``If this were such a problem, if there were a generic
negative in being a Republican, why does George Bush continue to
lead Al Gore?''
</P>
<P>
   The unexpected calmness of many Republicans is based on their
assumption _ right or wrong _ that if the House voted to impeach
Clinton, the Senate would not carry it out and the president would
not ultimately be ousted from office.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans also argue that Clinton's sustained high
job-approval ratings do not tell the full story. They contend there
is little good will toward the president in either party and that
Americans would come to understand that Republicans were only
fulfilling their obligation in taking up impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Yet other Republicans fear that the complacency in the party
could be dangerous: They warn that if there was a protracted trial
in the Senate, the matter could backfire and Republicans could be
portrayed as fixated on destroying Clinton to the exclusion of the
pressing issues facing the nation.
</P>
<P>
   They could also be accused of caving to the party's right wing.
A poll last week conducted by The Wall Street Journal found that
the Republican Party had slipped to its lowest level of popularity
since the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Former Sen. Warren Rudman of New Hampshire, for one, predicted
that if Clinton was impeached and convicted by the Senate,
Republicans would lose control of the House and Senate in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of examples of politicians' or parties' being
haunted by actions of years past. For example, shortly after he
took office in 1974, President Ford pardoned Nixon. Many voters
never forgave Ford, and he lost to Jimmy Carter two years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that they're trying to get it all done before the end
of the year is probably a wise move that gives them a couple years
to be very engaged in policy issues,'' said former Rep. Mickey
Edwards, an Oklahoma Republican who now teaches at Harvard
University. But Edwards warned that there could be enduring
political damage if some party leaders persisted with brazen talk
of ousting the president and if Republicans ``continue to be
perceived as very partisan.''
</P>
<P>
   Some moderate Republicans, particularly in the Northeast, have
also been outspoken in urging House Republicans not to impeach the
president. They have warned that the inquiry could haunt the party
just as it did in November. Gov. George Pataki of New York is
planning to begin traveling the country to promote alternatives to
what he said were the party's failed strategies this year.
</P>
<P>
   Most influential Republicans concede that they do not expect the
party to benefit from the inquiry. That is why the Republican
National Committee has gone out of its way to keep a low profile
and not be identified with the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   But while several of the Republicans interviewed said they
expected that the party would suffer short-term damage from the
inquiry, most expressed confidence that it would not be lasting.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Gillespie, a strategist who is close to several leading House
Republicans, offered this assessment: ``We're better off as a party
with the short-term damage that will result from moving forward out
of principle than with the long-term damage that would result from
quitting out of political calculation. When we have a front-runner
and a standard-bearer, the party will be cast in that person's
image, not in the Judiciary Committee's image.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Several other Republicans agreed that they could now risk
looking even worse if they did not act, and would particularly
alienate the party's conservative base. Speaking with a sense of
resignation, some Republicans said they had come to believe that if
anything, the party would be viewed as failing to fulfill its
obligations if it did not pursue the impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike in the Watergate years, the principle of honesty and
integrity in government is now a Republican issue,'' said John
McLaughlin, a Republican pollster. ``If they surrender it, they're
surrendering an important principle that will discourage their base
of support.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Republicans' poor performance in the November
elections, McLaughlin said, Republicans should take heart because
the outcome underscored how political dynamics could shift quickly
and unexpectedly.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the last election proved is that voters have really short
memories,'' McLaughlin said, adding that there might have been a
Republican landslide had the election taken place in August, after
Clinton admitted that he had misled the public about his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Henry McMaster, chairman of the Republican Party in South
Carolina, was particularly blunt, saying: ``Any Republican who
doesn't vote for impeachment is going to have a lot of explaining
to do. There would be a serious backlash.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Stephen Goldsmith of Indianapolis said that with the
elections so far off, it was critical for the party not to be
lulled into thinking it did not have to develop new issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The party, either way, can survive on the impeachment issue,''
Goldsmith said, ``if it has some other agenda that affects the
quality of peoples' lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans agree that that the best thing for the party is
to move the impeachment inquiry with as much dispatch as possible.
But even if the inquiry continued month after month, Rusty Paul,
chairman of the Georgia Republican Party, said he was unconvinced
that the matter would hurt Republicans much more than Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it drags on for another year or so,'' Paul said, ``people
will say, `A pox on both of your houses.'''
</P>
<P>
   Republican after Republican discounted the long-term impact of
the inquiry, and said only the most panicked partisans should be
worried.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I would watch is the passage of time,'' said Rich Bond, a
former Republican Party chairman. ``There's room for swings in
public opinion to come to our favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Sutherland, a Republican national committeeman from
Kansas, said the lines had already been drawn and that voters in
two years would not very likely be swayed on either side over how
the impeachment matter was carried out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is danger,'' Sutherland said. ``We're going to be
pilloried by the networks and respectable print journalists. But
the alternative, which is selling your soul, is so much worse.''

IN JERUSALEM, CLINTON CONFERS WITH ANOTHER BESIEGED LEADER

 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Stone-faced and subdued, President Clinton flatly
denied Sunday that he had committed perjury, as he reluctantly
interrupted his efforts to rescue the Middle East peace plan he
cherishes to address an impeachment vote that he said he could not
control.
</P>
<P>
   In answer to reporters' questions here, the president called his
deposition in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct case ``difficult
and ambiguous and unhelpful,'' but beyond that expressed none of
the remorse that filled his remarks at the White House on Friday
about his affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   At his side, Israel's equally grim and even more embattled
leader, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, unavailingly implored
reporters to ask about Clinton's ``very clear voyage of peace.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to know the answers too,'' he added, not entirely
kindly.
</P>
<P>
   It was in supporting Clinton's plans for peace that Netanyahu
sacrificed his right-wing support and jeopardized his own hold on
power.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, in an extraordinary political tableau, the two men
seemed far apart and the peace initiative in doubt as each tried to
grapple with a complex interplay of domestic and foreign concerns _
and of self-interest, high purpose and power.
</P>
<P>
   In a round of meetings, speeches and ceremonial stops, Clinton
focused on progress toward peace, believing as ever, aides said,
that success at his policy goals would win him support at home. But
a pugnacious reception from Netanyahu made those goals seem
distant.
</P>
<P>
   While he said that the coming Congressional vote on impeachment
was ``out of my hands,'' Clinton was clearly not indifferent to it.
Sunday morning after midnight, once he reached his hotel, he made
calls to two Democratic members of the House Judiciary Committee to
assess the situation, advisers said.
</P>
<P>
   Later Sunday, he made his most forthright appeal that the House
of Representatives consider censure as an alternative, saying that
``somewhere around three-quarters of the American people think
that's the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   But speaking in combative terms, he dismissed calls by
Republican moderates _the same people who might support censure _
for an admission that he had lied under oath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not admit to doing something that I am quite sure I
did not do,'' he said. Two of the four articles of impeachment
accuse him of committing perjury, but Clinton said that ``no
credible argument'' demonstrated that he had done so.
</P>
<P>
   His aides in Washington are scrambling to line up votes against
impeachment, but Clinton said Sunday that he would make no calls to
Republican members. He will talk to them if they seek him out, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's going to happen,'' he said. ``That's up to
them.''
</P>
<P>
   On his fourth trip to Israel as president, Clinton brought some
wavering congressmen with him, including two Republican members of
the House. He met with the group Sunday morning, but they discussed
only the Middle East, said the White House press secretary, Joseph
Lockhart.
</P>
<P>
   Lockhart said the president was not preoccupied with the coming
impeachment vote: ``I can tell you, thankfully, his ability to
concentrate on the peace process is not predicated on reporters'
questions to him. That's a very small part of the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Traveling with his wife and daughter, Clinton began his day with
breakfast with Netanyahu and ended it at an official dinner beside
him. In between, the leaders alternated visions of the
Palestinians' commitment to peace. On Monday, Clinton will visit
Palestinian-controlled territory in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu accused the Palestinians of complying with none of the
commitments they made after marathon negotiations led by Clinton at
Maryland's Wye River Plantation in October. He has refused to cede
more land to the Palestinians until they comply.
</P>
<P>
   The president saw more progress. ``The Palestinian Authority has
taken some important steps,'' he said. But, he said, ``They
certainly could be doing better to preempt violent demonstrations
in the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Believing that symbols are substance here, Clinton paid careful
attention to ceremony. Surrounded by children, he joined President
Ezer Weizman in lighting the first candle of Hanukkah.
</P>
<P>
   And wearing a navy blue yarmulke on his silver hair, he silently
placed an oval stone, which the White House said was taken from Wye
River, on the tombstone of Yitzhak Rabin, the prime minister
assassinated by a right-wing Israeli radical on November 4, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Less than six weeks before that, on September 28, 1995, Rabin
shook hands at the White House with Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian
leader, over a deal broadening Palestinian self-government that the
president considers a landmark achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu repeatedly reminded Clinton of Israeli fears and
determination. At the dinner Sunday night, Netanyahu lectured on
the Jews' lonely and turbulent history, as the Israeli leaders
whose support he needs sat before him. He reminded Clinton of
ancient Jewish ties to Gaza and Bethlehem, Palestine-controlled
areas the president will visit in the next two days. Despite
Palestinian aspirations for some control of this city, he fiercely
called Jerusalem ``a city which never was and never will be the
capital of any other nation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have made excruciating sacrifices for peace,'' he said.
``We have given away parts of this land, parts which are the cradle
of our civilization.'' He said he remained committed to the peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton repeatedly affirmed the American commitment to Israeli
security. But he also promoted the Wye agreement, which calls for
Israel to withdraw in phases from another 13 percent of the West
Bank, in exchange for Palestinian steps against terrorism. In a
speech Sunday evening, he said that the peace process ``will
succeed when we understand that it is not just about mutual
obligations, but mutual interest, mutual recognition, mutual
respect.''
</P>
<P>
   As they negotiate, Clinton and Netanyahu have inverse problems
and as a result, for the moment, opposed interests: Netanyahu's
conduct of foreign policy _ specifically, his initial decision to
abide by the Wye agreement _ has threatened his domestic position;
Clinton's domestic troubles have raised questions in congressmen's
minds about his ability to conduct foreign affairs, doubts he is
trying to dispel here.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton and Netanyahu also need each other. The president is
very popular here; and Clinton has been warned that if Netanyahu's
government falls, the peace process will freeze for six months.
</P>
<P>
   In his toast Sunday night, Clinton praised Netanyahu as ``the
kind of leader with the potential to guide his people to a peaceful
and secure future.''
</P>
<P>
   And in his statement to reporters Sunday afternoon, Netanyahu
said, ``If there's anyone who can help bring the peace process to a
satisfactory conclusion, it is you, President Clinton. Your
devotion to this cause, your perseverance, your tireless energy,
your commitment have been an inspiration to us all.''

CRAIG BLACK, 66, MUSEUM CURATOR, EXPERT ON VERTEBRATE
PALEONTOLOGY

<TEXT>
<P>
   Craig Call Black, a retired museum administrator who was an
authority on ancient life forms, died on Dec. 5 at Presbyterian
Hospital in Albuquerque, N.M. He was 66 and lived in Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from lymphoma, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Black conducted vertebrate paleontology research in France,
Greece, Tunisia, Algeria and South Africa, as well as in Kenya,
where he collaborated with the anthropologist Richard Leakey.
</P>
<P>
   Black was born in Beijing, where his father was teaching
pediatrics. He received a bachelor's degree in 1954 and a master's
degree in 1957 from Amherst College, and a doctorate in biology in
1962 from Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   He began his museum career in 1960 as an assistant curator at
the Carnegie Museum of Natural History in Pittsburgh. He was
appointed curator of vertebrate paleontology in 1962 and later was
director of the Carnegie Museum for seven years.
</P>
<P>
   From 1982 to 1994, Black was the director of the Natural History
Museum of Los Angeles County.
</P>
<P>
   He was appointed by President Reagan to the National Museum
Services Board in 1982 and then to the National Science Board,
which made him chairman of its committees on international science
programs, global environment and biodiversity.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, President Bush named Black to the Environment for the
Americas Board. He was also a past president of the American
Association of Museums.
</P>
<P>
   Black is survived by his wife of 12 years, Mary Elizabeth King,
an anthropologist; a daughter, Lorna B. Walsh of Albuquerque; a
son, Christopher A., of Portland, Ore., and two grandchildren. He
is also survived by a former wife, Constance Hockenberry Black, of
Pittsburgh.

   GOVERNMENT TO TAKE OVER NIPPON CREDIT BANK IN JAPAN
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese government said that it would take over Nippon
Credit Bank, the nation's 14th-biggest lender, in the second bank
nationalization in as many months.
</P>
<P>
   The swiftness of the action surprised even the bank, and
analysts saw the takeover as the clearest signal yet that the
government was serious about cleaning up Japan's banks, which have
more than $600 billion in uncovered bad and risky debt.

New York market. The success of the station, one of a dozen across

   BELLSOUTH PROMOTES ITS STOCK
</P>
<P>
   Bell South has become more aggressive in promoting its stock

 &HT;    `Chemistry' helps Falcons find formula for seventh-straight win
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ The Atlanta Falcons made a lot more history on
Sunday, which has become the norm in this magical season. But all
the big numbers that added up to a 27-17 victory against the Saints
are not as important as the intangibles that make up the winningest
team in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   Jamal Anderson (27 rushes for 148 yards) set a Falcons record
with his 10th game of more than 100 yards; Chris Chandler threw for
345 yards, his best game with the Falcons; Terance Mathis caught
six passes for a team-record 198 yards and two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   The offense got 504 yards, a season-high, against a Saints
defense that last surrendered a touchdown at home on Oct. 11 and
held three straight opponents to a field goal each. The Falcons'
defense allowed the Saints 216 yards _ the fourth straight game an
opponent has been held to less than 245 _ and gave up only a field
goal.
</P>
<P>
   The only other time the Falcons (12-2) won this many games was
1980, the same year they won their only NFC West title. They can
sew up a second _ and a bye in the first round of the playoffs _ if
San Francisco (10-3) loses tonight to Detroit or if Atlanta wins
next Sunday at Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   What matters most, though, was the sight of free safety Eugene
Robinson putting his arm around Chandler as the two walked off the
field, the defensive quarterback hugging the offensive quarterback,
and whispering in his ear: ``Way to throw the ball, man. You were
great.''
</P>
<P>
   All around them in the Superdome, teammates were tossing gloves,
wristbands and bandanas to some of the many Atlanta fans who
watched the Falcons win their seventh straight game overall and
eighth straight against the Saints.
</P>
<P>
   There is an aura surrounding this team, a chemistry, a
camaraderie, something much bigger than any individual record.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to give a guy a pat on the back. That's the kind of
stuff nobody talks about,'' said Robinson, who recovered a fumble
to set up Atlanta's first touchdown and later had one of three
Atlanta interceptions. ``We've really got chemistry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably one of the reasons we're doing as well as we
are,'' assistant head coach/defensive coordinator Rich Brooks said.
``Because these guys really are playing as a team, and that's hard
to accomplish in the era of free agency and big-money players vs.
little-money players, and guys changing teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Some things did go haywire for the Falcons. Chandler had an
interception and fumble returned for touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   But Atlanta's defense made sure New Orleans (6-8) rarely had a
chance.
</P>
<P>
   Four of the Saints' first five possessions ended in turnovers.
The Falcons reversed their recent trend of falling behind early by
taking a 14-0 first-quarter lead on a 1-yard run by fullback Bob
Christian, and a 62-yard pass to Mathis, who suffered a busted lip
on he play.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very physical football game, which is the way we
expected it would be,'' coach Dan Reeves said. ``I thought our guys
did a really good job of coming out and being physical from the
start. If you enjoy hard-nosed football, you had to enjoy that
one.''
</P>
<P>
   The Saints' defense pulled them back in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie nickel back Fred Weary returned his second interception
of the game 63 yards for a touchdown to cut Atlanta's lead to 14-7
with 1:25 left in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Saints' new ``Bear'' defense, which basically features a
defender opposite every Atlanta lineman plus blitzing linebackers,
caused occasional problems, because Chandler was harassed most of
the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   When the Saints blitzed early in the third quarter, linebacker
Keith Mitchell leveled Chandler, and linebacker Mark Fields
returned a fumble 36 yards to pull cut the lead to 17-14.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler re-sprained the ankle he injured two weeks ago late in
the third quarter and had to be helped from the field. He returned,
but not long after that, Christian, an immensely valuable part of
the offense, suffered what is believed to be a season-ending knee
injury early in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The final big play came when Chandler hit Mathis on a post
route, and Mathis made a nice move on Saints strong safety Chad
Cota to complete a 63-yard touchdown play for a 27-17 lead with
6:50 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what you do against a defense that is attacking you,''
Chandler said. ``You attack back with routes like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson rushed five times for 49 yards to run out the final
3:06 against a defense that a week ago held the Dallas Cowboys to 8
rushing yards.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis, though, was the big-play man.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, team president Taylor Smith hugged him, whispering,
``You were great man. I loved it.''
</P>
<P>
   For the Falcons, there has been a lot of that going around.

   LOS ALAMOS, N.M. _ Just as Rep. Bill Redmond faces one of the
most crucial votes of his brief career in Congress, the New Mexico
Republican has seen the number of telephone lines in his office
plummet from one dozen to one.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a debate on Thursday on the impeachment of President
Clinton, Redmond is deprived of the standard gauge of public
opinion _ the tally of constituent telephone calls. After losing
last month's election to Tom Udall, a Democrat, Redmond closed his
offices in Santa Fe and in Washington. And he was downgraded last
week to a cubicle in a basement room for lame-duck congressmen.
There, he said he works with a desk, a computer ``without a
printer'' and one telephone with an answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   But impeachment should not be decided by opinion polls,
cautioned Redmond, one of several dozen representatives who have
not announced how they will vote on impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything characterizes my approach to the decision I will
make Thursday, it is that I am very dispassionate about it, I am
hyperrational,'' Redmond, a 44-year-old political conservative,
said Saturday over a bottle of a root beer in a doughnut shop here.
``You don't draw all your hypothesis until you have all the data,
and we don't have all the data.''
</P>
<P>
   Redmond said he planned to study the impeachment process
intently before Thursday's vote. That process, he said, is little
understood, even by America's most educated citizens. Noting the
high concentration here of scientists involved in nuclear weapons
research, the congressman said, ``You have more Ph.D.s per capita
in Los Alamos than anywhere else in the nation, but I don't think
that one out of 100 understand impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a few hours before the first committee votes, Redmond
helped open a new homeless center in Santa Fe, a liberal city that
voted against him last month by a 3-to-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each person who spoke with me told me personally, to my face,
said that I should vote for impeachment,'' he recalled Saturday.
``I've got Democrats coming up to me, with red faces, saying `What
am I going to tell my kids?'''
</P>
<P>
   Redmond, who has a master's degree in philosophy of science, has
consistently voted with the Republican majority during his one term
in Congress. A former minister at the Santa Fe Christian Church,
Redmond was dismissive of the president's most recent plea for
forgiveness, made Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is no clear direct object, how could there be
forgiveness?'' he asked, recalling the practice in his church of
asking forgiveness for specific transgressions. ``He wants
forgiveness, but for what?''
</P>
<P>
   As Christmas carols played in the doughnut shop's jukebox and
aluminum-foil snowflakes twinkled from the ceiling, the congressman
cited an Old Testament parable to say that ``forgiveness does not
mean not having to live the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Switching to the modern language of therapy, from his days as a
marriage and drug counselor, he said, ``The president is calling on
the nation to share his victimization.''
</P>
<P>
   In conclusion, he said the president would be better off with
``tough love.''
</P>
<P>
   At the shop counter, opinions were divided.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Duncan, a bed-and-breakfast owner from Taos, a Democratic
bastion, was ordering a cup of hot cocoa, with whipped cream on
top.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm embarrassed, disgusted, outraged _ but I'm not saying I
want everything disrupted,'' Ms. Duncan said, referring to the
president's affair with Monica Lewinsky. Referring to the recent
impeachment flare-up, she said: ``It's running away with us. The
people don't have a say.''
</P>
<P>
   But Veta Floyd, the owner of the shop, Daylight Doughnuts,
voiced an opinion more in line with Los Alamos, a conservative
community that voted heavily for Redmond last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Justice needs to be done,'' she said, preparing an espresso
almost exactly at the time the Judiciary Committee in Washington
was voting the fourth article of impeachment. ``It doesn't matter
what the public thinks. We have rules to follow. We have a
Constitution.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Gov. Lawton Chiles, a homespun centrist politician from the
middle of Florida who served three terms as a Democratic senator
and was elected to two terms as governor, died Saturday at the
Governor's Mansion in Tallahassee. He was 68.
</P>
<P>
   Chiles died from an abnormal heart rhythm, a medical examiner
told The Associated Press. The governor, who had a history of heart
trouble, was found by a Florida law-enforcement agent next to an
exercise bicycle, where he was pronounced dead.
</P>
<P>
   Chiles was to have left office in January, after his successor,
Jeb Bush, was inaugurated. Chiles was barred by law from serving a
third term. Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay, who lost to Bush last month, was
sworn in to complete Chiles' term.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of the stature Chiles accrued during four decades in
politics, the House Judiciary Committee paused on Saturday to honor
Chiles during debate of a resolution to censure President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In 12 years as a state legislator in Tallahassee, 18 years in
Washington and eight years as governor, Chiles earned a reputation
as a lawmaker deeply concerned about the environment and the fiscal
responsibility of government.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, he focused on what he called ``government in the
sunshine.'' He was the chief sponsor of a 1976 federal law
requiring regulatory agencies to conduct their meetings in public.
And he pressed with some success for similar openness in
congressional committee hearings and for requirements that
officeholders disclose personal and campaign financial information,
as well as similar rules for lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   Chiles was also the main sponsor of the Federal Paperwork
Reduction Act of 1980, and carried on this cause as governor by
proposing the repeal of half of Florida's 28,750 state regulations
by the end of 1996. He began by issuing executive orders removing
several thousand regulations and replacing them where deemed
necessary with looser common-sense ``guidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   He retired from the Senate at the end of his third term in 1988,
``burned out,'' in his words, by the impasses he had encountered in
the two years he served as chairman of the budget committee. His
efforts to achieve a bipartisan consensus on where and how much to
cut federal spending were undercut by both Republicans and fellow
Democrats eager to preserve certain projects, and by officials in
the Reagan administration.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, depression was diagnosed in Chiles. Around that time,
he had been taking part in negotiations to stem the growth of the
federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``I began to see the president wasn't serious, the speaker
wasn't serious, the majority leader wasn't serious,'' he said. ``It
was all a charade. I just wanted to scream, `This is a fraud!' But
I helped to create it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiles spoke of his depressive period as ``not the blues, but
the blacks, the black blacks.'' He couldn't digest food properly
and developed insomnia. One day, after being shown a calendar
jammed with appointments, he told his Senate staff, ``I can't see
anything here that I want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   His successful medical treatment included Prozac, then a new
antidepressant.
</P>
<P>
   Having recovered by the spring of 1990, he re-entered politics,
ran for governor and, by a vote of 57 percent to 43 percent,
defeated a one-term Republican, Gov. Bob Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   During Chiles' nearly 40 years in public office, the population
of Florida doubled to 14 million; in the same period, the state's
political profile shifted from Deep South Democrat to an almost
equal division of Democrats and Republicans. Noting this change, he
described the new Florida as ``more a crowd than a community.''
</P>
<P>
   But having early acquired a reputation for probity, the
soft-spoken Chiles never lost an election. Noting the absence of
scandal or indications of misuse of office in his career, David
Schultz wrote in The Ledger, the daily newspaper of Chiles'
hometown, Lakeland, ``It's refreshing and rare to find such
integrity in public office.''
</P>
<P>
   Chiles was an unknown state Senator when he entered national
politics in 1970 after Spessard Holland, then Florida's senior
senator, decided to retire. Chiles attracted attention by
conducting a ``shoe leather, shoestring campaign,'' walking the
length of the state, 1,003 miles in three months.
</P>
<P>
   Chiles refused campaign contributions of more than $10 (in later
contests he raised this to $100). In the Democratic primary runoff
he beat a former governor with nearly 69 percent of the vote. In
the general election, ``Walkin' Lawton,'' as he was then known,
upset Republican Rep. William Cramer, winning nearly 54 percent of
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Chiles' vote totals remained high thereafter: 63 percent in the
1976 senatorial race, 62 percent in 1982. After defeating Martinez
in 1990 he sought re-election in 1994 and, defying a Republican
tide that swept the nation, defeated Bush, the son of former
President George Bush, by 51 percent to 49 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As senator, Chiles successfully fought a project to dig a barge
canal across Florida. In 1974 he sponsored legislation creating the
Big Cypress National Preserve, a 574,000-acre preserve that helps
control water flow to the Everglades. And he opposed phosphate
strip mining in the Osceola National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   As governor, one of Chiles' most notable achievements was in
campaign financing, pushing through legislation requiring public
money for candidates running for state offices.
</P>
<P>
   He also became a leader in encouraging litigation against the
tobacco industry, first by sponsoring a law that permitted the
filing of lawsuits against cigarette manufacturers and then filing
such a lawsuit on behalf of the state in 1995. That suit, which
sought to recoup the costs of treating Medicaid patients suffering
from smoking-related diseases, culminated in 1997 in a $11.3
billion settlement to be paid over 25 years. He also advocated
health-care reform and adamantly opposed federal restrictions on
benefits for legal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Lawton Mainor Chiles Jr. was born April 3, 1930, in Lakeland.
His father was a railroad conductor. After attending public
schools, he graduated from the University of Florida in Gainesville
in 1952, and served in the Army as an artillery lieutenant in Korea
in 1953 and 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Chiles returned to the University of Florida and received a law
degree in 1955. He was elected to the Florida House of
Representatives in 1958 and served four consecutive two-year terms;
he was elected to the state Senate and served from 1966 to 1970.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, the former Rhea May Grafton; two
sons, Lawton III and Edward G.; two daughters, Tandy M. and Rhea
Gay, and 10 grandchildren.

MORRIS UDALL, FORMER LIBERAL CONSCIENCE OF THE HOUSE, DIES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Colo., Mass., Ga., Alaska, N.H.)   (Eds.: Longer version has moved as OBIT-UDALL.) 
(jw) 
 By RICHARD SEVERO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Morris Udall of Arizona, a liberal conscience of the House of
Representatives for 30 years and a tireless advocate for
environmental protection and political reform, died late Saturday
in Washington. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   Udall died of complications from Parkinson's disease, according
to the Morris K. Udall Foundation in Tucson, Ariz. First diagnosed
in 1980, the disease led to Udall's resignation from Congress in
1991. He spent the final stage of his life in a veterans hospital
in Washington, seldom conscious.
</P>
<P>
   Udall was one of those rare figures who flourished even though
his politics frequently did not square with the views of many of
his constituents, known for their conservatism and support of Sen.
Barry Goldwater. But from the time Udall was first elected in 1961
in Arizona's 2nd Congressional District until his retirement, they
voted for him in overwhelming numbers and did not seem to care
about his high ratings from liberal groups and unions.
</P>
<P>
   Arizonans identified with Udall's unabashed love of unspoiled
nature, and they applauded his efforts to create safeguards for the
environment, including curbs on strip mining and legislation to
protect Alaskan wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Udall's supporters came to believe that the 6-foot-5, one-time
Denver Nuggets basketball player might be a viable presidential
candidate. Udall believed it, too, hoping his reputation for
honesty would help him become the nation's first elected
post-Watergate president. But in 1976 he finished second in six
Democratic primaries, losing the nomination to Gov. Jimmy Carter of
Georgia. Udall's liberal positions, including support for a
national health insurance program, were too extreme for his party
and he lacked the name recognition and money to finance his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Udall considered running again in 1980, because he did not
believe that Carter could defeat Ronald Reagan. But mindful of
questions about his health, he supported Sen. Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass. Udall had disclosed that he had Parkinson's disease, a
progressive disorder often characterized by tremors, stiffness of
muscles and a deterioration of certain functions of the brain.
Despite his condition, Udall remained active in the House for
another decade.
</P>
<P>
   In his years in Congress, he fought for the environment, urged
curbs on tobacco products, favored cutting the national debt and
pushed for campaign reform and disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, he disclosed his finances and put his income tax
returns in open files. He gave up his law practice and did not keep
outside sources of income. And, he played a key role in drafting
and passing the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Morris King Udall was born June 15, 1922, in St. John's, Ariz.,
the son of Levi and Louise Lee Udall. A great-grandfather had led
the first Mormons into Arizona from Utah. His father started out
digging ditches, achieved success as a farmer, took law-school
correspondence courses and served for 16 years on the Arizona
Supreme Court. Udall's mother wrote ``Mine and Me,'' a story of a
Hopi woman.
</P>
<P>
   Morris Udall had two brothers and two sisters. One brother,
Stewart, was elected to Congress and served until he was appointed
secretary of the interior in President John Kennedy's Cabinet.
Morris Udall won the election to fill the seat.
</P>
<P>
   At age 5, Mo Udall's right eye was accidentally injured by a
playmate. But Levi Udall was still struggling and did not have
enough money to obtain decent medical care for his son. Soon, the
eye became infected and it was lost. Udall said the experience help
mold him, and he fought for the right of all Americans to have
quality care regardless of ability to pay.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from high school in 1940, Udall entered the
University of Arizona, but then maneuvered his way into the Army,
serving in the South Pacific and achieving the rank of captain in
the Army Air Corps in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, he returned to the University of Arizona, where he was
student body president and co-captain and all-conference forward in
basketball. He also played briefly with the Denver Nuggets, but his
athletic career was set aside in 1949, with the beginning of his
legal and political career.
</P>
<P>
   He was elected chief deputy attorney for Pima County in 1950 and
later was elected county attorney before going to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by Norma Gilbert, his third wife; by his four
brothers and sisters, and by his six children.
</P>
<P>
   Before illness took its toll, Udall enjoyed creating his own
constituent newsletters, which were published in 1972 as ``The
Education of a Congressman.'' His witticisms were the subject of
another book, ``Too Funny to be President,'' published after his
presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the House Post Office Committee, he would joke:
``Let's turn inflation over to the Post Office. That'll slow it
down.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was seeking the presidential nomination, he told
audiences of the time he stopped in a New Hampshire barbershop,
announced who he was and what he was running for, and was told by a
patron, ``Yep, we were just laughing about that yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of his life, Michael Lewis , a New York Times
Magazine columnist, found that Sen. John McCain, the conservative
Republican from Arizona, was one of Udall's few visitors at the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mo reached out to me in 50 different ways,'' McCain told
Lewis. When McCain was first elected, he said, Udall took the young
congressman in hand despite their ideological differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way Mo could have been more wonderful,'' McCain
said. ``And there was no reason for him to be that way.'' Whenever
he takes the Senate floor on behalf of American Indians or argues
that the Republican Party should support environmentalism, McCain
said, he remembers his debt to Mo Udall.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By EDDIE SEFKO  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
MELBOURNE, Australia _ The aftermath of America's loss at the
Presidents Cup was predictable. After getting outplayed for three
days, the U.S. players summarized the story by saying they got
``outlucked,'' too.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Several members of the losing American team thought it was bad
karma that cost them more than their own play. It was an excuse
quickly pooh-poohed by the victors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ask the golfing gods,'' said Tiger Woods when asked about the
smashing performance by the International team. ``We played some
pretty good golf. But when a team holes out from 40 feet or chips
in or makes it from the fairway, what are you going to do? It just
happened to be that way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans were pounded 20{ to 11{ by an International team
that got classic efforts from unlikely sources like always-smiling
Japanese player Shigeki Maruyama and from thoroughbreds like Greg
Norman and Steve Elkington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a lack of heart or a lack of desire or a lack of
determination on our part,'' said Mark O'Meara. ``We just got
outplayed. Whether it's been the Ryder Cup or the Presidents Cup,
the other team has risen to the occasion recently.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara and his teammates also pointed to the team's collective
bad putting as a culprit for the poor showing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did we putt bad?'' O'Meara said. ``I don't know that we putted
bad. But we could have putted better.''
</P>
<P>
   To an International team that will never forget what happened in
1996, when Fred Couples made a staggering 30-foot putt to win the
Presidents Cup, the U.S. explanations weren't reasonable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's sour grapes,'' said Frank Nobilo, who went 2-2
in his matches. ``When the same thing happened to us, nobody said
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Elkington: ``We didn't say that when Fred Couples rolled
it in from two counties away last time. We made those shots (this
time), and they didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the Internationals didn't appreciate U.S.
players saying that when they make incredible shots, it somehow
doesn't involve as much luck as when it happens to somebody else.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, this isn't the start of a Ryder Cup-style dislike
between the teams in the Presidents Cup, because the competition
over the weekend was fabulous.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard-fought on both sides. But it also featured high
respect from both teams toward each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``That U.S. team is a mighty team,'' said International captain
Peter Thomson. ``But we feel that now we're just as mighty.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the blowout results, the singles competition on the
final day was purely for entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   On a personal level, Woods won the battle, even if his team lost
the war. He went against Norman in a classic test of youth against
experience. It was the first time the pair had played together in a
tournament situation. And it was worth the wait.
</P>
<P>
   The Cup had long since been decided, but Woods and Norman took
it upon themselves to put on a riveting show.
</P>
<P>
   It ended with Woods sinking a six-footer for par to tie Norman
on the par-4 18th and earn a 1-up victory in their match in the
singles competition of the Presidents Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ended up being a great finish,'' said Woods. ``It was a
good way to end it. I played well all week, and our team played
well. Just not well enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to have that opportunity to play against one of
the game's best. He birdied five holes in a row on me, so I had to
kind of hang in there through that, and I squeaked it out at the
end.''
</P>
<P>
   The pairing of Norman and Woods was hyped throughout the week.
Unfortunately for the Americans, it lost some luster when they were
outplayed in the first two days during foursomes and fourball play.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the singles, the Internationals were ahead 14{ to 5{.
They won the first two matches in singles to secure the required
16{ points for victory.
</P>
<P>
   As Couples said about the rest of the proceedings: ``It was fun.
But it was just sort of anticlimactic.''
</P>
<P>
   The American players were waylaid early in the tournament. But
the fact that the International team won the Cup for the first time
wasn't all bad news for the U.S. team, captain Jack Nicklaus said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every sporting event, somebody's got to win and somebody's
got to lose,'' said Nicklaus. ``This week, we got beat by a better
team. They played some of the most unbelievable golf. I think if
you get the television tape of this tournament, there's no need to
make a highlight film. It was a highlight film all the way through.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in America used to think we owned the game. We didn't even
invent it. But to put a squad together like Peter (Thomson) did and
have them root for each other and win together is very, very
special.
</P>
<P>
   ``We walked away from Royal Melbourne with a new Presidents Cup
champion. And I think the game of golf is better because of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if the U.S. took another international hit. They now have
lost the last Ryder Cup, Presidents Cup, World Cup and Dunhill Cup.
</P>
<P>
   And they had a hard time believing it themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't overconfident,'' Mark Calcavecchia said. ``But it
never really dawned on me that we could lose. And the amazing thing
is that it wasn't even close. If it was one or two points'
difference, you might say it was a putt here or there.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they all played well, and I don't think anybody on our
team played really outstanding.''

IBM TO RELEASE ORIGINAL INSTRUCTIONS OF E-MAIL PROGRAM 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adding momentum to the open-source movement for the free sharing
of software, IBM plans Monday to make available the original
programmer's instructions for a new mail program that can be used
to store and forward e-mail messages with a high level of security.
</P>
<P>
   The program, Secure Mailer, serves as an electronic post office
for server computers connected to the Internet. It was developed by
Wietse Venema, an IBM researcher and computer security specialist.
Executives said they were using the free, open-source model of
software distribution to insure that the program would be widely
available on the dozens of kinds of computers that are used to
route Internet mail traffic.
</P>
<P>
   The open source model of software development, pioneered by a
loosely affiliated group of expert programmers, is built on
universal sharing of the programmer's original written instructions
to the computer. In traditional, proprietary development models,
those instructions are hidden because they have been compiled into
the binary 1s and 0s that computers understand.
</P>
<P>
   The open-source model has been gaining popularity in the last
year based on the success of the free Linux operating system, and
in recent months several major technology corporations have
endorsed part or all of the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is IBM's Christmas present to the Internet,'' said Abner
Germanow, a computer security analyst at the International Data
Corp., a market research firm. ``For these are core pieces of
software, and we're going beyond trying to make money off of them,
to the idea that by freely sharing them it will make the world a
better place.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many big companies, the International Business Machines
Corp. seems to be cautiously feeling its way toward an open-source
strategy. Secure Mailer follows by just a week the company's
release of the source code for a compiler, the tool used by
software developers to transform instructions written in a
programming language into the computer's binary machine code.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, IBM is making its software compatible with Apache,
a popular open-source Web server program, and earlier this year it
announced plans to make a version of its DB2 relational data base
program available for the open-source Linux operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still trying to understand exactly what open source
means,'' said Paul Horn, vice president for research. ``It
obviously plays an important role where standards are critical, but
what it means to IBM is still under formulation.''
</P>
<P>
   Secure Mailer offers an alternative to several other freely
available programs that route Internet mail, including Sendmail and
Q Mail, as well as to commercial programs like Microsoft's
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Currently about 70 percent of all e-mail worldwide is handled by
Sendmail, a program that has been developed over more than a decade
and supported by a programmer named Eric Allman and a loose group
of colleagues. Recently, Allman started a company to develop a
commercial version of the program.
</P>
<P>
   IBM researchers said one of the drawbacks to Sendmail was that
it had been written as a large, monolithic piece of software. As a
result it has both performance and security limitations.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Venema has developed Secure Mailer as a cluster of
modules, all of which distrust each other. This creates a more
secure program. The program could be compared to a ship that has
many independent compartments and therefore is harder to sink, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Palmer, who manages a computer security research group
at IBM's T.J. Watson Research Laboratory, said that enabling other
programmers to look at all the original instructions written by the
program's author would give them a high degree of confidence in the
security of a program.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ There may or may not be enough rebellious
Republicans to stop impeachment on the House floor this week. But
the real question is whether there are enough of them willing to
break with the rules set by their leaders for the handling of the
impeachment vote.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Robert Livingston, the speaker-designate, has vowed to
block any attempt by Democrats to offer an alternative to
impeachment, saying censure is outside the rules of the House and
an attack on House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats accused Livingston, R-La., of hiding behind
parliamentary rules that he could easily waive if he truly wanted
to give House members a ``vote of conscience,'' as he has said any
vote on impeachment should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the rawest of raw partisan politics,'' said Rep. Tom
Barrett, D-Wis. ``Mr. Livingston is not just poisoning the well,
he's poisoning the entire water supply.''
</P>
<P>
   With Republicans barricading the road to censure, House
Democrats are drafting a high-stakes parliamentary end-around that
can only succeed with the support of at least a dozen rank-and-file
Republicans. Democrats hope to convince them that Livingston is
being so unfair that they should commit political heresy and vote
to bring an alternative measure to the floor of the House.
</P>
<P>
   If the maneuver prevails, which the House parliamentarian's
office said has not happened in modern history, impeachment would
be quashed before a final vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may not let us bring up censure, but all the members,
Democratic and Republican, are going to face a procedural vote on
whether or not they want censure to come up as an alternative,''
Rep. Richard Gephardt, House minority leader, said Sunday on the
NBC News program ``Meet the Press.'' ``They're they're going to
have to face this issue, whether the Republican leadership wants
them to or not.''
</P>
<P>
   The rules of the House were set up to provide a structure for
debate among members and to ensure that unrelated issues don't bog
down bills on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, bills typically move through the relevant
committees and, if approved, are assigned a rule, or a set of
procedures, by the Rules Committee before going to the floor. These
procedures, for example, set the length of debate and whether
amendments are allowed.
</P>
<P>
   While enforced by the majority party, these rules also provide
protections for the minority, including the right to offer an
alternative to a majority-sponsored bill, even if only on a
procedural vote.
</P>
<P>
   An article of impeachment follows a slightly different track. It
is considered privileged, because once an impeachment article is
approved by the Judiciary Committee, is goes straight to the House
floor, bypassing the Rules Committee. It cannot be amended on the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston and other Republican leaders argue that because the
Judiciary Committee rejected a censure option as a part of its
impeachment resolution, that alternative cannot be considered on
the House floor. In parliamentary terms, it is not considered
germane.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say that Republicans fear that a censure alternative
would drain support away from impeachment, particularly from some
20 to 30 undeclared Republicans. ``They don't want to find a
solution other than impeachment,'' Gephardt said. ``They're
obsessed, apparently, with impeaching this president and dragging
the country through this endlessly.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is what Gephardt said he would do if Livingston did not
relent.
</P>
<P>
   Just before a final vote on each article of impeachment, the
Democrats would propose reconsidering the impeachment resolution,
but with instructions to censure the president, rather than
impeaching him. This is a motion to recommit.
</P>
<P>
   House Parliamentarian Charles Johnson would then advise Rep. Ray
LaHood, R-Ill., whom Speaker Newt Gingrich named to preside over
the impeachment vote from the speaker's chair, whether the
Democratic proposal was germane to the underlying impeachment
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   The parliamentarian is a nonpartisan position appointed by the
speaker. LaHood is not technically bound to follow the
parliamentarian's ruling, but LaHood said Sunday that he most
certainly would.
</P>
<P>
   If LaHood ruled that the Democratic proposal was not germane,
which Democrats say is almost certain to happen, they could appeal
the ruling to the full House. This would be the crucial procedural
vote, especially for the moderate Republicans who oppose
impeachment and favor censure. But the parliamentarian's office
said such a reversal has never prevailed in modern House history.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, under Gingrich's reign, it has been considered heresy
for Republicans to vote with Democrats on parliamentary votes
because it is viewed as an attack on the Republican majority.
Republican leaders would consider such a vote a more serious breach
of party unity than a vote to oppose impeachment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``That would require some Republicans to vote against their own
chair, which is a tough vote for anybody,'' Rep. Henry Hyde,
chairman of the Judiciary Committee, said on the CBS News program
``Face the Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if the parliamentarian ruled in favor of the
Democratic proposal, LaHood would face an extremely awkward
decision: Rule against the arbiter of procedure in the House or
rule against your party's leaders.
</P>
<P>
   An expert on House rules, after listening to what Gephardt was
contemplating, acknowledged that the high-risk gambit might just
work, if the wording was right. ``It might well be germane to say
impeachment is not warranted,'' said the expert, who spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   If an appeal of LaHood's negative ruling failed, a House
Democratic lawyer working on draft language said Gephardt would
likely try again, using watered-down language that might not even
mention the word censure.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, LaHood, who has a reputation for fairness, said in
an interview, ``We'll play by the rules, as spelled out by the
parliamentarian.''

GIANTS SPOIL BRONCOS-DOLPHINS SHOWDOWN

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ No doubt, the Miami Dolphins are
disappointed. In 1985, the Dolphins ended Chicago's perfect season.
And with a 13-0 record and a Monday night game at Miami looming, it
appeared Denver was heading for a similar South Florida ambush.
</P>
<P>
   And then the Broncos played the New York Giants yesterday. Final
score: Giants 20, Broncos 16. End of undefeated season. No more Big
Game in Miami between a 14-0 Denver team playing a Dolphins team
contending for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be lying if I told you we had no regrets about finally
losing and not being undefeated anymore,'' Denver linebacker Alfred
Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a chance to separate ourselves from the rest of the
league for years and years and years,'' Denver safety Tyrone
Braxton said. ``It's disappointing, it's depressing. We still
realize that our ultimate goal, which is to win the Super Bowl, is
still in front of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver's loss means that the 1972 Dolphins will remain the NFL's
only undefeated team. Miami finished 17-0 that season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really thought Denver had a shot and I was looking forward
to that game in Miami,'' former Dolphins coach Don Shula said in a
statement released after the Giants' victory. ``Their loss just
underscores how difficult it is to go undefeated.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver's loss also ended a the Broncos' chance at more history.
The NFL record for regular- and post-season victories is 18; Denver
had tied that record with last week's victory over Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knew it was going to end some time. They've done an
unbelievable job, winning a Super Bowl and then starting this year
13-0,'' Giants coach Jim Fassel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to win 18 in a row,'' said Denver quarterback John
Elway, who was limited to 180 yards passing and no touchdowns. ``It
would have been nice to break that record of winning 19 in a row,
but obviously there's a reason why somebody can't break through
that 18 barrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of our goals was to have a perfect season. Our main
concern is we want to start playing better football. The last two
weeks, we've started slow.''

LOGIC AND RHETORIC ON THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE

 By ADAM CLYMER

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The result was foreordained. The votes were
strictly partisan. And much of the debate was aimed not at the
history books, but at the 30 or fewer uncommitted members of the
House.
</P>
<P>
   But because the impeachment of a president comes along so
infrequently, the logic and the rhetoric of the House Judiciary
Committee's proceedings will inevitably be cited the next time
Congress weighs impeachment of a president _ just as this time both
sides cited as scripture the 1974 proceedings against Richard
Nixon, or at least the arguments of the winning side then.
</P>
<P>
   Three issues stand out.
</P>
<P>
   First, the committee was almost entirely guided by the referral
of Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel who has pursued President
Clinton for more than four years.
</P>
<P>
   Except for sending the president 81 questions designed to get
him to admit under oath to charges he had already denied under
oath, the committee relied entirely on Starr's evidence. To avoid
political embarrassment for themselves, neither party chose to call
and cross-examine the most obvious witnesses _ Monica Lewinsky, for
one.
</P>
<P>
   And the committee compiled its four articles of impeachment to
include each of Starr's 11 alleged crimes and nothing more, except
for proposing to impeach Clinton for sticking to his story in
answering the 81 questions. On Saturday, the committee did drop
some of Starr's weakest charges _ that Clinton had abused power by
lying to aides who then misled the public.
</P>
<P>
   In all this, except for chattering constantly to television
cameras, the committee seemed to view itself as a grand jury
deciding there was probable cause for a trial, almost on the model
described by Sol Wachtler, the former chief judge of the New York
state Court of Appeals. In 1973, he said dutiful grand juries, if
asked by a prosecutor, would ``indict a ham sandwich.''
</P>
<P>
   The second interesting idea was that, even if ultimately
unsuccessful in removing a president, impeachment served as a
deterrent to bad behavior by an ``otherwise errant president,'' as
Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., said. As authority he cited Jonathan
Turley of George Washington University Law School, who also argued
for the grand jury analogy.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan was defending a colleague, Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., who
had made the case with more flair, arguing that even if Clinton was
acquitted, ``Impeachment would satisfy those who believe the
president should be branded and given the scarlet letter.''
</P>
<P>
   This argument, though rejected by the Democrats and not advanced
by most Republicans, who said their goal was removal from office,
has even more recent parentage than the ham sandwich idea. It may
be traced to Donald Smaltz, the independent counsel whose case
against Mike Espy, the former secretary of agriculture, ended up in
acquittal on 30 counts (after dismissal of 10 more), despite his
having spent $17 million in four years. Smaltz said on Dec. 2,
``The actual indictment of a public official may in fact be as
great a deterrent as a conviction of that official.''
</P>
<P>
   Those thoughts lead back to the most serious argument about
impeachment heard all week. The best moments of debate were over
whether the committee and the House should support impeachment if
they had no hope of a conviction in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   That argument matters, even if Republicans were seeking votes on
the floor by portraying an impeachment as no more than a gesture,
and Democrats sometimes skipped over the Senate entirely and said a
vote to impeach actually removed the president.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., put one view
clearly, when he said it was not true that by voting for
impeachment ``we're throwing the president out of office.'' He
said, ``What we do is we find whether there is enough evidence to
warrant submission to the Senate for them to conduct the trial.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., said that was only technically
correct. ``The only justification for this proceeding and the only
basis on which members can honestly vote for these articles is
their belief that the president ought to be thrown out of office,''
he said. He said any lesser standard was a political effort to
gloss over the meaning of voting for the articles of impeachment,
which ended with the sentence, ``Wherefore, William Jefferson
Clinton, by such conduct, warrants impeachment and trial and
removal from office and disqualification to hold and enjoy any
office of honor, trust or profit under the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The lesser argument about responsibility has its parallels in
the way Congress does its ordinary business these days. Members
regularly offer amendments they do not believe will pass just to
set up television advertisements proclaiming that someone of the
opposite party voted for crime or drugs or whatever. Last summer
the House passed a number of bills desired by the Christian right
even though it knew the Senate would never take them up.
</P>
<P>
   That is not the case here. Even if conviction by the Senate is
almost impossible to imagine, the issue must go there if the full
House votes for it this week.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no real agreement about how sure the committee had
to be of Clinton's guilt before it voted to impeach. It was plain
the Republicans were sure he had lied under oath, and they took the
view that it was their duty to impeach and let the Senate worry
about what came next, though indeed it will be up to them, as House
managers, to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   They had no use for the argument, from prosecutors called by the
White House, that ``responsible'' people do not bring charges if
they think they cannot convict _ both because it is unfair to an
accused and because it makes criminals think they can get away with
crime. Rogan called the prosecutors' argument ``an absurdity.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all the weight members put on the issue, it was
sometimes blindingly clear that they had not done their homework
about the consequences of their votes. McCollum, for example,
astonished other members when he twice insisted that the Senate
could convict Clinton but choose not to remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   After the Constitution was read to him, he took it back.

<P>
   CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa _ The telephone would not stop ringing in the
office of Jim Leach, the longtime congressman from Iowa. And even
in this mild-mannered Midwestern state, the calls were full of
passion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a plain witch hunt,'' Joan Nielsen, a 68-year-old woman
from Center Point, wanted the congressman to know. ``They are out
to get the president no matter how they could get him. He has done
a very good job of governing, and I feel that it would be a
detriment to the country to impeach him.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, Renee Lancaster, a 42-year-old former teacher
from Hiawatha, pressed just as vehemently.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton has lied,'' Ms. Lancaster said. ``I believe he's a
criminal. He should never have been in office.''
</P>
<P>
   All week long and into the weekend the calls spilled into the
office of Leach, who has remained publicly uncommitted on whether
President Clinton should be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Like many other uncommitted Republicans, Leach represents a
district that is a melange of political views, from the liberal
powerhouse of Iowa City, home of the University of Iowa, to the
moderate and conservative views of people in working-class
Davenport and business-minded Cedar Rapids. Leach's aides said the
electorate is composed of equal numbers of Republicans, Democrats
and independents.
</P>
<P>
   In the last week, hundreds of calls and thousands of e-mail
messages have poured into Leach's offices in Washington, Davenport,
Iowa City and Cedar Rapids _ 10 times the usual volume. A little
less than two-thirds have favored impeachment. Bill Tate, Leach's
longtime administrative assistant, said ``the tenor of the calls is
increasingly angry about his not making a public pronouncement.''
</P>
<P>
   As the judiciary committee debated and then voted on the
articles of impeachment, the phone rang insistently in Leach's
Cedar Rapids office.
</P>
<P>
   ``To impeach the president over this thing,'' sputtered a
78-year-old man from Marion who said he was disgusted with the
impeachment process. ``I've been a Republican most of my life and I
can damn well assure you that a lot of people won't vote Republican
again.''
</P>
<P>
   A 54-year-old woman named Jan from Anamosa was practically
writhing with anger. ``I cannot believe as an American citizen the
perversion and the twisting of the Democrats,'' she said. ``It just
sickens me. I have sat here and I have wept.''
</P>
<P>
   And then there was this handwritten missive received over the
fax machine: ``Mr. Leach. Please do not vote to impeach, I don't
want it and the country does not want it! Take Mr. C to court after
his term!''
</P>
<P>
   The writer, possibly concerned about sounding overbearing,
finished off with a smiley face and a wish for ``Happy Holidays''
underlined with a squiggle.
</P>
<P>
   Leach's press secretary, Douglas Wagner, who was fielding many
of the calls while the congressman was in Washington, said that as
the week wore on the ratio of people supporting or rejecting
impeachment did not seem to change. But he said that the calls were
becoming more urgent each day and that he had never before heard
constituents respond with ``this kind of consistent intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, Wagner said, there would be a flurry of calls when
something dramatic was happening _ a member of the committee
delivering a particularly sharp-tongued speech, the president
issuing his Rose Garden apology, an article of impeachment being
approved. And any time one of the local newspapers wrote a story
about Leach's decision, as the Cedar Rapids Gazette did on Friday,
the phones would ring even more.
</P>
<P>
   Leach, who has represented eastern Iowa for 22 years, has a
reputation for being careful, deliberative and not easy to
pigeonhole. As the ranking Republican on the House Banking
Committee, Leach led hearings on Whitewater. But he also voted
against Newt Gingrich for speaker of the House in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure there is no love lost between him and the White
House, perhaps unlike some of the other `swing' Republicans,'' said
Bruce Nesmith, a political science professor at Coe College in
Cedar Rapids. ``On the other hand, he has had his problems with the
Republican leaders in the House.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Leach has issued only a two-sentence statement calling
the impeachment matter ``a trauma for the country that demands
enormous caution.''
</P>
<P>
   Will all the calls from impassioned voters make a difference?
Wagner was circumspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's people that would say the representative is there to
vote the people's will and there are those who say the
representative is there to vote his conscience,'' he said. ``As a
practical matter it is impossible to take polls on everything, so I
guess he feels more of the latter.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Leach's staff is paying attention, struck that so many in
and around this city of about 110,000 have such strong opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Riley, a Lutheran minister who was sitting near the
Christmas gingerbread house in the Lindale shopping mall here, said
he did not expect that the Senate would ultimately find the
president guilty of impeachable offenses. But he wanted Leach to
support impeachment anyway, to scare Clinton and show him that
``he's not a sovereign king, but he's subject to the
Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   Harold Hutchins, a retired electric company supervisor who
favors censure, not impeachment, said Leach should have tried early
on to prevent the explicit sexual revelations of Clinton's affair
with Monica Lewinsky from reaching the eyes and ears of ordinary
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a little disappointed as a Midwesterner,'' Hutchins said,
``that Leach did not come out and say, `Hey, we don't need all
this. It's too much detail.' ''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the full House returning for a vote on
impeachment this week, President Clinton on Sunday rebuffed
Republican calls for him to admit to lying under oath and said
flatly that he had not committed perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Looking grim, he deflected suggestions that he should step down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no intention of resigning,'' he said. ``It's never
crossed my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Unable to escape the constitutional crisis engulfing his
presidency, the president fielded questions about his fate side by
side with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in Jerusalem, where he
had flown to try to revive the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Charged with four counts of impeachment for perjury, obstruction
of justice and abuse of power, Clinton said he would not admit to
lying under oath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not admit to doing something that I am quite sure I
did not do,'' he said. And he took recourse in public opinion polls
to argue that he should be censured, saying ``apparently some
three-quarters of the American people think it's the right thing to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, leading Republicans said his remarks had further
eroded his support and several said he should save the nation from
an impeachment trial by resigning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a way of going out with honor,'' said Rep. Henry
Hyde, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, who appeared
on both ABC's ``This Week'' and CBS' ``Face the Nation'' news
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would save the country, if he cares about the
country, and I know he does, I think it would save the country a
lot of turmoil and tumult,'' Hyde said. Rep. Tom DeLay, the House
majority whip from Texas, echoed Hyde's appeal for Clinton's
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   The two men spoke a day after the Judiciary Committee ended its
nine-week inquiry by approving, on a party line vote, its fourth
article of impeachment charging Clinton with abuse of power and
calling for him to be removed from the presidency and never allowed
to hold another office.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde showed impatience with calls for Republicans to heed the
message of the mid-term elections and the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be naive and stupid and probably both, but I just
think a thermometer is not a terribly useful thing on matters of
conscience and matters of principle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 74-year old Illinois Republican said, ``Look, if Jesus
Christ had taken a poll, he would never have preached the gospel.
</P>
<P>
   The House is to formally receive the four articles of
impeachment and an accompanying report from the Judiciary Committee
Wednesday morning. The full House is to begin debating Clinton's
impeachment and removal from office Thursday at 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   It will be only the second time in history that the full House
has been called on to consider the impeachment of a president.
Richard Nixon resigned the presidency in the Watergate scandal 24
years ago before a House vote. Andrew Johnson was impeached and
saved from removal from office by one vote after a Senate trial in
1868.
</P>
<P>
   Both DeLay and John Podesta, the White House chief of staff,
called the situation in the House too close to call, with about two
dozen moderate Republicans able to tilt the vote either way.
</P>
<P>
   But the trend appeared to be moving against Clinton. A number of
the Republicans who could make the difference said that the
president had hurt his case with his insistence on Sunday that he
had not perjured himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two simple words, `I lied,' would have gone a long way,'' said
Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., who is accompanying Clinton on his trip to
the Mideast. He spoke on CNN's ``Late Edition.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican, Rep. Bob Ney of Ohio, said, ``I think the
president hurt himself very clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks, however, remained consistent with his defense
before a grand jury last Aug. 17, when he denied that he had lied
in a deposition in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case by saying
he had not had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Underpinning that August testimony was the idea _ repeated by
Clinton's lawyers in their summations before the House Judiciary
Committee last week _ that the president was intentionally trying
to mislead his inquisitors in the Jones case while staying on the
right side of the legal line between not helping his accusers and
perjuring himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, was the testimony in the deposition difficult and
ambiguous  &QL; 
and unhelpful?'' Clinton said on Sunday. ``Yes, it was. That's
exactly what I said in the grand jury testimony, myself.''
</P>
<P>
   While that argument might well serve as a defense in an actual
perjury prosecution, it has infuriated Republicans who charge that
the president has undermined the rule of law. Rep. Scott Klug,
R-Wis., said, on Sunday, ``It's the same thing we've heard: I
didn't, I didn't, I didn't. And I think everybody realizes he
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Democrats have been left arguing that the president
deceived the nation, but his lies did not rise to the
constitutional threshold for removing him from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lied to the American people,'' Rep. Dick Gephardt, the
House minority leader, said on the NBC news program ``Meet the
Press.'' ``As bad as that is, I do not think it rises to the level
of impeachment. If he committed a crime of lying under oath _ and
there's a debate by legal scholars on whether or not he actually
perjured himself _ it should be decided in a court of law, in a
criminal proceeding and that will happen after he leaves office if
he is indicted.''
</P>
<P>
   Although House leaders have yet to negotiate how many hours will
be set aside for the debate on impeachment, senior Republicans said
the deliberations could spill over into Friday. The House will take
separate votes on each of the four articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Both Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary, and Gephardt
appealed again on Sunday for Rep. Robert Livingston, the incoming
House speaker, to reverse himself and allow a vote on censure to
come to the floor, as well as the impeachment charges. On Saturday
night, Livingston said censure would violate the separation of
powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot believe,'' Gephardt said, ``I don't want to bring
myself to believe that the leadership in the House is not going to
allow the members to vote their very deeply held feelings on this
very important issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Democrat said Democrats would use a procedural
tactic to try to force the issue, if all else fails. If censure is
not allowed to the floor, more Republicans and even a few more
Democrats than expected might opt for impeachment because they
would have no other way to show their disapproval of the
president's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   If any article of impeachment is approved, Clinton's fate moves
to the Senate for a trial. Unwilling to influence events, the
Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate have said they will
remain silent until after the House acts. A two-thirds vote in the
Senate would be needed to remove Clinton from office.

</P>
<P>
   Both political parties plan caucuses of House members on
Wednesday where members of the Judiciary Committee are likely to
brief members of the lameduck 105th Congress on the legal issues.
</P>
<P>
   The battle for votes is expected to become fierce across the
next few days, although both the White House and Republican leaders
tried to portray themselves on Sunday as not actually lobbying,
while accusing the other side of pressuring House members. And in a
sign of how bitter the fight has become, DeLay on Sunday raised
questions about Clinton's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm suggesting the president of the United States cannot be
believed and I think it's reflective in his foreign policy,'' the
Texas Republican said. ``Saddam Hussein knows it and that's why he
jerks his chain all the time.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright shot back on CNN that any
suggestion Clinton would try to manipulate foreign policy crises
for personal reasons ''undercuts our national security.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has never been well liked in Congress and that fact
seems to becoming back to haunt him now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm prejudiced against him,'' Rep. W.J. Tauzin, R-La., who is
a possible swing vote, admitted on Sunday. ``You see he's lied to
me personally on a very serious matter.'' He was referring to
negotiations over an energy tax in the 1993 budget deal.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans also seem to still be harboring deep feeling
about the Watergate scandal of a quarter of a century ago.
Livingston on Saturday told reporters that Nixon ``faced
impeachment because he covered up a burglary committed by others.''
He asked ``So why was impeachment the remedy for Nixon and not for
Clinton?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would not be calling members of Congress
personally unless they sent word that they wanted to talk to him.
Mostly, the White House and Democrats were trying to make an appeal
to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to make a special plea to the American people to
get engaged and be involved,'' the White House special counsel,
Gregory Craig, said Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Organized labor was also looking at some way to mount an appeal
for censure. Local unions across the country have set up phone
banks in recent days to lobby Republican lawmakers against
impeachment, but internationals and the AFL-CIO have avoided taking
a public position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to make this a labor versus far-right fight,''
Peggy Taylor, the AFL-CIO's director of legislation, said in an
interview. ``But after watching the hearings, and seeing how
partisan this has become, it seems more and more outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   And members of Congress were finding their constituents weighing
in. Rep. Jim Ramstad, R-Minn., said he is undecided but leaning
toward voting for impeachment on the first article, which charges
the president with lying to a federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, as Ramstad rang a bell to raise money for the
Salvation Army in front of a supermarket, he said people came up to
him to argue for and against impeachment. ``I was barraged,''
Ramstad said. ``Everyone has strong feelings.''

EMBASSIES ALERT AMERICANS IN PERSIAN GULF TO THREAT OF ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUWAIT _ U.S. embassies in four Persian Gulf countries warned
Sunday of a ``strong possibility'' that terrorists might attempt an
attack against one or more U.S. targets in the region in the next
month.
</P>
<P>
   The warning, issued to Americans in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia,
Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, was unusually precise, and it
was backed up by a show of particular concern. In Bahrain,
headquarters of the U.S. Fifth Fleet, the embassy said that about
1,000 U.S. military personnel have been put under curfew and told
not to gather in large numbers at public places.
</P>
<P>
   The statements called on Americans in the region to ``remain
alert to any suspicious activity and take precautionary steps to
reduce the profile and vulnerability of any United States
facilities.''
</P>
<P>
   They said the U.S. government had information indicating ``a
strong possibility that terrorist elements are planning an attack
against U.S. targets in the gulf, possibly in the next 30 days.''
</P>
<P>
   At least 45,000 Americans, including about 9,000 soldiers,
sailors and airmen, live in the four Persian Gulf countries, and
their security has been a major concern of U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   The last attacks in the region, in Saudi Arabia in 1995 and
1996, killed 24 Americans, including 19 servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   In October, all U.S. missions in Saudi Arabia closed for four
days to review security after receiving information that the U.S.
Embassy in Riyadh was under threat of a terrorist attack. That move
followed the Aug. 7 bombings of U.S. embassies in Nairobi, Kenya,
and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, in which 224 people were killed and
5,000 injured.
</P>
<P>
   The latest U.S. warnings do not say who might carry out a new
terrorist attack. But the warning in Saudi Arabia does reiterate
standing U.S. concerns over the threats that the Saudi dissident
Osama bin Laden has issued against Americans in the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden has been indicted for alleged involvement in a number
of attacks on Americans, including the bombings of the U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. His operations in Afghanistan were
the targets of a U.S. cruise-missile attack, following the embassy
attacks, that U.S. officials cast as a pre-emptive raid.
</P>
<P>
   In all four of the countries in which the warnings were issued
Sunday, U.S. military forces maintain a significant presence.
</P>
<P>
   About 5,000 airmen are based in Saudi Arabia, most of them in
the remote desert sites to which U.S. military operations in the
kingdom were transferred after the 1996 bombing in Dhahran.
</P>
<P>
   About 3,000 U.S. servicemen are in Kuwait, most of them also at
remote sites.
</P>
<P>
   Only a handful of Navy personnel are based in the United Arab
Emirates, but its port of Jebel Ali is a frequent stopping point
for crews and Navy vessels that patrol the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   Among the four gulf countries, it has been in Bahrain that U.S.
servicemen have been most visible, but curfews like the one imposed
Sunday have also been ordered in the past.

   Following are excerpts from weekend editorials published in
newspapers across the United States on the impeachment proceedings
against President Clinton:
</P>
<P>
   MANCHESTER (N.H.) UNION LEADER AND SUNDAY NEWS, Dec. 13
</P>
<P>
   Many comparisons are being made in these historic days between
the attempted impeachments of Richard M. Nixon and William
Jefferson Clinton. There is one clear difference, at least to date.
</P>
<P>
   For all his misdeeds, Nixon finally had the great good sense and
love of country to resign his office. ...
</P>
<P>
   Clinton partisans say that an impeachment would be bad for the
country. The trial, conducted in the U.S. Senate, would tie up the
country for months or even a year. Financial markets may be
disrupted. The Chief Justice will be tied up with the trial,
delaying the Supreme Court's work. ...
</P>
<P>
   Fine, we say. The answer is simple, and has always been
available to the President. He can resign. He can for once do the
honorable thing and perhaps help repair the dishonor his actions
have done to the White House and to the office and to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   If he will not do so, if he continues to delay, delay, delay and
use every political and legal trick in the book, then the U.S.
House of Representatives must and should do the honorable thing and
vote his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   To do anything less _ to plea-bargain _ only compounds the wrong
that Mr. Clinton has done to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   LINCOLN (NEB.) JOURNAL STAR, Dec. 13
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton should have resigned months ago, sparing the
country the tortuous and unavoidable impeachment investigation into
his misconduct. ...
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the question. What is the next best option?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is that he should be censured. ...
</P>
<P>
   Where Clinton crossed the line, where he jeopardized his
presidency, was when he lied about it under oath. ...
</P>
<P>
   That action is inexcusable for the chief executive of the United
States, sworn to uphold the law.
</P>
<P>
   There must be official action governmental sanction that holds
him accountable.
</P>
<P>
   That action, however, does not have to be impeachment. It does
not have to be, and should not be, removal from office. ...
</P>
<P>
   A better end to this sorry affair is for the House of
Representatives to quickly, sternly censure Clinton, preferably
with some sort of penalty such as a fine, and retain the
possibility that he face criminal charges once he leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS REVIEW JOURNAL, Dec. 13
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton never admitted anything till he was cornered with
the incontrovertible evidence of phone logs, visitor logs, tape
recordings, and DNA evidence from a stained dress. Even then, his
confessions have remained laughably partial. ...
</P>
<P>
   At the last moment, literally minutes before the slowly grinding
gears of the majestic and fearful process were due to produce an
impeachment referral from the House Judiciary Committee on Friday
afternoon, Mr. Clinton sent word that the TV cameras should be
prepared for a major presidential announcement. ...
</P>
<P>
   His remorse? In a carefully crafted use of the passive voice, he
expressed remorse not for what he himself has caused, but `for what
our country is going through' perpetrators unknown, presumably. And
the `consequences' he is `prepared to accept?' Even as the House
committee voted to recommend impeachment, the president said he
would be willing to ``accept their censure.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the president expresses no convincing concern for
the primacy of the rule of law, for the credibility of his office,
his administration, or the nation he leads. Instead he whimpers
only about himself, his feelings, and how much or little he may
have to do to make this problem go away. If it's not too late,
perhaps one more article should be added to that referral. The
Constitution allows the office of the presidency to be occupied
only by an adult.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT FREE PRESS, Dec. 12
</P>
<P>
   Looking pale and nearly pathetic, President Bill Clinton threw
himself on the mercy of the Congress Friday, in effect asking for a
public scolding instead of an impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   A heavy censure is what Clinton deserves, and what the American
people seem to want. The best outcome for this mess is for the
House to vote down impeachment next week, spare the nation any more
months of sex and semantics, then give the president a good
thrashing on prime-time TV. ...
</P>
<P>
   We believe the result should be a well-considered decision
against impeachment, followed by a strongly worded and publicly
delivered condemnation of the president's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   BERKSHIRE EAGLE, Pittsfield, Mass., Dec. 13
</P>
<P>
   Vote to impeach or not to impeach? Have these Republicans
learned nothing at all from recent history?
</P>
<P>
   The same Americans that voted them into embarrassment in the
last election want no part of an impeachment of President Bill
Clinton. Polls clearly indicate that if he is to be locked up,
Americans prefer he get locked up after his final two years in
office.
</P>
<P>
   Even if House members rush to cast an impeachment vote before
the current session runs out, there probably aren't enough votes to
cover the two-third majority necessary to pass impeachment
articles. Even if there would be, there certainly aren't the 66
votes such a measure needs to pass in the Senate. ...
</P>
<P>
   We know what Clinton did with Monica Lewinsky in the Oval
Office. We know the moral thing to do would have been resignation.
We know he's not going to do that.
</P>
<P>
   His actions were immoral, but they weren't illegal. If he
perjured his testimony, it's going to be very difficult to prove.
What we're witnessing now in Washington is completely unnecessary.
And so it goes.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to move on.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   WICHITA (KAN.) EAGLE, Dec. 13
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. House of Representatives this week should vote to
impeach President Bill Clinton and move the matter to the U.S.
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   It is with the deepest regret that The Eagle's editorial board
makes that recommendation. The decision has been the most difficult
in the memory of any of the board's members.
</P>
<P>
   This recommendation does not mean that Mr. Clinton should be
removed from office for his reprehensible behavior in the Monica
Lewinsky affair. That is a matter to be decided by the Senate in a
sober and serious atmosphere ... .
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee approved four articles of
impeachment. The two directly involving perjury are the most
serious; the president surely must be held accountable for his
testimony in the Paula Jones lawsuit and to Kenneth Starr's grand
jury.
</P>
<P>
   Though censure and censure-plus-a-big-fine have been discussed,
either would be relatively meaningless _ at this point. At this
point, impeachment by the House is the surest form of real censure,
even though the process has been badly contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom line is the painful judgment that America would
best be served by the constitutional process of impeachment by the
House and judgment by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   BIRMINGHAM (ALA.) POST-HERALD, Dec. 13
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment is a way of saying loudly and unmistakably that the
president's actions constituted a betrayal of his trust. But all
betrayals are not created equal, and the president's, while utterly
dismaying, is not so horrendous that it absolutely must be allowed
to cause this nation more grief than it already has. ...
</P>
<P>
   If his acts had cost Clinton credibility to the extent that he
could no longer govern, the alternative to impeachment a vote of
censure would make no sense. The public, however, continues to
support the president in large numbers, meaning that the Senate
will not convict and that a conviction, if it did happen, would
cause havoc. The proceedings should end with a defeat in the House
of the articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   THE WASHINGTON POST, Dec. 13
</P>
<P>
   The House Judiciary Committee has now completed its task, and it
has failed miserably. It has approved four articles of impeachment,
of which two are ill-defined and two are unsubstantiated. It also
has arrogantly voted not to report a censure resolution, thereby
seeking to deprive the full House of any alternative to
impeachment. The House Republican leadership should remedy this
situation by somehow ensuring that the full House gets to vote on
the sensible alternative of a strongly worded censure resolution.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that President Clinton committed grave
offenses and aggravated them by refusing to acknowledge either the
offenses themselves or their seriousness. The two perjury articles
reported by the committee are both, in our judgment, factually
accurate. But in this case, impeachment is an overly broad
response. ...
</P>
<P>
   The obstruction of justice article remains factually unproven.
While the charges are serious and the evidence supplied by
independent counsel Kenneth Starr raises questions that cannot be
dismissed, the committee has not done the required investigation to
substantiate these allegations. In the face of this failure, the
article is irresponsible.
</P>
<P>
   The abuse of power article, likewise, is a mistake. ...
</P>
<P>
   Failing to send the Democratic censure resolution to the floor
is the committee's final, crucial mistake. Committee Republicans
spent a good deal of time yesterday deriding censure as
unconstitutional. But nothing in the Constitution prevents a
censure resolution, as long as Congress does not seek to impose a
fine or other material punishment on the president. ... That
censure marks a viable third way may be why some Republicans wish
to avoid it. The new House leadership should allow members to vote
on a reasonable alternative to impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   THE PHILADELPHIA INQUIRER
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's sworn lies and maddening denial have taken
him _ and the nation _ to the brink of an impeachment that most
Americans sensibly oppose. By expressing contrition but no legal
admissions, Mr. Clinton made it easier for the polarized House
Judiciary Committee to recommend impeachment to the full House. ...
</P>
<P>
   The crux of the full House's decision has to be whether the
President's behavior meets the grave constitutional standard of
`high crimes and misdemeanors.' As badly as he's behaved, it does
not. ...
</P>
<P>
   The extreme punishment of removal from office is
disproportionate to Mr. Clinton's misconduct. Instead, both houses
of Congress ought to pass a searing condemnation of Mr. Clinton's
disregard for the law. This joint resolution would require the
President's signature, which he indicated Friday he would consider.
...
</P>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE (N.C.) OBSERVER
</P>
<P>
   A court may one day decide whether Bill Clinton committed
perjury, but it's clear that he lied many times _ in a civil
deposition, in grand jury testimony, to his cabinet, his family and
his nation. He lied and lied and lied in an attempt to conceal his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky. He could face criminal charges
for his offenses after he leaves office. He could lose his law
license.
</P>
<P>
   What should Congress do about it? ...
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution gives Congress one power regarding the chief
executive's conduct: to determine whether a president committed
treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors'' that
justify removal from office. ...
</P>
<P>
   If the public approves of Mr. Clinton's job performance, if
Congress is working with him, if world leaders rely on him, it's
difficult to conclude that the nation's well-being requires his
removal from office. ...
</P>
<P>
   But unusual times may demand unusual measures. A strong
resolution of censure is not as bad as the likely alternative, a
highly partisan effort to impeach the president. Rep. Bob
Livingston, the next House speaker, should tell his fellow
Republicans that and lead them in crafting such a resolution. It's
time for responsible Republican leaders to lead.
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS POST-DISPATCH, Dec. 13
</P>
<P>
   Henry Hyde says the House Judiciary Committee had to vote for
impeachment on Friday to uphold the rule of law. But the
committee's partisan vote to impeach the president for lying about
sex does more to trivialize the law than to vindicate it.
</P>
<P>
   It is simply wrong to say that the only way for Congress to
stand up for the rule of law is to employ the 100-megaton bomb the
Constitution reserves for presidential abuse of office.
</P>
<P>
   As most of the country has been saying for months, there is
another way _ to pass a resolution of censure that condemns the
president for lying to the nation and misleading the courts.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   COLUMBUS DISPATCH, Dec. 13
</P>
<P>
   Only rarely does a U.S. Congress vote on anything as momentous
as the impeachment of a president, but later this week, the 435
members of the House will do just that. ...
</P>
<P>
   The Dispatch believes that at the very least, President Clinton
is guilty of perjury, and that his position does not excuse him
from obedience to the law or responsibility for violating it.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the central issues are nearly lost in the thick
smog of angry, partisan charges and countercharges that now
envelops the impeachment inquiry and that has come to sicken the
American public. ...
</P>
<P>
   Now is the time to clear away this cloud of rancor and
accusation and address the real issue.
</P>
<P>
   House members will find no dishonor in holding that breaking an
oath of office is wrong, that lying under oath is wrong and that
lying to the American people is wrong.
</P>
<P>
   They will show no cowardice in branding as unacceptable the
cynical perversion of the law by the chief law-enforcement officer
of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   To say that such a person has soiled the honorable office to
which he was elected by the people is not vengeful or vindictive.
</P>
<P>
   Let each representative put aside partisanship, anger, insults
and threats and cast a vote that best serves the Constitution and
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS STAR TRIBUNE, Dec. 12
</P>
<P>
   In pressing ahead with articles of impeachment against President
Clinton, the House Judiciary Committee's majority doggedly flouts
historical precedent, the wisdom of constitutional scholars and the
demonstrated will of the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   Any reading of the Constitution's historical context shows that
Article II, Section 4 was crafted to protect this new democracy
from an unjust use of power _ that is, from tyranny. Its
stipulation of `Treason, Bribery, or other high Crimes and
Misdemeanors' as a justification for impeachment denotes weighty
offenses _ the level of misconduct that faced Watergate's grave,
earnest Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   When citizens watch that somber panel's 1998 counterpart in
action, they see not gravity but anger. They don't see, as
Americans did in 1974, a bipartisan awakening to the horrible truth
of a president's offenses against democracy. Instead they see a
scornful majority counsel forced to make the worst possible
inferences to hoist a sex scandal and its aftermath to the level of
constitutional crisis. Call it Impeachment Lite, a pseudo-sorrowful
ritual of impeachment as punishment. ...
</P>
<P>
   What the House may do is unthinkable. It is unthinkable for a
majority party to punish a popular president for private behavior,
against the demonstrated will of the electorate _ using a mechanism
designed to protect the republic from abuse against the state.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's behavior with Monica Lewinsky was improper and
reckless. He handled its consequences badly. He deserves the stern
vote of rebuke or censure that he told Americans Friday he is ready
to accept.
</P>
<P>
   But those who vote to impeach will deserve the voters' wrath.
For in using a protective measure as a punishment, they are
misusing the Constitution they're bound to honor.
</P>
<P>
   ALBANY (N.Y.) TIMES UNION, Dec. 13
</P>
<P>
   The case for impeaching President Clinton has now been drawn in
stark contrast by chief counsels for the minority Democrats and
majority Republicans _ so stark, in fact, that the House Judiciary
Committee's votes stand out as a partisan exercise. If the full
House wants to serve the national interest instead of partisanship,
then lawmakers on both sides of the aisle will have to act more
objectively.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Clinton made the best case for mercy in his brief address
Friday afternoon. That followed the lucid and superbly summation by
the Democrats' chief counsel, Abbe Lowell, on Thursday. The case
against Mr. Clinton was made, derisively and sarcastically, by
chief majority counsel David Schippers. ...
</P>
<P>
   While much was made by way of comparison to Watergate, Mr.
Lowell made clear that the Clinton's case in no way resembles, or
approaches Mr. Nixon's abuse of power. To the contrary, this
inquiry has been spun out of the Paula Jones sexual harassment
lawsuit and pertains to conduct long before Mr. Clinton came to
Washington. ...
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Mr. Schippers' summation oozed with sarcasm and
speculation. So what if Ms. Lewinsky denied, under oath, that she
was ever told to lie or that she would be given a job in exchange
for her silence. She knew what was expected of her, Mr. Schippers
intoned. And she did get a job. ...
</P>
<P>
   Any fair reading of the facts, and the testimony, requires
evidence of wrongdoing, not an assumption that it occurred.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it is Mr. Clinton's Republican foes who argue so
strongly that perjury is perjury, and that Mr. Clinton's defenders
cannot hide behind the claim that lies about sex are not as serious
as other misstatements. But that raises the obvious question: If
the law is to be considered literally, and without any room for
nuance, then why isn't it just as necessary to weigh the evidence
literally? ... The facts, and just the facts. In no way do they add
up to impeachable offenses.

HOW DO YOU MEASURE SOMEONE'S WORTH?

<P>
   &LR; Kevin Brown isn't among the 100 greatest players in baseball
history.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Clemens is.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Maddux is.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza, Bernie Williams, Gary Sheffield, Albert Belle or Mo
Vaughn? Nope.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey Jr., Barry Bonds, Rickey Henderson, Tony Gwynn, Mark
McGwire, Wade Boggs and Cal Ripken? You betcha.
</P>
<P>
   That is, according to ``The Sporting News Selects Baseball's 100
Greatest Players: A Celebration of the 20th Century's Best'' (by
Ron Smith, $29.95, 224 pgs).
</P>
<P>
   Of those players just listed as not worthy of legend, each has a
contract worth at least $50 million _ the highest in the land,
topped by Brown's new $105 million deal. Of those who already have
a place in history, only Maddux ($57.5 million) is in the
neighborhood. Bonds is almost there.
</P>
<P>
   So it's all a matter of how you measure a great player, right?
</P>
<P>
   This meticulous list is loaded more with those whose careers _
and lives _ have already passed. Maybe they were the highest paid
in their day, but they'll never see the millions given to those
considered the greatest in this day.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge is to assign a number value to a player, as TSN's
editors have done. But for a game like baseball, this book works
more as a celebration than a boastful try-to-top-this compilation.
In fact, living members of the Top 100 were asked to submit their
10 greatest players, and those lists are included for comparison.
</P>
<P>
   The book might start a million arguments. But it's worth it.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By declaring his intentions to fight censure and to
vote to impeach President Clinton, Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La.,
has taken his most significant step so far as the incoming speaker
of the House and has perhaps defined himself for the duration of
his tenure _ even though he has yet to be sworn in.
</P>
<P>
   His comments, made after the Judiciary Committee voted in favor
of the last of four articles of impeachment and against censure,
mark him as the fierce institutionalist that many know him to be.
But they also reveal him as a fierce conservative and a fierce
Republican partisan, which Livingston has been at some pains to
tamp down as he assumes the mantle of speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, a former criminal prosecutor, said in an interview
Saturday night that he would vote for impeachment when the full
House takes up the matter on Thursday and expressed an apparently
pent-up belief that Clinton's behavior was on a par with, if not
worse than, President Nixon's during Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he said, ``a pretty concrete case'' of perjury had been
built against Clinton, a charge not brought against Nixon. ``So why
was impeachment the remedy for Nixon and not for Clinton?'' he
asked, reflecting the eye-for-an-eye vengeance that now drives much
of politics in Washington and that has been an unspoken force in
the conservative thrust against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he would mount a strong campaign in the House
against a Democratic move to censure Clinton instead of impeaching
him. Such a campaign is technically about House rules but is really
a party's call to arms. This will be Livingston's first test of
power, of whether he can control his diverse Republican flock on a
matter of personal and party loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Livingston laid down a marker, saying that a
move for censure in the House would be unconstitutional (although
scholars disagree on this) and that he would perceive any
Republican vote for censure as an affront to the speakership and a
betrayal of the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``An attack on the rules is an attack on the chair is an attack
on the majority,'' he said, his clearest expression to date that
the procedural is political.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few days, he will be making that argument to his
colleagues, transforming himself virtually overnight from a
seemingly impartial observer of the impeachment drama to one of its
central players.
</P>
<P>
   It has been easy to forget that Livingston, 55, holds deeply
ingrained conservative views. His home district in suburban New
Orleans twice rejected Bill Clinton for president, preferring Bob
Dole in 1996 and George Bush in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Since he publicly declared on Nov. 6 that he was going after
Newt Gingrich's job and prompted Gingrich to resign, Livingston has
deliberately projected a low-key non-Newtness, preferring to stay
in the background, keep his head down and tweak the nuts and bolts
of his transition machinery rather than grab a national platform.
</P>
<P>
   Friends have various explanations for why he seemed to go
underground. They say he was haunted by the picture of himself as
intemperate and intransigent during the 1995 government shutdown,
when he thundered on the House floor: ``We will never, never, never
give in! We will stay here until doomsday!''
</P>
<P>
   They say he did not want to begin his speakership _ he is to be
sworn in Jan. 6, with a slim six-vote majority _ by either
disappointing conservatives who were calling for Clinton's head or
alienating moderates who saw no percentage in impeachment. And,
they say, as a former committee chairman, his natural inclination
was to defer to Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In an important signal to his party, Livingston appointed a
conservative and a moderate _ Reps. Ron Packard of California and
Marge Roukema of New Jersey, respectively _ to chair his transition
team. And he has picked another conservative-moderate duo, Reps.
Steve Largent of Oklahoma and Jennifer Dunn of Washington, to
deliver the Republican response to Clinton's State of the Union
message in January.
</P>
<P>
   But he seemed so conciliatory, and so removed from impeachment,
that some in his party were getting worried. Rep. Tom DeLay,
R-Texas, No. 3 in the Republican House leadership, was rapidly
filling the power vacuum. Hyde was getting bloodied. Some were
starting to whisper that Livingston was not up to the job of
speaker.
</P>
<P>
   With the Judiciary Committee's vote and his public comments,
Livingston has now assumed responsibility for the direction of
impeachment in the House. It was clear that he has been
coordinating some strategy with Hyde and DeLay, although he has
refrained from joining their call for Clinton to resign. But he
shares DeLay's view of impeachment, saying that it is ``merely
bringing a charge against the president'' and that it is up to the
Senate to decide what to do about it.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are making clear that they perceive Livingston's
opposition to censure as a grave mistake that could undo the
conciliatory gestures he has made so far. In a letter to Livingston
seeking a vote on censure, Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the
Democratic leader, wrote: ``Your decision regarding these
proceedings will decide whether or not history will mark our
actions as a purely political exercise or a high-minded debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Delahunt, D-Mass., a member of the Judiciary
Committee, who is also pressing for a vote on censure, took issue
with Livingston's rather passive characterization of his task.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't simply just sending over some charges,'' Delahunt
said. ``This is about removing the president. This is the first
step in launching a nuclear missile.''

ORACLE JOINS SUN IN PLAN TO CHALLENGE WINDOWS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Microsoft's archrivals, Sun Microsystems and
Oracle, plan to announce a joint effort on Monday to make corporate
computer users less reliant on Microsoft's Windows software.
</P>
<P>
   Sun and Oracle intend to create network server computers that
users of desktop machines can draw upon for many of their basic
computing activities, reducing the need for a full-blown desktop
operating system like Windows. The move is also meant to slow the
rapid rise of Microsoft's office-network version of Windows, called
Windows NT.
</P>
<P>
   It is a strategy that Sun and Oracle have pursued in the past,
so far without success.
</P>
<P>
   The new plan is based on a cross-licensing agreement the two
companies signed earlier this month. The agreement gave Oracle the
ability to use a portion of Sun's Solaris operating system software
to create simple server computers that would be designed to run
Internet and office data base applications. The agreement also
permits Sun to add Oracle's data base software to the Solaris
operating system, which competes with Windows NT from Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   The plan conforms to a strategy that has been outlined by
Oracle's chairman, Lawrence Ellison, in his effort to fight Windows
and Windows NT by doing away with the need for an operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Last month Ellison announced that Oracle planned to introduce a
new version of its Oracle 8 data base program code-named Raw Iron,
which he said would be sold by makers of PC server computers,
including Compaq, Sun Microsystems, Hewlett-Packard and Dell
Computer as an adaptation that would, in effect, render the
operating system invisible to the user.
</P>
<P>
   The new strategy is a refinement of Ellison's attempt in years
past to persuade corporate computer managers to simplify their
networks by replacing the personal computer on a worker's desktop
with a simpler terminal called a network computer.
</P>
<P>
   That effort had the support of Novell, Sun, Netscape and a
number of other Microsoft rivals. The companies began plotting an
alternative to the personal computer in 1995, based on the idea of
inexpensive desktop computers that would download software via
corporate networks. But the approach has been slow to develop, in
part because of the sharply falling cost of personal computers and
in part because computer makers have been slow to offer
commercially viable systems.
</P>
<P>
   But Ellison and his allies have not given up. In its most recent
iteration, the network computing idea now calls for almost all
computing tasks to be centralized on servers, so that users' own
computers will do little more than act as monitors for the server
computers.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems, for example, has begun developing an
experimental version called Newt, which the company describes as an
``ultra-thin client.''
</P>
<P>
   The device would have the advantage of reducing the costs of
operating corporate computers while centralizing and simplifying
their management. But it requires a relatively bureaucratic style
of computing that takes away a great deal of the freedom to which
users have become accustomed as they use PC's.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft executives deride the Sun-Oracle approach as a style
of computing that went out of fashion with the mainframes and
minicomputers that held sway in the 1960s and 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   But the criticism has not deterred Ellison, who is promising a
vast drop in the complexity and cost of computing for small
businesses.

FEDERAL COURT ASKED TO RULE ON YEAR 2000 INSURANCE DISPUTE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)  (ms) 
 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the first time, a federal court has been asked to rule on
one of the most frequently asked year 2000 liability questions:
Does normal business liability insurance cover a software company
that is sued for selling products that cannot cope with the year
2000?
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati Insurance Co., based in Fairfield, Ohio, has
asked the U.S. District Court in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, to rule that
the policy it sold to Source Data Systems does not require it to
defend Source Data from lawsuits contending that its products
cannot recognize dates after Jan. 1, 2000, or to reimburse Source
Data for the the cost of fixing or replacing defective products.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati Insurance filed its request for the ruling Dec. 4.
The coverage dispute grew out of a lawsuit filed in July in a
Kentucky state court against Source Data, of Cedar Rapids, by the
Pineville Community Hospital Association, a Kentucky hospital
group.
</P>
<P>
   Pineville is seeking $1.25 million to cover the cost of
replacing Source Data hospital management software installed in
1996. Five months after the system went on line, according to the
complaint, Pineville learned that the system could not handle the
transition to the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Year 2000 legal experts say the issue of insurance coverage for
software companies is a vital one. If software users with year 2000
problems cannot reach into the pockets of the software companies'
insurers for compensation, many software companies could be
bankrupted _ and many customers out of luck _ if such problems are
widespread.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is likely to be an avalanche of these types of cases,''
said Walter Andrews, a Washington lawyer who is not involved in the
Source Data case but represents numerous insurers.
</P>
<P>
   Source Data, which is now owned by Keane Inc., has denied that
its contract with Pineville to install the system guaranteed year
2000 capability. But, it says, if it is liable, the insurance
policy ought to cover its costs.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati Insurance says its general liability policies will
cover some year 2000 problems. But, the insurer argues, the cost of
curing foreseen defects before there is any damage to individuals
or property is clearly outside the policies' scope.

THE LITTLE WHITE BALL IS SUDDENLY COLORBLIND 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SUZANNE DALEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOWETO, South Africa _ The golf course at Soweto's Country Club
has come a long way since the days when players putted on greens
that were just smoothed-over dirt and the holes were buried tin
cans.
</P>
<P>
   The course _ like Soweto itself _ is coming up in the world. It
has a new wrought-iron fence, three specialized mowing machines, a
sprinkler system and a campaign to remake its image, which has
managed to attract dozens of white players, at least for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Next year the club plans to more than triple its annual fees _
though at less than $100 it will surely remain the best deal
around. And there are blueprints for much more _ a pool, a tennis
court, a bowling green.
</P>
<P>
   There are lots of changes these days in South Africa's most
famous black township. The dusty streets that used to snake all
over Soweto _ home to perhaps 4 million people, most of them living
in shacks or government-issue matchbox houses _ are almost a thing
of the past. Hundreds of miles of roads have been paved since the
African National Congress came to power in 1994. Some 2,000 street
lights have been installed. Garbage is collected. Water is far more
reliable.
</P>
<P>
   And everywhere there are signs of the kind of ambition driving
the remake of the Country Club. Under the former government,
commerce was strictly controlled to force Sowetans to buy from
white-owned stores in downtown Johannesburg. These days, however,
Soweto has several new shopping areas of its own and a mall.
</P>
<P>
   There are dozens of new restaurants _ including a pizza parlor,
an art gallery, two bed-and-breakfasts and a cafe where you can eat
brunch and drink cappuccino under pink umbrellas.
</P>
<P>
   Soweto has always been an afterthought of urban geography _ a
centerless bedroom community for black South Africans set up just
close enough to downtown so they could get to work, but just far
enough away so that tanks could close off the roads if unrest broke
out. Even the golf course, some say, was built to create a buffer
zone between black and mixed-race areas.
</P>
<P>
   But many here hope that the township, which nurtured great
anti-apartheid leaders like Nelson Mandela and Desmond Tutu and was
the setting for some of the liberation movement's most brutal
confrontations, will someday be a vibrant city of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, we are going to get there,'' said Stella Dubazana,
who opened Soweto's first pizza parlor two years ago, Palazzo di
Stella, in a former police station. ``We have a lot of hope.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 tourists visit each day, but most spend only a
few hours on guided tours and return to the lush hotels of the
northern suburbs to eat and to shop. Mrs. Dubazana and others would
like them to stay a little longer.
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen Soweto business people have gotten together to
offer a tour of Soweto's ``shebeens,'' the illegal taverns that
blacks used to run in the townships. The tour includes stops like
the pizzeria and the art gallery as well.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Nompula, the golf club's president, would like to see
the tourists play golf too. ``Why not?'' he says. ``They could meet
people here and really talk to Sowetans.''
</P>
<P>
   There are a few problems however. The greens don't stay green
all year _ wrong kind of grass. The sand traps don't have any sand
_ too expensive. And the players must remove branches from the
holes before they putt. The club has flags, but they come out only
on special occasions. The club lost 72 flags last year. Soweto's
poorer residents steal them for curtain rods.
</P>
<P>
   But Nompula's dreams see past all this. ``Maybe in another five
years,'' he says. ``People will look at this golf course and
they'll say, `What a beautiful club _ we didn't know what you were
talking about.'''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, crime and unemployment remain major issues in
Soweto. The township has the highest rate of car hijacking in the
country. Just last month, Mandela apologized to the visiting head
of the West Indies Cricket Board after he, his wife and two escorts
were robbed while visiting Soweto's only cricket oval. Gunmen
forced them to lie down in the parking lot and stole their cash,
jewelry and car.
</P>
<P>
   And many who can now afford it are leaving Soweto for the white
suburbs, often because they want better schools for their children.
</P>
<P>
   The golf club once had 800 members. But these days blacks can
play on any course if they have the money, so membership has
dwindled to 200.
</P>
<P>
   The club has attracted some white members of late. But in many
cases they have no intention of playing here _ they only want to
get an official handicap cheaply. So they pay their dues and play
as guests at fancier clubs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice to see some of them become active members
instead of just using it as a bridge to the milk and honey,'' said
Martin Pinto, who just finished a term as the president of the
South African Golf Association.
</P>
<P>
   Nompula says that even some black players do the same _ running
to him at the last minute to get their handicaps because they want
to enter a tournament at some other club. But in recent years, the
club has been able to make some improvements, in part with
government funding.
</P>
<P>
   But Nompula says the club cannot ask the government for more
when so many people lack housing, schools and water. He wants
private investors.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't like to harp on the past. Bygones should be bygones,
he said, although he added, ``It did have a certain effect on us
and we could use some help.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On a recent weekend, there were foursomes all over the course,
though no white players were to be seen. In the afternoon, the men
gathered on the pink leatherette sofas to watch soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the players have recently found good jobs and can only
now afford a game like golf. Others have been playing for years and
remember the early days when they could not play in the white
clubs. Nowadays, they have all at least tried the plush ``white''
courses. ``There,'' said J.J. Motha, who at 77 has been playing for
40 years, ``when you play badly, you have only yourself to blame.''
</P>
<P>
   In three years, Nompula says, if all goes well, the South
African Open could be played here.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lovely place, relaxed,'' he said. ``No hooligans
here. We just need a little help.''

 &HT;    Astros `stunned,' `outraged' at demands of Clemens' agents
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ The Houston Astros have decided they can't
afford Roger Clemens but would not resign quietly Sunday, club
general manager Gerry Hunsicker delivering a final salvo at
Clemens' agent in what has become one of the most peculiar
attempted transactions is the game's history.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Astros were a leading candidate to fulfill Clemens'
requested trade from Toronto, the club terminated talks when Alan
and Randy Hendricks, Clemens' Houston-based agents, demanded the
five-time Cy Young winner's contract (worth $16.1 million over the
next two years) be restructured for an additional season at a cost
of $27.4 million. That would bring the three-year value of the deal
at $43.5 million, and with an average annual payout of $14.5
million, would rival the monster $105 million deal Kevin Brown
agreed to with Los Angeles Saturday, which will pay him $15 million
per season.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros, who also had to pull out of the Randy Johnson
bidding when it grew too high, were simply offended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite frankly, we were absolutely stunned and really outranged
at the demands represented by the agent (Saturday) when they
conveyed the terms they were looking for,'' Hunsicker said. ``At
this point, we're not in a position financially to consider this.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we were, the talent that we'd potentially have to give
up, in addition to the talent we'd have to trade to accommodate his
restructuring into our payroll would leave us with a team that I'm
not sure Roger Clemens would be interested in being a part of.''
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Texas, Colorado and the New York Yankees still in
contention and if the Rangers are now the front-runner, the process
is hardly simpler. Though the Blue Jays are pursuing a trade (no
personnel was finalized with Houston), the Hendricks are treating
the financial end almost as if Clemens is a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's oneups-manship, is what is is,'' Hunsicker said.
``Certainly, we're not in a position to compete with some of the
madness that has taken place in some corners of the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the border
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays continued to act as if Clemens will be gone soon
when the team acquired San Diego pitcher and Atlanta resident Joey
Hamilton in a four-man deal. The Blue Jays sent back right-handed
veteran Woody Williams, right-handed reliever Carlos Almanzar and
minor league outfielder Peter Tucci, the club's first-round draft
pick in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we trade Roger, we want to make sure we maintain a
competitive ballclub,'' said Toronto GM Gord Ash. ``We believe in
Joey Hamilton, we've added another starter to the front end of the
rotation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, who had drawn interest in the past from the Braves,
was 13-13 last season with a 4.27 ERA in 34 starts, working 217
innings.
</P>
<P>
   Remaking the Mets
</P>
<P>
   Making their fourth major acquisition of the offseason, the New
York Mets signed outfielder Rickey Henderson to a $1.8 million
deal, giving the club a potent lead-off hitter as the Mets try to
close the gap in the NL East. New York will be Henderson's sixth
team. He hit .236 but scored 101 runs and walked 118 times in
Oakland last year. He joins Bobby Bonilla, Armando Benitez and
Robin Ventura as new Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Incidently, he will wear No. 24, the first Met assigned that
number since Willie Mays in 1972. New York officials reported the
immortal Kelvin Torve wore No. 24 for a few games in 1990-91 but
that he had been issued the number ``inadvertently.''
</P>
<P>
   Table for two
</P>
<P>
   Bob Gebhart has to pay up. The Colorado general manager was so
certain the Braves would swoop in at the last moment and sign free
agent Kevin Brown that Gebhart wagered a dinner with Atlanta GM
John Schuerholz that Brown would wind up a Brave. Schuerholz
countered with five sets of golf clubs. Brown's record signing came
and went without so much as a call of inquiry from Atlanta.

SPORTS COLUMN: MIAMI MIRRORS JETS' HISTORY AND EMOTIONS
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Fla., N.Y.)   (ms) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Whenever the Jets are on a roll, Miami is usually in
their travel plans.
</P>
<P>
   Miami, of course, is where the 1968 Jets fulfilled Joe Namath's
``guarantee'' in Super Bowl III. Miami is where the 1982 Jets got
stuck in the mud against the Dolphins in the American Football
Conference championship game, alias the strange case of the missing
tarpaulin. Miami is where Raul Allegre's overtime field goal lifted
the 1991 Jets into the playoffs in their season finale.
</P>
<P>
   And Sunday night, Miami is where the 1998 Jets were playing the
Dolphins for first place in the East Division.
</P>
<P>
   In each of these crossroad games, palm trees swayed in the
breeze _ outside the Orange Bowl for Super Bowl III and the muddy
AFC championship game, outside Pro Player Stadium for Allegre's
field goal and, Sunday night, for Bill Parcells' stomping on the
sideline.
</P>
<P>
   The storyline of each game has mirrored the various emotions of
Jets history: celebration, frustration, expectation and aspiration.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells keeps talking about aspiring ``to get there,'' meaning
the Super Bowl XXXIII playoffs. He would prefer to get there with a
first-place team, ideally with a bye through the wild-card weekend
into the divisional playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jets can't be choosy, not after having been 4-28 in the
two seasons before Parcells arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Of their four crossroad games in Miami, the uncommon denominator
is that the Jets have had a different coach each time _ the late
Weeb Ewbank in Super Bowl III, Walt Michaels in the mud, Bruce
Coslet when Allegre kicked the field goal, Parcells now.
</P>
<P>
   When the Jets stunned the pro football realm with their 16-7
defeat of the Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl III, it was only the
franchise's ninth season. Surely there would be more celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the Jets, despite finishing first again in their
division, were knocked out of the 1969 playoffs by the Kansas City
Chiefs in the Shea Stadium freezer. And the Jets haven't finished
first since then _ the only National Football League team among
those involved in the 1970 merger realignment not to win a division
title.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, a season interrupted by a players' strike, the Jets had
a 6-3 record, tied for fourth in the overall standing. In the
playoffs, they quickly routed the Cincinnati Bengals, 44-17, as
Freeman McNeil galloped for 202 yards, then jarred the Los Angeles
Raiders, 17-14, as linebacker Lance Mehl had two interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Jets arrived at the Orange Bowl for the A.F.C.
championship game, the field resembled a rice paddy. Despite heavy
rain on Thursday and mostly steady rain thereafter until almost
game time, the field had been left uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   When the Jets lost, 14-0, their president, the late Jim Kensil,
growled about the absence of a tarpaulin. So did their coach, Walt
Michaels, who quietly suspected Don Shula, the Dolphins' coach, of
having created the mud to sabotage the Jets' offense, which
depended on the speed of McNeil and wide receiver Wesley Walker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I know is the rules,'' Michaels grumbled. ``I
can't understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Michaels was alluding to the NFL constitution that requires each
team to have a tarpaulin available. But the Dolphins blamed the
absence of a tarpaulin on the City of Miami, which operates the
Orange Bowl. Whoever was at fault, the Jets lost.
</P>
<P>
   About two weeks later, Michaels lost his job as the Jets'
coach. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Early in the final week of the 1991 season, Allegre, the kicker
on the 1986 Giants team that won Super Bowl XXI, was home in
Austin, Tex., when his phone rang. The Jets needed a kicker for
their finale in Miami. Pat Leahy, the Jets' longtime kicker, had
hamstring and sciatic problems.
</P>
<P>
   As time expired in the Jets' finale, Allegre booted a 44-yard
field goal to tie the score at 20-20. In overtime, he kicked a
30-yard field goal for a 23-20 victory. With an 8-8 record, the
Jets had sneaked into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was just one of those destiny-type things,'' Allegre
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jets' real destiny was to lose their wild-card playoff
in Houston. The Oilers won, 17-10, in a game that turned on two
plays at the Oilers' 3-yard line _ quarterback Ken O'Brien was
intercepted in the third quarter and McNeil was stopped for no gain
on fourth-and-1 in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   And Sunday night, with first place at stake in their division,
the Jets were in Miami again. Where else would they be? &QL;

WILLIAMS' RUNAWAY LEAVES NO HEISMAN TROPHY DOUBTS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was fitting that this year's Heisman Trophy week began with
the airing of a year-old grievance. In New York for a College
Football Hall of Fame banquet, Tennessee Coach Phillip Fulmer once
more expressed dismay over how his all-everything quarterback,
Peyton Manning, could have been passed over for the game's most
coveted trophy in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   When the announcement came at the Downtown Athletic Club last
year that Michigan's Charles Woodson, a defensive back and
occasional receiver, was the Heisman Trophy winner, the stunned
look on Manning's face pretty much summed up the confusing,
whimsical and sometimes vindictive nature of an all-out media
campaign for an honor that is supposed to designate the most
outstanding player in college football.
</P>
<P>
   ``We . . . I . . . have a different opinion of who was the best
player in the nation last year,'' Fulmer said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Nearby was Texas Coach Mack Brown, who was just beginning a week
of award appearances on behalf of his splendid running back Ricky
Williams. Even though Williams capped off his yearlong status as
the Heisman front-runner by earning the trophy Saturday night with
the third-highest first-place vote total in the award's 64-year
history, Brown's face flashed a grave look of anticipated
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Like the game these coaches have dedicated their lives to, the
outcome of the Heisman vote isn't always fair.
</P>
<P>
   In Manning's case, the only mistakes the gifted quarterback made
were not beating Florida and having his famous lineage (son of
Archie) and All-America off-field demeanor become overexposed.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Woodson wasn't a worthy choice. His opportunistic
defense, his penchant for big plays as a part-time wide receiver
and sheer return artistry powered Michigan to a perfect record and
a share of the national title. But he was perhaps aided by a
Manning backlash among voters who didn't think the Tennessee
quarterback's on-field accomplishments matched his media-enhanced
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Williams had a different set of obstacles. He began as the
front-runner by having led the nation in rushing in 1997, finishing
a distant fifth in the Heisman voting, and by being within 2,000
yards of breaking Tony Dorsett's 22-year-old Division I career
rushing record.
</P>
<P>
   He was the front-runner nobody liked because the Longhorns were
coming off a 4-7 season, Brown was a first-year coach from North
Carolina who presumably needed to rebuild, and well, the running
back was a different-looking sort. In Austin, no less than the
coaching legend Darrell Royal and the 1977 Heisman winner Earl
Campbell had heart-to-heart talks with Williams about losing the
dreadlocks and the stud in his tongue and playing down the tattoos.
</P>
<P>
   But coach, runner and the university's sports information
department were determined to turn these perceived negatives into
positives. Brown inherited a mixed bag at Texas, but knew that in
Williams he had a once-in-a-lifetime recruiting tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hoped I could sit in living rooms,'' Brown said, ``and tell
parents, `I had a kid from California who passed up millions to
return for his senior year and won the Heisman Trophy. That's the
kind of place the University of Texas is.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Next, he challenged his team to win the games necessary for
Williams to be considered Heisman-worthy. But the Longhorns got off
to a 1-2 start, losing to teams led by the Heisman's eventual
second- and third-place finishers, quarterbacks Michael Bishop of
Kansas State and Cade McNown of U.C.L.A.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first questions were all about Ricky and if this knocks
him out of the Heisman,'' Brown said of the 48-7 loss to Kansas
State in which Williams was held to 39 yards. ``I had a whole team
to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Longhorns reeled off six consecutive victories on their
way to an 8-3 season and a date in the Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Heisman Trophy is supposed to be an individual award, but
in this case, it was a team award,'' Williams said. ``My teammates
played hard for me.''
</P>
<P>
   The running back also was gracious in thanking John Bianco, the
sports information director who promoted his candidacy. It was a
decidedly low-tech campaign in an era of video highlight e-mails
and incessant mass mailings of postcards and glossy photos. Before
the season, Bianco summed up his strategy this way: ``I'm not going
to do anything but get Ricky in front of people. He's a good guy
with a great story that people will like.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams never succumbed to the advice from Royal and Campbell,
but spoke movingly about returning for his senior year to continue
his education studies. He talked football, music, history and what
a great time he was having in college.
</P>
<P>
   He gave voters every reason to look at his numbers. He owns all
or part of 16 Division I records, including most career rushing
yards _ 6,279.
</P>
<P>
   He won the Heisman Trophy by the fourth-largest victory margin,
and his countenance will certainly liven up the portrait room in
the Downtown Athletic Club. And next year, no one will have a
reason to wonder how he got there.

DIMAGGIO REDRAWS HIS CURTAIN OF PRIVACY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The doctor announced that he couldn't talk about Joe DiMaggio's
health anymore, couldn't say if DiMaggio's condition had been
upgraded from critical to serious. But the fact that his mouth had
been zippered was the most reliable repot we could possibly get
that the arrow on the daily Joe D. stock exchange was pointing up.
</P>
<P>
   ``No more press,'' Dr. Earl Barron reported the 84-year-old
DiMaggio to have growled Sunday from his hospital room in
Hollywood, Fla., the best evidence that DiMaggio was alert enough
to demand the curtain be drawn on what had become a sad spinoff of
``The Truman Show.''
</P>
<P>
   If DiMaggio never beats the assault on his lungs and makes it
out of Memorial Regional Hospital, at least he will have recovered
sufficiently to reclaim his privacy, which to him always
represented the measure of his dignity. What kind of man DiMaggio
really is, where people may want to place him in the all-time
congeniality rankings, is not what we're talking about. The issue
here is that DiMaggio decades ago chose to conduct his life far
away from the eye of the very camera his doctors had apparently
fallen in love with over the last couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody had to ask where Joe DiMaggio had gone, or wonder how
close he was to being gone, because what appeared to be his final
hours had become just another energy source for the insatiable
beast known as the hourly news cycle. With DiMaggio rendered
unconscious or too weak to know, the doctors and even his friend
and spokesman, Morris Engelberg, trampled on what surely would have
been DiMaggio's last wish, to not have the details of his endgame
disseminated like so many canned post-game quotes.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, there was a clear window into the life of a man who
for 47 years following his retirement from baseball had chosen to
keep the shades drawn. Did we really need to have a play-by-play on
the level of sedation, on the amount of fluid in his lungs, on the
variety of tubes in his throat? Did we have to be in the middle of
his family's anguished decision on how long to continue with life
support? To whose benefit was the constant rating of DiMaggio's
chances of survival, as if the country were keeping score, on the
scale of 1 to 10?
</P>
<P>
   Barry Halper, more than most, knew how DiMaggio would have
detested the news-flash frenzy, which produced a pitiful cliche of
a zipper report regarding DiMaggio's health that Halper came upon
in Times Square the other day. ``Last of the ninth,'' it screamed,
``two out.'' All that was missing was the free distribution of
rally caps and a heartfelt request for rhythmic applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe, I guess, was gravely ill, and he couldn't possibly know
what was going on,'' Halper said Sunday from his New Jersey home.
</P>
<P>
   Known for his collection of baseball memorabilia, as well as a
minuscule share of Yankees ownership, Halper in recent years had
served as driver and companion when DiMaggio made his infrequent
trips to New York. Always, the object was to take care of business,
stay out of sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd go out to dinner, they'd put him in a back room where no
one would bother him,'' Halper said. ``Once in a while, a drifter
would come over, ask for an autograph. But it wasn't as difficult
as people think.''
</P>
<P>
   There are times now when athletes like Michael Jordan talk about
their fame as if it were an uncontrollable curse. Can't go here,
can't go there. Most of the time, it sounds very convincing until
the subject of DiMaggio comes up, and to the whining stars you just
want to pose the following question: ``Ever heard of the back
door?''
</P>
<P>
   Some of these premature DiMaggio eulogies, casting him as the
last pure American icon, have been a bit much. On the scale of
relative sports fame, Jordan himself rates a global 9.5. But
DiMaggio does epitomize the increasingly rare surviving celebrity
never nourished by the sight of a television camera. He has
presented himself only when he wished to, defiantly unwilling to
live by the sound bite. He apparently set the same rules for those
who wanted to remain his friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Joe first went in the hospital, people started calling me
up for interviews about his health,'' Halper said. ``I didn't know
anything, so I couldn't say much.'' Whatever he said was already
too much. He soon received a letter from DiMaggio's lawyers, asking
that he ``cease and desist.''
</P>
<P>
   In the early weeks of his confinement, DiMaggio succeeded, the
way he always did, in keeping a lid on his illustrious life. As the
circumstances worsened, then grew grave, maybe the doctors figured
they owed more to the public than they did to their patient. What
the heck. In Ken Starr's America, the most salacious grand jury
testimony is the centerfold of the daily newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio, no more the man of mystery, had become another
phenomenon of the Internet. But when he awoke the other day and
learned the whole country had been in his room, surveying his
struggle, that was enough. ``No more press,'' he said, having come
back to life to live it his way.

NEBRASKA'S KERREY SAYS NO TO PRESIDENTIAL BID 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Neb., Tenn., Minn., N.J., Mo., Mass.)  (jw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAHA, Neb. _ Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., announced Sunday that he
would not run for president in 2000, explaining that after several
months of pondering his political future, he had concluded that his
talents could be best applied on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey, 55, said Vice President Al Gore's current strong lead in
the race for the nomination influenced his decision not to make a
second White House bid. He was briefly a candidate in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   But other factors were at play, too, he added, saying that the
most important of them was the political debt he owed his fellow
Nebraskans, who elected him to two terms in the Senate. Kerrey then
asked them to return him to Washington for a third term in 2000,
when he will be up for re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``My choice is not whether or not I will try to lead,'' he said
at a news conference. ``My choice is how best can I lead. I have
made this decision here at home with my family and with my friends.
They simply will not allow conceit or selfish hunger for power to
seduce me into making a false choice.''
</P>
<P>
   While Gore's strong early lead among Democrats may have given
Kerrey second thoughts about the race, other Democrats have
indicated they may try to take him on.
</P>
<P>
   Both Sen. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota and former Sen. Bill
Bradley of New Jersey have formed committees to help them explore
whether to run. Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, Sen. John Kerry
of Massachusetts and the Rev. Jesse Jackson say they may join the
contest.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey said that while he would not be a presidential candidate
in 2000, he still would try to influence the debate, especially on
national defense, Social Security and education.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey had promised a decision by year's end. He met Sunday for
about two hours with 100 relatives, friends and political advisers.
The senator said he had told them he thought he should continue
representing Nebraska in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not persuaded otherwise,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some encouraged him to run, Kerrey said, and some urged him not
to. He said Gene Glock, a Nebraska farmer and adviser on
agricultural policy, had told him that he should return to private
life because political life seemed to be wearing him out.
</P>
<P>
   Kerrey, a divorced former Navy SEAL who lost his leg in the
Vietnam War, was Nebraska's governor from 1983 to 1987. Choosing
not to seek re-election in 1986, he won a Senate seat in 1988 and
was re-elected in 1994. He sought the 1992 Democratic presidential
nomination but withdrew in March.
</P>
<P>
   His name came up in 1992 as a vice-presidential possibility.
Kerrey said he would go to Tennessee and talk to Gore about such a
place on the 2000 ticket if the vice president was nominated and
called him.
</P>
<P>
   But Kerrey added, ``I don't feel that my skills are applied very
well in any position that has vice and a hyphen in front of it.''

BOXING LOSES AN ORIGINAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Boxing lost a true wonder when it lost Archie Moore.
</P>
<P>
   The former light heavyweight champion, known for a his big
punch, ring savvy and delightful wit, died in San Diego at what was
believed to be 84 on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Consider just a few of his deeds:
</P>
<P>
   He had a record 141 knockouts, according to The Boxing Record
Book. That's more FIGHTS than all but a few boxers have amassed in
their careers.
</P>
<P>
   He fought for 27 years, from 1936 to 1963. He began his pro
career only eight years after Jack Dempsey's last fight and ended
up in the ring with Cassius Clay (now Muhammad Ali). And his career
wasn't like that of Roberto Duran or Larry Holmes today: He was a
remarkably capable fighter until near the end, at 49.
</P>
<P>
   He was the only one to have fought both Rocky Marciano and Ali.
He almost stopped Marciano before he was knocked out himself in the
ninth round in 1955 but was much too slow to cope with Ali and fell
in four in 1962. He was 48 in that fight.
</P>
<P>
   I once asked him who was better, Marciano or Ali. Always a
diplomat, he just smiled and said, ``They were both good.''
</P>
<P>
   He defended the light-heavyweight title, which he won at 39 by
outpointing Joey Maxim in 1952, 11 times over a span of 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   He had engaged in 169 bouts over the span of 17 years before he
got that opportunity to fight for the championship _ his first
title shot. That's perseverance.
</P>
<P>
   He was one of the principals in one of the greatest fights ever.
He got up from four brain-jarring knockdowns _ three in the first
round _ to stop Yvon Durelle in the 11th in a title defense.
</P>
<P>
   As the story goes, after the fourth knockdown, his wily manager
Doc Kearns had him wave to his wife, whom he was told was sitting
behind Durelle, when all the while she was sitting elsewhere.
Durelle, believing Moore was waving at him, became unnerved in a
turning point in the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Boxing historian Bert Sugar rates Moore the greatest light
heavyweight and 23rd best fighter of any weight in his ``The 100
Greatest Boxers of All-Time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He epitomized the light-heavyweight division,'' Sugar said.
</P>
<P>
   Moore had his disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   He had to wait so long for his shot at the title principally
because he was African-American and so talented. He had to fight
Maxim for only $800 to get his opportunity finally. He spent a lot
of time on what was called the ``Black Circuit,'' fighting other
top African-American fighters who shared a similar fate.
</P>
<P>
   Moore, a natural light heavyweight who weighed no more than 206
pounds in any fight, never claimed the one prize he so wanted: the
heavyweight title. He lost to Marciano in 1955 (at 41) and Floyd
Patterson the following year in his only two opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   He always saw the Marciano fight as the one that got away. Years
later, Moore said that had referee Howie Kessler simply wiped off
Marciano's gloves after the champ went down in the second round
instead of yanking his arms _ which helped pump life back into him
_ Moore might've won the title.
</P>
<P>
   As it was, Moore never complained.
</P>
<P>
   The media loved him because he loved to talk and because of what
he had to say. He was a self-promoter long before Ali. Television
analyst and former sportswriter Larry Merchant tells the story of
how Moore used to write long, engaging letters to the writers as a
way of marketing himself. And he was always armed with one-liners.
</P>
<P>
   One example is the discrepancy in his age. Moore's mother said
he was born in 1913; he said he was born in 1916. Moore's
explanation?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've given this a lot of thought,'' he said, ``and have
decided that I must have been three when I was born.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, he was a lovable, witty and well-respected
character. More than anything, though, he was a fighter's fighter _
even without the heavyweight crown.
</P>
<P>
   He accomplished more after the age of 39 than all but a few
boxers have in their entire careers. If there was ever a
one-of-a-kind figure in this sport, Moore was it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Archie, to me, was the forerunner of fighters who were
appreciated outside the ring as well as in the ring,'' veteran
trainer Angelo Dundee told the Associated Press. ``He was slick, he
was smart, he was his own PR man.
</P>
<P>
   ``The media loved him because he gave them something, plus he
could fight like hell.''
</P>
<P>
   __ New champ: Here's a prediction: Fernando Vargas of Oxnard,
Calif., who easily beat Yory Boy Campas on Saturday to win the IBF
junior middleweight title, will turn out to be the best of the 1996
U.S. Olympic fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Show me a weakness. The 21-year-old has all the physical tools
and the poise of a much more experienced fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Against Campas, he demonstrated that a significant edge in
natural ability can more than compensate for lack of experience. It
was a masterful performance, particularly for such a young fighter.
</P>
<P>
   __ Title town?: With Vargas and IBF junior-lightweight
titleholder Robert Garcia, Oxnard has two world champions.
</P>
<P>
   Few COUNTRIES have two world champions.
</P>
<P>
   __ Enough: Arturo Gatti, who lost another tough decision to Ivan
Robinson in Saturday's main event, has given boxing fans enough
thrills.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't need to take any more punches.
</P>
<P>
   __ Next up: New WBC super featherweight champion Floyd
Mayweather faces tough Angel Manfredy, Saturday on HBO.
</P>
<P>
   Manfredy's most impressive performance was his victory over
Gatti, whose straight-ahead style is the antithesis of
Mayweather's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I land 50 percent of my punches. Gatti gets HIT with 50
percent of the other guy's punches. You're going to see a
completely different fight. I'm ready,'' Mayweather said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayweather has his sights set on Naseem Hamed.
</P>
<P>
   __ Country Club: Michael Carbajal is expected to pull out of the
Dec. 17 card at the San Fernando Valley site because of the flu.
</P>
<P>
   If so, the former junior flyweight champ will act as color
commentator on the Spanish-language broadcast of the fight on
Channel 22.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it could be a wild night. On the undercard, unbeaten
Tiffany Logan, 200 pounds, will face 300-pound Michelle Lockhart in
a most unusual women's bout.
</P>
<P>
   Logan is promoted by Magic Johnson, who is co-promoting the
card.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Kelley faces Jorge Cocas Ramirez in the main event.
</P>
<P>
   __ Canceled: The Retired Boxers Foundation's awards benefit that
was scheduled for this month was canceled for lack of money.
Founder Alex Ramos said he won't give up.

SPORTS COLUMN: A GUT CHECK BY FASSEL &AMP; COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD , N.J. _ Imagine you are a singer preparing to
belt your best tune and staring you down is Whitney Houston.
Imagine you are primed for the talk-show circuit and in your
opposing slot is Oprah Winfrey. You are a designer and the
competition is Tommy Hilfiger. You have a nice car and what rolls
up and parks alongside is a Rolls-Royce.
</P>
<P>
   You are Jim Fassel.
</P>
<P>
   In the house is Mike Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   That was the scene at Giants Stadium Sunday afternoon. Sure, it
was the Broncos versus the Giants, the players on the field making
it happen. But it was also Fassel and his staff versus Shanahan and
his staff.
</P>
<P>
   All week long, all season long, Fassel and his staff had heard
about the greatness of Shanahan &AMP; Company. The mastermind. The
genius. Ahead of the curve. Whipping opposing coaches in
preparation and in game-day decision-making. And so much of it was
true. The Denver Broncos entered with 13 victories and no defeats
and were on the road to history, to a perfect 16-0 regular season.
They had been good, but they had also been cunning. Clever.
Deceptive.
</P>
<P>
   If you are the opponent, no matter how much respect you have for
the other guys, it is enough to make you sick. You tire of it. And
this was Fassel Sunday. This was his staff, especially the
defensive coordinator, John Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you are matched against greatness, you cannot help
but want to compete and be at your best,'' Fox said. ``With what
Denver was trying to achieve, this was one of those rare chances in
life. This was why we do this as a living.''
</P>
<P>
   A 5-8 team battling a 13-0 team.
</P>
<P>
   A coaching staff losing its luster, questioned and even berated
now, against a superstar bunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a test for Coach Fassel and our staff and it was a
crucial test,'' said Jessie Armstead, the Giants' rumbling
linebacker, seldom one to mince words. ``His back was against the
wall. Nobody was saying it, but him and all of our coaches, like
us, were wounded and hurt over the way this season has gone. This
game of football is all about testing your will and your pride. It
is all about matchups.''
</P>
<P>
   Matchups of the players.
</P>
<P>
   Matchups of the coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Players have gut checks.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches do, too.
</P>
<P>
   Well, Jim Fassel passed his. So did his staff. Their 20-16
victory over the Broncos placed a big bandage over some open,
gushing wounds. It stopped the bleeding. It made the Giants the
talk of the National Football League. They stopped a team that was
streaking like a missile toward a perfect mark. They made it the
way it was, for them, last season.
</P>
<P>
   Last season the Giants won the National Football Conference
East, and Fassel was coach of the year. They were a 10-5-1 team and
defense was their cornerstone.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel entered this season saying he knew the Giants must
change. He said that the offense had to do more. Make more big
plays. Throw the ball downfield more. Be more daring, more
productive.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Sehorn was supposed to help the offense. The star
cornerback would return kickoffs and give the offense better field
position. But Sehorn was injured in the preseason. Other injuries
hurt both the offense and the defense. And then Fassel ignited
flames within his team. He would not use Tyrone Wheatley as his
running back. Receiver Amani Toomer remained a role player. The
quarterback position became unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   And Fassel struggled in his play-calling along with his team.
There appeared little cohesion, and the Giants kept stumbling, all
the way to a 5-8 record. Who understands the Wheatley deal? No one,
not even Fassel's own players. And the talented Toomer being used
consistently as a role player? Even among the Giants, there has
been the feeling, the notion, that Fassel has not been playing the
best players with enough frequency. That he has played his
favorites even though they have not produced. That, in turn, he has
not given his team the best chance to win.
</P>
<P>
   Players have their views.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches have theirs.
</P>
<P>
   I remember asking a current NFL coach, if he had a star running
back who was by far the best player on the team and that back did
not practice well or prepare well but would still score three
touchdowns a game, would he play him? He said no. He said the back
might win a few games but in the end the coach would lose his team.
Well, a coach in that situation might lose it, anyway, if he makes
that decision and the team does not know why.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   How much, if any, is the case with Wheatley? Why have we not
seen more of Toomer, such a playmaker, on a Giants offense that is
strapping for big plays?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been ready for that ball for a long time,'' Toomer said
of his game-winning catch, the 37-yard touchdown grab with 48
seconds left. ``I've been waiting a long time to do more.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Kent Graham, the quarterback, threw it. But it is up
to Fassel, the coach, to keep Toomer in the game. It is up to
Fassel to call the play during practice all week and to demand that
Graham understand that there is where the ball should go. Just as
it did.
</P>
<P>
   As it did with the tricky 21-yard scoring pass from Graham to
running back Tiki Barber just before halftime, giving the Giants a
10-6 lead. ``On my touchdown,'' Barber said, ``it is a play that
has been in our playbook forever. We have rarely called it. It took
advantage of how they like to crowd their linebackers and pass rush
into the middle. I got outside and there was no one there. They
said our receiver picked their linebacker. There was maybe some
small contact, but that's football. The Broncos do that in their
offense all of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   But this time, Fassel did it to Denver.
</P>
<P>
   His third-down calls and the play of the Giants' offensive line
all day, but especially there, made the difference in this game.
The Giants were 9 of 15 (60 percent) on converting third-down
plays. The Giants entered the game having converted a league-worst
25 percent on third downs. Fassel settled for a field goal late and
Denver took the lead, but Fassel and the Giants produced the
two-minute drill that won the game. And that is all that matters.
</P>
<P>
   Shanahan even admitted that the Giants won the guessing game on
third down on both sides of the ball, especially since the Denver
offense was limited to 6 of 14 (43 percent) on third-down
conversions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense was not used to our offense keeping possession
like that,'' Armstead said. ``And then Coach Fox mixed it up on
their offense and helped us make them punt a lot. We were using the
Far Dog, blitzing away from the running back. And then when they
expected that, we would use the Double Dog and blitz right at the
running back. Things like that kept their offense off stride.''
</P>
<P>
   And for most of the day, out of the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   What a joy for Fassel and his staff, what a moment! They will be
remembered as the team that derailed Denver's grasp for glory,
especially if Denver finishes the regular season at 15-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Coach Fassel came into the locker room after the game,
the thrill in his eyes and the look on his face _ I had not seen
that since we won the NFC East last year,'' Barber said.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel said he would not look back. What could have been this
year is gone. Mistakes have been made. The wrong guess, the wrong
turn by his staff, by his players too many times along the way have
made them a 6-8 team. Injuries hurt. They underachieved. Sometimes
they were simply not good enough. A lack of cohesion. All of it now
makes the playoffs for the Giants a possibility that is more like a
fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   But Fassel said it best: This Giants team, this Giants season,
will be remembered for this game.
</P>
<P>
   And so will his staff.
</P>
<P>
   And so will he.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Pentagon has asked President Clinton for the
largest increase in military spending since the first four years of
Ronald Reagan's Cold War buildup, but the administration has balked
at the size of the request, having already pledged to preserve
budget surpluses for the Social Security system.
</P>
<P>
   After years of dwindling resources following the collapse of the
Soviet Union, Defense Department officials express hopes that
Clinton will propose the Pentagon's first real increase in military
spending since 1991, when the military budget spiked slightly for
the Persian Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   But their hopes for a large increase in next year's budget _
stoked by encouraging words from Clinton himself _ have waned in
recent weeks as a White House battling impeachment also scrambles
to find ways to support Social Security and balance competing
demands from other agencies, administration and defense officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon's concerns have become so acute that Secretary of
Defense William Cohen and Gen. Henry Shelton, the chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, delayed their departures on separate trips
to Europe this week. Instead, they will stay in Washington to press
their case in pivotal budget meetings at the White House on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to fight for our money,'' a defense official said on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with Clinton last Monday, Cohen, Shelton and the
chiefs of the Army, Navy, Air Force and Marine Corps argued for at
least a $10 billion increase in spending in next year's budget and
a $112 billion increase over the next six years, the officials
said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Next year's increase _ to pay for everything from spare parts to
raises for the troops to the peacekeeping mission in Bosnia _ would
represent a roughly 4 percent increase above the Department of
Defense's current $258 billion budget, the largest annual increase
since 1984. Between now and 2006, the annual increases would grow
steadily to $25 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   But Cohen and the chiefs left that meeting without a firm pledge
for any increase. And while Clinton expressed support in principle
for addressing problems with the military's readiness, the
officials said it now seemed unlikely that the president would
propose more than a modest increase, if any, when he unveils his
budget proposal in February for the 2000 fiscal year, which begins
next October.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a lot of sympathy for their needs over
there,'' an administration official said. ``But I don't think that
even in a perfect world, they would get every penny they're asking
for.''
</P>
<P>
   The wrangling has created a political problem for Clinton, who
already faces intensifying pressure from Republicans in Congress to
increase military spending. After inviting Cohen and the chiefs to
submit requests for more money, Clinton will now face criticism for
giving anything less than the amount they have calculated as
necessary to keep the nation's military fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's been a spirit of expectation built up by a lot of
folks that have heard what the president's been saying,'' one
military officer said.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Dennis Reimer, the Army's chief of staff, described last
week's meeting with the president as an ``honest exchange,'' and he
conceded that the Pentagon's demands had to be weighed against the
constraints of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are complex issues,'' he told reporters at a breakfast
on Thursday. ``There's more involved than defense, obviously.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Reimer reiterated his belief that the Army
needed $5 billion a year above its current $64 billion budget ``to
do what we need to do the way it needs to be done.'' Without
adequate resources, he warned, the administration needed either to
reconsider its national security strategy or ``accept a hollowness
in the force that we're not willing to accept.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's aides emphasized that the president had not yet made a
decision on the Pentagon's budget. He must first decide, they said,
how to propose using the projected surpluses in the federal budget
to avert the looming insolvency in the Social Security system. And
then, they said, he could use any leftover surplus to pay for an
increase for the military.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Office of Management and Budget has pressed
Cohen and other Pentagon officials to pay for at least some of
their $112 billion request _ which Cohen's office has already pared
from $148 billion _ with savings from existing budget levels.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, $5 billion to $7 billion in savings resulting from
lower-than-expected inflation and oil costs are expected to cover
the raises and improved retirement benefits that Clinton has
already touted, in a speech on Veterans Day and in an appearance
before troops at Osan Air Force Base in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   Military leaders, led by Shelton, have made improving pay and
benefits _ including a raise of 3.9 percent this year and 4.4
percent next year _ a top priority. Without them, they say, it will
become even more difficult to attract and keep the most qualified
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've approved pay raises that will significantly reduce the
gap between military and civilian pay,'' Clinton told an assembly
of troops at Osan on Nov. 22, who responded with hearty applause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ought to quit while I'm ahead,'' Clinton added.
</P>
<P>
   Military spending has declined sharply since President Reagan's
buildup of weaponry in the 1980s. In today's dollars, adjusted for
inflation, the Pentagon's budget has dropped 36 percent from a peak
of $403 billion in 1985 to $258 billion now, not counting the
Department of Energy's spending on nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   As a percentage of the federal budget, military spending is now
at just under 15 percent, as low as it has been since the end of
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   This ``peace dividend'' largely resulted from two things: the
cut in military personnel from 2.4 million soldiers, sailors,
airmen and marines to just over 1.4 million today and the ability
to put off the purchase of new major weapons following the infusion
under Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Pentagon officials say, the fighter jets and ships and
tanks bought in the Reagan years need replacing or at least lots of
spare parts. And the smaller forces are being asked to do more,
from boxing in Saddam Hussein to responding to natural disasters
like Hurricane Mitch to peacekeeping in Bosnia. (Ten percent of the
Pentagon's $112 billion request alone would pay for keeping the
troops in Bosnia.)
</P>
<P>
   ``To me those are extremely valuable things,'' the new secretary
of the navy, Richard Danzig, said of the peacekeeping and
humanitarian missions. ``They also create a lot of wear and tear
and burden on our resources and our people.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Cohen and the chiefs have become increasingly
vocal in warning about what they call an erosion of resources and
the resulting strain on troop strength, training and morale.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Gen. David Bramlett, commander of the Army's Forces
Command at Fort McPherson, Ga., warned that the Army had to divert
money from things like base maintenance to pay for training meant
to keep soldiers battle-ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot operate within current funding levels and have the
viable fighting force we want to project into the next century,''
Bramlett wrote in a memorandum that ended up being widely
circulated.
</P>
<P>
   In September, the nation's top commanders met with Clinton at
Fort McNair here in Washington and laid out what amounted to a plea
for more money to address the strains.
</P>
<P>
   A week later, Clinton responded with a letter to Cohen that many
in the Pentagon viewed as a firmer commitment to new resources than
it is turning out to be. ``We need to consider additional steps
that may be needed to preserve the quality of the American
military,'' the president said, though he pledged no specific
increase.
</P>
<P>
   Though officials declined to detail how they would spend the
increases, beyond bolstering pay and retirement benefits, they said
the extra money would not go for large new weapons as much as for
more mundane equipment, spare parts, jet fuel and other things
necessary for training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to fix the unsexy stuff,'' said Gen. Charles Krulak,
the commandant of the Marine Corps, who has been one of the only
commanders openly critical of Clinton's previous military budgets.
</P>
<P>
   At least some of the money would speed up the purchase of some
of the Pentagon's biggest weapons programs, including the Air
Force's F-22 and the Navy's F/A-18 fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
   Some administration officials and independent analysts said the
Pentagon was pleading poverty without having squeezed enough fat
out of its notoriously resistant bureaucracy or having reconsidered
any of its expensive modernization programs, like those fighters.
</P>
<P>
   They noted that since the end of the Persian Gulf War the United
States had not had to confront any new threat to its security that
would justify a large increase in spending. They also pointed out
that efforts to trim the bureaucracy _ like last year's Defense
Reform Initiative, which was to save $6 billion a year _ had so far
failed to produce significant savings.
</P>
<P>
   Michael O'Hanlon, an analyst at the Brookings Institution in
Washington, said that almost a decade after the Cold War, the
Pentagon still had not learned to adjust to fiscal constraints,
using the opportunity of a relatively peaceful world to create a
smaller, more efficient military.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pentagon hasn't made the cuts,'' O'Hanlon said. ``People
just waited for the first opportunity to ask for what they wanted
all along.''

POLLOCK, LING AND TRUE, BUT NARY A SCROD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ It is sometimes called Cape Cod Turkey, or Down East
Turkey. But it has no legs or feathers.
</P>
<P>
   Its image appears on bank notes in Nova Scotia as well as on the
seal of the Colony of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   It is at the center of debate between world historians, vendors
at Seattle's Pike Place Market and tourists who return home wearing
T-shirts reading: ``I Got Scrod in Boston.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they did. Maybe they didn't. The menu probably promised
small cod (or scrod), but the kitchen might have delivered fillets
of pollock instead.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes you don't know who to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Columbus didn't discover America. As he searched for spices and
gold, he was preceded by Norsemen and Basques who were fishing for
cod. It was probably the cod fisheries that led England to
establish colonies on this continent.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Atlantic cod have virtually vanished from the Grand Banks
due to overfishing and are equally as scarce at the Pike Place
Market. What are mainly sold here are Pacific or ``true'' cod,
which are smaller and lack the slightly sweet taste of the Atlantic
variety.
</P>
<P>
   Ling cod is an inferior product, purists insist.
</P>
<P>
   The Pike Place fish purveyors don't actually get into fistfights
with their customers on this subject, but they might if they didn't
have to keep their fists ready to receive or deliver flying fish of
the salmon variety known as kamikaze kings.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Intermediate Eater, well, my ancestors from Scotland
and Wales didn't come here for codfish. They were looking for big
bucks. Matter of fact, they're still looking.
</P>
<P>
   One way to save big bucks is to cook up a batch of cod cakes.
They taste almost as good as the much more expensive Dungeness crab
cakes when prepared like this:
</P>
<P>
   True Cod Cakes
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chopped celery
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup minced onion
</P>
<P>
   Canola oil
</P>
<P>
   3 slices white bread
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters pound true cod fillet
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons mayonnaise
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon Tabasco sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   In a large skillet saute the celery and onion in 1 tablespoon
oil until soft, then dump into a bowl and rub the skillet clean
with a paper towel.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a food processor, toss in the bread and hit the
button until you have coarse crumbs. Put two-thirds of the crumbs
in with the onion and celery and save the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Next put the cod into the processor bowl. Hit the button with
short bursts until the fish is minced. Don't lean on the button or
you will have a fish paste and that ain't pretty. If you do not
have a food processor, you can tear the bread into crumbs and mince
the fish with a sharp knife. It will just take a bit longer.
</P>
<P>
   OK, add the fish to the bowl with the onion, celery and crumbs.
Add the egg (or equivalent egg substitute), the mayo, Tabasco,
lemon juice and salt. Moosh everything around until blended. Then
divide the cod mixture into four parts and plop them onto waxed
paper. Pat them into patty shape and then refrigerate.
</P>
<P>
   When you are ready to cook, heat a thin layer of canola oil in
the skillet. Sprinkle some of the reserved crumbs over the four
fish cakes then lift each up with a spatula and plop into the pan,
crumb side down. Cook over moderate heat until bottom is browned.
Place more crumbs over the top sides of the patties, then with a
spatula flip them upside down into the pan. Continue to cook 3 or 4
minutes, until the patties are browned on the bottom, then serve,
with quarters of lemon on the side for squeezing. This will serve
two.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a New England recipe that is even more popular than one I
spotted for Parker House Codfish Tongues.
</P>
<P>
   Creamed Cod Columbus
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds true cod fillets
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup butter
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup flour
</P>
<P>
   Salt, pepper
</P>
<P>
   2 cups low-fat evaporated milk
</P>
<P>
   1 cup sliced, fresh mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   1 green pepper, seeded and cut in slivers
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup sweet red pepper, seeded and cut in slivers
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon canola oil
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup dry sherry
</P>
<P>
   Cayenne pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Salt, pepper
</P>
<P>
   Melt the butter in a saucepan and stir in the flour. When you
have a smooth paste, slowly add the milk and stir-cook until the
sauce thickens. Hold the sauce over very low heat.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a skillet and saute the pepper slices and
mushrooms for about three 3 minutes. Add the veggies to the sauce
with the sherry plus salt, pepper and cayenne to taste.
</P>
<P>
   Place the cod fillets in a microwaveable dish. Cover with waxed
paper and microwave at full power for about 5 minutes, depending on
the thickness of the fish.
</P>
<P>
   When the fillets can be flaked with a fork, place portions in 4
ramekins or dinner plates. Cover the fish with the warm sauce.
</P>
<P>
   See, you didn't have to get scrod in Boston.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the full House returning for a vote on
impeachment this week, President Clinton on Sunday rebuffed
Republican calls for him to admit to lying under oath and said
flatly that he had not committed perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Looking grim, he deflected suggestions that he should step down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no intention of resigning,'' he said. ``It's never
crossed my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Unable to escape the constitutional crisis engulfing his
presidency, the president fielded questions about his fate side by
side with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in Jerusalem, where he
had flown to try to revive the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Charged with four counts of impeachment for perjury, obstruction
of justice and abuse of power, Clinton said he would not admit to
lying under oath.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not admit to doing something that I am quite sure I
did not do,'' he said. And he took recourse in public opinion polls
to argue that he should be censured, saying ``apparently some
three-quarters of the American people think it's the right thing to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, leading Republicans said his remarks had further
eroded his support and several said he should save the nation from
an impeachment trial by resigning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a way of going out with honor,'' said Rep. Henry
Hyde, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, who appeared
on both ABC's ``This Week'' and CBS' ``Face the Nation'' news
programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would save the country, if he cares about the
country, and I know he does, I think it would save the country a
lot of turmoil and tumult,'' Hyde said. Rep. Tom DeLay, the House
majority whip from Texas, echoed Hyde's appeal for Clinton's
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   The two men spoke a day after the Judiciary Committee ended its
nine-week inquiry by approving, on a party line vote, its fourth
article of impeachment charging Clinton with abuse of power and
calling for him to be removed from the presidency and never allowed
to hold another office.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde showed impatience with calls for Republicans to heed the
message of the mid-term elections and the polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be naive and stupid and probably both, but I just
think a thermometer is not a terribly useful thing on matters of
conscience and matters of principle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 74-year old Illinois Republican said, ``Look, if Jesus
Christ had taken a poll, he would never have preached the gospel.
</P>
<P>
   The House is to formally receive the four articles of
impeachment and an accompanying report from the Judiciary Committee
Wednesday morning. The full House is to begin debating Clinton's
impeachment and removal from office Thursday at 10 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   It will be only the second time in history that the full House
has been called on to consider the impeachment of a president.
Richard Nixon resigned the presidency in the Watergate scandal 24
years ago before a House vote. Andrew Johnson was impeached and
saved from removal from office by one vote after a Senate trial in
1868.
</P>
<P>
   Both DeLay and John Podesta, the White House chief of staff,
called the situation in the House too close to call, with about two
dozen moderate Republicans able to tilt the vote either way.
</P>
<P>
   But the trend appeared to be moving against Clinton. A number of
the Republicans who could make the difference said that the
president had hurt his case with his insistence on Sunday that he
had not perjured himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two simple words, `I lied,' would have gone a long way,'' said
Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., who is accompanying Clinton on his trip to
the Mideast. He spoke on CNN's ``Late Edition.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican, Rep. Bob Ney of Ohio, said, ``I think the
president hurt himself very clearly.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's remarks, however, remained consistent with his defense
before a grand jury last Aug. 17, when he denied that he had lied
in a deposition in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case by saying
he had not had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Underpinning that August testimony was the idea _ repeated by
Clinton's lawyers in their summations before the House Judiciary
Committee last week _ that the president was intentionally trying
to mislead his inquisitors in the Jones case while staying on the
right side of the legal line between not helping his accusers and
perjuring himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, was the testimony in the deposition difficult and
ambiguous  &QL; 
and unhelpful?'' Clinton said on Sunday. ``Yes, it was. That's
exactly what I said in the grand jury testimony, myself.''
</P>
<P>
   While that argument might well serve as a defense in an actual
perjury prosecution, it has infuriated Republicans who charge that
the president has undermined the rule of law. Rep. Scott Klug,
R-Wis., said, on Sunday, ``It's the same thing we've heard: I
didn't, I didn't, I didn't. And I think everybody realizes he
did.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Democrats have been left arguing that the president
deceived the nation, but his lies did not rise to the
constitutional threshold for removing him from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lied to the American people,'' Rep. Dick Gephardt, the
House minority leader, said on the NBC news program ``Meet the
Press.'' ``As bad as that is, I do not think it rises to the level
of impeachment. If he committed a crime of lying under oath _ and
there's a debate by legal scholars on whether or not he actually
perjured himself _ it should be decided in a court of law, in a
criminal proceeding and that will happen after he leaves office if
he is indicted.''
</P>
<P>
   Although House leaders have yet to negotiate how many hours will
be set aside for the debate on impeachment, senior Republicans said
the deliberations could spill over into Friday. The House will take
separate votes on each of the four articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Both Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary, and Gephardt
appealed again on Sunday for Rep. Robert Livingston, the incoming
House speaker, to reverse himself and allow a vote on censure to
come to the floor, as well as the impeachment charges. On Saturday
night, Livingston said censure would violate the separation of
powers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot believe,'' Gephardt said, ``I don't want to bring
myself to believe that the leadership in the House is not going to
allow the members to vote their very deeply held feelings on this
very important issue.''
</P>
<P>
   The Missouri Democrat said Democrats would use a procedural
tactic to try to force the issue, if all else fails. If censure is
not allowed to the floor, more Republicans and even a few more
Democrats than expected might opt for impeachment because they
would have no other way to show their disapproval of the
president's conduct.
</P>
<P>
   If any article of impeachment is approved, Clinton's fate moves
to the Senate for a trial. Unwilling to influence events, the
Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate have said they will
remain silent until after the House acts. A two-thirds vote in the
Senate would be needed to remove Clinton from office.

</P>
<P>
   Both political parties plan caucuses of House members on
Wednesday where members of the Judiciary Committee are likely to
brief members of the lameduck 105th Congress on the legal issues.
</P>
<P>
   The battle for votes is expected to become fierce across the
next few days, although both the White House and Republican leaders
tried to portray themselves on Sunday as not actually lobbying,
while accusing the other side of pressuring House members. And in a
sign of how bitter the fight has become, DeLay on Sunday raised
questions about Clinton's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm suggesting the president of the United States cannot be
believed and I think it's reflective in his foreign policy,'' the
Texas Republican said. ``Saddam Hussein knows it and that's why he
jerks his chain all the time.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright shot back on CNN that any
suggestion Clinton would try to manipulate foreign policy crises
for personal reasons ''undercuts our national security.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has never been well liked in Congress and that fact
seems to becoming back to haunt him now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm prejudiced against him,'' Rep. W.J. Tauzin, R-La., who is
a possible swing vote, admitted on Sunday. ``You see he's lied to
me personally on a very serious matter.'' He was referring to
negotiations over an energy tax in the 1993 budget deal.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans also seem to still be harboring deep feeling
about the Watergate scandal of a quarter of a century ago.
Livingston on Saturday told reporters that Nixon ``faced
impeachment because he covered up a burglary committed by others.''
He asked ``So why was impeachment the remedy for Nixon and not for
Clinton?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would not be calling members of Congress
personally unless they sent word that they wanted to talk to him.
Mostly, the White House and Democrats were trying to make an appeal
to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to make a special plea to the American people to
get engaged and be involved,'' the White House special counsel,
Gregory Craig, said Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Organized labor was also looking at some way to mount an appeal
for censure. Local unions across the country have set up phone
banks in recent days to lobby Republican lawmakers against
impeachment, but internationals and the AFL-CIO have avoided taking
a public position.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to make this a labor versus far-right fight,''
Peggy Taylor, the AFL-CIO's director of legislation, said in an
interview. ``But after watching the hearings, and seeing how
partisan this has become, it seems more and more outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   And members of Congress were finding their constituents weighing
in. Rep. Jim Ramstad, R-Minn., said he is undecided but leaning
toward voting for impeachment on the first article, which charges
the president with lying to a federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday night, as Ramstad rang a bell to raise money for the
Salvation Army in front of a supermarket, he said people came up to
him to argue for and against impeachment. ``I was barraged,''
Ramstad said. ``Everyone has strong feelings.''

   CANTON, Ohio _ On Sunday morning at 7, the sky was still pitch
black and Sam Sliman could see his breath as he unlocked the front
door to the News Depot. He went to fetch the dolly to wheel in the
Sunday newspapers, 310 of them, The Repository of Canton, The Akron
Beacon-Journal, The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and The New York Times,
every one with the same basic lead headline screaming: House Votes
Next on Impeachment!
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what's funny,'' said Sliman, a registered Republican
who thinks that the House should impeach the president but that he
should not be removed from office. ``I went to two Christmas
parties last night and no one was talking about impeachment. They
talked about whether the Indians should go after Roger Clemens,
they talked about Kevin Brown's $100 million contract with the
Dodgers.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not that they don't know or don't have opinions. In fact,
in conversations with several dozen customers who had come downtown
to pick up their Sunday papers it is striking how much people do
know about impeachment's fine points.
</P>
<P>
   As Stephen Goldberger, a businessman and registered Republican
opposed to impeachment says, ``If you read 5 per cent of what's
written, you know 100 per cent of what you need.'' It's more that
the whole process has taken on a life of its own and seems surreal,
far away, out of their hands, scripted and beyond their control.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got a certain momentum all its own,'' says John Gray, a
plant manager and Democrat opposed to impeachment. ``I feel like
we're all standing here watching this snowball roll downhill.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Ralph Regula, the local Republican congressman, a moderate
who still has not announced his position on impeachment, has been
surprised by how few calls he has personally received. When Tom
Hannon, a state Republican leader and strong advocate for
impeachment, came in to pick up his papers after 8 a.m. mass at St.
John's, he was asked whether he had phoned Regula. ``You know I
haven't,'' he said, ``and I should.''
</P>
<P>
   Canton and surrounding Stark County is a political bellwether, a
Northeast Ohio community that has consistently in the last several
elections voted as the nation did for president, supporting the
Republicans in the 1980s and swinging to President Clinton in the
1990s. For this reason, The Times did a series of stories here in
1996, when Stark voted for Clinton by an 8 per cent margin _
precisely his national margin of victory.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton still seems to have considerable support here, at
least among people picking up their Sunday papers at the News
Depot, that support does not appear as strong as it was during a
visit here in late September. Although it is still easier to find
Republicans opposing impeachment than Democrats supporting it, on
this visit, opinions seemed more closely divided along partisan
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Says Sliman, who knows the political leanings of almost all his
customers, ``As soon as they walk in, I can tell you what they'll
say about impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good morning, Red,'' said Sliman. ``How you doing, big guy?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not bad for a poor boy,'' said Jack ``Red'' Mayle, a retired
union steelworker. Asked his view on impeachment, Mayle said,
``It's wrong. I'm an African-American and I recognize a lynch mob
when I see it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand Peter Voss, a retired chief executive officer
of an engineering company who votes Republican, favored removing
Clinton, saying it was strong medicine, but in the long run the
country would be healthier for it. ``This would be a definite
signal to other officeholders that character does matter,'' he
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Roy Gutierrez, the former chairman of the Stark Democratic party
who picked up a copy of the Plain-Dealer and fellow Democrat Bob
Horowitz, the county prosecutor, getting his copy of the
Beacon-Journal, supported the president, while Donna Shaheen, a
retired office worker from Black McCuskey, one of the big corporate
law firms in town, favored impeachment. ``He lied,'' said Ms.
Shaheen, a Republican voter. ``If I had done what he did, I'd be in
jail right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard DeVaux, a private investigator, was one of the few
Democrats interviewed who wanted the president out. ``He should be
hung,'' said DeVaux. ``The idea that this is some woman thing is
bull_ he lied under oath.''
</P>
<P>
   But Jim Lockshin, a Republican-leaning businessman who has been
coming into the News Depot for ``40 or 50 years,'' opposed
impeachment, as did Les Walker, another Republican voter stopping
by for his paper after the 8:30 service at Christ Presbyterian
Church.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did lie,'' said Walker, ``but they were asking him very
private questions that most people would not admit to. If I was in
that position, I think I'd be evasive, too. It doesn't seem of any
danger to the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Rachel Schneider, a retired university instructor who votes
Republican thinks he should be impeached, and face trial in the
Senate, but is not sure there is enough evidence yet to merit
removal. Still, she's hopeful they'll get him. ``I keep hoping
they'll get some information out of Susan McDougal and Web
Hubbell,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   M.L. Schultze, the managing editor of The Repository, and her
husband Rick Senften, the city editor, made their usual stop for
three Sunday papers, after attending services at St. Paul's
Episcopal Church. ``They had a special healing service this
morning,'' said Ms. Schultze. ``There was a laying on of hands.
Some asked for their arthritis to be healed, others asked for
healing of the anger and fear that is going on in the nation now.''
</P>
<P>
   While The Repository _ which endorsed Clinton twice _ was one of
the first papers in the nation to call for his resignation, in
recent weeks, says Ms. Schultze, its editorial stance has been less
sure and Sunday's editorial was more neutral, acknowledging that
the president had ``managed to maintain a leadership position much
to the regret of his opponents and our surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   The Plain-Dealer took a less generous view in an editorial
headlined ``Impeach Him.'' ``Failure to impeach would even permit
him to claim exoneration despite his obvious mendacity,'' said the
paper, adding, ``Clinton trampled on the responsibilities of the
presidency with self-centered disregard.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Sliman felt that whatever the president's fate,
the country would remain strong. Sliman left at 10 to go to mass at
St. Peter's, saying he'd be back at 1 to close, and he was, right
on the dot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should I shut off the electricity?'' David Minor, a clerk,
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll do it Dave; you can go,'' said Sliman. He removed the
receipt tape from the register and turned off the power to the
front display windows, stopping Santa's and Rudolph's heads from
bobbing.
</P>
<P>
   There was still a big stack of Sunday papers left. ``People will
pick them up on Monday when they come downtown to work,'' Sliman
explained. One of the reasons for choosing to live in a place like
Canton is that it isn't the worst thing in the world if you read
Sunday's news a day or two late.
</P>
<P>
   Sliman was looking forward to Sunday dinner. His wife was
cooking pork chops and mashed potatoes and at 4 p.m. they were
going to his son T.J.'s basketball game. ``Things that really
matter,'' said Sliman, turning off the lights.

SCANDALS COOL JAPAN'S DEMOCRATIC PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ What has happened to Japan's Democratic Party?
</P>
<P>
   Just two months ago, the country's largest opposition party and
its dynamic leader, Naoto Kan, were ascendant.
</P>
<P>
   Voters handed them the ability to control the upper house of
Parliament in June, and they united with other parties to thwart
the governing party on several fronts.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, Kan and his Democrats have been flattened by
scandals, dithering and internal dissension. Some opposition
partners have abandoned them and made deals with the governing
Liberal Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   And just last month, Ichiro Ozawa and his Liberal Party turned
from friend to foe, signing a tentative agreement to form a
coalition with the governing party that will greatly frustrate the
Democratic Party's ability to hold legislation hostage to its
demands, its most potent weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Popular support for the Democratic Party is on the decline _
they have no clear strategy and there's the whiff of scandal about
them,'' said Takeshi Sasaki, a political science professor at Tokyo
University.
</P>
<P>
   Even Yukio Hatoyama, Kan's deputy, is feeling glum. ``We pushed
too hard right after the election,'' he said in an interview.
``There are a lot of things for which we owe hansei'' _ a word that
can mean reflection, contrition or self-examination.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed his party for stealing too much of the thunder when
the opposition successfully forced Democratic plans for fixing the
banking system into law in September, the first time legislation
has been crafted by legislators rather than bureaucrats. He said
the party should have shared credit with its partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pushed the Liberal Party from us toward the LDP,'' Hatoyama
said. ``We rejoiced too much when we were successful in getting the
banking law passed.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrite as he may be, Hatoyama is confident that if a general
election were called today, his party would score big. He
calculates that the Democrats would win 170 seats in the powerful
500-seat lower house, an estimate the governing party does not
dispute, and Komeito, the second-largest opposition group, would
probably win 50. That is not enough to secure a majority, but it
would probably rob the governing party of its grip on the powerful
Lower House.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democratic Party has so far fielded candidates for fewer
than half the seats that Hatoyama expects to win, and general
elections must be held by October 2000, although most expect them
next year.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the party's most prominent representative, Kan, is
mired in a sex scandal that threatens to shake his bedrock support
among women. He began his political career by managing the
parliamentary campaign of one of Japan's leading feminists.
</P>
<P>
   But a conservative weekly magazine has asserted that Kan spent
the night in a hotel room with a former television anchor, a woman
20 years his junior who has been a consultant to the Democratic
Party. Kan denied the story, but in an extensive interview
published recently, he conceded that his actions could have been
misconstrued.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal is being blamed for a significant drop in the
Democrats' popularity. A recent poll taken by the Kyodo News
Service showed support for Kan's party at 16.8 percent of the 1,911
respondents, a drop of 6 percentage points since September. The
governing party gained the favor of those the Democrats lost, with
its support level rising 6.1 percentage points, to 32.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The sex scandal followed news reports asserting that Kan had
accepted a $4.2 million payoff from Hiromu Nonaka, the powerful
chief Cabinet secretary and a senior member of the governing party,
to guarantee the passage of legislation to overhaul the banking
system.
</P>
<P>
   Kan has also denied that accusation, and Hatoyama said both
scandals were cooked up by Liberal Democrats frightened by the
prospect of an opposition party with real teeth. Traditionally,
Japanese opposition parties have been little more than opposition
voices, offering little in the way of alternative policies.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democrats do offer distinctly different views on
national security, electoral reform and fiscal policy, giving
voters a clear choice.
</P>
<P>
   Many suspect that there are divisions within the party about how
vigorously those policies should be pursued. Kan was reportedly
angry with Hatoyama for refusing to yield on banking reform,
arguing that the hard-line stance would give the governing party
the opportunity to blame the Democrats for holding up legislation
while the world was pressing Japan to move quickly.

KILLING OF 3 REBEL WRITERS TURNS HOPE TO FEAR IN IRAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By DOUGLAS JEHL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHERAN, Iran _ Three dissident Iranian writers have been
reported missing in the last month, and now all three have turned
up dead. An opposition leader and his wife have been killed,
stabbed to death in their Tehran home.
</P>
<P>
   Not since the revolution nearly 20 years ago has Iran witnessed
such eerie, unexplained violence. And more than at any time since
the election of President Mohammad Khatami, hopes that Iran might
be moving toward a more tolerant new day are giving way to fears of
darker times ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I, too, may disappear soon,'' said Firouz Gouran, whose
magazine, The Healthy Society, has been banned by a government
edict.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 writers, poets and other secular intellectuals
joined Gouran during the weekend for what was part protest and part
wake, but the mood here is so unsettled that none dared to make the
trip alone. In an open letter to Khatami that was drafted during
the session, the intellectuals appealed for government protection.
</P>
<P>
   ``We writers wish to call on the chief executive, who is in
charge of ensuring the safety of all citizens, to end this horrible
situation by any means,'' they said.
</P>
<P>
   The body of the latest victim, Mohammad Jafar Pouyandeh, a
writer last seen on Dec. 9, was identified by his relatives on
Saturday. Family members said his body showed signs of
strangulation. The dissident poet Mohammad Mokhtari, whose body was
found last week, was also reported to have been strangled.
</P>
<P>
   The body of another dissident writer, Javad Sharif, was found
earlier this month in what friends have said were suspicious
circumstances. The opposition figures, Dariush Forouhar and his
wife, Parvaneh, had been killed in a gruesome fashion several hours
before their bodies were discovered on Nov. 21.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks have outraged many people in Iran, and they have
prompted calls from Western literary societies, human rights groups
and the State Department for swift government action.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami has condemned the killings in strong terms and vowed to
seek the arrest of those responsible. So far, though, the main
effect of the killings has been to expose Khatami's relative
impotence.
</P>
<P>
   Within Iran's fractious power structure, Khatami commands little
authority over the security and intelligence forces. They are more
closely aligned with the country's more conservative supreme
leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
   From the two ends of Iran's political spectrum, competing
theories have been offered as to who may be responsible for the
killings. The conservative-led judiciary, in a statement Sunday,
blamed a ``mysterious and organized move inspired by foreign
elements.'' But at the other end of the spectrum, some dissidents
have alleged involvement by the Iranian Intelligence Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever was responsible, Khatami's admirers worry that
undermining the president may be exactly what the killings are
intended to do. In the struggle that has raged in Iran since
Khatami's landslide 1997 election victory, they fear, the attacks
may represent a new phase of a battle over the extent to which Iran
should embrace political and cultural openness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are sure that they want to close the society as before,''
Gholam-Abbas Tavassoli, a leading member of the Freedom Movement,
said of what he believed was the prime motive behind the killings.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview published in the Iranian newspaper Zan, one of
Khatami's lieutenants, Deputy Interior Minister Mostafa Tajzadeh,
described the potential threat to Khatami's agenda in even starker
terms. ``Anarchy will make society thirsty for security, and people
will pay any price to get that security, even if they lose their
legitimate rights and freedom,'' Tajzadeh said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Khatami took office, voices critical of Iran's ruling
religious establishment have generally sought a higher profile, but
as with the quest for greater openness as a whole, their efforts
have met with no more than mixed success. In general, the path has
zigzagged between advances and setbacks: New newspapers have
flourished, censorship has been relaxed and voices of dissent have
found greater tolerance. But each of these gains has been
periodically eroded _ and sometimes sharply _ by the
conservative-led judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   Long before the killings began last month, for example, clear
warnings were sent to government critics _ including the detention
of Ibrahim Yazdi, leader of a liberal Islamic group, for 11 days
last December; the closing of several newspapers, most notably
Jameah and its successor, Tous, the boldest of the new voices, and
the jailing of editors, including Mahmoud Shamsvolazein of Tous,
who spent 35 days in a prison outside Tehran this fall.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, Khatami has generally been seen until now as doing all he
can to promote freedom in the face of considerable obstacles.
</P>
<P>
   That perception has been reflected in a change of vocabulary;
since Khatami's election, the word ``government'' has been used
more narrowly, to refer specifically to the executive branch. To
refer more broadly to the clerical establishment _ including the
leadership headed by Ayatollah Khamenei, the judiciary and
parliament, all seen as rivals to Khatami _ Iranians now use the
words ``system'' or ``regime.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the killings continue, Khatami's supporters fear, the
distinction could be eroded _ not only in the minds of ordinary
Iranians but in the eyes of foreign governments, whose good will
Iran needs to overcome its financial troubles.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the National Security Council, over which Khatami
presides, held an emergency meeting to discuss the killings. And in
a statement published in Iranian newspapers Sunday, the Ministry of
Culture and Islamic Guidance denounced the killings as ``inhuman
acts, whatever the intentions or aims of the perpetrators may have
been.''
</P>
<P>
   The ministry said of those responsible, ``Their only objective
was to disappoint the people, undermine the system and strike a
blow at the fresh and positive atmosphere that has until recently
prevailed in the Islamic Republic of Iran.''

BILLS AIM FOR PLAYOFFS BUT MANY OF THEIR FANS STAY HOME 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. _ After they thrashed the Oakland Raiders by
44-21 Sunday, a few Buffalo Bills looked over their shoulders while
walking off the field. They saw the big television screen over the
end zone showing a live scene from the final minute of the game
between Tennessee and Jacksonville.
</P>
<P>
   With the score tied, the Oilers lined up for a field goal. A
Tennessee loss would have clinched at least a wild-card playoff
berth for Buffalo. But the Oilers made the field goal and won their
game, leaving the 9-5 Bills still one small step from post-season
play. Did this take the edge off Buffalo's most convincing victory
of the season? Not at all, said Doug Flutie, the nimble
quarterback, who threw for two more touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our view of that is shooting higher,'' Flutie said after
completing 17 of 26 passes for 184 yards. After reciting a few
tie-breaker calculations, Flutie made it clear that he still thinks
his Bills can finish first in the American Football Conference East
and gain a bye in the first round of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   To do that, they will need to beat the Jets next Saturday in
their rematch here.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we can take care of is the Jets now,'' Flutie said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bills have taken care of almost everyone else. Except for a
defeat two weeks ago at New England, a verdict they felt was stolen
from them by officiating mistakes, the Bills have not lost since
the Jets beat them on Nov. 8. After opening the season with three
losses, the Bills are 9-2 in their last 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   One of Sunday's primary contributors was Antowain Smith, a
second-year running back, who scored one touchdown, led the team in
rushing with 77 yards on 22 carries and crossed the 1,000-yard mark
for the first time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   When asked whether the Bills are peaking at the right time,
Smith replied: ``Oh, yeah, no doubt. We are coming together,
heading into the end of the stretch. Our main goal is to make the
playoffs. Once we make the playoffs, we want to continue to keep
moving forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, Smith said, ``beat us rather handily'' in the first
meeting, by 34-12. ``This time around, it's going to be a different
game,'' he said. ``We are going to be fired up.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they might also get their fans fired up. Sunday's crowd
of 62,002 was more than 18,000 short of capacity on a sunny
afternoon with temperatures in the mid-40s and mild winds. As of
late last week, the Bills had more than 20,000 tickets available
for the Jets game. Only three of seven games have been on home
television this season.
</P>
<P>
   A recent drive to market luxury seating concluded with $11
million in sales and the promise of a $63 million public finance
package to renovate Rich Stadium. In exchange, owner Ralph Wilson
promised to keep the Bills here for five more seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The public here in western New York is not entirely supportive.
In a letter to The Buffalo News today, one writer suggested
sarcastically that politicians kick in $50,000 more to pay the
fines assessed against Wilson for criticizing the officials in the
New England game. Another correspondent suggested that Wilson's
next ultimatum might be to demand that fans buy 40,000 hot dogs
every game.
</P>
<P>
   Some fans at the game saved their venom for the officiating
crew. A bedsheet banner said, ``Blow the whistle, not the call!''
But this one was never close enough for controversial decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Under Wade Wilson, the third-string quarterback, the Raiders'
offense gave up two touchdowns to the Bills' defense. One was a
13-yard rumble with a fumble by defensive end Phil Hanson after
Wilson was sacked by Bruce Smith. Another was an interception of a
Wilson pass by linebacker Gabe Northern, who ran it back 40 yards
for a touchdown to make the score 44-14 in the fourth period.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, when Northern was kicked out of the game
for kicking a Raider, he ran off the field to the happy howls of
those fans who were not participating in or watching several
disruptions in the seats.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland lost its fourth consecutive game and its fifth in its
last six, falling from playoff contention. Appropriately for the
weekend on which the Heisman Trophy was awarded, two Raiders
touchdowns were scored by former Heisman winners, Desmond Howard
and Tim Brown. But the most effective Heisman honoree was Flutie,
who stands 5 feet 10 inches and 175 pounds, and whose critics once
joked that he was barely bigger than the statue.
</P>
<P>
   Smiling, Flutie shrugged off a question about the Pro Bowl
voting scheduled for Monday. A year ago, he was playing in Canada
for the Grey Cup. A few weeks ago he began to fill cereal bowls
with Flutie Flakes, a breakfast food that finances a foundation for
autistic children. For Flutie, any other honor or bowl this season
would be just super.

GIANTS UPSET BRONCOS AND PRESERVE DOLPHINS' LEGACY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ For weeks, on the practice field, on the
team bus and in the hallway between team meetings, Giants wide
receiver Amani Toomer would sneak up behind quarterback Kent
Graham.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throw me the ball,'' Toomer would say. ``I'll make you
famous.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday afternoon, 57 seconds remained in the game between the
Giants and a Denver team chasing history when Graham looked across
the huddle at Toomer and called this play: ``A2, double seam.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Toomer's time, his wish no longer a whisper in a hallway.
Seconds later, with the Giants trailing by 16-13, a Graham pass was
spiraling toward Toomer in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball was in the air and looked really big,'' he later
said. ``It looked like the Hindenburg. I knew I was going to catch
it.''
</P>
<P>
   An acrobatic catch left Toomer lying in the back of the end zone
with a 37-yard touchdown pass, and 48 fitful seconds later, the
Broncos' undefeated season was no longer. A 20-16 Giants victory
three weeks from the end of the regular season had preserved the
singular achievement of the 1972 Miami Dolphins, the National
Football League's only team to go unbeaten in both the regular
season and post-season.
</P>
<P>
   A dreary Giants season suddenly had a flashy moment of
significance, a game that is among the biggest upsets in the
history of the league's regular season. On the anniversary of last
year's division title-clinching victory over the Washington
Redskins, Giants Stadium was again the scene of wild celebration on
the field and in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team will be remembered for this game,'' Coach Jim Fassel
said of his Giants, who have a 6-8 record, and remarkably, are one
game behind Tampa Bay and Arizona in the chase for a wild-card
playoff berth. ``Not for all the other things that have gone on
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Graham: ``This is what dreams are made of.''
</P>
<P>
   And Toomer, who has been used sparingly for most of three Giants
seasons, felt all his jabbering at Graham had paid off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hound Kent every day,'' he said with a wide smile. ``And I
was right.''
</P>
<P>
   If Graham is not famous, as Toomer predicted, at least he has a
charming story to entertain his grandchildren. It will be a tale
about the day Graham, a career back-up leading a losing team,
outplayed John Elway, a future Hall of Famer who was guiding a team
that had not lost in 13 games this season.
</P>
<P>
   Graham completed 21 of 33 passes for 265 yards and two
touchdowns and did not throw an interception. Elway completed 19 of
36 passes for 180 yards, with no touchdown passes and one
interception. In five games at Giants Stadium, Elway has a 1-4
record, with three touchdown passes and five interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazing, unbelievable, fantastic,'' said Graham, whose
starting job was in jeopardy entering Sunday's game. ``It was all
of those things.''
</P>
<P>
   For the defending Super Bowl champion Broncos, it was a sobering
game of surprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad and it hurts because I think we thought right to the
end that we'd pull it out,'' said Denver running back Terrell
Davis. ``You go so long without losing, you start to think you'll
pull them all out. No one on our team believed we'd lose until time
ran out, and then it became very real.''
</P>
<P>
   The game ended with the Broncos at the Giants' 30-yard line, and
with Elway heaving a final desperation pass at the end zone that
was batted down by the Giants' Percy Ellsworth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like going for a basketball rebound,'' said Ellsworth,
a former high school basketball All-American. ``You've got to take
it away from the other team.''
</P>
<P>
   As Ellsworth spoke, he stood next to a bulletin board that
contained the message ``Shock the World.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants had delivered this shock to the football community
with a swarming defense that for one of the few times this season
resembled the unit that led the 1997 Giants to a division title.
The Giants sacked Elway three times and did not allow Denver a
touchdown until the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   An ingenious maneuver _ using the rookie safety Shaun Williams
as the replacement for the injured nickel linebacker Scott Galyon _
proved fruitful.
</P>
<P>
   Williams made a pivotal interception of Elway and was a key
reason the Giants were able to limit Denver's All-Pro tight end
Shannon Sharpe to 4 catches and just 25 passing yards.
</P>
<P>
   On offense, the Giants looked unusually fluid and confident.
running their plays crisply and blocking with authority. Graham was
sacked just once, and that was because his receivers were covered.
</P>
<P>
   Giants running back Gary Brown ran for 112 yards on only 18
carries, averaging 6.2 yards a attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of good defense and an effective offense kept
the Giants in the game early, even though the Broncos were moving
the football and led by 6-3 late in the second quarter. But with 51
seconds left in the half, Graham connected with running back Tiki
Barber, who caught Graham's pass in the left flat and ran untouched
into the end zone for a 21-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Barber's score was the last play in a 15-play, 80-yard drive
that was one of the Giants' best possessions of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' lead was cut to 10-9 with a third-quarter Denver
field goal, but Williams' interception in the fourth quarter set in
motion another Giant drive, fueled by a 45-yard run by Brown, to
the Broncos' 1-yard line. From there, Brown was stopped in his
third-down attempt to score running up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel made the safe decision on fourth down, sending in Brad
Daluiso to kick a 19-yard field goal for a 13-9 lead. It was an
unpopular choice inside Giants Stadium at the time, and a
potentially controversial one when the Broncos regained the lead on
a 27-yard touchdown run by Davis on Denver's next possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way our defense was playing,'' Fassel said. ``I thought
the field goal made sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel spent less time defending his decision to kick the field
goal because of the game-winning Graham-to-Toomer touchdown pass.
But before that strike, there were more tense moments for the
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Brown had not fumbled the football since the end of the 1993
season _ or 807 consecutive touches of the ball _ but he fumbled
his final carry of Sunday's game with 3:36 left.
</P>
<P>
   But the Giants' defense forced another Denver punt, one which
rolled past Toomer and had Graham beginning the Giants' final drive
at his 14-yard line with 1:49 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   In the huddle, wide receiver Chris Calloway _ who may be the
quietest Giant off the field _ shouted to his teammates: ``We're
going to win this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Calloway then caught a 15-yard pass from Graham. On the next
play, Graham scrambled up the middle for 23 yards.
</P>
<P>
   On a third-and-10, Graham completed an 11-yard pass to the
rookie Joe Jurevicius, who went out of bounds at the Denver 37.
</P>
<P>
   On the next play, even though the Giants were almost in range to
attempt a game-tying field goal, Graham went deep to Toomer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said: `We've got to go after them right here,' '' Graham
said.
</P>
<P>
   Toomer ran to his position at the far right edge of the Giants'
formation. The Giants had four receivers split wide and the Broncos
defenders were mostly bunched to the left, away from Toomer.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I saw they had man-to-man coverage on my side,''
Toomer said. ``I knew they were in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   He knew, as he had predicted, that he, and Graham, might be
famous. &QL;

EDITORIAL: THOSE MISSING MAGIC WORDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Dec. 14: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to duty and self-preservation, there is no
question as to what the content of President Clinton's next speech
should be. The question is whether Clinton will have the strength
and wisdom to deliver it in the days before the House of
Representatives votes to impeach him. The 20 or so Republican
moderates who will decide that vote want to hear the president say
that he lied under oath, in those words. But when he spoke Sunday,
Clinton did not come close to saying the magic words. He has time
to speak them between now and the House vote on Thursday. We hope
that he will, but the odd passivity of the president and his legal
team provides little foundation for such a hope.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his advisers have yet to understand that petulance
is not a strategy, even when the opposition is behaving with
partisan malice and distorting the Constitution. Robert Livingston,
the designated speaker, pondered for days about whether to lead the
House toward an honorable compromise around a censure resolution.
But he backed down rather than face his tough-guy whip, Tom DeLay.
If a future speaker cannot defy ``The Hammer,'' as DeLay likes to
be known, imagine how hard it is for Republican moderates on the
back benches. That is why they were on the Sunday talk shows
imploring Clinton to offer the concession that would provide the
political cover for a vote against impeachment. As Rep. Scott Klug
of Wisconsin said on ``Meet the Press,'' there will be no leniency
from this political court unless it hears ``an admission of guilt
from the president.''
</P>
<P>
   That admission would not be necessary if the House vote was
conducted strictly on constitutional principle. As Lloyd Cutler, a
Clinton defender, said on ABC, this president's ``low crimes'' do
not meet the constitutional standard for impeachment. But politics
and human nature enter into this matter as well. Clinton did lie
repeatedly, in plain sight, while under oath. In the language of
Lawyer World, where Clinton seems to live, it might be possible to
label such behavior as ``ambiguous'' and get away with it. But in
the world of political reality, there has never been a Congress,
Democratic or Republican, that would be willing to extend mercy and
at the same time sign up as historic endorsers of multiple,
bald-faced lies.
</P>
<P>
   By refusing to bargain with the House, Clinton seems to be
betting that the Senate will not remove him. It could, in fact,
impose the kind of censure that Livingston is refusing to allow the
House to consider. But whatever happens in Congress, Clinton's
defiance and his willingness to gamble on a Senate showdown look a
lot like the behavior that got him into this mess _ irresponsible,
self-destructive and dangerously out of place in the Oval Office.

COMMENTARY: ACROSS THE RIVER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At a diet breakfast in New York last week with
Israeli Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, I asked why Yasser Arafat
had been acting so confidently and provocatively lately.
</P>
<P>
   Since October's Wye accords, and following the anger on the
Israeli right about Prime Minister Netanyahu's West Bank
withdrawals, the Palestinians have:
</P>
<P>
   (1) escalated their warnings about a unilateral declaration of
statehood by May 4, which would scuttle negotiations begun in Oslo,
Norway;
</P>
<P>
   (2) incited riots with complaints that Israel was releasing from
jail _ supposedly against the Wye agreement _ ordinary Palestinian
criminals, not inmates with what Sharon calls ``blood on their
hands'';
</P>
<P>
   (3) and fuzzified their pledge to revoke Israel-must-die
provisions of the Palestinian ``covenant,'' hinting that a vote of
the leadership rather than the full membership was all that was
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon's response about Arafat's attitude was curious: ``He's
looking across the river.'' Pressed to explain, the white-haired
``last of Israel's founding generals'' focused instead on what
Clinton could do during his visit to Israel and Gaza to get the
Palestinians back on track.
</P>
<P>
   We will see on Monday night one specific fruit of President
Clinton's visit: Most members of the Palestinian National Council,
as a gesture of gratitude to the U.S. president for bolstering
their sense of statehood, will raise their hands to remove the
offensive language from their organizing document. This will be a
Clinton achievement, reassuring Jews to whom such writings have
meaning, and he deserves full credit for it.
</P>
<P>
   On the Palestinian incitement to violence based on the prisoner
release: It will be a test of Clinton's mediating credibility for
him to step up to that unequivocally in Gaza. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright has already noted that Israel was keeping its
Wye promise on prisoners; if Clinton bears witness on that
pacifying point in his Gaza speech, it may dampen violence planned
for after his departure.
</P>
<P>
   But what of the Palestinians' May 4 ``deadline'' for a final
agreement or else? That word carries worrisome overtones and
Israelis do not react well to ultimatums. Will Clinton lean on
Arafat not just to cool it for a week or so but to publicly drop
that threat, as Sharon urged in the Oval Office last week? Will
Clinton choose to be eyeless in Gaza, or will he see the need to
make plain to all Palestinians that such gun-to-the-head
negotiating undermines the cause of peace?
</P>
<P>
   This is a proper moment for Clinton to be in the Middle East.
Set wag-the-dove cynicism aside; if his trip can show Arafat that
America supports genuine land-for-peace reciprocity, the nation is
better served than with the president holed up in the White House
talking to paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's Labor opposition must decide soon whether it will try
to save or scuttle the ``process.'' If it chooses to join the
discontented far right, it might bring down Netanyahu's government
_ but would end all negotiations for six months. In a campaign,
both major parties would surely seek to ``out-security'' the other.
In making peace afterward, a victorious right could ultimately
deliver the soft-line left, but it doesn't work the other way
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arik,'' of all people, is becoming the most unifying force in
Israel. He actively seeks a unity government with Labor; if that
doesn't fly, he eyes a coalition with a potential amalgam of the
Likud left and Labor right. (Impossible? Look, if the House can
impeach Bill, Bibi can embrace Dan Meridor.)
</P>
<P>
   But what drives Arik to alienate far-right followers and reach
across political lines? He says he sees the urgency to create a
climate that will draw another million Russian Jews to Israel,
helping secure the state demographically.
</P>
<P>
   Now let me guess what he meant by ``looking across the river.''
If Arafat gets a state with the borders he demands, he will then
look across the Jordan River. King Hussein is gravely ill; his
Hashemite clan is outnumbered by Palestinians. Jordan and Palestine
might soon ``federate,'' but under Palestinian leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan borders on Iraq. With the formation of Greater Palestine,
a truck could start out in Baghdad and roll unvexed to within a
mortar's range of Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder most Israelis want to keep a protective territorial
presence within the West Bank of the Jordan River.

EDITORIAL: DISSENT AND DEATH IN IRAN 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Dec. 14:
</P>
<P>
   Political murder has returned to Iran, with liberal
intellectuals the target and conservative religious forces a
possible sponsor. Several prominent critics of clerical repression
have been killed in the last month. The body of the latest victim,
Mohammad Jafar Pouyandeh, was identified by his family over the
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   President Mohammad Khatami, who has condemned the recent
killings, is trying to ease Iran's isolation by demonstrating that
its revolution no longer countenances terrorism. But his efforts
will succeed only if he can overcome those who would drag Iran back
to the bloodshed and intolerance of the years following its 1979
revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The two latest victims of terror, Pouyandeh and Mohammad
Mokhtari, appear to have been targeted because they tried to revive
a writers union and campaigned against clerical censorship. In
October, both were questioned by an Islamic revolutionary court
about these efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier killings involved Javad Sharif, a returned exile, and
Dariush Forouhar, a veteran secular politician and human rights
advocate who was stabbed to death along with his wife, Parvaneh.
Last month a bus carrying American businessmen was attacked by a
group that opposes Khatami's policy of encouraging private ties
between Iran and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Though Khatami is Iran's top elected leader, he is outranked by
the country's conservative spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei. Khamenei and his supporters are uncomfortable with
Khatami's efforts to encourage freer political and cultural
expression. They have used their power in the courts to close
newspapers and harass dissidents. Now some extremists may be going
further by using assassination to silence critics.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has been right to respond positively
to Khatami's cautious diplomatic overtures. But in the face of
clerical resistance and Iran's growing economic problems, it is
still not clear if Khatami's moderate domestic and foreign policies
will prevail. A return to revolutionary terror in Iran bodes poorly
for ending the chill between Tehran and Washington, even though a
continued thaw would serve the best interests of both countries.

CLINTON LAUNCHES EFFORT TO SAVE MIDEAST PEACE PACT

JERUSALEM _ President Clinton called on Israelis and Palestinians
Sunday to stop provocative actions and adhere to the Wye River pact
if peace is to come to the troubled region.
</P>
<P>
   But Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, during a
strikingly negative assessment of Palestinian compliance, demanded
that Yasser Arafat renounce his intentions to declare a Palestinian
state next year or Israel will halt further land concessions.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton launched a three-day effort to salvage the Wye River
Memorandum that called on Israel to withdraw troops from portions
of the West Bank in return for security guarantees from the
Palestinian Authority. The United States is still trying to arrange
a three-way meeting among Clinton, Netanyahu and Arafat to revive
the faltering accord.
</P>
<P>
   The provisions of the pact have been frozen as both sides,
facing internal political opposition, increased the rhetoric.
Palestinian youths repeatedly have clashed with Israeli soldiers
over the issue of prisoner releases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each side has serious political constraints; I think we all
understand that. Provocative pronouncements, unilateral actions can
be counterproductive, given the constraints that each side has,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in the end, there has been a fundamental decision made to
deal with this through honest discussion and negotiation. That is
the only way it can be done,'' Clinton added. ``It cannot be done
by resorting to other means when times get difficult. And again, I
say the promise of Wye cannot be fulfilled by violence or by
statements or actions that are inconsistent with the whole peace
process. Both sides should adhere to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spent two hours behind closed doors with Netanyahu and
his delegation as they made their assessment of the Wye River
accord. Today, Clinton will do the same with Arafat during an
unprecedented visit to the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Netanyahu accused the Palestinians of doing nothing
to comply with the terms of the Wye River pact and offered a harsh
assessment of the accord so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret to say that none of these conditions have been met,''
Netanyahu said at a brief news conference with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister criticized the Palestinians for Arafat's
comments that they will declare a state on May 4 and make eastern
Jerusalem the Palestinian capital. He called the act a ``gross
violation'' of a previous agreement to settle such issues as
statehood during final status talks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Arafat and the Palestinian Authority must officially and
unequivocally renounce this attempt. I think no one can seriously
expect Israel to hand over another inch of territory unless and
until such an unambiguous correction is made,'' Netanyahu said.
</P>
<P>
   The second phase of Israeli troop redeployment is scheduled for
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu also accused the Palestinians of inciting violence and
accused the Palestinian Authority of downgrading its security
cooperation with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   He also was dismissive of the Palestinian National Council
session scheduled today in which it will affirm removal of charter
provisions calling for Israel's destruction. Clinton is to observe
the vote and speak to the council.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that today (Monday) the Palestinian Authority will
once and for all live up to at least one of their obligations,''
said Netanyahu, who was referring to the vote.
</P>
<P>
   An administration official said that the United States does not
share Netanyahu's views on Palestinian compliance and that both
sides complied with the first phase of the Wye accord.
</P>
<P>
   During the first phase, Israel withdrew its troops from 2
percent of the 13.1 percent of the West Bank that it agreed to turn
over to Palestinian control. The Palestinian Authority in turn took
steps to crack down on security as a step toward combating
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said that renunciation of
the statehood declaration was not a condition in the Wye accord.
However,she also said that ``unilateral actions and unilateral
statements generally are not helpful to the atmosphere of having
the Wye process go forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The main issue that must be dealt with is the question of
violence, Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive issues, such as prisoner releases, need ``to be
resolved at the table and not out in the streets,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech broadcast throughout the nation, Clinton later spoke
to 3,000 Israeli young people and reaffirmed the U.S. commitment to
Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the Wye River Memorandum, Clinton agreed to come to
the Middle East to speak on the peace plans to both Israelis and
Palestinians. He called on the youths to consider what future they
wanted and suggested that peace was the only alternative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, there have been setbacks; more misunderstandings,
more disagreements, more provocations, more acts of violence,'' the
president said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel Palestinians should prove in word and deed that their
intentions have actually changed, as you redeploy from land on
which tears and blood have been shed, and you are right to feel
that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Palestinians feel you should acknowledge they too have
suffered and they too have legitimate expectations that should be
met and, like Israel, internal political pressure that must be
overcome. And they are right, too,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton visited
to the gravesite of former Prime Minister Yatzhak Rabin, who was
assassinated in 1995 by a Jewish extremist opposed to the peace
plan.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton placed a smooth oval stone from the Wye River on Rabin's
tomb. Leah Rabin, the prime minister's widow and Hillary Clinton
placed flowers on the grave.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also lit a candle for the first night of Hannukah, the
Jewish festival of light, which began Sunday night.

CLINTON HAS `NO INTENTION' OF RESIGNING
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
By NANCY MATHIS &QL; 
and DAVID IVANOVICH &QL;
</P>
<P>
   c. 1998
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
JERUSALEM _ A grim-faced President Clinton said Sunday that he has
``no intention of resigning'' as the House prepares this week to
debate four articles of impeachment lodged against him.
</P>
<P>
   The president's adamant refusal to consider stepping down came
as the head of the House Judiciary Committee added his voice to
those calling for Clinton's resignation. Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.,
said Sunday that resignation would be an honorable way to end the
11-month scandal and save the nation ``a lot of turmoil and
tumult.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La., has taken his most
significant step so far as the incoming speaker of the House by
declaring over the weekend his intentions to fight censure and to
vote to impeach Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, appearing subdued as he fielded questions while
standing beside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, said
resignation has ``never crossed my mind.'' And when asked directly
whether he would step down, Clinton said: ``I have no intention of
resigning.''
</P>
<P>
   The president also denied he committed perjury, which accounts
for two of the four charges against him, when he made misleading
testimony about his relationship with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, Netanyahu and their delegations spent more than two
hours discussing the troubled Middle East peace process on the eve
of Clinton's historic visit to Palestinian-controlled territories.
</P>
<P>
   But questions about impeachment and the sex scandal dominated
the news conference as Clinton also called on House members to
``vote their conscience'' and vowed not to lobby any members. And
he suggested that Republican leaders are refusing to allow a vote
on censure because they think it would pass.
</P>
<P>
   The House on Thursday will begin debate on articles of
impeachment for only the second time in American history. In 1868,
Andrew Johnson was impeached by the House but acquitted by the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment, a form of indictment, requires the Senate to hold a
trial to determine whether a president should be removed from
office. Following House Judiciary Committee action, Richard Nixon
resigned in 1973 rather than face impeachment by the House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he was not surprised by the House Judiciary
Committee vote to forward four articles of impeachment to the
floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's been obvious to anyone who is following it for
weeks that that vote was foreordained,'' Clinton said. ``And now it
is up to the members of the House of Representatives to vote their
conscience on the Constitution and the law, which I believe are
clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde urged Clinton to consider resignation as ``a quick and
radical solution to the dilemma that we have,'' in order to avoid
the impeachment vote and subsequent trial in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could really be heroic if he did that,'' Hyde said. ``He
would be the savior of his party. He would be welcomed around the
country at groups who would love to hear him speak. It would be a
way of going out with honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde was just one of a number of Republican lawmakers who fanned
out on the airwaves Sunday to call for Clinton's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would just hope that the president would put the American
people ahead of his own ambitions and resign,'' House Majority Whip
Tom DeLay, R-Sugar Land, said on NBC's Meet the Press. Majority
Leader Dick Armey, R-Irving, appearing on Fox News Sunday, said if
he were in Clinton's predicament he would have resigned long ago.
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Committee Democrats and Clinton's attorneys maintained
the impeachment charges are unwarranted because, while the
president has admitted wrongdoing, the events to do not rise to the
level of removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's defenders called his answers to questions about his
relationship with Lewinsky misleading and maddening but steadfastly
maintained the president did not lie.
</P>
<P>
   The impeachment counts charge Clinton with committing perjury
when he gave a deposition in the Paula Jones sexual harassment
lawsuit and when he testified before a grand jury. Clinton denied a
sexual relationship with Lewinsky, contending their affair did not
fit a definition of sex as provided by attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, especially moderate members who hold Clinton's fate
in their hands, have repeatedly called on him to drop his
legalistic answers and admit to lying under oath. The issue is
critical because the perjury articles are considered to have the
best chance of passage in the House.
</P>
<P>
   However, Clinton said he has no intention of making such an
admission.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is, no, I can't do that because I did not commit
perjury,'' he said, pointing to arguments by White House Counsel
Charles Ruff and four former federal prosecutors who contend the
misleading statements made by the president do not qualify as
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said those witnesses ``when through the law in great
detail and explained that this is not a perjury case. And there is
no credible argument on the other side. So I have no intention of
doing that. Now, was the testimony in the deposition difficult and
ambiguous and unhelpful? Yes, it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu attempted to help Clinton as he urged reporters to ask
questions about the peace process but to no avail. The White House
for weeks has limited Clinton's exposure to reporters. The
president last spoke on the issue on Friday as he again pronounced
his ``profound remorse'' for his actions and offered to accept a
censure as an appropriate punishment.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans, led by Speaker-elect Bob Livingston, R-La.,
are refusing to allow a censure resolution to be brought to the
floor as an alternative to impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you ought to ask them whether they're opposed to it
because they think it might pass, since, apparently, somewhere
around three-quarters of the American people think that's the right
thing to do,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., arguing
Republicans are ``obsessed'' with the notion of impeaching the
president, said on NBC's Meet the Press that Democrats on Capitol
Hill will push a procedural motion that will at least raise the
censure issue. But few Republicans, even those opposed to
impeachment, are likely to buck their party leadership and back the
Democrats on a procedural motion.
</P>
<P>
   Republican lawmakers insist a vote on impeachment can't be
dictated by the polls. ``Look, if Jesus Christ had taken a poll, he
would never have preached the gospel,'' Hyde said in an appearance
on ABC's This Week.
</P>
<P>
   The White House this weekend stepped up its efforts to get the
American public involved in the impeachment issue. Clinton
supporters contend people are busy with the holiday season and
unaware at how close Congress is to considering removing Clinton
from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the American people do have a say in this,'' said Joe
Lockhart, the White House spokesman. Referring to polls showing
most Americans oppose impeachment, Lockhart said that a ``small
group of people in the nation's capital ``are saying, `well, no, I
don't think the American people are right.'''
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Craig, Clinton's lawyer, this weekend urged people to
call or write their lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told reporters Sunday that he would not be calling
members to lobby them to oppose impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question of whether each member will simply vote his or
her conscience based on the Constitution and the law. I don't know
what's going to happen. That's up to them. It's out of my hands,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that he would be available to any member who wants to
ask him questions but ``otherwise, I think it's important that they
be free to make this decision and that they not be put under any
undue pressure from any quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   Several undecided Republicans said Sunday that Clinton had not
helped his cause by holding firm to the position that he did not
commit perjury.
</P>
<P>
   If the president had said publicly he committed perjury, ``it
would have helped us all,'' Rep. Jay Dickey, R-Ark. said on ABC's
This Week. ``It would have helped the nation for him to agree with
all of us that he did lie under oath.''

SHUTTLE CREW PREPARES FOR RETURN TO EARTH AFTER SUCCESSFUL MISSION
<TEXT>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Feeling triumphant over their success at joining the
first components of the new international space station, the
Endeavour astronauts undocked from the fledgling outpost on Sunday
to prepare for their return to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   The two components _ the $300 million, American-built Unity
module delivered by Endeavour and the $240 million, U.S.-financed,
Russian-developed Zarya module _ will circle the Earth uninhabited
until a shuttle crew returns with more equipment in May.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been an awesome experience,'' Endeavour commander Bob
Cabana told mission control. ``We've come a long way. We look
forward to seeing you build on this success.''
</P>
<P>
   Cabana supervised the shuttle's rendezvous with the already
orbiting Zarya module, the linkup of the two modules, three
spacewalks to distribute the electrical power, activate flight
control computers and install communications gear. He led an
American/Russian crew into the modules for the first time to
prepare them for future construction teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``This mission could not have gone any better,'' said Frank
Culbertson, NASA's space station program manager for operations.
``We've set a tremendous standard. It will be difficult to better
this mission, but we're going to have to try.''
</P>
<P>
   All told, the complete assembly of the new station will require
36 shuttle flights and nine Russian rocket launches over nearly six
years.
</P>
<P>
   With pilot Rick Sturckow at the controls, Endeavour was nudged
from the station's docking port on Sunday at 2:25 p.m., CST, as a
set of docking latches and springs between the two spacecraft were
released.
</P>
<P>
   For the next hour, he steered Endeavour in a graceful circle
around the outpost, allowing other shuttle crew members to film and
photograph it in detail from a distance of about 450 feet. NASA
engineers will scrutinize the imagery and use it to train future
assembly crews.
</P>
<P>
   With the operation complete, Cabana and Sturckow maneuvered
Endeavour slowly away.
</P>
<P>
   Endeavour is scheduled to land at the Kennedy Space Center in
Florida on Tuesday at 9:56 p.m., CST. Before returning to Earth,
the astronauts planned to deploy small experimental satellites
developed by Argentina and the U.S. Air Force.
</P>
<P>
   The station's first two modules now span a length of 76 feet
with a combined mass of about 35 tons. A pair of 38-foot solar
arrays for generating electricity jut from either side of the
Russian power and propulsion module, giving the complex a birdlike
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Following Endeavour's departure, ground control teams planned to
reorient the two modules into a stable, fuel efficient posture.
Unity will point to the center of the Earth and Zarya to deep space
as they sweep around the Earth at an altitude of 248 miles. The
modules will spin around their long axis once every 30 minutes to
regulate temperature variations.
</P>
<P>
   Once a week, ground controllers will reactivate Zarya's
propulsion system and update its guidance systems.
</P>
<P>
   The fledgling station will not have its own life support systems
and living quarters until the arrival of the already tardy Russian
service module. Russian economic difficulties have delayed its full
assembly and testing by 15 months, a factor that forced NASA to
postpone by a year its plans to begin the new station's orbital
construction with Endeavour's mission.
</P>
<P>
   Late this year, NASA funneled $60 million to the Russians in
exchange for more laboratory space on the new station to spur
completion of the service module. Currently slated for launching in
late July, the service module is undergoing testing and the
installation of final components at its production plant in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. confidence that the service module can successfully
complete its prelaunch, computer software testing has been
bolstered by the combined performance of the Zarya and Unity
modules, said Randy Brinkley, NASA's space station program manager.
The modules rely on an interplay of Russian software and American
flight control computers.
</P>
<P>
   If the service module's schedule holds, the station's first
resident crew, an American commander and two Russian cosmonauts,
should arrive in January 2000 for a three- to five-month stay.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, next year should be an active one for the new
station. NASA plans shuttle missions to the outpost in May, August,
October and December. Ten long spacewalks are planned to stow
equipment, check out the service module, add exterior truss work
and giant solar arrays to generate the electricity for a future
American laboratory module.
</P>
<P>
   The spacewalks and performance of the shuttle's robot arm will
be crucial to the success of those missions, just as they were on
Endeavour's
</P>
<P>
   Astronauts Jerry Ross, America's most experienced spacewalker
ever, and Jim Newman, conducted three successful spacewalks
spanning 21 hours, 22 minutes. Their efforts routed electrical
power from Zarya to Unity, afforded NASA's Mission Control Center
in Houston a vital satellite link and freed a pair of jammed
guidance system antennas on the Russian component.
</P>
<P>
   In all, an unprecedented 162 spacewalks will be needed to
construct an orbiting laboratory spanning an area equal to the size
of two football fields placed side-by-side. Sixteen countries are
involved.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three down, 159 to go,'' said NASA's Greg Harbaugh, who
supervises the planning for the station's Extra-Vehicular Activity,
or spacewalk effort. Those involved consider the number of
spacewalks a wall that must be scaled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a great start,'' said Harbaugh. ``We certainly
have a long way to go. But so far, so good.''

STATEHOOD BACKERS FALL SHORT IN PUERTO RICO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CINDY RODR I GUEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN _ Statehood supporters, hoping to win a referendum that
would propel this island nation toward becoming the United States'
51st state, came out in full force Sunday but fell short of their
dream by about 4 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   With 99 percent of the votes counted, the ``none of the above''
option adopted by the procommonwealth Popular Party was ahead, with
50.2 percent, compared with 46.5 percent for statehood. Turnout was
high with more than 80 percent of the registered residents heading
to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   In a similar nonbinding referendum in 1993, commonwealth status
beat out statehood by 49 to 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Until last week, polls had shown statehood leading slightly, but
the Popular Party's campaign picked up momentum.
</P>
<P>
   The party had urged a ``none of the above'' vote because it
objected to the ballot's commonwealth description, which was
written by the statehood party and suggested Congress could revoke
Puerto Ricans' US citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has asked Congress to abide by the result of
the referendum, but it was unclear what kind of message a ``none of
the above'' victory would send to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the numbers, prostatehood Governor Pedro Rossello
insisted his cause had won. Standing before a crowd of tens of
thousands of flag-waving Puerto Ricans, Rossello said statehood was
victorious because ``none of the above'' is not a status option.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, it is clear that statehood won. Today, the people spoke
and they say they want a change.'' He said he would take the
results of the election to Washington, minus the votes for ``none
of the above.''
</P>
<P>
   His words sparked controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be a travesty if he tries to bring Congress these
false figures,'' said former Governor Rafael Hernandez Colon, who
backs commonwealth status.
</P>
<P>
   Under such status, Puerto Rico is a US territory with local
autonomy. Its 3.9 million residents can't vote for president or
Congress, which alone can change Puerto Rico's political status.
</P>
<P>
   Voters trying to resolve the century-long debate on whether that
status ought to be changed also had the choices of independence or
a ``free association'' form of independence with US treaty ties.
Those options and a commonwealth as defined on the ballot garnered
about 3 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign for ``none of the above'' started slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Rossello decided in September to hold a locally sponsored
plebescite, when it seemed that Congress would not authorize one.
</P>
<P>
   The Popular Party planned a boycott, but realizing that
statehood might win, pushed the government to include a fifth
choice for voters that said ``none of the above.'' Supporters of
independence joined forces with them, making it a multiparty
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The Popular Party spent a little more than $2 million on its
campaign, compared with about $10 million spent by the prostatehood
New Progressive Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the only way we could democratically participate,''
said Sila M. Calderon, mayor of San Juan who is a proponent of the
status quo. She said the ballot's definitions of the options were
confusing and contained wording that would scare people from voting
to remain a commonwealth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Commonwealth is perfect for us,'' Calderon said. ``It gives us
a union with the US and allows us to maintain US citizenship, which
we cherish, but also allows us to maintain our own identity, our
fiscal autonomy, our language, and our Olympic team.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, nationalism is high among the residents of this tiny
Caribbean island.
</P>
<P>
   On a Sunday, when Puerto Ricans would normally spend their
morning in church, then watch sports on TV or play games with their
children, most people headed to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   They streamed into schools where they voted in booths that
resembled a bygone era, refrigerator-size cardboard boxes covered
by thin plastic curtains. There, they marked an ``X'' in pencil on
paper ballots.
</P>
<P>
   America Ortiz Vega, 58, a housewife who lives in San Juan, left
the polls at Sacred Heart University feeling positive that
statehood would lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been a commonwealth for 46 years and it's been good. Why
change it?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   As she walked away, she bumped into a friend, ``Here I am, ready
to vote for column five,'' the friend said, flashing five fingers
for the ``none of the above'' option.

   ``It's not like the statehooders say. Statehood won't bring more
wealth to the island. American companies won't come here because
they will have to pay corporate taxes,'' said Olga Ramirez Muniz,
44, a secretary for the Department of Agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez was speaking of a congressional act that gives US
companies huge tax breaks for investing in Puerto Rico, but
Congress will phase out these tax breaks by 2006.
</P>
<P>
   As Ramirez spoke, a Toyota sped by with a procommonwealth poster
taped to the back window that read, ``Este pueblo se respeta'' _
this country we respect.

PUERTO RICAN VOTE ENDORSES ISLAND'S STATUS QUO 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MIREYA NAVARRO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _ Puerto Ricans on Sunday rebuffed for a
second time in six years their governor's efforts to win statehood
by giving the most votes in a status referendum to a ``none of the
above'' option that many pro-commonwealth voters chose as a protest
against the use of that option as a means of splitting the vote.
</P>
<P>
   The vote effectively maintains the island's commonwealth
relationship with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The five options on the ballot were commonwealth, ``free
association'' (a form of independence that delegates certain powers
by treaty to the United States), statehood, independence, and
``none of the above.'' The fifth option won 50.2 percent of the
vote, compared with 46.5 for statehood. Independence received 2.5
percent of the vote, and the commonwealth and free association
options each received less than 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Historically divided over whether to seek a closer association
with the United States through statehood or to remain distinctly
self-governing as a commonwealth, the electorate this time was
split among options that confused some voters and angered many
others. The small vote for the option to maintain commonwealth
status was evidence of this, reflecting a boycott by the
pro-commonwealth Popular Democratic Party, which claimed the
definition of that option was misleading. The party had urged its
followers to vote for ``none of the above.''
</P>
<P>
   The referendum drew a turnout of 71.1 percent of registered
voters, compared with 73.6 percent in a similar referendum in 1993.
Some leaders of the independence movement had urged a boycott of
the voting altogether because the options were not defined by their
proponents and because the results of the vote would not be binding
on the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1993 vote, statehood lost to the commonwealth option by
46.2 percent to 48.4 percent, while 4.4 percent supported
independence.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, commonwealth leaders, who say the status quo
needs enhancements but remains sound, said the vote reaffirmed the
wish of Puerto Rico to continue its existing relationship with the
United States a century after the Spanish-American War brought the
two together.
</P>
<P>
   ``This vote means that we have here people who are proud of
their history, proud of their relationship with the United States,
proud of their American citizenship but, above all, proud of their
Puerto Ricanness,'' Anibal Acevedo Vila, president of the Popular
Democratic Party, told supporters at a victory rally. ``This has
been a reaffirmation of the commonwealth.''
</P>
<P>
   The loss for the statehood option appeared to be a major setback
for efforts by the ruling New Progressive Party to sway Congress
into authorizing a future binding vote on the incorporation of
Puerto Rico as the 51st state. Gov. Pedro Rossello has made the
pursuit of statehood for this island of 3.8 million residents his
main priority since taking office in 1992, and has counted on the
resources of incumbency to promote statehood here and in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   For this referendum, leaders of the statehood movement tried to
divide the opposition among the other four options. They also
crafted the entire ballot measure as a petition to the U.S.
government ``to resolve the current territorial problem of the
island,'' seeking to make each vote count as a mandate for change.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, the governor, too, claimed victory at his own
rally, saying that since the commonwealth option had garnered few
votes, ``the commonwealth is finished'' and that statehood had won
overwhelmingly among the four ballot options that called for a
specific status. Rossello said he recognized the winning ``none of
the above'' vote as a protest vote against him and his policies,
but not necessarily against statehood itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will inform Congress and the president of the United States
that among four options statehood surpassed 90 percent of support
by those who want a change for Puerto Rico,'' the governor said,
calling statehood ``the best future for Puerto Rico.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Congress, where opponents of statehood have cited
objections over issues of language and cost, reached the farthest
point on the question of self-determination for Puerto Rico when
the House passed a bill that would have set the terms for a vote to
seek a final status choice. The proposal stalled in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   It is not certain how Washington will interpret Sunday's vote.
Some members of Congress have said they will disregard the ``none
of the above'' votes because those votes convey no message. Jeffrey
Farrow, co-chairman of President Clinton's Interagency Group on
Puerto Rico, said Clinton was committed to respecting the choice of
more than 50 percent of voters and to take action to help implement
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message will be the votes cast for options one through
four,'' Farrow said earlier this week, referring to commonwealth,
free association, statehood and independence. ``The message that
will be cast for `none of the above' would be less clear. It
wouldn't give us any direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Popular Democratic leaders said they were forced to protest the
referendum because the government denied them participation in
crafting the ballot definition of commonwealth and that it ended up
unfairly portraying that status as one that does not even guarantee
American citizenship, which Puerto Ricans have had since 1917. But
leaders said their protest was against the ``undemocratic'' way the
ballot language was developed, not against a vote on
self-determination itself.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, the mayor of San Juan, Sila Calderon, a major
Popular Democratic Party leader, said ``the Puerto Rican people
have given a mandate for dialogue, for consensus and for clean
politics.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The two main camps _ commonwealth and statehood _ waged
advertising campaigns full of negative ads and scare tactics in
which both sides accused the other of gross distortions.
Pro-statehood ads, for example, said voting for an option other
than statehood could endanger Puerto Ricans' American citizenship.
Pro-commonwealth ads said a vote for statehood could turn the
island into ``an incorporated territory'' under which residents
would pay federal taxes but not get full congressional
representation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the barrage of ads, interviews with voters indicated
that as veterans of several status referendums, many were able to
sift through the rhetoric for the real issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're doing very well and will continue to do very
well with what we've got,'' said Josi Millan, 64, a retiree who
voted for ``none of the above'' to support the status quo. ``I
voted to stay the way we are, to keep our language, our culture,
the Latinismo, and the ability to participate in all the pageants
and sporting events.''
</P>
<P>
   Statehood, he added, ``would change who we are. Under statehood,
we would completely lose our Spanish language. Even though they
tell us again and again otherwise, eventually Spanish would be
lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Ricans, who this year marked the 100th anniversary since
their island was ceded to the United States by Spain after the
Spanish-American War, are American citizens who are governed by
federal law, including the military draft. But they do not pay
federal taxes, cannot vote on federal elections or elect
congressional delegations and do not receive federal benefits
comparable to the states.
</P>
<P>
   Statehood supporters here and in Washington say the status
denies equal rights and responsibilities and amounts to
second-class citizenship. Even commonwealth supporters say the time
has come for ``an enhanced commonwealth,'' one with more
self-governing powers to spur economic growth such as flexibility
for the island to enter into its own international trade deals to
create new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But the main pro-commonwealth leadership say the status needs
tinkering, not gutting. They say it is a unique relationship that
accommodates the island's considerable sense of nationhood _ it can
field its own Olympic team and beauty pageant contestants, for
example _ and gives Puerto Ricans the benefit of American
citizenship. The United States, in turn, gets a major market for
American products and American companies to invest in, and a major
contributor to the nation's defense.

HILLARY CLINTON MAKES CAREFULLY STAGED APPEAL FOR PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By WILLIAM A. ORME JR.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEVE SHALOM, Israel _ It took an Arab-Israeli village to provide
Hillary Clinton with the ideal backdrop for her first appearance
here, pleading the case to the Israeli public for the
land-for-security plan that is now seen here as much more her
husband's priority than the Israeli prime minister's.
</P>
<P>
   This tiny planned community of 30 families an hour outside
Jerusalem is one of the country's few experiments in cross-cultural
living. It has a bilingual school that has won international honors
and a carefully maintained ethnic balance of Arabs and Jews, all of
them Israeli citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The self-described ``oasis of peace'' was chosen as a symbol of
the possibility of reconciliation between Israel and the
Palestinians, the goal of the agreement brokered by President
Clinton six weeks ago in Wye Mills, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The town was flattered by the recognition. A big hand-drawn ``It
Takes A Village'' poster, referring to Mrs. Clinton's book, was
draped behind the podium where she made her nationally televised
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very grateful for the hard work that the prime minister
and Chairman Arafat and my husband did at Wye, that helped move us
closer to fulfilling a dream of peace between Israelis and
Palestinians, despite the setbacks that come when peace is being
pursued,'' Mrs. Clinton said, with Sara Netanyahu, the prime
minister's wife, sitting beside her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strong belief that peace will prevail must once again be
enforced,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving by White House limousine about 4 a.m. Washington time
for her first stop, Mrs. Clinton impressed local people with her
stamina and poise. Later in the day, she accompanied Clinton to a
memorial gathering at the Mount of Olives grave site of the slain
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and to a Hanukkah candle-lighting
ceremony at the Israeli presidential residence. She also attended
Clinton's speeches to Israeli youth leaders and a state banquet.
</P>
<P>
   But her independent itinerary before that was distinctly her
own: it was at once an advertisement for her vision of
multicultural education and community-based child-raising, and a
carefully targeted appeal to ordinary Israelis on behalf of the
U.S. peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   Her visit to Neve Shalom was followed by a visit to the oncology
ward of a Jerusalem children's hospital funded by an American
Jewish women's group, where Orthodox Jewish patients and
Palestinians from East Jerusalem receive cancer therapy. Mrs.
Clinton moved on to the headquarters of a home preschool program
that was started in Israel to meet the needs of poor Arab and
recent Jewish immigrant families, a program she helped adopt for
use in rural Arkansas 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   With fresh-scrubbed schoolchildren waving paper banners and
earnest young teachers discussing their techniques, the scene at
Neve Shalom seemed benignly archetypal for a Hillary Clinton visit.
Three kindergarten children _ Muhammed Najar, 4, an Israeli Arab
Muslim; Kerem Ben-Yeshai, 5, an Israeli Jew, and Mouna Boulos, 4,
an Israeli Arab Christian _ stood in their classroom before a
phalanx of cameras and solemnly lit a Ramadan lamp, a menorah, and,
with an electric switch, a little tabletop Christmas tree.
</P>
<P>
   The banners held aloft at Mrs. Clinton's arrival were adorned
with hastily crayoned flowers and doves, rather than national
symbols. The original plan was to greet Mrs. Clinton with real
flags, locals here said, but after fuller contemplation of the
spectacle, the event's handlers had second thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were going to have three flags, then they decided they
didn't want Palestinian flags, so they decided on no flags,'' Laila
Hasuna, an Arabic teacher at the Neve Shalom school, said with a
wry smile.
</P>
<P>
   It was widely presumed here that the ban on Palestinian
flag-waving was imposed mainly to protect Mrs. Clinton, who, on the
strength of one offhand comment this year, earned a reputation
among Israelis as a back-room advocate of independence for the West
Bank and the Gaza Strip, which she is scheduled to visit Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in May via satellite to a gathering of European
teen-agers, Mrs. Clinton said that she thought it was ``in the
long-term interests of the Middle East for Palestine to be a state
and for it to be a state that is responsible for its citizens'
well-being, a state that has responsibility for providing education
and health care and economic opportunity to its citizens, a state
that has to accept the responsibility of governing.''
</P>
<P>
   This seeming endorsement of statehood and her use of the
officially taboo term ``Palestine'' was condemned by American
Jewish organizations and quickly disavowed by the White House.
During her tour Sunday, Israeli journalists shouted questions on
Palestinian independence that were ignored.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Toronto Blue Jays general manager Gord Ash said
trading Roger Clemens wouldn't be Rocket science; he didn't say
anything about Economics 101.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Astros could do without that lecture, and they decided they
could do without the five-time Cy Young Award winner if it meant
drastically altering the team's financial structure. General
manager Gerry Hunsicker officially put an end to the Astros'
participation in the Clemens sweepstakes by announcing Sunday that
the club has halted its pursuit of the 36-year-old righthander.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Astros and Blue Jays never reached an agreement on
players, the biggest deterrent to striking a deal was Clemens'
insistence on a restructured contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``This came from an official qualification from Roger's agent
that any trade involving Roger would necessitate a restructuring of
his current contract,'' Hunsicker said. ``Philosophically, we're
opposed to that, but more importantly, the agents did give us the
terms they would be looking for and we were shocked; we were just
stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a situation where it's hard enough agonizing over the
talent that you may have to give up to trade for a player like
this. But in addition, you have to restructure his contract as if
he were a free agent on the open market and pay him what the elite
pitchers who have just signed over the last month are commanding.
Economically, there's just no way that we can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sources say Clemens, who already is under contract for $16.1
million over the next two seasons, asked for a new three-year deal
worth $43.5 million with a fourth-year vesting option worth an
additional $15 million. The deal called for a $12 million signing
bonus to be spread over the life of the contract, not to mention
the usual list of perks such as hotel suites when the team is on
the road, etc.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker informed a gathering of national media members of the
Astros' intentions during a news conference Sunday at the baseball
winter meetings, an address that angered Clemens' agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's inappropriate and unprofessional,'' said Randy
Hendricks, one of Clemens' Houston-based representatives. ``For
them to respond to me through a news conference is third-rate and
unprofessional.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros are believed to have been willing to part with
outfielder Derek Bell and righthanded pitcher Scott Elarton in a
package to acquire Clemens, but had they met Clemens' salary
demands, the club would have been forced to dump other
high-salaried players to stay within their budget.
</P>
<P>
   Said Hunsicker: ``Quite frankly, I think Roger would agree _ if
he understood what we'd have to do to make room for him _ even
after trading away the talent to secure his services, he wouldn't
be happy with the team we would be left with. Unfortunately, this
looks like the end of the Houston Astros' involvement in attempting
to trade for Roger Clemens.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, who has won back-to-back Cy Youngs and American League
pitching triple crowns, asked the Blue Jays to trade him earlier
this month based on a handshake agreement with former team
president Paul Beeston, who told Clemens he would trade him if the
pitcher no longer viewed the club as a contender.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 12 teams originally expressed interest in Clemens,
but the number had dwindled to five as recently as Friday. Some
clubs were turned off by the fact they had to not only reach an
agreement with the Blue Jays on players but also strike a new deal
with Clemens' agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very unusual,'' Hunsicker said. ``Philosophically, we're
opposed to this, because this is a player who is already under
contract, and we're attempting to trade for that player. In
addition to that, the player is suggesting that he also must have
his contract restructured. That's the first time I've ever been
involved in something like that, and quite frankly, I can't think
of another circumstance that I can remember where this has
happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you compete for someone's services in the free-agent
market, you understand the parameters; it's an open market, and you
can choose to compete or not to compete. When you're trying to
trade for a player, it normally comes down to whether you can
satisfy the club that currently has his services. But this has
become a combination of both; it's kind of like having your cake
and eating it, too. You're not a free agent, but you want to be
treated like a free agent.''
</P>
<P>
   Having found it too costly to acquire a proven No. 1 pitcher _
the Astros also pulled out of the running for Randy Johnson (four
years, $52.4 million from the Diamondbacks) last month _ the Astros
likely will enter next season with their current cast of players.
Hunsicker added All-Star third baseman Ken Caminiti earlier this
offseason, and he hopes to shore up the bullpen with a righthanded
reliever and bolster the bench with another righthanded hitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have been a very magical moment if we could have made
this trade, but I had a lot of misgivings about what we were going
to have to give up,'' said Astros manager Larry Dierker, whose
highest annual salary as a player was $130,000. ``It's not really
bothering me too much from a competitive standpoint that we keep
the players that we were going to trade and that we don't have
Roger, because I still think we're going to have a very good club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a little disappointed that we got this far down the
road and kind of got our hopes up and that the money issues were
going to be so dramatic and have such an impact on us that we just
couldn't make any sense out of it. It's one thing, I guess, if
you're the Yankees, but we're already headed for over-budget land
even without him (Clemens). I think we have a chance to win our
division, and I think we have a chance to get into the playoffs
again.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Clemens, the deep-pocketed Rangers and Yankees would
appear to have the best chance of satisfying his demands, along
with the Orioles and Rockies _ two teams that missed out on their
chance to sign a No. 1 starter when Kevin Brown brokered a
seven-year, $105 million contract with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to find out in the days and weeks to come what
kind of power he (Clemens) has,'' Dierker said. ``There may be some
teams that are better contenders than the Blue Jays that will also
meet these terms. But you're reducing the potential teams down to a
very small number, and I think the Blue Jays might have a
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Later on Sunday, Ash said: ``There has been a lot of interest in
Clemens since (the Astros' news conference). A lot of clubs thought
it was a foregone conclusion that he would wind up in Houston, and
they were just sitting back and waiting to see what happened. Roger
has demanded a trade, but that doesn't mean I have to trade him for
two cans of Diet Coke.''

A SYSTEM IN CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Now begins one of the gravest tests of the American
political system and of the men and women who occupy positions of
public trust.
</P>
<P>
   With the support of lawmakers from only one party, the House
Judiciary Committee is sending to the House floor four resolutions
to impeach the president of the other party, imperiling not only
President Clinton but also the ancient assumptions that so often
have kept Congresses in the past from resorting to this fateful
step.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the president and the Congress together are
exposing the entire political system to enormous danger.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the House Judiciary Committee has finished its work,
the strains the president put on the system _ his willingness to
have a sexual affair with an intern and then to maneuver to hide it
_ are being joined by strains the Congress is putting on the system
by pushing forward with impeachment in a highly partisan fashion.
</P>
<P>
   For a political system formed in a public revolt in the 18th
century and dependent on public consent to survive through the 21st
century, this is a situation of considerable risk.
</P>
<P>
   While scholars and commentators are viewing the contention in
the capital as a constitutional crisis, a titanic struggle between
branches of government, this year-end struggle is thrusting
Washington to the brink of a broader political crisis, one brewing
for years that has been muted recently only by the beguiling
background music of a robust economy.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when public impatience with Washington is at alarming
levels, Republican lawmakers are pushing Congress to take a step
the public opposes in response to presidential comportment the
public deplores.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's votes finally stripped from the proceedings the
personalities, the points of order and personal privilege, the
haggling over language, the disputes over due process, and revealed
the challenge that Clinton and the Republican Congress have hurled
at the political system that has sustained and rewarded them all.
</P>
<P>
   In an age when public alienation can be measured to
decimal-point authority, when the charcoal line that separates
public lives from private concerns has been smudged, when the
intrusive light of the media is shined into the darkest corner,
Washington is taking an extraordinary gamble. By a ratio of 2 to 1,
Americans believe the House Judiciary Committee has not paid enough
attention to what the American people think about impeachment,
according to a Newsweek poll being published in its editions
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can feel the anger pulsating at what Congress is doing,''
says Susan J. Tolchin, a George Mason University professor of
public policy who has written a book about public alienation from
politics. ``And though the American people are pretty slow to boil,
they may get very, very angry. The great public alienation appears
not to trouble either the Congress or the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   The president's misdeeds, in the White House with Monica S.
Lewinsky and twice in sworn testimony, are, as Republican
Representative Bill McCollum of Florida put it, an
``extraordinarily serious matter,'' one that undermines public
trust in Washington at a critical time. But the public is also
telling Washington that proceeding with impeachment will be
remembered in history, as Democratic Representative Charles E.
Schumer of New York put it, ``as something that America is not
proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment is a serious remedy, reserved for serious maladies
in the system. It has been contemplated seriously only three times,
and this is the first time it is being considered amid worries that
the remedy may itself contribute to the malady.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinarily lawmakers are chary of even tossing around the notion
of impeaching a president. Fifteen years ago, Representative Mickey
Leland, a maverick Democrat from Texas and ferocious critic of
President Ronald Reagan, asked the House to impeach Reagan for
ordering the invasion of Grenada. A day later, House Speaker Thomas
P. O'Neill of Massachusetts, who had played a critical role in
bringing Richard M. Nixon to the brink of impeachment in 1974, took
Leland aside and told him ``how we handle matters when we are in
disagreement with the president _ how it is that you don't respond
by trying to impeach the president on matters like this.''
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of the White House sex scandal, Democratic
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York used the phrase
``crisis of the regime.'' It was a reference to the president's
behavior with the onetime intern and to the White House's effort to
thwart the investigation of independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr.
Now, with the House only days from an impeachment vote on the
floor, that crisis has spread. The crisis of the regime has become
a crisis of the entire system.

2 DIE, DESPITE DOMESTIC-VIOLENCE SCREEN
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash.)   (jw)

<P>
   SEATTLE _ As a woman who told authorities she was a victim of
domestic abuse, in fear for her life and that of her 2-year-old
daughter, Melanie Edwards seemed to have done all the right things.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edwards had filed for divorce, obtained a protective order
against her estranged husband and moved to a secret location. She
strictly followed the procedure under which she dropped off the
daughter, Carli, at an agency for visitation with the husband, whom
the courts had given continued rights to see the child.
</P>
<P>
   But all the careful steps taken by Ms. Edwards failed to save
her or her daughter. On Wednesday night, moments after she returned
to the agency to pick up her child, Ms. Edwards was shot four times
in the head and body, and Carli was shot once in the chest. Both
are dead, and police here have begun an intensive manhunt for her
husband, Carlton Lee Edwards, whom Ms. Edwards had repeatedly
identified as the source of her fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very afraid for myself and my daughter,'' Ms. Edwards,
33, wrote in an Oct. 19 petition for a protective order. ``Carlton
has threatened to kill me many times since we have been together.''
</P>
<P>
   As an apparent case of domestic violence, the killing of Ms.
Edwards and her daughter is hardly unique. But among advocates for
the victims of such abuse, the case has clearly struck a particular
nerve, because she took such clear steps to follow the procedures
set up for such victims, and the system still failed her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a woman who followed the letter of the law _ she did
everything she could do under the law to keep herself and her
daughter safe,'' said June Wiley, manager of the community advocacy
program for New Beginnings for Battered Women and Their Children, a
Seattle agency that aids domestic-abuse victims.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wiley added: ``She was really forced to choose between the
devil and the deep blue sea. She could have moved, never to be
heard from again. The choice was, do I violate the court order and
protect my child or I do I comply and put myself and my daughter at
great risk? She followed the letter of the law, and she's dead.''
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the case points up the tensions in abuse cases
between the legal rights of the accuser and those of the accused.
In some cases involving custody fights, lawyers for the men
complain that the women can make up outrageous charges of abuse in
a bid to get sole custody.
</P>
<P>
   Though Ms. Edwards said her husband, who worked until recently
as an aircraft mechanic at the Seattle-Tacoma international
airport, had made repeated threats to kill her, he had not been
convicted of a crime; and while the authorities granted her
petition for a protective order against him, he was not deemed to
be a threat to his daughter.
</P>
<P>
   And so, as the divorce proceeding unfolded and Ms. Edwards'
assertions about the threats remained on file, Edwards, 37,
retained the right to four-hour visits with the daughter. Under the
procedures known as staggered visitation, which are common in cases
where women have received orders of protection but the men retain
rights to see their children, Ms. Edwards would go to the offices
of Common Ground, a local agency that acts as an intermediary
between estranged parents. Then she would drop off her daughter at
a pre-arranged time and leave.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen minutes later, Edwards would come and pick up his
daughter for a visit. At the end of his time with her, the
procedure would operate in reverse, with his dropping off the
daughter, leaving, and Ms. Edwards' returning afterward to retrieve
the daughter.
</P>
<P>
   That was what happened on Wednesday night, police said. But
rather than leaving, as he was legally required to do, Edwards
apparently stayed nearby, then shot Ms. Edwards and their daughter
shortly after his wife got to her car and buckled Carli in the back
seat, according to police.
</P>
<P>
   In her petition for a protective order, Ms. Edwards said she had
been threatened on many occasions, and physically beaten on others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carlton rushed in after me,'' she said in describing an
incident from this past summer. ``Carlton pushed me up against the
wall with his hands around my throat, choking me.'' She said her
husband told her, ``I'll kill you before I divorce you.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edwards had also removed a gun from their home and given it
to police, though Edwards quickly received a concealed-weapons
permit from an adjoining county and appeared to have simply bought
another gun.
</P>
<P>
   His response to her claims are not on file, and it is not clear
whether he hired a lawyer for the divorce proceeding. A police
spokeswoman said Sunday that Edwards was still on the loose and
that a fugitive-apprehension team, consisting of police officers,
sheriff's deputies and state corrections officers, was looking for
him.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before the killing, police said, Edwards withdrew
thousands of dollars from his own bank account and from a savings
account established for Carli, and about four hours after the
killing, he placed a cellular phone call to a friend in which he
said he was ``going away on a trip.''

LEW GRADE, 91, SHAPER OF BRITISH TV AND MOVIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Lew Grade, an immigrant from the slums of London's East
End who rose to become Britain's biggest impresario of popular
entertainment, died here Sunday at the age of 91.
</P>
<P>
   Founder of Britain's first commercially financed television
company, Lord Grade, who was knighted in 1963 and given a life
peerage in 1976, demonstrated his affinity for the common touch as
much with his buoyant personality as with his TV series and movies.
</P>
<P>
   His balding profile, with a trademark 9-inch cigar clenched in
his teeth, inspired the affection that the jowly silhouette of
Alfred Hitchcock once did. A set piece of London film premieres was
Lord Grade emerging in a wreath of smoke from his 1971 Phantom Six
Rolls-Royce.
</P>
<P>
   He demonstrated a talent for reinventing himself, springing back
from defeat and dispelling doom with humor. When one of his biggest
gambles, the $30 million movie ``Raise the Titanic'' sank under the
weight of dismissive reviews in 1980, he famously said, ``It would
have been cheaper to lower the Atlantic.''
</P>
<P>
   Lord Grade, who broke into show business as a champion
charleston dancer in 1926, was until last month still showing up
for 10-hour workdays and lighting the first of his seven daily
Monte Cristos in his office at 7:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in 1906 to Golda and Isaac Winogradsky in the
Ukrainian town of Tokmak. He was 6 when his Jewish family fled
czarist Russia for London's East End.
</P>
<P>
   At 14 he left school and joined his father in the rag business.
He pursued dancing to the stage of the Albert Hall, where in 1926
he won a contest and became the Charleston Champion of the World.
</P>
<P>
   For the next five years he worked as a hoofer, performing
throughout Europe. A knee ailment ended this early career, and in
1934 he embarked on another, joining his brother Leslie in founding
the Grade Organization, which became the biggest show-business
agency in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Grade was responsible for booking people like Bob Hope,
Jack Benny, Judy Garland, Mario Lanza and Danny Kaye into the
London Palladium. In 1955, he founded Associated Television, the
first such commercially financed company in Britain, to compete
with the British Broadcasting Corp.
</P>
<P>
   From the outset, he aimed at providing more lighthearted
entertainment than the BBC offerings, and later, when commercial
television expanded into serious undertakings, Lord Grade's end of
the business was thought of cozily by Britons as the ``song and
dance'' side.
</P>
<P>
   Associated Television became Associated Communications Corp., an
international group with 5,000 employees and annual turnover of
$420 million, but he lost control in 1982 in a bitter dispute with
the Australian financial entrepreneur Robert Holmes a Court.
</P>
<P>
   He became chairman and chief executive of Embassy Communications
International, the London headquarters of Embassy Communications, a
group of entertainment companies based in Los Angeles. When
Coca-Cola bought Embassy, Lord Grade set up Grade Co., which was
the co-producer of Andrew Lloyd Webber's ``Starlight Express'' on
Broadway. He was also elected a vice president of the Loews group
of movie theaters.
</P>
<P>
   He produced some of the most popular television shows on both
sides of the Atlantic, including Britain's first twice-weekly soap
opera, ``Emergency Ward 10,'' ``The Muppets,'' ``The Saint,'' ``The
Persuaders,'' ``Robin Hood,'' ``Sunday Night at the London
Palladium,'' ``Coronation Street'' and ``Space 1999.'' Movies he
produced included ``The Muppet Movie,'' ``On Golden Pond,''
``Sophie's Choice,'' ``The Eagle has Landed'' and two Pink Panther
films.
</P>
<P>
   The Grade family came to dominate show business in Britain. Lew
Grade's younger brother Bernie, also a lord, was head of EMI and
then became chief of Trusthouse Forte's leisure division, which he
bought out in 1983 to form First Leisure Corp. Michael Grade,
Leslie's son, cut a swath through British television, becoming in
turn director of programs for London Weekend Television and the
BBC, and finally the chief executive of Channel 4.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Grade is survived by his wife, Kathie; a son, Paul; and two
grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Marcia Stanton, Lord Grade's assistant for the past 35 years,
said Sunday that her greatest recollection would be her boss's
humor. ``He was asked at a public event what he wanted on his
gravestone,'' she said. ``Quick as a flash he replied, `I don't
want to go.'''

JOLTIN' JOE JOLTS ALIVE FOR $105 MILLION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Know what woke baseball legend Joe DiMaggio from that coma in a
Florida hospital? Someone in his room mentioned that a 33-year-old
pitcher named Kevin Brown had just signed a seven-year, $105
million contract.
</P>
<P>
   The 84-year-old former Yankee shot up in bed, asked a nurse for
his cleats and told his agent to get Scott Boras and Kevin Malone
on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Seriously, Saturday's news flash hit baseball the way Hurricane
Georges hit the Dominican Republic. Wreckage can be found from the
commissioner's office to every small market franchise.
</P>
<P>
   This offseason money orgy wasn't the message baseball wanted to
send its fans after a pretty magical season. All it does is drive
home the prevailing theme of sports in the '90s: It's all about the
money.
</P>
<P>
   There's no other interpretation. Everything boils down to who
has it, who wants it and who gets it.
</P>
<P>
   The big spenders this off-season have been those teams in big
markets (Yankees, Mets) or flush with corporate money (Fox/Dodgers,
Disney/Angels). Arizona has also been a player ($118 million
worth), because having an expansion franchise these days pays off
like bringing water to the desert.
</P>
<P>
   The free agent class of '99 goes
</P>
<P>
   will go down in history as the richest ever, and perhaps the
most covetous. Every member of the nouveau riche signed on the
dotted line for purely financial reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Don't listen to any of the spin about playing close to home, or
playing for a contender, or wanting to stay with a particular
franchise. It's all hooey.
</P>
<P>
   Those fans still in Mike Piazza's camp are agog that the Dodgers
would give a pitcher seven years and $105 million after refusing to
budge past six years and $84 million for a catcher with numbers
like .300, 30 and 100. But in the final analysis, the man himself
showed no proclivity to anything but getting the richest contract.
</P>
<P>
   Why else would he stay in New York, where fans booed him? When
push came to shove in L.A. and Fox-dom over Piazza, the words of
Piazza's agent rang truest: If he doesn't get the jack here, he'll
get it somewhere else. He did, $91 million from the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   When Mo Vaughn turned down Boston's final offer and decided to
play for $13 million-plus Disney dollars a year, Boston Globe
columnist Will McDonough replayed the last few years of Vaughn's
on-again, off-again negotiations with the Red Sox.
</P>
<P>
   At various times in the process, McDonough reported, Vaughn
turned down Red Sox offers of $9 million a year, $10 million a
year, $11 million a year, $12 million a year and finally $13
million a year. In every case, the Red Sox offer would have made
Vaughn one of the highest-salaried players in the game, if not the
highest. Yet the Red Sox were the ones painted as disloyal.
</P>
<P>
   When Randy Johnson and the Mariners were butting heads over a
multiyear contract, Johnson accused the team of reneging on old
promises and not caring about loyalty or fielding a winning team.
But it was Johnson who mailed in his first-half performance last
season before a post-trade salary drive in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   And, it turns out, the entire free agent game plan of Johnson
and his agent from the start was to get the left-hander to the
expansion D-Backs and his home in suburban Phoenix. And despite all
of Arizona's investments, I doubt if Johnson will be playing for a
winning team very soon.
</P>
<P>
   Today's news is Brown. By baseball standards, he's a pretty
mercenary guy. The Dodgers will be his fourth team in five years.
Yet the Dodgers' concern for his family, he says, put them over the
top. The club agreed to jet them into town pretty much whenever he
wants.
</P>
<P>
   But if he was truly concerned about his family down in Macon,
Georgia, wouldn't Brown have agreed to take less money from the
Braves and spare his family so much flight time? Or sign with St.
Louis, which is much closer than L.A.? When your agent is Scott
Boras, we're not inclined to believe anything mattered beyond
becoming the first nine-digit man in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Tomorrow's news will be the trade of Roger Clemens to a
franchise dedicated to winning, per a clause of the contract he
signed with the Blue Jays. Toronto wasn't exactly sad sack city
last year with a payroll of almost $40 million. But compared to the
new ceilings being raised in New York and Los Angeles, the Jays are
bottom feeders.
</P>
<P>
   Ergo, a trade demand. Wherever Clemens goes, his agent will be
sure to follow, with an offer to extend his client's contract and
bring it in line with today's new reality. After all, Clemens is
only 36, a mere two years older than Kevin Brown, who the Dodgers
believe will pitch them into the 2005 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Spin the view of these numbers to the other direction and
there's just as much carnage. This all started because owners like
George Steinbrenner and Ted Turner refused to control themselves
when free agency was in its diapers. As absurd as the Piazza and
Brown contracts may seem, they make perfect sense alongside a few
others.
</P>
<P>
   Like, Colorado giving Brian Bohanon $3.3 million a year,
Baltimore giving Mike Timlin $4 million a year, Texas giving Royce
Clayton $4.5 million a year, the Yankees giving Scott Brosius $5.2
million a year, Boston giving Jose Offermann $6.5 million a year,
Detroit giving Dean Palmer $7.2 million a year and Arizona giving
Todd Stottlemyre $8 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   If I'm a baseball general manager, like the Dodgers' Kevin
Malone, maybe I can explain all of this money malarkey. But I'm not
a G.M. To me, anything over a $1 million is funny money. And I've
stopped laughing.

SPORTS COLUMN: AN INSTANT MISPLAY BLEMISHES THE BRONCOS
</HEADLINE>
  (ms)

</P>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD , N.J. _ There was a peculiar symmetry between
the locker rooms at Giants Stadium before and after Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, the high-flying Denver Broncos were aspiring to
make National Football League history, rumbling toward posterity.
The young, struggling Giants were grasping for a slim playoff hope,
but were really playing for respectability.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, they occupied dramatically different worlds. In the
Giants' locker room, wide receiver Amani Toomer basked in the glory
of a game-winning 37-yard touchdown pass. Down the dark concrete
corridor in the visitors' lockerroom, Tito Paul, the 26-year-old
defensive back whom Toomer beat on the play, sat in front of his
locker. Head down, chin buried in his chest, Paul blamed himself
for everything from losing sight of Toomer to not going up more
aggressively for the ball. Paul sat there for 45 minutes, answering
questions, trying to put the loss in perspective, as teammates came
by and patted him on the back, whispered encouragement or simply
ignored him.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no consolation,'' he said. ``I know we have 11 guys
out there, but everybody's expected to do their job. I didn't hold
up my end.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos' winning streak, which ended at 18 games with their
20-16 loss to the Giants, had become part of their lives, their
identity. ``You can't help it,'' said Tyrone Braxton, the veteran
defensive back. ``Every day, every week people ask you about the
streak, it becomes a part of you.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver had not lost a game in nearly a year, not since a 34-17
loss to San Francisco last Dec. 15. Now Mike Shanahan, the Broncos'
head coach, was asked about the play that ended Denver's dream of a
perfect season. ``We all saw the same thing,'' he said. ``The guy
threw it up in the air and their receiver made a play and our
defensive back did not.''
</P>
<P>
   For players, for a franchise _ and for television networks _
Paul's misplay looms larger than a mere bad play that loses a game.
Denver was steaming toward posterity. No team except the 1972 Miami
Dolphins had gone undefeated. The Broncos needed three more
victories to complete a perfect regular season. What a great encore
to a Super Bowl championship. ABC was looking forward to next
Monday night's game between Denver and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Shannon Sharpe, the Broncos tight end, admitted that he had not
expected the streak to end at Giants Stadium. ``They're a good
young team, a quality team,'' Sharpe said. ``But no, I wouldn't
have thought it would end here. Not like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Davis, the Broncos running back, was so ill when he woke
up on Sunday that he thought he would not play. ``I thought there
was a 90 percent chance I wouldn't play,'' Davis said. ``I couldn't
lift my bag to get out of the room. It took so much energy just to
pack my bag and carry it down to the team meeting.'' Davis carried
28 times for 147 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The winning streak, which ended one game short of the NFL
record, might have been the underlying reason for the loss. Steve
Atwater, the veteran safety, said the Broncos may have been seduced
by the specter of setting a record. The Broncos had not played well
the previous three weeks; Atwater said the team was preparing for
the streak and not the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the problem; we weren't focused on winning, we were
focused on 14-0,'' he said. ``Sure you practice and all of that,
but in the back of your mind, the only thing you're thinking about
is the outcome of the game, not the job at hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Atwater said he hadn't said anything, ``because we were still
winning, but play was getting a little sloppy on game day.''
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Bill Romanowski had noticed the same thing. ``The
things you look for are, (a) how did we practice, and (b) how was
our focus in practice, our attention to detail,'' he said. ``We had
good practices last week. It didn't carry over into the game. There
wasn't a sense of urgency out there. That's what it takes every
single down. It wasn't there today.''
</P>
<P>
   Atwater added: ``People are talking about the Super Bowl. We've
still got two regular-season games to play and two playoff games.
It's crazy to be talking about the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly an hour after the game, the visitors' locker room was
practically deserted. A member of the Broncos media relations staff
encouraged Paul, as compassionately as possible, to get dressed: he
had given up the touchdown; now don't compound the problem by
holding up the team bus.
</P>
<P>
   Paul pulled on his shoes, his tweed jacket. He checked to make
sure he hadn't left anything more than hurt pride in his dressing
stall.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive backs, like gunners in basketball, generally have
short memories. ``I won't be forgetting about this soon,'' he
sighed. He walked out, past the friends and families of the Giants
he had made so happy.
</P>
<P>
   The streak was over. The Broncos had lost a bit of luster; now
they're just another good team trying to reach the Super Bowl.
While Toomer's world reverberated with cheers, all Paul would hear
was Shanahan's blunt analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their receiver made a play,'' he said, ``and our defensive
back did not.''

PRESIDENT ASSERTS HE BROKE NO LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER   AND CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, speaking even as Republican
lawmakers said he might spare himself from impeachment if he
confessed to perjury, said Sunday he had not broken the law and so
he could not admit to doing so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not commit perjury. ... I could not admit to doing
something that I am quite sure I did not do,'' Clinton said during
a news conference in Jerusalem, where he is trying to revive the
stalled Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
   The president also said he would not resign, even if the House
votes later this week to send impeachment charges to the Senate.
His comments came as a leading Republican, Representative Henry
Hyde, chairman of the House panel that approved impeachment charges
against Clinton last week, called on the president to step down,
and House majority whip Tom DeLay said Clinton should ``consider''
leaving office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no intention of resigning,'' Clinton said. ``It's never
crossed my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Without invoking his name, the president also took aim at
Republican Representative Bob Livingston, speaker-elect of the
House, for announcing that he would fight a Democratic effort to
censure Clinton rather than impeach him. Under the Constitution,
Livingston said Saturday, the House may impeach or not impeach the
president, but it has no authority to censure.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton suggested that House leaders oppose censure ``because
they think that it might pass, since apparently somewhere around
three-quarters of the American people think that's the right thing
to do.'' A vote of censure would allow the House to condemn
Clinton's behavior without moving to eject him from office.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton commented on impeachment at a joint appearance with
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, where the Israeli leader
met little success in urging reporters to set aside impeachment and
``to ask one or two questions on the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Clinton's first press conference since the House
Judiciary Committee voted Friday and Saturday to send impeachment
charges to the full House, and it marked the second time since
Friday that Clinton spoke publicly about the charges while turning
aside Republican pleas that he admit to perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four impeachment charges approved by the Judiciary panel,
one accuses Clinton of lying in a civil deposition about his
relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky, and one accuses him of lying
to a grand jury about the affair. The two others charge the
president with obstructing justice and misusing the powers of his
office to interfere with witnesses and investigators in the
Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   As the House prepares to vote on impeachment as early as
Thursday, Clinton's fate rests with 20 or so Republican lawmakers
who are undecided on whether to approve the charges, sending them
to the Senate for trial. Some of those lawmakers said Sunday that
Clinton's refusal to admit to perjury might give them a reason to
vote for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president hurt himself very clearly this
morning,'' said Representative Bob Ney, Republican of Ohio,
referring to Clinton's comments in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not getting leadership from the White House. If it is,
it's negative leadership,'' said Representative Jay Dickey,
Republican of Arkansas, who appeared with Ney on the ABC television
program ``This Week.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, who has said he will vote for impeachment, said some
Republicans would vote against impeachment if only Clinton ``would
say the magic words that he did lie to the grand jury.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there are some Republicans who would feel different if
he were to admit to his wrongdoing. ... It's hard to forgive
somebody when they don't admit they've done wrong,'' Hyde said on
the CBS program ``Face the Nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde also called on Clinton to resign in order to end the
impeachment process. ``He could really be heroic if he did that,''
Hyde said. ``He would be the savior of his party. He would be
welcomed around the country at groups who would love to hear him
speak. It would be a way of going out with honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Delay, who as whip is responsible for counting votes for the
House Republican leadership, said that the upcoming vote ``is too
close to call'' and ``could be a 50-50 chance for impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   While the White House has encouraged business executives and
political allies to call undecided lawmakers on the president's
behalf, both Clinton and DeLay said they were not directly lobbying
House members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have talked to those _ a few _ who said they wanted to talk
to me,'' Clinton said in Jerusalem. ``Otherwise, I have not. I
don't think it's appropriate for me to be personally calling
people, unless they send word to me that there is something they
want to ask or something they want to say.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said he had given ``difficult and ambiguous and
unhelpful'' testimony in a deposition connected to the Paula Jones
sexual harassment suit,but that the House Judiciary Committee was
wrong in finding on Friday that his words amounted to perjury. He
noted that four legal experts who testified on his behalf before
the committee, two of them Republicans, agreed that he had not
committed perjury.
</P>
<P>
   In an odd coincidence of history, President Richard M. Nixon
visited Israel just one month before the House Judiciary Committee
voted on articles of impeachment against him in 1974. Like
Clinton's visit, Nixon's was meant to promote the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   There are profound differences between the Clinton and Nixon
visits. Nixon's fate was essentially sealed when he came to Israel,
and Clinton's clearly is not. But Hemi Shalev, a columnist for
Ma'ariv newspaper, cited a statement made by the late Israeli Prime
Minister Golda Meir during Nixon's visit that could be said of
Clinton today:
</P>
<P>
   ``The president was here, but his thoughts were very far away.''
</P>
<P>
   During his news conference Sunday, Clinton promised a ``prompt''
decision on whether to free Jonathan Pollard, a former US Navy
intelligence analyst who pleaded guilty in 1986 to spying for
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, during peace talks in Maryland, Netanyahu had asked
for leniency for Pollard, who is serving a life sentence. Clinton
promised to review the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have instituted the review that I pledged to the prime
minister,'' Clinton said Sunday. He said he had instructed White
House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff to seek the advice of all relevant
intelligence and security agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu said that Pollard is serving ``a very, very heavy
sentence, and since he was sent by us on a mission ... we hope that
on a purely humanitarian appeal a way will be found to release
him.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By declaring his intentions to fight censure and to
vote to impeach President Clinton, Rep. Robert Livingston, R-La.,
has taken his most significant step so far as the incoming speaker
of the House and has perhaps defined himself for the duration of
his tenure _ even though he has yet to be sworn in.
</P>
<P>
   His comments, made after the Judiciary Committee voted in favor
of the last of four articles of impeachment and against censure,
mark him as the fierce institutionalist that many know him to be.
But they also reveal him as a fierce conservative and a fierce
Republican partisan, which Livingston has been at some pains to
tamp down as he assumes the mantle of speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Now impeachment has shattered his plans, which were basically to
maintain order and keep the trains running on time after the
paralyzing highs and lows that engulfed outgoing Speaker Newt
Gingrich. Impeachment has thrust Livingston into the unfamiliar
realm of high-stakes national politics, and if it spills over into
the Senate next year, it could overshadow any attempt at a coherent
Republican agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston, a former criminal prosecutor, said in an interview
Saturday night that he would vote for impeachment when the full
House takes up the matter on Thursday and expressed an apparently
pent-up belief that Clinton's behavior was on a par with, if not
worse than, President Nixon's during Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he said, ``a pretty concrete case'' of perjury had been
built against Clinton, a charge not brought against Nixon. ``So why
was impeachment the remedy for Nixon and not for Clinton?'' he
asked, reflecting the eye-for-an-eye vengeance that now drives much
of politics in Washington and that has been an unspoken force in
the conservative thrust against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he would mount a strong campaign in the House
against a Democratic move to censure Clinton instead of impeaching
him. Such a campaign is technically about House rules but is really
a party's call to arms. This will be Livingston's first test of
power, of whether he can control his diverse Republican flock on a
matter of personal and party loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview, Livingston laid down a marker, saying that a
move for censure in the House would be unconstitutional (although
scholars disagree on this) and that he would perceive any
Republican vote for censure as an affront to the speakership and a
betrayal of the party.
</P>
<P>
   ``An attack on the rules is an attack on the chair is an attack
on the majority,'' he said, his clearest expression to date that
the procedural is political.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next few days, he will be making that argument to his
colleagues, transforming himself virtually overnight from a
seemingly impartial observer of the impeachment drama to one of its
central players.
</P>
<P>
   It has been easy to forget that Livingston, 55, holds deeply
ingrained conservative views. His home district in suburban New
Orleans twice rejected Bill Clinton for president, preferring Bob
Dole in 1996 and George Bush in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Since he publicly declared on Nov. 6 that he was going after
Gingrich's job and prompted Gingrich to resign, Livingston has
deliberately projected a low-key non-Newtness, preferring to stay
in the background, keep his head down and tweak the nuts and bolts
of his transition machinery rather than grab a national platform.
</P>
<P>
   Friends have various explanations for why he seemed to go
underground. They say he was haunted by the picture of himself as
intemperate and intransigent during the 1995 government shutdown,
when he thundered on the House floor: ``We will never, never, never
give in! We will stay here until doomsday!''
</P>
<P>
   They say he did not want to begin his speakership _ he is to be
sworn in Jan. 6, with a slim six-vote majority _ by either
disappointing conservatives who were calling for Clinton's head or
alienating moderates who saw no percentage in impeachment. And,
they say, as a former committee chairman, his natural inclination
was to defer to Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   In an important signal to his party, Livingston appointed a
conservative and a moderate _ Reps. Ron Packard of California and
Marge Roukema of New Jersey, respectively _ to chair his transition
team. And he has picked another conservative-moderate duo, Reps.
Steve Largent of Oklahoma and Jennifer Dunn of Washington, to
deliver the Republican response to Clinton's State of the Union
message in January.
</P>
<P>
   But he seemed so conciliatory, and so removed from impeachment,
that some in his party were getting worried. Rep. Tom DeLay,
R-Texas, No. 3 in the Republican House leadership, was rapidly
filling the power vacuum. Hyde was getting bloodied. Some were
starting to whisper that Livingston was not up to the job of
speaker.
</P>
<P>
   With the Judiciary Committee's vote and his public comments,
Livingston has now assumed responsibility for the direction of
impeachment in the House. It was clear that he has been
coordinating some strategy with Hyde and DeLay, although he has
refrained from joining their call for Clinton to resign. But he
shares DeLay's view of impeachment, saying that it is ``merely
bringing a charge against the president'' and that it is up to the
Senate to decide what to do about it.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats are making clear that they perceive Livingston's
opposition to censure as a grave mistake that could undo the
conciliatory gestures he has made so far. In a letter to Livingston
seeking a vote on censure, Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the
Democratic leader, wrote: ``Your decision regarding these
proceedings will decide whether or not history will mark our
actions as a purely political exercise or a high-minded debate.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Delahunt, D-Mass., a member of the Judiciary
Committee, who is also pressing for a vote on censure, took issue
with Livingston's rather passive characterization of his task.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't simply just sending over some charges,'' Delahunt
said. ``This is about removing the president. This is the first
step in launching a nuclear missile.''

MEETING A GENUINE STARLET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The best 2-year-olds in the prolific Bob
Baffert barn might be a pair of fillies.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Excellent Meeting, ridden by Kent Desormeaux, won the
$400,000 Hollywood Starlet by eight lengths, just missing the
record for the 1 1/16-mile stakes and becoming the first to sweep
the major 2-year-old filly races at Del Mar, Santa Anita and
Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   John and Betty Mabee's Excellent Meeting laid claim to the
national division championship that's expected to go to Mike
Pegram's Silverbulletday, who beat her in the Breeders' Cup
Juvenile Fillies at Churchill Downs after running fourth behind her
at Del Mar.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are just two exceptional fillies,'' said Baffert,
declining to take sides.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert hopes 2-year-old colts Exploit and Prime Timber will get
him to the May 1 Kentucky Derby, which he won the past two years.
But he concedes the fillies are ahead of the colts because they're
better seasoned.
</P>
<P>
   Silverbulletday is 6 for 7 after racing mostly in Kentucky in
1998. Excellent Meeting is 4 for 7 after her dominating victory
over front-running Lacquaria in the Starlet.
</P>
<P>
   Excellent Meeting ($3) was clocked at 1:42.14, about one-fifth
of a second slower than Serena's Song's winning time in 1994.
Serena's Song _ who went on to earn the 3-year-old fillies'
championship _ had been the only winner of Santa Anita's Oak Leaf
Stakes to also take the Starlet.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert's first Starlet victory came a day after he watched Hal
Earnhardt's Premier Property suffer a fatal breakdown following the
colt's third-place finish in the Hollywood Futurity.
</P>
<P>
   ``You not only feel for the horse, you feel for the owner,''
Baffert said. ``The next day, I win the Starlet; I've got other
horses. But for (Earnhardt), he had a nice horse, he had his family
here, he's dreaming of traveling and seeing the horse run, and then
suddenly that's over.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Sunday, Corey Nakatani rallied Tuzla ($3.20) from an
unaccustomed last between horses and wore down Sonja's Faith and
Emile Ramsammy to win the $100,000 Dahlia Handicap, making the
filly 4 for 4 on the Hollywood Park turf.
</P>
<P>
   Tuzla's owner, television writer-producer David Milch, was asked
which of his ``NYPD Blues'' characters the winner of 8 of 15 is
like.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a lot prettier than Sipowicz, but she shows the (same)
trait that she keeps on coming,'' Milch said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Notes: As the meet's final, six-day week begins Wednesday,
Garrett Gomez will lead the jockeys by two wins (over Alex Solis)
and Neil Drysdale will lead the trainers by three (over seven
others). . . . Mass Cap and Hollywood Gold Cup runnerup Puerto
Madero is expected to head the Native Diver Handicap Sunday.

LIKE Mike Tyson, life bites. This is our profound thought for the
holidays.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the most complicated negotiation of the gift-giving season,
the Astros might have met Toronto's price, and they might have met
Roger Clemens' price, but not both.
</P>
<P>
   So the Astros, once thought to be the hometown favorite in this
auction, withdrew Sunday from the bidding for the five-time Cy
Young Award winner. There are many ways to look at this
development, none of them happily.
</P>
<P>
   As fans, we are disillusioned. Isn't home where the heart is?
Isn't love supposed to find a way? Roger loves Houston; he lives
here. He grew up in the neighborhood, educating his fastball at San
Jacinto College and the University of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   And the Astros, politely dabbing at the drool on their chin,
surely wanted to bring Clemens home again. But think of Toronto as
the in-laws, looking for a hefty dowry. Think of Alan and Randy
Hendricks, his Houston-based agents, as Roger's guardians, whose
goal is to provide security for future generations of the Clemens
clan.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Roger won 20 games with only six losses for the Blue
Jays and for the 10th time since 1986 struck out more than 200
batters. No pitcher in either league has been so dominant for so
long. He is powerful enough to fire the ballclub for failing to
make the moves necessary to qualify as a contender.
</P>
<P>
   You can see the fans choosing sides. The Astros are disenchanted
that Roger required a raise above his present $8 million salary to
pitch in a stadium 30 minutes from his house. Some fans will
wonder, ``How can Houston bid for the Olympics but not afford Roger
Clemens?''
</P>
<P>
   As Daisy said to a lovesick Jay Gatsby, ``Haven't you heard?
Rich girls don't marry poor boys.'' (Gatsby hit it big, but Daisy
didn't wait.)
</P>
<P>
   In material things, the Astros were poor once. But they have won
their division two seasons in a row, and year after next they move
into their palatial new digs on the right side of the railroad
tracks. Still, you never forget how it felt to be poor, surviving
on a low-revenue team's budget.
</P>
<P>
   So a perfect match doesn't get made, and the Rocket will take
his Hall of Fame talent to another town. This assumes, of course,
that there is a club out there that can give up the package of
players the Blue Jays want and pay Clemens the going rate for a
franchise pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Is it possible this is what Toronto had in mind all along? Its
best shot at keeping Roger is to price him out of the market. Based
on the talent it is said to be demanding in return, Toronto wants
to become a separate country. The money is altogether another
issue.
</P>
<P>
   The bar was not only raised but launched into orbit when Arizona
signed Randy Johnson and the Dodgers hooked Kevin Brown. These
contracts were so humongous, they changed the language. When
players talk about Randy Johnson money, they mean a contract
averaging $13 million a year. Of course, this amount is trumped by
Kevin Brown money, $15 million per.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros were willing to go as high as $11 million for Johnson
because doing so did not involve giving up Christmas. They had
acquired Randy in a midsummer deal for three minor-leaguers, and no
other players would be involved.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Johnson signed with the Diamondbacks, who lost 97
games in their first season. As they say, winning isn't everything.
Randy's home is in Phoenix, and so were the millions. Two out of
three isn't bad.
</P>
<P>
   No team likes to see a big one get away. But Clemens represents
a deeper hurt because he provides more than wins and strikeouts and
box office. Without a doubt, he would have been treated as family,
Nolan Ryan with a temper.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, the year he won his first Cy Young Award, Roger led the
majors with 24 wins, was the winning pitcher in the All-Star Game
and carried the Red Sox into the World Series. In 1990, he became
the first pitcher ever to be ejected from a playoff game when he
expressed his disapproval of a missed call in terms that offended
umpire Terry Cooney.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he was talking to himself, as he often does, letting
off steam. If he cursed, at least initially, he did so in a generic
way. What he said to Cooney, several witnesses testified, was:
``I'm not (expletive deleted) talking to you. Keep your (expletive
deleted) mask on.'' But Cooney jawed back, and the dialogue quickly
went downhill from there.
</P>
<P>
   With a lineup that included Mark McGwire and Jose Canseco, the
Oakland A's swept the Red Sox in four games without hitting a home
run. This is greatness.
</P>
<P>
   After an investigation by the commissioner's office, including
testimony by a lip reader, Roger received a short suspension at the
start of the next season and a $10,000 fine. No one ever denied
that Clemens is a competitor. How sad that he won't be competing in
his hometown.

ASTROS WON'T MEET CLEMENS' PAY DEMAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ The angry backlash to Kevin Brown's
record-setting $105 million contract took only 24 hours to manifest
itself. The Houston Astros, one of a handful of teams considering a
trade for the star pitcher Roger Clemens, loudly withdrew from the
negotiations Sunday, with an Astros executive saying he was
``stunned and outraged'' by Clemens' contract demands.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens' agents have asked that a one-year, $27.4 million
extension be added to the two years remaining on his contract with
the Toronto Blue Jays, according to officials with two teams.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens is to be paid $8 million for 1999 and $8.1 million for
2000, and the proposed extension would increase the value of his
deal to $43.5 million over three years, an average of $14.5
million, almost equal to Brown's average yearly salary. Clemens'
agents _ who could not be reached for comment _ are also said to be
asking for a list of perquisites, including a private box.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Hunsicker, Houston's general manager, did not mask his
disgust; rather, he called a news conference to declare it. ``Quite
frankly, we were absolutely stunned and really outraged by the
demands,'' Hunsicker said. ``It was mind-boggling.''
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Rangers and the Colorado Rockies now appear to be the
front-runners to complete a deal for Clemens, with the New York
Yankees, the New York Mets and the Cleveland Indians all on the
periphery, not really in or out of the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker's pointed remarks had other baseball officials
chortling. Teams usually pull out of trade talks quietly, with
private words delivered directly from one executive to another.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing his intentions publicly, Hunsicker may have
seriously damaged Toronto's leverage in its trade talks. Teams that
are serious about acquiring Clemens, like Texas and Colorado, know
the competition is reduced; teams with lukewarm interest, like the
Yankees and the Indians, can fall in line behind Houston's outrage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly like the player,'' said Brian Cashman, the
Yankees' general manager. ``But the price on the player and our
payroll would be very high. If the price tag goes down, maybe we
can do business.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, a five-time Cy Young award winner, is available after
exercising a contract option and has asked the Blue Jays to trade
him. Clemens also has the right to veto any trade, meaning that
unless he receives an acceptable renegotiated contract, he can
reject any deal.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker's frustration stems from the fact that the Astros
would not only have to trade four quality players for Clemens, but
they would also have to pay him like a free agent. Hunsicker
believes Clemens' agents, Randy and Alan Hendricks, have complete
control of the trade talks because of their agreement with the Blue
Jays.
</P>
<P>
   Hunsicker was also upset that during more than a week of trade
talks with the Toronto officials, the Blue Jays' executives had not
told them how much money Clemens would demand and how much the
agents would control the discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine there would be a precedent here where people
would want to put themselves in the same situation as the Blue Jays
did,'' Hunsicker said.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset of trade talks, Toronto General Manager Gord Ash
said Clemens' two priorities were to play for a winner and to play
for a team close to his home, which is near Houston. But privately,
other executives believed Clemens' primary concern was to
renegotiate his contract in the current climate of escalating
salaries.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Now that Clemens' chances of playing for Houston, a team that
won a division title in 1998 and is within minutes of his home, are
all but ended, Hunsicker was asked whether money was the priority
all along. He raised his eyebrows and told reporters to reach their
own conclusions.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking generally about the way agents are negotiating,
Hunsicker said: ``They're trying to extract the last nickel out of
the system, and obviously this is not a matter of whether someone
has the ability to pay their bills from month to month. This has
gone way past that _ it's one-upmanship is what it is, and
certainly we're not in a position to compete with some of the
madness that has gone on in this industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just extremely concerned for the health of the industry,
especially with corporations getting involved in ownership, that
the playing field has become unlevel. What we're creating here is a
small country-club type of situation where a handful of teams can
compete for the services of the elite players and everyone else
takes what is left over. This is just another prime example how
most of us, including the Houston Astros, really can't compete for
the services of the elite players.''
</P>
<P>
   Told of Hunsicker's comments, Ash said drily: ``Gerry's got a
lot of opinions about a lot of things. I guess that comes with
being executive of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Toronto completed one trade Saturday, swapping pitcher Woody
Williams, pitcher Carlos Almanzar and the Class A outfielder Pete
Tucci to San Diego for the right-hander Joey Hamilton. The Yankees
are courting offers for third baseman Mike Lowell, negotiating at
length with the Padres Sunday night, and the Padres want to package
Tucci and another player to trade for Lowell.

COMMENTARY: IS IT LITERATURE _ OR MERELY AN ENTERTAINMENT?
</HEADLINE>
   (jw) 
 By VERLYN KLINKENBORG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the early 19th century, a critic wrote these words in the
Edinburgh Review about a long-forgotten work of fiction: ``The main
question as to a novel is _ did it amuse? were you surprised at
dinner coming so soon? did you mistake eleven for ten? and twelve
for eleven? were you too late to dress? and did you sit up beyond
the usual hour? If a novel produces these effects, it is good; if
it does not _ story, language, love, scandal itself cannot save
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, this is an ironclad measure of entertainment, but not of
literature. It has the amiable demerit of allowing each reader to
come to his own conclusions about the value of a novel, conclusions
based on the reader's own capacity for literary seduction. The
novels that induce this pleasant sensation of timelessness will be
as different as the dinners that grow cold waiting for abstracted
readers, as different, in fact, as the readers who at last put down
their books and take up their forks. This standard easily
encompasses works like Norman Mailer's ``The Naked and the Dead,''
John Updike's Rabbit Angstrom novels, and Tom Wolfe's new novel,
``A Man in Full,'' not to mention half the paperbacks embossed with
deep decolletage.
</P>
<P>
   Updike and Mailer have recently stated in printed reviews that
Wolfe's new novel is not literature, all the while admitting that
``A Man in Full'' satisfies the cold-dinner standard of amusement.
The question naturally arises, why have they done this and what
gives them the right? Had Mailer and Updike declared that ``A Man
in Full'' was literature, they could not make it so. Not even Helen
Vendler has that power.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, deciding what is literature is always a
retrospective task, and the two months since Wolfe's book was
published are not long enough to let posterity do its work. What
Updike and Mailer offered were closely reasoned opinions, which are
worth taking seriously because of their experience as readers. The
fact that both men are also writers has almost nothing to do with
the value of their opinions in this case, though it gives the
resulting brouhaha a piquantly fraternal air.
</P>
<P>
   The question remains: Why have they done this? They did it
because it was dead certain that Wolfe would claim ``A Man in
Full'' is literature. He cannot make it so by fiat either. To
borrow one of his own phrases, Wolfe has been mau-mauing the
literati for the last 25 years. He has advanced in print and at
length the argument that novelists need to take the broad sweep of
society as their subject and to base their work on more extensive
reporting. This argument is the rhetorical equivalent of wearing a
white three-piece suit in public, a way of attracting attention. It
is especially ridiculous in the context of this fracas with Mailer
and Updike, much of whose work is as craftily and extensively
reported _ as evocative of its moment _ as even Balzac could wish.
</P>
<P>
   Each of these three men has written works of literature. Dinners
may go cold and readers may go hungry over ``A Man in Full,'' but
Wolfe's most lasting writing has been in the genre of nonfiction.
Ironically, like many writers, he has overvalued the novel by
abandoning nonfiction, and, ironically, he has underestimated the
extent to which all fiction, not just his own, is based on fact.

`NO ALTERNATIVE' TO PEACE, CLINTON TELLS YOUNG 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; JERUSALEM _ President Clinton chose an audience of high school
students to deliver a stern message Sunday on the need for both
Israelis and Palestinians to implement the imperiled peace process.
</P>
<P>
   And in Clintonian fashion, with Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu of Israel listening at his side, he spoke to the young
people in their own language about the benefits of peace.
</P>
<P>
   He began by painting a bleak picture of an Israel under
``permanent siege,'' with a ``gnawing anxiety'' as it ``remains
preoccupied with its very survival.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton told the students, ``Perhaps you can live with that kind
of future, but you should not accept it unless you are willing to
say _ and I will try to say it properly _ ``ein breirah'' _ there
is no alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hebrew phrase has been a kind of rallying cry that Israeli
leaders have used through decades of conflict with the nation's
Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   Then Clinton added, ``But if you are unwilling to give up on
hope with no real gain in security, you must say ``yesh breirah'' _
`yes, there is an alternative.'''
</P>
<P>
   The students, a cross-section of a divided society, burst into
applause. Conservatively dressed religious students from Jerusalem,
secular Israelis with pierced noses and spandex from Tel Aviv, and
neatly dressed youths from the suburbs gave him a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   After the speech, Ohad Shiron, 18, from the sprawling suburban
housing complex of Mevasarett, said: ``It gave us hope and gave us
a way to see that we are the future. If we want peace we have to
change attitudes, not just follow leaders who sign pieces of
paper.''
</P>
<P>
   In the half-hour address to the students at the Jerusalem
Convention Center, Clinton sold the benefits of peace, saying it
would lead to economic prosperity and a secure future for Israelis
and Palestinians. He stressed that ``the United States will always
stand with Israel.'' But Clinton also emphasized that both sides
must live up to the commitments made at the Wye River Plantation in
Maryland in October.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's three-day visit was initially intended to celebrate
the interim land-for-security deal worked out at Wye.
</P>
<P>
   But it has become a personal and historic mission to save the
Wye agreement. Escalating street violence by Palestinian
demonstrators, and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's repeated
assertions that he would unilaterally declare a Palestinian state
in May, prompted Netanyahu to issue an ultimatum suspending an
implementation agreement. Netanyahu has said he would cede no more
West Bank land until Arafat stated that he would not unilaterally
declare a state.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to visit Palestinian Authority-controlled Gaza
today, marking the first time a US president has set foot in
Palestinian territory. He is to oversee a reaffirmation of the 1996
Palestinian National Council vote to annul parts of the founding
charter that call for the destruction of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   As a crush of young people pushed toward Clinton after the
speech, Karen Halperin, 17, who described herself as being from a
``very religious family'' from Jerusalem, said she was inspired by
Clinton's ``beautiful words.''
</P>
<P>
   But as she watched the young people clamoring to shake hands
with Clinton, she said: ``I don't think peace is possible. As long
as they'' _ the Palestinians _ ``are committed to killing us, and
talk about Israel as if it has no right to exist, I don't think we
will see peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's speech stood in stark contrast to a preceding one by
Netanyahu, who adopted a lecturing tone, offering what he called
``an education for peace.''
</P>
<P>
   The speeches differed more than in tone. They seemed to
underscore the differences between the two leaders, whose
relationship has been strained in the past. The Clinton
administration openly favored former Prime Minister Shimon Peres in
the 1996 election, which he lost to Netanyahu. And Clinton's visit
Sunday to the grave of the slain prime minister, Yitzhak Rabin,
where he placed a stone from the Wye River, was a reminder of how
closely the two had worked together to achieve the 1993 Oslo
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Netanyahu had warm words Sunday about the ``special
relationship'' between the United States and Israel. But the
political careers of both men are at stake, and to some extent the
further implementation of Wye will affect them in opposite ways.
Success in moving on peace would help Clinton's image back home.
Hard-liners in Netanyahu's coalition are threatening to bring down
his government if he cedes more West Bank land, as called for.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu said that Israel must receive a guarantee that the
Palestinians will live up to their end of the Wye agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In speaking to the students, Netanyahu's phrases about ``our
counterparts,'' as he referred to the Palestinians, were spiked
with images of fear. He described Palestinian textbooks that did
not include the state of Israel in maps of the region. He told the
students: ``Palestinians go to Tel Aviv freely.'' But he asked
them, ominously. ``Can one of you enter Gaza?''
</P>
<P>
   Hani Sand, 17, from Jerusalem, said, ``I think Clinton was
talking to us to help his political future. And I think Netanyahu
was talking to the Knesset to help his political future.''

EDITORIAL: THE SCIENCE OF SILICONE IMPLANTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Dec. 14:
</P>
<P>
   A court-appointed panel of experts has concluded that existing
scientific evidence does not show a link between silicone breast
implants and systemic disease.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Judge Sam Pointer Jr., who is overseeing breast-implant
lawsuits in the federal courts, convened the panel to advise him on
medical evidence surrounding implants. His approach was unusual in
that he sought expert testimony independent of either side in the
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy may also be useful in other complex cases where
juries and judges are forced to choose between battling experts who
may be biased.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers from both sides will now have the opportunity to
question the expert panelists in depositions and to use that
testimony in implant trials. The findings should make trials
somewhat easier to conduct, and may cause more plaintiffs to settle
their claims against the implant manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Well before the panel's report, thousands of cases had been
settled. Last month, Dow Corning Corp., once the leading maker of
silicone implants, and representatives of implant plaintiffs
formally agreed to a plan that will pay some 170,000 claimants $3.2
billion over 15 years for suffering and the costs of implant
removal. Both sides decided that it was better financially to make
a deal than to fight out the science in court.
</P>
<P>
   The new report, which will not affect that settlement, puts
forward solid conclusions based on multiple studies. But the
panel's findings do not represent the last word on implant safety.
A National Cancer Institute study of 13,500 women who have had
implants is looking at the long-term health impacts. Results from
that study will not be available until next year.
</P>
<P>
   A panel convened by the Institute of Medicine, an arm of the
National Academy of Sciences, is also continuing to review the
medical evidence. The report from Pointer's panel shows how much is
known. Other scientists are still researching aspects of implants
that are not yet known.

ALABAMA SCHOOL PAPERS ALSO SERVE COMMUNITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Ga., N.C., Tenn.)  (rl) 
 By BERNARD STAMLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   They are not the kinds of articles you would expect in a high
school newspaper. But in the Alabama towns of Notasulga (population
925), Gaylesville (149) and Oakman (836), articles on murder, sex
offenders and community politics are as likely to appear in the
student journals as pictures of the homecoming queen.
</P>
<P>
   The schools in all of these towns _ as well as in 18 others in
the state _ are members of Pacers, a cooperative organized by the
University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa to nurture rural schools and
the communities they serve.
</P>
<P>
   And in a state where small towns have been hit hard by
urbanization and school consolidation, and where hundreds of local
newspapers have gone out of business in the last few decades, some
high school papers have become the only means, short of gossip, for
communicating local news.
</P>
<P>
   ``These schools are the linchpins of their communities,'' said
Jim Wrye, program manager for Pacers, which is short for Program
for the Academic and Cultural Enhancement of Rural Schools. ``And
these newspapers get people in the loop.''
</P>
<P>
   Students working on the papers receive a brief period of
training at the university, Wrye said.
</P>
<P>
   The training is largely paid for by a grant from the Lyndhurst
Foundation, a broad-based charitable organization in Chattanooga,
Tenn. But the operations of the school papers are expected to be
self-sustaining. ``The kids do everything,'' Wrye said, ``writing
stories, selling ads, managing the business.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the school newspapers, which are published monthly, have
resurrected the nameplates of the commercial papers _ The Oakman
Times and The Gaylesville Enterprise, for example _ that are now
defunct but used to serve their communities. People take comfort in
the continuity, Wrye said.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Boman, an English teacher, is faculty adviser to The
Notasulga Times, which is published by a high school staff of 16 at
the 620-student Notasulga School. The paper and the school, which
is attended by kindergartners through 12th graders, serve the
23,000 residents of Macon County. The closest daily newspaper, The
Opelika-Auburn News, is aimed at communities 15 to 20 miles away in
Lee County.
</P>
<P>
   ``The student paper is terribly important to the community,''
where most employment is in clerical, factory or farm work, Ms.
Boman said. ``No one else covers us.'' She said that The Notasulga
Times received no money from the school, but carried enough local
ads to break even on its annual budget of about $6,000.
</P>
<P>
   Students at the school papers often go on to study journalism at
the university, and serve as mentors to the papers they left, Wrye
said. He hopes to get every rural school in Alabama to join Pacers
in the next few years, and plans similar programs in North
Carolina, Tennessee and Georgia.

SAMARANCH PROMISES ACTION ON I.O.C. BRIBERY CHARGES
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   LAUSANNE, Switzerland _ Saying ``if we have to clean, we will
clean,'' Juan Antonio Samaranch responded on Sunday to allegations
of corruption in the Olympic bidding process by declaring that IOC
members who were found to have accepted bribes from candidate
cities could be expelled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a serious problem we have before us,'' Samaranch,
president of the International Olympic Committee, said in a hastily
arranged news conference at a tumultuous meeting of the IOC
executive board.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch compared the current climate to the Soviet boycott of
the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles and the sprinter Ben Johnson's
expulsion from the 1988 Olympics in Seoul, South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those were difficult moments,'' Samaranch said. ``Now we are
facing another difficult moment, but I'm sure we will solve this
problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch expressed surprise at allegations made by the IOC
executive board member Marc Hodler of Switzerland that agents were
offering to sell I.O.C. members' votes for payments from bidding
cities.
</P>
<P>
   Hodler, the second most senior member of the IOC, said Saturday
that he knew of four agents, including one IOC member, who engaged
in such activities. Hodler said he believed that 5 to 7 percent of
the IOC membership, which currently numbers 115, asked for some
sort of compensation for their vote.
</P>
<P>
   He has called for a new electoral process, in which the
executive board or some other select IOC group would decide which
cities become Olympic hosts instead of the full IOC membership.
Samaranch agreed Sunday that the time had come to explore change.
``The system we have now is very complicated, very slow and very
expensive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hodler, the former head of the International Ski Federation,
also claimed that the Fiat tycoon Gianni Agnelli had given free
vans to influence votes for the Italian resort of Sestriere to hold
the 1997 world skiing championships. Fiat denied the claims on
Saturday, but Sunday Howard Peterson, a former senior American
delegate to the ski federation, said he had been offered cars by
two Fiat executives.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of vote-buying came to the fore in Lausanne because of
the recent disclosure of scholarship payments made to six relatives
of IOC members by Salt Lake City officials during their successful
bid to play host to the 2002 Winter Games. The Salt Lake Organizing
Committee has said the payments, which amounted to slightly less
than $400,000, came from a privately financed fund that was started
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   And Intermountain Health Care, Utah's largest health care
provider, confirmed Sunday that it gave free surgical services to
at least two people associated with the IOC in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   A special commission headed by the IOC vice president Dick Pound
was appointed on Friday to investigate the issue and has met with
Salt Lake officials. Sunday, Frank Joklik, president of the Salt
Lake Organizing Committee, issued a public apology to the ``Olympic
family and the citizens of Utah'' for the embarrassment caused by
the scholarships program.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch Sunday ruled out taking the Games from Salt Lake City.
He said, ``If necessary we will expel members if this ad hoc
commission thinks these members are guilty.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound said his commission was already ``satisfied Salt Lake City
won the 2002 Games on the merit of the bid.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said that his commission would expand its inquiry beyond
the Salt Lake City bid only if it was presented with evidence and
not simply rumors of corruption in other bids. On Saturday, Hodler
had suggested the bidding teams from Atlanta and Nagano, Japan,
that won the 1996 Summer Olympics and 1998 Winter Olympics had not
run ``clean'' campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Payne, who presided over Atlanta's bid, and Makoto
Kobayashi, the general secretary of the Nagano organizing
committee, denied those claims. Asked whether he regretted his
statements Sunday, Hodler said, ``Not at all'' and later said that
``the cities have been the victims and not the villains.''
</P>
<P>
   Pound said there had been concern in the IOC for some time about
agents. ``There always have been lobbyists,'' he said. ``In recent
years, especially with the Olympics coming up every two years,
there seems to be a professional class being created.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodler, when pressed for further comment this afternoon at
Olympic headquarters, initially covered his mouth with both hands
and then said, ``Muzzle imposed by the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Hodler, 80, is one of only four IOC members with life membership
because he was appointed before age limits were imposed in 1966.
Asked if he might resign he said, ``I'm not going to resign, but I
might be expelled.''
</P>
<P>
   But the 78-year-old Samaranch said he had ``great respect'' for
Hodler and no intention of asking for his resignation or pushing
for his expulsion.

37 AMERICANS WIN BRITISH SCHOLARSHIPS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three New York students are among this year's winners
of the British Marshall Scholarships, it is being announced Monday
by the British ambassador, Sir Christopher Meyer.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the three, Tara Helfman and her classmate Joseph Stern,

CONNECTICUT OFFICIALS SAY DEAL REACHED ON PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD _ Moving ever closer to providing a new home for the
New England Patriots, Connecticut Governor John G. Rowland and six
ranking legislative leaders Sunday said they had reached an
agreement on the terms of a $375 million stadium financing deal.
</P>
<P>
   All predicted the General Assembly will approve the deal
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Their renewed confidence hung on new language in the proposal,
which will make it even tougher for the Patriots to leave
Connecticut and decrease the state's exposure on premium seating
guarantees by $4 million annually. After reviewing those details,
Rowland and the legislators emerged from the Governor's Mansion and
said the deal is largely done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all standing here, our bipartisan leadership, in total
agreement on this stadium proposal, in total agreement on the
legislation that we will present,'' Rowland said. ``We all have a
proposal now that we can move forward with, and I think it's going
to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic legislators _ including House Speaker Thomas D.
Ritter of Hartford, Senate President Pro Tem Kevin B. Sullivan of
West Hartford, and even a stubborn skeptic, House Majority Leader
Moira Lyons of Stamford _ echoed the governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased with the changes, I think they have been
significant changes,'' said Lyons, making her first announcement
that she will vote in favor of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am usually skeptical about making predictions, but, for the
first time today, I think I feel confident that it will pass in the
Senate,'' said Sullivan. ``I think that what we can say to our
colleagues is that we listened to them, we took their issues back
to the conversation and got results. More importantly, what our
colleagues can say to their constituents is that we listened to
you, too, and we made the changes you need to see in this deal to
make it best for Connecticut.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Patriots owner Robert Kraft and his son Jonathan were
not available for comment Sunday, because of the team's upset loss
to the St. Louis Rams and the beginning of Hanukkah, Rowland said
they were in agreement with the changes.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said the new provisions resulted from ``concessions
and agreements with the Kraft family and the team,'' and that he
had merely informed Robert Kraft of the positive response of
legislators in a 10-minute telephone call to St. Louis Sunday
during the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very pleased with the response of the Krafts in allaying
our concerns,'' Rowland said. ``Many expected us to come to some
movement on the guarantees and we have done so, which makes this
product a lot more palatable to the legislators on Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   In a proposed bill released last week, Kraft and the Patriots
would have been bound to Connecticut for the duration of a 30-year
lease on the new stadium through a legal declaration that moving
the team would have presented an ``irreparable harm'' to the state,
for which it could not be compensated by money or any other means.
Rowland's office and legislative staff saw the so-called exit
provisions as ironclad, essentially laying out a legally
enforceable position from which the Patriots could not withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland and the legislative leaders announced Sunday that the
bill will now call on the Patriots to pay the state for all of the
benefits the team has received and the state has derived from the
stadium if the Krafts ever sell the team or leave the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to make sure that the taxpayers' interest was
protected over the next 30 years should the Patriots decide to
leave, and the exit agreement is very, very stiff,'' Rowland said.
``If they were to leave in any way, shape or form, or sell the
team, the penalty for them would be the total value or total
benefit to the state. So that runs up into the hundreds and
hundreds of million dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill also had formulated state guarantees for luxury boxes
and club seats that would have essentially required the state to
pay for some of the premium seating that the Patriots could not
sell.
</P>
<P>
   The state's maximum exposure over the first 10 years of the
agreement was $17.5 million per year, and Rowland said Sunday that
the Patriots had been provided with language that could have
extended some of the guarantees over the 30 years. Those guarantees
made the deal one of the most lucrative offered to an NFL owner,
and they have been among the provisions most criticized by the
legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland and the legislative leaders said Sunday that they had
agreed with Kraft to lower the total annual exposure to $13
million.
</P>
<P>
   Under the first draft of the bill and the memorandum of
understanding Rowland and Kraft signed on Nov. 19, the state would
have been responsible for 4,000 of the 6,000 club seats at 50
percent of the $5,000 price tag . Connecticut also would have been
responsible for the full cost of 75 of the 125 to 150 luxury
suites, which are to sell at $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   As reported in the Globe Sunday, the final bill will reduce the
cost of the club seats to $4,000. That reduces the state's exposure
by $2 million per year, Rowland and the legislative leaders said.
</P>
<P>
   The state will now guarantee only 50 percent of the cost of the
last 75 to 100 luxury suites for sale, a savings of $2.5 million on
the potential cost of the guarantee, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is going to be very helpful to legislators who
were either on the fence or perhaps wanted to vote for this plan
but felt that the guarantees were too much of a risk for the
state,'' Rowland said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Patriots could have imposed the guarantees over the
lifetime of the lease, Rowland said, the potential savings to the
state are substantial.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at it over a period of 30 years, if you look at
the inflation and the increase of the ticket prices over 30 years,
that reduces the exposure of the guarantees by as much as $350
million,'' Rowland said.
</P>
<P>
   The legislators met with Rowland and some members of his staff
for about four hours Sunday before announcing the agreement. All
said they will speak to their Democratic and Republican caucuses,
and will push today for approval of the bill in its new form.

LATEST `TREK' VOYAGE BEAMS INTO FIRST PLACE AT BOX OFFICE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- ``Star Trek: Insurrection'' vaporized the
competition at the nation's multiplexes as it dominated the U.S.
box office with an estimated $22.4 million at 2,620 theaters during
the Friday-Sunday period, studio sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The results gave ``Insurrection'' the third-highest opening
among the nine ``Trek'' films, trailing 1996's $30.7 million debut
for ``First Contact'' and 1994's $23 million start for
``Generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Prospects look respectable for the Paramount project, set on a
fountain-of-youth planet with the cast of the ``Star Trek: The Next
Generation'' TV series, with a final gross of $78 million,
according to Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source
service.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Insurrection' will stay in the top 10 for quite a while,''
Bucksbaum said. ``It's getting positive word of mouth, critics
liked it and it has a softer feel so it may draw more women than
usual.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The `Star Trek' franchise is still solid,'' said film industry
analyst Arthur Rockwell. ``I think everyone expected this kind of
opening.''
</P>
<P>
   Paramount distribution chief Wayne Lewellan said
``Insurrection'' was drawing well among men and is well positioned
among upcoming holiday movies, with a majority of the major
releases aimed at families (``The Prince of Egypt,'' ``Mighty Joe
Young'') and women (``You've Got Mail,'' ``Stepmom''). ``You know
with `Star Trek' that you'll have the core audience of fans, so the
task is to go past that,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trek'' films, launched in 1979, have grossed nearly $600
million domestically, led by ``The Voyage Home,'' the fourth
installment, with $112 million in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's fourth weekend of ``A Bug's Life'' finished second with
$11 million at 2,748 theaters as the computer-animated comedy
declined 36 percent from the previous Friday-Sunday. ``Life'' now
has $83.3 million and should continue to draw well through the
holiday season.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's other major opening, Warner Bros.' family comedy
``Jack Frost,'' posted lukewarm returns with $6.9 million at 2,152
screens. Bucksbaum said the results, coming amid strong holdover
competition, underscored the overall strength of the family market.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows there's plenty of room for family films during the
holiday season,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   A trio of holdovers performed solidly -- Disney's fourth weekend
of ``Enemy of the State'' with $6.5 million at 2,517 sites,
Paramount's fourth weekend of ``The Rugrats Movie'' with $4.5
million at 2,706 theaters and Disney's sixth weekend of ``The
Waterboy'' with $4.3 million at 2,610 locations. ``The Waterboy''
has grossed $136.4 million and ranks 76th on the all-time domestic
box office list after ``Platoon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney is just dominating this season,'' Rockwell noted.
</P>
<P>
   Universal continued its dismal performance as its ``Psycho''
remake plunged from second to seventh with $3.8 million at 2,490
theaters, losing an astounding 62 percent of its opening weekend
audience. The thriller looks unlikely to match its estimated $25
million budget.
</P>
<P>
   Two high-priced Universal projects nearly vanished -- the fifth
weekend of ``Meet Joe Black'' with $1.63 million at 1,870 screens
and the third weekend of ``Babe: Pig in the City'' with $1.6
million at 2,240 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe'' has totaled $41.5 million while the ``Babe'' sequel has
reached only $13.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the top 10 was Gramercy's ``Elizabeth'' with $1.3
million at 555 theaters. Universal's parent Seagram Co. acquired
Gramercy last week as part of its $10.4 billion buyout of recorded
music giant PolyGram and has not yet indicated if it will sell
PolyGram's movie operations.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of well-reviewed Academy Award contenders posted solid
openings in limited release -- Paramount's ``A Simple Plan'' with
$400,000 at 31 theaters and Miramax's ``Shakespeare in Love'' with
$215,000 at eight screens.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the box office took in $76 million, down 18 percent
from the same 1997 weekend when ``Scream 2'' opened with $32.9
million. Year-to-date grosses have hit $6.4 billion, up 10 percent
over the same 1997 period, and the outlook is bright for the year's
final 2{ weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The slate is certainly as good as it was a year ago with a lot
of diversity,'' Rockwell said. ``There's something out there for
everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum predicted ``The Prince of Egypt'' will open next
weekend with $28 million and take in $120 million overall, adding,
``It's a unique movie that we think is going to open up the field
of animation.'' Warner's comedy ``You've Got Mail'' should open
with $25 million, according to Bucksbaum.

OFFENSE SHOWS FIRE, NO POWER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Last week in New Orleans, it was about ``want
to.'' Here yesterday, the Cowboys simply ``couldn't.'' As in win.
</P>
<P>
   On the football manhood scale, there is a large difference in
the two. In the NFL standings, however, both were registered as
L's.
</P>
<P>
   Applaud no team for the act of showing up and playing hard, but
the stark contrast from one week to the next was noticeable, which
makes last week even more shameful.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys in New Orleans were a disgrace to franchise
heritage. As opposed to the Cowboys at Arrowhead Stadium, who were
a struggling, injury-depleted offensive outfit that finally located
the long-lost end zone in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Yanking out a victory after three quarters of despair even
became a reality. But the Cowboys' defense had two different
fourth-quarter chances to make possession stops on the Chiefs, and
couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   KC by 20-17 sent the Cowboys tumbling to their third consecutive
defeat. They are going backward in December, as the record slipped
to 8-6. To the rest of the league, they are a playoff-bound NFC
East joke. At the moment, there is no rebuttal, either.
</P>
<P>
   But first things first. ``We played a lot harder than last week
_ in their hearts, they responded today,'' said coach Chan Gailey,
who was disappointed, yet almost strangely confident in his
postgame demeanor. A week ago, Gailey's mood alternated between
shell shock and anger as he had tried to explain his team's New
Orleans farce.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least we didn't quit like last week,'' admitted fullback
Daryl Johnston.
</P>
<P>
   A media-type mentioned to Johnston that Fox voice John Madden
was on TV labeling the Cowboys as ``too old.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnston sat up on his locker-room stool and responded tersely,
``Three weeks ago, after the Minnesota game, everybody was calling
us the hottest offensive team in the league. And we were. So now,
two games later, we're suddenly too old? That doesn't make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Good answer. But for a multitude of other questions, the Cowboys
have few if any answers. This is an offense that went seven
consecutive quarters without a touchdown, and produced six points
in that span.
</P>
<P>
   And what ails the Cowboys at the moment is all about offense. It
was last week in New Orleans, and here again yesterday. The defense
hangs in enough to give Dallas a chance to win, but winning for the
Cowboys, as with most NFL teams of this era, is all about offense.
</P>
<P>
   Injuries are only an offensive excuse, although a legitimate
excuse.
</P>
<P>
   Forget Deion Sanders being out, plus Kevin Smith. Young
replacement corners Charlie Williams and Kevin Mathis did good work
yesterday against a Chiefs offense that had thrown its way to three
consecutive games of 30-plus points.
</P>
<P>
   Where the defense had a breakdown was stopping Bam Morris. He
rumbled along for 137 yards rushing, in the process chewing up the
likes of Leon Lett, who has lost his all-world status.
</P>
<P>
   But still, the Cowboys should be winning games when the
opposition scores 20 points off the defense in two consecutive
games. But the offense has put up 20 combined points in the last
two losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably the most surprised,'' said Gailey when asked
about the offensive woes. Later, he added, ``There is no doubt in
my mind we will get it turned around.''
</P>
<P>
   Not, however, without better health. Michael Irvin missed the
second half yesterday with a back injury. That meant the Cowboys'
top two receivers, Irvin and Ernie Mills, were not available, with
Mills, of course, gone for the season. Add to that list tight end
David LaFleur, who sat out this one after being injured in New
Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Aikman was missing favorite targets as the fourth-quarter
comeback started. The opposition doesn't have to show normal
respect for the air game, so has that lead to the sudden
ground-game drought? Or is it vice versa?
</P>
<P>
   Emmitt Smith was going nowhere again yesterday, because there
was nowhere to go. Unlike New Orleans, the Chiefs didn't blitz both
Aikman and Emmitt into submission. Kansas City played it basically
straight on defense, and won the line-of-scrimmage battle.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys couldn't establish the run early, and after two
critical second-half turnovers led to a 17-3 deficit, the run went
out of the game plan. Without LaFleur, the Cowboys' ``strong-side''
blocking (the side where the tight end lines up) is almost
nonexistent. This is the bread-and-butter area for a running game.
Yesterday, it wasn't available. The same goes for last week.
</P>
<P>
   Very quietly, LaFleur, who is due back Sunday, had become a key
to both run and pass success. And tight end is the one area of the
team where depth doesn't exist.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, however, the Cowboys' offensive line has had its
butt kicked for two weeks. Three weeks if you count the lack of a
ground game against Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Will this change? Will the offense suddenly become productive
again? ``It will,'' predicted Gailey. For now, we'll just have to
take his word for it.

JEFFERS GETS THE CALL IN THE SECOND HALF
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS AND CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ With top receiver Michael Irvin sidelined in
the second quarter with a lower back contusion, former Country Day
star Patrick Jeffers emerged as the Cowboys' go-to guy late in
yesterday's 20-17 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffers, who had no receptions in the first half, appeared to be
an unlikely candidate for the job.
</P>
<P>
   But with Chiefs 5-foot-7 cornerback Mark McMillan guarding the
6-3 Jeffers for much of the second half, the Cowboys figured it was
their best matchup.
</P>
<P>
   The plan proved to be good one _ although a tad too late.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffers sparked two touchdown drives with five catches in the
second half for 74 yards, including a 28-yard scoring reception.
MIXED RESULTS
</P>
<P>
   Tyrone Hughes, signed two weeks ago as a kickoff returner,
contributed to the outcome, in a good way and bad.
</P>
<P>
   The good: Helped by Robert Thomas' big block, Hughes scooted
down the left side for a 35-yard punt return in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The play gave the Cowboys the ball at the Chiefs' 32-yard line.
Seven plays later, Richie Cunningham kicked a 32-yard field goal to
tie the score at 3-3.
</P>
<P>
   The bad: Hughes fumbled after a 12-yard punt return in the third
quarter. The Chiefs got the ball at midfield and eventually turned
the possession into a 1-yard touchdown run by Bam Morris. This gave
the Chiefs a 10-3 lead with 4:01 to go in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The four-point swing may or may not cost Hughes his job. When
Hughes was signed, coach Chan Gailey said his longevity with the
team would be looked at week-to-week.
IRVIN BANGED UP
</P>
<P>
   Irvin will get X-rays for the lower back contusion he suffered
in the first half. Irvin, who missed the second half, landed
awkwardly on his buttocks area after he was hit hard by Chiefs
cornerback Dale Carter late in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Although he was walking gingerly around the Cowboys locker room,
the Cowboys listed him as day-to-day, pending the X-rays.
</P>
<P>
   Team physician Robert Vandermeer said he did not know if Irvin's
injury was as serious as that of Kevin Smith's, who has missed the
past 2 1/2 games with a similar injury.
SANDERS CAN'T GO
</P>
<P>
   Cornerback Deion Sanders missed his third consecutive game with
a sprained left big toe. Sanders wanted to play, but Gailey decided
to hold him out one more week.
</P>
<P>
   `He wants to play,'' Gailey said, ``We just felt like at the
percentage he was ready to go tonight jeopardized him too much for
re-injury. I thought it was best that we not play him.''
SPECIAL-TEAMS MISHAP
</P>
<P>
   For the first time this decade, the Cowboys special teams unit
allowed a blocked punt in a regular-season game.
</P>
<P>
   That broke a club-record of 611 consecutive punts without having
one blocked. The last time they had a punt blocked in a
regular-season game was nine years ago to the day. On Dec. 16, 1989
the Giants' Dwayne Jiles managed to block one.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday, Chiefs tight end Brian Roche raced through the middle
of the line to block Toby Gowin's punt. Gowin made a touchdown
saving tackle by lowering his head and ``driving'' Tony Richardson,
who recovered the ball for the Chiefs, out of bounds with 29
seconds left in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys did not allow a point, however, as the Chiefs ran
out of time before their field-goal unit could attempt a kick.
BRIEFLY
</P>
<P>
   Sign of the times? Rookie free agent Rob Thomas rotated with
Fred Strickland at middle linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Irvin's one-yard gain on a lateral in the second quarter
counted as a handoff, his first since carrying two times for six
yards at Arizona on Sept. 19, 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Tony Hutson was in for a few plays at right guard in the first
half when Nate Newton sprained his ankle.

EARLY OFFENSIVE FAILURE DOOMS COWBOYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Cowboys finished the game with two
touchdowns in the final 15 minutes yesterday. But it is the first
45 minutes of offense that conspired to send this club to its third
consecutive defeat of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys had as many punts, six, as first downs in the first
three quarters of a 20-17 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs. In the
last two weeks, the Cowboys have averaged 10 points per game. They
averaged 27 points per game over the first 12 weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm probably the most surprised to be honest with you,'' Chan
Gailey said. ``I thought things were going well and all of a sudden
we hit a stretch where we couldn't do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The absence of blocking tight end David LaFleur, who injured his
knee last week, derailed the running game. Emmitt Smith had few
holes and finished with 42 yards on 14 carries.
</P>
<P>
   The inability of the Cowboys wide receivers to consistently beat
the Chiefs cornerbacks in man-to-man coverage cost them in the
passing game. To be sure, the Cowboys did play the entire second
half without Michael Irvin, who injured his back. But Irvin had
nothing to do with four first half dropped passes, or Troy Aikman's
third quarter interception that put the Cowboys in a two touchdown
hole from which they could never recover.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of the third quarter, Aikman had tried to go deep
down the left sideline to Patrick Jeffers, who was covered by Mark
McMillian. Chiefs safety Jerome Woods, however, raced over from the
middle of the field for the interception with 3:34 remaining in the
third quarter. Six plays later, the Chiefs had a 17-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were jamming our guys, getting physical and we saw it and
figured we had to take a shot,'' said Aikman, who was 18 of 35 for
199 yards. ``The safety was in the middle and he made up ground. I
should have tried to hold him up a little better. I didn't think he
could get over and make a play on the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys running game suffered because they could not be
versatile in their play calling. LaFleur's replacement on the
strongside of the Cowboys attack, Hayward Clay, lacks experience as
a run-blocker. The Cowboys ran just three times to the strongside,
running backs coach Clarence Shelmon said. The Chiefs noticed that
the Cowboys were running mainly up the middle or away from Clay's
side and were easily able to load up to hold the Cowboys to 51
yards on 16 carries.
</P>
<P>
   The Chiefs would not have been able to load up against the run
had the Cowboys passing game provided consistent pressure. With
simple man-to-man coverage Chiefs cornerbacks Dale Carter and James
Hasty held the Cowboys receivers to four receptions for 36 yards
through the game's first 45 minutes. Irvin had just one catch for
nine yards before he was hurt. Patrick Jeffers, Jeff Ogden, and
Eric Bjornson combined to drop four passes in the first 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got good cornerbacks who were just squatting right
where we wanted to make breaks in our routes,'' Jeffers said.
``They were very physical. We needed to take it to them a little
more.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys did take it to them in the fourth quarter. Jeffers
and Smith caught touchdown passes. But, said Gailey, ``it was too
little, too late.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Morris K. Udall of Arizona, a liberal conscience of the House of
Representatives for 30 years and a tireless advocate for
environmental protection and political reform, died late Saturday
in Washington. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   Udall died of complications arising from Parkinson's disease,
according to Terrence Bracy, chairman of the Morris K. Udall
Foundation in Tucson, Ariz. First diagnosed in 1980, the disease
led to Udall's resignation from Congress in 1991. He spent the
final stage of his life in a veterans hospital in Washington,
seldom conscious.
</P>
<P>
   Udall was one of those rare figures on the Washington scene who
flourished despite the fact that his politics frequently did not
square with the views held by many of his constituents, who were
known for their support of conservative issues and Sen. Barry
Goldwater. But from the time Udall was first elected in 1961 in
Arizona's 2nd Congressional District until his retirement, they
voted for him in overwhelming numbers and they did not seem to care
that he earned high marks from organizations like the Americans for
Democratic Action and the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   Arizonans identified with Udall's unabashed love of unspoiled
nature, and they applauded his efforts to create safeguards for the
environment, including curbs on strip mining and legislation to
protect more than 100 million acres of wilderness in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   Udall's supporters came to believe in the 1970s that the
6-foot-5-inch, one-time basketball player for the Denver Nuggets
might be a viable candidate for president. Udall believed it, too,
hoping that his reputation for honesty and rugged integrity would
help him become the nation's first elected post-Watergate
president. But in 1976 he finished second in six Democratic
primaries, losing the nomination to Gov. Jimmy Carter of Georgia.
His liberal positions, among them proposals to break up the large
oil companies and to set up a national health insurance program,
were considered too extreme by some elements in his party and he
lacked the name recognition and money to finance his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Udall considered running again in 1980, because he did not
believe that Carter could defeat Ronald Reagan. But mindful of
questions about the state of his health, he threw his support to
Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. He had disclosed that he had
Parkinson's disease, a progressive disorder that typically occurs
in middle age or beyond and is often characterized by tremors,
stiffness of muscles and a deterioration of certain functions of
the brain. Despite his condition, Udall remained active in the
House for another decade.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, he continued to be in the vanguard of those who
insisted that the environment be protected from industry, opposing
oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. The
coastal plain of the refuge was thought to be especially rich in
oil but Udall, who served as chairman of the House Interior
Committee, called it ``a sacred place'' that should never be
invaded by oil rigs.
</P>
<P>
   He was also a leader in the fight to push a tough strip-mining
bill through the House in the 1970s. The bill was vetoed twice by
President Gerald Ford before it passed in 1977 and became one of
the pioneering pieces of environmental legislation, reclaiming
millions of acres of coal land.
</P>
<P>
   In his years in Congress he was in the forefront of efforts to
protect the environment, expand the national parks system and
restructure the energy industry; in recognition, the National
Wildlife Federation named him its legislator of the year in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963 he proposed legislation to put cigarettes and other
tobacco products under the control of the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration. He favored putting the federal government on a
pay-as-you-go basis and slashing the federal debt, and he promoted
major legislation in postal reform and land-use planning.
</P>
<P>
   He worked overtime to reform the way the House does business.
From the start he disclosed his finances and put his income tax
returns in open files. He gave up his lucrative law practice
entirely and did not keep outside sources of income, as do many
congressmen. He fought for financial disclosure legislation and
campaign-reform laws. He proposed curbs on lobbyists.
</P>
<P>
   He played a key role in drafting and passing the Federal
Election Campaign Act of 1971, the first substantial revision of
campaign financing laws since 1925. The law, which required
candidates for federal office to file detailed reports on the money
they raised and spent, was used to help expose the Watergate
scandal in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Udall also took on the powerful committee chairmen who
controlled Congress under the seniority system. He wanted to break
up the old-boy network by allowing the top three ranking members on
each House committee to be eligible for the chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Morris King Udall was born June 15, 1922, in St. John's, Ariz.,
the son of Levi and Louise Lee Udall. One of his great-grandfathers
had led the first Mormons into Arizona from Utah. His father
started out digging ditches, achieved success as a farmer, took
law-school correspondence courses and served for 16 years on the
Arizona Supreme Court, for a part of that time as its highly
regarded chief justice. Udall's mother was the author of ``Mine and
Me,'' the story of a Hopi woman's life.
</P>
<P>
   Levi Udall stressed to his children the need for responsible
people to enter public service. Morris had two brothers and two
sisters. One of his brothers, Stewart, was elected to Congress from
Arizona's 2nd Congressional District and served until he resigned
to become secretary of the interior in the Cabinet of President
John F. Kennedy. ``Stew's little brother'' Mo won the special
election to fill his seat.
</P>
<P>
   As a boy, Mo Udall had more than his share of adversity. When he
was 5, his right eye was accidentally injured by a playmate. At
that point, Levi Udall was still struggling and did not have enough
money to obtain decent medical care for his son. Morris Udall later
recalled being taken to a doctor in St. John's who, he said, was
``mostly drunk'' and who recommended that the eye be treated with
poultices. Soon, the eye became infected and it was lost. Udall
said the experience help mold his sense of social consciousness and
he fought for the right of all Americans to consult with qualified
physicians without respect to their ability to pay.
</P>
<P>
   When in later life Udall talked about any of his problems, it
was always with self-deprecating wit and no illness could change
that. ``I'm a one-eyed Mormon Democrat from conservative Arizona
and you can't have a higher handicap than that,'' he would say.

 UNDATED: would say. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After graduation from high school in 1940, Udall entered the
University of Arizona, but after the United States entered World
War II, he maneuvered his way into the Army despite the loss of his
eye. In fact, he recalled, it was at Fort Sam Houston that he got
his first decent glass eye; it not only fit, but the color matched,
as well.
</P>
<P>
   He served as commander of an all-black squadron in Louisiana for
two years. ``That really shaped my life,'' he later said. ``I
fought their fights with them. We had some battles over local
discrimination.'' He served in the South Pacific and achieved the
rank of captain in the Army Air Corps.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, he returned to the University of Arizona, where he was
voted president of the student body and starred as co-captain and
all-conference forward with the basketball team. After completing
his undergraduate work, he played briefly with the Denver Nuggets.
</P>
<P>
   But his athletic career was set aside in 1949, after his
admission to the bar. He returned to Arizona, set up a law practice
with his brother Stewart and entered politics. He was elected chief
deputy attorney for Pima County in 1950 and three years later was
elected county attorney. He suffered a setback in 1954 when he
failed to win a nomination for a Superior Court judgeship. But in
1961, he succeeded his brother in Congress and became a leading
liberal voice there for the next three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Larry King, the writer, once described the lanky Udall's arrival
at the Capitol: ``There was about him a disconcerting combination
of painful country-boy shyness and a bawdy cow-lot humor.''
</P>
<P>
   Udall prided himself on his independence and outspokenness. In
1967, he broke with colleagues in the House who wanted to unseat
Rep. Adam Clayton Powell, D-N.Y. Udall said it would be an
injustice to Powell's constituents. That same year, he returned to
hawkish Arizona and made a speech in Tucson in which he said he had
erred in supporting American involvement in the war in Vietnam. His
experiences in World War II led him to cease being an active member
of the Mormon church. Citing the church's policy of not allowing
black people to become priests (which it has since rescinded), he
said, ``For more than 25 years I have held and expressed a
deep-seated and conscientious disagreement with the church doctrine
on the role of blacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his career, Udall was always regarded as a formidable
parliamentary tactician and an astute politician. But he failed in
his efforts to oust John McCormack of Massachusetts as speaker of
the House in 1969, when McCormack was 77 and tiring but still too
formidable for anyone else to dare challenge him. And he failed
also in a bid in 1970 to oust Hale Boggs of Louisiana as House
majority leader. When he lost to Boggs, after promised support from
some liberals failed to materialize, he turned his ``Mo'' campaign
button upside down so it read ``Ow.''
</P>
<P>
   Udall was married to Patricia Emery from 1949 until their
divorce in 1966. They had six children: Mark, Randolph, Judith,
Anne, Bradley and Katherine. He married Ella Royston in 1968. She
committed suicide 20 years later. In 1989, he married Norma
Gilbert. He is survived by his wife; four brothers and sisters,
Stewart of Santa Fe, N.M., David of Tucson, Elma of Albuquerque,
N.M., and Eloise Whiting of Albuquerque; six children, Mark of
Boulder, Colo., Randolph of Carbondale, Colo., Judith Udall Harding
of Boulder, Anne Udall of Charlotte, N.C., Bradley of Eagle, Colo.,
and Katherine Udall of Norman, Okla., and seven grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Udall's son Mark was elected to the House of Representatives
from Boulder this year. A nephew, Tom Udall, won a House seat from
Santa Fe, in the same election.
</P>
<P>
   Udall resigned from the House after a fall in his home in
Arlington, Va., in 1991. But he had decided even before that, he
said, that he could not be a candidate for office in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   In his honor, Congress in 1992 established the Morris K. Udall
Foundation, which is dedicated to environmental education and
mediation.
</P>
<P>
   Before illness took its toll, Udall liked to write and took
pleasure in creating his own newsletters to his constituents. Some
of his newsletters, which were distinctive because they were devoid
of self-promotion and concentrated on voter education, were
published in book form in 1972 under the title, ``The Education of
a Congressman.'' His witticisms were the subject of another book,
``Too Funny to be President,'' published after his unsuccessful bid
for president in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Udall's humor was appreciated in Washington and Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the House Post Office Committee, he would joke:
``Let's turn inflation over to the Post Office. That'll slow it
down.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was running his modest campaign for the Democratic
presidential nomination, he told audiences of the time he stopped
in a barbershop in New Hampshire, announced who he was and what he
was running for, and was told by a patron, ``Yep, we were just
laughing about that yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   He enjoyed telling stories to his friends, and when in the final
stage of his illness he fell mostly silent, it was an agonizing
loss for his friends. ``You'd tell him a joke and his eyes would
twinkle as he prepared to tell you two back _ but he couldn't get
them out,'' said Rep. Pat Williams, a Democrat of Montana. Still,
his friends remembered that even after he got Parkinson's disease
and realized how serious it was, he joked about it. Indeed, he
suggested there was a similarity between his disease and Paula
Parkinson, a lobbyist who was involved in one of Washington's
periodic sex scandals. ``They both cause you to lose sleep,'' he
said, ``and they both give you the shakes.''
</P>
<P>
   But as the disease progressed Udall was confined to the veterans
hospital in Washington. Michael Lewis, a columnist for The New York
Times Magazine, found that Sen. John McCain, the conservative
Republican from Arizona, was one of Udall's few visitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mo reached out to me in 50 different ways,'' McCain told
Lewis. When McCain was elected to the House in 1982, he said, Udall
took the young congressman in hand although they did not think
alike on many issues. Four years later, when McCain won the Senate
seat surrendered by a retiring Barry Goldwater, he felt his deepest
sense of gratitude not to his fellow conservative but to Udall.
</P>
<P>
   ``There no way Mo could have been more wonderful,'' McCain told
Lewis, ``And there was no reason for him to be that way.'' Whenever
he takes the Senate floor on behalf of American Indians or argues
that the Republican Party should support environmentalism, McCain
said, he remembers his debt to Mo Udall.

COMMENTARY: CLEARING PREACHERS AND PEDDLERS FROM TIMES SQUARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN TIERNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You had to feel sympathy for Judge John Koeltl on
Friday evening. He was presiding over a hearing in U.S. District
Court in Manhattan on whether the Giuliani administration should be
allowed to kick the Hebrew Israelite preachers out of Times Square.
It was like trying to decide which side to root for in the
Iran-Iraq war.
</P>
<P>
   The preachers, commonly known as the Black Israelites, argued
that the city had acted unfairly when it ejected them last month.
Considering Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's less than fervent devotion to
the principles of free speech, that argument sounded quite
plausible.
</P>
<P>
   The city maintained that for years the Israelites and their
sound system had made life miserable for pedestrians on the crowded
sidewalk and for people working in nearby offices. Considering the
preachers' penchant for screaming about the need to enslave and
kill white people, that argument sounded pretty plausible, too.
</P>
<P>
   The judge told the lawyers to try negotiating an agreement that
would allow the Black Israelites to return, with limits on noise
and the space they could occupy. That was the most obvious
compromise. Since the city has no right to choose which messages
are fit to be heard, it's unfair to single out the Black Israelites
for banishment as long as others are allowed to preach in Times
Square.
</P>
<P>
   But there's another compromise that's just as equitable: Banish
all the sidewalk preachers from Times Square _ and, while we're at
it, the sidewalk sketch artists, musicians, jugglers, drummers,
mimes and assorted hustlers.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, this ban would horrify those who think street preachers
and performers add charm to Times Square. There are said to be
tourists who enjoy even the mimes. But surely their pleasure is
vastly outweighed by the collective pain of the other passers-by
who just want to get to the subway or the office. Not even tourists
enjoy being serenaded by an hour of drumming as they wait in line
at the TKTS discount ticket booth.
</P>
<P>
   This ban would especially horrify Norman Siegel, the executive
director of the New York Civil Liberties Union, which is defending
the Black Israelites. (Although the black preachers often describe
the white man as the devil, they explained on Friday evening that
this did not preclude them from using one as a lawyer.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I would certainly oppose any plan to restrict free speech in
Times Square,'' Siegel said. ``One of the most sacred rights in
America is to be able to stand on a street corner and preach. As
long as you're not obstructing pedestrians or creating a nuisance,
like making too much noise at night, you should be free to get on a
soapbox anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   But now that Times Square is so crowded that pedestrians are
routinely forced to walk in the street, the city might be able to
legally justify a ban on anything that obstructs those sidewalks.
Preachers and hustlers would still be free to work on less crowded
sidewalks nearby, and the city might also set aside special areas
for soapbox orators, like Speakers' Corner in Hyde Park, London.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's recent decision to restrict groups from giving news
conferences on the steps of City Hall was troubling because that
site is such a logical place for political debate. But who goes to
Times Square to be enlightened about politics or religion? Why give
the sidewalks of New York's entertainment district to the least
entertaining people in town?
</P>
<P>
   The Black Israelites and other sidewalk performers have
privatized choice public space. They have taken over some of New
York's most valuable real estate, paying at most a small fee for a
permit, to further their own enterprises by collecting money and
selling books, T-shirts and tapes.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the city didn't want to banish these sidewalk
entrepreneurs from Times Square, it could at least start charging
them market rates for the space. Besides bringing in revenue,
charging market rents could help screen out incompetents _ a truly
awful guitarist, for instance, could not collect enough money
during his Times Square gig to pay the rent for it.
</P>
<P>
   Applying a market-rent policy uniformly in Times Square would
also clear out other moochers, like the armed forces recruiting
station that pays no rent for its prime spot. The new rents might
drive out the newsstands, too, which would mean pedestrians in
Times Square would be deprived of immediate access to the wisdom
herein. But somehow they _ and the First Amendment _ would probably
survive.

MORRIS UDALL, FORMER LIBERAL CONSCIENCE OF THE HOUSE, DIES
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Morris Udall of Arizona, a liberal conscience of the House of
Representatives for 30 years and a tireless advocate for
environmental protection and political reform, died late Saturday
in Washington. He was 76.
</P>
<P>
   Udall died of complications from Parkinson's disease, according
to the Morris K. Udall Foundation in Tucson, Ariz. First diagnosed
in 1980, the disease led to Udall's resignation from Congress in
1991. He spent the final stage of his life in a veterans hospital
in Washington, seldom conscious.
</P>
<P>
   Udall was one of those rare figures who flourished even though
his politics frequently did not square with the views of many of
his constituents, known for their conservatism and support of Sen.
Barry Goldwater. But from the time Udall was first elected in 1961
in Arizona's 2nd Congressional District until his retirement, they
voted for him in overwhelming numbers and did not seem to care
about his high ratings from liberal groups and unions.
</P>
<P>
   Arizonans identified with Udall's unabashed love of unspoiled
nature, and they applauded his efforts to create safeguards for the
environment, including curbs on strip mining and legislation to
protect Alaskan wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Udall's supporters came to believe that the 6-foot-5, one-time
Denver Nuggets basketball player might be a viable presidential
candidate. Udall believed it, too, hoping his reputation for
honesty would help him become the nation's first elected
post-Watergate president. But in 1976 he finished second in six
Democratic primaries, losing the nomination to Gov. Jimmy Carter of
Georgia. Udall's liberal positions, including support for a
national health insurance program, were too extreme for his party
and he lacked the name recognition and money to finance his
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Udall considered running again in 1980, because he did not
believe that Carter could defeat Ronald Reagan. But mindful of
questions about his health, he supported Sen. Edward Kennedy,
D-Mass. Udall had disclosed that he had Parkinson's disease, a
progressive disorder often characterized by tremors, stiffness of
muscles and a deterioration of certain functions of the brain.
Despite his condition, Udall remained active in the House for
another decade.
</P>
<P>
   In his years in Congress, he fought for the environment, urged
curbs on tobacco products, favored cutting the national debt and
pushed for campaign reform and disclosure.
</P>
<P>
   From the start, he disclosed his finances and put his income tax
returns in open files. He gave up his law practice and did not keep
outside sources of income. And, he played a key role in drafting
and passing the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Morris King Udall was born June 15, 1922, in St. John's, Ariz.,
the son of Levi and Louise Lee Udall. A great-grandfather had led
the first Mormons into Arizona from Utah. His father started out
digging ditches, achieved success as a farmer, took law-school
correspondence courses and served for 16 years on the Arizona
Supreme Court. Udall's mother wrote ``Mine and Me,'' a story of a
Hopi woman.
</P>
<P>
   Morris Udall had two brothers and two sisters. One brother,
Stewart, was elected to Congress and served until he was appointed
secretary of the interior in President John Kennedy's Cabinet.
Morris Udall won the election to fill the seat.
</P>
<P>
   At age 5, Mo Udall's right eye was accidentally injured by a
playmate. But Levi Udall was still struggling and did not have
enough money to obtain decent medical care for his son. Soon, the
eye became infected and it was lost. Udall said the experience help
mold him, and he fought for the right of all Americans to have
quality care regardless of ability to pay.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from high school in 1940, Udall entered the
University of Arizona, but then maneuvered his way into the Army,
serving in the South Pacific and achieving the rank of captain in
the Army Air Corps in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, he returned to the University of Arizona, where he was
student body president and co-captain and all-conference forward in
basketball. He also played briefly with the Denver Nuggets, but his
athletic career was set aside in 1949, with the beginning of his
legal and political career.
</P>
<P>
   He was elected chief deputy attorney for Pima County in 1950 and
later was elected county attorney before going to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by Norma Gilbert, his third wife, and by four
brothers and sisters, six children and seven grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Before illness took its toll, Udall enjoyed creating his own
constituent newsletters, which were published in 1972 as ``The
Education of a Congressman.'' His witticisms were the subject of
another book, ``Too Funny to be President,'' published after his
presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
   As a member of the House Post Office Committee, he would joke:
``Let's turn inflation over to the Post Office. That'll slow it
down.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was seeking the presidential nomination, he told
audiences of the time he stopped in a New Hampshire barbershop,
announced who he was and what he was running for, and was told by a
patron, ``Yep, we were just laughing about that yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of his life, Michael Lewis , a New York Times
Magazine columnist, found that Sen. John McCain, the conservative
Republican from Arizona, was one of Udall's few visitors at the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mo reached out to me in 50 different ways,'' McCain told
Lewis. When McCain was first elected, he said, Udall took the young
congressman in hand despite their ideological differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way Mo could have been more wonderful,'' McCain
said. ``And there was no reason for him to be that way.'' Whenever
he takes the Senate floor on behalf of American Indians or argues
that the Republican Party should support environmentalism, McCain
said, he remembers his debt to Mo Udall.

AT BRILL'S, MORE LIGHT, LESS `HOMEWORK'  
PRECEDING PRIME TIME WITH INFOMERCIALS  
THE A.P ON LINE RAISES QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, Steven Brill, the chairman and editor in chief of the
media-watchdog monthly Brill's Content, lost his editor, Michael
Kramer, and may have lost some of what even Brill says is the
sometimes overly heavy feel of his magazine, as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're basically lightening up a bit on the tone of
everything,'' Brill said last week after he and Kramer decided to
part company _ although the two changes are not related. Brill's
Content has been awfully serious _ dour, even _ in its pursuit of
journalistic hi-jinks.
</P>
<P>
   Even Brill acknowledges that during its first six months it has,
at times, read like ``homework.'' The question he has always had to
answer is: Can his magazine find an audience with nonjournalists?
</P>
<P>
   ``The original rap against this magazine was that this is
interesting for us, but is anyone else going to care? '' Brill
said, the ``us'' being professional journalists.
</P>
<P>
   Is the solution to run some big, splashy, puffy profiles?
</P>
<P>
   No, Brill said. But he said the February issue would be a bit
more reader friendly. ``You will see a difference in the next issue
in the design and pace of the magazine. There are a lot of things
that are shorter.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Brill added, ``there are still a significant number of
pieces about serious stuff. But there's a much better mix so that
the magazine doesn't have the feel of homework that it has had.''
</P>
<P>
   Brill said the cover would be less busy, and he had added a
one-page photo essay.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is not unusual for infomercials, those half-hour plugs for
everything from exercise machines to car wax, to appear on
network-owned television stations, like WCBS-TV in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But it is certainly unusual, if not precedent setting, when they
turn up on a weeknight at 7:30 p.m., directly before prime time
starts.
</P>
<P>
   That is one reason a decision by the executive in charge of the
stations CBS owns, to fill three half-hour blocks this month with
infomercials, raised so many eyebrows in the television industry,
including some inside CBS itself.
</P>
<P>
   The executive, Jonathan Klein, sold time to three companies for
infomercials, displacing such highly rated syndicated shows as
``Entertainment Tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason, several CBS executives said, was a simple desire to
generate extra revenue for the CBS stations before the end of the
calendar year.
</P>
<P>
   The infomercial issue is clearly a sensitive one inside CBS.
Network executives, including Klein, declined to comment on the
decision. Privately, many CBS executives expressed unhappiness with
what they said was the likelihood that the decision would leave the
impression that CBS is desperate for revenue.
</P>
<P>
   This impression would run counter to some promising developments
for CBS, with several prime-time shows demonstrating strong
improvement, including one, ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' moving
toward outright hit status.
</P>
<P>
   Klein, who has long experience with local advertising sales at
network affiliated stations, where it is common to pre-empt network
programs for locally owned programs in an effort to bring in more
advertising revenue, ordered the infomercials played at 7:30 p.m.
on 13 CBS stations.
</P>
<P>
   A click away from many major Internet destinations _ from the
``Today's News'' section of America Online to the front page of the
search engine Yahoo _ _ is a wealth of headlines and articles from
The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   This may seem routine to news consumers, but is a matter of
puzzlement to some newsroom executives, who wonder why an
organization created as a membership cooperative that now includes
1,500 newspapers, is providing material for sites competing _
successfully _ with the newspapers' own online editions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The A.P. is being used on line by search engines in terms that
seem competitively irrational,'' was the way Steve Coll, The
Washington Post's managing editor, put it at the Jupiter
Communications Digital News Forum in Atlanta last week. Web sites
like America Online's AOL.com and Yahoo have no news of their own
to offer, but a Jupiter survey indicates they are among the most
popular destinations for those seeking a quick news fix on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's AOL contributing?'' Ron Martin, the editor of The
Atlanta Journal-Constitution asked, picking up Coll's theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or Yahoo?'' Coll added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is: a lot of money,'' said Wick Temple, the A.P.'s
vice president and director of newspaper membership, when asked
about the issue. On-line fees run in the ``millions of dollars'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   The group's 24-member board, Temple said, voted 12 years ago to
create an online news wire _ offering only the work of the A.P.'s
own journalists _ and sell it to Compuserve, one of the first
online services. If The Associated Press now refused to do business
with America Online or Yahoo, he said, it would simply open the
door for competitors like the Reuters news service.

CHARLES ROSE, PROSECUTED ORGANIZED CRIME FIGURES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Charles E. Rose, who prosecuted bank robbers,
narcotics traffickers, terrorists and organized-crime figures in 15
years with the U.S. attorney's office for the Eastern District of
New York, died on Saturday at his home in Manhattan. He was 51.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a brain tumor, said his sister, Marilyn Duer.
</P>
<P>
   From 1994 to his death, Rose was a partner in the Manhattan law
firm of De Feis, O'Connell &AMP; Rose, specializing in defense
litigation in white-collar crime and some organized-crime cases.
</P>
<P>
   He was with the federal prosecutor's office from 1979 to 1994
and held the titles of assistant U.S. attorney, deputy chief and
chief of the office's narcotics section, senior litigation counsel
and executive assistant U.S. attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charlie Rose was the finest prosecutor I ever worked with. He
was smart, dedicated and a cop's prosecutor,'' New York Police
Commissioner Howard Safir said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In Rose's early years in the U.S. attorney's office he
prosecuted bank robbers and worked with the FBI-New York Police
Department joint task force on bank robbery. Later, he shifted to
supervising the prosecution of cases developed by the police
department and the FBI in a task force on terrorism. In that role
he was concerned mainly with a group seeking independence for
Puerto Rico, whose bombing targets included the headquarters of the
police department and the FBI headquarters at Federal Plaza, and
also with an anarchist group, the United Freedom Front. In 1986,
Freedom Front members were tried and convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Rose went on to work on cases involving heroin trafficking in
organized crime. Later, he was prominent in the prosecution of
reputed Mafia figures including Vincent Gigante, who was arrested
in 1990 on federal charges that he conspired with 14 other reputed
gangsters to rig bids and extort payoffs from contractors on
multimillion-dollar bids with the New York City Housing Authority.
</P>
<P>
   A superseding indictment in 1993 accused Gigante of sanctioning
the murders of six mobsters and plotting to kill three others,
including John J. Gotti, the Gambino boss who was his former
archrival.
</P>
<P>
   By early 1997, after Rose had stopped being a prosecutor, all
defendants in the conspiracy case had been convicted or acquitted _
except for Gigante, whose case had been delayed by hearings about
whether he was mentally deranged. Eventually he was tried and
convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Rose was born and raised in the Bronx, received a bachelor's
degree in 1968 from Cornell, a master's degree in 1976 in
criminology from the State University of New York at Albany and a
law degree in 1979 from Brooklyn Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his sister, of St. Peter's, Pa., he is survived by his
mother, Marie L. Rose of Hohokus, N.J.; his wife, the former Carol
Mennie, from whom he was long separated; and his fiancee, Elaine
Banar of Manhattan.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ All season, the black beret for sale in the hat
department at the trendy Fred Segal shop in Santa Monica, Calif.,
had been more a conversation piece than a must-have purchase, and a
number of shoppers stopped to make some crack or other about what
they all recognized as ``the Monica Lewinsky beret.''
</P>
<P>
   Then last week, with the Judiciary Committee debating the
consequences of the president's cover-up of his dalliance with Ms.
Lewinsky, who should walk in but the world's most famous former
intern, wearing low-key leggings and huge, movie-star sunglasses?
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Lewinsky purchased the beret, put it on and wore it out
of the store, the sales staff nearly had to be resuscitated _ all
the more so because her credit card took five minutes to clear and
they had to refrain from laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was trying to look totally incognito wearing these big
glasses,'' said a Los Angeles shop owner, ``and then she puts on
the hat.''

<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ For weeks, on the practice field, on the
team bus and in the hallway between team meetings, Giants wide
receiver Amani Toomer would sneak up behind quarterback Kent
Graham.
</P>
<P>
   ``Throw me the ball,'' Toomer would say. ``I'll make you
famous.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday afternoon, 57 seconds remained in the game between the
Giants and a Denver team chasing history when Graham looked across
the huddle at Toomer and called this play: ``A2, double seam.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Toomer's time, his wish no longer a whisper in a hallway.
Seconds later, with the Giants trailing by 16-13, a Graham pass was
spiraling toward Toomer in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball was in the air and looked really big,'' he later
said. ``It looked like the Hindenburg. I knew I was going to catch
it.''
</P>
<P>
   An acrobatic catch left Toomer lying in the back of the end zone
with a 37-yard touchdown pass, and 48 fitful seconds later, the
Broncos' undefeated season was no longer. A 20-16 Giants victory
three weeks from the end of the regular season had preserved the
singular achievement of the 1972 Miami Dolphins, the National
Football League's only team to go unbeaten in both the regular
season and post-season.
</P>
<P>
   A dreary Giants season suddenly had a flashy moment of
significance, a game that is among the biggest upsets in the
history of the league's regular season. On the anniversary of last
year's division title-clinching victory over the Washington
Redskins, Giants Stadium was again the scene of wild celebration on
the field and in the stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team will be remembered for this game,'' Coach Jim Fassel
said of his Giants, who have a 6-8 record, and remarkably, are one
game behind Tampa Bay and Arizona in the chase for a wild-card
playoff berth. ``Not for all the other things that have gone on
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Graham: ``This is what dreams are made of.''
</P>
<P>
   And Toomer, who has been used sparingly for most of three Giants
seasons, felt all his jabbering at Graham had paid off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hound Kent every day,'' he said with a wide smile. ``And I
was right.''
</P>
<P>
   If Graham is not famous, as Toomer predicted, at least he has a
charming story to entertain his grandchildren. It will be a tale
about the day Graham, a career back-up leading a losing team,
outplayed John Elway, a future Hall of Famer who was guiding a team
that had not lost in 13 games this season.
</P>
<P>
   Graham completed 21 of 33 passes for 265 yards and two
touchdowns and did not throw an interception. Elway completed 19 of
36 passes for 180 yards, with no touchdown passes and one
interception. In five games at Giants Stadium, Elway has a 1-4
record, with three touchdown passes and five interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazing, unbelievable, fantastic,'' said Graham, whose
starting job was in jeopardy entering Sunday's game. ``It was all
of those things.''
</P>
<P>
   For the defending Super Bowl champion Broncos, it was a sobering
game of surprises.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad and it hurts because I think we thought right to the
end that we'd pull it out,'' said Denver running back Terrell
Davis. ``You go so long without losing, you start to think you'll
pull them all out. No one on our team believed we'd lose until time
ran out, and then it became very real.''
</P>
<P>
   The game ended with the Broncos at the Giants' 30-yard line, and
with Elway heaving a final desperation pass at the end zone that
was batted down by the Giants' Percy Ellsworth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like going for a basketball rebound,'' said Ellsworth,
a former high school basketball All-American. ``You've got to take
it away from the other team.''
</P>
<P>
   As Ellsworth spoke, he stood next to a bulletin board that
contained the message ``Shock the World.''
</P>
<P>
   The Giants had delivered this shock to the football community
with a swarming defense that for one of the few times this season
resembled the unit that led the 1997 Giants to a division title.
The Giants sacked Elway three times and did not allow Denver a
touchdown until the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   An ingenious maneuver _ using the rookie safety Shaun Williams
as the replacement for the injured nickel linebacker Scott Galyon _
proved fruitful.
</P>
<P>
   Williams made a pivotal interception of Elway and was a key
reason the Giants were able to limit Denver's All-Pro tight end
Shannon Sharpe to 4 catches and just 25 passing yards.
</P>
<P>
   On offense, the Giants looked unusually fluid and confident.
running their plays crisply and blocking with authority. Graham was
sacked just once, and that was because his receivers were covered.
</P>
<P>
   Giants running back Gary Brown ran for 112 yards on only 18
carries, averaging 6.2 yards a attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of good defense and an effective offense kept
the Giants in the game early, even though the Broncos were moving
the football and led by 6-3 late in the second quarter. But with 51
seconds left in the half, Graham connected with running back Tiki
Barber, who caught Graham's pass in the left flat and ran untouched
into the end zone for a 21-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Barber's score was the last play in a 15-play, 80-yard drive
that was one of the Giants' best possessions of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' lead was cut to 10-9 with a third-quarter Denver
field goal, but Williams' interception in the fourth quarter set in
motion another Giant drive, fueled by a 45-yard run by Brown, to
the Broncos' 1-yard line. From there, Brown was stopped in his
third-down attempt to score running up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel made the safe decision on fourth down, sending in Brad
Daluiso to kick a 19-yard field goal for a 13-9 lead. It was an
unpopular choice inside Giants Stadium at the time, and a
potentially controversial one when the Broncos regained the lead on
a 27-yard touchdown run by Davis on Denver's next possession.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way our defense was playing,'' Fassel said. ``I thought
the field goal made sense.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel spent less time defending his decision to kick the field
goal because of the game-winning Graham-to-Toomer touchdown pass.
But before that strike, there were more tense moments for the
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Brown had not fumbled the football since the end of the 1993
season _ or 807 consecutive touches of the ball _ but he fumbled
his final carry of Sunday's game with 3:36 left.
</P>
<P>
   But the Giants' defense forced another Denver punt, one which
rolled past Toomer and had Graham beginning the Giants' final drive
at his 14-yard line with 1:49 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   In the huddle, wide receiver Chris Calloway _ who may be the
quietest Giant off the field _ shouted to his teammates: ``We're
going to win this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Calloway then caught a 15-yard pass from Graham. On the next
play, Graham scrambled up the middle for 23 yards.
</P>
<P>
   On a third-and-10, Graham completed an 11-yard pass to the
rookie Joe Jurevicius, who went out of bounds at the Denver 37.
</P>
<P>
   On the next play, even though the Giants were almost in range to
attempt a game-tying field goal, Graham went deep to Toomer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said: `We've got to go after them right here,' '' Graham
said.
</P>
<P>
   Toomer ran to his position at the far right edge of the Giants'
formation. The Giants had four receivers split wide and the Broncos
defenders were mostly bunched to the left, away from Toomer.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as I saw they had man-to-man coverage on my side,''
Toomer said. ``I knew they were in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   He knew, as he had predicted, that he, and Graham, might be
famous. &QL;

<P>
   NEVE SHALOM, Israel _ It took an Arab-Israeli village to provide
Hillary Clinton with the ideal backdrop for her first appearance
here, pleading the case to the Israeli public for the
land-for-security plan that is now seen here as much more her
husband's priority than the Israeli prime minister's.
</P>
<P>
   This tiny planned community of 30 families an hour outside
Jerusalem is one of the country's few experiments in cross-cultural
living. It has a bilingual school that has won international honors
and a carefully maintained ethnic balance of Arabs and Jews, all of
them Israeli citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The self-described ``oasis of peace'' was chosen as a symbol of
the possibility of reconciliation between Israel and the
Palestinians, the goal of the agreement brokered by President
Clinton six weeks ago in Wye Mills, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The town was flattered by the recognition. A big hand-drawn ``It
Takes A Village'' poster, referring to Mrs. Clinton's book, was
draped behind the podium where she made her nationally televised
remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very grateful for the hard work that the prime minister
and Chairman Arafat and my husband did at Wye, that helped move us
closer to fulfilling a dream of peace between Israelis and
Palestinians, despite the setbacks that come when peace is being
pursued,'' Mrs. Clinton said, with Sara Netanyahu, the prime
minister's wife, sitting beside her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strong belief that peace will prevail must once again be
enforced,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving by White House limousine about 4 a.m. Washington time
for her first stop, Mrs. Clinton impressed local people with her
stamina and poise. Later in the day, she accompanied Clinton to a
memorial gathering at the Mount of Olives grave site of the slain
Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and to a Hanukkah candle-lighting
ceremony at the Israeli presidential residence. She also attended
Clinton's speeches to Israeli youth leaders and a state banquet.
</P>
<P>
   But her independent itinerary before that was distinctly her
own: it was at once an advertisement for her vision of
multicultural education and community-based child-raising, and a
carefully targeted appeal to ordinary Israelis on behalf of the
U.S. peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   Her visit to Neve Shalom was followed by a visit to the oncology
ward of a Jerusalem children's hospital funded by an American
Jewish women's group, where Orthodox Jewish patients and
Palestinians from East Jerusalem receive cancer therapy. Mrs.
Clinton moved on to the headquarters of a home preschool program
that was started in Israel to meet the needs of poor Arab and
recent Jewish immigrant families, a program she helped adopt for
use in rural Arkansas 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   With fresh-scrubbed schoolchildren waving paper banners and
earnest young teachers discussing their techniques, the scene at
Neve Shalom seemed benignly archetypal for a Hillary Clinton visit.
Three kindergarten children _ Muhammed Najar, 4, an Israeli Arab
Muslim; Kerem Ben-Yeshai, 5, an Israeli Jew, and Mouna Boulos, 4,
an Israeli Arab Christian _ stood in their classroom before a
phalanx of cameras and solemnly lit a Ramadan lamp, a menorah, and,
with an electric switch, a little tabletop Christmas tree.
</P>
<P>
   The banners held aloft at Mrs. Clinton's arrival were adorned
with hastily crayoned flowers and doves, rather than national
symbols. The original plan was to greet Mrs. Clinton with real
flags, locals here said, but after fuller contemplation of the
spectacle, the event's handlers had second thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were going to have three flags, then they decided they
didn't want Palestinian flags, so they decided on no flags,'' Laila
Hasuna, an Arabic teacher at the Neve Shalom school, said with a
wry smile.
</P>
<P>
   It was widely presumed here that the ban on Palestinian
flag-waving was imposed mainly to protect Mrs. Clinton, who, on the
strength of one offhand comment this year, earned a reputation
among Israelis as a back-room advocate of independence for the West
Bank and the Gaza Strip, which she is scheduled to visit Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in May via satellite to a gathering of European
teen-agers, Mrs. Clinton said that she thought it was ``in the
long-term interests of the Middle East for Palestine to be a state
and for it to be a state that is responsible for its citizens'
well-being, a state that has responsibility for providing education
and health care and economic opportunity to its citizens, a state
that has to accept the responsibility of governing.''
</P>
<P>
   This seeming endorsement of statehood and her use of the
officially taboo term ``Palestine'' was condemned by American
Jewish organizations and quickly disavowed by the White House.
During her tour Sunday, Israeli journalists shouted questions on
Palestinian independence that were ignored.

 By JODY GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ About the only thing that will make this Cowboys
game look better is the fact the previous week's game film is still
sitting on a shelf at Valley Ranch.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But for the second consecutive Sunday, the Cowboys were the far
inferior team, this time losing a 20-17 decision to the Kansas City
Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   It was actually Dallas' third consecutive loss, the other two
coming at the hands of Minnesota and New Orleans. And it was again
a wasted opportunity, with Dallas still needing one victory (or one
Arizona loss) to win the NFC East.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, we're trying,'' running back Emmitt Smith said in
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   Like the team that finally wins games after being eliminated
from the playoffs, the Cowboys eventually managed to score
touchdowns on their final two drives to make the score respectable.
But while the numbers weren't as horrendous as the previous week in
New Orleans, the level of play wasn't much better until that final
quarter. Eliminate those two possessions, and the Cowboys spent the
other 45 minutes compiling 106 yards of total offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish we could have had that (intensity) the whole game,''
linebacker Randall Godfrey said. ``It's tough to say why we were
flat in the first half.''
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly not tough to say where. The ground game again
fell upon hard times.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, it was New Orleans' blitz that stymied the run.
Sunday, it was Kansas City's eight-man front. It wasn't as ugly as
last week's eight-yard debacle, but it wasn't a whole lot better.
Smith carried 14 times for 42 yards, his only breakout being one
11-yard dash. Receivers Billy Davis and Michael Irvin each had one
carry to take Dallas' rushing total to 51 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason you see guys in here so disappointed is that we
think we're working hard enough,'' Smith said. ``We know what's
going on. We just can't win a game.''
</P>
<P>
   The air attack was passable but anything but deadly, especially
after the Cowboys lost Irvin to lower-back spasms at the end of the
first half. With Ernie Mills already shelved for the season and
tight end David LaFleur out possibly until the end of the regular
season, quarterback Troy Aikman was searching for targets. Patrick
Jeffers was the big winner with five receptions for 74 yards,
including a 28-yard touchdown. Smith actually fared better in this
stat than on the ground, catching four balls for 41 yards and a TD.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way they were playing us, we probably needed to take it to
them a little more,'' Jeffers said. ``We were able to make
adjustments and move the ball a little better in the second half,
but it wasn't enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys punted on their first four possessions despite
having three drives begin on their 41-, 34- and 43-yard lines. They
finally got on the board with a field goal but only after seven
plays netted 17 yards. A 35-yard punt return by Tyrone Hughes
allowed Dallas to start on the Kansas City 32. The Chiefs stopped
them at the 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they first started running the ball early in the game,
they weren't going anywhere,'' Chiefs linebacker Donnie Edwards
said. ``Then, we knew they might be in trouble. We got after them
early and stopped the run, and that's what we wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys would have liked to do the same. Though quarterback
Rich Gannon had powered the Chiefs to three consecutive games of 31
points or more with a potent air attack, it was Bam Morris who
caused the most problems Sunday. The former Texas Tech standout
rushed for 137 yards on 27 carries, many of those yards coming
after he shook off a Dallas defender or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's 260 pounds. We tried,'' Godfrey said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys repeatedly missed tackles, often laying the initial
hit only a yard or two out only to see Morris escape from their
grasp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bam is huge,'' Dallas safety George Teague said. ``I don't
know how he looks to you guys, but he's very big, and he absorbs
hits very well. He takes a lick and keeps on moving his legs. We
didn't mess him up enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Cowboys' lousy halftime stats _ five first downs and
93 total yards _ the score was tied at 3. But Dallas let things
spin out of control with a series of mistakes in the third quarter.
A fumbled punt return by Hughes gave Kansas City the ball at
midfield. The Chiefs then marched 50 yards, with Morris reaching
the end zone from a yard out.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays later, Chiefs cornerback James Hasty jumped in front
of Jeffers to snag an interception, returning the ball 28 yards to
the Dallas 35. Gannon scored on a nine-yard run to make it 17-3.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys were again without cornerback Deion Sanders, who had
missed the previous two games with a sprained big toe but was
expected back. With Irvin out in the second half, the Cowboys were
without two of their biggest emotional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we are better with those players that are hurt,''
Aikman said. ``But you can't dwell on that. You still have to
execute.''
</P>
<P>
   Just three weeks ago, the Cowboys had won four consecutive games
and six of their last seven. They had gotten through a stretch
without Aikman and were looking at an easy finish, with their last
four opponents after the Vikings all under .500.
</P>
<P>
   But that 8-3 mark has quickly become 8-6. They are a mere 2-6
outside of their pitiful division, the only victories coming over
Carolina and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   And now the Cowboys are hearing echoes of last year's 6-10
campaign, which included a winless December as part of a
season-ending five-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you this: It's not going to be the same kind of
December,'' Godfrey said. ``It's right here. We've just got to grab
it.''

METS' HENDERSON PLANS TO STEAL YANKEES' THUNDER
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE _ It took a little longer than expected, but Rickey
Henderson and the Mets finally agreed Sunday on a one-year contract
with a base salary of $1.8 million and an option for a second year.
Henderson, who will turn 40 on Christmas, quickly showed he was
just as brash as he was in his first stint in New York, when he
starred for the Yankees from 1985 to 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say the Mets are going to be the best team in New York
right now,'' Henderson said from Oakland Sunday afternoon. ``The
Yankees have been cheering the crowd for a long time. It's about
time for the Mets to take over.''
</P>
<P>
   If Henderson, who is expected to play left field and bat leadoff
for the Mets, reaches 500 plate appearances (he had 670 for the
Oakland Athletics last season), the second year is guaranteed at $2
million.
</P>
<P>
   And with various incentives for games played and plate
appearances, Henderson could earn another $500,000 each year.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he might be making in the currently fevered
free-agent market if he were in his prime, Henderson _ probably
grossly underestimating _ said $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   But what mattered most, he said, was winning. That and the
career records for runs scored and walks. Henderson has the major
league stolen base mark (1,297). With 2,014 runs, he is sixth and
trails the leader, Ty Cobb, by 232. With 1,890 walks, Henderson is
third behind Babe Ruth (2,056). He is within two years of both
records.
</P>
<P>
   Even though he batted a career-low .236 last season, Henderson,
who will be entering his 21st major league season, scored 101 runs
and led the majors in both walks (118) and stolen bases (66) last
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can still hit if that's what it calls for me to do,'' said
the right-handed-hitting Henderson, who is a career .283 hitter.
``But in my game, being a leadoff hitter, hitting doesn't make a
difference if you can get on base 40 percent of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is something Henderson has done like clockwork. His
career on-base percentage is .404.
</P>
<P>
   Mets General Manager Steve Phillips called Henderson ``arguably
the best leadoff hitter in the history of the game.'' His signing
at the winter meetings here completed a revamped Mets lineup that
will include the newly acquired Robin Ventura and Bobby Bonilla.
</P>
<P>
   Mets Manager Bobby Valentine, speaking from Texas, said of
Henderson, ``He's as fine a player as I've ever had to manage
against.'' The Mets have not had a prototypical leadoff hitter
since before Valentine became their manager in August 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson said he had not lost anything since his glory days.
And he can obviously still run _ last year, he had four more steals
than the entire Mets team.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can still get on base and he can still score runs,'' said
Art Howe, his manager with the A's last season. ``And he's the best
I've ever seen at working a count and making a pitcher work every
ounce.''
</P>
<P>
   Henderson led the major leagues last season in pitches seen
during at time at bat (4.33) and total pitches seen (2,903).
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll affect the outcome of games,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson will become just the second Mets player to wear No. 24
since Willie Mays retired after the 1973 season. (The otherwise
forgettable Kelvin Torve assumed it briefly in 1991.) Henderson
would have preferred to end his career with Oakland, where it began
(as Mays did in New York), and his agents also talked to San
Francisco and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   But the way Henderson was talking, the Hall of Fame can wait.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I can play until I'm 50,'' Henderson said. ``I've
got a few years left.'' &QL;

<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   I had arranged to meet my daughter, Tali, on Third Avenue, and
as I approached I could hear police cars screeching to the curb,
sirens blasting and red lights flashing. I spotted my daughter
rushing toward me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look Mom,'' she said, laughing and pointing across the street.
``It's a chicken!''
</P>
<P>
   To my surprise, there was a very alive, very frightened chicken,
the scrawniest creature I had ever seen. The poor chicken was
pacing back and forth on the sidewalk, undoubtedly trying to decide
whether to brave Third Avenue traffic or stay and face the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the police were facing a dilemma of their own. Once
within reach of the chicken, the officers realized they were not
sufficiently equipped to catch it.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, one of the more daring took action. Armed with an old
cardboard box grabbed from a grocery stand, he lunged at the
chicken and managed to scoop the box over it. Now things were back
at stalemate, with the chicken only temporarily confined.
</P>
<P>
   Hunger and the passing of time finally got the better of us. We
decided to leave. At last glance, the police cars were speeding
away, and three anxious police officers were guarding the box. We
passed up the chicken dishes on the lunch menu.

until it was too late. The owner was, of course, looking in a

across the entire width of the sidewalk.

   Even before I hit the ground hard, bloodying my knees, palms and
head, she was screaming, ``Oh, my God, are you OK? Tell me you're
OK!'' At least she seemed contrite! I muttered, ``Yeah, I'm OK.''
She responded: ``Not you! Biscuit! You could have broken her

   As a member of the Museum of Modern Art, Susan Striker was
savoring the luxury of a members-only opening of the Jackson
Pollock exhibit without being jostled by the usual crowds. She
noted that the overheard conversations were on a level above ``My
3-year-old can paint better than that,'' and that it seemed
everyone was serious about art. Then one elderly woman turned to
another and said, ``The best thing about Jackson Pollock is that
when I look at his paintings I don't see the floater in my eye.''

   Recently, a Queens-bound N train stood at 57th Street with its
doors open. Three minutes grew to five and then 10. Finally, the
driver took to the intercom, explaining that the train was stuck
because the one ahead was experiencing ``passenger interference.''
</P>
<P>
   A short silence ensued as the well-behaved passengers digested
the information. Then one man delivered his opinion. ``Shoot him,''
he suggested. JoAnn C. Gutin noted that he got his laugh, but
another rider stepped in with something more appropriate. ``Nah,''
he said. ``Passenger interference is only a 15-yard penalty.''

   Sheila Simpson was pleased when Eric, her highly active
7-year-old pupil arrived for his piano lesson and greeted her with
enthusiasm. However, she wondered whether she'd be able to hold his
attention that day _ she was going to explain how to count dotted
rhythms, a formidable concept for any child. He sat perfectly
still, eyes glued to her face. ``Oh boy,'' she thought. ``He's
taking it in. We'll be making real progress now.''
</P>
<P>
   She then asked Eric if he had any questions. There was a
thoughtful pause, and he lifted his gaze above her eye level.
Forget dotted rhythms. He had obviously been concentrating on what
he considered a less than perfect coiffure. ``Would you like me to
find you a hairbrush?'' he asked.

NFL TEAM OWNER ACCEPTS LESSER GUARANTEES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Mass.)  (rl) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ The New England Patriots yielded to a
rebellion by Connecticut lawmakers Sunday and agreed to concessions
in the proposed contract for moving the team to Hartford, prompting
legislative leaders to predict that the deal would sail through the
General Assembly in a special session on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots officials had maintained as recently as Wednesday that
they had given all the ground they planned to when they negotiated
the original proposal with Gov. John Rowland last month.
</P>
<P>
   Legislative leaders met at the governor's mansion for more than
five hours Sunday, hashing out the fine points of the new
agreement, which the Patriots' owner, Robert Kraft, endorsed over
crowd noise as he talked to Rowland from a skybox in St. Louis,
where his team was playing the Rams.
</P>
<P>
   The new terms reduce the state's potential payments, if luxury
seats and suites go unsold, from $17.5 million a year to $13
million a year. Connecticut officials said that considering
inflation, the state's potential liability for the guarantees over
the 30 years of the lease had been $1.4 billion _ a figure that had
never been disclosed but that now has been cut by $356 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've made huge, huge movement on this,'' Rowland said Sunday
afternoon on the front porch of the Executive Mansion. ``Is it a
good deal for him? It probably is _ I don't think he'd be doing it,
otherwise. But I think it's a darned good deal for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Rowland said that besides reducing the state guarantees, Kraft
would slash the price of the stadium's 6,000 club seats by $1,000 a
year, to $4,000 per seat per season, which state officials said
would increase the likelihood of a sellout. A consultant's report
prepared for the state concluded that the original prices for boxes
and club seats would have been, on average, among the highest in
the National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots also agreed to pay any overruns if the cost of
building the stadium exceeds $375 million, and agreed to pay a
tougher penalty if they leave Connecticut before the 30-year lease
is up.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland and Kraft reached a consensus on the changes during a
meeting at the Capitol Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate leader, Kevin Sullivan, said the changes were the
result of pressure from rank-and-file legislators, who in turn had
received many complaints from constituents. ``For the first time
today, I think I feel confident that it will pass in the Senate,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Thomas Ritter said the changes were possible
because Connecticut residents had expressed such enthusiasm for the
Patriots, in part by requesting thousands of season-ticket
applications. ``The residents of Connecticut made this a better
deal because the Kraft family understands how they'll be embraced,
and they don't feel the need to have those same kind of guarantees
as they had earlier,'' Ritter said.
</P>
<P>
   The reduction in the luxury guarantees cuts the state's
potential expense for the project over 30 years to about $1.5
billion, from $1.9 billion. That includes $1 billion for the
guarantees, $375 million to build the stadium, a $115 million fund
to pay for major repairs and $15 million for a training center.
Both Kraft and the governor said they hoped that sales would be
brisk enough that the state would never have to pay any guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   Several powerful lawmakers had been concerned about what would
happen if the team left before 30 years was up.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland said the Patriots now would have to pay off the
remaining cost of the bonds sold to pay for construction of the
stadium, and would have to pay the state the money it would have
received from the 10 percent ticket tax during the rest of the
lease. Rowland said the exit penalty would ``run up into the
hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars.''

2 WOMEN SUE RABBIS, ALLEGING BETRAYAL IN DIVORCE CASES
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By NADINE BROZAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For Chayie Sieger, the sense of powerlessness came
when she learned that 100 Orthodox rabbis she had never met had
granted her husband of 26 years a Jewish divorce without her
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   For Chani Lightman, the sense of shock came when she confided in
two rabbis about marital problems and then discovered they had
revealed those secrets to her husband and others in their
tight-knit religious community.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned by what they saw as betrayals and seeking to restore
reputations they say were virtually destroyed, the two women have
taken an unheard-of step: they are suing rabbis in civil courts of
law, their complaints based on the way they were treated by
religious courts.
</P>
<P>
   What makes these cases remarkable is that Mrs. Sieger, 45, from
Borough Park, Brooklyn, and Mrs. Lightman, 38, from Cedarhurst, on
Long Island, remain devoted to their religion, even as the
communities around them openly question their bold and, some say,
heretical challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am religious and feel very strongly about Judaism,'' Mrs.
Lightman said. ``But I don't feel this is a representation of what
Judaism or religion is. This is simply an abuse of power by some
men.''
</P>
<P>
   While Orthodox Jews who want a divorce in civil law still have
to observe the same procedures as any other Americans, obtaining a
Jewish get, or divorce, is necessary to remarry within Orthodoxy.
Women have long complained that Jewish courts, which act like
binding arbitration panels, have favored men, particularly on
matrimonial issues. In many instances, men have refused to grant
their wives a get, leaving the women unable to remarry. Men,
conversely, face no such consequences.
</P>
<P>
   But as both Mrs. Sieger and Mrs. Lightman learned, men sometimes
obtain a get without their wives' consent or knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   The two women seem unlikely candidates to challenge rabbis in
court. Both were born into strictly observant Orthodox families,
Mrs. Lightman in the modern Orthodox wing of Jewry, Mrs. Sieger in
the Bobover Hasidic sect, where, in many ways, women are subject to
the command of men.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lightman, a nurse and the mother of four daughters, won a
first-round victory on Nov. 18 when Justice David Goldstein of
State Supreme Court in Queens handed down a summary judgment
against a Long Island rabbi, David Weinberger of Temple Shaaray
Tefila in Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lightman had gone to Rabbi Weinberger for marital
counseling, and complains in her suit that he violated clerical
confidentiality by revealing secrets to her husband, Dr. Hylton
Lightman, and his lawyer, information that then showed up in papers
filed in a custody dispute.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, she said, unfounded rumors began to circulate,
including a rumor that she was failing to live by Jewish law and
``seeing a man in a social situation,'' stories that shook her
community. Now, she said, she is largely ostracized there and
attributes the loss of temporary custody of her daughters, ages 6
to 12, to the suspicions planted about her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am portrayed as an irreligious woman not eligible to be the
custodial parent to my children,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lightman would not say how much she was seeking in monetary
damages, only that it was ``in the millions.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Goldstein sharply condemned Rabbi Weinberger's
revelations, which included the fact that Mrs. Lightman had stopped
going to the mikvah, or ritual purification bath, so that her
husband would refrain from having sex with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my view, this was not only improper, it was outrageous and
offensive, especially considering the status and stature of these
defendants within the community,'' he wrote in his opinion.
</P>
<P>
   A second rabbi in whom Mrs. Lightman confided, Tzvi Flaum of
Congregation Kneseth Israel in Far Rockaway, Queens, may face the
same claim, depending on the results of a hearing on Jan. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Franklin H. Snitow, the lawyer for Rabbi Weinberger and Rabbi
Flaum as well as for Dr. Lightman in the couple's civil divorce
case, said he planned to appeal the judgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rabbi Weinberger was basically providing information to both
sides, and there was no expectation of confidentiality.'' Snitow
said. As for government jurisdiction over religious matters, he
said: ``The clergy is not licensed by the state, and the law does
not deal with their activities within the community; therefore, we
believe there is interference with their discharging their
religious obligations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sieger case involves different legal and religious issues.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sieger, who is a nursing home administrator, filed suit
last month in Supreme Court in Manhattan against the Union of
Orthodox Rabbis of the United States and Canada; the Bet Din Zedek
of America, a rabbinical court, and five individual rabbis for
libel and slander. She is seeking $13 million in damages.

 NEW YORK: in damages.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Her lawsuit revolves around an unusual instrument of Jewish
divorce, called a Heter Meah Rabonim, that the defendants got for
her husband, Chaim Sieger, on the grounds that she had repeatedly
refused to accept a routine get.
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Sieger insists she was the one who first requested a
divorce. She said she left Sieger in 1995 when their two children
were grown and married with their own families, hoping to quickly
dissolve the 26-year marriage. She said that she consented three
times to appear before a rabbinical court, but that she was never
called and was rebuffed when she inquired about the status of the
case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kept responding that I would go and nothing happened,'' she
said. ``Then I got a letter from Chaim's attorney, Abe Konstam,
stating, `As you are aware, a rabbinical divorce has already been
granted.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Without informing her, the rabbis had used the Heter Meah
Rabonim, which was introduced centuries ago to give men whose wives
are mentally incapacitated, unconscious or unwilling to accept a
get the right to take a second wife. It is not technically a Jewish
divorce but is a way of releasing a man in an untenable situation
from the bonds of marriage. It requires the signatures of 100
rabbis in three countries attesting to the woman's inability to
accept the get.
</P>
<P>
   Nathan Lewin, a Washington lawyer who specializes in Federal
litigation on religious liberty issues and who is representing
several of the defendants in the Sieger case, maintains that Mrs.
Sieger refused to appear before the Bet din.
</P>
<P>
   ``The courts have repeatedly refused to get involved in
second-guessing rabbinical courts,'' he said. ``If the rabbis
follow procedure, you can't say the result is defamation.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, he continued, ``There was no obligation to tell her
about the Heter.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Sullivan, a lawyer with the New York firm of
Herrick, Feinstein, who represents Mrs. Sieger, said his client was
treated unfairly.
</P>
<P>
   ``One hundred rabbis who never met her and knew nothing about
her signed a Heter accusing her of two specific crimes under Jewish
law,'' he said. ``One is that she failed to go to the mikvah or
ritual bath while living with her husband. If she engages in sex
while in a state of uncleanliness she places him in a state of
mortal sin, and a woman who does that cannot serve or prepare food
and is not to be trusted in the raising of children.''
</P>
<P>
   The second crime, he said, was the alleged disregard for the
summonses to appear before the Bet din.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Heter was really devastating,'' Mrs. Sieger said. ``I am
strangled by stigma. The choice was, do I remain branded for the
rest of my life or do I try to clear my name?''
</P>
<P>
   Denying that he had ever stood in the way of a divorce, Sieger
said he found the defamation suit to be a profound embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why didn't she take them to a higher Bet din and let them be
sanctioned by their peers?'' he asked. ``Every organization has a
policing mechanism.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rabbi Moshe David Tendler, professor of Talmudic law at the
Rabbi Isaac Elchanon Theological School, affiliated with Yeshiva
University, said: ``There is no such thing as a higher Bet din. In
addition, it is virtually impossible to convince one Bet din to sit
in judgment of another.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of the suits, the anguish and hostility in
both cases are palpable.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Lightman says she believes a severe beating she experienced
in September 1997 is somehow connected to the divorce. The Nassau
County police say the case is still under active investigation.
</P>
<P>
   She also said her husband had obtained a get without giving it
to her or telling her about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned about it,'' she said, ``when my sister-in-law called
to tell me that her divorced sister was introduced to Hylton as
being `the cream of the crop' as a potential date. I was shocked
because I had been asking him for a get for three years and he
always refused.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lightman, a pediatrician from South Africa, said he was
taken aback by the judge's ruling and described the resulting
publicity as ``a total desecration of Jewish Torah values.'' Asked
if he had, in fact, obtained a get, he said: ``That is so complex a
question that it goes beyond explanation. I cannot answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the sting of rejection they say they feel from friends,
neighbors and, in Mrs. Sieger's case, business contacts, neither
woman intends to abandon Orthodoxy.
</P>
<P>
   Both were raised in insular communities and both were married to
men they met through matchmakers.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Sieger, who grew up and still lives in the Hasidic world of
Borough Park, says that in fact, she supports the mechanisms that
have hurt her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The provision for the Heter is very important,'' she said. ``I
am happy it is in the system, as opposed to other religions that
have nothing like it. My only problem is that it was used to abuse
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether other women will take up the cudgels remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this will open the floodgates,'' said Susan
Aronoff, co-director of Agunah Inc., which helps women whose
husbands refuse to grant them a get and is organizing a fund to
help Mrs. Lightman pay her legal expenses. ``But maybe it will make
rabbis more careful of their conduct.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani on Sunday defended the
increasing use of video surveillance, saying that residents have
been clamoring for more security cameras to watch out for crime in
public spaces.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani was responding to a study released over the weekend by
the New York Civil Liberties Union, which found that at least 2,397
surveillance cameras were trained on public streets, sidewalks,
buildings and parks in Manhattan. The study recommended that the
city regulate the use of surveillance cameras to make sure they do
not unnecessarily violate people's privacy.
</P>
<P>
   But the mayor said the city was careful not to use video
surveillance too liberally. Of the 2,397 surveillance cameras
counted in the study, only about 400 were operated by government
agencies. The rest were operated by private organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that we use cameras very modestly,'' Giuliani said
Sunday when asked about the study at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani also said that video surveillance had become an
effective and popular crime-fighting tool in public housing
projects, where the city began installing cameras last year. Only
three of the city's 342 housing developments have surveillance
cameras so far, said Hilly Gross, a spokesman for the city's
Housing Authority. But the Police Department is planning to install
cameras at six more developments next year as part of a pilot
project, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Installing surveillance cameras in housing projects extends to
some of the city's poorest residents a security measure enjoyed by
residents of luxury apartment buildings, Giuliani said. He said the
city had surveyed residents of housing projects and found that 85
percent were in favor of video surveillance.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, the executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, said his group did not want to abolish video
surveillance, but rather to encourage public discussion of it.
</P>
<P>
   The city should limit how long material recorded by surveillance
cameras could be kept before it is destroyed, he said. It should
also limit access to material recorded by surveillance cameras, and
require that signs be posted near all such cameras to warn people
that they are being watched, Siegel said.

COWBOYS' SKID THREATENS NFC EAST LEAD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Just as they have the past three games, the
Cowboys found themselves in the downtrodden losers' locker room
yesterday trying to put a spin on a disappointing loss.
</P>
<P>
   One that prevented the Cowboys from clinching the playoffs for
the third consecutive week. One that saw them again play without
injured All-Pro cornerback Deion Sanders. And one that saw their
luster as a legitimate Super Bowl contender further tarnished.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, after yesterday's 20-17 loss to the Chiefs (6-8) at
Arrowhead Stadium, the Cowboys are no longer an absolute certainty
for the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, normally talkative receiver Michael Irvin was left
battered and speechless. And usually positive Cowboys coach Chan
Gailey admitted that his team had digressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing we lost three in a row,'' said Irvin, who
was sidelined in the second quarter with a lower back contusion.
``To a man, it's disappointing. We expect to \Rturn it around\S.
...I just don't know what to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Gailey: ``We challenged our team about seven weeks ago to
get on a roll and win a few. We've almost set ourselves back to
that point again. That's not a good feeling. We've got to regroup
and fight our way into the playoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys (8-6) hold only a one-game lead over the Arizona
Cardinals (7-7) in the NFC East with two games to left. They still
have an easy road _ considering that they need only one victory in
the final two home games against the Philadelphia Eagles (3-11) or
the Washington Redskins (5-9) or a Cardinals loss to clinch the
title.
</P>
<P>
   However, in what appears to be more trend than aberration,
nothing is assured for the Cowboys _ unless you count a suddenly
punchless passing attack, a departed running game and an inability
to mount a consistent pass rush.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Emmitt Smith was a nonfactor on the ground for the
third consecutive week. His 50-yard outing followed 44-yard and
6-yard efforts against the Minnesota Vikings and New Orleans
Saints, respectively. The pass offense fared only slightly better
than last week's poor showing against the Saints.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman, already handcuffed by the absence of receiver Ernie
Mills, was understandably further troubled without Irvin. He passed
for 199 yards _ but just 66 through the first three quarters, when
the Cowboys squandered solid field position and saw their streak of
quarters without a touchdown extended to seven.
</P>
<P>
   Aikman and the Cowboys broke the goose egg in the fourth quarter
with touchdown passes to former Fort Worth Country Day star Patrick
Jeffers (28 yards) and Smith (8 yards) as the Cowboys tried to
rally from a 17-3 deficit. But as Aikman said, ``it was too little,
too late.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been without a lot of people,'' Aikman said. ``But
that's part of the game. You've still got to execute. We just
didn't play well. We came back, but it wasn't enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering the Cowboys' prowess on offense during the month of
November, which saw them roll up at least 30 points four of the
five contests, their problems on that side of the ball are most
troubling to Gailey.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to his dismay against the Chiefs were breakdowns in two
normally strong areas _ run defense and special teams. The Cowboys
had their first punt blocked in 611 tries, dating to 1989 against
the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   And a third-quarter fumble by punt returner Tyrone Hughes helped
the Chiefs break a 3-3 halftime tie and seize the momentum.
</P>
<P>
   That Chiefs' running back Bam Morris rushed for 137 yards and a
touchdown against the Cowboys' seventh-ranked run defense was
blamed on bad tackling. It offset a solid game against the pass by
much-maligned cornerbacks Charlie Williams and Kevin Mathis, who
started for Sanders (sprained toe) and Kevin Smith (back
contusion). Chiefs quarterback Rich Gannon, who passed for six
touchdowns in the past two weeks and led the Chiefs to 31.8 points
per game the past three games, passed for 200 yards and threw no
touchdown passes.
</P>
<P>
   However, in what may be the most indicative trend for the
Cowboys and their playoff chances, the end result was a loss to a
nondivision opponent. They are 2-6 outside the NFC East.
</P>
<P>
   That the Cowboys are 6-0 against their suspect division
opponents gives their playoffs chances a boost going into the final
two games against the Eagles and Redskins. However, their play of
late even has eternally confident Cowboys owner Jerry Jones
part-hopeful and part-confused.
</P>
<P>
   ``My confidence level is a lot higher than it was last year,''
Jones said. Last year the Cowboys ended with a five-game losing
streak, finished 6-10 and missed the playoffs for the first time in
six years. ``But we still have an opportunity,'' he said. ``I see
we are not playing well enough to win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know we have a team that is capable of playing well enough
to win,'' Jones continued. ``I'm certainly not sure we can move the
ball for 30 points a game anymore and without Deion that we've got
enough defense to stop anybody. But I don't know that we can't.''

LAWYER LISTED AS `AMBULANCE-CHASER' LOSES CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rl) 
 By AMY WALDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In 1997, the American Association of University
Women's Legal Advocacy Fund published an updated version of its
directory of lawyers. For all but one of the approximately 275
lawyers listed, the directory's description consisted of a name, an
address and information about areas of expertise and fees.
</P>
<P>
   But for Leonard Flamm, a Manhattan lawyer who specializes in
employment discrimination, the entry in the directory, which lists
lawyers whose services might be useful to the association's
members, included a special note: ``At least one plaintiff has
described Flamm as an `ambulance chaser' with interest only in
`slam-dunk cases.'''
</P>
<P>
   Flamm said he saw red _ and a slam-dunk libel case. He sued in
state court.
</P>
<P>
   The case was transferred to U.S. District Court in Manhattan,
where, last week, Judge Denny Chin dismissed it, ruling that the
statement, as opinion rather than fact, cannot be libelous.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how distasteful'' the description of Flamm was, the
judge wrote, ``it was clearly an expression of opinion protected by
the First Amendment and the New York State Constitution.''
</P>
<P>
   The association's lawyer, Laura Handman, said she was not
surprised by the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Flamm said he was ``very unhappy'' with the ruling. He disagreed
with Chin's reasoning, insisting that the phrase ``ambulance
chaser'' was not an opinion phrase. He noted that ``ambulance
chasing,'' the practice of seeking out injured people in the hope
of representing them, is a misdemeanor under New York State law.
``It's like calling me a robber or rapist, because it's a criminal
act, Flamm said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he believes he has a ``slam-dunk'' appeal.

INDIANA'S TITLE: FROM UKRAINE WITH LOVE
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. _ Indiana was the only team to bring a band and
cheerleaders to the final four of this year's men's soccer
tournament, but more important the Hoosiers also brought the most
efficient group of players.
</P>
<P>
   The Hoosiers won their fourth National Collegiate Athletic
Association title Sunday afternoon by beating Stanford, 3-1, at the
University of Richmond Stadium before a crowd of 15,202 that braved
a steady rain.
</P>
<P>
   The three goals Sunday followed a 4-0 trouncing of Santa Clara
in the semifinals on Friday and made the Hoosiers (23-2) one of the
most productive teams in the finals. The seven goals were the most
scored by a winning team since St. Louis scored 10 in 1963.
</P>
<P>
   The victory also provided some redemption for a team that went
into last year's semifinals as the only undefeated team in the
country and lost to the eventual champion, U.C.L.A. The Hoosiers
kept saying before the semifinals that they learned from last year
and proved it with two marvelous performances this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We exorcised some demons,'' Coach Jerry Yeagley said. ``The
pain we felt from last year was with us for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Dema Kovalenko, Yuri Lavrinenko and Aleksei Korol, the three
Ukrainians who in the last two years have helped Indiana compile a
46-3 record with 148 goals for and 25 against, scored the goals
Sunday afternoon, all in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Kovalenko opened the scoring in the seventh minute with a shot
from 24 yards away after a cross from the right side by Lavrinenko.
The shot in the upper-right corner surprised Adam Zapala, the
Stanford goalkeeper, who was caught about 6 yards away from his
line.
</P>
<P>
   Kovalenko started the second goal with a cross from the right
that reached Korol on the left. Korol touched it into the middle to
Lavrinenko, who pounced on it from close range while the Stanford
defenders raised their hands for an offside call that never came.
</P>
<P>
   The only flaw in Indiana's play was poor distribution out of the
defense, but Stanford (18-5-2) wasn't able to capitalize often
enough. The one time the Cardinal flooded the attacking zone, it
earned a penalty that resulted in a goal in the 22nd minute. Simon
Elliott scored it for his ninth goal of the season.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty came after Nick Garcia, the Indiana sweeper, who was
voted the tournament's outstanding defensive player, wrestled Corey
Woolfolk down in the penalty area.
</P>
<P>
   That brought the Cardinal to 2-1, but Korol, who was voted the
outstanding offensive player in the tournament, scored his 17th of
the year with 48 seconds left before intermission, pouncing on a
loose ball on the left after it was mis-hit by Indiana's Matt
Fundenberger. The goal brought despair to the Cardinal because it
was the first time all year that Stanford had allowed three goals
in a game, let alone a half.
</P>
<P>
   ``That third goal killed us,'' Stanford Coach Bobby Clark said.
``It's the sign of a great team to have guys with half a chance
that put it away.'' &QL;

NEW EDITOR'S GOAL IS TO BE THE TOP `CATS'
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Call it a cat fight. Since September, Jane Reilly has been
editor of Cats magazine, which is published by Primedia Inc., and
the January issue _ that's the one with the proud cover line ``Hero
Cat Saves Family'' _ is the first one that is a product entirely of
her editorial vision.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Reilly's mission: to enter into a mewling, scratching battle
with the behemoth of the cat magazines, Cat Fancy, which is
published by Fancy Publications.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Reilly says that she feels she has enough power behind her
to wrestle Cat Fancy into that great litter box in the sky. Her
father is William Reilly, the chairman and chief executive of
Primedia.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the job at Cats came up, I thought, `It's a cat magazine.
Do I want to edit a cat magazine?' '' Ms. Reilly said. ``But I am
passionate about cats.'' And she does not feel awkward about
working for her father. ``My dad on some level is so far above this
magazine that I don't feel his presence,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Cats magazine had an average circulation of 118,127 for the
six-month period that ended in June, according to the Audit Bureau
of Circulations, while Cat Fancy had 272,870. Both bimonthly
magazines are priced at $2.95.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Cat Fancy does a good job,'' Ms. Reilly said. ``But we
are going to take the reader farther.''
</P>
<P>
   Cat Fancy's publisher, Norman Ridker, said: ``They're a
billion-and-half-dollar company. Sure they can take us on.'' Ridker
added that Fancy Publications had filed a $12 million lawsuit in
Federal court in Los Angeles against Cats for a variety of
copyright infringements.
</P>
<P>
   A Primedia spokesman, David Adler, said that Primedia was not
concerned about the lawsuit. ``They are trying to use the courts to
stifle fair competition,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Ms. Reilly is concerned about other matters.
She said there was only one potential downside to editing Cats.
</P>
<P>
   ``All my friends say, `You'll never have a date again,''' Ms.
Reilly said. ``There's this terrible stigma about single women and
cats.''

ON THE NATURE OF WONDER IN `WIT' AND `STOP KISS'

 By MARGO JEFFERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Wonder'' is an interesting word. But whether as verb or noun,
we use it pretty tepidly most of the time. Is he telling the truth?
I wonder. Or, consider the wonders of modern science and
technology. The more primal meaning is pretty hard to come by, as
in to marvel, to be awestruck, possibly to be terrified, seized by
delight and disbelief. Overwhelmed by something new to everything
you have ever experienced. You don't master the source of wonder;
rather, you grow still in its presence and let it take you over. It
asks a lot of us. No wonder we let ourselves experience it so
seldom.
</P>
<P>
   Still, we can't help feeling wonder in the presence of death.
(Don't worry, I'm not about to recite that litany intoned by the
wise old doctor at the beginning of every ``Ben Casey'' episode,
``Man, woman, birth, death, infinity.'') And we can't help feeling
wonder in the presence of great art.
</P>
<P>
   Both death and art drive Margaret Edson's play ``Wit.'' ``Wit''
was denied a Broadway house (the subject matter didn't have legs,
one producer explained), but it has moved into the Union Square
Theater and will doubtless move on to the regional theaters.
</P>
<P>
   Death be not proud, though some have called thee
</P>
<P>
   Mighty and dreadfull, for, thou art not soe,
</P>
<P>
   For, those, whom thou think'st, thou dost overthrow,
</P>
<P>
   Die not, poore death, nor yet canst thou kill mee.
</P>
<P>
   These lines are from the ``Holy Sonnets'' of the 17th-century
poet John Donne. The character who speaks them in ``Wit'' is Vivian
Bearing, Ph.D., a literary scholar whose work on Donne, she
declares, was groundbreaking.
</P>
<P>
   A sonnet is theater at its most condensed. You have one speaker
who is of two minds, you have a rigorous structure, and you have
language that can go from the most airborne and elegant to acute,
even wanton emotional extremes. (Ms. Edson is not the only writer
to understand this. For last season's ``Love's Fire,'' the Acting
Company commissioned short plays by seven playwrights, each taking
a sonnet by Shakespeare as its point of departure. I'm also told
that sonnet snatches drift through the new film ``Shakespeare in
Love.'')
</P>
<P>
   Now Vivian is battered by cancer and chemotherapy: the disease
and the cure fight for her body as salvation and damnation fought
for Donne's soul. And as the poet turned his struggle into verse,
the professor turns hers into theater. (Don't forget that a
``theater'' isn't only a place for staging plays: it is a lecture
hall, a surgical clinic or a center for war operations.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Edson doesn't try to compete with Donne's volatile
brilliance. Who can compete with lines like:
</P>
<P>
   Take mee to you, imprison mee, for I
</P>
<P>
   Except you'enthrall mee, never shall be free,
</P>
<P>
   Nor ever chast, except you ravish mee.
</P>
<P>
   What she and the masterly actress Kathleen Chalfant provide is a
prose correlative. When Vivian Bearing speaks in her high-handed,
high-minded way, she shapes and controls her revelations as surely
as any poet. And, like Donne, she deploys wit, not so much to make
us laugh (though we do sometimes), but to make us see the grace of
paradox and contradiction under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Ms. Chalfant as Vivian, I realized we've come to
believe that dying and death are much more convincing on film than
on stage. We think verisimilitude is everything: the shadowed face,
the hollowed eyes, the close-ups of suffering. (Think of Meryl
Streep in ``One True Thing'' or Tom Hanks in ``Philadelphia.'')
</P>
<P>
   But if you've ever watched someone die over a long period of
time, physical decay isn't always the first thing to get to you.
It's the way death ambushes, wears down the person you know, the
way she or he becomes nothing more than certain extreme traits or
moods. Furious one day, benign the next, terrified then uncannily
brave. But always growing farther away from you. To sit watching in
a dark theater as we might in a hospital room is hair-raising. Film
absorbs you at moments like these, but theater implicates you.
</P>
<P>
   And that sense of being implicated _ drawn despite yourself,
even against your will to something that unsettles or frightens you
_ is what the audience shares with the young female protagonists of
``Stop Kiss,'' the romantic comedy by Diana Son playing to such
eager audiences at the Joseph Papp Public Theater. I said romantic
comedy, but this one is threatened by tragedy. When the two people
falling in love belong to one sex, a kiss is a very dangerous
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Romantic tragedies are about what's forbidden. A couple break
society's rules and at least one of them pays with death. Romantic
comedies are about the unplanned. A couple thwart social
expectations and don't so much change the rules as change who plays
the game and how. Society accommodates them. Life goes on.
</P>
<P>
   Contemporary writers are having a hard time with romantic
comedy. The energy that draws two people together and the
circumstances that push them apart aren't combustible enough. Your
average scenario involves two people who quarrel, maybe in the
office, maybe on a blind date. Since they're both attractive we
know they're going to fall in love. And the world they live in is
too flat. The best romantic comedies (``It Happened One Night,''
``The Lady Eve'') didn't just have stars, they supplied great minor
characters and reasonably complicated settings.
</P>
<P>
   This particular one includes whites, blacks and Asians, who
don't, for the time we see them, talk race. I have no problem with
that. My world includes all those groups, and we spend a lot of
time talking about other complicated things.
</P>
<P>
   The old roles and rules are pretty much gone now. The desires
are all still there, but we (writers and citizens) don't know how
to combine them with new uncertainties and possibilities. This is
what ``Stop Kiss'' does so well. It is a small, well-wrought play
with nary a false move except for occasional too-cute banter.
</P>
<P>
   Now here is wonder on a smaller scale, for surely it is wondrous
strange, as the Elizabethans would say, when two people who have no
intention of falling in love find themselves unable to do anything
else. Callie and Sara aren't thinking about love or lesbians when
they meet. Romance takes them by surprise, and this time it's not
the verbal sparring but the camaraderie that fools them. (We see
the signs before they do.)
</P>
<P>
   Romance requires the sense that one's feelings are very strange
yet very familiar. All of that is intensified here by sexual unease
_ the audience's as well as the characters' _ and outright
violence. Callie and Sara do want to delay acknowledging what they
feel, but they don't want to feel any other way. For all its
dangers, it's too pleasurable. Or, as Ira Gershwin said, `` 'S
Wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   There's a fine line here between what we might call the
universal (romance whatever the specifics of gender and sexuality)
and the particular (two women in love). What threatens Callie and
Sara is very particular. But it makes you ask yourself more general
questions, like: What am I willing to risk for love? What is the
bearable ratio of fear to delight? What does the person I love make
me think and feel about the world and about myself? And am I
willing to live with that?

CONN . OFFICIALS SAY DEAL REACHED ON STADIUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD _ Moving ever closer to providing a new home for the
New England Patriots, Connecticut Governor John G. Rowland and six
ranking legislative leaders Sunday said they had reached an
agreement on the terms of a $375 million stadium financing deal.
</P>
<P>
   All predicted the General Assembly will approve the deal
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Their renewed confidence hung on new language in the proposal,
which will make it even tougher for the Patriots to leave
Connecticut and decrease the state's exposure on premium seating
guarantees by $4 million annually. After reviewing those details,
Rowland and the legislators emerged from the Governor's Mansion and
said the deal is largely done.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all standing here, our bipartisan leadership, in total
agreement on this stadium proposal, in total agreement on the
legislation that we will present,'' Rowland said. ``We all have a
proposal now that we can move forward with, and I think it's going
to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic legislators _ including House Speaker Thomas D.
Ritter of Hartford, Senate President Pro Tem Kevin B. Sullivan of
West Hartford, and even a stubborn skeptic, House Majority Leader
Moira Lyons of Stamford _ echoed the governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pleased with the changes, I think they have been
significant changes,'' said Lyons, making her first announcement
that she will vote in favor of the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am usually skeptical about making predictions, but, for the
first time today, I think I feel confident that it will pass in the
Senate,'' said Sullivan. ``I think that what we can say to our
colleagues is that we listened to them, we took their issues back
to the conversation and got results. More importantly, what our
colleagues can say to their constituents is that we listened to
you, too, and we made the changes you need to see in this deal to
make it best for Connecticut.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Patriots owner Robert Kraft and his son Jonathan were
not available for comment Sunday, because of the team's upset loss
to the St. Louis Rams and the beginning of Hanukkah, Rowland said
they were in agreement with the changes.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said the new provisions resulted from ``concessions
and agreements with the Kraft family and the team,'' and that he
had merely informed Robert Kraft of the positive response of
legislators in a 10-minute telephone call to St. Louis Sunday
during the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very pleased with the response of the Krafts in allaying
our concerns,'' Rowland said. ``Many expected us to come to some
movement on the guarantees and we have done so, which makes this
product a lot more palatable to the legislators on Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   In a proposed bill released last week, Kraft and the Patriots
would have been bound to Connecticut for the duration of a 30-year
lease on the new stadium through a legal declaration that moving
the team would have presented an ``irreparable harm'' to the state,
for which it could not be compensated by money or any other means.
Rowland's office and legislative staff saw the so-called exit
provisions as ironclad, essentially laying out a legally
enforceable position from which the Patriots could not withdraw.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland and the legislative leaders announced Sunday that the
bill will now call on the Patriots to pay the state for all of the
benefits the team has received and the state has derived from the
stadium if the Krafts ever sell the team or leave the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to make sure that the taxpayers' interest was
protected over the next 30 years should the Patriots decide to
leave, and the exit agreement is very, very stiff,'' Rowland said.
``If they were to leave in any way, shape or form, or sell the
team, the penalty for them would be the total value or total
benefit to the state. So that runs up into the hundreds and
hundreds of million dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill also had formulated state guarantees for luxury boxes
and club seats that would have essentially required the state to
pay for some of the premium seating that the Patriots could not
sell.
</P>
<P>
   The state's maximum exposure over the first 10 years of the
agreement was $17.5 million per year, and Rowland said Sunday that
the Patriots had been provided with language that could have
extended some of the guarantees over the 30 years. Those guarantees
made the deal one of the most lucrative offered to an NFL owner,
and they have been among the provisions most criticized by the
legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland and the legislative leaders said Sunday that they had
agreed with Kraft to lower the total annual exposure to $13
million.
</P>
<P>
   Under the first draft of the bill and the memorandum of
understanding Rowland and Kraft signed on Nov. 19, the state would
have been responsible for 4,000 of the 6,000 club seats at 50
percent of the $5,000 price tag . Connecticut also would have been
responsible for the full cost of 75 of the 125 to 150 luxury
suites, which are to sell at $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   As reported in the Globe Sunday, the final bill will reduce the
cost of the club seats to $4,000. That reduces the state's exposure
by $2 million per year, Rowland and the legislative leaders said.
</P>
<P>
   The state will now guarantee only 50 percent of the cost of the
last 75 to 100 luxury suites for sale, a savings of $2.5 million on
the potential cost of the guarantee, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is going to be very helpful to legislators who
were either on the fence or perhaps wanted to vote for this plan
but felt that the guarantees were too much of a risk for the
state,'' Rowland said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Patriots could have imposed the guarantees over the
lifetime of the lease, Rowland said, the potential savings to the
state are substantial.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at it over a period of 30 years, if you look at
the inflation and the increase of the ticket prices over 30 years,
that reduces the exposure of the guarantees by as much as $350
million,'' Rowland said.
</P>
<P>
   The legislators met with Rowland and some members of his staff
for about four hours Sunday before announcing the agreement. All
said they will speak to their Democratic and Republican caucuses,
and will push today for approval of the bill in its new form.

PARALYZED GUARD DOESN'T REGRET TRYING TO SAVE SUICIDAL WOMAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY LISA VAN PROYEN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Calling him a hero, hundreds of strangers and
friends have written Conrad Buchanan and visited him in the
hospital in the month since he broke his neck trying to catch a
woman who jumped six stories from a parking garage.
</P>
<P>
   Although the critical injuries have devastated his family,
Buchanan and some of his relatives said he has no regrets that he
tried to save a life.
</P>
<P>
   One of Buchanan's deeply moved visitors was Jon Light, the son
of the 68-year-old suicidal woman who leaped from the garage of the
Sherman Oaks Galleria in the suburban San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In the eight days after his cancer-stricken mother carried out
her death wish, Light said he was drawn to Buchanan's bedside to
see what he could do to acknowledge the split-second decision for
self-sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   ``After my mom died, that was hard. I just wanted to see how he
was doing,'' said Light, a 41-year-old attorney from Camarillo,
Calif., in neighboring Ventura County. ``I feel terrible for the
guy. He tried to do a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   They sat together for several hours. Buchanan is now paralyzed
from the neck down and has difficulty speaking. But his sister said
Light's visits have been good for the 26-year-old security guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``My brother likes him,'' Melva Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   She said trying to help others is so characteristic of her
brother that his family was not surprised by his selfless act.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was the right thing to do. I think he would have
been traumatized if he had just sat there and not done anything,''
she said. ``He doesn't have any regrets. That was something that he
had to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Light has helped Buchanan's family set up a trust fund for
Buchanan's wife and two daughters, 5 years old and 8 months old.
Light said he and his family plan to contribute thousands of
dollars to the fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just feel like we should do something,'' Light said.
</P>
<P>
   Since his first visit, Light has returned twice to see Buchanan
at Northridge Hospital Medical Center and calls the Buchanan family
for updates regularly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that he got hurt would have devastated my mother. She
helped people all the time. It just would have been a nightmare for
her, I'm sure,'' Light said.
</P>
<P>
   Light's family held a memorial Sunday at his sister's house to
reflect on Julie Light's life.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime Sherman Oaks resident, she appeared regularly during
the 1950s as an actress in Hallmark Hall of Fame commercials. More
recently, she became severely depressed because of cancer and the
death in 1997 of her husband, Robert Light, 85, a former actor and
president of the Southern California Broadcasters Association.
</P>
<P>
   It all became too much for her to bear. On Nov. 15, she climbed
to the top of the parking garage, looked down and tried to warn
those below her to move out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, making his rounds as a security guard, refused to
move.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just a caring person,'' his sister said. ``He's always
helping other people. If someone is down and under and they need
him to do something, he's always there. That's how he is. You could
always ask him to do favors.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, who grew up and lives in downtown Los Angeles, would
never turn his back on somebody in danger, even if he knew he would
be risking his own life, his sister explained.
</P>
<P>
   As Light plummeted, Buchanan positioned himself to break her
fall from the top level of the parking structure, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The impact broke Light's back and Buchanan's neck. She died
later that night at a hospital, and police found a suicide note in
her car saying she was suffering great pain from cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan underwent neck surgery last week and is now in stable
condition and recovering, his sister said. Doctors are unsure
whether he will be paralyzed for life, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll just have to wait and see how he reacts,'' she said.
``He's alert. It's just rough for him.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her brother is capable of making decisions for himself
and can communicate.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's neighbor Gabrielle Stewart-Eastland, who went to
church with him and his family almost daily, said he is a devoted
husband and father whose smile always won friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an incredible person,'' she said. Just a week before the
tragedy, he saw her putting antifreeze into her car and routinely
stopped his car to see if she was having trouble, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just the type of person he is. . . . He wanted to make
sure everything was OK,'' Stewart-Eastland said.
</P>
<P>
   She said he has a reputation for being a good neighbor. Many
tenants from his apartment complex have visited him in the
hospital, and ministers from his church have prayed with his family
at his bedside, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow guards and mall merchants and employees also visit, she
said, with gifts and toys for his children.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us feel terrible. . . . He's had a lot of visitors, a
lot of care, a lot of expressions of hope,'' Stewart-Eastland said.
</P>
<P>
   Her brother appreciates the community support, Melva Buchanan
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to thank everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The family has asked that anyone wishing to make donations to
Buchanan and his family write to Conrad Buchanan Donations, P.O.
Box 7362, Los Angeles, CA 90007.

JETS DEFEAT DOLPHINS, 21-16

<P>
   MIAMI _ In their 30th game of the Bill Parcells regime, the New
York Jets became a playoff team on Sunday night. It had been seven
years since they last saw post-season play.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did they guarantee themselves a playoff spot with a
21-16 breathtaking victory over the Dolphins, punctuated by an
action-packed final quarter, but the Jets positioned themselves
grandly for their first division title since 1969.
</P>
<P>
   The victory lifted the Jets' record to 10-4 and put them alone
in first place in the American Football Conference East as the
Dolphins fell to 9-5. If the Jets win one of their final two games
_ at Buffalo and in the Meadowlands against the Patriots _ they
will take the division title.
</P>
<P>
   They are also in a good position to earn a first-round bye with
their 10 victories, the first time since 1986 the Jets have
produced a double-digit season.
</P>
<P>
   After the Jets had taken a 14-3 lead, the teams played a furious
final period.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Marino brought the Dolphins to the Jets' 10-yard line but
then was intercepted by Victor Green, who returned the ball 87
yards to the Miami 9.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets' victory seemed assured. Fans even started to stream
out, prompting a Miami die-hard to yell, ``How can you people
leave!''
</P>
<P>
   But Green's big play was one of several to come before this game
would end.
</P>
<P>
   For Vinny Testaverde was intercepted in the end zone by Terrell
Buckley. Buckley was guarding Keyshawn Johnson, who had scored
against him the first time these teams met.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley returned the ball 61 yards to the Jets' 41. From there,
Marino launched a touchdown drive that ended with a 3-yard scoring
pass to O.J. McDuffie. The extra point made it 14-10.
</P>
<P>
   Now it really got interesting. The Dolphins' Olindo Mare
delivered an onside kick that Miami recovered. But Marino could not
get anything going, failing on a fourth-down pass. The Jets took
over and appeared secure, with Testaverde running for a pair of
first downs. But the Jets' top runner, Curtis Martin, fumbled the
ball back.
</P>
<P>
   Not for long, though. Ernie Logan produced the fifth Jets' sack
of Marino _ the most times he had been knocked down by them in his
career _ and the ball popped loose.
</P>
<P>
   Along came Chad Cascadden, who has a photograph of himself
sacking Marino in the first game this season. The linebacker picked
up the ball and returned it 23 yards for the crushing score.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins scored in the final seconds, and then the Jets fell
on another onside kick.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder Jimmy Johnson asked the Dolphins' fans to cheer extra
loud on Sunday night. At times, the Jets' supporters nearly drowned
them out, south Florida having always had a huge New York sports
following.
</P>
<P>
   It was a raucous crowd, dominated by Dolphins fans, at the start
of the game. But often they were quieted by what was happening on
the field as the Jets took a 7-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins, 6-0 at home coming in, weren't accustomed to this
sort of disrespectful behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde and Wayne Chrebet generated several long plays in the
opening half, including a 52-yarder in the first period. On the
next play, Testaverde hooked up with Chrebet again on a 12-yard
touchdown pass, as the receiver was able to get into one-on-one
coverage with the hefty linebacker Robert Jones. That score more
than offset Olindo Mare's 24-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Bryan Cox created some excitement in his first game
back here as Jet. He sacked Marino on a solo tackle and then teamed
with Cascadden to dump him again. Cox, who left here after the 1995
season with Jimmy Johnson's arrival, also knocked down a Marino
pass.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde also had a homecoming. The Heisman Trophy winner from
the University of Miami collaborated with Kyle Brady on the tight
end's s longest career catch, a 35-yarder, in the third period.
That set up a 9-yard Curtis Martin run, helped by blocks from his
wide receivers, for a 14-3 edge.

OFF THE WALL: WELL, BUST MY BILLFOLD

<P>
   &LR; Got a tiny piece of AD-vice for small-minded, short-sighted and
short-changed San Diego Padres owner John Moores, and it won't cost
nothin':
</P>
<P>
   Quit dodgin' the real issue here.
</P>
<P>
   Your rent-to-own deal with Kevin Brown expired, and you
unfortunately lost him to The Most Powerful Man in Sports who needs
to save face and happens to own a private jet.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't a small-market-vs.-big-market situation. If !ital!you
had the resources to sign him, you'd have pulled it off yourself
(see: Phoenix, cross reference Colangelo).
</P>
<P>
   It's not ``a truly tragic day for baseball.'' That would be
something along the lines of blackmailing the city's citizens to
fund your new stadium during the euphoria of a league title.
</P>
<P>
   And this doesn't confirm your worst fears about what would
happen if you let Rupert Murdoch buy the Dodgers. Your worst fear
already happened: You lost your money starter to an NL West foe
after allowing Ken Caminiti and Steve Finley to slip away, and
watching defected pitching coach Dave Stewart lure Joey Hamilton to
Toronto in a deal that doesn't include Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   (At least you got John Vander Wal locked in!)
</P>
<P>
   Just hand over the pink slip and call yourself prudent for not
giving $100 mil to someone who's !ital!arguably the best at what he
does.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get swept up in Rupert-bashing as you got swept in the
Series against the Yankees. Go clip your coupons and trade in your
pop bottles and invest in a few hungry players. (Hey, wait, what
day is today? Oh, darn, you missed the 39-cent cheeseburger deal at
McDonalds again). . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ P.S.: You owe Randy Myers about $12 million over the next two
years. Maybe convert him into a starter?
</P>
<P>
   __ P.S.S.: Still wanna pull the trigger on that Greg Vaughn
deal?. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ More than 80 percent of the 23,000-plus voters on an ESPN.com
insta-poll declared Brown isn't worthy of being the first baseball
player to earn $100 million. Who is? Don't know. It was just a
yes-or-no question. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ By the way, by Forbes magazine's recent guestimation, the
Dodgers franchise was worth $236 million _ about $100 mil more than
what Murdoch shelled out for 'em last spring. See a trend there? .
. .
</P>
<P>
   __ Brown is 6-0 lifetime against San Francisco with an ERA of
less than 0.60, including a no-hitter against them in '97. Barry
Bonds' lifetime average against him is .143 (3 for 21). . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ Another Brown stat to gnaw on: Over the last four years, his
record in September is 12-4 with a 2.20 ERA. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ Gary Sheffield is 7 for 14 with six RBI lifetime against
Brown. As if that matters. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ Back to the latest 100 Most Powerful People in Sports list
released by The Sporting News, which placed Murdoch on top as he
was in '94 and '95: Chase Carey, the Dodgers' top dog and CEO of
Fox TV, followed Murdoch's coattails by jumping from No. 30 last
year to No. 6 this time. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ Meanwhile, NBC Sports chief Dick Ebersol and Time Warner VP
Ted Turner, scheming to form a new pro football league, continue to
slip from the pedestal where once they stood. Ebersol, No. 1 in
'96, dropped to No. 10; Turner, No. 1 in '94, settled in at No. 13.
. . .
</P>
<P>
   __ Everyone knows the Giants are better than the Broncos. . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ Sunday's quote of the day came from Fox NFL studio
straight-man Howie Long. After Terry Bradshaw went off on a rant
about how he doesn't favor instant replay _ ``I just don't believe
in a perfect game . . . we need controversy'' _ Long replied, ``How
do you feel about indoor plumbing and electricity?'' . . .
</P>
<P>
   __ Chicago wants a second NFL team and mayor Richard Daley says
the Raiders are welcomed to come over and use Comiskey Park.
Somehow, Al Davis and the Windy City seem like a perfect match.
