<HEADLINE> Roundup: Syrian-Israeli Negotiations Embark on New Phase (Part 1) (by Wang Genbao) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Damascus, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The resuming of Syrian-Israeli
peace talks in Maryland, the United States, in late December has
witnessed a new phase of Syrian-Israeli track of the peace process
after a six-month stalemate.
</P>
<P>
In a further development, the reopen of the second round of
Syrian-Israeli talks Wednesday also indicated that all of the
major substantive issues are now on the table and both sides are
seeking to find ways to push forward the talks.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators for Israel and Syria have said the talks were being
held in a positive atmosphere though many difficult discussions
are expected before the long-time adversaries are to strike a
peace deal.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace talks during the year of 1995 had
undergone several zigzag phases of developments. "It was in a
stage of slumber," said Syrian President Hafez al-Assad last
September.
</P>
<P>
Chief of Staff of the Syrian Armed Forces Hikmat Shihabi and
his Israeli counterpart Amnon Shahak had held meetings at a
military base near Washington between June 27 and 30.
</P>
<P>
These meetings revealed big gap between the stances of Syria
and Israel, prominent among which is the establishment of early
warning systems after proposed Israeli withdrawal from the Golan
Heights, a strategic plateau Israel captured from Syria in the
1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Syria adamantly rejects the installation. Syrian President
al-Assad has declared in clear-cut terms: "No to the land warning
stations, even the peace process are to collapse."
</P>
<P>
In view of this firm Syrian attitude, late Israeli Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin had decided to suspended the negotiations
until April 1996.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, for four consecutive years, on-and-off
talks between Syria and Israel have failed to resolve difference
over conditions for Israeli withdrawal from the Golan.
</P>
<P>
Likewise, Syria rejected any further military talks following
the June negotiations between the Syrian and Israeli chiefs of
staff.
</P>
<P>
Syria had even expressed its indignation at Israel's demand to
maintain early warning stations at the Syrian side after Israeli
pullout from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
But the situation has changed since Shimon Peres became prime
minister after the assassination of Rabin in last November.
</P>
<P>
No sooner that Peres had formed his new government than he
began sending positive signals to the Syrian leaders. He had on
several occasions indicated hope that complete peace with syria
could be attained in the no distant future, saying that peace with
Syria and Lebanon would mean peace with 18 to 20 Arab
states. Hence, an end to the state of belligerence.
</P>
<P>
On its part, Syria considered such new Israeli positions as
"positive," and is aware that there was a difference between the
stances of Rabin and those of Peres. Accordingly, Damascus views
Peres as being more open to the peace process than his predecessor
Rabin. The Syrian President is on record as saying " I see that
Peres wishes to deal with better openness."

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Pursues One-China Policy, Says President </HEADLINE>

<P>

</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 5 (Xinhua) -- President Benjamin Mkapa
said here today the Tanzanian government pursues the one-China
policy, commending China for its support to Tanzania's economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with Chinese Ambassador to Tanzania Xie Youkun at
State House, Mkapa said such support has played a big role in
promoting the social and economic development in the country.
</P>
<P>
"We could not forget such support and assistance to us
provided by China," he told the ambassador. "As the third
president of Tanzania, I will do my best to consolidate and
develop the friendly co-operation existing between Tanzania and
China," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two sides discussed political and
economic cooperation between Tanzania and China.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa said Tanzania is pursuing an open policy on economic
development by allowing the private sector to take a prominent
place in commerce and industry, as opposed to the hitherto
existing monopoly by the public sector, a system that could no
longer be sustained by the government.
</P>
<P>
Mkapa wished that Chinese investors would explore areas of
cooperation with Tanzanian entrepreneurs in agriculture, tourism,
mining, industry and trade.

<HEADLINE> UK Imposes Visa Restrictions On Tanzanians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain's decision to
demand entry visa from Tanzanians is partly aimed at checking the
influx of asylum seekers, an official from the British High
Commission said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The introduction of a visa requirement, which should speed up
clearance for bona fide travellers, is a direct reaction to the
increasing number of bogus asylum seekers from Tanzania," the
official said, adding that the British Home Office has made the
visa requirement "effective today".
</P>
<P>
Under the newly imposed requirement, all Tanzanian visitors to
the United Kingdom will have to prove that they qualify for
admission before travelling.
</P>
<P>
However, Tanzanian nationals settled in UK are exempted from
visa when returning back after an absence of not more than two
years.
</P>
<P>
According to recent reports, about 200 Tanzanians from the
opposition parties have sought asylum in the United Kingdom
since last October's gerneral eletions in Tanzania.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Raise Domestic Postage Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Postal Corp.
(Philpost) will raise domestic postage rates from 2 pesos (0.08 US
dollar) to 4 pesos (0.16 US dollars) per 20 grams starting January
6 to cover higher operational costs.
</P>
<P>
The rate increase was approved by the Department of
Transportation and Communications last December.
</P>
<P>
Postmaster General Ireneo Intia said today that 4 pesos would
be charged for the next 20 grams or even a fraction thereof.
</P>
<P>
International postage rates, however, are to retain stable "for
the time being."
</P>
<P>
"The increase is long overdue," Deputy Postmaster General
Felipe Hidalgo said, based on a study by auditing firm SGV and
Co., the postal company spends about 3.51 pesos (0.14 US dollars)
for every letter posted, while senders pay only 2 pesos.
</P>
<P>
With the recent increase in fuel prices, the costs of
delivering mail are expected to climb further.
</P>
<P>
Unless rates are adjusted, Philpost would incur mounting
losses, Intia explained.

<HEADLINE> New Kwazulu/Natal Commission Slammed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The announcement of a new
multi-party commission to investigate political violence in South
Africa's Kwazulu/Natal sparked a verbal battle on Thursday
between political parties in the Province.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of the commission was announced on Wednesday
by Kwazulu/Natal provincial Government Premier Frank Mdlalose.
</P>
<P>
Mdlalose said the commission was one of series of measures
aimed at fighting the ongoing violence in the province and would
hopefully bring stability to the country's most volatile area.
</P>
<P>
Mdlalose's announcement followed an upsurge in political
violence in Kwazulu/Natal over the past few weeks, highlighted by
the Christmas Day massacre at Shobashobane near Port Shepstone,
where 20 people were hacked to death.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Ulundi on Wednesday, Mdlalose said
the commission would serve as a board structure to report on the
circle of violence that continued to plague in the province.
</P>
<P>
Mdlalose said the commission would report to the province's
Department of Safety and Security and had been approved by
members of the Kwazulu/Natal Executive Council.
</P>
<P>
"The government of Kwazulu/Natal is determined to stamp out,
once and for all, political intolerance and violence that goes
with it," he added.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the announcement, both the African National
Congress (ANC) and the South African Communist Party (SACP) in
Kwazulu/Natal condemned the commission as a veiled attempt to
deflect attention away from the Inkatha Freedom Party
(IFP)-initiated violence in the province.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Johannesburg on Thursday, ANC safety
and security spokesman Bheki Cele said the Kwazulu/Natal
Executive Council had never agreed on the formation of the
commission.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Mdlalose lacked the necessary authority to form
such a commission, said Cele.
</P>
<P>
He said: "The resolution of that relevant meeting does not
speak about the commission of inquiry but about the special task
force to investigate the assassination of leaders in the
province."
</P>
<P>
He further stressed that the ANC would support all efforts in
the province aimed at getting to the roots of political killings,
but it refused to be party to cover-ups that would cost millions
of tax payers' money.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in a separate statement, the SACP said the
commission would serve no purpose unless it focussed on specific
incidents.
</P>
<P>
"The SACP South Natal Region views the commission as a joke,"
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
However, in contrast to the widespread criticism, the IFP
welcomed the commission as an important step towards a "common
understanding" about the causes of violence.
</P>
<P>
The IFP also accused the ANC's criticism of the commission as
a proof of the ANC's "culture of selective justice".
</P>
<P>
"If violence is going to be arrested in this province, we call
on the national and provincial government to take more bold and
party politically-blind initiatives such as the one announced by
Premier Mdlalose," added the IFP.

<HEADLINE> French National Assembly President Arrives in Beirut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 5 (Xinhua) -- President of the French National
Assembly Philippe Seguin said here today that the Middle East is
passing an "important and crucial" stage and all the parties
concerned should work hard.
</P>
<P>
Seguin arrived in the Lebanese capital tonight from Paris, on
the first leg of his tour of the region which will also take him
to Israel, the Palestinian self-ruled area of the Gaza Strip,
Egypt, Jordan and Syria.
</P>
<P>
Upon his arrival at the Beirut International Airport, Seguin
stressed the very old and friendly relationship between Lebanon
and France, and expressed his belief that he will be satisfied
with the meetings he will hold with Lebanese officials.
</P>
<P>
He said that "the stage Lebanon and the region is passing
appears important and crucial and we should work hard and
actively."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that optimism for the future can be felt "for the
first time since a long time," and hoped that the parties in the
region will "accustom themselves to the new situation and to the
new cooperation between the two banks of the Mediterranean sea."
</P>
<P>
Receiving the French guest at the airport, Lebanese House
Speaker Nabih Berri said he attached "extreme importance" to
Seguin's visit as this is the first visit by a French house
speaker to Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon is the starting point of Seguin's tour of the region,
"this indicates what an extent the Frenches, especially President
Seguin, are important for Lebanon," the lebanese house speaker
underlined.
</P>
<P>
Talking about Seguin's visit at a press conference earlier
today, Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz pointed to a "big
concern" for Europe generally, and for France particularly, about
what is happening in the region and especially what is occurring
in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He described Seguin's visit as "important" in the light that
it comes at "an important time in the region."
</P>
<P>
Boueiz said that issues of common concern will be raised in
the talks between Seguin and Lebanese leaders, including the
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
"The tradition of the French-Lebanese relations enjoins that
this relationship should be perpetually intimate and perpetually
vigorous," the lebanese foreign minister underlined.
</P>
<P>
During his 24-hour visit to Lebanon, the French house speaker
will hold talks with Lebanese President Elias Hrawi, House Speaker
Nabih Berri, Prime Minister Rafik Al Hariri and Foreign Minister
Farez Boueiz.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Car sales in Britain increased by
1.8 percent in 1995, but the end of year market appeared sluggish,
according to figures published today by the motor industry.
</P>
<P>
A total of new cars registered in Britain in 1995 was 1.95
million, compared to 1.91 million in 1994, said the Society of
Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT).
</P>
<P>
The number of imported cars rose to 58.9 percent of the total
sales, against 57.0 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
But industry analysts expressed dismay on the 1995 figures.
They had expected better results as British economic recovery
matured in the year.
</P>
<P>
In December, only 71,540 new cars were sold, compared to 73,237
in the same period in 1994.
</P>
<P>
"Overall, this was a disappointing end to a disappointing
year," a SMMT official told a press conference.

<HEADLINE> Britain Demands Entry Visas From Tanzanians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Britain has decided to
demand entry visas from Tanzanians visiting the country in an
effort to check an increasing influx of asylum seekers, the
British High Commissioner announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The visa requirement became effective today as opposed to the
original schedule for April 4, 1996, according to a statement
from the British Home Office.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Tanzanians had been permitted to move freely into
Britain without visa requirements as one of the privileges for
being a Commonwealth member state.
</P>
<P>
"The introduction of a visa requirement, which should speed up
clearance for bona fide travelers, is a direct reaction to the
increasing number of bogus asylum seekers from Tanzania," said a
British visa official.
</P>
<P>
However, Tanzanian nationals who have settled in Britain are
exempt from visa clearance when they returned to Britain with
their absence of not more than two years.
</P>
<P>
Also exempt of visa requirement are people on limited period
of work or studies exceeding six months provided they return
before the end of their permission to stay.
</P>
<P>
Since the general elections held in October last year, as many
as 200 Tanzanian opposition party members have saught asylum in
the United Kingdom, raising alarms of the British immigration
authority.

<P>
LUSAKA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Zambia Electoral Commission
will meet here tomorrow to discuss extension of the voters
registration period requested by eight opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Public liaison officer of the commission Joe Sikazwe, who
confirmed the scheduled meeting today, said the commission wishes
to acknowledge receipt of request from some political parties
requesting it to extend the registration of the voters exercise.
</P>
<P>
The commission will release a press statement on results of

</P>
<P>
Eight opposition party leaders Thursday signed a joint
declaration demanding, among other issues, the extension of the
current voters registration until about 4.6 million eligible
voters are registered.
</P>
<P>
The voters registration exercise, which is scheduled to end in
mid-January, has been marred by unprecedented apathy so far. It
is estimated about 20 percent of eligible voters have registered
since the exercise began on December 12 last year.

<HEADLINE> UK Supermarkets Accused of Killing Fruit Growers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- British supermarkets are putting
British fruit and vegetable growers out of business by buying
produce from the Continent, particularly France, delegates to a
conference were told on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Caroline Dumonteil, of the Science Policy Research Unit at
Sussex University said at the annual conference of the Royal
Geographical Society in Glasgow that British supermarkets bullied
suppliers and were "very antagonistic" towards British growers.
</P>
<P>
"Supermarkets want large volumes of identical products which
favors large, technically-able growers and leaves others behind,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
The importing policy by the supermarkets meant the acreage of
fruit and vegetables under cultivation in Britain had shrunk by 16
percent between 1987 and 1993, and 20 percent of growers had gone
out of business.
</P>
<P>
Fourteen percent of apple orchards had disappeared in last year
alone, even though English apples were the same quality as the
French.
</P>
<P>
The domination of supermarkets means they take 60 percent of
retail market, which is expected to grow to 80 percent in the next
four years.
</P>
<P>
The number of independent growers have dropped from 55,000 20
years ago to fewer than 20,000. For the growers this means fewer
wholesale markets, which have fallen from 150 main wholesalers to
37 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Dumonteil said that practices such as this had led to fresh
fruit and vegetables becoming the largest single item contributing
to Britain's trade deficit.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Republicans Agree To Plan To End Shutdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 5 (Xinhua) -- U.S. House Republicans on
Friday agreed to a plan to end a record 21-day partial government
shutdown, that has furloughed hundreds of thousands of federal
workers.
</P>
<P>
Speaker Newt Gingrich, in a terse closed-door speech, said the
burden is now on President Bill Clinton to agree to a balanced
budget that would permanently end the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Republican plan, which headed for a vote today, would
immediately restore 280,000 furloughed workers to their jobs with
full pay through January 26. It would restart the salaries of
480,000 others in unfunded agencies -- who have not been paid
since December 16 when the partial shutdown began.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry said he would withhold
judgment until after the plan passes.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is said would likely sign the measure although he would
prefer a broader back-to-work bill.
</P>
<P>
The House Rules Committee cleared two options for votes. One
would send 280,000 furloughed government employees back to work
with full pay through January 26; return 480,000 others in
unfunded agencies to full pay through that date; and finance a
handful of still-unfunded programs for the entire fiscal year that
began October 1.
</P>
<P>
An alternative bill would fund the entire government through
January 26 at a minimum of 75 percent of last year's spending
levels -- but would be contingent on a seven-year balanced budget
agreement using estimates by the Congressional Budget Office.
</P>
<P>
The legislation also would need to pass the Senate to end the
shutdown.

<HEADLINE> Murayama Tenders Resignation for Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama
said today he is stepping down after 18 months in office so that a
new coalition cabinet can take measures to ensure Japan's economic
recovery and handle other pressing issues with the beginning of
the new year.
</P>
<P>
Murayama, 71, said at a hastily called press conference at his
official residence that he hopes the new cabinet to be formed will
"positively tackle" problems it is facing and "make a new start
with the New Year."
</P>
<P>
Murayama, however, said he is not quitting politics and is
filing his candidacy for reelection to chairman of the Social
Democratic Party (SDP).
</P>
<P>
He said his successor will be decided by his SDP, the Liberal
Democratic Party (LDP) and New Party Sakigake, which make up the
tripartite ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
Murayama did not mention at the press conference International
Trade and Industry Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, who is also LDP
president, as his successor. But political sources said Murayama
is leaning toward handing over the premiership to Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, 58, has signaled his readiness to succeed Murayama.
</P>
<P>
Murayama said earlier that he thought from the beginning that
the prime minister should be elected from the largest coalition
component, the LDP, according to local press reports.
</P>
<P>
The resignation of Murayama as well as the election of
Hashimoto will be approved by an extra Diet (parliament) session
next Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"On the New Year's Day holiday, I recalled the role I had
played," which saw some accomplishments, though not enough,
Murayama said. He then decided to quit, thinking a new team would
produce fresh power to tackle a number of issues, he added.
</P>
<P>
Murayama noted that he wants to maintain the current framework
of the three-party ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
He said the House of Representatives should not be dissolved,
arguing that would produce a political vacuum when measures to
ensure early economic recovery and other issues require prompt
attention.
</P>
<P>
Murayama, who assumed the premiership in June 1994 with the SDP
forming the current ruling coalition with the LDP and Sakigake,
first conveyed his intention to resign in a telephone conversation
with Hashimoto earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
The conversation occurred before Murayama met with Hashimoto,
Sakigake head and Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura and other
coalition leaders.
</P>
<P>
At his news conference, Murayama said he did his best during
his 18-month tenure as prime minister, citing the handling of
World War II-related issues such as compensation for atomic bomb
victims and also for wartime sex slaves, widely known as "comfort
women."
</P>
<P>
During his 18 months in office, Murayama was confronted with a
series of unprecedented events, including the January 17 Great
Hanshin Earthquake which left more than 6,000 people dead, the
March 20 Tokyo subway sarin gassing allegedly by the Aum Shinrikyo
religious cult, and a string of financial scandals.

<P>
TOKYO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi
Murayama in announcing his resignation today, said he hopes that
the current three-party ruling coalition will be maintained.
</P>
<P>
Murayama, who heads the Social Democratic Party (SDP) in the
tripartite ruling coalition, told a news conference at his
official residence that he thought that his successor should be
elected from the largest coalition component, the Liberal

</P>
<P>
It is reported that Murayama's resignation and the selection of
his successor, possibly International Trade and Industry Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto, concurrently the LDP president, will be
approved by a special Diet (parliament) session on January 11.
</P>
<P>
The 71-year-old prime minister also said he decided to quit
during the New Year holidays because there is a political lull in
the country then.
</P>
<P>
During his 18-month tenure, Murayama recalled, he has done "his
best" to deal with World War II-related issues and revive Japan's
economy.
</P>
<P>
Murayama assumed the premiership in June 1994 and formed a
ruling coalition with the conservative LDP and New Party Sakigake,
an LDP splinter headed by Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Calls For Sub-Region News Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzania News Agency
(SHIHATA) is calling for close cooperation between news agencies
in the African sub-region in order to reduce dependence on
other international news agencies.
</P>
<P>
SHIHATA Director Nkwabi Ng'wanakilala said in an appeal on
Thursday: "Let us increase our co-operation in the information
exchange through the use of cultural and information sector of
the Southern African Development Community (SADC)."
</P>
<P>
It is high time the SADC cultural and information sector be
used as platform for reducing dependence on information among the
sub-region countries, the SHIHATA chief stressed.
</P>
<P>
The SADC sector in the sub-region, being co-ordinated by
Mozambique, has not yet fully exploited by its members, and a
more effective use will promote information exchange on political
and economical sphere in the sub-region, according to the chief.
</P>
<P>
The director listed other platforms for such cooperation as
the former East African Community (EAC), the Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) and the Preferential Trade
Area (PTA).

<HEADLINE> Clergy Calls for Purging Westernized Professors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 5 (Xinhua) -- A hardliner clergy here today
called for a purge of Westernized professors and administrators
who criticize religious ideals in their lectures at the
university.
</P>
<P>
Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati, a member of powerful Guardians
Council, strongly condemned the presence of Westernized professors
and administrators in "key positions" of the universities.
</P>
<P>
"There are people in charge at some universities who talk to
American dailies and who speak negatively about the Imam
Khomeini" Jannati told worshippers at Tehran University today.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the statement by the high-ranking
clergyman could be interpreted into a tough stance toward the
anti-clergy trend inside the country.
</P>
<P>
Most importantly, they noted, the ruling clergymen are trying
to thwart the challenge posed by popular technocrats before the
Parliament election falling on March 8 this year under the
anti-US slogans.
</P>
<P>
A university professor said on condition of anonymity that the
teaching staff is regarded as the most dangerous elements who
might join the external groups in the struggle against the
Islamic regime with the support of U.S. government's 20 million
dollar covert operation.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian universities underwent a complete change after the
Islamic Revolution of 1979. Many Marxist and Westernized
professors were purged during the Cultural Revolution after the
Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
Despite the purge during the Cultural Revolution, many
professors at Iran's universities are Western-educated and are in
favor of separation of religion and politics.
</P>
<P>
The most important crusader for the separation of religion and
politics is Abdolkarim Soroush who recently traveled to
Canada. Unconfirmed reports say that Soroush left Iran because
his life was in danger.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily Salam, an opposition daily, published a
letter by Soroush to Iran's Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati,
in which Soroush criticized Velayati for "further endangering" his
life by making irresponsible comments.
</P>
<P>
Velayati had told a group of students in December that
Soroush's ideas had created a problem for Iran in its
international relations.
</P>
<P>
Velayati had also drawn a parallel between Soroush and another
controversial Iranian writer, Ahmad Kasravi who was knifed to
death in the forties for his ideas.

MANILA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today exhorted all government officials to be more aggressive and
create a more dynamic and service-oriented bureaucracy this year.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the president urged the bureaucrats and
rank-and-file employees to exert their best efforts in serving the
Filipino people who deserve "only the best."
</P>
<P>
He further urged the bureaucrats to be more innovative,
creative and flexible, saying "deadwoods are not needed in the
government service."
</P>
<P>
"For this year, we will continue to implement reform measures
that will boost our drive to energize the bureaucracy. Certainly,
deadwoods will be one of our major targets."
</P>
<P>
In his annual report to the nation this week, he said that the
government workforce was further reduced by 6,454 positions from
1,025,914 in 1994 to 1,019,460 in 1995, a decrease of 10 percent.

The reduction was through the strict implementation of the
Attrition Law, mandatory retirement of personnel and agency
specific streamlining and abolition of long-vacant positions.
</P>
<P>
While streamlining the workforce, the government created 20,254
positions for teachers and policemen to respond to the

<HEADLINE> Downfall of Infamous Drug Lord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Although there is still some
confusion about what has actually happened around New Year's day,
what is certain is that the Myanmar government has gained control
of drug warlord Khun Sa's stronghold in the Golden Triangle in
east Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
On New Year's day, Myanmar government troops entered Khun Sa's
stronghold in Ho Mong, Shan state, east Myanmar, without
resistance, an indication that a deal had been struck between
Yangon and Khun Sa, commander of the Mong Tai Army, which had been
fighting for the independence of the Shan state for four decades.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday morning, Mong Tai Army fighters gathered at a
ceremony to lay down their weapons officially in the presence of
2,000 government troops.
</P>
<P>
There have been conflicting reports about Khun Sa's
whereabouts. Some say that he is still in his jungle base, while
others speculate that he is living under government custody.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that Khun Sa, half-Chinese and half-Shan,
tired of warfare and fed up with internal power struggle, had
agreed to surrender to the government in exchange for some kind of
amnesty for himself and his 7,000-strong army.
</P>
<P>
Khun Sa's negotiations with the government had been going on
for some time through his uncle, Khun Hseng.
</P>
<P>
In early December Khun Hseng was taken by a government army
helicopter to see military leaders in Yangon.
</P>
<P>
"In Ho Mong, he (Khun Hseng) is more powerful than Khun Sa,"
said one source.
</P>
<P>
During later stages of negotiations, the government side was
headed by Maung Aye, vice chairman of the State Law and Order
Restoration Council (SLORC) and a former eastern military
commander.
</P>
<P>
About the same time, there had been an informal agreement in
place to halt fighting between the Mong Tai Army and government
forces.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting on December 22, Khun Sa won majority support for
his proposal to transform his well-armed army into local militia.
</P>
<P>
Although his army has been disarmed since Monday, it is still
too early to say for sure of Khun Sa's fate.
</P>
<P>
The US government, eager to bring him to justice, has offered a
2 million dollar reward for information leading to his arrest and
conviction in the US.
</P>
<P>
In 1989, a New York court returned a 10-count indictment
against Khun Sa involving a seizure in Bangkok of 1,080 kilograms
of heroin concealed in bales of rubber.
</P>
<P>
International anti-narcotics agencies reported that Khun Sa has
until now controlled approximately half of the Shan state's annual
output of more than 2,000 kilograms of raw opium.
</P>
<P>
It is now certain that Khun Sa's downfall will help the Myanmar
government in its efforts to reduce opium cultivation and refinery
in the Golden Triangle and constitutes a step forward towards the
goal of national reconciliation.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Drafts Industrial Master Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's industrial sector
will focus on technology and expertise with a regard for
environment conservation and public well-being in future.
</P>
<P>
A national industrial master plan has been drafted by the Board
of National Industries Committee, which is chaired by Deputy Prime
Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, Industry Minister Chaiwat Sinsuwong
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the first one in the country, industrial
activities will expand toward suburban and rural areas, the
minister was quoted by local newspapers as saying today.
</P>
<P>
The Industry Ministry will encourage investors to create small
and medium-sized industries in suburban areas, particularly
agro-based industries, Chaiwat said.
</P>
<P>
Local people will be encouraged to monitor industrial
activities to safeguard the environment, he said.
</P>
<P>
Under Thailand's first industrial master plan, Chaiwat
predicted, per-capita income of Thai people will amount to about
350,000 baht (14,000 US dollars) by the year 2012 from the present
57,000 baht (2,280 dollars).
</P>
<P>
By 2012, Thailand's industrial sector will merely parallel
Japan's industrial sector in 1970, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The draft plan will go to a meeting of representatives from
state agencies and industrial circles scheduled for January 20-21
for approval. The plan, if approved, will begin next year.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scientist Forecasts Return of Comet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The comet Hale-Bopp, whose cycle
of return is 3,000 years, will reach its perigee on April 1, 1997,
a Chinese scientist said.
</P>
<P>
Wang Sichao, an assistant researcher at the Purple Mountain
Observatory under the Chinese Academy of Sciences here, made the
forecast in this capital of east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
The comet was named after its two observers -- two amateur
astronomers in the United States who discovered it on July 22,
1995.
</P>
<P>
When it returns next year its luminosity might surpass that of
Haley's comet when it returned in 1986, according to astronomers.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that, according to the calculations and forecast made
by the Purple Mountain Observatory, Hale-Bopp will keep at a great
distance away from the earth and have no direct influence on it
when it enters the orbit of the earth in March next year. People
in northwest and northeast China will be able to see it with the
naked eye.
</P>
<P>
The observation and studies of the comet will help in the
research into the origins of the earth and its evolution, and
provide important background materials which can be used for
preventing comets and asteroids from colliding with the earth,
Wang said.

<HEADLINE> China to Develop Lysine Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- China's demand for lysine this
year will reach 12,000 to 13,000 tons, much higher than 8,000 tons
which are expected to be provided by the country's two major
lysine producers, according to the "China Chemical Industry News".
</P>
<P>
The Daquan Lysine Co., Ltd in Quanzhou City in southeast China's
Fujian Province and the Lysine Factory in south China's Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region now only have an annual total of 6,000
tons of production capacity.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the country aims to build or expand two or three lysine
factories during the 1996-2000 period to lift the country's annual
lysine production to 20,000 to 30,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The Chuanhua Ajinomoto Company, a joint venture between the
Chuanhua (Group) Company in southwest China's Sichuan Province and
Japan's Ajinomoto Co. Inc., is expected to begin operation in the
first half of this year to produce 6,000 tons of fodder-level
lysine salt per year.
</P>
<P>
The Guangxi Lysine Factory has been using loans from the World
Bank in order to expand the current 3,000 tons of production
capacity per year to nearly 10,000 tons in the coming years.

<P>
CANBERRA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar today
slid lower against all major currencies as the result of the
turmoil international exchange market.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended more than a quarter of US cent
lower at 74.13 US cents, comparing with the 74.51 US cents
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The local currency was pulled down by the weakening US dollar,
which began to slide against the Japanese yen at the news of the
worsening US budget crisis.
</P>
<P>
The resignation of Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama
today ignited fears that Japan's overseas investment might lessen.
 This further weighed down the US dollar in value against the yen.
</P>
<P>
Local dealers said that the Australian dollar tracked the US
dollar-yen cross rate and saw a "pretty wild day." It fluctuated
within a wide range between 73.8 US cents and 74.35 US cents.
</P>
<P>
Local dealers expected the Australian dollar to continue to
fluctuate between 73.70 US cents and 74.30 US cents in the next 24
hours.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar dropped to 77.58 Japanese yen from 77.97

<HEADLINE> Murayama Formally Announces Resignation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Tomiichi
Murayama formally announced his resignation today, putting an end
to his 18-month-old tenure.
</P>
<P>
The announcement came after the Cabinet approved at an
afternoon session the resignation of Murayama, who heads the
Social Democratic Party (SDP) in the tripartite ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
An extra Diet session will be held on January 11 to name
Murayama's successor. Before this date he will act as a caretaking
prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Murayama, 71, told leaders of the other two
parties in the governing bloc, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP)
and New Party Sakigake, that he wanted to step down from his post.
</P>
<P>
The main coalition component LDP is led by Trade Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto, while the smallest component, Sakigake, by
Finance Minister Masayoshi Takemura.
</P>
<P>
Murayama said that the prime minister should be elected from
the largest coalition partner LDP. Murayama's SDP is the second
largest party in the coalition.
</P>
<P>
The three leaders agreed to elect Hashimoto, 58, as successor
to Murayama, and to maintain the current framework of the
three-way ruling coalition, local wire services quoted coalition
officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The fifth son of a fisherman from Oita Prefecture in southern
Japan, Murayama returned to Oita after graduating from Meiji
University in Tokyo. He won a seat on the city council at the age
of 31, then became a prefectural legislator before entering
national politics. His sudden rise to the prime ministership in
June 1994 surprised the whole nation.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Protects Wildlife </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, January 5 (Xinhua) -- "No killing Manchurian tigers
or spotted deer!" warn two billboards erected recently by the
Shenyang City Forestry Bureau in the downtown area of this capital
of northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the province's efforts to protect wild animals,
according to an official with the bureau.
</P>
<P>
The official said that some 20,000 local residents currently
work either full- or part-time to protect wildlife. Thanks to
their efforts, most Liaoning residents have accepted the idea of
protecting wild animals, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Liaoning provincial government has decided to set up 57
no-hunting areas in the habitats or breeding places of rare
species of animals or migrant birds.
</P>
<P>
As a result, some animals have started to reappear in the
forests. Herds of roe deer and packs of wolves are found again in
the Yiwulu Mountains Nature Reserve. Spotted deer and red deer are
also found in the Faku, Jianping and Dalian areas.
</P>
<P>
The Shuangtai Delta Nature Reserve has become a habitat for
red-crown cranes and black-beaked gulls, both of which are species
on the verge of extinction, the official said.
</P>
<P>
"Love Birds Weeks" are held every spring and autumn throughout
Liaoning, he said.
</P>
<P>
During the "Love-Birds Week" in 1994, organized by the Liaoning
Provincial Wildlife Protection Association, six young people
travelled 600 km by bicycle across the province to publicize bird
protection. Some 70,000 artificial nests were set up to encourage
birds to stay.
</P>
<P>
He said that every year various provincial departments inspect
the implementation of the ban on hunting and severely punish
poachers of and dealers in wild animals.
</P>
<P>
On holidays primary and middle school students in Tieling City
help publicize the Law on the Protection of Wildlife and the ban.
</P>
<P>
In November 1994 hundreds of swans flying southward via
Liaoning lost their way because of a heavy fog and were sent by
local people to nearby zoos or forestry stations.

LUSAKA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's ruling Movement for
Multi-Party Democracy (MMD) will hold an extraordinary convention
before the general and presidential elections later this year.
</P>
<P>
MMD National Chairman Sikota Wina said on Thursday that the

</P>
<P>
Wina said five sub-committees were formed at the just ended

Other issues to be tabled include renumeration of party cadres
in districts, mobilization and fund raising campaigns and
coexistence with special interest groups such as the church, the

He admitted that there is need to scale the party administrative
gap created between branches and constituency committees in the

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Foreign Exchange Reserves Decline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's foreign exchange
reserves dropped to 219 million US dollars at the end of last
November from 257 million dollars in October, Bank of Zambia
(BOZ) has revealed.
</P>
<P>
BOZ spokesman Kabinga Pande said on Wednesday that the decline
is temporal which has occurred annually for the past four years.
</P>
<P>
Because the demand for foreign exchange increases greatly at
the end of every year, the Central Bank has to sell more foreign
exchange on the market in order to alleviate excessive pressure
on the exchange rate, Pande explained.
</P>
<P>
Further pressure on the reserves is as a result of the
government's desire to clear debt obligations by the end of every
year so as not to incur any arrears in the new year, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank still has adequate foreign reserves, he
insisted, adding that Zambia will benefit from high prices for
copper and cobalt on the international market to improve its
exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
Copper and its by-product cobalt earn some 90 percent of the
country's foreign exchange reserves.

commissioned yesterday a 14 million US dollar copper mine
expected to earn 7.8 million US dollars in foreign currency
annually.
</P>
<P>
The Sanyati copper mine, 230 kilometers west of Harare,
produced its first copper sheets in November last year by using,
for the first time in Southern Africa, locally produced
sulphureous acid for the leaching process to separate the copper
from the ore.
</P>
<P>
''We are producing top quality copper which is about 99.99
percent pure and at least 40 percent is being sold to three main
local customers,'' the Executive Director of Reunion Mining,
Philip Dewhurst, said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
The Sanyati mine is expected to produce up to 5,000 tonnes of
pure copper annually and process about 4,000 tonnes of run-off
mine daily when fully operational.

<P>
KAMPALA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Uganda National Association
of the Deaf (UNAD) has launched a bi-annual magazine to raise
awareness on the activities and problems of the deaf in the

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Center for
Human Settlements (HABITAT) has been merged with the United
Nations Environment Program to form the United Nations Office
Nairobi (UNON).
</P>
<P>
Sources at the UNEP head quarters said the merger had been
proposed in 1993 by the UN Secretary General and was authorized
today.
</P>
<P>
The UNON, which is the only one UN agency headquartered in a
developing country, is expected to carry out the administrative
functions of the two UN agencies.
</P>
<P>
The merger was the "second" product of the UN internal
restructuring process.
</P>
<P>
The first was the establishment of an Aids program, UNAIDS,
which replaced WHO's global program for Aids.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, the United States had withdrawn its
contributions for the UN Industrial Development Organization
following a realization that only 20 percent of the funds were
spent on programs while 80 percent went to salaries.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, The UN Development Fund also had to cut its
financial assistance to the two former UN agencies in
Nairobi, which finally resulted in the merger.

<HEADLINE> Qinghai Promotes Energy, Raw Materials Sectors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The energy and raw materials
industries have kept growing with a strong momentum in northwest
China's Qinghai Province, statistics indicate.
</P>
<P>
The industries' combined output value comprised 80 percent of
its total industrial output value in 1995, up 39 percent over
1990, according to statistics.
</P>
<P>
From 1991 to 1995 the province attached great importance to the
development of large raw materials enterprises with good economic
result. Meanwhile, investment in power, oil, natural gas,
non-ferrous metals edged up to six billion yuan (723 million US
dollars), 50 percent more than in the previous five-year period.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the province generated 33 billion kwh of
electricity between 1991 and 1995, 3.91 billion more than in the
1990-1995 period. Efforts have been made to develop the abundant
water resources on the upper reaches of the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
In the last five years the province has set up an electrolytic
aluminum plant capable of producing 200,000 tons annually and a
magnesium plant with an annual production capacity of 4,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
With the completion of new oilfields, pipelines and refineries,
the Qinghai Oilfield has entered a period of both exploration and
development. So far, the oilfield has proved to contain more than
200 million tons of oil and 50 billion cu m of gas.
</P>
<P>
The fast-growing raw materials and energy industries have
expanded Qinghai's economic power. In 1995 the province's gross
domestic production topped 16.5 billion yuan-worth, and its
financial revenue reached 1.62 billion yuan, up 132 percent and
109 percent, respectively, over 1990.

<HEADLINE> No Shortage of College Graduates Predicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The number of college students
who will graduate this Summer will basically meet the demand for
college graduates nationwide, according to an official from the
Ministry of Personnel.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, college graduates are facing a challenging
situation in the job market as there are lots of two-year college
students and vocational school students whose jobs are not
assigned to them by the government.
</P>
<P>
A meeting will be held by the Ministry of Personnel
January 6 and 7 to help job-seeking college students meet
employers. More than 3,000 central, local and military departments
are scheduled to attend the meeting and discuss employment with
students.
</P>
<P>
Once an employer and students are satisfied with each other, a
job contract can be signed on the spot, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the State Education Commission (SEC) said last
month that about 866,000 students would graduate from colleges and
universities this year, including 36,000 postgraduates.
</P>
<P>
Since most of these students receive college education at state
expense, the government will still be responsible for assigning
jobs to them.
</P>
<P>
China began to charge students college education fees in
1994. Freshmen in over 30 colleges and universities in 1994 became
the first group of students in China who had to pay part of their
college education cost which used to be paid by the government.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Personnel has urged departments of personnel at
all levels to play an active role in assigning jobs to these
students. The roles of current personnel service organizations
should be played to the full so that college students can be
reasonably distributed to various trades.
</P>
<P>
The SEC announced last month that the demand for college
graduates and postgraduates from departments of agriculture,
irrigation, energy, communications, science and technology,
education and national defense will be given priority.
</P>
<P>
The SEC also plans to hold talks to share information about
college graduates and postgraduates in central China's Wuhan City
this month.
</P>
<P>
A record 895,000 students graduated from colleges an
universities last year. Almost all of them had found jobs before
graduation.

<P>
CANBERRA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Australian stock market
continued to rise today despite the news of worsening monthly
current account deficit in November last year.
</P>
<P>
The all ordinaries index rose 2.3 points to 2,260.7 points.
There were heavy buying from Australian investors during the day,
which helped to support the local bourse at its record high since
February 1994.
</P>
<P>
The local bourse was also boosted by Asian investors who see
good value in local bank shares.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics announced today that the
current account deficit in last November surged to 1.866 billion
Australian dollars (1.381 billion US dollars), much higher than
previous market expectations of 1.65 billion Australian dollars
(1.22 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
But the local bourse ignored the higher-than-expected figure,
because it is believed not to have any immediate impact on
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index rose by nine points to 3,376.3
points, while the all resources index dropped by 3.2 points to
1,418.7 points.

<HEADLINE> South Africa Urged To Rectify Trade Imbalance  With SADC </HEADLINE>

HARARE, January 5 (Xinhua) -- South Africa should put in order
its bilateral and multilateral agreements within the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) before it could be accorded
entry into the ACP-EU group of states, the Zimbabwe National
Chamber of Commerce (ZNCC) said.
</P>
<P>
The ZNCC said in its latest newsletter that current trade
favored South Africa's manufacturers and as such, South Africa
wanted to maintain the status quo.
</P>
<P>
South Africa exported about three times as much to the rest of
southern Africa as it imported, said the ZNCC.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe and other countries should also start lobbying for
the ratification of a SADC trade protocol when it was tabled at
the SADC heads of state and government summit in August this year
and the ACP-EU for South Africa's conditional entry into the Lome
convention, said the ZNCC.
</P>
<P>
Preferential trade agreement talks between Zimbabwe and South
Africa have been stalled since 1992 when Pretoria slapped
punitive tariffs of about 90 percent on Zimbabwean textiles and
clothing.

<HEADLINE> "No Tuition Fee Charge Ahead of Academic Year" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Colleges and universities are
not allowed to charge tuition fees ahead of the beginning of the
academic year, the State Planning Commission (SPC) stressed here
today.
</P>
<P>
An SPC official said that tuition fees can only be charged once
in an academic year, according to documents jointly issued by the
State Education Commission and the Ministry of Finance.
</P>
<P>
However, last autumn, as a new academic year started, some
colleges and universities charged students tuition fees for all
the years that they were expected to stay in college.
</P>
<P>
"This abuse has caused strong dissatisfaction among students
and their parents," said the official.
</P>
<P>
The wrongdoing was found out when the SPC conducted an
examination of tuition fee charges among colleges and universities
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Several colleges and universities in northeast China's Liaoning
Province were found to have charged tuition fees covering four
years when the students were still freshmen.
</P>
<P>
The Education Committee and other departments of Liaoning
Province have told these colleges and universities to return to
the students the extra fees.
</P>
<P>
The SPC official warned other colleges, universities or regions
which have indulged in similar practices to correct them at once.

<HEADLINE> Commerce Department Turned into Conglomerate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The previous Guangdong
provincial commercial department has been successfully turned into
an economic conglomerate in the process of streamlining the
government.
</P>
<P>
Within the old government framework, the commerce department
was responsible for administrating State-run commerce. In a drive
to streamline the government, Guangdong Province as a pioneer of
economic reform, decided in 1992 to turn its commerce department
into an economic entity while shifting its government function to
the provincial financial and trade office.
</P>
<P>
After three years of efforts the Guangdong Commerce Enterprise
Group has already developed into a real enterprise conglomerate
with diversified businesses, including commerce, manufacturing,
auctions, property, futures brokerage, pawnshops, storage and
foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
One of the successful businesses under the group is the
Guangdong Provincial Auction Company, the transactions of which
have reached one billion yuan (about 120.48 million US
dollars)-worth over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
Another success story is a property company owned by the group,
which generated 18 million yuan in profits in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The whole group, which runs more than 220 enterprises, became
profit-making in 1993, the first year of its operation.

<HEADLINE> Labor Law Under Steady Implementation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Labor Law, which went into
effect January 1 last year, has helped protect the rights and
interests of both businesses and their employees, the "People's
Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
The labor contract system, featuring a two-way selection
mechanism between enterprises and employees, has been carried out
across the country, involving 80 percent of enterprises and
individuals.
</P>
<P>
As part of the contract system, the Ministry of Labor has
experimented with a collective contract system in some cities. Up
to now, collective contracting agreements have been signed in 13
businesses under the municipal jurisdiction of Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Local governments have worked out salary bottom lines in
accordance with their different conditions. The standard in
Guangzhou and Zhongshan cities in Guangdong Province is fixed at
320 yuan a month, that in Shenzhen and Zhuhai cities in the
province is 380 yuan and that in Beijing is 240 yuan.
</P>
<P>
To ensure the sound implementation of the law, local labor
departments have set up supervision organizations to curb unlawful
activities, and protect the rights and interests of workers and
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Labor arbitration commissions at various levels helped settle
labor disputes. Statistics show that during the first three
quarters of the year, the commissions handled 19,161 disputes,
88.9 percent of which were settled satisfactorily.
</P>
<P>
With regard to working hours, most enterprises have implemented
the five-day work week, beginning May 1 last year, and a number of
others are making preparations for carrying out the system.
</P>
<P>
While making more progress on the basis of such achievements,
the Ministry of Labor will step up reform of insurance items
covering pensions, employment and medical care.

<HEADLINE> Gunman Surrenders After Wounding Two in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- A gunman who opened fire in
an office building in northwestern U.S. surrendered to police this
evening after wounding two people and taking four others as
hostages, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The gunman, armed with an assault rifle, entered the 30-story
Koin Tower in Portland, Oregon, at about 2 p.m. local time. He
opened fire near the loading area of the underground garage and
then holed up in a brokerage office with four hostages.
</P>
<P>
The gunman released the hostages before giving himself up to
police, having hidden in an office of the Charles Schwab brokerage
for four hours.
</P>
<P>
Police believed the gunman had been fired from his job as a
deliveryman having problems with some female employees of a
company in the office tower, the Associated Press said.
</P>
<P>
"He was angry at these women and decided he was going to go
there and shoot them," the wire service quoted police Lt. C.W.
Jensen as saying.
</P>
<P>
A witness said the gunman, dressed in camouflage fatigues, was
a white male in his 30s. One of his victims was shot twice in the
back, the other was shot three or four times in the leg.
</P>
<P>
The gunman began ordering people into the office after the
building's alarms went off and the elevators were shut down.
Hostage negotiators believed the gunman still had at least three
women hostages.
</P>
<P>
The man who was shot in the back was identified as Alan
Kolkemo, 24, and the man wounded in the leg, Howard Barley,
45. Both were in fair condition at a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the shooting, police cordoned off streets around the
downtown tower, which houses several major law firms, a six-screen
movie theater and 11 floors of condominium units.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Australia's building approvals
increased in November last year, but the trend indicated that the
building industry remains flat in the 1995- 96 financial year.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported today that the
number of new houses approved in November reached 10,386 units in
seasonally adjusted terms.
</P>
<P>
This was up by 3.5 percent as compared with that of the
previous month, when the figure stood at 10,035 units.
</P>
<P>
In October, the country's building approvals declined 8
percent.
</P>
<P>
In trend terms, the number of dwelling units approved dropped
1.7 percent in November, following a decline of 2.1 percent in the
previous month.
</P>
<P>
Today's figure "supports the expectation that the most severe
falls in housing industry activity have past and the decline in
housing industry activity is now slowing," Minister for Housing
Brian Howe said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Australia's building industry, experiencing a strong growth
over the past years, has been in the doldrums following the
tightening of the monetary policy in the second half of 1994.
</P>
<P>
The building industry is expected to continue falling during
the current fiscal year before beginning to pick up in the 1996-97
fiscal year.

<HEADLINE> China Gives Top Priority to Spreading New Farming Techniques </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Governments at all levels
have given top priority to the spreading of advanced farming
techniques in coastal Zhejiang Province in east China.
</P>
<P>
At present, a network has taken shape in Zhejiang to spread
scientific knowledge and applied farming techniques in the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, the provincial authorities have
targeted the rural areas among their efforts to implement the
strategy of "rejuvenating the province by relying on science and
technology".
</P>
<P>
Various programs, including the "Spark Program", "Bumper
Harvest Program", and "High-Yield Farmland Project", have been
carried out in a bid to spread advanced techniques in the
countryside.
</P>
<P>
A network to spread the techniques, consisting mainly of
scientific associations, youth leagues and women's federations as
well as government departments, has taken shape.
</P>
<P>
Training classes for farmer Communist Party members and
grassroots cadres are being held across the province. At present,
350,000 of the province's over 400,000 Communist Party members
aged below 50 among the farmers have received such training. Some
70 percent of the trainees have mastered at least one applied
technique.
</P>
<P>
Farmers' schools are also playing an important role in
disseminating new techniques. The Zhejiang Farming Correspondence
University now has 84 city- and county-level branches and 939
training stations, and its annual enrolment has increased from
some 10,000 to 40,000. So far, it has had 100,000 graduates, who
have grasped one or two applied techniques. Half of the graduates
have become agro-technicians.
</P>
<P>
Various specialized associations have become important channels
to spread the use of new techniques. There are now more than 3,000
such associations, covering the cultivation of aquatic products,
silkworms, tea, oranges, vegetables, edible fungus and tomatoes,
and the raising of bees, rabbits and ducks. They have set up
connections with one million households.
</P>
<P>
To stimulate the spread of new techniques, local authorities
attach importance to setting up pilot households. At present,
there are some 122,800 such households in the province, whose
success stories have had a great influence on their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
The network has paid off. So far, the coverage rate of quality
breeds has surpassed 90 percent. The township enterprises account
for three-fourths of the province's total industrial output value,
and the province's farmers' per capita income leads the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
China generated industrial added value of more than 2,300
billion yuan in 1995, an increase of 14 percent over the previous
year, the SSB spokesman said. The growth rate in 1995 was four
percentage points less than in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The light industry growth rate was up by 16 percent, four
percentage points more than that of heavy industry, which was
affected by the reduction of investment in fixed assets.
</P>
<P>
The growth speed of state-owned industry increased somewhat
last year, narrowing the gap in the growth of the different
industrial sectors as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The production of most light and textile goods, energy,
chemicals and farm-use goods registered a relatively bigger
increase whereas that of machinery and metallurgical industry
products increased at a slow pace.
</P>
<P>
China harvested more than 460 million tons of food grains in
1995, setting a record, Ye said.
</P>
<P>
China's booming consumer market has become one of the major
forces driving the nation's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Ye said retail sales of consumer goods surpassed 2,000 billion
yuan-worth in 1995, an increase of about 10 percent in real terms.
</P>
<P>
The supply of industrial products slightly exceeded the demand,
with 94 percent of commodities being effectively supplied.
</P>
<P>
The supply of farm produce improved markedly last year, and the
market for capital goods witnessed a steady growth, Ye said.
</P>
<P>
China registered a surplus of nearly 20 billion US dollars in
foreign trade last year, the SSB spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The total volume of imports and exports reached about 280
billion US dollars-worth in 1995, 18 percent up from the previous
year, Ye said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, foreign investment in China rose 11 percent to hit
37 billion US dollars last year, Ye said.
</P>
<P>
The state's foreign exchange reserve was also expected to reach
some 70 billion US dollars at the end of 1995.
</P>
<P>
China witnessed a slight increase in its urban unemployment
rate in 1995, which stood at 2.9 percent by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Ye noted that nearly half of the workers laid off last year
have been re-employed, thanks to joint efforts by governments at
various levels and enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The 2.9 percent unemployment rate compares to 2.8 percent in
1994.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Ye added, the average per-capita income,
adjusted for inflation, is expected to rise by some four percent
to 3,855 yuan for urban residents and five percent to 1,550 yuan
for rural residents.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, some residents have seen their real incomes
falling and have difficulty making ends meet, Ye said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- China's economy expanded by 10.2
percent last year, Ye Zhen, spokesman for the State Statistics
Bureau, announced here today.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference that China's Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) reached 5.77 trillion yuan in 1995, fulfilling five years
ahead of schedule the country's plan to quadruple the 1980 GDP by
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth rate in 1995 was 10.2 percent, a drop of
1.6 percentage points from 11.8 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The country attained an added value of more than 1,100 billion
yuan from agriculture last year, representing a 4.5 percent rise
over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The output of cotton, edible oil, sugar, meat, vegetables and
aquatic products also increased to varying degrees.
</P>
<P>
The bumper agricultural harvest has helped to ease the burden
on farm products and stabilize market prices, Ye said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, inflation slowed down as a result of the
government's macro-economic control, with the retail price index
dropping to 1995's 14.8 percent from 21.7 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
China spent 1,900 billion yuan on fixed assets in 1995, an
increase of 19 percent over the previous year, the SSB spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
However, the growth rate dropped by 12 percentage points in
comparison with the 1994 figure.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, the investment by state organizations
in agriculture in the first 11 months of 1995 went up by 35.6
percent over the same period in 1994, and investment in the
service trades rose 21.9 percent. Included is investment in
transport and telecommunications -- up by 24.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The investment structure varies from area to area, and central
China invested the most in fixed assets last year.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Demands Japan Remain "Enemy State" in U.N. Charter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea demanded today that Japan continue to be called
an enemy state in the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of the DPRK's ruling
party, said in a commentary that Japan was different from Germany
and Italy which had both agonized over their roles in World War II.
</P>
<P>
It said that Germany had admitted war crimes committed by the
Nazis and compensated for them.
</P>
<P>
But Japan had neither admitted nor atoned for the calamities
that Japanese invaders had inflicted on the people of Asia, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
The article argued that to remove the label of enemy state from
Japan without its full admission of its war guilt would only help
Japan to gloss over its war crimes and encourage the aggressive
ambitions of some Japanese.
</P>
<P>
A DPRK delegation to the U.N. General Assembly's 50th session
last year suggested that the U.N. Charter be revised so as to
apply the enemy state clause to Japan until it sincerely
acknowledges its war crimes.
</P>
<P>
The Rodong Sinmun article said that to remove the label under
current circumstances would run counter to the principle of the
U.N. Charter which aspires for worldwide peace and security.
</P>
<P>
If the Japanese want to have the label removed, the article
added, they should start pondering over their war crimes in
earnest and pay war reparations.

<HEADLINE> Demand for Farm Machinery Rising in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The total output value of the
farm machinery industry in China this year is expected to rise
some 10 percent over the 1995 figure to hit 71 billion yuan, the
"China Chemical Industry News" reported.
</P>
<P>
This is attributed to the fact that China will build 226
commodity grain base counties, 150 high-quality cotton counties,
and a large group of sugar production bases during the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
Construction of water-control works, harnessing of rivers and
lakes, and popularization of technological advances will call for
high demand for machinery.
</P>
<P>
Loans given to agriculture by the state are increased every
year, which helps speed up the development of markets for
machinery.
</P>
<P>
In order to compete with foreign countries in this field, many
manufacturers will place emphasis on exports.
</P>
<P>
With the growth of township enterprises and development of
diversified agricultural economy, China's demand for agricultural
machinery will boom.
</P>
<P>
Of farm machinery, the most favored will be the middle and
small-sized items.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- China's consumer price index is
estimated to have grown 17 percent last year, said Ye Zhen,
spokesman for the State Statistics Bureau today.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate was more than seven percentage points down from
that for 1994.
</P>
<P>
According to preliminary estimates, China's retail price index
grew 14.8 percent in 1995, compared with 21.7 percent for the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
Ye said at a press conference that the achievement in curbing
inflation within the 15 percent government target is attributed to
the central government's tight monetary policy, increased supply
of commodities, and strengthened supervision and management over
the markets.
</P>
<P>
He said that Shaanxi and Yunnan provinces and the Tibet
Autonomous Region have the highest retail price growth rates, all
growing at around 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin Municipality and Hainan and Guangdong provinces have
the lowest growth rates in their retail price indices. They grew
respectively 11 percent, 11.5 percent and 12 percent.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that China is still confronted with a
gigantic task of inflation control because the growth rates in
prices are still relatively high, the agricultural sector is still
weak and many enterprises have difficulties in production and
management.

goals by Canada.
</P>
<P>
The Canadians equaled the mark set by the Soviet Union, which
won four straight titles from 1977-80.
</P>
<P>
Hnat Domenichelli, the Hartford Whalers' second-round pick in
the 1994 National Hockey League draft, scored 72 seconds after
Langkow to extend the lead to 3-1 and Alyn McCauley closed the
scoring midway through the third. McCauley was the New Jersey
Devils' fifth pick in last June's draft.
</P>
<P>
Jarome Iginla set up Canada's first three goals and was named
the tournament's top forward.
</P>
<P>
Jose Theodore made 30 saves for Canada and was named the
tournament's top goaltender.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, Ruslan Shafikov had a goal and an assist as
Russia beat the Czech Republic 4-1 to win the bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
In the play-off for the fifth place, the United States rallied
to beat Finland 8-7 in overtime.

<HEADLINE> Australian Retail Trade Rises in November 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Australia's retail trade rose
1.2 percent in November 1995 over the previous month, the
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) announced today.
</P>
<P>
Retail trade went up to 10.01 billion Australian dollars (7.4
billion US dollars) in November 1995 from 9.89 billion Australian
dollars (7.3 billion US dollars) in October on a seasonally
adjusted basis, said the ABS.
</P>
<P>
But in trend terms, retail trade increased only 0.3 percent in
November over the previous month, despite the then approaching
Christmas season.
</P>
<P>
The exceptionally flat figures followed continuing ease of
retail trade growth in trend terms in the previous five months.
</P>
<P>
This indicated that Australia's domestic demand is growing at a
slowing pace as the economy heads to a soft landing.
</P>
<P>
Earlier polls by the ABS revealed that most of the big
companies in Australia expected their sales and profits to drop in
the first half of 1996.

<P>
DHAKA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The three mainstream opposition
parties in Bangladesh held a liaison committee meeting last night,
urging Prime Minister Begum Khaleda Zia to immediately have a
neutral caretaker government set up for the upcoming national
elections.
</P>
<P>
The Awami (People's) League, the Jatiya (National) Party and
the Jamaat-E-Islami warned that the prime minister and the
government of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) would be held
responsible if the situation deteriorated further and plunged the
nation into conflict and confrontation.
</P>
<P>
The opposition would not take part in any election without a
non-party caretaker government and would resist "farcical" polls
at any cost, the opposition said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that the BNP was seeking the participation
in the upcoming elections of the Jamaat-E-Islami if the other two
opposition parties continued to boycott the process of the polls.

<HEADLINE> Train Ticket Prices to Remain Stable During Lunar New Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The prices of train tickets
will maintain their present level despite an expected big rise in
the number of passengers during the traditional Spring Festival,
China's lunar New Year, the Ministry of Railways announced here
today.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Minister of Railways Guo Lin said that students and
members of the People's Liberation Army will enjoy 50-percent
discounts.
</P>
<P>
People from Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan who are attending
schools on the mainland will be allowed to buy tickets at half
price for the first time ever.
</P>
<P>
The country's trains will carry 143 million passengers in the
50 days between January 30 and March 19, some 2.03 million people,
or 1.3 percent, more than in the same period of last year, Guo
said, predicting that the maximum daily passenger traffic will be
3.5 million.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister attributed most of the growth in the number
of railway passengers to the vast number of migrant workers who
will return home for family reunions and the longer holiday period
for this year.
</P>
<P>
There are now 1,088 pairs of train running on the national
railway network every day. Another 42 pairs of express trains are

<HEADLINE> Sri Lankan Opposition Accuses Governors of  Violating Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan opposition leader
Ranil Wickremesinghe has accused the governors of the
North-Central and Sabaragamuwa provinces violating the
constitution by dissolving the two provincial councils on
Presidential directives.
</P>
<P>
The chief ministers of the two provincial councils who had
received the letters from the respective governors seeking their
opinion on the dissolution of the councils, were opposed to the
decision, Ranil told the local press Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two chief ministers had responded in writing, refuting the
charges leveled against them and also pointing out that there were
insufficient grounds for dissolving the councils, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the constitution, the governors shall dissolve the
council with advice of the chief ministers as long as the board of
ministers demands, Ranil said.
</P>
<P>
He said the President is also not empowered to direct governors
to dissolve provincial councils.
</P>
<P>
The United National Party (UNP) intended to agitate against
this arbitrary decision in every fora and will challenge it in
court, he added.
</P>
<P>
The two provincial councils were controlled by the main
opposition UNP.
</P>
<P>
These councils were set up in 1985 as a step towards resolving
the ethnic crisis through devolution of power. The latest election
for them was held in 1994 for a term of five years.

ZAGREB, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of Croatia and the
Bosnian Muslim-Croat Federation met today in Sarajevo for the
inaugural session of their joint council for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian delegation was led by President Franjo Tudjman
and the Bosnian delegation by President Alija Izetbegovic.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after more than three hours of talks,
the two presidents described the meeting as very successful.
</P>
<P>
"Substantial steps forward have been made," Tudjman said,
adding that there were still "problems to be solved" on the issue
of the federation.
</P>
<P>
Izetbegovic said that they had reached agreement on exempting
Bosnian citizens traveling to Croatia from visa requirements.
This would apply for the time being only to Federation citizens.
Citizens of the Bosnian Serb entity would be granted via exemption
after the completion of elections.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also decided to grant an amnesty to those who had
been involved in the fighting between Bosnian Croats and Muslims
except for individuals indicted for war crimes under international
law.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed in Washington in March, 1994, the
Bosnian Croats and Muslims formed an alliance against the Serbs.
Despite successful military cooperation, the federation is behind

<HEADLINE> France Plans to Increase Wind Energy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 5 (Xinhua) -- France plans to increase its wind
energy production from the current 3.4 megawatts to 250 to 500
megawatts by the year 2005, said an official of the French
Ministry of Industry.
</P>
<P>
France, which is advanced in using nuclear energy, lags behind
the United States, Germany, Denmark and other countries in
developing wind-driven energy, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The United States produces annually 1,717 megawatts in wind
power, accounting for half of the world's production. Germany's
wind energy production stands at 630 megawatts per year, with
Denmark at 530 megawatts and Spain at 75 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
According to French experts, the production cost of wind energy
is less than nuclear energy because a nuclear power station has a
lifetime of only 30 years.
</P>
<P>
They estimated that by the year 2030 the world's wind energy
production will reach 100,000 megawatts, equivalent to the energy
output of 111 Daya Bay nuclear power plants in China's southern
Guangdong Province.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 4 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette said today that Europe will remain the priority for
French diplomacy in the year 1996.
</P>
<P>
With the initiation of the European Union's structural reform,
the debate over the European Monetary Union and the southward and
eastward enlargement of the EU, the year 1996 will be crucial for
Europe, the minister told the press.
</P>
<P>
He said Europe is where France exercises "most directly our
capacity of influence and our aptitude to change the course of
affairs."
</P>
<P>
Europe is also the place where France conducts most of its
economic, cultural and human exchanges and therefore is the "core
of our action and diplomacy," he added.
</P>
<P>
Besides Europe, France hopes it will establish a "solid and
durable relation" with the United States and engage itself with
the U.S. in the renovation of NATO.
</P>
<P>
He vowed that France is determined to play a due role in the
renewal of the Atlantic alliance.
</P>
<P>
The minister also expressed hope that France will expand its
influence in the Mediterranean nations and, in particular, in the
new phase of the peace process in the Near East.
</P>
<P>
De Charette said French foreign policy in the year also eyes
Asia, which he describes as the new frontier of French diplomacy.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 4 (Xinhua) -- France is to issue treasury bonds
worth 520 billion French francs (about 105.5 billion U.S. dollars)
in 1996, 17 billion francs (3.5 billion dollars) more than last
year, the French Economy and Finance Ministry announced today.
</P>
<P>
The new bonds will be used to plug this year's budget deficit,
which totals 290 billion francs (58.8 billion dollars), and to
cover last year's shortfalls.
</P>
<P>
This year's treasury bonds comprise 270 billion francs (54.8
billion dollars) in long-term bonds and 250 billion francs (50.7
billion dollars) in medium-term bonds.
</P>
<P>
French economists and some research institutes expect
additional bonds to be issued if the revenue falls and the deficit
increases, which could happen with lower economic growth. The
present budget is based on a projected growth rate of 2.8 percent
for this year.
</P>
<P>
Speculation by economists that more bonds may be issued has
been fueled by the government's pledge not to impose additional
taxes this year.

biggest buyers, followed by the Chinese mainland, South Korea and

<HEADLINE> Azerbaijani President Meets British Foreign Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Azerbaijani President Geidar
Aliyev met British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind in Baku today
to discuss settlement of the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute and joint
exploration of offshore oil in the Caspian Sea.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind later met his Azerbaijani counterpart Gasan Gasanov and
signed an agreement on mutual protection and promotion of
investment, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was hailed as instrumental to attracting more
British capitals to Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
Local reports quoted Rifkind as saying at a post-meeting press
conference that settlement of the dispute can be achieved this
year if the conflicting sides show "a true political will."
</P>
<P>
Rifkind promised Gasanov an all-out assistance in accelerating
the peace process in the Nagorno-Karabakh region within the
framework of the guidelines of the U.N. and the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Hostilities broke out between Azerbaijanis and Armenians early
in 1988 over the status of Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian-populated
enclave in the boundaries of Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
Armed conflicts have since resulted in thousands of deaths and
injuries as well as 1 million refugees.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind arrived from the Armenian capital of Yerevan, where he
met Armenian President Levon Ter-Petrosyan for talks on the
solution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind is scheduled to leave Baku later Thursday for Tashkent,
Uzbekistan.

<HEADLINE> Lithuanian President Tries to Calm Down Banking Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Lithuanian President Algirdas
Brazauskas today called on the nation to solve the banking crisis
in the interest of the country and avoid any hasty action.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference, Brazauskas criticized Prime Minister
Adolfas Slezevicius for secretly drawing his personal deposit from
a bank before the crisis occurred.
</P>
<P>
However, he said he would not mount a motion of non-confidence
in the government or the prime minister because "they were busy
with their heavy work."
</P>
<P>
On December 20, 1995, the National Bank suspended the operation
of Lithuania's two biggest commercial banks because of financial
irregularities, leading to an ensuing banking crisis that shocked
the whole country.
</P>
<P>
Prime Slezevicius was under fire for abusing his power to
withdrew his 130,500 lit (about 34,000 U.S. dollars) of personal
deposit from one of the crisis-hit banks two days before the banks
were closed down.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties accused Slezevicius of taking advantage of
his job to seek personal gains and demanded his immediate
resignation.
</P>
<P>
Brazauskas said that Slezevicius' move was "undoubtedly"
immoral, but that Slezevicius's resignation would not make things
any better since there are only nine months to go before new
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
He said the government should now focus its attention on how to
help concerned organizations and individuals to recover their
money frozen in the two banks.

BANGKOK, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Senior Bangkok police officers
have been warned that they will face tough action if they fail to
ensure night spots in their areas close by 2 A.M.
</P>
<P>
The most serious penalty senior police officers in urban
Bangkok will face is transfer to other areas, according to
Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sophon Warachanont.
</P>
<P>
In recent months Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-archa has
expressed concern over increasing cases of entertainment venues,
like night clubs, discos and bars, breaking the law.
</P>
<P>
He ordered strict enforcement of law.
</P>
<P>
If entertainment venues fail to close by 2 A.M., arrests will
be made, according to Bangkok police sources.
</P>
<P>
Police will also target gambling dens.
</P>
<P>
If any police officer is found turning a blind eye or receiving
bribes he will be transferred either to an inactive post or to
another area.

<HEADLINE> House Republicans Fail to Agree on Plan to End Shutdown </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. House Republican leaders
failed to advance a plan to end the 20-day-old partial federal
government shutdown Thursday night during a meeting of the House
Republican Conference.
</P>
<P>
"There is no resolution," Representative John Boehner, a member
of the House Republican leadership, told reporters at the end of a
roughly two-hour party caucus.
</P>
<P>
The plan, which Republican sources said would immediately
return all 280,000 furloughed federal employees, got only mixed
reviews at the closed-door meeting in a House office caucus room.
</P>
<P>
There were "a lot of options put on the table" and Republican
leaders would take "a couple of more days" to decide what to do,
Boehner said.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for House Speaker Newt Gingrich said the House
leadership would refine the measure and bring it back to the
conference on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The plan pushed by Republican leaders would also restore full
pay to another 480,000 workers, who have been working without
salary since the second partial shutdown began on December 16.
</P>
<P>
The plan, which would cover the workers until March 15, would
provide money for a few of the programs in the nine Cabinet
departments and dozens of other agencies whose spending bills have
not been completed.
</P>
<P>
Funds would also be granted to reopen national parks and
museums and to reinstate public charity programs, like the Meals
on Wheels program that provides dinners for thousands of needy
senior citizens. There would be no funds, however, for many
Commerce Department programs favored by President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Republican leaders called off Earlier today a meeting with the
White House on balancing the budget. However, Senate Majority
Leader Republican Bob Dole said he expected further sessions on
Friday and Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Poland to Provide Most, Cheapest Labor for Europe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Poland has the most affluent and
cheapest labor force in Europe, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the U.N. prediction, Europe will have 3.7 million
more new labor force between 1996 and 2001, to which Poland will
add 950,000.
</P>
<P>
Poland, with a steadily increasing population of 38.624 million
in 1995, will be a major partner of the European Union where the
labor resource is dwindling.
</P>
<P>
The Polish Statistics Bureau said that the country's labor cost
was the lowest in Europe last year.
</P>
<P>
In Poland, each labor is paid two ECUs (European Currency Unit)
per hour, compared with the 23 ECUs in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Cheap labor has attracted many foreign investors to the Eastern
European nation.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Sectors Welcome Talks With Armed Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Political groups and the
Colombian Church have welcomed the government's stated intention
to hold talks with paramilitary groups with the ultimate aim of
demobilising them.
</P>
<P>
Their reaction followed the announcement made Tuesday by
Interior Minister Horacio Serpa Uribe that the government was
prepared to begin a dialogue with so-called Self-Defense Groups
which have been combating guerrilla organizations for several
years in the northeast of the country.
</P>
<P>
The government hopes to demobilize the groups, numbering about
700 men, which operate in the rural areas of Uraba and Cordoba in
Antioquia Department, and part of the Magdalena Medio.
</P>
<P>
To date, Serpa said, the venue and procedures for the dialogue
have not been agreed.
</P>
<P>
Cordoba Province Bishop Julio Cesar Vidal, whose bishopric
covers areas where the paramilitary groups operate, said Serpa's
initiative was "an event that pleases us," adding that "dialogue
will be the solution to a conflict that has caused only
destruction."
</P>
<P>
But church representatives said that the participation of the
guerrilla groups was also necessary to facilitate dialogue and
demobilization.
</P>
<P>
Mayors of the townships located in the area also welcomed the
government's determination to negotiate with the paramilitary
groups.
</P>
<P>
The government's initiative and the willingness of the
paramilitary groups to return to normal life "deserve all the
support of the Colombian people," said local authorities.

<HEADLINE> Gunman Wounds Two, Takes Hostages in U.S. Office Building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- A gunman opened fire in an
office building in northwestern state of Oregon, injuring two men
in a underground garage and taking at least four hostage,
authorities said today.
</P>
<P>
The gunman, armed with an assault rifle, entered a 30-story
Koin Tower in Portland, Oregon, at about 14:00 local time, opened
fire near the loading area of the underground garage, injuring
two, and then rounded up four in a brokerage office as hostage.
</P>
<P>
One of his victims was shot twice in the back, the other was
shot three or four times in the leg.
</P>
<P>
The man shot in the back, identified as Alan Kolkemo, 24, was
listed in serious condition in hospital. The man wounded in the
leg, identified as Howard Barley, 45, was less injured.
</P>
<P>
He released one of the hostages about two hours later. At
least three women were believed still at his hands.
</P>
<P>
Police said they were under fire from the gunman when they
arrived at the building.
</P>
<P>
They cordoned off streets around the downtown tower, which
housed several major law firms, a six-screen movie theater and 11
floors of condominium units.
</P>
<P>
The shooter has already been cornered, the police said.
</P>
<P>
"He can't go anywhere," an Associated Press report quoted
police Lieutenant C.W. Jensen as saying. "We've got everything
secured right now. We've got (police) officers all over the
building."
</P>
<P>
The gunman, wearing camouflage fatigues, was described by a
witness as a white male in his 30s.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Wants to Defer Payment of U.S. Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Mexico is negotiating with
the U.S. Department of Treasury over the extension of the deadline
for the repayment of 1.3 billion U.S. dollars, part of the
20-billion-dollar aid package from the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Alejandro Valenzuela, spokesman for Economic Recovery Alliance
(APRE), was quoted by Mexican press as saying today that the 1.3
billion dollar payment is the obligation that the Mexican Central
Bank has with the U.S. Treasury due this year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government offered Mexico in February last year a
20-billion-dollar financial assistance package, of which Mexico
has only used 12.5 billion dollars to remedy its battered economy.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached between the two countries, Mexico
will have to pay off 11.5 billion dollars between 1996 and 2000,
and talks on longer repayment terms are possible.
</P>
<P>
The APRE, composed of the leaders of the country's productive
and financial sectors, joins the federal government in formulating
the economic and financial policies to end the Mexican monetary
crisis.

<P>
DHAKA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Diplomatic maneuvering is
continuing to bring Bangladesh's embroiled ruling and opposition
parties across the table to break the current political stalemate
over the modalities of a neutral caretaker government to supervise
the upcoming general elections.
</P>
<P>
According to reliable sources here today, US Ambassador David
N. Merrill Thursday had contacts with negotiators from both sides.
</P>
<P>
Although there was no contact between the government and the
opposition, diplomats were active to resume informal talks between
the two sides shortly, the sources confirmed.
</P>
<P>
Commerce and Information Minister Shamsul Islam and Presidium
Member of the Awami (people's) League, the largest opposition
party in the country, Amir Hossain Amu are negotiating on behalf
of the government and the opposition camps.
</P>
<P>
But the negotiators fell apart Tuesday on the question of
structure and power of an advisory council to be headed by the
President.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) alleged that the
opposition set two preconditions for further discussions, which
include the appointment of an interim prime minister or chief
advisor with executive powers to head a neutral non-party
government and the postponement of the earlier announced February
7 election until after Ramadan.
</P>
<P>
The opposition side denied the allegation, saying that the
points had already been discussed during their meetings with BNP
leaders.

<HEADLINE> Hebei Suffering From Water Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- An inadequate water supply is
seriously hindering economic growth and the raising of living
standards in north China's Hebei Province, according to today's
China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the problem is prevalent in the province's
western plain, where its major industrial cities are located, and
from where more than half of the province's grain output is
typically derived.
</P>
<P>
Local officials urged State authorities to build as soon as
possible the long-awaited channel will divert Yangtze River water
to thirsty North China.
</P>
<P>
Of the routs proposed for the diversion, it is thought that the
middle route would benefit one third of the farmland and three
fifths of the industrial zones in the western plain, supplying
some 3.8 billion cubic meters of water each year.
</P>
<P>
A survey shows that the gap between need and water resources
will average at least 4.5 billion cubic meters annually.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, the survey concluded, available water will
fall short of the need by from 6.8 billion to 11.2 billion cubic
meters.
</P>
<P>
Two critical issues remain unresolved since the 1970s, and they
are only getting more pressing with time.
</P>
<P>
One is the threat to sustainable development in four of the
province's most important industrial cities -- Handan, Xingtai,
Baoding and Shijiazhuang.
</P>
<P>
For example, in Handan city, an underground funnel caused by
overuse of groundwater now affects over 80 sq km in the urban
districts; so far it has caused some 30 ground fissures.
</P>
<P>
Even worse, the problem has caused a depression of the earth
0.8 meters deep in one of the city's major industrial zones,
threatening the safety of buildings there.
</P>
<P>
The other long-term problem is the appropriate allocation of
limited water resources between agricultural and industrial uses.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the province's ecology and social environment are
deteriorating, with many of the local water courses being
suspended and river water getting increasingly undrinkable.
</P>
<P>
Some eight million residents in the Cangzhou and Hengshui
prefectures are already drinking water with a high fluorine
content.

<HEADLINE> China Pledges to Tap More Mineral Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua)-- China aims to discover more
mineral resources in the coming five years to meet the growing
demand of the nation's economic development, "China Daily"
reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Zhang Hongtao, deputy director of the
Geological Survey Bureau under the Ministry of Geology and Mineral
Resources (MGMR), as saying that top priorities will be oil, gas,
gold, jade and diamond reserves.
</P>
<P>
He said his ministry will focus on exploration of reserves in
the country's western and central regions.
</P>
<P>
As for the eastern region, Zhang was quoted as saying that the
task is to try to discover limited potential deposits since the
overall mineral resource survey in this area has been completed.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang, the MGMR plans to find two to three large
national mineral resource bases which could be used within five
years' time, but no further details were given.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the MGMR will make a 1:250,000 national geological
map during the period to replace the old 1:200,000 one, a move
Zhang described as in keeping with the international standards. At
present, the 1:200,000 scale is in a stage of being phased out in
the world.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Wang Baoliang, a senior MGMR geologist, was quoted
saying that his ministry discovered more than 500 mineral deposits
during the past five years, most of which are urgently needed for
the country's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
During the past five years, the MGMR discovered almost 100
million tons of gas and oil reserves, most in hinterland areas
such as Tibet and Xinjiang Uygur autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
The MGMR also reportedly helped to find some high-production
gas and oil fields in the East China Sea, with newly discovered
oil reserves in the area amounting to 3.33 million tons and gas
reserves to 18.7 billion cubic metres.

<TEXT>
<P>
BOGOTA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian Attorney-General's
Office today began investigating an American Airlines plane crash
to determine responsibility for the accident that killed 160
people.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing flight 757 crashed into the San Jose mountain, near
Buga in southwest Colombia, on December 20.
</P>
<P>
The investigation will decide whether Colombia's Civil
Aeronautic Department had any responsibility for the accident.
</P>
<P>
Two veteran American Airlines pilots have blamed the Colombian
air traffic controller, saying the controller and the pilot did
not understand each other, partly because of language problems.
</P>
<P>
But Civil Aeronautics regional director Carlos Rubio dismissed
the pilots' comments as "speculation."
</P>
<P>
The Public Magistrates Office will also investigate why radar
has not been installed in the town of Buga, even though new
equipment had been bought by authorities after the town's radar
system was blown up by guerrillas three years ago.

BRASILIA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian exports hit a record
46.5 billion U.S. dollars in 1995 with export volume surpassing
that of 1994 by 6.8 percent, a Brazilian official said today.
</P>
<P>
Mauricio Cortes, secretary of Brazil's Industry, Commerce and

exports and imports stood at 3.1 billion dollars, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said last year's exports of industrialized products jumped
by 8.98 percent over 1994 and exports to Asian countries were up
17.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
Japan was in first place as an importer of Brazilian products,
accounting for 38 percent of total exports to Asia. China's
imports of Brazilian soybean oil rose by 22 percent, becoming the
biggest buyer of this commodity.

BANGKOK, January 5 (Xinhua) -- A huge inflow of foreign capital

If too much short-term funds flowed into the country, the
economy would suffer in the long term, he added.

He said foreigners were also watching the inflow of funds and
there was a danger they would think Thailand relied too much on
short-term funds.

An estimated 500 billion baht (20 billion US dollars) flowed

BANGKOK, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Thai army commander General
Pramon Palasin has said that both Thai and Myanmar troops should
be withdrawn from the disputed Doi Lang mountain at the
Thai-Myanmar border to avoid conflicts, the local press said
today.
</P>
<P>
He said that the dispute over an area of 31 square kilometers
at Doi Lang in Mae Ai district of the northern Thai province of
Chiang Mai should be left for the Thai Survey Department and the
Foreign Ministry to negotiate with Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Both Thailand and Myanmar have claimed the area based on
different maps and documents. The area had been held by drug
warlord Khun Sa's Mong Tai army, serving as a buffer until the
area was taken over by Myanmar troops Monday.
</P>
<P>
"It is not that we would be prepared to fight for it," the Thai
army chief said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Thai Defense Permanent Secretary General Paiboon
Emphand ruled out the possibility of Thailand's allowing Khun Sa
to take asylum because he is a criminal wanted by the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Khun Sa would be arrested if he came to Thailand, said General
Paiboon.

President Burhanuddin Rabbani and head of the delegation, and some
senior Pakistani intelligence officials discussed the strained
Pakistan-Afghan relations and the current situation in
Afghanistan.

month to bring all warring factions to the negotiation table and
find a solution to end the civil war there since 1992.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian peace mission invited Taliban leaders to Tehran for
further talks. However, Taliban was reportedly not eager to
accept the invitation.

<P>
BANGKOK, January 5 (Xinhua) -- Opium warlord Khun Sa, who
surrendered to Myanma government troops Monday, will not be sent
to the United States for trial, Myanma ambassador to Thailand Tin
Winn was quoted as saying by the local press today.
</P>
<P>
He was commenting on a US offer of a two-million-US-dollar
award for information leading to the arrest and conviction of Khun
Sa.
</P>
<P>
Khun Sa has been indicted in the US on drug trafficking
charges. The US was the main destination of the drugs produced in
the golden triangle, part of which had been under Khun Sa's
control for four decades.
</P>
<P>
The Myanma ambassador said last night that Myanmar does not
have extradition agreement with any country and that Khun Sa would
be dealt with under the Myanma law.
</P>
<P>
Khun Sa could face either death or life imprisonment for drugs
trafficking, according to the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
But he added that Khun Sa might be given special consideration
and has his punishment reduced.
</P>
<P>
Khun Sa is widely believed to have reached a truce deal with
the Myanma government and to be now living in his jungle
headquarters in east Myanmar under the protection of Myanmar
troops
</P>
<P>
The government troops took over Khun Sa's stronghold in Ho Mong
Monday without resistance from Khun Sa's well-equipped Mong Tai
army, believed to be 6,000-8,000 strong.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Overseas Business Groups Aim at China (by Li Huailin) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 5 (Xinhua) -- With the new year's arrival,
several large overseas business groups held press conferences here
this week to announce their 1996's schemes for enhancing their
presence in China.
</P>
<P>
Emerson Electric Co., one of the major US-based manufacturers
of electrical and electronic products, said that it will set up
three new joint ventures in China for the manufacture of major
industrial products.
</P>
<P>
Emerson's new joint ventures in China include Rosemount Far
East Instrument Co. Ltd. in Beijing, Shenyang Copeland Compressors
Company Ltd. in Shenyang and Zhejiang Emerson Motor Co. in Huzhou
city.
</P>
<P>
Rosemount Far East Instrument Co. Ltd. is to be set up in April
1996 for the manufacture and service of pressure and temperature
transmitters for oil and gas, petrochemical, power and other
process industries in China.
</P>
<P>
Shenyang Copeland Compressors Company Ltd. to be set up in
January 1996 will manufacture semi-hermetic compressors and
condensing units for commercial refrigeration and air-conditioning
markets.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang Emerson Motor Co. to start operation in January this
year will engage in the manufacture of fractional horsepower
motors for appliance and room air-conditioner markets in China.
</P>
<P>
Charles F. Knight, chairman and chief executive officer of
Emerson, said that China is an important market in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that the three joint ventures are expected to play key
roles in Emerson's growth in China as well as in the entire
Asia-Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
Emerson Electric has sub-companies in Hangzhou, Tianjin,
Shanghai, Shenzhen and Xiamen and it has also set up sale offices
in Beijing, Guangzhou, Xi'an, Wuhan, Dalian, Tianjin, Xiamen and
Chengdu.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hong Kong-based New China HK Group Limited also
announced here early this week that it had signed an Acquisition
and Development Agreement to form a holding company with two
leading US power corporations to jointly develop power plants in
China.
</P>
<P>
K.T. Tong, managing director of the New China HK Group, said
that the aim of establishing a holding company is to build new
power plants or to expand existing ones and to facilitate the
transfer of technological and management skills.
</P>
<P>
Tong said that the demand for energy supply in China is
escalating and it will continue to rise with further industrial
and infrastructure development in the country.
</P>
<P>
The New China HK Group has already identified two power plants
for development, Wuxian Leekou Thermal Power Plant Co. Ltd. in
Wuxian city and Jiangyin Sanfangxiang Power Plant Co. Ltd..
</P>
<P>
With an existing installed capacity of 27 MW and 15 MW at
Wuxian Power Plant and Jiangyin Sanfangxiang Power Plant, the New
China Hong Kong Power Limited plans to expand their installed
capacity to 39 MW and 24 MW by the end this year.
</P>
<P>
Total investment of the two projects is estimated to reach RMB
295 million yuan (about 35.5 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to Tong, the group is now working on feasibility
studies for a number of potential projects. "For the longer term,
it plans to develop medium and large size power projects," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The group is also engaged in the construction of a 90-kilometer
toll expressway linking Chengdu and Mianyang in Sichuan province
and other projects in Suzhou, Harbin, Guangzhou and Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Australian Current Account Deficit Rises in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The current account deficit of
Australia resurged in November after remaining steady in the
previous months, according to a report released today by the
Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS).
</P>
<P>
The current account deficit reached 1.866 billion Australian
dollars (1.381 billion US dollars) seasonally adjusted in
November, the ABS announced.
</P>
<P>
It was 11-percent higher than the figure for October, which was
revised up to 1.682 billion Australian dollars (1.25 billion US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
Today's figure exceeded market expectations of a current
account deficit up to 1.7 billion Australian dollars (1.258
billion US dollars) in November.
</P>
<P>
The market has been accustomed to a monthly current account
deficit of around 1.5 billion Australian dollars (1.11 billion US
dollars) in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Treasury has revised down the budgetary current
account deficit for the fiscal year to 21 billion Australian
dollars (15.5 billion US dollars) from the original 27 billion
Australian dollars (20 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The ABS figures showed that the resurge of the current account
deficit in the end of 1995 was due to a four-percent rise in
imports and a three-percent fall in exports.
</P>
<P>
But the local financial market basically ignored the
worse-than-predicted current account figures because they are
unlikely to bear any effect on interest rates.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to become a
giant producer of medicines and pharmaceutical instruments by the
middle of next century, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
By 2050, a highly modernized pharmaceutical industry should be
up and running, with a good distribution of products, said Zheng
Xiaoyu of the State Pharmaceutical Administration (SPA) at the
opening of a four-day national meeting on pharmaceutical
development.
</P>
<P>
The SPA is mapping out a 15-year national program for the
industry's development, Zheng was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Annual pharmaceutical industrial output value over the next
five years should reach 200 billion yuan ( about 23 billion
U.S. dollars), double the figure for last year.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, annual sales volumes should be 150 billion yuan (about
17 billion U.S. dollars) and 6.5 billion dollars worth of
pharmaceutical products will be exported.
</P>
<P>
Quality of pharmaceutical products must be further improved to
meet public demand and to ensure realization of the State promise
of "health for all" by the end of the century, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Zheng said Preferential policies will be implemented to support
the development of the pharmaceutical industry in the inland and
western parts of China.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises which are not successful in their production and
exports and those who pollute the environment must be closed down
or forced to make other products, Zheng said.
</P>
<P>
Units manufacturing fake and substandard medicines and
pharmaceutical instruments must be stopped. Scientific research
will be carried out to develop more and new varieties of
medicines, the official said.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, annual sales volumes of at least 10 large-scale
pharmaceutical industrial enterprises should surpass five billion
yuan (about 588 million U.S. dollars). Three of them are currently
among the world's top 100 pharmaceutical firms.
</P>
<P>
Zheng said that the country will also extend cooperation with
foreign countried over the next five years to connect Chinese
pharmaceutical production more closely with international markets.

<HEADLINE> French Radio Stations Required to Play More French Songs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 5 (Xinhua) -- French radio broadcasters will
risk fines or suspension if they do not abide by a new law aimed
at promoting French songs.
</P>
<P>
The law, which took effect from January 1, obliges radio
stations to play French songs on at least 40 percent of their
airtime between 6.30 a.m. and 10.30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
The law, which was approved by parliament in February 1994,
aims to protect French audio-video products from the dominance of
U.S. and British films and songs.
</P>
<P>
All the 1,300 radio stations in France must meet the 40 percent
quota. In addition, new French songs and new singers must account
for half of the quota.
</P>
<P>
France has long sought to defend its culture from English,
including imposing quotas on Hollywood television productions.
The effort has paid off with some radios broadcasting French songs
over 30 percent of airtime in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
However, the new law has been slammed by French radio stations,
which call it an attack on personal freedom.

Caroline Davigny, head of programming at Fun Radio, which
targets a youthful audience with Anglo-Saxon music, said that the
radio's audience had declined since it began raising the share of
French songs from about 20 percent a year ago.
</P>
<P>
A radio broadcaster's union has said the law should be at least
suspended to discuss possible changes.
</P>
<P>
Even many radio stations that already play mostly French music
are wary, fearing the law could impose a monotonous uniformity.
</P>
<P>
But Patrick Zelnik, president of music store chain Virgin
France, defended the quotas as a national effort to give French
artists a chance against imports and preserve the diversity of
French culture.

<HEADLINE> China's Industry up 14 Percent in 1995 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- China generated industrial added
value of more than 2,300 billion yuan in 1995, an increase of 14
percent over the previous year, the State Statistics Bureau said
here today.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate in 1995 was four percentage points less than in
1994.
</P>
<P>
The light industry growth rate was up by 16 percent, four
percentage points more than that of heavy industry, which was
affected by the reduction of investment in fixed assets.
</P>
<P>
The growth speed of state-owned industry increased somewhat
last year, narrowing the gap in the growth of the different
industrial sectors as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The production of most light and textile goods, energy,
chemicals and farm-use goods registered a relatively bigger
increase whereas that of machinery and metallurgical industrial
products increased at a slow pace.

<HEADLINE> Two Killed by Unprecedented Floods in Romania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, January 4 (Xinhua) -- At least two people have been
killed by what appeared to be the worst floods for decades that
have swept almost half of Romania since late December, the local
press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The floods, which broke out late last month as rivers overflew
with melting snow water and torrential rains, have affected 25 of
the country's 40 counties.
</P>
<P>
The floods swallowed several drilling wells of the oil fields
in the south, large stretches of farm fields and thousands of
villagers' houses.
</P>
<P>
As a result, power transmission facilities were damaged and
some road and railway services were cut off.
</P>
<P>
Corncliu Timoiu, Director of the National Water Council, said
property damage and losses could exceed those of the worst flood
disaster hitting Romania in 1970.
</P>
<P>
By the end of December, the Romanian government has provided
100 million lei (about 389,105 U.S. dollars) of relief supplies to
flood-hit areas.

<P>
MADRID, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Spanish police today burned 36
tons of marijuana, valued at 41.3 million U.S. dollars, seized two
days ago in the biggest drug bust in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Police loaded the drugs onto two trucks and escorted them to a
wasteland where they were set ablaze. The burning lasted for six
hours.
</P>
<P>
Spanish police and customs officers seized the drugs on a cargo
ship at the port of Marin in northwest Spain.
</P>
<P>
Police sources said they raided the Panamanian-registered ship,
Volga I, when the crew started to unload fish powder before dawn
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
About 1,400 bags of marijuana were found and 17 suspects, most
of them Russians, were arrested. They have confessed that they
were hired by an international drug-trafficking ring.
</P>
<P>
The vessel had been under surveillance for a month, police

<HEADLINE> Bosnia Disarmament Talks Delayed Over Name Republika Srpska </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Bosnia disarmament talks
scheduled for Thursday afternoon were postponed until Friday after
Bosnian government officials protested against the words
"Republika Srpska" on a Bosnian Serb name-plate at the conference
table.
</P>
<P>
They argued that the name meant that the Bosnian Serbs were
being officially recognized as a separate state, not as part of
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Dayton peace accord between the warring
parties in the former Yugoslavia states that Bosnia-Herzegovina is
one nation consisting of two entities -- the Muslim-Croat
federation and territory allocated to the Bosnian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
The disarmament talks, sponsored by the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, were to have taken place in
Austria's former imperial palace, the Hofburg, in Vienna Thursday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Besides the two parties, the talks were to involve Croatia and
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Muslim-Croat federation and Bosnian Serbs held a
separate round of confidence-building talks earlier in the day in
Vienna. The two sides were reported to be near an agreement on the
establishment of military liaison missions based in the Bosnian
capital of Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
The Dayton peace accord requires the exchange of information
between the Bosnian government and Bosnian Serbs on sensitive
issues, such as the number and location of heavy weapons, sites of
arms factories and military training plans.
</P>
<P>
The Dayton treaty also stipulates that an agreement on arms
control must be reached by June 6 this year. If not, the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia will have to cut its troops by 25 percent
and the Bosnian government will be allowed to maintain a military
force twice as strong as that of the Bosnian Serbs.

<HEADLINE> China Makes Its Mark Protecting Trade Names </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 5 (Xinhua) -- More than half a million
trademarks have been registered in China, putting it among the top
ten countries in the world, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The trademark administration was fundamentally developed during
the 1990-1995 period.
</P>
<P>
The paper noted that the drafting of new laws and regulations
concerning trademarks established a stronger legal basis for the
administration and improved the protection of trademarks.
</P>
<P>
This has led to 540,000 trademarks being registered.
</P>
<P>
"The State administration has strictly implemented the
Trademark Law and relevent regulations and, as a result,
effectively protected trademarks and the legal rights and
interests of manufacturers and consumers at home and aboard," the
paper quoted a State trademark watchdog as saying.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years administrations of industry and
commerce have investigated almost 65,000 cases involving the
infringement of trademarks. They have fined trademark violators a
total of 137 million yuan and taken 630 cases to courts.
</P>
<P>
"The number of trademarks registered by foreign companies in
China has been on the rise over the past few years, which
demonstrates their confidence in China's trademark protection
system."
</P>
<P>
"Almost all well-known foreign brands have been registered in
China but about half of the registered foreign trademarks have not
actually entered the Chinese market," said an official with the
Trade Mark Bureau of the State Administration for Industry and
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
The number of applications for new trademark registration in
the past five years was twice the number for the 1986-1990
period. More and more manufacturers, even those in Qinghai
province, Ningxia and Tibet autonomous regions are paying
attention to the protection of intellectual property rights.
</P>
<P>
An official report estimated that the number of foreign
trademarks registered by the end of 1995 would be 80,000. The
number registered during the 1991-1995 period was expected to
equal the total for the previous four decades.
</P>
<P>
To date, China has attended all the major international
conventions concerning trademarks, including the Paris Convention
for the Protection of Industrial Property, the Madrid Agreement
concerning International Registration of Trademarks and the Nice
Agreement and the Trademark Law Treaty.

Meanwhile, foreign investment in China rose 11 percent to hit
37 billion US dollars last year, Ye said.

The state's foreign exchange reserve also went up to more than
70 billion US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Therapy Trial on HIV Infected Twins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 5 (Xinhua) -- The Gene Shears company of
Australia will experiment with a new genetic therapy of HIV/AIDS
by transplanting engineered blood cells between twins this year.
</P>
<P>
The gene shears technology was developed by the Division of
Plant of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research
Organization (CSIRO) of Australia in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Recent experiments in laboratory proved that the technology
developed for curbing plant virus is also highly effective in
restraining HIV.
</P>
<P>
The clinical trials involve five pairs of twins, one of each of
whom is infected with HIV.
</P>
<P>
T-cells, a kind of white blood cells, will be taken from each
healthy twin and genetically engineered. A special gene will be
inserted into the DNA of the T-cells to enable it to produce a
ribozyme, an enzyme specially designed to chop up HIV.
</P>
<P>
Then the strengthened T-cells will be infused into the HIV
positive twins. Though the T-cells will not multiply in the bodies
of the twins, researchers hope that they will add to the twins'
immune power by producing ribozyme.
</P>
<P>
Researchers hope that ribozyme will stop HIV from infecting
healthy cells and curb the replication of the virus in infected
cells.
</P>
<P>
The patent of the hammerhead ribozyme is held by the Gene
Shears Pty Ltd., jointly owned by Johnson and Johnson of the
United States and Group Limagrain of France.
</P>
<P>
Ribozyme will not cure AIDS, but neutralize it by giving the
immune system time to recover resistance to the virus, according
to Leigh Farrell, general manager of the Gene Shears company.
</P>
<P>
The clinical trials will be carried in four phases. If
successful, the trials are expected to lead to commercially
available HIV therapy in five to six years.
</P>
<P>
Similar trials using stem cells will also be carried out in the
US later this year.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine, U.S. Agree to Upgrade Military Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian Defense Minister Valery
Shmarov and his U.S. counterpart William Perry today signed an
agreement on military cooperation, including exchanges of military
personnel and joint military exercises.
</P>
<P>
Perry expressed the U.S. hope to strengthen the partnership
with Ukraine in defense and to support U.S. investment and trade
activities in the country, the press office of the U.S. embassy in
Ukraine said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the talks on arms reduction, Shmarov said the
Ukrainian Parliament has formed a special committee to solve the
issue of peaceful use of the rocket launching facilities within
the Ukrainian territories.
</P>
<P>
In October 1993, the Ukrainian Parliament approved a document
on demolishing the missile launching silos that it inherited from
the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Shmarov said the fourth of the five underground launching silos
would be destroyed in Pervomaisk in central Ukraine on Friday.
The other four will be destroyed by June this year.
</P>
<P>
Perry said that under the declaration signed by the presidents
of the U.S., Russia and Ukraine in Moscow in January 1994, Ukraine
should destroy 36 percent of the underground launching silos,
except for some of its necessary facilities that can be converted
to civilian use in the country's national economy.
</P>
<P>
Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev, who also held talks
with Perry and Shmarov earlier today, confirmed that Ukraine had
shipped 36 percent of the nuclear warheads to Russia for
destruction in compliance with the declaration.
</P>
<P>
He said the Russian and Ukrainian Defense Ministries will meet
in March to discuss other military issues.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Swimmer Foschi Denies Steroid Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Olympic swimming hopeful
Jessica Foschi denied on Thursday that she had never used steroid
in her career.
</P>
<P>
The 15-year-old distance swimmer tested positive for the
anabolic steroid mesterolone last summer and was placed on a
two-year probation by a U.S. Swimming Board of Review, a decision
that has been criticised as too lenient.
</P>
<P>
In a written essay in the January issue of Swimming World
magazine, Foschi claims she is innocent of any wrongdoing and does
not deserve to be tagged a cheater.
</P>
<P>
"I have never knowingly taken a steroid or any other banned
substance," Foschi writes. "Not once, not ever. I love to swim and
I like to do well, but I would never consider taking drugs to
improve my performance."
</P>
<P>
Foschi said she and her family were stunned when informed of
the positive drug test. "There had to be a mistake," she said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Swimming president Carol Zaleski, who favours a two-year
ban rather than probation, has scheduled a January 20 hearing in
Colorado Springs to appeal the probation decision.
</P>
<P>
FINA, the sport's international governing body, is also
reviewing the probation called "a tiny slap on the wrist" by many
in the swimming world.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. Secretary of
State Henry Kissinger was lobbying the White House Thursday to
salvage an international soccer tournament threatened by a
U.S. government shutdown.
</P>
<P>
Because of the partial shutdown, players from world champion
Brazil, Mexico and other countries have been unable to obtain
U.S. visas at American embassies in their homelands to play in the
CONCACAF Gold Cup here later this month.
</P>
<P>
Officials of CONCACAF, the umbrella soccer federation for
North and Central America and the Caribbean, said Thursday they
had approached Kissinger to lobby the White House and State
Department to try and get special dispensations to allow the
two-week Gold Cup tournament to take place.
</P>
<P>
The Gold Cup is scheduled to be played in Los Angeles, Anaheim
and San Diego, California January 10-21. Besides Brazil and
Mexico, the tournament includes the national teams of the United
States, Canada, Honduras, Guatemala, Trinidad and Tobago, El
Salvador and St. Vincent and the Grenadines.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which won the
World Cup in the United States in 1994, threatened to pull out if
its players are not given visas by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian Football Confederation (CFB) president Ricardo
Teixeira said he had asked Brazil's ambassador in Washington to
attempt to solve the problem. Brazil's squad was due to leave for
the tournament on Sunday.

<P>
The New Area's export products cover textiles, and mechanical
and electrical products, light industrial products, metals and
minerals, chemicals, medicines, and agricultural and sideline
foodstuff. And textiles and mechanical and electrical products are
the top exports.
</P>
<P>
Japan, the United States, Germany, Southeast Asian nations, the
European Community, the Republic of Korea (ROK), Hong Kong and
Taiwan are its top seven export markets.
</P>
<P>
A large part of the export growth is attributed to growth in
the processing of imported materials. More investment is coming
from the Western countries after Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and
Southeastern Asian nations. And labor-intensive products, such as
garments, toys, arts and handicrafts, are gradually giving way to
chemicals, instruments, and mechanical and electrical products.
</P>
<P>
Observers here predict that, with the operation of a new policy
in November last year that allows major exporters to set up
subordinate firms in Pudong, the New Area will be able to enjoy a
still brisker export growth this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Pierre Lartigue of France in a
Citroen and Italy's Edi Orioli on a Yamaha led the Grenada-Dakar
rally rankings after the sixth stage from Smara, Morocco, to
Zouerat in Mauretania on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The day's car section honours after the 620km stage, including
603km of specials, went to France's Jean-Pierre Fontenay in a
Mitsubishi in the car's section.
</P>
<P>
Fontenay's win on the day breaks the Citroen hegemony in the
car section, with the rest of the top five all driving the French
company's vehicles.
</P>
<P>
Finland's Ari Vatanen lost ground after losing nearly two hours
with a puncture which forced him to drive on the rim for some 140
km. He now stands fourth with one hour and 36 minutes behind
Lartigue, winner of the event for the past two years.
</P>
<P>
In the motorcycles section there was a surprise as Orioli won
through to move to the head of the overall standings.
</P>
<P>
Off the track, race authorities said an enquiry by Moroccan
officials into the death of French driver Laurent Gueguen on
Wednesday had determined that his vehicle had not hit a mine.
</P>
<P>
There had been speculation that his Mercedes had caught fire
after hitting a mine left over just off-track from the recent war
between Morocco and Polisario Front separatists, but witnesses
reoprted seeing his truck ablaze before it turned onto its side.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, French motorcyclist Thierry Rannou, who had been in
a coma Wednesday after a crash, was said to be recovering slowly
in hospital in Tenerife, race organisers said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Denmark's Bjarne Goldbaek on
Thursday threatened to sue German football if they do not
implement new European Union (EU) rules immediately.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the European Court of Justice ruled Jean-Marc
Bosman, in defiance of the Treaty of Rome, was illegally prevented
from leaving his Belgian club and joining a French side.
</P>
<P>
The court said this restricted the free movement of EU workers
and also ruled all clubs could play as many foreigners as they
liked, instead of the three-player maximum in most countries.
</P>
<P>
However Cologne's Goldbaek, one of five foreigners in the
squad, is anxious Germany's 36 professional clubs might decide on
Sunday to shelve the new rules till the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
This would keep Goldbaek, who is not one of the three regular
foreign starters at Cologne, in the reserves.

LAGOS, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria said on Thursday that it
would maintain its decision to withdraw its team from the African
Nations' Cup soccer tournament.
</P>
<P>
"There is no change. Our position is still the same and the
(CAF) ultimatum means nothing to us", said Sports Minister Jim
Nwobodo.
</P>
<P>
Cameroon-based CAF president Issa Hayatou immediately left for
Lagos, where he was to meet Nwobodo in a last ditch attempt to
change the Nigerians' mind.
</P>
<P>
The CAF has given Nigeria until midnight to make up its mind on
whether or not it will participate in the tournament, which opens
next week in South Africa. Nigeria are the holders, but face
being banned for the next two tournaments through to 2000 if they
refuse to compete this time.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria decided to pull out last Saturday because its squad
feared for its safety in South Africa, where the cup is being
staged from January 13.

<HEADLINE> Bildt Satisfied With Development in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Carl Bildt, the EU High
Representative for Bosnian reconstruction, said today the
situation on the ground was much better than expected and the
former warring sides were determined to establish a lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
"The key to peace lies in the hands of the people and
leadership of the two entities in Bosnia" -- the Muslim-Croat
federation and the Republika Srpska, Bildt said after meeting with
Bosnian Serb Vice-President Biljana Plavsic and Prime Minister
Rajko Kasagic in Banja Luka, the largest Serb city in northwestern
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The former Swedish prime minister, who flew into Sarajevo on
Wednesday, said although mistrust was still running high, he was
moderately optimistic regarding the organization of elections,
return of refugees and creation of a normal political climate.
</P>
<P>
"Enormous economic and political tasks that lie ahead should
enable the former enemies to become partners," Tanjug news agency
quoted Bildt as saying.
</P>
<P>
On the future economic reconstruction, the peace co-ordinator
said the international community "will give economic assistance to
the process of Bosnia's reconstruction if a sound monetary system
is created and customs and other barriers are lifted."
</P>
<P>
The international community has donated 500 million U.S.
dollars to Bosnia for initial economic recovery project for the
first three months of this year. Other money needed for the
reconstruction will be collected in the next donors' conference
scheduled for March in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Serb Vice-President Plavsic told reporters that
confidence-building among peoples in Bosnia was of primary
importance and that international organizations could help a lot
in the process.
</P>
<P>
The Serb authority released today 16 Muslims they detained last
week in the Serb-held Sarajevo district Ilidza under strong
pressure from the international community.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Kasagic said he expected the sanctions against
the Serb republic would be lifted in keeping with the peace
agreement and that it was high time for the two entities to
establish cooperation, especially in the economic field. The
sanctions will not be lifted until the elections in Bosnia is held
in autumn this year.
</P>
<P>
"Reconstruction will not be an easy task because the damage
Republika Srpska has sustained during the war amounts to 15
billion U.S. dollars," the prime minister added.

<HEADLINE> London Stock Exchange Ousts Chief Executive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- The London Stock Exchange (LSE)
today forced its chief executive Michael Lawrence to resign after
the board meeting concluded there had been a "loss of confidence"
in him.
</P>
<P>
The move caused stirs in London's financial district as one of
its flagship institutions, the LSE, had already been trapped in a
fierce debate over its future.
</P>
<P>
John Kemp-Welch, chairman of the LSE, told a press conference
that the board had required Lawrence's resignation "with immediate
effect".
</P>
<P>
"It was genuinely not a single episode, it was an accumulation
of matter," Kemp-Welch said.
</P>
<P>
"He (Lawrence) had failed to win the confidence of market
firms, both large and small, and his relationships with the Stock
Exchange board had for several months been unsatisfactory," he
said.
</P>
<P>
But the chairman did not specify the reason for sacking
Lawrence, 52, who became LSE cheif executive in February 1994.
</P>
<P>
Kemp-Welch denied Lawrence was scapegoat for controversies last
year, including the move towards order-driven trading, which met
strong oppostion from LSE members and was described by senior
executive as the genuine cause behind Lawrance's loss of
popularity.
</P>
<P>
The LSE board voted in November last year to proceed with the
introduction of order-driven, fully electronic share trading
system for the supplement of the traditional market marking
practice, in which large companies guarantee, as market middlemen,
to buy and sell shares at publicly quoted prices.
</P>
<P>
Some of the large market making firm expressed reservation for
the new system for fear of losing their advantage in the market.
</P>
<P>
Lawrence is the second chief executive of the LSE to be forced
to leave the post, following Peter Rawlings who left in March 1993
after the embarrassing and costly failure of the LSE's electronic
share settlement system, Taurus.

WASHINGTON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher will be traveling this afternoon to the Wye
Plantation conference center on Maryland's Eastern Shore to join
the second round of peace talks between Syria and Israel.
</P>
<P>
"He's going to have a dinner and discussion with the Israeli,
Syrian and American negotiators at Wye," State Department
spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters at today's news briefing.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary intends to have a solid and substantive
discussion tonight with all the negotiators," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
Christopher wants to assess what progress has been made, in
preparation for his meetings with Syrian President Hafez Assad and
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres during his four-day visit to
the Middle East next week.
</P>
<P>
Burns described the secretary's trip to Wye as "normal thing,"
saying that "I wouldn't see this as the secretary rushing in at
some climatic moment of the negotiations."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman didn't think the peace is just around the corner.
"We are at a moment where we're trying to renew and revitalize the
Syrian-Israeli track of negotiations, we're just at the beginning
of that," he added.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that a peace agreement will be realized sometime in
1996, a comprehensive peace agreement to end all of the
outstanding issues of difference between Syria and Israel that
have existed for nearly 50 years," Burns said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- A scheduled meeting between
U.S. President Bill Clinton and congressional Republican leaders
over the budget impasse has been postponed.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for House Speaker Newt Gingrich said today the
meeting was postponed owing to "congressional business" the
speaker needed to attend to.
</P>
<P>
A White House spokesman said the administration expects the
talks to resume Friday and aides said they did not view the
postponement as a sign that the talks were in trouble.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich and Senate Republican leader Bob Dole had been
scheduled to attend the White House meeting Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Dole's office, too, confirmed the postponement of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
However, House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich, and
Senate Budget Committee Chairman Pete Domenici still met at the
White House Thursday with chief of staff Leon Panetta.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Kasich said the two chairmen would return to
the Capitol by the middle of Thursday afternoon to brief Dole and
Gingrich on the closed discussion. A decision to reschedule the
high-level meeting could be made after that briefing, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Thursday, House Democratic leader Richard Gephardt told
reporters that the negotiations, held since the beginning of the
second government shutdown on December 16, were focused on
allowing the two sides to learn each other's positions.
</P>
<P>
Among the issues being discussed, he said, were tax cuts, cuts
in Medicare and Medicaid program spending, and the funding levels
of federal agencies through the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
"Will that allow both sides to come to some sort of agreement?
I don't know," he said. "With that kind of exchange of information
-- we all get frustrated by how long it takes to do that -- but it
has been useful in trying to get to a good outcome."
</P>
<P>
The partial shutdown of the federal government has lasted 20
days, idling 260,000 federal workers and affecting millions of
other Americans.

Clinton had said that he wanted to travel to Bosnia during the
Christmas-New Year holiday season, but his military advisers at
the Pentagon asked him to wait until the 20,000 U.S. IFOR complete
its main deployment in the former Yugoslav republic in
mid-January.

U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry paid a one-day visit to
Bosnia Wednesday, becoming the first U.S. cabinet minister to
visit the Balkan state ravaged by nearly four years of civil war.
</P>
<P>
Perry, accompanied by General John Shalikashvili, chairman of
the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, met with U.S. IFOR commanders and
toured the NATO IFOR operation headquarters set up in Sarajevo
after the alliance took over from U.N. peacekeeping forces last
month.

BC-Nigeria-Africa Soccer Cup
afg010429hke -- Nigeria's Stand On Africa Soccer Cup Unchanged
</P>
<P>
LAGOS, January 4 (Xinhua) -- A Nigerian minister said today
Nigeria's position remains unchanged in relation to its
participation in the 1996 Africa Cup of Nations soccer
competition scheduled for this month in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Youth and Sports Minister Jim Nwobodo made the remarks in
Nigeria's capital Abuja in reaction to a 48-hour ultimatum issued
by the Confederation of African Football (CAF).
</P>
<P>
"There is no change. Our position is still the same and the
ultimatum means nothing to us," he told newsmen.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria announced on December 30, 1995, that it would pull out
of the 20th African Cup of Nations soccer competition because of
the serious security concern with Nigerian players during the
competition in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The CAF yesterday gave Nigeria up to tonight to reconsider its
stand or face a possible six-year ban from all competitions it
organizes.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government has weighed all the implications of
not participating in the championship before it decided to
withdraw the national football team, the Super Eagles, from
defending the Cup they won in Tunisia in 1994, Nwobodo said.
</P>
<P>
The minister accused South Africa of politicizing sports and
of withdrawing its invitation to Nigeria to take part in a
four-nation invitational tournament which the country hosted late
last year.
</P>
<P>
He said he understands the sentiments of Nigerian football
lovers in regard to the Super Eagles' participation in the
championship, but pointed out that the security of the players is
paramount.

<HEADLINE> US Government Shutdown Affects Economic Forecasts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 4 (Xinhua) -- Due to the partial shutdown
of the federal government, forecasting the economy in the United
States has been badly affected for the lack of critical data.
</P>
<P>
Most employees of the Commerce and Labor Department agencies
that collect and analyze data on such issues as consumer spending,
employment, housing and inflation have been suspended.
</P>
<P>
The most immediate impact is on Wall Street, where economic
perceptions based in large part on government statistics influence
multimillion-dollar decisions and many businesses also use the
economic reports, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
However, the common people could be consequently affected if
the lack of reliable data causes policy-makers to misread the
economy, resulting in slower growth and loss of jobs -- or higher
inflation and loss of purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
In an attempt to keep up with the economy, economists and
others who usually monitor the government's reports now are
working hard for wherever and whatever information may be
available.
</P>
<P>
Postponed reports include revisions in the third-quarter gross
domestic product (GDP), October international trade and November
housing starts. The December employment report scheduled for
Friday also has been delayed, as have December statistics on
inflation due out next week.
</P>
<P>
A senior official from the Commerce Department warned that if
data collection does not resume shortly, some material may be lost
for good. If so, it would be the first gap in a government
economic series since World War II. For instance, the Commerce
Department's Current Population Survey, used to determine the
nation's monthly unemployment rate, could be a case in point.
</P>
<P>
It was said that such a gap could cause problems for academic
researchers, but not for the economy.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve, which is not affected by the government
shutdown, combines the government reports with its own economic
data and other information when it considers monetary policy. But
policy-makers had to work without the revised third-quarter GDP
and November housing starts data when they decided December 19 to
cut interest rates to stimulate the economy.
