Column: Lehman hopes he can change ending
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By FRAN BLINEBURY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Huston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ You've been there before, they tell him. And
that's supposed to make Tom Lehman feel better.
</P>
<P>
   Like being tied to the tracks in front of a moving locomotive is
always much easier the second time around. Or standing before a
firing squad. Or having root canal without Novocain.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the fourth consecutive year that Lehman has teed
off in the final pairing of the U.S. Open, which is the golf
equivalent of going over Niagara Falls in a barrel. All you're
trying to do is make it in one piece.
</P>
<P>
   You know the sad history, you know that the last three trips
have wound up with him busted on the rocks and you figure that the
night before they strap him to the rack and start the torture all
over again, Lehman would either be climbing walls or one of the
many cypress trees that help make the Lake Course at the Olympic
Club a tight, tilted, twisted mind-trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids had a choice of going downtown to a puppet show or
going to the movies,'' Lehman said. ``They picked the movies. So
we're going to see Mulan.''
</P>
<P>
   If it had to be a Disney flick, you might think something
starring Goofy would have been more appropriate, since that's what
blowing three consecutive chances to win the Open could make
anyone.
</P>
<P>
   But Lehman doesn't look like a guy who has stayed up nights
muttering to himself in the dark, replaying the videotapes and
re-living the misery. And there is plenty of that.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, he entered the final round at Shinnecock Hills tied for
the lead with Greg Norman but faded to finish third as Corey Pavin
won the title.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Lehman held the 54-hole lead and played the last round
as a head-to-head duel with his buddy-on-tour Steve Jones. The two
devout Christians exchanged inspirational words throughout the
round, but it was Jones who was lifted to the win at Oakland Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the site was the Congressional Country Club and the
story was the same on the last day. Lehman led the field going in
but splashed his second shot on No. 17, taking himself out of
contention as Ernie Els claimed the championship.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's back, like Bill Murray in Groundhog Day and Sonny and
Cher are singing I Got You Babe in the background. But this time
there's a twist.
</P>
<P>
   While Lehman will be playing in the final twosome, this time he
and Bob Tway are leading the hunt behind Payne Stewart's four-shot
lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's definitely a difference,'' Lehman said. ``I
wouldn't say it would take a different approach to the way I play,
but there's a difference in how you feel.''
</P>
<P>
   When you're the leader, all eyes are on you. When you're the
leader at the U.S. Open and everybody is saying that all you have
to do to win the thing is hit the fairways and play solid golf,
those fairways start to look about as wide as a ruler and the only
thing solid is the weight on your back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure that everybody has probably been nervous at some
point in their life,'' Lehman said. ``So nervous that you almost
want to throw up. And the butterflies are there. They come and they
go. And it's not until you start to play that they kind of settle
down and go away.''
</P>
<P>
   Or don't go away, as has been Lehman's case.
</P>
<P>
   But for a warm, pleasant, surprising Saturday afternoon in the
Bay Area, when the only problem was a devilish breeze that made the
sloping fairways even harder to hold, Lehman pulled himself back
together after a second-round 75 with a 2-under-par 68 that was the
best score of the day. He used good middle irons to set himself up
for three birdies on the first three holes and then bogeyed the
next three. He chipped in from 15 feet on No. 14 for a birdie and
then hit a wedge to within six feet and birdied No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Though with a slightly different perspective as the chaser, this
brings him to this familiar position on the last day, trying to
shake off a reputation as a guy who can't handle the big-time
pressure. Which is certainly an odd tag for a player with four PGA
Tour victories and who won the British Open in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   So the question is whether it's fun or torture being in
contention on the last day of the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good question,'' Lehman said. ``It's fun, but not in the way
that going to Six Flags is fun or riding a roller coaster. That's
gut-busting lots of fun, and this is more of just an experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Like seeing the firing squad raise its rifles. Like seeing the
dentist approach with that drill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think this (Open) owes me one,'' Lehman said. ``But I
think I owe myself one.''
</P>
<P>
   He's been there before. And he can hear the train coming.

STEWART LEADS OPEN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By Michael Madden 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For all the reasons Payne Stewart is not only
leading the 98th US Open but also is the only golfer under par,
this may be the most telling: There have been 294 double bogeys
through three rounds, but none by Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Swirling winds and bright sun that firmed the fairways so that
the slightest miss caused shots to roll off them and into the
ever-deepening rough have humbled all who have teed it up at The
Olympic Club; all, that is, except Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   So Stewart is the improbable leader, firing a par 70 Saturday
that kept him in the same position at day's end as at day's
beginning _ 3 under par. Virtually all other golfers lost ground to
Stewart as he has a four-stroke lead over Tom Lehman (68_211) and
Bob Tway (73). His four-shot lead is the largest entering the final
round of the Open since Tony Jacklin also led by four in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Price (71) and Lee Janzen (73) are tied for fourth at 212.
Seven other golfers are within eight strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Improbable leader? Well, Stewart may have won the Open in 1991
at Hazeltine outside Minneapolis, but he has won only one other
tourney in the US in the eight years since (the 1995 Shell Houston
Open, beating Scott Hoch in a playoff). Stewart may have won
$8,465,062 in his career and may be the seventh-leading all-time
money winner, but tour wins have been scant, and few since he beat
Scott Simpson in a playoff to take his second major. He won the
1989 PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   If he wins Sunday, said Stewart, ``it would tell me that I still
have the ability to compete in a major championship. It would be
very, very special.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is precisely Stewart's consistency (``I'm just a
plodder,'' he says) that has nudged him to the top here, since even
the slightly errant shot is penalized so harshly. The way he looks
upon Olympic, said Stewart, ``is that par is a heck of a score on
every hole here.'' Little daring, nothing glamorous.
</P>
<P>
   Well, except for No. 1 perhaps, the par-5 533-yard hole that
Stewart has owned all three days. He eagled it Saturday (5-iron to
20 feet) after making birdie the first two rounds. ``It's wonderful
to get off to such a nice start,'' he said. ``It gets you in a good
frame of mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Which Stewart promises to be in Sunday. ``I'm a big advocate of
self-motivating myself and I just say to myself, `I've been here
before; I've done it; you're a champion,' and `There's no reason
why you can't be a champion again.'''
</P>
<P>
   One of the few golfers to make up ground on Stewart was Tom
Lehman, one of only three golfers to break par Saturday. Lehman, of
course, has been extremely close to winning the last three Opens _
third in 1995, second in 1996, and tied for the lead at
Congressional last year when his shot found the water on the 17th
hole on the final day and he finished third.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I don't think the Open owes me one,'' said Lehman. ``I
think I owe myself one, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman had walked off the 18th on Friday extremely angry, one of
the many players who complained about the pin placement atop a
slope on the 18th green. ``I was ready to take someone's head
off,'' he said. ``But (Saturday), I walked off the 18th feeling
very happy; it was a very good day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good'' because Lehman _ unlike so many other golfers _
``didn't shoot myself in the foot.'' Reflecting on his three close
calls the last three years, ``I think I've learned a lesson that I
have to be patient on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the many golfers who took a free fall Saturday, one of the
most painful was by amateur Matt Kuchar, who will turn 20 Sunday.
Kuchar was alone in second place, 1 over par, when he teed off on
the 14th hole, but he proceeded to three-putt the hole, the first
of four straight bogeys, which dropped him off the leaderboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my first real opportunity for a birdie out there,''
said the amateur, ``and I really goosed it. I got a little too
excited, and I hit it way too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Brad Faxon of Barrington, R.I., to whom the Open
never has been kind, was in ideal position Saturday to make his
first mark on an Open leaderboard as he started the day at 1 over,
four shots behind Stewart. Faxon needed only to play a consistent
round of near-par golf to be in the thick of the battle.
</P>
<P>
   But Faxon started the day with a bogey ``and I got off to a bad
start,'' he said. What followed was a ghastly front nine of 7-over
42. ``What I learned is that if you're not psyched and not in clear
focus out here, you're looking at a lot of bogeys,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Faxon double-bogeyed the the 438-yard fourth, but he really ran
into trouble on the 437-yard sixth, ``when my 6-iron went into some
hard ground and I really felt a jolt to my back,'' he said. ``I
couldn't loosen my back for a few holes.''
</P>
<P>
   Faxon, though, had a fine recovery on the back nine and came
home in a scintillating _ for this day of winds _ 34. ``I hit it as
good as I could hit it on the back nine,'' he said after finishing
a truly bizarre round of 76, leaving him 7 over for the tourney and
10 shots behind Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   So the Open Sunday clearly will be Stewart's to lose, since it
is extremely unlikely any golfer within sight of Stewart will go 4
or 5 under par. ``My mother is staying with me,'' said Stewart,
``and I'm sure I'll get a good night's sleep ... unless my mother
snores, that is.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   With Rob Deer, there rarely was a middle ground.
</P>
<P>
   Deer either smacked a pitch far over the outfield wall or struck
out mightily, the buttons on his shirt nearly bursting on every
swing.
</P>
<P>
   In 11 Major League Baseball seasons, Deer cranked 230 career
home runs. But he also struck out 1,409 times in 3,881 official
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a philosophy when I went up to the plate,'' said Deer,
who retired after the 1996 season. ``Swing as hard as you can, just
in case you hit it.''
</P>
<P>
   Makes you wonder how the 6-foot-4, 245-pound Deer will fare in
his post-baseball career, which at the moment, is drag racing.
</P>
<P>
   Deer either will blow the doors off a rival or get his 1955
Chevy BelAir off the starting line too early and red light, causing
an immediate disqualification.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hmmm, I hadn't thought about that,'' Deer said.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't matter. Deer, 37, is having too much fun and has too
many goals to worry about drag racing's hits and misses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I always knew I'd pursue this sport once my baseball
career ended,'' said Deer, who began his career in the San
Francisco Giants organization, but spent most of his career with
Milwaukee. ``My dad (Bob) always loved fast cars. He loved anything
fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to hide me in the trunk of the 1962 Chevy Impala that
he raced and sneak me into (defunct Orange County Raceway). He'd
put me in the grandstands and I'd watch him race. I fell in love
with it.''
</P>
<P>
   When Deer retired, he renewed that love and purchased a 1967
Chevy Camaro, which he raced in the National Hot Rod Association's
super street sportsman category.
</P>
<P>
   Later, he talked his parents into moving from California to
Mesa, where Deer has lived for several years, and persuaded his dad
to resume his own drag racing career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably had been 30 years since I last raced a car,'' said
Bob Deer, who is 60. ``I remember making my first pass out at
Speedworld (Motorplex) and thinking maybe I was in over my head. I
thought maybe I had lost some of my coordination. It's not like you
just get in these cars and step on the gas. There's a lot of things
to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've made several passes since then and now I kind of
think my car is too slow. It goes about 130 miles an hour, but I
want to go faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Deer now is driving the Camaro and Rob recently purchased a
1955 Chevy BelAir and competes in super gas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got a new motor for it,'' Deer said. ``It's got 540
cubic inches and 900 horsepower. It cost about $15,000. But we're
serious about this sport. I'm trying to earn enough points to
qualify for the World Finals.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Deer, who still works full time at Falcon Field, will travel
with his son next month to Sonoma, Calif., and compete in a
national event at Sears Point Raceway. Primarily, however, the
elder Deer's plans are to compete only locally at Speedworld,
Firebird International Raceway Park or Southwestern International
Raceway in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if this has brought us closer together because
Rob and I have always had a close relationship,'' Bob Deer said.
``But I can't tell you how much of a thrill it is to go up to the
starting line and see your son over in the next lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how many fathers and sons get to do something
like that. It's really fun and a special feeling. I beat him the
first time, but he's beaten me every time since.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Deer understands his dad's excitement, because he's
experiencing the same inner sensations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've hit some home runs in my career that were pretty big and
memorable,'' Deer said. ``I remember I hit one on Easter Sunday in
'88 when I was with Milwaukee that helped us win our 13th straight
game to open the season. That still gives me goose bumps. The next
week, I was in a store and I saw my picture on the cover of
``Sports Illustrated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But you wouldn't believe how exciting it is to win a round
against another driver in a drag race. The cars are so loud and the
window gets fogged up when you're there at the starting line. It's
a real kick in the pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball was my life for 20 years, but I was thinking about
racing even when I was playing. I remember Robin Yount and I used
to talk about racing a lot. Whenever the Indy 500 came on every
year, Robin made sure it was on the television in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never that much into that kind of racing or even NASCAR
racing. What I really like are these (NHRA) door slammers. That's
my future right now. That's all I'm thinking about.'' &QL;

MESSED UP IN HEAD 
 MARINERS, ACE STRUGGLE WITH MENTAL SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   By just about anyone's account, the Seattle Mariners are not a
very good team right now. Expected to win the American League West,
the Mariners are languishing in their division's cellar with a
30-44 record.
</P>
<P>
   The easy culprit to blame for Seattle's awful season is the
bullpen, which has been atrocious since the first week of the
season. This club's real problems, however, lie in the front
office.
</P>
<P>
   Unwilling to pull the trigger on the trade that would have sent
Randy Johnson to Los Angeles for Ismael Valdes and Wilton Guerrero
this month further sent Johnson spiraling deeper into the funk he
had been in since before spring training.
</P>
<P>
   Other players followed Johnson into the abyss they've been in
since the trade was nixed, allegedly by one of the Mariners'
owners, Microsoft executive Greg Larson, who owns 30 percent of the
club, which is 4-14 the deal was killed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst part is that (Larson) doesn't realize what it does
to us,'' Ken Griffey Jr. said. ``It leaves us all in a situation
that no matter how Randy pitches, if he pitches well or doesn't,
there's still a chance he'll be traded. The uncertainty is bad for
our team.''
</P>
<P>
   The mental side of baseball is a fragile aspect of the game that
is rarely talked about, but it plays a tremendous part.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game is all frame of mind,'' Oakland right fielder Rickey
Henderson said. ``Any time you let the game get into your mind,
you're going to get into trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's head is messed up right now, the direct result of the
front office's game of yo-yo with him. It's no wonder Johnson is
6-6 with a 5.17 ERA, numbers well below the standards he has set in
the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy's trying, but it's tough,'' Griffey said. ``It's tough
on the team, not knowing. It hurts the focus. It's not that we're
flat. It's like we're playing with something on everyone's mind.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Anything to escape &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Florida has had mild interest from other clubs concerning third
baseman Todd Zeile, the other part of the Mike Piazza deal that
sent Gary Sheffield, Charles Johnson and Bobby Bonilla to Los
Angeles last month.
</P>
<P>
   So Zeile has taken it upon himself to help his cause in trying
to escape the Marlins' sorry situation. Zeile is brushing up on his
old catching skills, which he believes could help speed a trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't make a whole lot of sense for me to make the move
(to catcher) right now,'' said Zeile, 32. ``But if someone wanted
to make a commitment to me, it's certainly a possibility. I haven't
caught in a while, so my legs are fresher than somebody my age. I'm
sure I could do it. . . . I miss some parts of catching, calling a
game and working with pitchers.''
</P>
<P>
   Zeile, a catcher throughout college, the minors and his first
two seasons in the majors with St. Louis, is being paid $3.2
million this season and is guaranteed $3.3 million next year. He
recently caught Livan Hernandez during a bullpen session and said
Baltimore and another club have inquired about his ability to
switch back to catching. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Precursor to the Series? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The two best clubs in baseball, the New York Yankees and
Atlanta, are scheduled to play four games against each other this
week, two in each city.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to play the Yankees for one reason: for revenge, the
payback,'' Atlanta catcher Javier Lopez said.
</P>
<P>
   Braves third baseman Chipper Jones said: ``Everybody's making a
lot out of that series. You know, it's just four games in the
middle of June. It doesn't really mean anything. Maybe it will be a
preview of the World Series. Maybe neither one of us will get
there. You don't know, in the grand scheme of things.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Numero Uno? &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Martinez and Juan Marichal exchanged words recently over
who is the best Latin American-born pitcher. Two weeks ago,
Martinez tied Marichal with 243 career victories. Marichal, along
with Dave Stewart the best pitchers never to win a Cy Young Award,
was perturbed after Martinez said he was the best pitcher born in a
Latin country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to get into an argument about this,'' the
Dominican-born Marichal said. ``But a writer from Venezuela asked
me a question about something (Martinez) said in some article in
Nicaragua. He said he was the best Latin pitcher. I responded by
saying that if he thinks he's the best, I respect his beliefs. But
if you want to see the best, compare the numbers. If you compare
the numbers and if you know baseball, you can judge for yourself.
That's all I said.''
</P>
<P>
   Marichal is correct, of course. During his 16-year career,
Marichal was 243-142 with a 2.89 ERA. He won 20 games six times.
Martinez, born in Nicaragua, is 243-190 with a 3.68 ERA in his 22nd
season. He never has won 20 games in a season but did become the
second over-40 pitcher to record a save for the Braves last week,
joining Hoyt Wilhelm. &QL;

RAYS BEAT RED SOX
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By Gordon Edes 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. _ Life was anything but a beach Saturday
night for the fun-in-the-sun Red Sox, who finally fell off the wave
they've been riding, 8-5, to the expansion Tampa Bay Devil Rays,
who treated Bret Saberhagen's changeup like they were hitting off a
tee.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox lost not only the game, ending a four-game winning
streak before a crowd of 41,169 in Tropicana Field, but also the
argument, as manager Jimy Williams was ejected despite having what
appeared to be a legitimate (sounds like beach).
</P>
<P>
   Williams was tossed for the second time in 17 days, giving him
one more ejection than he had all of last season, after plate
umpire Rich Garcia reversed his call in the fifth inning and ruled
that Quinton McCracken had been hit by a Saberhagen pitch with two
Devil Rays already on base.
</P>
<P>
   All three baserunners scored after Dave Martinez scorched a
two-run double off Saberhagen, who has lost his last two starts
after winning three in a row, and Wade Boggs followed with a
sacrifice fly off rookie Brian Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia changed his mind after consulting third-base umpire John
Hirschbeck at the request of Greg Riddoch, the Devil Rays'
third-base coach, who told Garcia that he heard the pitch hit
McCracken.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in the ballpark knew it hit the guy except me,''
Garcia said. ``So I got help from one of my partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The third-base coach very politely asked me if I'd heard it
because he had. I thought, `My God, if it was that obvious, I'd
better ask one of my guys.' Obviously if he heard it, John must
have heard it, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Out of the Red Sox dugout popped Williams, who sandwiched
himself between Garcia and Hirschbeck while posing, in language
that became increasingly pungent the longer the argument went on,
this question: How could Hirschbeck, standing 120 feet away, be in
a better position than plate umpire Garcia to hear a ball striking
a batsman?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a third-base umpire make that call because he
heard it,'' said Williams, who added that he has never even seen a
plate umpire ask for help from a base umpire in that situation,
though Garcia claims he has done it before.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were 41,000 people, under a roof in a dome where the
sound isn't going anyplace,'' Williams said. ``This is not the US
Open, where a guy is putting on the 18th green. This isn't
Wimbledon, where somebody holds up a sign saying, `Quiet, please.'
The bottom line is it's disappointing that he would make a call
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever explanation Garcia offered did not satisfy Williams,
who followed the umpire back down the third-base line, barking all
the way. Even after Garcia tossed him, Williams kept up what had
become a one-sided debate. ``That's bad umpiring,'' Williams could
be seen saying at one point, pointing to his ear.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said he tried to add some levity to the argument in hopes
of making Williams go away. ``I told him the reason I didn't hear
it is I'm 56 years old and my hearing is gone,'' said Garcia, chief
of this crew. ``Jimy said, `I'm 54 and I didn't hear it.' I said,
`Perfect. You're over 53, and you don't hear, either.'''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was not amused, either at the time or afterward.
``(Hirschbeck) was down behind third base, at least 120 feet
away,'' he said. ``Even if you did hear something, how would you
know what it was? You can't call it from there.''
</P>
<P>
   And Williams grew even more furious when Garcia, in the
manager's presence, turned to Sox catcher Scott Hatteberg and asked
him what he thought. ``He shouldn't be talking to my catcher,''
said Williams.
</P>
<P>
   To the ultimate question _ did the pitch hit McCracken? _ Mo
Vaughn offered an unbiased opinion. ``The correction was the right
call,'' he said. ``Quinton McCracken is not going to lie. He's a
young dude, trying to swing and drive runs in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Jimy was arguing the call. I think he was
arguing the change of call. He put some spark in our dugout.''
</P>
<P>
   Down, 6-1, to the Devil Rays, the Red Sox drew to within a run
on Vaughn's 21st home run and Lou Merloni's RBI single in the
sixth, and two hits and a two-run error committed by Tampa Bay
second baseman Miguel Cairo on Vaughn's hard shot in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   But the Devil Rays, losers of their first four meetings against
the Red Sox, rallied for two runs in the bottom of the inning
against Barkley and Jim Corsi, who gave up a two-run ground single
to catcher John Flaherty, fresh off the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   The loss, which dropped Saberhagen's record to 8-5, was only the
third in the Sox' last dozen games. Saberhagen bolted from the
clubhouse afterward, not wishing to discuss damage wreaked by
Cairo's triple and Kevin Stocker's sacrifice fly in the second,
Paul Sorrento's two-run homer in the fourth, and Martinez's two-run
dagger in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was not the situation where the game was won or lost,''
Vaughn said, referring to the McCracken Affair. ``We clawed our way
back in there, but then some things happened that we can't let
happen tomorrow.''

SPECIAL PERSPECTIVE ON GAMES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By Bob Ryan 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We have all been made aware that one of our rich local athletes
is in a classic ``play-me-or-trade-me'' mode. He should be made
aware that there are people in the world with real problems, and
that it would be better were he simply to shut up and play when
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Better yet, he should be sent home immediately. He should then
be dispatched to Cambridge, where he can take a look at a different
type of athlete. He might come away better equipped to deal with
his own life issues.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to imply that the Special Olympics are any kind of
somber experience. Au contraire. The Massachusetts Special
Olympics, which are being held this weekend at MIT, happens to be
one of the great uplifting experiences anyone can have. I mean, if
it's smiling faces you want to see, the Special Olympics is the
place to see them.
</P>
<P>
   It's a variation of the famed Grantland Rice idea that the
important thing is how you played the game. In this case, the
important thing is that you played the game. For many of the
athletes, participation truly is enough to make them happy.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, some of the participants do care more about winning
than others. There are some very spirited competitions. But that is
never the point. As the PA announcer said during the morning track
competition, ``It is OK to cheer for every athlete out there _ just
a reminder.''
</P>
<P>
   You can meet some extraordinary people. Take Michael McAdams,
for example. He has been participating in Special Olympic
competitions since 1987. He was there to run in both the 100 meters
and 400 meters Saturday, but during his time he has earned medals
in basketball, soccer, volleyball, the long jump, and shot put.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got 185 medals,'' he beamed. ``They're all home, in
boxes.''
</P>
<P>
   When most of us think of the Special Olympics, we tend to
conjure up a picture of people running, jumping, or throwing an
object. Track and field is the glamour sport of the event, no
doubt. But there is a lot more going on right now than track and
field.
</P>
<P>
   There is tenpin bowling going on in Dorchester. There is sailing
competition in Charlestown. And there is tennis at MIT.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're one of the smaller competitions,'' explains Sylvia
Swartz, who has brought 14 athletes from Handi-Racket, which plays
out of the Longfellow Club in Weymouth. ``We're almost like a
little subculture over here.''
</P>
<P>
   I got to see most of a doubles match. Dan Widrich and Rich
Miller prevailed over David Broden and Meg Schilling in a match
that included some nice rallies and some particularly agile
retrieves by Miller, a Special Olympics veteran who admitted to
being a somewhat reluctant participant since he considers himself
more of a coach than an athlete these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Soccer is actually my favorite sport,'' he says. ``It's fun to
watch them kick that ball and then jump up and down when they
score.''
</P>
<P>
   The tennis players are particularly excited because four of them
will be nominated to participate in the 1999 World Games, which
will be held next summer in North Carolina. But most of the
participants don't need that carrot in order to enjoy themselves
here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in Handi-Racket for eight years,'' says Rayna
Segelman, who may not have full use of her right hand, but who has
complete command of the English language. ``It's one of the best
things I've ever done in my whole life. You always try the best you
can, but the fact is that every person who participates is a
winner.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, the skies opened up a bit and it seemed to make sense
to get in out of the rain. That took me inside the hockey rink, and
into the roller skating competition.
</P>
<P>
   Now here were some people who were justly proud of their
accomplishments. A young lady named Patty Pitts did something of a
header, but that was OK. Remember the Bing Crosby line in ``Well,
Did You Evah?'' She's a game girl, you know. Got up and finished
fourth. Patty did better than that. She's a game girl who got up
and finished second. You'd have liked the smile on her face when
she received her silver medal.
</P>
<P>
   And speaking of smiles, Peter Richards had a grin as wide as a
football field every time he passed in front of his family when he
skated around the floor. He was pretty psyched when he got his
silver medal, too.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki Movsessian was on hand to give out medals, and if the name
sounds familiar, it's because she was a member of the gold
medal-winning women's hockey team in Nagano.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to come here to see the excitement and the
sportsmanship,'' Movsessian said. ``We can all learn so much from
them. I think it's important to recognize all athletes, regardless
of the abilities or disabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   She brought along her gold medal.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's the sense of keeping it hidden?'' she said. ``It's
something that represents the team, family, and the United States
of America. Why not share it?''
</P>
<P>
   The Special Olympics are a huge undertaking, but everything was
humming along nicely Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very pleased,'' said Tony Carnevale of the public
relations staff. ``We had close to 750 volunteers sign up, and we
must have had another 750 show up on top of that. And we can always
use them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Special Olympics can really get in someone's blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the volunteers was telling me that on Sunday he is
bringing his wife and two small children here as a Father's Day
activity,'' Carnevale explained. ``He said that he wanted his
children to see, while they are young, that there are some people
in the world who are different. He thought that would be a great
way to spend Father's Day.''
</P>
<P>
   I know this much: There is no way you can put a price tag on one
of those smiles.

LONG RIDE FOR BAHRES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By Michael Vega 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUDON, N.H. _ Sunday, Bob Bahre and his only son, Gary, will
spend Father's Day much the way they spend the other 364 days of
the year. They will be at their track at New Hampshire
International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully my dad already knows this, but everything I've got
is a result of what he's done for me,'' said Gary, 35, who is
part-owner and president of NHIS. ``I can tell you that even if I
didn't have anything, I've got the best dad in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob, the 71-year-old patriarch of NHIS, says none of it would
have been possible without his son. But he doesn't figure on
retiring any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't retire,'' he said with a cackle. ``I retire every
night, but I have to get up every morning to go to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Gary is constantly reminding his father to take it easy.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the time,'' said Gary. ``I'm always telling him that I'd
like to do different things with him. You should come up to Maine
sometime to see his collection of cars. He's got Packards,
Dusenbergs. They're beautiful and he loves them. But one of the
best times he and I ever had together was on a whirlwind trip we
took together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about 15 years ago,'' Bob recalled. ``We got on a plane
and went to Milwaukee and we went to Oklahoma and we went to
Kansas, looking at cars. We finally ended up buying a Packard from
this guy in Oklahoma.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a father-son bonding experience, and they are partners
now in another joint venture, NHIS. Sometimes they agree. Sometimes
they don't. But they always talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least twice a day,'' Bob said. ``I talk with Gary in the
morning, then we'll talk again at night.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Sunday?
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll spend it at the track, just like we've always spent
Father's Day,'' Bob said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we always will,'' chimed in Gary.
</P>
<P>
   Focal point
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, it was dissent between Dale Earnhardt and crew chief
Larry McReynolds that led Winston Cup car owner Richard Childress
to shake up his underachieving teams two weeks ago. Childress made
a swap in crew chiefs, switching McReynolds from Earnhardt's No. 3
Goodwrench Chevrolet to Mike Skinner's No. 31 Lowe's Chevy. Kevin
Hamlin is now Earnhardt's crew chief, bringing an end to the
18-month relationship between Earnhardt and McReynolds, who charged
last week that the seven-time Winston Cup champ has suffered from a
lack of focus. ``Talentwise Dale's still there, but the competition
has certainly caught up,'' McReynolds told Sports Illustrated.
``The days of showing up at a track on Friday, then hightailing it
out of there after the race on Sunday _ without even talking about
what the car was doing, and then maybe driver and crew chief
talking to each other once during the week _ and showing up at the
next racetrack the next Friday, those days are gone.'' Earnhardt
has had his share of distractions. He and his wife have started a
Winston Cup team. He has fielded a Busch Grand National car driven
by his son, Dale Earnhardt Jr. And he has many appearance and
sponsor obligations ... In last week's Miller Lite 400 at Michigan
Speedway, NASCAR officials had to contend with controversy. Leader
Jeff Gordon contended that someone threw a piece of debris onto the
track, prompting a caution period that interrupted his unbridled
gallop. Mark Martin wound up winning, his fourth victory of the
season, to move into third place in the Winston Cup point
standings. The debris was a piece of roll bar padding that NASCAR
officials were unable to match up with a car, leaving them baffled
as to how it wound up on the track. ``We have evaluated all of the
videotapes, and the evidence is inconclusive as far as how the
debris got on the racetrack,'' said Gary Nelson, NASCAR Winston Cup
director. ``While we consider the situation suspicious, there is no
conclusive evidence as to how it occurred. NASCAR's view of a
caution flag is to warn drivers of potential hazards. Obviously,
roll bar padding is not a hazard, but we don't know that until we
go and pick it up.'' ... Jeremy Mayfield, despite being winless
this season, &UR;  &LR; remained atop the Winston Cup standings with a
26-point lead over Gordon (2,023 to 1,997) after finishing fifth at
Michigan. ``We're not pushing the `winning thing,' at least not
mentally,'' said Mayfield. ``Don't get me wrong. We want to win. We
want to win bad, but we're willing to be patient, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracy fires back
</P>
<P>
   FedEx CART driver  &UR; Paul Tracy  &LR; will be on probation when he
starts  &UR; today &LR; 's Budweiser/G.I. Joe's 200 at Portland, Ore. CART
officials cited Tracy for a run-in with  &UR; Christian Fittipaldi  &LR; at
the ITT Automotive Detroit Grand Prix. Tracy responded with an
angry missive, citing other incidents that went unpunished. ``If I
am to be placed on probation for attempting to pass a car at 35
miles per hour in Detroit,'' Tracy wrote, ``why was no action taken
when Christian more or less forced me into the wall while trying to
overtake me at Long Beach (repeating the equally unsuccessful
maneuver he tried with  &UR; Greg Moore  &LR; in 1996)? Or when  &UR; Gil de
Ferran  &LR; hit my rear wheel with his front wheel at Rio? Or, for that
matter, when  &UR; Max Papis  &LR; hit  &UR; Arnd Meier  &LR; at Gateway? Or when
 &UR; Patrick Carpentier  &LR; pinched down on  &UR; Michael Andretti  &LR; at
Milwaukee? I cite these incidents not because I believe that two,
three, or four wrongs make a right, but because I think CART should
treat every wrong equally.'' ... Rain wreaked havoc at area tracks
last week. New Thompson (Conn.) Speedway rescheduled the Shaw's 300
for Labor Day weekend, and Saturday night's program at Oxford
Plains (Maine) Speedway was postponed and not immediately
rescheduled.

DRAFT PREVIEW
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By Peter May 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   He is rapidly becoming the ``must have'' of the 1998 NBA draft.
Considering that many hoop fans never even heard of him a year ago,
well, it says that Michael Olowokandi has come a very long way in a
very short time.
</P>
<P>
   He's testament to two NBA articles of faith: (1) You can't coach
height and (2) centers are hard to find. NBA scouts are ignoring
Olowokandi's limited college career (77 games) and lack of tough
competition (he went to Pacific) and are spinning things to the
upside: He didn't start playing seriously until college, and the
unvarnished prospect (he played recreationally in Europe) has not
gotten spoiled by hangers-on and anti-fundamentalists. He has
excellent footwork and agility, thanks in part to years of playing
soccer.
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi was born in Nigeria and attended high school in
England, at Newlands Manor, which we don't think is the St.
Anthony's of the British Isles. His one year in college in England
was spent at an institution _ Brunel University in Uxbridge,
Middlesex _ that did not have an athletic program.
</P>
<P>
   He decided on the University of the Pacific by choosing it out
of a phone directory. He wanted a school by the ocean. Pacific is
about as close as UNLV is to the Pacific Ocean. It's like Humphrey
Bogart's great line from ``Casablanca'' after he tells Claude Rains
that he came to Casablanca for the water. Told that Casablanca is
in the desert, Bogart says, ``I was misinformed.''
</P>
<P>
   In three years at Pacific, Olowokandi has gone from rudimentary
to stiff to certified 20-10 guy in the NBA. He won't go lower than
second and it's another testament to his size, ability, and
potential that Vancouver, picking second, doesn't feel it can let
him pass even though the Grizzlies have $65 million committed to
Bryant ``Big Country'' Reeves. They would have to move Olowokandi
(or Reeves), but they realize his inherent value and can't let him
go by.
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi has size (7 feet 1 inch), strength (265 pounds),
speed (4.5 in the 40), and is still young to the game. That means
he still finds it fun, still has room to grow, and doesn't think a
cell phone is as important as a jump shot. He averaged 22.2 points,
11.2 rebounds, and 2.9 blocks for Pacific last season and has
thoroughly impressed everyone with his workouts and interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a heck of a prospect,'' said Grizzlies coach Brian Hill.
``He may not do it right away, but in two or three years, he may be
pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Golden State general manager Garry St. Jean, whose team
has no shot at Olowokandi unless it trades up, ``We didn't really
work him out. We played H-O-R-S-E with him and talked to him. He's
also a great kid.''
</P>
<P>
   The only unknown is whether the Clippers, picking first, will
pass on Olowokandi, which would be true to their history. The
Grizzlies won't. As Hill put it, ``If we're sitting at 2 and
Olowokandi is available, I think a lot of people are going to be
knocking at our door. If it's Mike Bibby, I don't think we'll get
as many people knocking.''
</P>
<P>
   Olowokandi and Bibby (whom David Falk apparently is not allowing
to work out anywhere but Los Angeles) are 1-2 or 2-1 or 1-1A on
everyone's list. After that is where the fun starts. The next six
players are almost certain to be Paul Pierce, Vince Carter, Robert
Traylor, Larry Hughes, Raef LaFrentz, and Antawn Jamison. They
could go anywhere. After that, it's a guessing game. The Bucks, who
draft ninth and 19th, had 38 players in for workouts. There are two
high school kids, Rashard Lewis and Al Harrington, who could go in
the first round. There are no UCLA kids who could go in the first
round.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a list of the teams drafting and their needs. New
Jersey, Miami, New York, Washington, Phoenix, Portland, and
Cleveland have no first-round picks, while two teams, Orlando and
Houston, each have three.
</P>
<P>
   LA CLIPPERS (1, 22): They need everything but a small forward
and will need that if they move Maurice Taylor, arguably their best
player. The latest rumor has the Clippers trying to get both the
first and second picks, using their roster as an alleged
enticement. Bear in mind that this team has never re-signed any of
its own quality free agents (Loy Vaught was extended), and Ike
Austin may be the latest to bolt.
</P>
<P>
   VANCOUVER (2): Hill says, ``We can use anything other than a
small forward or a center.'' The Grizzlies are getting bombarded
with offers and can afford to select like an epicurean at a
four-star restaurant. They did bring in LaFrentz for a second
workout (always a clue) and may work out a deal with Toronto that
brings them the fourth pick and a body (Doug Christie?). We also
hear Steve Nash's name here, although it would seem that the
Grizzlies would demand more than that for the pick.
</P>
<P>
   DENVER (3, 23): You win 11 games, you need the best of
everything. They'd love Olowokandi, but whom do they have that
anyone wants? Oh yes, and they don't have a coach, either. (Neither
do the Clips.) Any of the available select six would help here.
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO (4): They had three firsts. Now they have one. Prior to
acquiring Kevin Willis (and what was that all about, by the way?)
they had to be looking big. But with Willis and Marcus Camby still
there, they may think smaller.
</P>
<P>
   GOLDEN STATE (5): What an awful roster. And most of the best
players are free agents. They're getting lots of calls about Mr.
Warmth, Latrell Sprewell. They'll go with one of the perimeter
players to help their vaunted front line anchored by Erick Dampier
and backed up by Bill Walton clone Todd Fuller.
</P>
<P>
   DALLAS (6): Their starting backcourt is Hubert Davis and Khalid
Reeves. Need you know more? Cedric Ceballos is also a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO (7): Would they dare deal Chris Webber? GM Geoff
Petrie is trying to fight the good fight for the marginal
franchise, but he may have no other option. This team needs
backcourt help. Mitch Richmond is gone, as is Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf
(Turkey).
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (8): Theo Ratliff and Joe Smith are free agents and
Derrick Coleman could be bought out. All signs point to big,
although a guard who could coexist with Allen Iverson wouldn't
hurt, either.
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE (9, 19): The Bucks have no free agents of note and a
pretty sizable hole in the middle. It's hard to think they will
fill it here, although Ute Mike Doleac would be a natural.
Supposedly, they're also discreetly shopping Terrell Brandon, which
may or may not affect one of their picks.
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON (10): Rick Pitino says he wants scoring, size, maturity,
and a starter. That means someone better than Andrew DeClercq (a
frightening thought) or Walter McCarty. He's looking to move up;
he'd love a crack at LaFrentz.
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT (11): The Pistons should be looking big, given their
unhappiness with Brian Williams. One has to assume they'll re-sign
Jerry Stackhouse. Who else wants a slasher who can't finish and a
scorer who can't shoot?
</P>
<P>
   ORLANDO (12, 13, 15): The Magic can fill positions; will they
fill their needs? They can get a point guard (Jason Williams), a
power forward with at least one major flaw, and maybe take a flyer
on a foreigner at center. Penny will then evaluate the picks.
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON (14, 16, 18): Three picks in the teens is like getting
Herbert Hoover, Rutherford B. Hayes, and William Henry Harrison in
a ``Best of the Presidents'' contest. The Rockets actually sound
excited at having them, however. Maybe Rudy T can find them on
whatever team he takes to Athens. Again, a chance to fill
positions, one of them possibly being the first high schooler,
local favorite Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA (17): The Wolves said goodbye to Stanley Roberts,
which, given their precarious center position, tells you a lot
about Stanley Roberts. If they want to go big here, their only
possibility is a foreigner with a contract hangup. And, as Stan
Kasten once noted prophetically (see Celtics v. Jugoplastika,
Celtics v. Il Messaggero), ``International is synonymous with
trouble.'' They still could use help up front, especially with Tom
Gugliotta's status uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA (20): They need a new set of alibis for Lenny Wilkens.
He may need them. The small forward hole is still there, and two
key frontliners, Alan Henderson and Christian Laettner, are free
agents. Henderson will get a lot of interest.
</P>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE (21): Both centers are free agents. How did that
happen? Again, no hope in that department unless they re-sign one.
George Shinn is fast turning into the Donald Sterling of the East.
</P>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO (24): Calling all shooters! With Tim Duncan and
David Robinson (apparently) set for the next couple years, the
Spurs desperately need someone to balance the books on offense. If
Bryce Drew is available, they'll probably go for him. It doesn't
help, we think, that two of the three players in their
spectacularly humdrum backcourt (Vinny Del Negro and Jaren Jackson)
are free agents.
</P>
<P>
   INDIANA (25): Boy, they sure got a lot out of Austin Croshere,
didn't they? The Bulls capitalized on Indiana's one demonstrable
weakness _ athleticism _ and the Pacers need to get someone who can
cover the floor. Someone like Corey Benjamin would be ideal, but
he's likely to be gone by then.
</P>
<P>
   LA LAKERS (26): Jerry West will drive Nick Van Exel to the
airport if need be. West also likes to take point guards, and this
may yet be another time, though maybe not the one we think he'll
take. The Lakers have had luck with late picks and West knows
talent. But talent isn't what this team needs. It has plenty of
that.
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE (27): We're throwing darts now. There might not be
anyone left who can even make the team, let alone be of any help.
The same holds true for Utah and, possibly, Chicago, depending on
what happens. This might be the place to draft a foreigner, a raw
kid with some potential, and wait, or simply pass and refuse to
guarantee three years to what the late, great John Killilea used to
call a ``K.P.'' (Kan't Play).
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO (28): You can be sure Jerry Krause has some obscure guy
in mind who will be a terrific player. He always does. The
difference this time around is that the guy may not have to be
wearing a suit come playoff time because there's either not going
to be a postseason in Chicago (NBC's worst nightmare) or the Bulls
will be so mediocre they'll need the guy.
</P>
<P>
   UTAH (29): The Jazz face the daunting task of preparing for life
without Chris Morris. How do they handle that? Scotty Layden has
made some terrific second-round picks (Shandon Anderson, Bryon
Russell), and this might as well be the second round. He also may
go international given that there are no real holes in his team.

BONILLA HOSPITALIZED, PUT ON DL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Bobby Bonilla, already sidelined by a tender left wrist
and left Achilles tendon, was placed on the 15-day disabled list,
retroactive to Wednesday, after being hospitalized Friday night
with an intestinal infection.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla, expected to remain in a Denver-area hospital until
Monday, also is suffering from dehydration. He first came down with
flu-like symptoms two weekends ago, during the series in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   He returned after two games but remained weak, batting just four
times without a hit in the Dodgers' series in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Bill Russell has been concerned by Bonilla's lack of pop
since joining the club. Bonilla is batting .175 in 27 games since
he was acquired May 15 from the Florida Marlins. He hit a home run
in his first game as a Dodger but none since. He had 97 RBI last
year for the Marlins.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just hasn't been the same guy we know he can be,'' Russell
said. ``With all that is going on with him, this was the only move
to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking Bonilla's place on the roster is Triple-A left-hander
Will Brunson, 28, who was 4-4 with a 4.75 ERA with Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   Luke returns: Matt Luke received a warm reception from teammates
when he rejoined the Dodgers before Saturday's game. Luke, who
played two months with the Dodgers before being designated for
assignment May 29, spent two weeks with Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   When the Indians designated Luke for assignment June 15, the
Dodgers purchased his contract. He pinch hit for Jim Bruske in the
seventh inning, singled and scored on Eric Karros' bases-loaded
double. In 33 games with the Dodgers, Luke batted .286 with seven
doubles, three homers and 11 RBI. He was 0 for 2 with the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a pretty strange few weeks, to say the least,''
Luke said. ``I went home (Laguna Beach) for a day before getting
here. The Indians let me take batting practice with them for a
couple of days, so I have been working out. But I need to get those
at-bats.''
</P>
<P>
   Friendly fire: Rockies third baseman Vinny Castilla and Dodgers
reliever Antonio Osuna are friends during the offseason in Mexico.
But Castilla was only half-kidding when he said Saturday he thought
Osuna showed him up Friday night after striking him out to end the
game. Osuna threw a fist in the air and gestured Castilla back to
the Rockies' dugout.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went too far,'' Castilla said. ``Maybe next time if I get
him, I will go too far.''
</P>
<P>
   People's choice: Colorado's Larry Walker, on the DL with a sore
right elbow, isn't sure he should be a starting outfielder in the
July 7 All-Star Game at Coors Field. He leads Moises Alou by about
240,000 votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said people get voted into the All-Star Game who
probably don't deserve to be there, and other guys get snubbed
out,'' said Walker, who can be activated July 3. ``It looks like
that's going to happen to me this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker is batting .336, but the elbow has robbed him of his
power. He has only nine homers and 33 RBI. Alou is hitting .340
with 58 RBI, and Sammy Sosa is hitting .333 with 29 home runs and
72 RBI. ``Some guys are going to get screwed,'' Walker said. ``I
might be the cause of that.''

LEHMAN MAKES HIS MOVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Ho hum, another U.S. Open, another final-day,
final-group pairing. For Tom Lehman it's getting to be as
predictable as the contents of all those long, wrapped, rectangular
boxes that so many dear old dads will be tearing open today.
</P>
<P>
   A tie for Father's Day? If you're Lehman, you're thinking:
Please, no, not another one like the tie for second in 1996. And,
for that matter, no more solo third-place finishes, either, like in
1995 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman has gone into the final round of the U.S. Open with the
lead each of the last three years and lost. He has seen one of the
four greatest gifts in professional golf slip through his fingers.
The title eluded him by three shots in 1995, by one shot in 1996
and by two shots last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal (today) is not to beat myself,'' said Lehman, who, for
a change, has something to chase down the stretch other than his
own demons.
</P>
<P>
   The snakebit 1996 British Open champion heads into today's final
round tied for second with Bob Tway after equaling the low score of
the third round Saturday with a 2-under-par 68.
</P>
<P>
   This time the pole position and all the pressure belong to
Lehman's playing partner Payne Stewart. He opened Saturday with an
eagle-3, closed it with three straight pars and in between took
whatever the Olympic Club's stingy Lake Course would give him to
tack on a 70 to his earlier rounds of 66 and 71. His 54-hole total
of 207 is four better than Lehman and Tway, who shot a 73.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Price followed a second-round 68 with a 71 to stand tied
for fourth with Lee Janzen (73). It made for some leaderboard as
all four of the players directly behind Stewart _ Lehman, Tway,
Price and Janzen _ have won a major.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's Jim Furyk, who has come oh-so-close to winning his
first Grand Slam title, finishing no worse than sixth in the past
four majors. He carded a 68, same as Lehman, and is eight shots
back, at 215.
</P>
<P>
   Like Lehman, Stewart is treading in familiar territory. He led
after three rounds of the 1991 U.S. Open at Hazeltine National Golf
Club in Lehman's home state of Minnesota. The experience ended well
for Stewart, albeit belatedly, as he defeated Scott Simpson in a
Monday playoff.
</P>
<P>
   Since lassoing his first-and-only major, Stewart, 41, has won
only once on the PGA Tour (the 1995 Houston Open). He is the first
to admit his priorities have changed over the past few years, with
family supplanting golf as his abiding passion.
</P>
<P>
   He has trimmed his tournament schedule to make time for his two
children, Chelsea, 12, and Aaron, 9. Stewart wants to be there for
them, as much as he can, just as his late father was for him.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Stewart was a good enough golfer to compete as an amateur
in the 1955 U.S. Open on the same Olympic Club course Stewart has,
to this point, hog-tied. The elder Stewart didn't fare nearly as
well, shooting rounds of 83 and 88 to miss the cut.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, as Bee Stewart felt compelled to point out to her son
Saturday, the rough 43 years ago was knee-high, instead of ankle
deep. Given that Stewart missed seven of 14 fairways Saturday, he
should give thanks for small blessings.
</P>
<P>
   While he is at it, Stewart should kiss his putter; aside from
the most-replayed putt of the tournament (his 3-putt on the
diabolical 18th Friday), Stewart has been able to conquer all the
greens in two strokes or less.
</P>
<P>
   He vowed to play the course the same way today as he has all
week. He'll leave the prevent defense to his beloved Dallas Cowboys
and aim for the flag, but only when there's a clear opening. That
was the case on No. 1 when he hit a driver off the tee, a 5-iron
second shot to 20 feet and made the putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I think that I've played these first three rounds using
smoke and mirrors, I'm kidding myself,'' Stewart said. ``There's no
reason to not think I'm going to come out and play good golf
(today). If I come out and let the situation intimidate me, then
that's my fault.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman has beat himself up over his near misses some, but not
much. He, more than most, has a firm grasp of what's really
important, which is why he could be found after his round on the
practice range, stopping between swings to watch his 8-year-old
daughter Rachael hit golf balls with his 5-iron.
</P>
<P>
   Later Saturday night Lehman, who was an assistant pro at Wood
Ranch when he played in the 1987 Open here, planned to take in a
movie with his wife Melissa and their three children. In case
you're curious, it wasn't ``Groundhog Day.''

GONZALEZ SETTING A HEALTHY PACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ In the posh new visitors' clubhouse at Edison Field, a
side door leads to a well-appointed gym. In there, among other
fitness equipment, is a bench-press rack with 45-pound disks, a
curling bar, some enormous dumbbells and the requisite mirror
covering an entire wall.
</P>
<P>
   (For some strange reason, all of this lies just beyond one table
laden with doughnuts and another heaped with a decadent array of
candy.)
</P>
<P>
   When the Texas Rangers hit town this weekend, several players
puffed and sweated in the room in the mid-afternoon, but Juan
Gonzalez, breaking from one-time routine, wouldn't step near it. He
remained at his locker, lifting nothing more than the corners of
his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was working so hard before with heavy weights,'' the
Rangers' slugging right fielder said of his recent past. ``I had a
lot of injuries, a lot of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   That smile broadened. ``But now I feel great. I feel more
flexibility in my body. I feel more strong. More velocity _ speed.
I feel more comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   For Gonzalez, one of the most powerful hitters in baseball, the
word ``projection'' used to be akin to ``cruel joke.'' He would
take off on a pace that would project to record numbers in RBI or
home runs, but then his muscles and connecting tissue would begin
to rip apart, so overbuilt was his body.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, he hired as a personal, 12-month trainer a
fitness guru from the Dominican Republic, Angel Precinal, who has
studied elite-athlete training techniques in Cuba and in Europe.
``I am exercising,'' said Gonzalez, ``like track and field.''
</P>
<P>
   And not breaking down. The projections, as a direct result,
are... well, not Ruthian, perhaps, but at least Wilsonian.
</P>
<P>
   Texas has played 73 games this season and Gonzalez has appeared
in each and every one of them, along the way rifling bullets to all
fields and driving in 88 runs, a major-league lead that even Mark
McGwire can't touch. If Gonzalez can maintain that pace for 158
games this year, he would break a major-league RBI record that has
stood for 68 years _ since Hack Wilson of the Chicago Cubs drove in
190 in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   (ITAL)If.(END ITAL)
</P>
<P>
   In the past, any such bid was always foiled by a lengthy absence
to injury. Gonzalez has not reached the 135-game mark in any of his
last four seasons. Why, even when he won the American League Most
Valuable Player award in 1996 he missed 28 games because of injury
_ which is an indication of just how thoroughly he can savage
pitching when he is sound.
</P>
<P>
   The maladies were the type that screamed out for increased
flexibility _ torn quadriceps, herniated disk in his back, strained
groin, torn cartilage in his knee, torn ligament in his thumb.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always hurt because he was too bulky,'' said teammate
Luis Alicea, the former Angels infielder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Six or seven years ago, there was a tendency in baseball for a
lot of players to do body-building,'' added Luis Mayoral, a
Spanish-language broadcaster for the Rangers. ``(Jose) Canseco did
it. Ruben Sierra did it. That was the tendency, at least among the
Hispanics _ to be Adonis, to have the great body. But having the
great body doesn't necessarily mean you're going to perform as a
baseball player.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't assume, however, that Gonzalez now spends his spare time
visiting one of those snack tables in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``People see Juan playing every night, putting up the big
numbers,'' said Texas' Roberto Kelly, the former Dodgers
outfielder. ``They don't realize that he gets up in the morning
after putting in a long night and goes to the gym and works out. I
know it because I work out with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as much work as before, but with a vastly different
emphasis: stretching and light weights.
</P>
<P>
   The regimen neatly complements Gonzalez's style as a hitter.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire attracts hordes when he takes batting practice, because
his hitting stroke is the type that takes the breath away _ dead
pull, uppercut, launching balls to the deepest reaches of the
left-field seats.
</P>
<P>
   When Gonzalez stepped into the cage before a game with the
Angels on Friday afternoon, it generated barely a ripple of
excitement. Here's why: His first 17 cuts produced hits up the
middle or to right field, with only one ball carrying the wall. Low
liners jumped off his bat and threatened to leave dents in the
right-center wall.
</P>
<P>
   Hardly sideshow stuff _ but something that would cause any
baseball purist to marvel.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of hours later, on a low-and-away fastball that the
Angels' Chuck Finley had appeared to spot perfectly, Gonzalez
lashed a double into the right-center gap that cleared the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers hitting coach Rudy Jaramillo, who managed a 16-year-old
Gonzalez in rookie ball 12 years ago, said, ``The thing I see about
Juan, (compared to) Ken Griffey or McGwire or Albert Belle or Frank
Thomas, Juan is the most prolific line-drive hitter I've ever seen.
Those guys sky theirs, and Juan drives his like a golf ball. That's
the difference. He hits line drives with power.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Gonzalez wants to hit with durability. And play and live
with ease.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the maturity is clearly evident in this former
mercurial and reckless young man. Being divorced three times by age
28 is sure to weather anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel relaxed when I play this game,'' he said. ``Before, I
had personal problems, a lot of injuries. But right now I don't
have injuries, I don't have personal problems. I'm a positive man,
ready to play every day. That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   As with McGwire and Roger Maris, Gonzalez has been made keenly
aware of the accomplishment of Wilson. It doesn't produce the
slightest flinch. ``The record is not easy, you know _ 191 is not
easy,'' Gonzalez said. ``But it's not impossible, too. The key is,
when I see men on base, having a lot of concentration to drive the
runs in.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of games remaining, a lot of baseball
remaining, and I'll see a lot of runners on base.''
</P>
<P>
   The words reflect the brimming optimism of a guy who has gone
nearly three months in a rigorous sport without missing a day's
work.

DAD'S PRICELESS GIFT WAS GIVING HIS TIME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ My father is a formidable figure, with a booming
voice and a personality that eclipses his 6-foot-2 frame. People
who meet him assume he once ran interference for a hotshot tailback
at some prestigious university. But World War II shot down my
father's college plans and his athletic career.
</P>
<P>
   That's not why my dad went to extraordinary ends to spring me,
his firstborn, for gains so great they're still being measured. He
wasn't living vicariously through my athletic endeavors, just
evening a score.
</P>
<P>
   His father had been largely indifferent to his sporting
pursuits. His disinterest was a sore on my father's childhood that
festered and left him scarred well into adulthood. He vowed early
on his children would grow up knowing unequivocally that he cared.
</P>
<P>
   So in the fall of 1972, when I announced swimming looked like a
lot of fun after watching Mark Spitz race to seven gold medals at
the Munich Olympics, my father moved almost as swiftly as Spitz
had.
</P>
<P>
   Little did he know, as he set out the next day for the Santa
Clara Swim Club, the life he was about to enrich (other than his
child's) was his own.
</P>
<P>
   When my father arrived at the pool after a 30-mile trek that was
to become as familiar to us as our driveway, he headed straight for
the club's world-renowned head coach George Haines. After
introducing himself, my father told Haines he had a 9-year-old
daughter who wished to join the team at once. ``Is she as big as
you?'' Haines asked hopefully.
</P>
<P>
   The truth was, I was laughably short and scrawny. But I had my
father's drive _ and both my parents' unflagging support _ and in
the first year I went from being a novice to a member of an
age-group relay team that was ranked No. 1 in the country.
</P>
<P>
   I would swim competitively for 11 more years and I can count on
one hand the number of swim meets my father missed until I moved
away to college. Win or lose, he was always there for me at the end
of the race, with a big hug (and, on occasion, a handkerchief to
wipe away the tears).
</P>
<P>
   My pursuit of excellence would cost my father hundreds of
Saturday golf games, countless fishing trips and one job promotion
(it entailed a move across the country that my father feared would
disrupt my progress in the pool).
</P>
<P>
   But what he gained was priceless: A bond with his daughter
that's the envy of all his golf-playing, pleasure-seeking,
corporate ladder-climbing cronies.
</P>
<P>
   Our relationship is the envy of my friends, too, many of whom
grew up with fathers who stayed well in the periphery of their
daily lives (indeed, there were many high school meets where mine
was the only father in the seats). Once they got over being
intimidated by the mere sight and sound of my father, my friends
soaked up his attention like dry skin does lotion.
</P>
<P>
   I, of course, basked in my father's company. Of all the things
we did together, I enjoyed our car rides the most. We spent hours
in the automobile, driving to and from swimming pools all over the
state.
</P>
<P>
   We passed the time talking about everything under the sun. No
subject was too trivial or terrible to broach. Our rapport was such
that I trusted my father's judgment explicitly.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I didn't argue when he told me on the way home from
swim practice one night that it was time to look for a new club. I
was 16 then and much older when I found out one of my coaches that
night had told my father I could go a long way with a little help
from certain chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   As usual my father had been looking out for me.
</P>
<P>
   When it came time to visiting colleges, it seemed perfectly
natural that my father ride shotgun. The night he left me in the
care of some swimmers at USC, my dad walked to a nearby restaurant
to grab a bite to eat. As he was walking back to his hotel, a
stranger appeared out of nowhere and blocked his path.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wanna buy a watch?'' the man asked my father, flashing open
his trench coat to reveal a knife. My father didn't flinch, then or
when I breathlessly cut off his greeting the next morning to start
in about how much I liked the school.
</P>
<P>
   I didn't hear the knife story until years later. I know it must
have scared my father terribly, the idea of his ``little girl''
moving 400 miles from home _ OK, from him _ to a place where
(ITAL)he(END ITAL) wasn't even safe in the streets.
</P>
<P>
   And yet he let me go, to find my own way, as he knew even the
most loving father must.
</P>
<P>
   I was out of sight but never out of his mind. My first year in
college, my father flew to L.A. to surprise me at our conference
swim meet at East L.A. College. The only problem was, he drove to
West L.A. College by mistake. Somehow he managed to find his way to
the right pool in time to catch my big race.
</P>
<P>
   My dad and I have a hundred such stories and every once in a
while we'll chuckle and say, ``Remember when ...'' Each story,
however different, invariably ends the same, with my father saying,
``you know, those were the best years of my life,'' and me
murmuring in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Devotion, thy name is Dad. For mine and every other one out
there like him, this day's for you.

BIG DAY FOR KUCHAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By Joe Concannon 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ This is Father's Day, and it is also Matt
Kuchar's 20th birthday. He's having fun out here in the 98th US
Open at the Olympic Club, and so is his father/caddie, Peter. The
Georgia Tech junior upstaged his playing partners _ defending
champion Ernie Els and British Open champion Justin Leonard _ in
the first two rounds, but what else is new? He stole the spotlight
from Tiger Woods at the Masters in April.
</P>
<P>
   This amateur can hit it out there with Woods, he can sink putts
with Ben Crenshaw, and he has the personality of an Arnold Palmer.
Kuchar, who was at 1 under through two rounds, may be a future star
in the sport, but right now he is simply a college kid charming the
galleries in the game's majors.
</P>
<P>
   Kuchar, whose grandfather was an offensive lineman for the
University of New Hampshire in the '40s, lit up the press room at
Olympic the same way he did at Augusta. Asked if he were surprised
or excited after his first two rounds, Kuchar replied, ``Both.
Surprised and excited.''
</P>
<P>
   This is as much a fantasy for his father and grandfather as it
is for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you ever get used to it,'' said Kuchar. ``The
feeling you get playing golf is different than anything else. The
nervousness. That feeling of being in contention. I guess it's a
feeling that I don't know if you will ever get used to. It's
exciting when you get that twinge in your stomach. That's really
what golf is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kuchar was at Augusta, he talked about his studies, his
friends, and his college team. There will be a temptation to turn
pro, though, and he'd be a welcome addition to the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt myself turning professional before school ends,'' said
Kuchar, the reigning US Amateur champion. ``But I really don't
know. I really haven't thought about it. Dad and I haven't even
talked about it. It's all up in the air. I'm just rolling with
everything right now.''
</P>
<P>
   No amateur has won the US Open since Johnny Goodman in 1933. The
odds of a collegian doing it are extremely long, but who knows what
Kuchar is capable of?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you start thinking about winning, it's not good,'' said
Kuchar. ``I remember in the junior tournaments I was thinking,
`What am I going to say in my acceptance speech?' I would be
playing in the last group and think, `What am I going say when I
get the trophy?' I never won a single junior event.''
</P>
<P>
   Take it away, Tom
</P>
<P>
   Tom Watson, who returned to the winner's circle at the age of 48
last month at the Colonial, recounted that triumph before the Open,
where he missed the cut after 73-75_148: ``I still believe that I
can swing the golf club and hit the ball straight. I made a slight
change in the takeaway. I did the same thing with the putter. I
shot 66 in the pro-am and I said, `Well, it's working now. Let's
play. See if it works during the regular tournament.' It did.
Emotionally, I was honestly thinking, `Well, is this maybe my last
tournament I am ever going to win on the tour?' That's the reason a
tear or two came out. I am enjoying the twilight of my career.''
... Jaime Ortiz-Patino, the owner, president, and superintendent at
Valderrama GC in Sotogrande, Spain, which was venue for the Ryder
Cup last September, has been selected to receive the Old Tom Morris
Award from the Golf Course Superintendents Association of America.
Ortiz-Patino is also on the board of directors at the Lahey Clinic
and plays golf at Weston GC and Brae Burn CC on his visits to the
Greater Boston area ... Lee Westwood is Great Britain's rising star
and may be a regular on the US PGA Tour next year. ``I haven't made
my mind up yet,'' he said. ``I really enjoy playing here. I enjoy
playing in Europe as well. But there a lot of incentives to join
this tour next year, and it is going to be a difficult decision.''
... Els, whose back spasms forced him to withdraw from Westchester
the week before the Open, may reduce a global schedule that has him
playing in his homeland of South Africa, Europe, Australia, and on
the PGA Tour. ``We will see how it goes,'' he said. ``Obviously I
have got to take that into consideration now, not to travel too
much. But I really enjoy playing around the world, so I have really
got to just reconsider and see how the back reacts in the next
couple of weeks. I've never had any back problems. I've been quite
healthy. It's serious, but it's not the kind of injury which is
going to affect my schedule in years to come, hopefully. We will
take it as it comes the next couple of weeks.'' ... Jack Nicklaus,
playing in his 42d consecutive US Open, is still competitive at the
age of 58. ``I think I've been fortunate from a health standpoint
that I have never been injured to the point where I couldn't
play,'' said Nicklaus. ``I always point and prepared myself for
these events and was always ready to play when I got there. If I
were playing tournament golf every day, I probably would have been
injured more. I've been very lucky.'' ... Tom Lehman, who has led
the last three US Opens entering the final round, followed an
opening 68 with a 75 Friday. He talked about his hopes entering the
competition: ``I try not to think about it. It's a very, very, very
hard golf course.'' ... Olin Browne, who has roots in the Greater
Boston area and played a lot of golf at The Country Club, qualified
for this year's US Open by finishing joint fifth last year at
Congressional. ``If you hit fairways, you have a chance to score,''
said Browne after making the cut on 73-70_143. ``If you don't,
you're DOA. The problem in the Open is that every shot requires
precision. The pin positions require delicate approaches and you
have to be cautious all day.''

   Paul Kennedy grew up in Natick, Mass., and attended Xaverian
High School and Nichols College, beginning a journey that today
finds him general manager of the Olympic Club. He worked at the
Lighthouse Inn in West Dennis when he was in college, landed a
position at the Wigwam Resort in Phoenix for seven years, and now
is in his 10th year presiding over the West Coast's most noted
athletic/golf complex. The US Open, of course, is its major event.
``The set-up began a year ago,'' said Kennedy. ``Now, it's just
finally, `Get out of its way and let it happen.' There are
financial benefits to the club, but the club's a strong believer in
giving back to the game.'' The affiliated athletic club downtown is
sponsoring four athletes for the US Olympic team _ a decathlete, a
cyclist, a javelin thrower, and a water polo player. ``That's what
the club's about,'' said Kennedy. ``Taking care of the amateur
athlete.'' ... Ryder Cup fever continues to heat up. The PGA of
America reports that more than 30,000 ticket applications from 12
countries and all 50 states have been received in the first week.
Entries will be accepted through Aug. 31, and a random drawing will
be conducted in September. The public can apply via the Internet at
www.pga.com or by calling 1-888-RYDER CUP between 10 a.m. and 9
p.m. There is a nonrefundable $5 application fee and a maximum
number of two tickets per person available ... Geoff Sisk will
defend his title in the 89th Massachusetts Open, which begins its
three-day run Monday at Oak Hill CC. He's one of 10 former winners
in the field of 153 competing for the $12,000 first prize out of a
total purse of $60,000 ... The field for the Willowbend Children's
Pro-Am on June 29 includes 1998 PGA Tour winners Stuart Appleby
(Kemper), Watson (Colonial), and Mark Calcavecchia (Honda), plus
Billy Andrade, Craig Stadler, Tom Kite, Scott Hoch, Frank Nobilo,
and Brad Faxon.
</P>
<P>
   Up a tree
</P>
<P>
   Paul Simson, who is vice president of an insurance company in
Raleigh, N.C., and became a reinstated amateur in 1978, had a bit
of an adventure in his opening round of 76. He lost a ball in a
tree on the 10th hole and went with son/caddie Phil to look for it.
``We were climbing up in the tree and found seven or eight balls
that were lodged up there,'' said Simson, who had to return to the
tee with a one-stroke penalty, and ended up with a triple bogey on
the par-4 hole. Two spectators said they saw somebody pick up his
ball when it bounced out of the tree and into heavy rough. But once
Simson played the provisional ball, no adjustments could be made
... The consensus after the USGA's press conference Wednesday
regarding the ``material and construction of a club face'' was that
it was much ado about very little. The USGA backed off on declaring
some clubs illegal and thus avoided possible litigation from
equipment manufacturers. ``All clubs have some springlike effect,
because all clubs deform at impact,'' said USGA executive director
David Fay. ``Two questions need to be answered. No. 1, can the
concept of springlike effect be clearly defined? No. 2, assuming it
can, should there be a limit of springlike effect in a golf club?
The intent of the rule is clear, but the current language in the
rule book requires clarification. We recently developed a test that
can measure in terms of velocity the springlike effect in club
heads. We expect to release the particulars of this proposed test
protocol to manufacturers within the next few weeks. The test
itself will be based on the rebound velocity of a golf ball off a
club face. Golf constantly evolves. We have a responsibility to all
who are involved to set clearly defined, clearly understood
standards that anticipate emerging technology and maintain the
fundamental challenge of the game.'' Play away, please.

US TO FACE IRAN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By John Powers 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LYON, France _ The Americans had this date circled back in
December when the draw was made. ``The Iran match we must win,''
coach Steve Sampson said then. Now, after being blanked by Germany
last week, the US has absolutely no choice. If the Americans can't
beat the Iranians Sunday at Stade Gerland, they'll be all but gone
from the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Same goes for their rivals, though, who lost their opener to
Yugoslavia and figure they'll have little hope against the Germans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we are to have a chance,'' acknowledges Iranian coach Jalal
Talebi, ``we must beat the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   If the political pressure from home is greater on Iran, the
sporting pressure is greater on the US, which came here
legitimately hoping to make the second round, then played like awed
amateurs for the first half of a 2-0 loss to the Germans.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a lot of us, this is about redeeming ourselves in front of
the world,'' says defender Alexi Lalas. ``We want to prove this is
a quality team that deserves to be in the second round.''
</P>
<P>
   So the US is determined to attack the Iranians from the opening
whistle, create multiple scoring chances, and knock in at least a
couple of goals. That hasn't happened often this year, but the
Yanks concede that it had better happen Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a game where we can't settle in,'' says Sampson. ``We
have to impose ourselves very quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yanks were imposed upon by the Germans, giving up a goal in
the ninth minute and not managing a shot on goal until the 30th.
Not this time, vows their coach, who said his squad will be running
and banging and risking from the go.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to have a much stronger physical presence,'' says
Sampson, who may have as many as four different faces in his
starting lineup, starting with midfielders Tab Ramos and Frankie
Hejduk. ``We have to be closing down, tackling hard, winning the
balls in the air. The one-on-one matchups have to be absolutely
dominant.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Americans concede that beating Iran won't be easy,
even though the Iranians needed a near-miracle to qualify. They
know Iran will come in pumped to the skies by the idea of knocking
off Uncle Sam. They remember that Iran came from two goals down
with 14 minutes left to tie Australia on the road to get here. And
they've seen the videos of Iran's 1-0 loss to Yugoslavia, when the
goal came on a free kick 18 minutes from time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of respect for those guys,'' says striker Eric
Wy-nalda.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's top three stars _ strikers Ali Daei and Khodadad Azizi
and midfielder Karim Bagheri _ all play for clubs in Germany's
Bundesliga. They supply the punch in Talebi's counterattacking
3-5-2 system, which allows them to free-lance.
</P>
<P>
   If the Americans are too careless going forward, the Iranians
will sting them on the counter. But after scoring in only one of
its last four matches, the US can't afford to worry about getting
caught upfield. Timidity in the World Cup gets you an early ticket
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what we did wrong against Germany,'' says midfielder
Ernie Stewart. ``We came out with too much respect. Iran has been
away from the world scene for 20 years. We should go at them with a
lot of intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   Iran hasn't played in the Cup since 1978 and doesn't expect to
win a match here. The Americans, who reached the second round last
time, have beaten the Brazilians this year. The Iranians, who are
on their fourth coach since November, lost, 7-1, to AS Roma last
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a team we should beat,'' Lalas says, simply.
</P>
<P>
   If the Americans defeat Iran by two goals and Germany does the
same to Yugoslavia, the US can advance by tying the Yugoslavs in
Nantes on Thursday. But the goal-differential arithmetic can wait
</P>
<P>
   ``The key for us is to play to win,'' Sampson says. ``If we win,
4-3, that's 3 points _ and we go on from there.''

DOWN THE STRETCH THEY COME  
 LEHMAN TIED FOR 2ND AS STEWART WIDENS GAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ This time, Tom Lehman does not have to carry the
burden of the lead into the final round of the U.S. Open. That
weight belongs to Payne Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   It is a mighty one if the history of this tournament at the
Olympic Club is any indication. Nicknamed the ``John Wilkes Booth
of Golf Courses,'' this notorious tract has shot down every
third-round leader who has ever dared to try to win the national
championship here.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Hogan, Arnold Palmer and Tom Watson took the lead into the
final round in 1955, '66 and '87, respectively. No one came out
alive. Palmer blew a 7-shot lead over the last nine holes, then an
18-hole playoff to Billy Casper the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, who led or shared the lead in the previous three Opens,
called the historical reference ``encouraging.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're really nervous, these fairways look like they're
an inch wide, because of all the slope,'' said Lehman. He and Bob
Tway are the closest pursuers to Stewart, who is 4 shots in front
with 18 holes to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you're the leader, and all you have to do is put
the ball in play, it's a very tall task,'' Lehman said. ``So you
can get pretty nervous with the lead on this course. Guys who are
behind don't have that kind of pressure, and it's easier to put a
good swing on it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stewart has a bit of history working for him, too. His
4-shot lead is the largest since Tony Jacklin led the 1970 Open at
Hazeltine near Minneapolis. And Jacklin ended up winning by 7
shots.
</P>
<P>
   Without question, Stewart said, he would sooner be out front
than trying to catch up. History doesn't bother him one bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I thought I had played the last three rounds with smoke and
mirrors, I'd be kidding myself,'' said Stewart, the 1991 Open champ
at Hazeltine, where he beat Scott Simpson in an 18-hole playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played some good golf the past three days, and there is
no reason to think I won't keep doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was a tough day to play golf, as only three of the
remaining 60 players broke par. When the last ball had floated
through the ocean breeze and quit rolling on the hard, tight
fairways, only Stewart was under par for 54 holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Par is a hell of a score here, and any time you make it, you
shouldn't be disappointed,'' said the bubbly Stewart, whose 70 left
him at 3-under 207. ``I just hope I can keep doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who has only one victory since his '91 Open win (1995
Houston Open), got his day off to a fast start, running in an eagle
at the first hole from 18 feet. There also was a spectacular 7-iron
at No. 8 that settled within tap-in range for another birdie. Even
though he made three bogeys, there were big saves at the 17th and
18th holes.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman's 68 tied him for the low round of the day, and it began
almost as incredibly, as he ran in three straight birdies. Too bad
for him they were followed by three straight bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   ``The course played extremely difficult,'' said the Scottsdale
pro, who got two more birdies via a chip-in from 15 feet at No. 14
and a 6-foot putt at the 18th, where he had taken a disastrous,
double-bogey 6 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Tway hung on all day, absorbing three bogeys and a double. But
he managed to sink a 3-foot birdie at the 18th for a 73 that kept
him within striking distance.
</P>
<P>
   Two other big hitters, Nick Price (71) and Lee Janzen (73), who
edged Stewart in the 1993 Open at Baltusrol, also were right there.
But it might be a reach for Steve Stricker (69) and Jeff Maggert
(75), who trailed by 6 strokes.
</P>
<P>
   Pre-tournament favorites Tiger Woods (71, 7 over), David Duval
(75, 8 over) and defending champ Ernie Els (75, 10 over) are out of
the chase. Along with Casey Martin (74, 9 over), they have early
tee times today.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, everyone will be out there fairly early by Open
standards. And that is something that pleases Lehman to a ``T.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The nice thing about playing here in San Francisco is that
there's a 12:30 start for the last group, as opposed to a 3 or 3:30
start (like at the British Open or Masters)'' said Lehman, who
earned the privilege of being paired with Stewart because his 1
over was posted before Tway's score.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having to wait around all day to play sometimes can be very
difficult, and playing at 12:30 is so much easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it will be the difference for Lehman, who has finished
third, second and third the past three years while waiting to play
late in the day in the Eastern time zone in New York (Shinnecock),
Michigan (Oakland Hills) and Washington, D.C. (Congressional). &QL;

KUCHAR IN CHARGE OF GOLF FUN POLICE  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It won't be the knickers. It won't be the cart.
It won't be the expletives directed at pin placement or a bunch of
whiny golfers commiserating about the course. The enduring symbol
of the U.S. Open _ and maybe the entire season _ will be the smile.
</P>
<P>
   It started in Georgia, bigger than Mark O'Meara's green jacket.
It has stretched all the way to California, brighter than Payne
Stewart's wardrobe. And it belongs to an amateur who is baffling
experts with his poise, melting galleries with his grin.
</P>
<P>
   The look of a teen who just scored a fake ID and front-row
tickets for Megadeth.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Kuchar turns 20 today, and already he is teaching his
peers. If everyone could loosen up and enjoy himself like this kid,
well, golf wouldn't desperately need a visit from the fun police.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having a great time,'' Kuchar said. ``But I'm a pretty
laid-back, positive guy. I enjoy doing just about anything.''
</P>
<P>
   So the fantasy exploded Saturday afternoon, a string of bogeys
that spiked Kuchar's chances of becoming the first amateur in 65
years to win the Open. Doesn't matter because through it all, the
smile remained. It was contagious and emerged after every shot. And
when he approached the 18th green, the gallery gave him a standing
ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, they understood the magnitude of it all. Kuchar, who just
finished his sophomore year at Georgia Tech, isn't even the best
player on his college team. He didn't win an NCAA championship. He
didn't even win the conference tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in two of golf's headline events, Kuchar has been
unflappable. He shot even par at the Masters, tying for 21st place,
walking away from $40,000 because of his amateur status. And after
50 holes at the Open, Kuchar was in third place, taming a course
that sent most of the field searching for liquid aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   For two days, Kuchar was paired with the Ernie Els and Justin
Leonard, defending champions from the U.S. and British Open. After
36 holes, he flattened both by a combined 13 strokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been beaten by amateurs in a long time,'' Els said.
``But all the credit to him. He's really a good kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more solid: In the four professional tournaments Kuchar has
entered, his worst round is 76. It happened at Augusta, when
howling winds descended upon the second round. It happened
Saturday, when the boa constrictor known as The Olympic Club
finally put the squeeze on Kuchar.
</P>
<P>
   But it couldn't kill the smile. Or the uproarious embrace from
the paying customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're rooting for me, so I'm doing the same,'' Kuchar said.
``I think I learned that from Arnie (Palmer). He'd give people a
wink, and they'd respond to that.''
</P>
<P>
   By golfing standards, the Kuchars might be having too much fun,
the kid stealing the show, the father/caddie pumping his fists
after every good shot. On Friday, Leonard was asked whether the
histrionics emoting from the elder Kuchar were a bit over the top.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next question,'' Leonard said. ``It does me no good to answer
that question. Do you understand?''
</P>
<P>
   Sure do. They simply exceed the legal limit for happiness on a
golf course.
</P>
<P>
   But this is why the galleries have adopted him. It is why, after
settling for par on 18, they gave him another standing ovation,
complete with chants of ``Kooch, Kooch, Kooch.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, he simply smiled some more.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really what golf is all about,'' Kuchar said.
</P>
<P>
   Now that final exams are over, Kuchar has a tough decision to
make. He doesn't want to shut the door on college, but he is
thriving on the allure of big-time golf. He must decide whether to
turn pro, cashing in his innocence for prize money. And somewhere,
a toothpaste company has discovered the perfect spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   But all of that can wait. For now, he has one more day in the
sun, one more day to bask in a love affair that has turned his
peers a shade of green and the golfing world on its ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of a better way to spend my birthday,'' he
said. &QL;

NEW PLAY FOR KASPER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By Kevin Paul Dupont 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steve Kasper will be at the NHL entry draft Saturday in Buffalo,
but with a different perspective this time. He's been there both as
a player (drafted 81st overall by the Bruins in 1980) and a coach
(most recently in 1996, when he was about to enter his second year
behind the Boston bench).
</P>
<P>
   This time he'll be there as Kasper Sports Management
International. Once one of the most dogged checkers in the game,
the 35-year-old Kasper is now an agent, certified last month with
the NHL Players' Association and already with his first player
signed to an NHL contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe part of it relates to my coaching experience,'' said
Kasper, asked what he likes about his new career, which he launched
one year after being dismissed as the Bruins' bench boss. ``I like
the idea of controlling what I'm doing and answering to myself.
That's a very good feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Michigan Tech forward Andre Savage, recently signed by the
Bruins as a free agent, became Kasper's first client. Savage was
referred to Kasper by Tech coach Tim Watters, who spent a season
with Kasper in Boston before departing for the college ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Kasper fired out a Savage highlight film to all 27 NHL
franchises, followed up, and found that Boston had the most
interest. When the deal got done, it was Kasper sitting across the
desk from Harry Sinden, the man who drafted him as an 18-year-old,
then hired him as Boston's head coach 15 years later, then sent him
packing last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting dismissed is part of the game,'' said Kasper, asked if
it felt awkward to deal with Sinden only a year after being
cashiered. ``I've said all along, I'm content with what I did in my
time coaching the Bruins. As far as dealing with Harry goes, well,
he's always dealt with me with respect, and it's not as if I've
been a total stranger around (the FleetCenter). I saw a lot of
games there last year. I've been around.''
</P>
<P>
   Upon being dismissed, Kasper could have joined the Bruins' front
office but elected to look elsewhere. Last summer, he interviewed
for broadcast openings here in Boston and also talked with the
Ducks about their head coaching vacancy, a job that opened again
last week when Pierre Page was fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I could have stayed part of it,'' said Kasper. ``But you
know, I really don't want to get into that. It was an opportunity
that I could have stayed involved ... but I just thought at this
time it's better for Steve Kasper to go on his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm happy to do what I'm doing. It's hard work. It's very
competitive, but everything is in today's world. It wasn't as if
coaching was a lifelong dream of mine. But an opportunity was
presented to me, I took advantage of it, and I did enjoy it. I
still love the game, and I want to be a part of it, and this is one
way I might be able to help someone along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   The winning formula
</P>
<P>
   No one's asking, but if I were looking to get a franchise off
the ground, I'd find the right paperwork-and-detail guy to go with
Scotty Bowman, then just hand the whole thing over to them. Then
check back in no less than three years and see if that team hasn't
made it to at least the conference finals. In the meantime, Bowman
is under contract to work the Detroit bench for one more season,
but as of late last week he hadn't made up his mind for '98-99. He
was hinting heavily after the Game 4 clincher vs. the Capitals that
it could be time to retire ... The Bruins are contemplating a
change in starting times for weeknight games, from 7:30 to 7 p.m.
Season ticket-holders, recently mailed their renewal forms, were
asked their opinion. Initial returns show nearly a 2-to-1 vote in
favor of dropping the puck earlier. If it remains that positive,
the change will be made. The Canadiens are moving up a half-hour
next season. The Penguins, after switching to 7 p.m. last year, are
going back to 7:30 ... Business has been brisk in the Bruins'
season-ticket office, where orders have been written for more than
800 new sales (42 home dates). Among the hottest summer sellers:
the back four rows of Sections 307-310, the end where the Bruins
shoot twice per game. One seat to all 42 games sells for $630,
about the economic equivalent of a five-cent cigar by today's
standards ... Brian Burke remains on the job as NHL vice president
in charge of almost everything, especially the dirty work of fines
and suspensions, but he is expected to leave this offseason for a
GM's job, possibly as early as Monday, when, according to one
rumor, he will get the Vancouver job ... A New York Post report
during the Stanley Cup finals had Burke being replaced by former
Ranger coach Colin Campbell, who is still being paid by New York
... Nice break Steve Shields got Friday, being traded to San Jose.
The former Michigan netminder spent the last two seasons as Dominik
Hasek's understudy, rarely seeing the ice other than from the
bench, and now he'll have a chance to be a bona fide No. 1 with the
Sharks. He's big (6 feet 3 inches, 210 pounds), and he showed in
last year's playoffs, when Hasek got hurt in the opening round vs.
the Senators, that he can do the job ... NHL GMs recognized a real
need to improve the game last week when they recommended a variety
of rule changes, including phasing in two referees, moving the nets
another 2 feet off the rear boards, and shaving the sides off the
shaded crease area that has triggered infractions and nullified
goals (hello, Tim Taylor). The Board of Governors is expected to
rubber-stamp the recommendations in Toronto Thursday morning, prior
to the annual awards ceremonies that night.
</P>
<P>
   Brotherly shove
</P>
<P>
   If the Mighty Ducks have even the slightest clue that they know
what they're doing, they're keeping it one of the Original
Twentysomething's best-kept secrets. They drummed Page out of town
on Monday, less than a year after naming him as Ron Wilson's
replacement. Not to be melodramatic, said Ferreira, but he looks at
Page as a brother. Now there's family for you. No replacement yet,
but round up the usual suspects: Ted Nolan, Marc Crawford, Jacques
Lemaire, et al (one day the league will construct a giant recycling
bin for these guys on the sidewalk outside league HQs in
Manhattan). Meanwhile, Ferreira will scale back on his duties
considerably, with much of the detail work to be handled by David
McNab (brother of former Bruin Peter McNab), who had a shot to
become Atlanta's GM until the Ducks withdrew permission for him to
negotiate with the slow-to-decide Thrashers ... The Blackhawks
haven't named a coach to replace Craig Hartsburg yet, but GM Bob
Murray recently said he has completed interviews, and Crawford was
not on the talk-to list. ESPN's Barry Melrose remains a contender,
but not as much as he would make it sound ... Rumor had the Devils
trading ex-US Olympian Mike Dunham, Martin Brodeur's backup at Exit
16W, to the Oilers on Thursday, but the deal didn't get done. The
Devils could lose him for nothing in Friday's expansion draft at
Buffalo that will stock Nashville. The Oilers, with Curtis Joseph
about to depart, could use Dunham ... Rather than lose ex-Bruin
netminder Andy Moog to Nashville, the Canadiens might send some
minor league bodies to the Predators as compensation for passing on
Moog. Moog is on record as saying he would retire rather than go to
an expansion club, but he is under contract with the Habs, at a
price of $2 million, for next season. There aren't many who would
walk from that kind of cash ... Five goals in 35 games for the
Devils and offseason surgery to repair nerve damage in his right
wrist. Jason Arnott may be a young, talented Group 2 free agent,
but bad numbers and a bad wrist are going to make it difficult to
reach into GM Lou Lamoriello's pocket. Arnott worked for $1.8
million last year and would expect a bump to at least $2.5 million,
perhaps more on a long-term deal. This is one that has ``holdout''
written all over it, unless the Devils move him this summer ...
Ex-Bruin Eddie Westfall won't be a regular in the Islanders'
broadcast booth next season, supplanted after 19 years by a
broadcaster to be named later. No. 18 will contribute pregame
features and reports, but a new partner will be found for
play-by-play man Howie Rose ... Crawford is free to sign on
anywhere as coach next season, following mediation last week
between the coach and his former employer, the Avalanche. Depending
on how Crawford's new club does next season _ presuming he gets
hired _ Colorado will end up with either a first- or second-round
pick in the '99 draft.
</P>
<P>
   The next Mario?
</P>
<P>
   The Lightning will take Rimouski (Quebec League) center Vincent
Lecavalier in Saturday's entry draft. He's 6-4, French-Canadian,
and rated No. 1 in North America by Central Scouting _ ergo the
comparisons to Mario Lemieux, who was all of that and more entering
the 18-year-old draft in '84. Colorado owns four first-round picks,
including Boston's, and likely will try to swap all of them for the
right to take Lecavalier, who just so happens to be represented by
Bob Sauve, former partner in the agent business with Pierre
Lacroix, now the Avalanche GM (sometimes it seems like the same
10-12 guys run the entire hockey business). Colorado has the Nos.
12, 17, 19, and 20 picks to offer; if someone had given the
Penguins that for Lemieux in '84, here's what it would have netted:
Gary Roberts (12, Calgary), Kevin Hatcher (17, Washington), Dave
Pasin (19, Boston) and Duncan MacPherson (20, NY Islanders). Forget
it ... July 1 marks NHL free agency. You may be surprised to learn
that former Bruin Geoff Courtnall, who earned $2.5 million in St.
Louis last year, will enter the pool as the group's biggest goal
scorer from 1997-98 (31). Since departing Boston in the swap for
Moog, the now 35-year-old left winger has broken 40 goals once and
30 goals four times. Courtnall joined the Blues as a free agent in
the summer of '95, signing a three-year deal valued at $6.8 million
... Hmm. The Chelioses of Chicago invited the Hulls of St. Louis to
the NBA Finals. They were USA teammates at Nagano. More and more it
appears they'll be teammates in Chicago. Hull remains adamant about
a three-year, $15 million, no-trade contract from the Blues, and
they're not ponying up the third-year guarantee ... Kings coach
Larry Robinson was unimpressed by former Bruin Jozef Stumpel down
the stretch drive, with Stumpel scoring only 2 goals in the final
21 regular-season games and going 1-2_3 in the four-game playoff
flop vs. the Blues. Robinson to the Long Beach Press-Telegram: ``I
don't think he played like a No. 1 center in the playoffs. He did
all year, but when it came to crunch time, when they were putting
two or three guys on him, I don't think he did it consistently.''
Stumpel will make $1.65 million next season ... Hard-shooting
defenseman Vladimir Malakhov, his neck too sore for him to suit up
against Buffalo in what proved the Habs' elimination game, recently
saw Montreal take a three-year, $7.5 million offer off the table.
The offer was made during the regular season, well before Malakhov
pulled the 'chute vs. the Sabres. It all adds up to Malakhov
getting moved ... Now that John Muckler has hired Keith Acton as an
assistant coach with the Rangers, don't be surprised to see
ex-Oiler Charlie Huddy join the staff. Huddy most recently has been
head coach in Huntington, W.Va., in the ECHL ... The Lightning
picked up Bill Ranford from Washington, thinking they'll expose the
oft-injured Daren Puppa in the expansion draft. One problem: If no
one takes Puppa, the Bolts will have to write checks for both
Ranford and Puppa next season, a total of $5.3 million. And no one
knows for sure whether Ranford or Puppa can be a No. 1 netminder. A
shaky start for the Bolts' new ownership.

GRIER A GAMBLER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By Ron Borges 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bob Kraft often says he wants his managers to take risks, and
he'll back them when they do. Maybe Bobby Grier took that idea a
bit too literally.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest issue of Pro Football Weekly, Joel Buchsbaum, a
journalist by accident but a draftnik by inclination and obsession,
lists the top 10 gambles in April's draft. According to Buchsbaum
and the NFL scouts he spoke with, Grier made four of the first
eight bets and he put the house on them.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps his own house, if things don't pan out.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of such analyses are easily ignored by career
football men like Grier, who understand that they know more about
this stuff than anyone else because they get paid to. But Buchsbaum
is the exception because he gets paid, too. He has proven over the
years to be more than a draftnik, his expertise in this rather
arcane process having grown to the point where, supposedly, more
than a few NFL teams have him on retainer as an adviser.
</P>
<P>
   He is well-respected by some of the league's best selectors of
talent, men such as Green Bay's Ron Wolf and San Diego's Bobby
Beathard, who have built Super Bowl teams at two or more addresses.
When such men endorse Buchsbaum's opinions by endorsing his annual
draft previews, it gives weight to his words.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, it is not comforting to find him putting both of the
Patriots' first-round picks at the top of what he calls his ``Gut
Check'' list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here are some names that scouts offered as either the gutsiest
or riskiest picks in this year's draft,'' Buchsbaum wrote, listing
Tebucky Jones first and Robert Edwards third, with Minnesota's
Randy Moss in between. Not far behind were New England's
second-round choices, Tony Simmons, listed as the sixth-riskiest,
and Rod Rutledge, who was eighth. That's a lot of risk, especially
considering that with the quality of the team New England already
had, there was little need to gamble with this draft.
</P>
<P>
   Grier declined to comment on that or anything else this past
week, saying he wanted to keep a low profile until training camp
opens because ``nothing's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   It is safe to conclude that a man who has been in the NFL for
much of his adult life understands that few teams hit on the
majority of their top picks. Wolf and his pal, Bill Parcells, have
often said that if you hit 25 percent in the draft you've done
well. With that as a measuring stick, Grier saw himself with six of
the first 84 picks and went for the big reward fully aware of the
big risk.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, a defensive back, was intriguing to many coaches because
of his unusual size/speed combination, but as Buchsbaum points out,
he ``could be another Lester Hayes or another Anthony Phillips ...
the all-time workout warrior.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody looks better in a uniform than Jones and nobody looks
better running the 40. But the Patriots were careful to keep him
away from their top receivers during the spring minicamps as they
broke him into a cornerback position that he's never played before.
</P>
<P>
   Head coach Pete Carroll and Grier know the cornerback business
is as much mental as physical, and there was no need to risk
Jones's psyche this early. But eventually he will have to cover
such receivers, and if he can do it, why wasn't he doing it in
college?
</P>
<P>
   As for running back Edwards, the concern is twofold. Buchsbaum
and the scouts point out that he's never lasted a full college
season without injury and now he's coming into a league where the
season is twice as long.
</P>
<P>
   Fine, but that's only the half of it. The other half is that the
same rap was put on Curtis Martin when he came out of Pitt, and he
answered every charge as well as the bell on nearly every down
until late last season. Is it not tempting fate to ask his
replacement to do the same? If you believe in bad karma, poor
Edwards would seem to be walking into it.
</P>
<P>
   As for Simmons, I've seen a lot of coaches go broke on speed
merchants who were ``underproductive in college,'' as they like to
say in the NFL. That he and Jones have unlimited potential is true,
something Carroll pointed out to me last month. But I kept hearing
the words of my father, who used to say, ``Potential just means you
haven't done a damn thing yet.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Rutledge, the consensus is that he could help a battered
Ben Coates if he can play the way he did before injuring his knee.
</P>
<P>
   But of everything that was written by Buchsbaum, the most
illustrative comment of the route Kraft, Grier, and Carroll chose
this spring was this quote from a scout:
</P>
<P>
   ``In our mind, all four of the Patriots' first- and second-round
picks were high-risk picks who could make them the team to beat in
all of football or make them look awfully bad for letting Curtis
Martin go.''
</P>
<P>
   If the former is true, Kraft will never have to show how much
risk he's willing to back. But if the latter is true, Grier will
have to hope Kraft meant what he said about his willingness to
bankroll a gambling employee knowing they didn't build Las Vegas by
letting the gamblers win very often.
</P>
<P>
   A recount on draft
</P>
<P>
   They won't have a team in Cleveland until 1999 but the new
Browns have already caused the Patriots a small headache. An
agreement has been reached between the league and the NFL Players
Association on how to stock the expansion Browns, and it is similar
to the process by which Jacksonville and Carolina acquired players.
That means the Patriots' extra draft choices next season just went
down in value a couple of notches because the Browns will have the
first pick in each of the seven rounds as well as an extra pick at
the end of those rounds. In addition to the extra picks, the Browns
will be allowed to select 30 veterans from an expansion draft list,
to whom they will have to pay at least $22 million of their salary
cap ... Whoever ends up with the Cleveland franchise will have
plenty of cash to pay the players. More than 52,000 season tickets
have been sold _ for a team that doesn't exist and will play in a
stadium that doesn't exist. Why did Art Modell ever leave? ... Word
is as soon as the collective bargaining agreement extension is
signed, Buffalo will hand new quarterback Rob Johnson a huge
contract extension that will pay $4 million-$5 million a season
with at least a $6 million signing bonus. Think what they might
have paid him if he'd started two NFL games instead of just one ...
Bills linebacker Chris Spielman was at recent minicamp practices at
5:30 a.m., even though the medical staff won't let him participate
in contact drills yet, as he is coming off neck surgery ... When
the Broncos released journeyman safety Dedrick Dodge last week, it
was a footnote in football history. Dodge is one of only 13 players
to be on winning Super Bowl teams in both conferences. In 1994,
Dodge was a reserve on the San Francisco 49ers ... Although noted
orator and All-Pro defensive end Reggie White has been working
several hours a day on rehabilitating his back, soreness kept him
out of the team's recent minicamp workouts. White nearly was forced
into retirement because of persistent back spasms and constant pain
last season, but he has rededicated himself to prepare for the 1998
season. With Gabe Wilkins lost to free agency, No. 1 draft choice
Vonnie Holliday has the inside track on the right defensive end
position, with the team still hoping White can be a regular on the
left side ... Don't want to say Parcells believes in loyalty or
anything, but a look at the Jets roster going into next month's
training camp finds 11 ex-Patriots and ex-Giants on it ... Jets
wide receiver Wayne Chrebet, who is among the all-time
overachievers in NFL history, believes he will not be sharing his
position this year, although he will be back in the slot receiver's
spot in many formations. Although Chrebet has caught 208 passes in
his three years in the NFL, last year he had to split time with the
now-departed Jeff Graham. Dedric Ward and Alex Van Dyke are
expected to press him again this year, but Chrebet has been told he
and Keyshawn Johnson will be the regulars. ``The three-man rotation
is over and done with for now,'' Chrebet said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Don't brace yourself
</P>
<P>
   Jacksonville quarterback Mark Brunell has decided to play this
season without the bulky knee brace that he felt limited his
mobility last season. He suffered a severe knee injury from which
he rebounded far faster than most thought possible, and now he is
going to tempt fate by opting for mobility over protection ...
Congratulations are due old friend Hugh Millen. The ex-Patriots
quarterback, who is now retired in Seattle after playing more than
10 years in the NFL, is to be married in Colorado. And they said it
couldn't be done ... Word is Kraft is among nearly a dozen NFL
owners who have expressed an interest to commissioner Paul
Tagliabue in buying Arena Football franchises. Saints boss Tom
Benson has opened the way by gaining league approval to purchase
one. Benson paid $7 million for his Arena franchise this year,
one-10th what he paid for the Saints in 1985. The reason for the
owners' interest is to keep young fans interested in football
year-round. Efforts to reach Kraft were unsuccessful. His secretary
said he was out of the country ... The Dolphins' No. 1 draft
choice, running back John Avery, apparently takes things seriously.
After fumbling during a recent minicamp, he reportedly has been
lugging a ball around with him everywhere he goes, including on
dates and when he goes to bed ... Denver's 36-year-old All-Pro left
tackle, Gary Zimmerman, did not appear at either of the Broncos'
spring minicamps and has not decided whether he will return for
another season. Zimmerman briefly retired last season but was lured
back early in the year, forcing Tony Jones to shift from left
tackle to the right side. Many believed that if quarterback John
Elway retired, Zimmerman would have joined him. It is now assumed
he will return with Elway ... On the same day that Tennessee
running back Eddie George underwent arthroscopic knee surgery this
month, his backup, Rodney Thomas, signed a four-year, $4 million
deal. Thomas may be the best backup running back in football ...
Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson signed a familiar face last week to
bolster his leaky defensive line. After failing to come up a winner
in the Sean Gilbert Sweepstakes, Johnson settled for Northeastern
product and ex-Patriot Josh Taves, the defensive MVP of NFL Europe
this spring. Taves, who had nine sacks in 10 games for Jack
Bicknell's Barcelona Dragons, is a veteran of three teams in three
years (Detroit, Jacksonville, New England) but may have a better
chance with Miami than many think. He outweighs all four of the
other Dolphin defensive ends by nearly 20 pounds (he is 6 feet 7
inches, 285 pounds) and will challenge veterans Trace Armstrong and
Danny Stubbs for playing time ... Best wishes to former New
Englander Mike George, the agent for Coates, Vincent Brisby, Irving
Fryar, and others. George, 45, suffered sudden cardiac arrest last
month, and a 100 percent blockage was found in one artery, a
condition his doctors told him was fatal 78 percent of the time.
After undergoing bypass surgery, the Florida-based agent is doing
well, although trying to find a safe haven for Brisby hasn't eased
his stress ... Old friend and Boston University alum Billy Brooks
was recently named director of community development and player
relations for the Colts, the team for which he had more than 50
receptions in six straight seasons. Brooks, who retired after the
1996 season, will be inducted into the Colts' Ring of Honor in
August.

DEL VALLE A DREAMER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By Ron Borges 
c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lou Del Valle believes he knows what's coming next month when he
fights perhaps the best boxer in the world.
</P>
<P>
   So does everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Del Valle believes what's coming is a beating.
</P>
<P>
   So does everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   So we're all in agreement then about the future of the World
Boxing Association light heavywight champion, who will try to unify
the title July 18 against World Boxing Council titleholder Roy
Jones Jr?
</P>
<P>
   Well, not exacatly.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Del Valle thinks he's going to be on the upside of that
beating.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone else thinks he's going to play a role similar to that
of the snare drum in The Ringo Starr Story.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Jones's previous 36 victims, Del Valle believes he has an
edge because once he was paid to be punched around by Jones. But
Jones's former sparring partner argued that this will not be a
sparring session like the 38 rounds they once shared in 1995. This
will be a fight, not a farce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always knew it was going to happen,'' Del Valle said last
week at a press conference in New York called by HBO to announce
that the fight had finally been made after much political
maneuvering between Del Valle's promoter, Cedric Kushner, and the
WBA, which threatened to block Del Valle's biggest payday by
forcing him to make a mandatory defense against an unknown
challenger of its own choosing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the type of person that goes to bed and dreams. I always
dream about certain fights and they always happen. I have that
power.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people in boxing will argue that this is no dream.
</P>
<P>
   But Del Valle is not most people. He's a guy who has grown used
to the underdog's role, having played it in all of his biggest
fights. When he first won the title, Del Valle had to journey to
Aachen, Germany, to face undefeated European champion Eddy
Smulders. Knowing he had no chance of winning a decision in such a
place, Del Valle (27-1, 19 KOs) stopped Smulders in the eighth
round, something few experts thought likely.
</P>
<P>
   Del Valle had learned about winning the hard way when he first
fought for the WBA title a year earlier when, despite bloodying and
dropping champion Virgil Hill in Hill's hometown of Bismarck, N.D.,
he lost a close, controversial decision. Or so the judges said.
</P>
<P>
   With those experiences behind him, Del Valle seemed to feel no
trepidation coming to New York to fight Jones. He sees it as an
opportunity for the former pupil to show his teacher what he's
learned since they last studied together.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I figured him out more than he figured me out,'' Del
Valle contended. ``I really believe I gave him problems the whole
camp.''
</P>
<P>
   If so, Jones (36-1, 31 KOs) didn't notice. He believes Del Valle
has yet to understand the meaning of the word ``problems.'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like (A) he wasn't winning the sparring and (B) I'm
different when I'm mad,'' Jones insisted. ``I'm totally different
when there's a crowd around. I'm not near as fast when I spar. I'm
not near as dangerous. When I spar, I don't have that killer
instinct. So this will be totally different.''
</P>
<P>
   The implication is it will also be painful for Del Valle, who
Jones pointed out never mentioned to him that he'd want to fight
Jones one day. Jones seemed miffed at that, giving the very strong
impression he'd have more to say about it July 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he told me from Day 1 that one day he wanted to fight me, I
would have still sparred with him,'' Jones said. ``I would have
still tried to help him. But at least I would have known where he
was coming from. Instead, he played it cool. He laid low until the
time came to say, `I want Roy Jones.' I can't respect that.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't know enough to beat me.''
</P>
<P>
   As the teacher was saying those words, the pupil was in the
corner.
</P>
<P>
   Smiling.
</P>

   Jones's friend and stablemate Derrick ``Smoke'' Gainer (23-4)
will highlight the undercard in a rematch with former champion
Kevin Kelley (48-2-2). Kelley stopped Gainer in 1995 in a thrilling
contest in which Kelley went down once and Gainer twice until
Gainer was finally counted out in the eighth round. Gainer would
have talked about that fight at the press conference but he missed
the private flight Jones booked from Pensacola. The Champ waits for
no one ... This is the second time Jones has bailed out HBO on
short notice. When the Ike Quartey-Pernell Whitaker fight fell out,
he stepped in and fought Hill on short notice and destroyed him.
This time it was a bout between Naseem Hamed and Kennedy McKinney
that went away when Hamed decided he didn't want to fight until
October. Jones has been playing basketball with a semi-pro team in
Jacksonville and filming a small role in a movie called ``New
Jersey Turnpike,'' about the days of the American Basketball
Association, but he agreed to go back into training to fight Del
Valle ... Jones's apparent change in attitude toward his chosen
profession became clear to HBO when he asked HBO Sports CEO Seth
Abraham if he could fight again in December if he defeats Del Valle
... Oscar De La Hoya says his Sept. 18 rematch with Julio Cesar
Chavez in Las Vegas came about at his insistence. Although no one
gives Chavez a chance to defeat De La Hoya, the young champion has
grown tired of hearing his former idol make lame excuses for why De
La Hoya left him beaten and bloody in their first meeting. ``Chavez
is personal,'' De La Hoya explained. ``That is my fight. He never
gave me the respect I deserved, so now I want to be the first to
knock him out. I'm very disappointed in the way he acted, making
excuses. A lot of people are finding out the real Chavez. It's
terrible to find out my childhood idol is the way he is. I want to
punish him, actually. There'll be no more excuses for him.'' ... De
La Hoya claims his most dangerous opponent at 147 pounds is Jose
Luis Lopez, who so dominated De La Hoya's scheduled Nov. 11
opponent, Yory Boy Campas, that Campas moved up to 154 pounds to
get away from him. ``Lopez has fast hands and a good chin and he's
very powerful,'' De La Hoya said. ``He can really take a punch and
he's got the conditioning, too. I think he's the most dangerous
opponent for me in the welterweight division.'' After much trying,
Lou Duva and Shelley Finkel have convinced Lopez (41-3-2, 32 KOs)
to sign a partnership deal. He now wll be co-managed by Finkel,
Duva, and Rene Martinez. Wonder how that came about ...
Negotiations are being explored once again to try to make an
Evander Holyfield-Lennox Lewis heavyweight title unification fight
in the wake of the cancellation of Holyfield's bout with Henry
Akinwande. The most immediate consequence of that cancellation was
that HBO withdrew it's six-fight, $30 million contract extension
offer to Lewis when he didn't sign it by the June 6 deadline.
Abraham now says he's ``revisiting the landscape. We didn't want to
leave that deal on the table while we're figuring out what to do
next. We wanted to think about whether Holyfield-Lewis can be made
and then decide how to proceed. My father-in-law, Meyer Rubenstein,
is 76. He's a used-machinery dealer. He always told me, `Time heals
all wounds but time wounds all deals.''' Those words had an ominous
ring for Lewis, who may have blown easy money by not signing the
extension.

   Hot young prospect Fernando Vargas (12-0, 12 KOs) faces
world-rated veteran Anthony Stephens (29-9-2, 17 KOs) Tuesday night
at the legendary Blue Horizon in Philadelphia in his first main
event. Underneath him on the USA Network card is old Olympic
teammate and rival Antonio Tarver. Word is Tarver (9-0, 7 KOs) was
irate to learn that his promoter, Philly's J. Russell Peltz, put
Vargas in as the main event ahead of him. Tarver will face a tough
test from Jose Luis Rivera (15-1, 12 KOs) ... Arturo Gatti (29-2,
20 KOs) returns to the ring Aug. 22 on HBO's ``Boxing After Dark''
against Ivan Robinson, who had been set to fight International
Boxing Federation lightweight champion Shane Mosley later this
month until a cut postponed the bout ... Last Saturday was a bad
night not only for WBC light-weight champion Stevie Johnston but
also for Mosley. The two had hoped to set up a lucrative (for
lightweights, at least) unification match on HBO but Johnston was
upset by Cesar Bazan ... The WBA has given the Acaries brothers 30
days to reschedule a postponed May 16 title fight between Quartey
and Andrei Pastriev. The brothers claim Quartey refused to sign the
contract for the fight in an attempt to get out of his own deal
with them. Quartey's allies claim the Acarieses won a purse bid for
the bout with no intention of putting it on or paying Quartey the
75 percent of the bid required by WBA regulations.

   Don King filed a $100 million lawsuit against Bob Arum last week
trying to block Chavez's bout with Ken Sigurani at Foxwoods
Thursday. King claims he has a valid contract with Chavez and that
Arum paid Chavez to breach it. This is King's second attempt at
blocking the bout. Meanwhile, Arum has promised Chavez a $250,000
bonus if he can knock out Sigurani in that bout, which is
underneath Buster Douglas-Lou Savarese. The aging Chavez (100-2-2,
83 KOs) is facing a kid who is 22-1 but with no punch, as evidenced
by his eight KOs ... Malden mid-dleweight Dana Rosenblatt was a big
hit at the Carnegie Deli in New York last week. Arum took him there
to promote Rosenblatt's appearance vs. Arthur Allen underneath
Douglas-Savarese. Word is, however, that Rosenblatt ate little of
his pastrami on rye and matzo soup, weight being of bigger concern
to him than a meal ... Friday night, the Boxing Scholarship
Foundation will present the first ``Friday Fight Night at the
Woburn Elks Club'' to help raise funds. The night of amateur boxing
will feature three bouts with senior competitors (over 40) in
addition to a full amateur card. For ticket information, call
Boston Sport Boxing Club at 781-938-8785 or 617-354-3434 ... The
July 12 card at Cape Cod Melody Tent in Hyannis is still on, but
the headliners will be changed. Both Joey DeGrandis and Vernon
Forrest had to withdraw, DeGrandis because of a persistent elbow
problem and Forrest because of sore ribs. Zab Judah, a recent
victor over Lowell's Mickey Ward for the US Boxing Association
junior welterweight title, replaces Forrest in the main event ...
Promoter Jimmy Burchfield has a showdown planned Friday night at
Rhodes-on-the-Pawtuxet in Cranston, R.I., when he pits New England
cruiserweight champion Arthur Saribekian (18-4-1) vs. John
Rainwarter (8-1) in a rematch. Sarbekian Saribekian won a decision
in their first meeting last Oct. 23. For ticket info, call
401-724-2253 ... Worcester's Jose Rivera will fight Vargas Aug. 22
in Atlantic City underneath Gatti and his as-yet-unnamed opponent
... Old friend of boxing Danny Wambolt of Halifax will be inducted
into the World Boxing Hall of Fame in Los Angeles Oct. 18.

ROCKIES BEAT DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Ramon Martinez flew back to Los Angeles on Saturday to
consider his future.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers weren't so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   They were left in the rain at Coors Field, hoping to squeeze
another victory out of their final at-bat and wondering if they can
afford to lose anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   When Eric Karros and Raul Mondesi failed to score the tying run
from second in the ninth, the Dodgers' had their answer. Their 7-6
loss to the Colorado Rockies was coupled with news that Bobby
Bonilla was headed to the disabled list with a viral infection that
might be the reason he has played so poorly since his arriving last
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tough stretch, but we believe in the guys that are
being asked to step up,'' said second baseman Eric Young, who won't
be back until Monday with a strained right thigh. ``We've had to
put out a different team with a lot less experience. But we still
had a chance at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   A victory on the night that first-place San Diego lost for the
first time in 12 games would have been the Dodgers' third straight
and a little bright spot as Martinez tries to decide whether to
have shoulder surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Martinez's replacement Dennis Reyes (0-3), couldn't get
out of the fifth and the Dodgers remain 11{ back.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes allowed a three-run homer to Ellis Burks in the fourth and
was lucky it wasn't worse. Mondesi took a three-run shot away from
Vinny Castilla in the first inning with a leaping catch at the
wall.
</P>
<P>
   But Reyes' erratic performance put pressure on the young Dodgers
lineup that included Paul Konerko at third, Roger Cedeno in left
and Juan Castro at second.
</P>
<P>
   Cedeno had two hits and an RBI, and Castro scored twice. But
Konerko went 0 for 4. Overall, the team had six players on the
roster with a year or less major-league experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we expect them to fill those shoes?'' manager Bill Russell
asked. ``Maybe not every night. But they play hard and they will
keep learning. In this situation, that is all you can ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a game we could have won and almost did.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory went to former Dodgers left-hander Mike Munoz (1-0),
the second of five Rockies relievers to pitch after starter John
Thomson was scratched because of a blister on his right middle
finger.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers actually scored first when Cedeno's third-inning
single scored Castro. But Burks came back in the fourth with a
433-foot drive deep into the left-field bleachers for his 13th
homer.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies built a 7-2 lead in the fifth when they strung
together five consecutive hits with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes struck out the first two batters, leadoff hitter Neifi
Perez and Kurt Abbott. But he was gone after Dante Bichette
singled.
</P>
<P>
   ``He threw 80 pitches and that was what we were looking for,''
Russell said. ``It made some quality pitches and he got hurt,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Bruske came on and got buried. The worst of it was an RBI
single by Burks, a run-scoring double by Greg Colbrunn and a
two-run single by Mike Lansing.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers cut the lead to 7-5 in the seventh with a three-run
double by Karros, who has two homers and nine RBI in the series.
One of the runners was rookie Matt Luke, who had a pinch single off
Curtis Leskanic in his first at-bat since rejoining the club
earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Luke played 33 games for the Dodgers before being designated for
assignment May 29. He was claimed by Cleveland and had two pinch
at-bats before being designated again June 9.
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies went into the ninth with right-hander Jerry DiPoto,
who allowed a game-winning homer to Karros the night before.
</P>
<P>
   The rain that had threatened throughout the game now was falling
steadily.
</P>
<P>
   DiPoto allowed an RBI double to Gary Sheffield and Dave Veres
was brought in to face Karros with the tying run at second.
</P>
<P>
   Karros struck out on a 1-2 off-speed pitch, leaving the game to
Mondesi, who still is a little hobbled by the left ankle he
sprained in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi grounded to short, but Perez's throw beat him by a step.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was close,'' Russell said, ``but it was not our night.''

JONES NEARING HISTORIC TRIPLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KIRBY LEE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Two down, one to go for Marion Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, seeking to become the first woman in 50 years to win the
100, 200 and long jump in the USA Track and Field Championships,
can complete the triple with a triumph today in the 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
   Jones took a big step toward the historic triple Saturday night
at Tad Gormley Stadium, winning the 100 meters in 10.72 seconds and
the long jump with a wind-aided 23 feet, 8 inches. The nine-time
state champion from Thousand Oaks High also won her 200 semifinal
in 22.46 seconds for the top qualifying mark for the final.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long day,'' Jones said. ``I am just glad I could
get through it healthy. I am due for some rest. I was just trying
to get to the finals without killing myself.''
</P>
<P>
   So is John Godina, who became the first man to win the shot put
and discus in 43 years despite competing with torn cartilage in his
right shoulder. Godina, who won the discus late Friday night for
his second consecutive national title, was never challenged in his
quest for his first national shot-put title.
</P>
<P>
   Godina, the two-time world shot-put champion, won with a put of
71-2}. The former UCLA standout's six efforts were 68-10 or better
to outdistance runner-up C.J. Hunter (68-4).
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big thing for me to win the shot-put title, because I
haven't won one yet,'' Godina said. ``That was the most important
thing for me, to get one under my belt.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones started her journey toward the historic triple with a
victory in the 100. Jones got off to a slow start, but her mark was
only a hundredth off her world-leading 10.71 that she ran in Friday
night's semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's mark of 10.72 ranks as the seventh-fastest, trailing
only four marks by Florence Griffith-Joyner, the world record
holder at 10.49, and Jones' two times of 10.71 run this season.
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's 100 final, Inger Miller and Chryste Gaines had the
edge on Jones out of the blocks. Jones, however, assumed command by
the 30-meter mark en route to a comfortable victory. Gaines was
second in 10.89 to become the ninth-fastest American. Miller,
hampered by tendinitis in her knee, was third in 11.12 and Torri
Edwards of USC was fourth in 11.20.
</P>
<P>
   ``Warming up, I didn't feel that hot,'' Jones said. ``I didn't
feel wonderful, but I thought if I ran sub-10.75 there wouldn't be
a problem in winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones took only two of her six attempts in the long jump,
posting her winning leap of 23-8 on her first jump and fouling on
the second before heading off to run in the 200 semifinals. Jones,
the world-leader at 23-11}, still won by more than a foot over
Shana Williams and Dawn Burrell, who were second and third with
identical marks of 22-7.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I landed I felt I had more in me and could have a
better jump, but there was no reason for me to push it,'' said
Jones, who was bothered by cramps Friday from humidity and
temperatures that reached 101 degrees. ``I was going to take my
chances no one would jump better than 23-8.''
</P>
<P>
   Heat and humidity took its toll on 1997 world champion Maurice
Greene and Dennis Mitchell, who scratched from the 100 because of
cramps.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Harden, aided by a gust of 4.9 meters per second, won in
9.88 with Brian Lewis second in 9.98.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA sophomore Seilala Sua, the two time NCAA champion,
unleashed an effort of 204-2 on her sixth and final attempt to win
the women's discus.
</P>
<P>
   Regina Jacobs, the seven-time national 1,500-meter champion, won
her first 5,000 title in 15:32.31. Jacobs, a 1981 graduate of the
Argyll Academy, now known as Campbell Hall, pulled away from Libbie
Hickman in the final quarter to win by more than eight seconds.

BIBBY BRACES FOR BRICKBATS 
 SOME SKEPTICAL OF NBA IMPACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mike Bibby has spent most of his life listening to guys in
striped shirts, knowing they always had the final word. But this
was different. This striped shirt was working at a Foot Locker in a
local mall and was bragging to some of Bibby's friends that he
could take Bibby in a game of one-on-one.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he's 35 years old,'' said the 20-year-old Bibby, who
smiled incredulously at the thought of losing to someone so old, so
close to asking for AARP discounts.
</P>
<P>
   So Bibby, the Arizona All-American, visited the store. ``He
denied he was talking behind my back . . . but asked me if I wanted
to play him one-on-one,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bibby declined, figuring he had nothing to prove. But he finds
it a little humorous, and irritating, that everyone seems to be a
Mike Bibby expert these days.
</P>
<P>
   It is the curse of the young and the talented that people look
intently for wrinkles on faces that are barely past the Clearasil
stage.
</P>
<P>
   It is not familiar territory for Bibby, who has been a phenom
since his early teens, but it's not unexpected, either. The Los
Angeles Clippers are expected to pick Bibby with the first
selection in Wednesday's NBA draft, so the scrutiny of Bibby's
skills is inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   The son of Henry Bibby, the former UCLA and NBA point guard,
Mike Bibby always has seemed destined for greatness. At Shadow
Mountain High School, he set state records for scoring, and the
Matadors won the state championship his senior season.
</P>
<P>
   In his first game at Arizona, he scored 22 points against North
Carolina. He helped the Wildcats to a national championship in his
freshman season. He was a first-team All-American as a sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   His decision to leave college two years early for the NBA looks
wise because even if the Clippers don't take him, he probably will
be among the top five picks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything has been golden for him,'' said Nick Greene, a
close friend and high school teammate.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, there are doubts. Is Bibby ready to play in the
NBA? Can he battle Gary Payton, John Stockton and Jason Kidd and
still help turn around one of the league's worst franchises? Can he
handle the constant questions that will come about his estranged
father, now basketball coach at Southern California, which plays in
the same building as the Clippers, the Los Angeles Sports Arena?
</P>
<P>
   Is he mature enough to handle the lifestyle? The big paycheck?
The scrutiny? The grind of an 82-game schedule?
</P>
<P>
   They are legitimate questions to ask of a kid who became a
father at 19, who has few interests outside of basketball, family,
playing video games and going to the mall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I am prepared for the lifestyle,'' Bibby said. ``But
basketballwise, there are things I'm always going to have to learn.
I think I'll keep learning them as years go by.''
</P>
<P>
   Others wonder. Point guard is probably the toughest position to
play in the NBA, particularly for a rookie who is drafted by a bad
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``His biggest adjustment will be defensively and strengthwise,''
said Rob Babcock, director of player personnel for the Minnesota
Timberwolves. ``I like Mike Bibby very much, but I don't think you
could say at all that he's the consensus No. 1 (pick).''
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts regard this as a weak draft. Players who are now
considered to be top seven picks, including Bibby, would be picked
seventh to 15th in normal years, Babcock said. The 6-foot-2,
194-pound &QL; 
Bibby is regarded as the best point guard in the draft. But he
doesn't have much competition for that honor.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Percudani, Suns director of college scouting, has seen
Bibby play several times over the past two years, and he questions
whether Bibby will be an impact player in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not a downer because I think he will be a very, very
good player,'' Percudani said. ``But I personally thinks he's been
at a plateau in his game for a long time. It's been a good plateau.
He was able to be a starting guard for a team that won a national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest question I would have if I were scouting for a
team with a lottery pick is if there is anybody any better.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is one of value. The Clippers desperately need help
in the backcourt, but would a big man such as Michael Olowokandi, a
7-1 center from Pacific, be a better value?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a hairy problem,'' Percudani said.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers aren't revealing much. General Manager Elgin Baylor
is impressed with Bibby and thought he looked good in a private
workout for the team, but he hasn't committed to taking Bibby.
Having the top pick is not always as easy as selecting Tim Duncan,
as San Antonio did last year.
</P>
<P>
   Percudani said the mind-set of some lottery teams is: ``My god,
you had a horrible year. The organization is going down the tubes,
and we finally got a guy who is No. 1. We know he is a very good
basketball player, but is he going to be an impact player who can
carry us to the next level? Will he became a Kevin Johnson, a Jason
Kidd, a Gary Payton?''
</P>
<P>
   When told of these comments, Bibby gave the appearance of
shrugging them off. But his voice became edgy, his sentences
clipped. He held his tongue, but it was clear he was seething.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's their opinion, and they have a right to it,'' said
Bibby, who then revealed a much thinner skin. ``There are haters
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Haters? Scouts voicing opinions hardly fall into that category.
But Bibby isn't finished. He said he's accustomed to what he sees
as disrespect for his ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be people, I'll go places and they'll give me dirty
looks. I dealt with it in high school. I dealt with it in college,
and I'll deal with it in the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   He is not worried, he said, about competing with the Paytons,
the Stocktons and the Kidds. He is not worried about his ability to
run a team, to make his teammates better, to handle the pressure.
He thinks he'll reward the general manager who puts a basketball,
and a team, in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what I'm used to,'' he said. ``I've been doing this for
so many years. I made a bet with somebody that any team I got to
will make it to the playoffs, so I have to back it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Those close to Bibby have no doubts that he will succeed in the
NBA. Members of the Arizona coaching staff said they never have had
anyone work harder. From the day he set foot on campus, Bibby spent
nearly every day working on his game. Even after three-hour
practices, he and roommate Josh Pastner worked through various
shooting drills.
</P>
<P>
   After this season ended, Bibby and Pastner still awoke at 5 a.m.
just so they could be the first ones in the gym.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just makes it look so easy,'' Pastner said. ``He is so
smooth with his ball handling, it just looks effortless. I think
most people don't realize the hours and hours of sweat that he's
put in to achieve what he's gotten.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona assistant coach Jim Rosborough bristled when told that
some people think Bibby hasn't improved much over the past two
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took his game to whatever level he needed to at the time,''
Rosborough said. ``Could we have had him score more? Sure. Could we
have highlighted him more? Sure. All Mike did was make the other
guys look better. I think the kid is going to do nothing but get
better. Now, how is he going to do in his first game against Kidd?
Against Payton? Probably get schooled. But in a normal maturation
time frame, he's going to be as good as anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Royce Youree, a veteran high school and college coach, coached
Bibby in a summer league a few years ago and agrees with
Rosborough.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has such a mature mind about him,'' said Youree, now a
scout with the Atlanta Hawks. ``He has a very innate idea of what's
going on on the court. He has a great ability to get the ball to
the right person at the right time at the right place. That's
probably his best skill.''
</P>
<P>
   Many people question the NBA's future once Michael Jordan
retires. The younger players, they say, are selfish people whose
skills are more suited to pickup games and whose behavior is
reprehensible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had the chance to work with more high picks than probably
anyone else in the country over the last 25 years,'' said agent
David Falk, who represents Jordan, Patrick Ewing and now Bibby.
``Michael Jordan, where do you go from there? But when I meet
certain young players, it re-energizes me. (Bibby) is wholesome and
has good family values. He's polite, humble and obviously
tremendously talented.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosborough thinks the NBA eventually will need a player such as
Bibby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the kid has a magical name,'' Rosborough said. ``He
has that magical quality, that little-boy quality that you see in
Jordan. Mike could be the guy that just by playing well might step
into that void. He's a squeaky-clean kid. The question now is with
the total media scrutiny, how will he handle that?''
</P>
<P>
   That's where Bibby is most uncomfortable. At Arizona, he often
slipped out after a game to avoid reporters. And he has been known
to conduct interviews while never looking up from a magazine to
make eye contact with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said he doesn't mind the attention, he said, unless it
gets personal. Since high school, he has been asked constantly
about his father, with whom he has no relationship. For the past
few years, he has refused to answer questions about his dad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel it's my business, and it doesn't need to be in the
paper for everybody to read,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Through a USC spokesman, Henry Bibby declined to talk about his
son.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Bibby has been criticized by some for fathering a child out
of wedlock, which he thinks is unfair. On the court, he can
retaliate for perceived slights by making plays. Off the court, he
has little power to fight the criticism, and that's something
that's difficult for a 20-year-old to accept.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I went out and found some girl and impregnated
her,'' Bibby said. ``I had a girlfriend, and we decided to have a
baby.''
</P>
<P>
   He and his girlfriend, whom he declines to name, are together,
and Bibby spends considerable time with his son, Michael Dane, who
was born in December.
</P>
<P>
   He knows people behind his back joke that Bibby will fit in
perfectly in the NBA, where many players have fathered children out
of wedlock. He has been lumped in with other athletes, such as
Latrell Sprewell, as an example of today's spoiled athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things don't usually bother him, but that bothered him,'' said
his mother, Virginia. ``He couldn't understand how you could look
at that (fathering a child) as something bad. But he has to take
that kind of criticism, too. If that's how people want to look at
that, you have to deal with it. ''
</P>
<P>
   Like her son, Virginia Bibby declines to talk about Henry,
saying only that ``the problem with the kids and their father, it's
not because he wasn't there. It goes so much deeper.''
</P>
<P>
   Bibby and his mother are extremely close, but she doesn't pamper
him constantly. Recently, a reporter had an interview scheduled
with Bibby, who seemed more interested in working out. But his
mother told him emphatically that he was going to do it. And he
did.
</P>
<P>
   She also doesn't think her son deserves applause for accepting
the responsibility of fatherhood and spending time with his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should,'' she said. ``If he got to that point, he should.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone close to Bibby raves about the job his mother did in
raising him. He is unfailingly polite to strangers and never
declined an autograph request at Arizona, where Wildcats players
are the most recognized people in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could tell you how I feel,'' Virginia said of Mike.
``I look at it as the Lord has already did this. I was just a tool.
That's it, I was just a tool.''
</P>
<P>
   Following Falk's advice, the Clippers are the only team Bibby
has visited in the weeks preceding the draft. Clippers officials
aren't saying much about their draft intentions and are rumored to
be interested in trading the pick. There is also speculation they
might draft Olowokandi, especially if they fear losing center Isaac
Austin through free agency.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, Bibby could drop a few spots. He said it doesn't
matter to him. If it happens, then he'll have something to prove to
the Clippers, as well as to the guy at Foot Locker.
</P>
<P>
   Pastner doesn't like the shoe guy's chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always challenge him one-on-one, and I haven't beaten him
yet,'' he said. &QL;

DIPLOMACY NEEDS TO BE BIG WINNER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LYON, France _ In simpler times, a demonstration was what a
door-to-door vacuum cleaner salesman offered to give the lady of
the house.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrations are something else in politics, and soccer. Like
a French braid, the two are entwined.
</P>
<P>
   Iran plays the United States today in the ``Coupe du Monde,'' as
the hosts like to say. If the Americans win, they will breathe a
sigh of relief. If Iran wins, it's party time.
</P>
<P>
   In Tehran, there would be dancing, singing, weeping. The
explosion of national pride might rival the scene that erupted in
November after Iran, playing in Melbourne, Australia, qualified for
the World Cup for the first time in 20 years. In a passionate
outpouring, 2 million citizens _ including 5,000 women who ignored
police instructions to stay home _ filled the streets. Women ripped
off their government-mandated veils. When the team returned home,
Iranians welcomed them, packing 120,000-seat Azadi stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team, of course, hopes to prevent a day (or days) of
rapturous glee.
</P>
<P>
   In this regard, Coach Steve Sampson might confer with the famous
American diplomat and motivationalist, Charles Barkley. Before Game
5 of the 1993 NBA Finals, the Phoenix Suns faced elimination.
Chicago police braced for a rowdy celebration. The Bulls won the
title, but lost Game 5, at home, the night Barkley wrote the
playful pre-game message _ ``SAVE THE CITY!'' on the Suns
chalkboard.
</P>
<P>
   Iran vs. the USA is bigger, of course.
</P>
<P>
   This is more than a game of kickball. After two decades of
hostilities between Iran and the West, President Clinton expressed
his hope for a ``genuine reconciliation'' with Tehran. So did
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. Perhaps one step toward that
goal can be achieved through sportsmanship and soccer diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   Few Iranian players appear to regard the American team as an
emissary of the Great Satan. Their coach, Jalal Talebi, spent 17
years in the United States. A kind, soft-spoken man, Talebi
sometimes answers even Persian questions in fluent English. He
would make an excellent ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   Most American players are too young to remember the hostage
crisis in Iran almost 20 years ago. To a man, they repeat the
it's-just-another-big-game quote, and downplay the political
overtones.
</P>
<P>
   Last week a French television channel screened ``Not Without My
Daughter,'' a true-story film about an American woman's attempt to
reclaim her daughter from her cruel Iranian husband. Iran's
ambassador to French became overheated and threatened to take the
team home. One Iranian player, Ali Reza Mansourian, claimed the
film had ``weakened the morale of the Iranian soccer players.''
</P>
<P>
   Team USA's reaction? Alexei Lalas, whose nanny-goat chin
whiskers give him the appearance of a young red-haired Uncle Sam,
said, ``It's just a ``movie,'' man.''
</P>
<P>
   But this is isn't just the next game. The world's most popular
sporting event has given Iran a major place on an international
stage for the first time since the revolution led by Ayatollah
Khomenei overthrew the Shah in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Iranians have the opportunity to show themselves as sportsmen
and fans, not as terrorists and religious fanatics, which is how
they are perceived in the West.
</P>
<P>
   How the teams conduct themselves on the field will be worth
watching, and millions will. With both countries facing certain
elimination in the first round if they lose, the contest will not
be a ``friendly,'' the soccer term for exhibition matches.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson has demanded his team play more aggressively than it did
in a 2-0 loss to Germany. ``We have to attack and defend, and
attack with vigor,'' he said, sounding like a military man. The
match, he predicted, will be fierce, physical.
</P>
<P>
   To insure impartiality, the game will be officiated by a Swiss
referee.
</P>
<P>
   Iran was the last team to qualify for the World Cup. The
Iranians don't have the size or speed or skills of the German team.
The U.S. expects to win. ``We ``have'' to win,'' Lalas said,
referring not to the politics but the three points awarded for a
victory.
</P>
<P>
   Win, lose or honorable tie, U.S. players plan to shake hands
with the Iranians afterward. Several said they hope to exchange
gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Better T-shirts than arms and hostages. &QL;

TEEN PHENOM SURE BET AS NO. 1 PICK IN NHL DRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last time the NHL held its annual entry draft in Buffalo,
the clear-cut No. 1 prospect was a bullish young teenager named
Eric Lindros.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years later, as the draft returns to upstate New York,
another physical center with Lindros-like proportions has emerged
as hockey's most coveted choice.
</P>
<P>
   He might not turn out to be the next Lindros, however.
</P>
<P>
   Vincent Lecavalier might be better.
</P>
<P>
   `This kid is going to be around for a long, long time,'' said
Bill Lesuk, the director of scouting for the Coyotes. `He's a
potential superstar.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-4, 180-pound Lecavalier is the top-rated prospect
entering Saturday's draft at Buffalo's Marine Midland Arena,
according to final rankings released last month by the Central
Scouting Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   In 58 games last season for Rimouski Oceananic in the Quebec
junior league, Lecavalier racked up 44 goals and 115 points along
with 117 penalty minutes. Central Scouting gave him grades of 10s
in hockey sense and puck-handling, nine in competitiveness, and
eights in skating, checking and physical play.
</P>
<P>
   Lesuk and the Coyotes would love to have him. But Lecavalier
will be long gone by the time Phoenix makes its first pick with the
14th overall selection.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Coyotes make their third major trade in two weeks, of
course, and ship out yet another core player for the rights to the
shining, can't-miss 18-year-old. The team recently traded top-line
center Craig Janney and popular enforcer Jim McKenzie. But don't
count on seeing Lecavalier in a Coyotes sweater.
</P>
<P>
   As sure as Joe Thornton was bound for Boston as last year's
consensus No. 1 pick, Lecavalier is headed for Tampa Bay, which
maneuvered itself into grabbing the first pick after it changed
hands from Florida to San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers gave it to the Sharks last November for Viktor
Kozlov. Originally the No. 3 pick at the time, it became the No. 1
pick when San Jose won the draft lottery in May. The Sharks,
though, sent it to the Lightning, in part, for Bryan Marchment.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose will still make out on Saturday. The Sharks hold the
No. 2 pick and will be overjoyed at drafting the other top center
in the field, David Legwand of Gross Pointe, Mich., if Lecavalier
goes to Tampa as expected. Legwand, who is 6-1{ and 175 pounds,
scored 10 more goals than Lecavalier did last season, netting 54
and 105 points for Plymouth in the Ontario League.
</P>
<P>
   Many scouts have the two rated evenly. Central Scouting gave
Legwand 10s in skating, hockey sense and puckhandling and an eight
in competitiveness. He drew only sixes in checking and physical
play, but he's being compared to Mike Modano of the Dallas Stars,
the No. 1 pick in the 1988 draft.
</P>
<P>
   `If we were going to chose, it would go right down to the
wire,'' Lesuk s aid. `It would depend on what sort of team you want
to build. But both of them are dynamite, for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   One scout said Legwand will be a franchise player and
consistently rank among the NHL's top 10 in scoring by the time he
is 24. Others have made similar remarks, which doesn't sit well
with Lecavalier.
</P>
<P>
   `Personally, I've heard enough of hearing that David Legwand has
caught up or even passed me,'' Lecavalier told the ``Toronto Sun.''
`He hasn't had any pressure. As far as I know, the NHL still rates
me No. 1. I'm not ready to give up that honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Central Scouting should have given him a 10 for self-confidence,
too.
</P>
<P>
   The Bureau rates Oshawa defenseman Bryan Allen (6-4{, 208
pounds) as the third-best prospect, followed by Regina defenseman
Brad Stuart (6-2{, 215), Barrie right wing Michael Henrich (6-2,
206), Guelph center Manny Malhotra (6-1{, 210), Shawinigan
defenseman Mathieu Biron (6-6{, 210), Barrie defenseman Martin
Skoula (6-2, 195) and London center Rico Fata (6-0, 202).
</P>
<P>
   The expansion Nashville Predators, who begin play next season
and will raid each of the existing 26 NHL teams by taking at least
one player from every club in Friday's expansion draft, pick third
overall. They are followed, in order, by Vancouver, Anaheim,
Calgary and the New York Rangers. Toronto, the New York Islanders
and Chicago round out the top 10.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina picks 11th, Colorado 12th with the first of four
first-round picks, and Edmonton is 13th. Then, it's up to the
Coyotes, who lost their first-round pick last year in the Jeremy
Roenick trade with the Blackhawks. Phoenix's first pick last year
was second-rounder Juha Gustafsson, a defenseman from Finland.
</P>
<P>
   Although this year's draft class isn't seen as very deep after
the first handful of picks, Phoenix should find itself a solid
prospect at No. 14 to fit any one of its four or five major needs:
a goal-scoring left winger to eventually complement Keith Tkachuk;
a speedy top-line right wing who can finish; a capable goalie who
can fill a backup role within two to three years; and both an
offensive and defensive defenseman.
</P>
<P>
   Fata, who scored 43 goals and 76 points, might fall to them at
that spot. But if 6-2, 195-pound left wing Ramzi Abid is still on
the board, he might be too hard to pass up. Rated as the 11th-best
prospect by Central Scouting, he led the Quebec league in scoring
with 50 goals, 85 assists and 135 points in 68 games. He also
posted Tkachuk-like numbers in the penalty box _ 266 minutes in
all.
</P>
<P>
   `He wound up having a great year,'' Lesuk said. `There's a lot
of positives to work with there, for sure. He'll end up being a
good pro for a number of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Abid is Tunisian by descent but was born in Montreal. The only
thing that scares some scouts away from him is his skating, which
has been ranked at a five on a scale to 10. Tkachuk's wheels
wouldn't rate much better, but it's the overall game that counts
most. And remember, Abid's a left winger, too.
</P>
<P>
   Czech defenseman Jiri Fischer (6-5{, 210) might be tough for the
Coyotes to pass up if he's still available. Ditto with 6-3 Ottawa
center Mark Bell, who scored 34 goals and has been compared to a
young Bobby Smith by his juniors coach, Brian Kilrea, who also
coached Smith, it should be noted.
</P>
<P>
   `He's a good player every organization would like to have,''
Lesuk said o f Bell. `He fits in our range and, yes, there's
consideration there.''
</P>
<P>
   The top goalie prospect is Patrick DesRochers, a 6-3{,
195-pounder who went 26-17-11 with a respectable 3.35 goals-against
average for Sarnia in the Ontario league.

BRIGHT LIGHTS DULL TO MCGWIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ If batting practice is becoming a distraction to
Mark McGwire, what will happen if he's sitting at 55 home runs with
a full month remaining in the season?
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has never been completely comfortable with the attention
he's received from playing major league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, not everyone who plays this game gets the same
reception. In today's game, McGwire is an unrivaled home- run
hitter. The very best in his field and quite possibly the best
ever.
</P>
<P>
   He has hit a home run every 11.54 at-bats, better than anyone in
the history of the game, including Babe Ruth, who is next at 11.76.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's sluggers have always lived in a specially reserved
loft, receiving far more attention than anyone else in the game
because they can consistently accomplish the most difficult feat in
the game _ hitting the ball over the fence.
</P>
<P>
   So when the rare ones come along, the type who hit them farther
than anyone else ever has, the attention dial is turned up
considerably. McGwire knows very well what will happen if he gets
within striking distance of Roger Maris' single-season home run
record of 61.
</P>
<P>
   The media circus will descend upon him to the point where he
will feel smothered. McGwire said he felt stifled last week when
the Cardinals came to Bank One Ballpark and then to Houston, cities
where he had never before played.
</P>
<P>
   The batting practice phenomena, he said, was out of control to
the point where he felt like a ``caged lion.'' He could not believe
a Phoenix radio station did play-by-play for his batting practice
session before the opening game of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll get under control,'' McGwire said. ``It has to. It's
getting out of hand. I won't let it become a circus.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the same freckle-faced kid who came out of Southern
California and was blown away when reporters constantly wanted to
talk to him during his first year in the majors in 1987, when
McGwire shattered the rookie record for home runs with 49.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I just don't get it,'' McGwire said of the batting
practice sideshows that have become routine. ``I'm not doing
anything different than I have for years.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's where McGwire is wrong. He's now playing in a city
that appreciates and recognizes greatness, not what's become the
wasteland in Oakland, where he spent his first 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cardinals fans alerted the world to this part of the show,''
St. Louis Manager Tony La Russa said. ``I think that has everything
to do with it. They started making noise and everyone wanted to see
what they were talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   During his first years in the majors, one of McGwire's biggest
problems was his reluctance to say no to most requests. His mother
and father, both of whom are in St. Louis this weekend, taught
McGwire and his three brothers to be respectful of others.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire has learned to say no, both to reporters and fans. He's
had to. He is still one of the most accommodating superstars in the
game, a trait that has made him one of the most well-liked athletes
in sports.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, McGwire has probably shattered some fans'
perception of him. But it's never been spiteful or malicious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he'll be just fine if it gets to the point where he's
close to Maris,'' La Russa said. ``Deep down he knows all this
attention is good for the game. And Mark has always put the game
ahead of himself. That's why he won't back out of the home run
contest at the All-Star Game.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals haven't played half their games yet and McGwire
already has 33 home runs. Most major dailies, including ``The
Republic,'' have begin running some sort of McGwire countdown box.
The ``St. Louis Post Dispatch'' runs its countdown with the
masthead on the cover of the sports section.
</P>
<P>
   The spotlight will become brighter during the All-Star Game
festivities, where tickets to the home run-hitting contest might
become a tougher ticket than the game on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is no zoo animal. He is, however, the greatest spectacle
in the game today. Just remember, he is human. &QL;

D-BACKS SUFFER ST. LOUIS BLUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The Diamondbacks, full of life after a three-game
sweep of the Reds in Cincinnati, appear to be falling back into a
rut against the St. Louis Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Their bullpen unraveled, and when their hitters were given the
opportunity to help the Cardinals' bullpen come apart at the seams,
they couldn't get the job done.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a second straight loss, 4-2, on Saturday night in
front of a sellout crowd at Busch Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Despite giving up four walks and three hits, right-hander Amaury
Telemaco managed to play Houdini and escape trouble to hold the
Cardinals scoreless in his first start as a Diamondback.
</P>
<P>
   He had a 1-0 lead, in fact, thanks to a bloop ground-rule RBI
double by Karim Garcia in the fourth inning. The hit came off
right-hander Manny Aybar, making the start in place of injured
left-hander Kent Mercker.
</P>
<P>
   The lead could have been bigger. Jay Bell and Garcia were
stranded at third and second, respectively, when Kelly Stinnett
fouled out to end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   And, the Diamondbacks probably should have scored in the second
inning. Instead of waiting for a chance for Stinnett or Telemaco to
drive in Bell, who had singled and moved to third on left fielder
Ron Gant's error, Manager Buck Showalter sent Bell toward the plate
as Garcia made contact. Bell was easily thrown out by Cardinals
shortstop Royce Clayton.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Willie Banks took over for Telemaco in the fifth
and challenged the Cardinals' 2-3-4 hitters, getting Delino
DeShields on a comebacker to the mound and striking out Mark
McGwire and Brian Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   But in the sixth, Banks wasn't the same pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   He surrendered singles to the first two batters, Ray Lankford
and Willie McGee, and those two men later scored _ Lankford on a
groundout by Tom Lampkin and McGee on a bases-loaded walk to
DeShields.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Clint Sodowsky came in to face McGwire, and got him
on the first pitch on a fielder's-choice grounder.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks' biggest opportunity came in the seventh, when
Bell led off with a single and Stinnett and pinch-hitter Yamil
Benitez walked to load the bases against right-handed reliever John
Frascatore.
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals Manager Tony La Russa then called upon left-hander
Lance Painter, who struck out pinch-hitter Tony Batista and got
Devon White on a fielder's-choice grounder.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona was still in it, but not for long.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter went to right-hander Felix Rodriguez in the seventh,
but he gave up a leadoff single to Jordan and a two-run homer to
Lankford for a 4-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Stinnett, who homered in the Diamondbacks' previous visit here
in mid-April, hit a one-out solo shot, his sixth of the season, off
right-hander Rick Croushore in the ninth. But it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   Croushore struck out pinch-hitter Mike Robertson and got Batista
on a comebacker to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   The loss left the Diamondbacks record to 25-49 entering today's
finale of the three-game series. The Cardinals reached .500 at
36-36.
</P>
<P>
   ``We struck out too much (seven times) and we couldn't put the
ball in play in key situations,'' Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   Of sending Bell in the second, Showalter said, ``We had Stinnett
coming up, but they would have walked him to get to Telemaco, so we
felt we had to take a pop at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter said Telemaco was to have been limited to between 60
and 70 pitches, but was allowed to go to 74. Showalter was mildly
pleased, and said Telemaco had earned another start, which will
come in an interleague game against Texas on Thursday at Bank One
Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to give my team a chance to win. I think I did
that, but I can do a lot better,'' Telemaco said. ``I got behind in
the count when I shouldn't have. Starting is a different role with
different preparations. I'm confident I can move on from here.''

   (NOTE: Because of the complicated figuring involved, you are
requested to use these Best Sellers lists in full or not at all.
This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,
and Miscellaneous'' listings were separated from the non-fiction
list for important reasons, and not to print ``Advice, How-To, and
Miscellaneous'' gives an impression that is incorrect, resulting in
criticism from publishing houses.)
</P>
<P>
   Rankings reflect sales figures for the week ending June 13,
1998, at almost 4,000 bookstores plus wholesalers serving 60,000
other retailers, statistically weighted to represent sales in all
such outlets nationwide. The number of titles within the two
subdivisions of non-fiction can change from week to week,
reflecting changes in book buying.

<P>
   An (x) following a book's ranking indicates that a book's sales
are barely distinguishable from those of the book above. A (b)

by the author of `` &UR; THE ALIENIST &LR; ,'' this time to track down a
serial murderer of young children in turn-of-the-century Manhattan.
Last year our reviewer, Ben Macintyre, called this ``a ripping yarn
told with verve, intensity, and a feel for historical detail.''

<P>
   &UR; A HISTORY OF THE BREAST &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Marilyn Yalom. Ballantine, $14.95.
</P>
<P>
   This provocative analysis of cultural and artistic attitudes
toward womankind's most symbolically freighted body part explores
the rich array of sacred, maternal, erotic, and political
perceptions of the breast through the centuries. There is a
surprising amount to discuss, from Stone Age artifacts to the
evolution of women's underwear to modern performance art. ``Yalom's
stately romp through history is variously enlightening, amusing,
and enraging,'' Natalie Angier wrote in the Book Review in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; READ THIS AND TELL ME WHAT IT SAYS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A. Manette Ansay. Bard/Avon, $11.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the rural Midwest, these 15 tales focus on ordinary
people and the modest epiphanies that make give meaning to life.
The stories ``map the distances between ourselves and other
worlds,'' Jonis Agee said here in 1995. ``They remind us of how
necessary our dreams and desires are to the fragile lives we piece
together.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE UNIVERSE BELOW: DISCOVERING THE SECRETS OF THE DEEP SEA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By William J. Broad. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $15.
</P>
<P>
   The author, a science reporter for The New York Times, combines
personal experience with scientific and historical research to
provide ``a readable and reliable guide'' to deep-sea exploration
and exploitation, John Durant wrote in these pages last year.  &UR; IN
DARWIN'S DREAMPOND: DRAMA IN LAKE VICTORIA &LR; , by Tijs Goldschmidt
(translated by Sherry Marx-Macdonald, MIT, $15), a Dutch fish
taxonomist describes how the introduction of the predatory Nile
perch doomed most of the African lake's dazzling native population.
This literate account ``stands head and shoulders above the
predictable genre of eco-gloomies,'' Mark Ridley said here in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TERMINAL VELOCITY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Blanche McCrary Boyd. Vintage Contemporaries, $12.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, a prim book editor dumps her heterosexual life in
Boston to take up with a band of radical lesbians in a California
commune called Red Moon Rising. The author of this dizzying novel
about the search for the self has ``a voice that never wavers in
its authority or its fierce sexual politics,'' our reviewer, Andrea
Barnet, wrote in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; JOHN WAYNE'S AMERICA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Garry Wills. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $14.
</P>
<P>
   A polymath extraordinaire, in deconstructing the symbol of
manhood for generations of Americans in an often unsettling feat of
revisionism, seeks to rescue Wayne from both his idolaters and his
detractors. ``I hope this new book will find its way into the hands
of those who are ready to think seriously about a pivotal figure in
our culture, a figure who was a great star and a flawed man,''
Molly Haskell said last year in these pages.  &UR; LIGHTING OUT FOR THE
TERRITORY: REFLECTIONS ON MARK TWAIN AND AMERICAN CULTURE &LR; , by
Shelley Fisher Fishkin (Oxford, $13.95), maps the literary and
moral legacy of another iconic figure, focusing in particular on
the writer's true feelings about race and slavery. This ``is an
illuminating companion to any consideration of Twain's work,''
David Walton wrote here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE WHITE CASTLE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Orhan Pamuk. Translated by Victoria Holbrook. Vintage
International, $12.
</P>
<P>
   In a canny metaphysical novel that explores the limits of
identity, an Italian scholar becomes a slave to a scientist in
17th-century Istanbul who appears to be his double. The Turkish
author ``is a storyteller with as much gumption and narrative zip
as Scheherazade,'' Jay Parini said here in 1991. The same publisher
has issued Pamuk's most recent novel,  &UR; THE NEW LIFE &LR;  (translated by
Guneli Gun, $13), in which a young student embarks on a surreal bus
journey with a mysterious woman after being magically transformed
by a book. Last year our reviewer, D.M. Thomas, found the story to
be too disconnected from reality, but called it ``a skillful play
of illusions.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HOW PROUST CAN CHANGE YOUR LIFE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Alain de Botton. Vintage International, $12.
</P>
<P>
   A clever nine-step program drawing lessons from the life and
literature of Marcel Proust shows how `` &UR; REMEMBRANCE OF THINGS
PAST &LR; '' can make you a better person. The result is an ``enormously
entertaining ... self-help manual for the intelligent person,''
Frank Gannon wrote in the Book Review in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DANGEROUS ANGELS: THE WEETZIE BAT BOOKS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Francesca Lia Block. Harpercollins, $12.
</P>
<P>
   These five dreamlike fables, which share an offbeat cast of
characters and a freewheeling narrative sprawl, have found a
natural following among young adults. In reviewing the first book,
``Weetzie Bat,'' in 1989, Betsy Hearne said ``the language is
inventive Californian hip, but ... the theme is transcendent.''

STEWART PAYS TOLL TO RETAIN U.S. OPEN LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANGELO BRUSCAS  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Playing and dressing as if he were on another
planet, Payne Stewart continued to set himself apart from the field
at the U.S. Open Friday in a style that was all his own.
</P>
<P>
   He hit a cyprus tree and made birdie. He buried a few balls in
the unkempt rough and slapped another into the grandstand and still
salvaged pars. He bent putts across double-sloped greens and danced
like he was at a Greatful Dead Concert when they lipped the cup and
dropped in.
</P>
<P>
   But then the unreality and gravity of the Olympic Club Lake
Course finally began to exact its toll. Holding a five-stroke lead
at one point, Stewart slipped from 7-under to 3-under on the back
nine, capped by one of the strangest birdie attempts ever witnessed
by Stewart or anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting pin-high with eight feet to go for a four-stroke lead,
Stewart's birdie try on 18 slipped around the hole, gently rolled
at an angle down the severe slope of the green and didn't stop
until he had a 25-footer coming back uphill. He missed, made bogey
and then ran up to the clubhouse with a slim one-stroke lead over
Jeff Maggert and Bob Tway.
</P>
<P>
   Putt-putt greens are more forgiving, and Stewart immediately
complained about the pin placement to the United States Golf
Association marshal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do expect to walk off there with a par,'' Stewart said of
the mystifying putt on 18. ``I thought it was going to stop two
feet from the hole, and the rest is history.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearing his trademark plaid knickers and jaunty red cap, Stewart
certainly could not be mistaken for someone who was ready to
tighten up like the rest of the first-round leaders at the fabled
course. But the putt on 18 put a damper on his good vibrations,
which began with three straight birdies.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart declared the pin placement on 18 to be ``almost
illegal'' and ``bordering on the ridiculous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching the Putt-Putt Championship on ESPN before I
started the round, and it resembles that a lot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Washington state native Kirk Triplett had a similar putt not
long after Stewart's, and he stopped the ball from rolling back
with his putter _ an infraction that cost him a two-stroke penalty
and put him well out of contention to make the cut.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the last frustration of a frustrating day,'' Triplett
said of his action. Had he made the cut, the USGA likely would have
disqualified him.
</P>
<P>
   On the more normal side of the spectrum, the day also belonged
to button-downed 19-year-old U.S. Amateur champ Matt Kuchar, who
had four birdies to go with one bogey, a double bogey and the rest
pars to finish the first two rounds at 1-under.
</P>
<P>
   Kuchar, the Georgia Tech junior-to-be who captivated crowds with
his 21st-place finish at the Masters, served notice that he's no
fluke.
</P>
<P>
   With fans calling out, ``Go Kooch,'' his gallery seemed to pay
no attention to the fact that he was playing with defending Open
champ Ernie Els and British Open champ Justin Leonard. If the
new-found adulation and success took some getting used to, Kuchar
wasn't showing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if you ever get used to it,'' Kuchar said. ``The
feeling that you get playing golf is different than anything _ the
nervousness and just the feeling of being in contention, especially
here at a major championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Kuchar was tied for third place with little-known Lee Porter and
Lee Janzen, whose 4-under-par 66 was the low score of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Porter, of Greensboro, N.C., has spent as much time on the Asian
Tour as he has playing on the PGA Tour but managed to qualify for
his first Open this year. He capped his round with a 112-yard
pitching wedge shot for eagle on the par-4 18th, a shot he counts
among the most memorable of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't think of a better way to end,'' he said,
admitting he was more relieved to make the cut than to be only two
strokes off the lead.
</P>
<P>
   Maggert could understand Stewart's frustrations on a course in
which only four players have managed to break par over 72 holes in
three previous Opens held here in 1955, 1966 and 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pretty much figured the course was going to play like
this,'' Maggert said after shooting consecutive 69s. ``It played
tough in 1987. Just the way the USGA sets it up, I figured that if
I can shoot under par for four days here, I am going to be right
there near the lead.''
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the short but topsy-turvy and tree-lined Lake
Course took its toll on a number of players who were flirting with
the leaderboard on Thursday. Darkhorse Mark Carnevale, who started
Friday's round in second place at 3-under, double-bogeyed the
394-yard par-4 second hole and then bogeyed No. 4 to slip to even
par. The second hole also claimed Joe Durant, who had been tied
with Carnevale going into Friday's round, and the 10-year
journeyman pro from Pensacola, Fla., fell to 1-over by the end of
the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe it or not, I feel like I played better tee to green
today,'' Durant said. ``I just didn't make the putts I made
yesterday.''
</P>
<P>
   Course conditions also claimed many of the 20-something stars
who were counted on to do well in this Open.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard, picked as one of the favorites to win the tournament in
a pre-Open poll, shot 75 to go with an opening round 71 and didn't
like being upstaged by the likes of Kuchar.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't do anything very well today,'' Leonard said in a
terse post-round interview.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Couples just barely made the cut after a 5-over 75 Friday
to put him at 147 for the tournament, as did 58-year-old Jack
Nicklaus, playing in his 42nd Open. Nicklaus, who got a special
exemption just to make the original field, needed a 50-foot birdie
putt on 18 to stay alive. Tiger Woods and Leonard also flirted with
elimination at 6-over 146, and Casey Martin qualified, one stroke
ahead of them. The list of those who headed home last night
included 1997 PGA champion Davis Love III, 1996 Open champ Steve
Jones, 1995 Open champ Corey Pavin, Tom Watson, Nick Faldo and
Fuzzy Zoeller.
</P>
<P>
   Even when things were going well, Stewart knew his lead could be
squandered, given the severity of the Lake Course.
</P>
<P>
   ``It comes back. You know, everything comes back, and in this
championship something right around par is going to be a hell of a
golf score,'' he said.

   CLINTON-TRIP-1STLEDE _ When he visits China beginning next week,
virtually everything President Clinton does _ every step he takes,
every place he goes, every bite he eats _ will have been
choreographed weeks in advance by a horde of advance men and women
who will have scheduled every second of his trip. After spending
hours studying videotapes of the routes Clinton will take, Secret
Service agents will have ensured that manhole covers are sealed and
air ducts blocked to prevent potential assassins from planting
bombs. His armor-plated limousine will have been flown ahead.
Hotels will have been comandeered for the president and his
entourage. Detailed briefing books will have been prepared for him,
providing classified information on the ranking officials with whom
he will meet. Phone banks will have been put in place for the
traveling White House press. Sophisticated electronics gear will
have been installed so the media can beam images back to the United
States. In all, hundreds of advance people will have worked around
the clock and millions of tax dollars will have been spent to make
sure the whole thing goes off without a hitch. (Deans, Cox News

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By setting aside tobacco legislation that would
have increased costs for smokers, the Senate cleared the way last
week to consider a bill that will raise the ante for people whose
debts are driving them into bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the tobacco debate, which barely touched on smokers'
responsibility for their habits, the debate over tightening
bankruptcy rules is likely to focus on consumers' responsibility
for paying their bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time a deadbeat does not pay his bills, that means
working people have to pay more'' for consumer goods, mortgages and
other credit, said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who passionately
supports making bankruptcy proceedings more difficult for people
who can pay part of their debts.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm and other reform-minded lawmakers are reacting to
bankruptcy filings that have hit highs not seen since the collapse
of the real estate market and savings &AMP; loans in the last half of
the 1980s. With no similar economic crisis to explain the current
spike in bankruptcy filings, some lawmakers are pointing their
fingers at the debtors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something is wrong when we have record prosperity and record
numbers of bankruptcy,'' Gramm said.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates, in turn, are pointing fingers at banks and
retailers that are marketing credit cards at unprecedented rates.
University of Texas law professor Jay Westbrook, a bankruptcy law
specialist, prepared for a recent speech in Austin by collecting
eight days' worth of credit offers that he and his wife received in
the mail. The total hit $600,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was stunned,'' said Westbrook, who joined 60 other
bankruptcy law professors in a letter urging Congress to slow its
reform efforts. The professors _ including two from Emory
University; one from Georgia State University; one from Ohio State
University, and one from Florida State University _ don't oppose
bankruptcy reform, but they said ``the study of its consequences
(was) superficial.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Aside from the tax code and the Social Security laws, no other
federal law affects more Americans,'' the letter said. ``We believe
that the current debate is ill-considered, rushed and unbalanced.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the professors' concern, Congress has moved at
uncharacteristic speed to change the rules governing the levels of
relief available to people with crushing debts. The House approved
its package of changes June 10 in a 306-118 vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is expected to take up its version of bankruptcy
reform in mid-July, after a 2 1/2 week recess for the July 4
holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The main goal of both the House and Senate bills is to restrict
debtors' use of a section of the U.S. bankruptcy code known as
Chapter 7, under which individuals and married couples declare an
inability to pay debts and effectively have most of them canceled,
or discharged.
</P>
<P>
   Some personal debts _ such as income taxes, child support,
alimony, student loans and court judgments for fraud or injury to
another person _ are considered priority debts and must be paid in
full under both Chapter 7 and its alternative, Chapter 13.
</P>
<P>
   Under Chapter 13, individuals and couples reorganize their debts
and repay part of them under a plan approved by the bankruptcy
court. Chapter 13 is the personal version of Chapter 11, which is
used by corporations to reorganize debt.
</P>
<P>
   Both forms of personal bankruptcy contain allowances for debtors
to retain some personal property, such as items necessary for
income and, to varying degrees, a home. States traditionally have
set the rules for the value of the personal property and homes.
</P>
<P>
   Some states, such as Texas and Florida, set no limit on the
value of the homestead, which led to headline-grabbing bankruptcy
cases in the late 1980s and early 1990s. One Texas S&AMP;L operator,
for instance, paid $1.17 million cash for a Dallas mansion on the
same day he was indicted for fraud by a federal grand jury. Weeks
later, he filed for bankruptcy, and his home could not be touched
by his creditors.
</P>
<P>
   To counter such abuses, the Senate's bankruptcy reform would set
a national cap of $100,000 for the value of homesteads. A similar
provision in the House bill was removed in a 222-204 vote and
replaced with a rule that prohibits the fraudulent purchase of a
home within one year of filing bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm sees the merit of limiting the value of homesteads _
``when people declare bankruptcy and walk away millionaires,
something needs to be done about it,'' he said _ but he hasn't
decided whether he will support a compromise that his fellow Texas
Republican, Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, plans to introduce.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of the effort to reign in the homestead
provision, other pieces of bankruptcy reform mean big changes for
individual debtors, particularly those whose debts are largely due
to credit-card companies and retailers.
</P>
<P>
   The credit industry has lobbied hard for the legislation, which
would discourage debtors from using Chapter 7 and force more people
into Chapter 13, where at least some debt would be paid down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current bankruptcy system is flawed,'' said William P.
Binzel, vice president of government relations for MasterCard
International. ``It allows debtors to walk away from their debts
even when they have an ability to repay them.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when debts are discharged in bankruptcy, they just don't
go away,'' he said. ``They get passed on to other consumers in the
form of higher prices and interest rates.''
</P>
<P>
   To push more debtors into Chapter 13, the House and Senate
legislation would set a maximum income level for debtors seeking
Chapter 7 relief: no more than national median income, now about
$51,000 for a family of four. Debtors with higher income would be
required to file under Chapter 13.
</P>
<P>
   The punishment for debtors wrongly filing under Chapter 7 would
fall on their lawyers, who would risk losing their fees if their
clients' assets or income disqualified them from Chapter 7 relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real scary for us attorneys who represent people,'' said
James McMillen, a Corpus Christi lawyer who is secretary of the
National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys. ``We're
going to have to send (investigators) to their homes, and we're
still going to miss things that they didn't tell us about.''
</P>
<P>
   The bankruptcy attorneys and consumer advocates are also
disturbed by part of the legislation that would give credit-card
debt a new priority for repayment. Creditors insisted on that
provision, although no more than 1 percent of all credit accounts
end up in bankruptcy, according to lobbyists for both the
credit-card industry and retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it is one percent, what we're seeing increasingly is
double-digit increases in the rate of bankruptcy filings,'' said
MasterCard's Binzel. ``The amount of debts will continue to grow
substantially as well. I have yet to hear a credible argument
promoting a public policy that people should be allowed to walk
away from their debts.''
</P>
<P>
   Westbrook, the bankruptcy-law professor, said Congress and the
credit industry are missing the bigger picture of debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same debates have gone on for the hundred years that we've
had a workable bankruptcy system,'' he said. ``There's always a
sense that, well, somehow these people should pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``A free-market system involves casualties,'' he said. ``We just
have to accept that. That's part of the system.''

<P>
   The punishment for debtors wrongly filing under Chapter 7 would
fall on their lawyers, who would risk losing their fees if their
clients' assets or income disqualified them from Chapter 7 relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real scary for us attorneys who represent people,'' said
James McMillen, a Corpus Christi lawyer who is secretary of the
National Association of Consumer Bankruptcy Attorneys. ``We're
going to have to send (investigators) to their homes, and we're
still going to miss things that they didn't tell us about.''
</P>
<P>
   The bankruptcy attorneys and consumer advocates are also
disturbed by part of the legislation that would give credit-card
debt a new priority for repayment. Creditors insisted on that
provision, although no more than 1 percent of all credit accounts
end up in bankruptcy, according to lobbyists for both the
credit-card industry and retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``While it is one percent, what we're seeing increasingly is
double-digit increases in the rate of bankruptcy filings,'' said
MasterCard's Binzel. ``The amount of debts will continue to grow
substantially as well. I have yet to hear a credible argument
promoting a public policy that people should be allowed to walk
away from their debts.''
</P>
<P>
   Westbrook, the bankruptcy-law professor, said Congress and the
credit industry are missing the bigger picture of debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same debates have gone on for the hundred years that we've
had a workable bankruptcy system,'' he said. ``There's always a
sense that, well, somehow these people should pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``A free-market system involves casualties,'' he said. ``We just
have to accept that. That's part of the system.''

REPORTER'S EFFORTS FREE WOMAN IMPRISONED 25 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JANE GROSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. _ Robert Redford is not clamoring to star in the
movie. Students are not lining up at journalism schools with hopes
of duplicating his reportorial feats. His name will not appear in
history books for toppling an American president.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Gary Craig's accomplishment at The Rochester Democrat and
Chronicle, helping to free a woman wrongly imprisoned for 25 years
for murder, is comparable in its way to the reporting of Woodward
and Bernstein. Like the onetime Washington Post pair, Craig's labor
ended with a dramatic flourish: Betty Tyson's release. But it began
with tedium: months of dogged, thankless work.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tyson was a prostitute and a heroin addict, picked up in a
street sweep after the 1973 murder of an out-of-town businessman in
the red-light district. But Craig, 39, knew little about her
background. The fire that burned in him was not an obsession with
Ms. Tyson's freedom. Rather, he wanted to know if a rogue detective
had run amok, beating confessions out of Ms. Tyson and two teen-age
witnesses who said they saw her with the victim. ``I wasn't writing
about Betty Tyson, the person, or Betty Tyson, the inmate,'' Craig
said. ``I was writing about evidence, about the cops, the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The detective in question, since deceased, had been convicted
for fabricating evidence in a case involving six organized-crime
figures. He was also a defendant in civil suits accusing him of
police abuse. Ms. Tyson and her co-defendant, who is still
imprisoned, said during the trial that their confessions were
coerced. But what of the witnesses? There were rumors here that one
of them, Wayne Wright, confided to family members that he lied on
the stand. With no physical evidence against her, Ms. Tyson was
convicted on the strength of that testimony, and similar assertions
by another teen-ager.
</P>
<P>
   Craig had just completed a project about conditions in state
prisons. At the urging of local advocates for Ms. Tyson, he began
this investigation late in 1996 with a thorough reading of police
files and court transcripts, where he found plenty of red flags.
But the most promising avenue was Wright's rumored recantation.
Craig tracked down Wright's relatives, who confirmed he had told
them he lied. But Wright ignored telephone messages and notes left
at his home.
</P>
<P>
   Undaunted, Craig continued to ``nibble away'' at other aspects
of the case. He researched the history of the detective and found
much to support claims of abusive conduct. He tracked down two
counselors who had been at the jail where Ms. Tyson was held after
her 1973 arrest and said she had bruises on her arms and legs. He
also went to the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility in Westchester
County to talk to Ms. Tyson, the only time they met until her
release.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tyson asked him to take a letter to Wright, begging for the
truth. Only after Craig delivered it did Wright agree to a meeting.
At that lunch, an off-the-record session, Wright said he was trying
to find a way to help her, without jeopardizing himself. From that
day forward, the two men met frequently. Wright had many questions
about the legal implications if he publicly recanted and Craig did
his best to inform him. The reporter also kept Wright abreast of
his other findings, thus reassuring him that the article he had in
mind would be a comprehensive revisiting of the case.
</P>
<P>
   By now, it was the summer of 1997. One day, Craig would tell his
editors, ``I'm close.'' The next day, he would have to beg for more
time. But Craig was confident. ``I felt comfortable waiting for him
to feel comfortable,'' Craig said of Wright. ``And all the waiting
gave us time to build a case on all the other fronts.''
</P>
<P>
   In November, Wright agreed to tell Craig, on the record, that he
had lied on the stand. But he had one lingering reservation. Ms.
Tyson had no lawyer. What good would his recantation do if there
was nobody to file a motion on her behalf? Craig found a local
lawyer to take her case and Wright produced a 15-page affidavit.
</P>
<P>
   Craig's article spanned two full pages of the paper and included
Wright's affidavit, the new evidence from the jail counselors and a
profile of the deceased detective who is believed to have beaten
both the suspects and the witnesses into making false statements.
It took months for Ms. Tyson's new lawyer, Jon Getz, to file a
motion for dismissal, but it was in the hands of the judge in
February of this year.
</P>
<P>
   In anticipation of the discovery process, the Monroe County
district attorney began digging through old files. Among them was a
single sheet of paper that in the end persuaded the judge to
reverse the conviction: a police report, never introduced into
evidence, in which the other witness, Jon Jackson, said he had not
seen the suspect and the victim together.
</P>
<P>
   That report alone, Judge John Connell ruled in May, could have
produced a different verdict. The case could be tried again,
Connell said, but the district attorney decided not to because of
Ms. Tyson's long incarceration and the death of key witnesses. On
May 27, 25 years to the day from her arrest, Betty Tyson was free.
</P>
<P>
   Craig was invited to celebrate with the Tyson family that night.
But in the weeks since, he has spent considerably more time with
Wright, whom he had come to know well during their long
negotiations. And he is back at work in the trenches of Rochester's
courts and police stations, examining several other cases handled,
or mishandled, by the same detective, William Mahoney. ``This has
solidified in my mind the sort of work we should be doing,'' Craig
said. ``But I worry we're doing less of it than we used to.''

EDITORS REFLECT ON FABRICATIONS BY GLOBE COLUMNIST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Ill., Calif., N.Y.)  (mk) 
 By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   News that The Boston Globe had asked last week for the
resignation of Patricia Smith, a metropolitan region columnist,
because of fabrications in her work, prompted self-examination at
other newspapers around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes us rethink for sure,'' said George Langford, the
public editor at The Chicago Tribune, who acts as the newspaper's
ombudsman. ``It certainly sharpens your antennae. I suppose that's
about the only good thing I can see coming out of it, because it
certainly is very damaging to all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   While fact-checking departments have long been a tradition at
some magazines, daily newspapers have largely relied on their
reporters when it comes to accuracy. Because of the pressures of
daily deadlines and the volume of copy coursing through a newsroom
in any given night, newspapers say they have no choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned that these organizations inevitably depend on
trust,'' said Robert Kaiser, managing editor of The Washington
Post, alluding to the case of Janet Cooke, a reporter who admitted
to creating a composite of an inner-city youth for an article that
won the Pulitzer Prize. ``If there is a system that can guarantee
things of this kind can't happen, I haven't heard of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have such a system, and I guess I think that the
Patricia Smith episode may be evidence of why there's no point in
it really,'' Kaiser continued _ ``why it can't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Joseph Lelyveld, the executive editor of The New York
Times, said, ``We operate from a position of trust in our
reporters.''
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that newspapers have safeguards, editors say,
these are their many levels of editing. Langford said the Chicago
Tribune's first line of defense was its ``source'' editors, editors
who deal with content. After that, Langford said, articles go
through the copy desk.
</P>
<P>
   At The Wall Street Journal, the managing editor, Paul Steiger,
said an article could go through a varying number of editors,
depending on its importance and where it will run in the paper. ``A
page one story can have five, sometimes six, levels of editors,''
he said. ``Small, inside news stories will have two.''
</P>
<P>
   While columnists have more room to offer their opinions or
analysis, Steiger said, ``The checking process is the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Loeb, editor of The Columbia Journalism Review,
suggested that newspapers consider instituting fact-checking
procedures for particular kinds of articles. ``A newspaper would be
well served if it had available some fact checkers to examine and
raise questions about certain complicated and controversial stories
or series of stories,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure that Ms. Smith had concocted people and quotes in
at least four columns earlier this year was particularly dramatic,
given that it became public just a week after The New Republic
concluded that Stephen Glass, a staff writer, fabricated all or
part of 27 of the 41 articles he wrote for the magazine in two and
a half years.
</P>
<P>
   But editors say incidents of fakery remain few. Leo Wolinsky,
managing editor for news at The Los Angeles Times, said about 10
years ago a reporter was dismissed after making up quotations that
he contended came from a news-agency dispatch. (It turned out that
the reporter had altered the wire story to include the fabricated
quotes.) Wolinsky said another reporter was dismissed for
plagiarizing from a script for public television.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In response to the Globe incident, Wolinsky said Michael Parks,
the editor of The Los Angeles Times, had asked his staff to reflect
on the situation at their early-morning meeting. ``He asked us to
think about what we're doing and whether we're on the right path,''
Wolinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Wolinsky, as well as several other editors interviewed, said
they were surprised to learn that Matthew Storin, editor of The
Globe, a New York Times Co. newspaper, had established a
spot-checking system of columnists a couple of years ago. ``That's
something I didn't know took place anywhere,'' Wolinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Seaton, president of the American Society of Newspaper
Editors, said his organization was about to come out with a study
that examined the extent to which newspaper credibility had
declined. ``Newspapers have declined more than other media,''
Seaton said. ``We're concerned about that.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent informal study on corrections, the society found
that 21 newspapers had formal procedures for finding out how an
error occurred and 35 had informal procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Seaton also said that the society was reviewing its decision to
give a distinguished-writing award to Ms. Smith earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Smith case, coupled with the Glass incident, has prompted
publications to speculate about what would drive a reporter to
cross the bright line from fact into fiction. Was it the pressure
to produce, to stand out, to sustain a heady level of success?
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly is more pressure these days to make newspapers
more compelling to readers,'' Wolinsky said. ``Everybody wants to
be special and everybody wants their stories to be talked about and
read, and the truth about it is most people don't have such
scintillating quotes. And if they could make it up themselves, it
would read a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Although editors generally said the Smith and Glass cases had
not prompted them to change their policies, several said these,
along with the frenzied Monica Lewinsky coverage, had made them
more cautious. ``We're more circumspect today,'' Langford of The
Chicago Tribune said. ``The downside is just too great.''
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how careful, editors insisted, a newspaper cannot
completely prevent such violations. ``Absent some kind of Draconian
_ `give me a photograph and the driver's license of everyone you've
quoted,''' Kaiser of The Washington Post said, ``someone who had
the inclination to do this sort of thing could probably get away
with it.''

HAWKING VIDEOCASSETTES  
 PUBLISHER BACK IN THE CLUB  
 BUZZ OVER BELL BOOK  
 NEW LOOK FOR CJR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Will Barry Diller start making infomercials for NBC? Now that
NBC has begun _or at least tiptoed _ into the business of selling
videocassettes directly to consumers, it might want an outside
company to produce them.
</P>
<P>
   And with Diller at the helm of USA Networks, the parent of the
Home Shopping Network, USA would be a logical choice.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies have had some ``very preliminary''
discussions, as one person close to the talks put it. And though
Diller has declined to comment, he has made no secret of his desire
to use his shopping network's direct-response capabilities for
outside clients.
</P>
<P>
   He is already mapping his plans for USA. The company owns a
Miami television station and plans to experiment with selling
sports clothing in connection with broadcasts of Miami Heat
basketball games.
</P>
<P>
   Then why not produce commercials for NBC if it wants to sell
more home videos? NBC took its first steps in direct marketing on
the network in April when it sold videocassettes of its miniseries
``Merlin'' directly to audiences, using two 30-second spots. In
just one minute it sold 100,000 videocassettes for $29.95 each.
</P>
<P>
   Hawking cassettes may not be as classy as having Nike promote
sneakers. But it is lucrative, and at a time when the networks are
scrambling for more revenue, selling merchandise can be appealing.
</P>
<P>
   With NBC being owned by General Electric, maybe some day the
network could even start selling light bulbs and dishwashers.
</P>
<P>
   Renegade Rejoins Establishment
</P>
<P>
   So the wild cowboy has finally joined the club. After five years
of spurning the Magazine Publishers of America, David Pecker, the
president and chief executive of Hachette Filipacchi Magazines _
which publishes Elle, George and Mirabella _ has rejoined the
industry association.
</P>
<P>
   When Pecker was first starting out in 1990, he was viewed as
something of an outsider because he did things differently _
acquiring magazines like crazy, taking out a full-page ad in large
newspapers to criticize a competitor's ad strategy, unabashedly
going after big advertising contracts and turning his back on the
association in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   But as Pecker has built Hachette, a unit of Lagardere Groupe,
into a successful company over the last eight years and as the
industry has increasingly moved toward Pecker's way of doing
business, Hachette has gradually won its way back into the good
graces of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The move represents a triumph for the association, which has
been courting Pecker ever since he pulled out. The trade group will
get the benefit of Hachette's annual dues _ magazine companies pay
according to their gross revenues _ as well as the influence of a
company like Hachette, which has gone from 14 titles to 30 and
become the No. 3 magazine company in ad pages, behind Time Inc. and
Conde Nast and ahead of Hearst Magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Pecker said he initially resigned because he did not like the
direction the association was going and thought the dues were not
worth the money. Under Hachette's new arrangement with the
association, the magazine company will pay a total of $400,000 in
dues over the first four years and $400,000 a year after that,
according to a Hachette executive who insisted on anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Among the few publishing companies that remain outside the
association are Forbes magazine and Wenner Media, which publishes
Rolling Stone.
</P>
<P>
   Pulitzer-Winning Writer Cries Foul
</P>
<P>
   If the Scottish writer James Mackay had been content to publish
his new biography of Alexander Graham Bell in Britain, perhaps
Robert Bruce, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian, would not have
stirred.
</P>
<P>
   But, as the 74-year-old Bruce put it, Mackay strayed too far
into his ``historical precinct,'' igniting a dispute about
plagiarism that probably will result in the shredding of several
thousand copies of ``Alexander Graham Bell: A Life,'' which was
published this spring by John Wiley &AMP; Sons in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been studying and writing history for 50 years, and I've
never heard of anything like this before,'' said Bruce, the author
of a 1973 biography of Alexander Graham Bell. ``He seems to have
written with a typewriter and a thesaurus.''
</P>
<P>
   Lingua Franca, the academic magazine, and Slate, the online
magazine, have detailed the dispute, which centers on Bruce's
contention that Mackay borrowed his research, structure and
concepts.
</P>
<P>
   The biography was first published in Britain by Mainstream
Publishing, and Wiley bought the rights to publish it in the United
States. Several people close to the situation said an agreement was
circulating among the writers and publishers that would stave off a
lawsuit in exchange for Wiley's agreement to declare the book out
of print and to shred the remaining copies.
</P>
<P>
   Reached in his native Scotland, Mackay said he was
``flabbergasted'' by the contretemps with Bruce, whom he
acknowledges on page 12 of his book. He said he had tried to write
a more general biography of Bell, which was aimed at a much less
academic readership. Mackay sent Bruce a note of apology,
explaining, ``I had absolutely no idea that anything I had done
could be construed as plagiarism.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite their obvious dedication to Alexander Graham Bell's
legacy, neither author has resorted to what seems like an obvious
step to resolve the dispute _ share a phone conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Journalism Review Polishes Its Look
</P>
<P>
   Call it coincidence. On second thought, don't even bother. Even
its editor says The Columbia Journalism Review's decision to jazz
up its look with the July/August issue has something to do with the
fact that Brill's Content came out earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Brill's Content is the first magazine to give The
Columbia Journalism Review _ otherwise known as CJR _ some real
competition. But Marshall Loeb, the Review's editor, said he
welcomed the challenge. ``I think there is enough going on in the
world of media and journalism that there is room for a number of
us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The changes at the Review are subtle, however. Loeb said the
magazine had been gradually phasing them in for some time. Perhaps
the most drastic shift is the cover design; the magazine will use
the full name Columbia Journalism Review instead of CJR. Loeb said
this was to emphasize that the magazine was about journalism.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Loeb said he had been trying to make the magazine
more reader friendly, with more pictures and graphics, subheads and
entry points and a slightly decreased type size to allow for more
articles.
</P>
<P>
   The Review, which was founded in 1961 and has a circulation of
about 30,000, covers the same terrain as Brill's Content, which is
aiming for a circulation of 500,000. For example, Loeb said the
Review featured a similar article _ albeit, minus a few revelations
_ four months ago about how the press handled coverage of Monica
Lewinsky. What the Review doesn't have is the same sort of buzz.

DIGITAL COMMERCE: LEGISLATION GATHERS FORCE
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a climate where any regulation of the Internet in its
commercial infancy is considered high treason, many law experts are
dismayed at the tidal wave of restrictive legislation _ governing
everything from software filters to digital copyrights and public
domain information _ being drafted and enacted by states and the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Currently these experts find themselves battling yet another
``solution in search of a problem'' in the form of a far-reaching
revision to the Uniform Commercial Code _ the body of law, mostly
common to all 50 states, that governs a broad range of commercial
transactions, including the sale of goods.
</P>
<P>
   The revision, a 200-page epic called Article 2B, would legislate
on the sale of virtually all kinds of digital information,
including data, text, images, sounds, computer programs, software
and data bases.
</P>
<P>
   When work on 2B began in the early 1990s, ``our primary concern
was software,'' said Gene Lebrun, the president of the National
Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (www.nccusl.org).
The conference is a volunteer group responsible for revising and
updating the code in conjunction with, and monitored by, the
American Law Institute (www.ali.org).
</P>
<P>
   ``But as technology changed,'' Lebrun said, ``we figured that
eventually software would go the way of the 78-rpm record, and the
law would probably be outdated.'' So instead, he said, ``we started
working on contracts governing all copyrighted information.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, many critics say, was the first step down the wrong
path. Article 2B is so overbroad and complex, the critics say, that
it threatens to bury in legalese the very electronic commerce
industry that it was created to encourage.
</P>
<P>
   As its foundation, the Article supports the controversial
``shrink wrap'' license, used for years by software companies,
which asserts that consumers do not ``buy'' a software product, but
merely buy a license to use the software in limited ways.
</P>
<P>
   Most courts have refused to uphold these licenses for many
reasons _ not the least of which, they say, is that buyers cannot
be held to a contract that they only see after they have already
paid for the product.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the enormously complex Article 2B was built around the
shrink-wrap premise.
</P>
<P>
   It renames this shrink-wrap license a ``mass-market contract'' _
a term that many lawyers consider an oxymoron, since one party to
the contract, the buyer, is not free to negotiate its terms in
advance. What is more, it details a complex legal and technical
infrastructure for governing and enforcing these contracts for all
digital information sold.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, some legal scholars assert there can be little
argument that Article 2B is bound to run into trouble as the
commercial Internet continues its chaotic development.
</P>
<P>
   For example, jurisdictional problems abound. The Uniform
Commercial Code's provisions become law in any given state only
after they are adopted by that state's legislature. So what happens
when an information product _ software, music, whatever _ is
purchased in a state that has not signed on to Article 2B but was
sold in a state that does?
</P>
<P>
   And how does one apply the rules when a single purchase buys
both information and more traditional goods _ say, for example, a
WebTV system? What parts of the law apply to which parts of the
same transaction?
</P>
<P>
   As it is written today, Article 2B is so convoluted that even
those who are intimately involved have difficulty answering such
questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does the text say? It is difficult to follow in many
respects,'' said Geoffrey Hazard, the director of the American Law
Institute and a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania.
``When I'm talking to you on the telephone, for example, we're
exchanging information _ we're even doing it electronically. Is
that governed by this law? They say no, but I say why not? It's not
clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Article 2B even tries to legislate in territory that does not
yet exist. For example, it would make legally binding any
transaction made by an ``electronic agent'' that acts on behalf of
a buyer. Such a law seems more than premature when this kind of
``agent technology,'' although anticipated, has not yet made a
successful foray out of the laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Yet those who support Article 2B are convinced that new laws are
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Understanding and resolving some of these issues is essential
to making the Internet work,'' said Holly Towle, a partner with
Preston Gates &AMP; Ellis LLP, who was hired to represent the Business
Software Association on the Article 2B committee. (The
association's guide to 2B is at
www.softwareindustry.org/issues/guide/index.html.) ``You have to
solve some of these things or companies will be reluctant to put
their information onto the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   But her point of view has some powerful opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Contract law that's stated in terms of regulating information
is just infeasible and therefore undesirable,'' Hazard said. ``I do
think changes could be helpful in defining electronic contracting.
I think there's potential in governing software to some extent.
Beyond that, I'd like to feel that I understand the text of the
Article. And we're still engaged in that process.''
</P>
<P>
   Such strong sentiments seem to be having an effect. The final
draft of Article 2B was scheduled for consideration by state law
commissioners at their annual meeting in July; instead, the group
will keep hearing opposing arguments and working with Professor
Hazard to modify Article 2B.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say to us, `Don't you know how important this is?' We
say, `You bet we do, and that's why we won't support a statute that
will create a lot of problems,''' Hazard said. ``This legislation
would govern an enormous amount of commerce, and a set of
difficult-to-understand rules of uncertain scope wouldn't be
helpful. We'd be back to square one.''

PAIN MEDICATION THAT CAN BE INHALED  
 DRUG TESTING BY A MACHINE  
 GETTING A GRIP ON POPCORN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Md., Mo.)   (bl)  
 By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   A study published last week in The Journal of the American
Medical Association found that many elderly people who are in pain
do not receive adequate medication to ease their discomfort. But
this problem is not limited to the elderly. Other reports in recent
years have drawn attention to the fact that many cancer patients,
as well as people recovering from surgery, do not get enough pain
relief either.
</P>
<P>
   Aradigm Corp. has patented a technology that it says will make
pain medication much easier to administer.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which is based in Hayward, Calif., specializes in
making inhalable forms of drugs that previously have had to be
injected _ insulin, for example. It is also developing an inhalable
form of morphine, which is often the drug of choice for those in
severe pain but which must be administered intravenously.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Reid Rubsamen, vice president of medical affairs for
Aradigm, first started thinking about low technology ways to
improve the lives of patients while he was pursuing a doctorate at
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He is the inventor or
co-inventor of 33 patents held by Aradigm, including the
pain-relief technology, which is in clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Currently, IV pumps are underutilized in the home,'' said
Rubsamen, an anesthesiologist. ``You have to pay for a nurse to
administer the pump and it gets very expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``The whole idea is to liberate patients from IV pumps
and to give them good access to effective pain relief.''
</P>
<P>
   Aradigm is developing a hand-held electronic inhaler that holds
30 doses of morphine sulfate. The inhaler is programmed so that a
patient can receive a new dose only at prescribed intervals.
</P>
<P>
   This easy access to morphine, however, presents a new problem:
How to keep the drug out of the hands of people who should not have
it.
</P>
<P>
   Rubsamen has also patented a system similar to that found in
so-called smart guns. The inhaler will work only once it has read a
digital code on a bracelet worn by the patient.
</P>
<P>
   This precaution will keep the inhaler out of the hands of
children, but it is unlikely to thwart an adult in the household
who wanted to procure the morphine for recreational reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a felon, you can defeat the system by stealing the
bracelet,'' Rubsamen acknowledged. ``But in real life, the main
safety issue is someone picking it up accidentally.`
</P>
<P>
   Aradigm is developing the pain- management system in partnership
with SmithKline Beecham. The patent, number 5,694,919, is the most
recent to be assigned to Aradigm for the safety technology.
</P>
<P>
   Drug Testing By a Machine
</P>
<P>
   Although drug testing is becoming increasingly prevalent in the
workplace, blood and urine tests can detect only a handful of the
many mind-altering substances available either legally or
illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Thus a process called drug recognition _ first developed by the
Los Angeles Police Department in 1979 _ is becoming more widely
used. Officers trained in drug recognition look for behavioral and
physical signs that are characteristic of drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Alpert, a drug test administrator at the University of
Maryland at College Park, has patented a software system that he
says enables a machine to do what these trained officers do.
</P>
<P>
   Alpert contends that his system can detect drug use _ and
identify which class or classes of drugs a person has been using _
simply by empirically evaluating that person's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   His device measures pupil size, tracks eye movement and gauges
the eyes' reaction to light. Someone who has ingested hallucinogens
like LSD or certain mushrooms will have hugely dilated pupils, for
example. ``Whereas for opiates a big sign is that pupils will be
constricted and won't react to light,'' Alpert said.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, it takes Alpert's invention about six minutes to
evaluate someone. ``But I'm hoping to get that down to 30
seconds,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alpert, who said his system was being tested by several police
departments, has started Drugensic, a company based in Ellicott
City, Md., to develop the product.
</P>
<P>
   Getting a Grip On Popcorn
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Young of Cy Young Industries in Kansas City, Mo., has
received a patent for a popcorn holder that attaches to stadium or
theater seats.
</P>
<P>
   The U-shaped bracket cantilevers off the arm of a seat and is
designed to be installed permanently.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Young said her company was named after her grandfather, Cy
Young. So did the world-class pitcher ever patent any inventions of
his own?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I'm no relation to the ballplayer,'' Ms. Young explained.
``My grandfather just happened to have the same name.''
</P>
<P>
   She received patent 5,720,516.
</P>
<P>
   Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and
Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231. &QL;

GRAHAM DANCE COMPANY TO SELL HEADQUARTERS BUILDING
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The board of the Martha Graham Dance Company voted
last week to sell the financially hard-pressed company's
headquarters and school on East 63rd Street in Manhattan. The vote,
on June 16, was unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will move on to smaller quarters and regroup in a new home,
I know,'' the artistic director of the Graham company, Ron Protas,
said on Friday. ``But to lose this historic building is a
tragedy.'' Graham created dances like ``Acts of Light,'' ``The Rite
of Spring'' and ``Temptations of the Moon'' in the three decades
she worked in the back studio of the odd-shaped little brick
building, which may be demolished. Many of today's dancers and
choreographers, in the United States and abroad, trained at the
school.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who studied and rehearsed in the studios were Rudolf
Nureyev, Mikhail Barsyhnikov, Natalia Makarova, Twyla Tharp, Robert
Wilson, Madonna, and Woody Allen. The studio in which Graham worked
opened out to a small garden next to the building; it provided a
quiet spot for meditation and a place for parties attended by
artists, musicians, film and theater performers and fashion
designers of the day. For many years, a tree grew through the wire
fence around the garden, symbolic, Graham often said, of the
persistence of art.
</P>
<P>
   Proceeds from the sale will be used in part, over a 12-month
period, to resolve outstanding debt and help the company work
toward a negotiated settlement of the building's mortgage. Todd
Dellinger, managing director of the troupe, said that those would
be the first steps in a three-to-four-year plan for the
stabilization and revitalization of the company, which would invest
proceeds from the sale in an endowment and begin a capital campaign
to raise money for a new permanent home.
</P>
<P>
   Dellinger said that the Graham troupe would have to operate for
two years out of minimal rented office and studio space, with a
reduced school enrollment though a full complement of technique
courses. With the company on layoff during this time, emphasis
would also be placed on training future Graham dancers who perform
in the junior company, the Martha Graham Dance Ensemble. The
ensemble will perform June 24-27 at the Marymount Manhattan Theater
in a program that includes several rarely seen dances by Graham.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have worked here to maintain one of the true American art
forms of the 20th century, created by the person Time magazine
deemed `Dancer of the Century' just a few weeks back,'' Dellinger
said. ``This is the home of such a glorious artistic tradition for
this country. You'd think that someone would have wanted to make
sure it stayed that way.''

FOR THE FUTURE OF TAX COLLECTION, LOOK TO KANSAS

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOPEKA, Kan. _ The new way that taxes are collected in this
Midwest state capital may offer taxpayers everywhere a glimpse of
what the future may be like in dealing with the IRS.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the taxpayer from Great Bend who recently called the
Kansas Department of Revenue to inquire about his state income tax
refund, which was weeks overdue. John Waldo, whose title is
customer representative, asked for the caller's Social Security
number and typed it into his computer. Instantly his screen filled
with both an image of the caller's tax return and a summary report
showing that the Post Office had returned the refund check because
the taxpayer had moved.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's your new address?'' asked Waldo, who then typed it in
and promised the caller that his check would go out the next
morning. Solving the taxpayer's problem took less than a minute
because Kansas has applied modern information technology and a
customer-service attitude to the time-dishonored task of processing
income tax returns, creating an operation that resembles the
billing system of a credit card company.
</P>
<P>
   Paper tax returns are now fed into Kodak scanners that create an
image from which custom character-recognition software extracts
information identifying the taxpayer and the numbers on the return
and feeds it into a central database. The system allows quick
access to each taxpayer's records. It also creates a storehouse of
data on all taxpayers that will help flag returns for possible
audit and uncover patterns, especially in sales tax remittances,
that suggest cheating.
</P>
<P>
   So remarkable is the Kansas system _ even to other tax
collectors _ that in New Orleans on June 16 the Federation of Tax
Administrators, the organization for state tax agencies, will give
Kansas two awards at its annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   And the changes adopted by Kansas may become relevant for all
the nation's taxpayers _ oops, customers _ because the techniques
are strikingly similar to ones outlined by Charles Rossotti, the
businessman whom President Clinton made IRS commissioner last year
with orders to modernize the service.
</P>
<P>
   The similarities are no coincidence: The prime contractor
building the Kansas tax system is American Management Systems of
Fairfax, Va., where Rossotti was chief executive until last fall.
(As the largest individual shareholder in American Management
Systems, Rossotti will be required by federal ethics rules to hand
over all decision-making authority on the contracts if the company
ends up bidding to build a new computer operation for the IRS).
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Kansas' new integrated system, which started to
be phased in last year and will be completely operational by the
fall of 1999, the current federal IRS operation is scattered across
some 50 disparate computer systems _ most of which cannot
communicate with one another and some of which date to the era when
Elvis Presley was not only alive but thin. No wonder that a federal
taxpayer with even a minor problem with the IRS can get lost in the
cybervoid among these computer systems, one of which may be
acknowledging receipt of taxes at the same time another is issuing
demands for payment.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas, like most states, used to operate pretty much a
miniature version of the federal tax collection system. Like the
IRS, its tax agency was ruled by policies conceived in what some
critics say was an official attitude that all taxpayers are out to
cheat the government and must never be trusted.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not the policy in Kansas anymore _ especially not
since John LaFaver, who had been tax commissioner in Maine and
Montana, became the Kansas tax commissioner three years ago.
LaFaver set to work shifting the tax department's culture from one
that hunted for every last dime of revenue, especially from
corporations, to a culture built around service and making
compliance with the tax laws easier. (As part of the new service
philosophy, every law, regulation and policy that the Kansas
Department of Revenue uses _ some 7,400 documents _ is posted at
www.ink.org/public/kdor on the World Wide Web.)
</P>
<P>
   LaFaver said the new policy was based on ``an assumption that
most people are honest and trying to pay their taxes and our job is
to help them.'' And there is pragmatism behind the politesse. ``If
we succeed, we will bring in more revenue,'' LaFaver said,
``because compliance will improve.''
</P>
<P>
   To distinguish between taxpayers who comply and those who need
to be closely watched, the system employs an extensive database. If
a business is due to remit its quarterly taxes on a Monday, for
example, but does not meet the deadline, the new system
automatically interrogates the database.
</P>
<P>
   If the business has a history of paying on time, the computer
sends the taxpayer a notice and then schedules itself for an
automatic review, assigning taxpayers with good payment histories
to an escalating schedule of notices, telephone calls and
ultimately collection efforts that span eight months, if required.
For the most chronically delinquent taxpayers, that schedule is
accelerated to four months.
</P>
<P>
   To a large degree, the changes in Kansas involve a shift in risk
from the taxpayer to the government. Consider the hypothetical case
of a taxpayer who earned $14,000 last year and properly reported it
on his tax return, but then received an audit notice that a hefty
sum in taxes, penalties and interest was due on income of $114,000.
That kind of mistake can easily occur at the IRS, where thousands
of clerks manually punch into computers the numbers listed on tax
returns.
</P>
<P>
   And it used to occur in Kansas. Nadine Cloud, a customer
representative, said that under the old system a taxpayer who
called with such a problem faced long delays _ while demands for
payment continued to go out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now you get the taxpayer's Social Security number and, boom,
you get the image of their return and see the mistake,'' she said.
``You can fix it immediately.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The new system has not always worked so smoothly. Last year,
when it was new, the scanners misread so many names and numbers
that tax returns were delayed up to three weeks. But the problem
was solved, and this year's refunds were issued faster than in
1996, the last year under the manual system. Refunds now go into
the mail seven to 10 days after returns are received, said Karla
Pierce, the official supervising the transition to the new system.
</P>
<P>
   To the state, the greatest benefit is the ability to perform
intense statistical analysis of income and sales tax returns to
hunt for those who chisel and cheat, and to reduce the number of
audits of people who do not (and whose audits produce little or no
additional revenue).
</P>
<P>
   The state is also pushing to get more people to file
electronically. One in five did so last year, and LaFaver expects
two-thirds to do so three years from now.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas lawmakers approved the makeover plan after being
convinced that the costs _ a modest $75 million or so _ could be
paid for from new revenues generated as a more efficient
tax-processing system inexpensively identified people and companies
who were not paying, or not fully paying, their taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Fixing the IRS, of course, will be a much more daunting task
than the five-year project here. Kansas collects $4.6 billion in
taxes annually, or roughly what the IRS takes in as a daily
average.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS will also have to deal with a variety of taxpaying
cultures compared with Kansas, where taxpayers are generally so
compliant that even their federal returns are audited by the IRS at
only about two-thirds the average rate for the nation as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   But while the IRS has policy walls intended to make sure no one
gets a dollar back that is not deserved, Kansas officials have
decided that it is smarter to assume that most people are honest.
</P>
<P>
   So what happens if, say, the caller from Great Bend was a crook
who gave a phony address to intercept someone else's refund check?
</P>
<P>
   ``That will happen,'' conceded Waldo, the customer
representative. And when it is discovered, he said, the state will
promptly send the real taxpayer the refund and then try to recover
the money sent to the crook.

SLAYER CONCERT IS LIKE WATCHING A FURNACE ROAR
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS.: the phrase ``oh yea'' is cq.) 
(ja) 
 By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's hard not to resort to metaphor in describing a
Slayer concert, because what you're confronted with is both
kinetically massive and uniform, blank, detailless.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986 the band recorded ``Reign in Blood,'' an album that's
still the primary sacrament of death-metal; the short, powerful
record mixed the rhythms of hardcore punk with a single-minded
focus on ritual violence. As a lot of defunct death-metal bands
have since found out, carnage and devilry are a tricky songwriting
trope: unless you make a living as a torturer, you can only imagine
it in so many ways before you get tangled up in cliches and the
clunky Victorianisms that go so well with decadent themes.
</P>
<P>
   But metal, for some reason, continues to need words, and where
they were prolific in the '80s, now the band's songwriters squeeze
out a batch of malevolent scenarios every three years or so.
``Imagine humanity's decline,'' sings Tom Araya in one of the
band's songs on its new album, ``Diabolus in Musica'' (Columbia).
``Step inside my stain of mind/infesting superiority/infectious
immorality, oh yea.''
</P>
<P>
   Let the metaphors begin, oh yea: Watching Slayer's show at
Irving Plaza on Wednesday night was no more or less interesting
than watching an enormous furnace for 90 minutes. It was also like
being crushed by an archetype. The members of Slayer constructed
the language of death-metal, and in concert they set about
deploying it purely, with as little variation as possible. This
enforces the in-crowd aspect of the music. If you have to ask at
this point, you'll never know.
</P>
<P>
   The drummer Paul Bostaph began the show with a few triplet
rhythms that gave way to single slablike beats, spaced apart; it
was a teasing ritual. Then the speed-metal of ``Hell Awaits''
began. Typically, the songs flickered between thrashing two-beat
rhythms and a starchily funky four, with a flowing, histrionic
high-note guitar solo nailed somewhere in the middle. Slayer's
pleasures are purely physical; some of the show's best moments were
the pockets of winded silence after the band had ended a 400
beats-per-minute song and before the fans could physically raise a
cheer.
</P>
<P>
   Eight of the 11 songs on ``Diabolus in Musica,'' a few of which
were played at the show, are in the same gray key, and the band's
rhythmic ideas have a wearying sameness too. Other major metal
bands _ Pantera, Metallica, Megadeth _ at this point, more than a
decade into their careers, are diverse by comparison. In a
career-retrospective show like the one at Irving Plaza, you can
feel it's all one barreling song.
</P>
<P>
   Slayer's impact is bigger than even a large club like Irving
Plaza ought to withstand; the band's massive sound board, to the
rear of the room, displaced about 100 people. But previous shows at
larger halls have proven that Slayer fans and furniture of any kind
_ even chairs bolted to the floor _ do not mix. At Irving Plaza, a
whole new crop of young fans filled the floor, becoming an eruption
of arms, legs and hair. They knew the coordinates, yelling every
refrain; for ``Angel of Death,'' the final song, the air in front
of the stage rained with stage divers.

unruly Wall Street professionals who, as part of the deal, will
become holders of 15 percent of the shares of Berkshire Hathaway,
Buffett's far-flung corporate empire. By Edward Wyatt.

 &HT;    Florida wildfires burn as dry weather continues
 &HT;    By Scott McCabe and Scott Cech
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Wildfires burned in more than half of
Florida's rain-starved counties Saturday, as weary fire fighters
from North Florida to Palm Beach County battled scattered hot spots
in 90 degree-plus heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would take a tropical system to dump a lot of water on the
state to make a difference,'' said Barbara Doran of the Florida
Emergency Operations Center in Tallahassee, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   In all, she said, fires burned in 38 of Florida's 67 counties,
though fire threats to Jacksonville and the Alachua County town of
Waldo _ the only populous areas affected _ diminished.
</P>
<P>
   Palm Beach County firefighters battled 14 brush fires Saturday.
None threatened homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The dry conditions of course make it easier for brush fires to
start,'' said Nigel Baker, spokesman for county Fire Rescue.
</P>
<P>
   On the Treasure Coast, a wave of afternoon lighting flashes
ignited at least half a dozen fires in the deccicated brush.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Lucie County, strong winds downed tree limbs and tore
power lines loose and pea-sized hail pounded Fort Pierce.
</P>
<P>
   A fire that started about 2 p.m. in St. Lucie County threatened
local businesses, so sheriff's deputies briefly closed down a
section of U.S. 1 as a precaution. The fire came within 100 yards
of the highway at one point, fire officials said, but Forest
Service firefighting equipment was in such high demand throughout
the area that no bulldozers were available to dig fire trenches.
</P>
<P>
   And instead of the rain that might have dampened the blazes,
some areas of the Treasure Coast got high winds that fed the fires.
Other significant brush fires were started in Fort Pierce and
western St. Lucie County.
</P>
<P>
   Blazes have ravaged drought-striken Florida since Memorial Day,
singeing more than 67,000 acres and damaging 114 homes and
businesses. One person died in Seminole County.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, President Clinton declared all of Florida a fire
disaster area, giving emergency relief to exhausted fire fighters.
</P>
<P>
   That federal emergency declaration expanded a previous one from
seven counties to every one of Florida's 67 counties. The latest
move would bring in federal forestry workers and equipment to help
fight the Florida blazes.
</P>
<P>
   A swamp fire at San Pardo Bay enveloped the region in choking
smoke.
</P>
<P>
   Since Thursday, fire has burned more than 7,500 acres of private
forest at the northeast corner of Taylor County. And although it's
blown dense, smog-like smoke 100 miles east to Jacksonvillle, it's
hard to see. But it's out there, crackling just beyond the green
thicket of pond cypress, slash pine, swampcyrilla, and razor-sharp
greenbriar vines.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a tremendously big fire, I'm afraid,''
said Bill Crane, a member of the North Carolina forest firefighting
team that has sparred with the wildfire since it began.
</P>
<P>
   More than 25 forest-fire fighters, including South Carolina
crews, are expected to join the army of 97 people already on hand.
</P>
<P>
   Crews remained on the defensive Saturday. Bulldozers ploughed
the dense brush along existing dirt roads, carving out a 25-mile
perimeter in which to keep the fire contained.
</P>
<P>
   Tractor crews bunkered down along a 50-yard-wide strip where an
underground gas line had been built. The pipe was too far below the
earth to be a danger, but Incident Commander John Pearson worried
heavy smoke might ground out nearby power lines.
</P>
<P>
   As smoke thickened several hundred yards off, crews remained
skittish.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been kind of waiting, creeping around, burning real
slow,'' said Travis McCoy, a crew member of Foley Timber and Land
Co. ``That's good for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley and Gilman Paper Co. own most of this timber land that
stretches on for more than 100,000 acres, Pearson said.
</P>
<P>
   Staff writers Jennifer Peltz, Monika Gonzalez and William
Cooper, Jr. and the Associated Press contributed to this story.

LILITH FAIR REVIEW: EXTOLLING FEMININITY, GENTLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANN POWERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ Sarah McLachlan does not want the Lilith Fair,
the summerlong ``celebration of women in music'' that began its
second year Friday at the Civic Auditorium here, to be judged as a
political intervention.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McLachlan, the Canadian singer-songwriter and Lilith
founder, has said she wanted concertgoers to appreciate the
artistry of this touring bill of female artists, and to leave
questions of its social impact for the history books.
</P>
<P>
   Judging Lilith Fair on esthetic terms, however, demands
exploring what unites its participants beyond gender. Such
collective interests turn the best summer festivals into events
rather than just painfully long concerts. Consider Lilith as if it
were a bluegrass fest, then, or a day of Dixieland jazz: a
gathering devoted to an esoteric musical style. At Lilith, feminine
folk-pop is the chosen arcana.
</P>
<P>
   Viewing Lilith this way derails the questions that critics have
raised about its lack of diversity. (The tour goes out on its
farthest limb later in its schedule, when hip-hop stylist Missy
Elliott joins in for some dates.) It finds strengths in the
resemblances among the five acts that shared the concert's main
stage on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   These artists _ Ms. McLachlan, Natalie Merchant, the Indigo
Girls, Erykah Badu and Sinead O'Connor _ are masters of the brand
of tuneful, literary pop that explores woman-centered myths and
realities. Appearing with their own bands here, each claimed a
stake within this rich, if sometimes overly sweetened, style.
</P>
<P>
   Feminine folk-pop offers specific emotional and musical
pleasures. It blends confessional singer-songwriting with vague
social idealism, finding common ground in women's personal
experiences. Emphasizing the voice and the gentle give-and-take of
ensemble playing, it ignores instrumental virtuosity and generally
avoids the catharsis of rock. Sympathy is its ultimate value, as
fans apply its messages about love and understanding to their own
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Many artists working within this traditionally feminine mode are
content to honor its ethos; the most interesting also reconfigure
it. Each of Lilith's main-stage performers attempted this, with
varying degrees of success. Inventiveness, though, is not
necessarily the quality that endears them to most fans swaying and
crooning to their favorite meaning-filled ballads. Thus, they
lightly tread the territory connecting their individualism with the
genre's equalizing demands.
</P>
<P>
   Sets on two smaller stages by up-and-coming artists, including
the flamboyant Billie Myers and the moody Spanish group Lhasa, set
the mood, but this year's emphasis is on the main stage. Ms.
O'Connor appeared there first, offering a condensed version of her
appearance at the Guinness Fleadh festival in New York City the
week before. In good voice and a chipper mood, she made the most of
a short set.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Badu also abbreviated her usual show without abandoning her
favorite themes. She broke the festival's most significant cultural
barrier by preaching her Afrocentric philosophy via a smooth blend
of hip-hop, jazz and soul, just as she does to her largely black
audiences on her own tours.
</P>
<P>
   As she extolled motherhood and thanked the Creator for her
talent, it was easy to comprehend the themes she shares with Ms.
O'Connor. Both view femininity as a spiritually rich calling that
has been tainted through abuse and seek to restore its luster
within their soothing but powerful songs. Both also sing and write
in ways that make their music as singular as their messages can be
sweeping; and although neither did anything unusual Friday, their
presence gave depth to the festival.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Indigo Girls are impressive singers, too, but despite their
conscious efforts to refresh folk-rock with new ingredients (a
sampled trip-hop beat here, a heavy-metal riff there), they remain
strongest within its most familiar parameters.
</P>
<P>
   The duo prompted many sing-alongs, balancing Amy Ray's
deep-voiced, passionate declarations against Emily Saliers' more
lightly phrased musings.
</P>
<P>
   Inviting Ms. McLachlan and K's Choice, one of the groups that
performed on a smaller stage, to join them for the traditional folk
song ``The Water Is Wide'' and Neil Young's ``Rockin' in the Free
World,'' the Indigo Girls invoked the bonding ritual of feminist
women's music festivals, spicing it up with a dash of mainstream
rock-and-roll.
</P>
<P>
   Diametrically opposed to the Indigo Girls' extroverted presence,
Ms. Merchant tapped the enduring charm of the eccentric woman
artist. In a multicolored outfit reminiscent of a Pottery Barn
catalog, spinning and curling herself into a ball, she guided her
band through her sometimes cryptic songs in a performance that was
all about her own joy in the music.
</P>
<P>
   She sang a campy version of ``If I Only Had a Brain,'' from
``The Wizard of Oz,'' and material from her older albums and the
new ``Ophelia.'' But the individual selections mattered less than
the buoyant mood she created by so gracefully dancing with her own
muse.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the very lack of such a peculiar inner sprite is what
has made Ms. McLachlan so popular; her gift is for playing an
idealized emotional Everywoman, and she took that stance once again
during her surprisingly short closing set. Revisiting hits and
presenting a few new songs, she made the sophisticated pop that is
her specialty intimate by mining the lustrous quality of her voice.
</P>
<P>
   Once in a while, she roughened up that instrument ever so
slightly, abandoning her patented comforting tone. For now, though,
she remained the quintessential feminine folk-popster, reigning at
the easily reached center of a perilously softhearted art.

HEARTY ITALIAN FARE FOR TERRIFIED TRAVELERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the Italian Dolomites, a bus driver weaved his way along a
narrow road skirting precipices, occasionally swerving to pass a
truck on a blind curve. The tape deck was playing and with one hand
the driver waved an imaginary baton, directing Pavarotti through a
difficult aria. The other hand was begrudgingly assigned to the
steering wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another bus on the high cliffs of the Amalfi coast executed
so many hairpin turns, horn blasting, that a passenger was swept
with motion sickness and three times hollered for the driver to let
him out. He finally left the bus permanently, saying he'd walk into
Amalfi.
</P>
<P>
   In Padua, confessionals in St. Anthony Cathedral were full at 10
a.m. on a Friday morning. At the saint's tomb, a wall is devoted to
photos of teenagers, grinning in front of wrecked autos. On behalf
of these lucky survivors, the same message to St. Anthony has
repeatedly been scrawled:
</P>
<P>
   ``Grazie!''
</P>
<P>
   In the streets of Rovigo, grandmothers on bicycles with infants
perched on handle-bar seats, weaved through a stream of snorting
Fiats, trucks and darting motorbikes. The grandmothers look neither
left nor right, their unhelmeted heads protected only by 40-mph
hair spray.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually none of the bicycle or scooter owners in Italy wears a
crash helmet, yet they seem completely unconcerned, despite the
fact that nobody in the country _ dating back to the invention of
the combustion engine _ has ever been detected yielding the right
of way or swerving to avoid any object other than the occasional
dead burro.
</P>
<P>
   For some reason scooter drivers turn off their headlights on
rainy nights in Rome. They are no longer scooters. They are
transformed into Stealth fighters. Even more of a threat are the
young lovers, sharing a scooter in Sorrento _ hugging, clutching,
kissing at 30 mph.
</P>
<P>
   I once asked my daughter, Kathy, how she survived the traffic
during the time she lived in Boston. She said she imagined that her
car was enclosed in a crash-proof bubble and she motored through
the roundabouts with immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Every Fiat Panda Jolly and Vespa sold in Italy is apparently
equipped with an invisible plastic bubble.
</P>
<P>
   Italy is the Land of Living Dangerously. Those who survive the
traffic threats challenge themselves by chain-smoking, eating food
afloat in olive oil and washing each bite down with healthy gulps
from $3 bottles of the local wine.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, we too survived a month of living dangerously. Once
dismounted, the Italians proved to be extremely friendly. The
scenery was breathtaking. Typical of our meals-for-two was an order
for one salad, two pastas, one veal dish, one tiramisu dessert and
a bottle of wine for $27, service included, at Osteria Gatto Nero
in Sorrento. And we avoided all careening Vespas by a safety margin
of at least six inches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grazie!'' St. Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a couple of dishes similar to those we encountered.
</P>
<P>
   Tuscan Tortellini Salad
</P>
<P>
   1 pound frozen tortellini
</P>
<P>
   1 cup frozen peas
</P>
<P>
   One-half red pepper, diced
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup green onions, chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 6-ounce can albacore tuna
</P>
<P>
   1 14-ounce can artichoke hearts
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup chopped fresh parsley
</P>
<P>
   12 black olives, sliced
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup fresh basil leaves, chopped, or 2 teaspoons
dried basil
</P>
<P>
   For the dressing
</P>
<P>
   1 clove garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup orange juice
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup low-fat sour cream
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup minced fresh basil leaves or 2 teaspoons dried
</P>
<P>
   Cook the tortellini in boiling water according to package
instructions. Drain and cool under running water. Thaw the peas
under running water.
</P>
<P>
   Dump the pasta into a bowl and top with the peas, red pepper and
onions. Drain the tuna and add to the bowl. Quarter the drained
artichoke hearts and add them to the bowl, too, along with the
parsley, olives and basil.
</P>
<P>
   To make the dressing, dump the garlic, mustard, lemon juice and
orange juice in a blender bowl. Hit the button and hold it down 30
seconds. (Hey, that sounds just like a Vespa starting up on a cold
morning.) With the blender still running, slowly pour in the olive
oil. Stop the motor, add the sour cream and basil, then blend
briefly and pour over the tortellini salad.
</P>
<P>
   Top the salad with dressing and toss a couple of times. Add salt
to taste, toss again, and refrigerate. Serve cold or at room
temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Vitello Venice
</P>
<P>
   6 veal scallops (6 ounces each)
</P>
<P>
   Two-and-one-half cups dry bread crumbs
</P>
<P>
   One-and-one-half cups sliced almonds
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup minced parsley
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons grated lemon rind
</P>
<P>
   3 egg whites, lightly beaten
</P>
<P>
   One-third cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Pound the veal (vitello in Italian) between sheets of waxed
paper until \ inch thick. Salt and pepper the meat. Lightly toast
the almonds.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the crumbs, parsley and lemon rind on a large plate. Dip
the scallops into the egg white, then into the crumb mixture,
pressing in to coat on both sides. Chill the veal on a baking sheet
for 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil or butter in a medium-hot skillet and saute the
scallops just a minute or two on each side. Remove to a warm
platter. Sprinkle with the warm almonds and serve with lemon
wedges. Serves two bus drivers and four passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry about the empty place setting. That particular
``guest'' is walking into town and will probably miss dinner.
</P>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the continuing debate over the reasons for the
dwindling of classical music audiences, the managers of opera
companies and orchestras get a bad rap. Or so says Paul Kellogg,
the general and artistic director of the New York City Opera.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, many managers are fairly perceived as willing
kowtowers to the bottom line, eager to placate their worried boards
and wealthy patrons by presenting tried-and-true repertory that the
most loyal segments of their audiences supposedly want.
</P>
<P>
   But others, Kellogg says, are adventurous souls at heart, closet
radicals who would love to try new works, take chances and
challenge their audiences, but are understandably afraid to take a
risk.
</P>
<P>
   In his own career, Kellogg, 60, has taken more risks than most,
emboldened by his belief in untapped audiences. He sees opera-goers
who are younger, hipper types who, because arts education in the
schools is so lacking, have no vested interest in the classics and
might be willing to try something new, or even something old and
unfamiliar but presented in a daring new form. If only they could
be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting recently on his two completed seasons at the helm of
the New York City Opera, Kellogg talked with messianic fervor about
that untapped audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are out there who don't know Puccini's `Boheme' from
Britten's `Paul Bunyan,''' he said. ``And they're just as likely to
come to the Britten, if they think that it be fresh and
intriguing.'' These are the people who, in other areas, Kellogg
added, first gravitate to new movies, new pop groups, new plays,
before looking to the past. ``And I think I'm reaching them.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence to support his hunch is hard to come by. How do you
survey hipness? And the hard numbers, though encouraging, are not
conclusive. For example, by advertising in campus publications, the
company alerted college students to a discount allowing them to buy
advance tickets at rush-seat prices: $10.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996-97 season, the company sold 2,460 student discount
tickets; this season the number jumped to 11,685. Impressive, yes.
But with a total of 115 performances in the 2,700-seat New York
State Theater, that means potentially more than 310,000 seats are
available.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm willing to lose money on student discounts in 1998,''
Kellogg said, ``in order to build an audience for 2008.'' In a way,
his anecdotal evidence is almost more convincing. ``I see far more
younger, more casually dressed people, and college-age couples on
big dates all dressed up the way they think you should for opera,''
he said. ``It's very noticeable, and you would not have seen that
10 years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg may be right. But he is no lone idealist. The conviction
that new audiences are waiting to be tapped and that new repertory
is one way to tap them also drives Michael Tilson Thomas, the
charismatic conductor of the San Francisco Symphony. Thomas'
programs, while fully attentive to the classics, are notable for
their high quotient of recent works, American music and neglected
20th-century repertory. Audiences there are getting younger, said
Peter Pastreich, the orchestra's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   Pastreich was not surprised by the results of a survey this
season that compared single-ticket buyers, who tend to be
last-minute purchasers, with subscription holders, for whom
symphony-going is a habit. Some 35 percent of single-ticket holders
were in the 25-35 age bracket (compared with 5 percent of regular
subscribers), and 25 percent of single-ticket holders were in the
36-44 age bracket (compared with 14 percent of subscribers).
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not scientific proof,'' Pastreich said. ``But younger
people are buying single tickets and showing up. Of course, part of
this has to do with Michael Tilson Thomas himself. Younger people
identify with his dynamism and sex appeal. They trust his
programming and have figured out that something hip is going on
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Thomas' counterpart at the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the
conductor Esa-Pekka Salonen, is also challenging his audiences with
bracing contemporary fare and drawing in new listeners. And Gerard
Mortier, the artistic director of the famously snoozy Salzburg
Festival in Austria, is shaking up the place with newly
commissioned operas and a contemporary music series, making enemies
and winning converts in the process.
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg points out that opera companies have an advantage over
orchestras in attracting new audiences: at its best, opera can be
an exciting form of theater. And the use of supertitles, which
audiences everywhere have embraced, has opened up the opera house
to people interested in a good show.
</P>
<P>
   ``To us,'' Kellogg said over lunch recently in his Lincoln
Center office, ``this means we can look for people who are
interested in theater and may have been put off by Broadway, with
its dumb spectacle.'' They just might find opera a strangely
involving type of theater, he thinks.
</P>
<P>
   Emblematic of what he wants to accomplish was the recent ``Paul
Bunyan.'' This production, imaginatively directed by Mark Lamos,
originated in 1995 at the Glimmerglass Opera, the summer festival
in Cooperstown, N.Y., that Kellogg founded in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   He still serves as artistic director at Glimmerglass, which
built its following ``not with opera's top 10 favorites,'' he said,
but by including American and contemporary works and unfamiliar
Baroque operas. ``Paul Bunyan,'' Britten's first opera and his only
collaboration with W.H. Auden, was a surprise success. ``It's a
wonderful American fable, a haunting and touching piece,'' Kellogg
said.
</P>
<P>
   So how did it fare with City Opera audiences this spring?
</P>
<P>
   For its five performances, the opera played to 70 percent
capacity. This compares with, say, the ever-popular ``Carmen,''
which had nine performance at 88 percent capacity. But, Kellogg
emphasized, before he arrived, contemporary works attracted houses
of 45 percent to at most 65 percent (the figure for the 1994
production of Hindemith's ``Mathis der Maler'').
</P>
<P>
   This spring, for the annual broadcast on the PBS ``Live From
Lincoln Center'' series, Kellogg pushed hard for ``Paul Bunyan''
and won. He intends to bring it back to the stage in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Kellogg also has strong ideas about the standard repertory.
Given that the Metropolitan Opera House is across the plaza, a City
Opera ``Boheme'' or ``Nozze di Figaro'' should offer something
distinctive; for example, instead of stars, young and eager signers
who look like the characters they portray.
</P>
<P>
   Here, as Kellogg concedes, the company has had mixed results.
There is a fine line between giving a fledgling singers a chance
and prematurely pushing them into vocally unsuitable roles.
</P>
<P>
   This season's ``Macbeth,'' a familiar but hardly standard opera,
represented Kellogg's ideal of what his company should uniquely do
with seminal 19th-century works. Critics generally praised the
performance, especially the impassioned Lady Macbeth of Lauren
Flanigan. Reaction was divided about the production, specifically
John Conklin's sets, which used shining steel platforms and
scaffolding to evoke the inner lives of these medieval Scottish
characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who came to see a Macbeth in kilts were disappointed,''
Kellogg said. ``But the audience hoping for a vivid theatrical
experience liked it immensely. Nobody familiar with the way
Shakespeare is presented in the theater these days would have been
bothered a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   It played to 77 percent capacity, which makes its fifth best for
the season.
</P>
<P>
   The attendance figures require some interpretation. Looked at
simply in terms of the number of seats sold, the great hits of
opera's past won out, topped by ``La Boheme'' at 31,600 seats,
with, in descending order, ``Carmen,'' ``La Traviata,'' ``Macbeth''
and, at 18,000, ``Madama Butterfly.''
</P>
<P>
   But some operas had more than twice the number of performances
as others, and when the percentage of the house sold (including all
performances of a particular opera) is looked at, the list is
strikingly different: Handel's ``Xerxes'' took first place (93
percent), followed by ``Carmen'' (88 percent), then the United
States premiere of the Chinese-born composer Tan Dun's 1996 opera
``Marco Polo'' (85 percent), ``La Boheme'' (83 percent) and
``Macbeth'' (77 percent).
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there were just five performances of ``Xerxes,'' only
four of ``Marco Polo'' and 13 of ``La Boheme.'' But that's to be
expected, Kellogg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people want to see the bread-and-butter operas like
`Carmen,''' he said. ``They sometimes don't even care so much how
they're sung, and that's true for Met audiences as well. These are
great works, and many people are hearing them for the first time.''
</P>
<P>
   All the contemporary works this season did fairly well in terms
of percentages, Kellogg reports, including Tobias Picker's brooding
``Emmeline'' (four performances, at a little under 70 percent). One
reason has to do with a trend that transcends opera, Kellogg
believes. ``New music is more accessible these days,'' he said.
``Musical styles are wildly more eclectic and less rigidly bound to
what is intellectually fashionable.''
</P>
<P>
   Presenting fresh repertory in stimulating productions is
central, he says. Of course, one person's stimulation is another's
gimmickry. The production of Gluck's remarkable ``Iphigenie en
Tauride,'' directed by Francesca Zambello, emphasized the
homoerotic aspect of the bonded male friendship that is at the core
of the story, drawn from the Greek drama.
</P>
<P>
   And casting two handsome young singers who spent much of the
performance in loincloths drove home that awareness. Some critics
found it stunning, and the audience on opening night responded with
a frenzied ovation, especially for Christine Goerke, a superb young
soprano, in the title role. Other critics found it sensationalized.
</P>
<P>
   Next season, Gluck's ``Orfeo ed Euridice'' will come to City
Opera in a co-production with the English National Opera, directed
and choreographed by Martha Clarke. It includes an Elysian Fields
scene for six male and six female dancers who will be completely
naked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those dancers are incredibly beautiful,'' said Kellogg, who
insists that the nudity is humane and sensitive.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, count on seats in the front rows going fast.
</P>
<P>
   Other unusual works include two American operas: Jack Beeson's
``Lizzie Borden,'' which was given its premiere by the New York
City Opera in 1965, and Carlisle Floyd's ``Of Mice and Men.'' There
will also be new productions of Handel's little-known ``Partenope''
and Strauss' seldom heard ``Intermezzo.''
</P>
<P>
   City Opera board president Mark Newhouse, who supports Kellogg's
programming ideas, said that trying to attract new audiences was
like playing the stock market. ``The day after it goes up or down,
it's easy to get 10 experts telling you what happened,'' he said.
``It's hard to figure.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Kellogg must attend to the nuts and bolts of running
a company. In a gamble, he increased this year's operating budget
by $3.5 million, to $30 million, with yearly increases expected to
follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the money has gone and will go to increasing rehearsal
time and boosting fees for artists,'' he said. ``The New York City
Opera can have the most innovative season imaginable, but, first
and foremost, we have to be good.''

 &HT;    Galarraga quietly helps other Braves bats
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ His improved home run pace is not as dramatic as,
say, Mark McGwire's or even Sammy Sosa's. Yet when Javy Lopez hit
his 16th homer here Saturday night, it put the catcher five weeks
ahead of last year's pace. Lopez never hit No. 16 last season until
July 26. Now, he's just seven behind his career high. The reason?
</P>
<P>
   The new first baseman. Andres Galarraga.
</P>
<P>
   ''For me, Galarraga's a big positive,'' said Lopez. ''He really
makes us believe the ballpark doesn't have anything to do with your
ability. Once you hit the ball, it's going to go.
</P>
<P>
   ''He really proved the ballpark doesn't matter. To me, that's a
big motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   So forget all that early-season talk last year that Turner Field
wasn't home run-friendly. ''I just tried to tell him, 'Hey, it
doesn't matter where we play, who's pitching. You just need to make
good contact,''' said Galarraga. ''He's so strong, knows how to
hit. I've said to him a couple of times, 'A catcher's got to be a
good hitter. You have an idea how they pitch.' Just little things,
make more concentration.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've said lots of times, 'I think this place (Turner Field) is
easier to hit it out than Coors Field.' I was just joking. But
maybe it helps.''
</P>
<P>
   This does, too: Galarraga's right-handed presence in the cleanup
spot, instead of the left-handed Fred McGriff. ''I see what they're
throwing him,'' said the right-handed Lopez, who hits two spots
behind Galarraga, ''and I'm hitting the pitches they throw him. I'm
also trying to take Vinny Castilla's job.''
</P>
<P>
   In Denver, the right-handed, ex-Brave Castilla also hit sixth
and fed off Galarraga for consecutive 40-homer seasons the past two
years. Galarraga's influence in Atlanta has already far surpassed
McGriff's last year.
</P>
<P>
   ''We loved Freddie but this guy has already hit as many homers
as Freddie had all last season,'' Bobby Cox said recently.
Actually, Galarraga already has 25 homers, three more than
McGriff's total last year. ''The impact has been awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He's made our lineup a lot tougher to defend if you're an
opposing manager,'' said Chipper Jones.
</P>
<P>
   WEISS HOME: Walt Weiss did not play Sunday. He flew home to
Atlanta Sunday morning to be with his seriously-ill son, Brody, 3.
Cox doesn't know when Weiss will rejoin the team. Ozzie Guillen
took Weiss' place in the lineup, leading off and playing shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   WELCOME BACK: The applause started slowly but when Dennis
Martinez came on to pitch the ninth inning Saturday night, the
ex-Expo got a standing ovation that gave Olympic Stadium something
it sorely lacks nowadays: Noise.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was great. I had a great relationship here with the fans,
the people of Montreal because we had a few good years when I
played here,'' said Martinez, who pitched here from 1986-93, won
100 of his 243 career victories, was an NL All-Star in 1990-92 and
threw a perfect game in 1991 in Los Angeles against the Dodgers.
''Plus, I guess they appreciated what I did for them on the playing
field and off.
</P>
<P>
   ''This place appreciated me more than any other place I played.
It will always be No. 1. I think it has something to do with
they're another country, like I'm from another country. They might
understand me more because we have a different culture and they
appreciate the effort on the field, win or lose. If you give them
100 per cent, they really appreciate that.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez brought his wife and two youngest children with him on
this trip. ''We really wanted to show people, 'Thank you for taking
us under your wing,''' he said. ''This is the place where I started
my second (NL) career in baseball. Everything here is great
memories. They closed that chapter (Saturday) night. Unfortunately,
I didn't have a chance to tip my hat to them. I know deep in my
heart, I was touched by the ovation. After the game, I said, 'I
hope they're not offended I didn't tip my hat.'''
</P>
<P>
   Why didn't he? Martinez was too intent on pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ETC. Sunday's crowd of 12,265 was the largest of the weekend but
brought the three-game total to just 33,768. The Braves average
home crowd in 42 dates: 38,177...Like 13 other NL teams, the Expos
have a 7:05 p.m. start for night games. Only the Braves and Mets
start at 7:40. Why don't the Braves start earlier? TV. TBS dreads
losing both the early-evening revenue from ''The Andy Griffith
Show'' at 7:05 and the later prime-time game revenue should the
Braves start earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ''Television always has an impact on our scheduling decisions,''
said assistant general manager Dean Taylor. ''There are some
revenue issues surrounding starting times. They're pretty
complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Braves fan surveys a few years ago indicated a
preference for earlier starting times for night games, midweek
games still start at 7:40 p.m. with Saturday night games at 7:10.
''Every year, when we discuss scheduling issues with TBS, one issue
we always discuss is starting times,'' said Taylor, ''in order to
give them the opportunity to make the schedule as attractive as
possible from a television standpoint. That's very important.''

 &HT;    Braves On Deck: New York Yankees
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ When: Tonight and Tuesday, 7:35 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   _ Where: Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   _ TV/radio: TBS will broadcast both games.
</P>
<P>
   _ Probable starting pitchers: Tonight _ RHP Greg Maddux (10-2,
1.62 ERA; 1-0, 1.00 lifetime vs. Yankees) vs. LHP Andy Pettitte
(8-5, 4.13; 0-0, 0.00 lifetime vs. Braves). Tuesday _ LHP Tom
Glavine (9-3, 2.75; 0-0, 0.00 lifetime vs. Yankees) vs. RHP Orlando
Hernandez (2-0, 1.52; first appearance vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   _ Series history: Atlanta leads all-time 2-1, taking two of
three interleague games last year in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   _ Past meetings: In their first encounter since the Yankees
rallied from an 0-2 deficit to win the 1996 World Series in six
games, the clubs played nine scoreless innings last June 30 in
Yankee Stadium. Andy Pettitte worked the first five for New York
and Tom Glavine all nine for Atlanta before Mike Bielecki gave up
four straight one-out singles in the 10th. The last, by Luis Sojo,
gave the Yanks a 1-0 win. The next night, Atlanta got 7-2/3 strong
innings from Denny Neagle, superb relief from Mark Wohlers and a
two-run homer from Ryan Klesko in a 3-1 victory. Klesko homered the
next afternoon, when Greg Maddux absolutely baffled the Yankees
with a three-hit, eight-strikeout, 2-0 shutout that lasted just 2
hours, 9 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Yankees leaders: Avg. _ Bernie Williams (.353). HR _ Williams,
Tino Martinez and Darryl Strawberry (10). RBI _ Martinez (51).
Steals _ Chuck Knoblauch (19). W _ David Wells and David Cone (9).
ERA _ Orlando Hernandez (1.52). Strikeouts _ Cone (81). Saves _
Mariano Rivera (16).
</P>
<P>
   _ Quickly: Baseball's best team continues to roll, even without
Williams. The center fielder is on the disabled list with a
strained right knee, but shortstop Derek Jeter returned from the DL
Friday...The Yankees have the best winning percentage in the majors
(.746), as well as the best home (26-5) and road (24-12) records.
When the Orioles took two of three from the Yanks in Baltimore this
week, it ended New York's big-league record-tying streak of 24
straight series without a loss. After losing two games to open the
season in Anaheim, the Yankees went 20-0-4 in their next 24 series
before Baltimore...The Yanks are 49-13 since starting the season
1-4...Hernandez is 2-0 since being called up from Class AAA
Columbus June 2, and El Duque gives manager Joe Torre a rotation
that rivals Atlanta's. He hasn't pitched enough to qualify, so his
1.52 ERA isn't the AL's best. Irabu's 1.68 is tops, along with his
.191 opponents' batting average...David Wells, who beat Cleveland
Saturday for his ninth win, threw a perfect game May 17 versus
Minnesota, the 14th in big-league history...The Yankees are second
in the AL in batting (.291) and pitching (3.94 ERA), third in
fielding (.984). They average 6.2 runs per game.
</P>
<P>
   _ Who's hot: Before losing his last start, Cone (9-2) had won
nine straight decisions, the majors' longest winning streak this
year. Rivera had three saves on the road trip, 16 in 19
opportunities this year. Catcher Joe Girardi has hit in a
season-high five straight games, going 7-for-15.
</P>
<P>
   _ Who's not: Tino Martinez is 5-for-his-last-33, 11-for-56.

 &HT;    Braves, Yankees get first look at each other Monday
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Bobby Cox dismisses it as a prelude to nowhere,
merely four enjoyable games. Tom Glavine urges June caution. Yet
Keith Lockhart foresees a mid-season measuring stick and there's a
sense of anticipation in the Braves clubhouse. Indeed, Andres
Galarraga can't wait to see Yankee Stadium well in advance of the
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   So folks, let the Yankees games begin.
</P>
<P>
   ''If we've heard it once, we've heard it 1,000 times: This is a
preview of the World Series,'' Glavine said of a four-game set with
the Yankees that begins tonight with two games in the Bronx, then
shifts to Atlanta Wednesday for two more. ''It's way too early to
be talking about that. There's still some teams out there who are
going to have something to say about who plays in the World Series,
whatever happens with us and the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's four games we'll enjoy because playing the Yankees is
always great, like the Red Sox and Baltimore,'' said Cox. ''Makes
the season go faster. But I haven't put one iota of energy into it.
It's certainly not a prelude to anything. That's what everybody's
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have clearly established themselves as the AL's _ if
not baseball's _ best. The Braves are again the big cheese of the
NL. Even Glavine admits it has late-October implications as a
''potential match-up.''
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a lot of pride on the line right now,'' said Glavine,
who starts Tuesday against Orlando Hernandez. ''A lot of people are
talking about them as the best team in baseball. We want to go in
and show them we're better.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves were last year, taking two of three taut, terrific
games in the Bronx. The finale was an afternoon delight for Cox: A
2-hour, 9-minute, 2-0 three-hit shutout by Greg Maddux, who opposes
Andy Pettitte tonight. There's also the lingering distaste of the
1996 World Series, when the Yankees overcame an 0-2 deficit to
celebrate at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've got a pretty unbelievable team,'' Lockhart said. ''You
hope it's going to be a good series. We can see what kind of team
we have. It should be exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially for Galarraga, who has never played in Yankee Stadium
and approaches this as advanced surveillance. ''I want to see it
before the World Series,'' he said, grinning. ''It's kind of
important. We saw them in spring training but it's not the same.
Now, we have to do some scouting: How they pitch, how they run,
what they do in (certain) situations.
</P>
<P>
   ''It works both ways. They're probably thinking the same thing.
They want to see what we have.''

`SHIP OF GOLD': A TREASURE TALE TEMPERED BY SCIENCE
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(ja) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The moment you start reading Gary Kinder's spellbinding story of
a suboceanic treasure hunt, ``Ship of Gold in the Deep Blue Sea,''
you know that the searchers are eventually going to hit it very
big. The narrative begins with the discovery in January 1848 of the
gold nugget at John Sutter's sawmill that brought on the California
Gold Rush.
</P>
<P>
   From there the story jumps to September 1857 and the journey
from Panama to New York of the Central America, a side-wheel
steamer carrying nearly 600 passengers returning from the Gold Rush
and some 21 tons of California gold worth at the time more than $13
million. Two days after a stopover in Havana, the ship ran into
what was described at the time as a storm ``of almost unprecedented
fury and violence'' and eventually sank.
</P>
<P>
   Drawing on the extensive testimony of eyewitnesses and
survivors, Kinder (``Victim: The Other Side of Murder'' and ``Light
Years: An Investigation of the Extraterrestrial Experiences of
Eduard Meier'') has reconstructed the sinking of the Central
America in harrowing and often poignant detail. But you read these
chapters a little impatiently. You itch to get on with the treasure
hunt. There's been enough of sinking ships and killer vortexes and
floating corpses in this season of Leonardo DiCaprio.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the narrative picks up pace as the scene shifts to
the town of Defiance, Ohio, in the 1960s, and you meet Tommy
Thompson, a young genius who wants to know how everything works and
who once drove his car cross-country powered with used french-fry
oil.
</P>
<P>
   Following wherever his insatiable curiosity takes him, Thompson
ends up in the business of salvaging sunken treasure ships, not so
much for the sake of fortune hunting as a way of financing the
scientific exploration of the ocean floor. Breaking down the
problems of deep-sea salvage systematically, he determines the best
approach to be the use of an unmanned, remote-control vehicle.
Rating the most feasible wrecks on a scale of risks, he and his
team arrive at the Central America as their target.
</P>
<P>
   As Kinder writes: ``It had sunk in an era of accurate record
keeping and reliable navigation instruments. Dozens of witnesses
had testified to the sinking, and five ship captains had given
coordinates that placed the ship in an area where sediment
collected no faster than a centimeter every thousand years. The
extrinsic risks looked as favorable: she had a wooden hull, which
would be easier to get into, and massive ironworks in her steam
engine and boilers that would provide a good target for sonar, even
if much of the iron had corroded and disappeared. And it was off
the coast of the United States, so they wouldn't have to negotiate
with a foreign government and they could more easily provide site
security.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if they could find the wreck, ``they would open a time
capsule representing an entire nation during a crucial period in
its formation.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Thompson wins financial backing and gets to work, the
fascination of the story lies less in whether he is going to
succeed and more in the genius of his approach. For instance, to
determine where to search with the advanced sonar device he has
leased, he and his team prepare what they called a probability map
based on the ship's last known position, variously reported at the
time of the sinking. One of these coordinates seems to make no
sense. By going to the historical record and cleverly inferring one
man's behavior during the catastrophe, the team is able to resolve
the anomaly.
</P>
<P>
   Once the search begins and a site is found that seems to be the
Central America, some members of the team insist that there is no
point in looking further. But Thompson, arguing that they have
succumbed to treasure-hunt fever, demands that the search go on and
that in the interest of scientific discipline all high-probability
sectors be scanned. It is a good thing that he persists, for as it
turns out, they are still a long way from hitting pay dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when competing hunters threaten to poach on sites that
Thompson has discovered, he is able to improvise brilliantly and to
snatch almost from under his rivals' noses what some consider the
greatest sunken treasure ever found.
</P>
<P>
   That Thompson stressed scientific discovery over fortune is one
of the main points of ``Ship of Gold.'' As Kinder concludes:
``Since 1989, he has used his new technology to provide an
opportunity never before available to science: data, specimens,
photographs, film and on-site time at sea observing and
experimenting in the deep ocean for over 150 scientists,
researchers and educators in the United States, Canada, Germany,
Monaco, England and New Zealand. They are corrosion experts,
underwater archeologists, marine biologists, marine geologists,
ocean chemists, ocean physicists, material scientists,
bacteriologists, fisheries scientists and maritime historians. The
scientists have been identifying life forms, determining life
cycles, evaluating data and providing insight.''
</P>
<P>
   This is certainly good news, but it is finally not what draws
you on through Kinder's pages and prompts you to forgive his
occasionally clunky prose and his curious omission of pictorial
material. Succumbing like Thompson's subordinates to treasure-hunt
fever, what you hunger for is the glitter of the payoff, which you
get not only as information but also in the author's striking
word-portrait of a scene glimpsed through a camera eye two miles
below the sea's surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like deep-ocean sentries, sea creatures guarded the treasure:
gorgonian corals, feathery and white, stood erect above the gold;
brisingid sea stars, a brilliant pink-orange, sprawled across piles
of yellow bricks or perched atop a single bar, their arms drooped
possessively; red anemones, their tentacles splayed, stuck to
ledges and inside crevices spilling with coins and bars. The scene
was live, yet seemed forever like a photograph: piles of gold, much
of it yellow as the night it went down, surrounded by the neighbors
it had known since that night in 1857.''
</P>
<P>
   And no one risked getting the bends or rapture of the deep.

   CHINA-CLINTON (Washington) _ As Clinton prepares for his summit

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hazy, very warm and humid conditions will cover most of the
Eastern states. A broken band of heavy showers and a few
thunderstorms will form near a weak frontal system as it moves
through the interior Northeast. Locally, heavy rain will occur in a
few locations near the central Appalachians and Middle Atlantic
states where high level winds direct a series of thunderstorms over
the same spot. Otherwise, light onshore breezes will keep the
coastal Northeast much cooler with less chance for showers than the
interior. Patches of dense coastal fog will be common from Maine to
northern Jersey, especially in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Very hot weather will persist from the southern Plains through
the Southeastern states. Sunshine will be plentiful in most of the
region; however, some strong thunderstorms will develop in the heat
of the afternoon in the Tennessee Valley. A few heavy
thundershowers will also help alleviate the unusual heat and
dryness in parts of the Florida. There will be little chance for
rain in most of Texas and Oklahoma, however, isolated late
afternoon thunderstorms will erupt in western sections.
</P>
<P>
   High pressure will promote dry and very warm conditions from the
eastern Dakotas to the southern Great Lakes. A wavering front from
the central Rockies to the Ohio Valley will be the focus for
clusters showers and thunderstorms, particularly in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The West Coast states will have plenty of sunshine, despite
patchy morning coastal clouds. A few afternoon thundershowers will
form over the high ground from the Cascades to the Bitterroots.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Hot Nights
</P>
<P>
   It was the warmest night on record in Midland, Texas, on
Saturday when the mercury fell no lower than 82 degrees.
Measurements have been taken at the western Texas town since 1930.
During the weekend, several other cities in the southern Plains and
Southeast set daily records for overnight lows. In general, warm
nights are more common than they were earlier this century.
Official readings in the modern era are typically taken in
increasingly urban environments. The concrete roads and buildings
retain the day's heat longer than the open terrain in rural areas. &QL;

   ERNIE STEWART
</P>
<P>
   _ Country: United States _ Age: 29.
</P>
<P>
   _ Position: Midfielder. _ Club team: NAC Breda (The
Netherlands).
</P>
<P>
   _ Notes: With speed and a strong scoring touch, Stewart has
developed into a regular role player for the U.S. He has been
bothered by an injury since the Germany match. One of six
European-based U.S. players, Stewart is the son of an American
military man and a Dutch sprinter. He has played his entire career
in The Netherlands. He lived in California for several years as a
child but did not play soccer. Stewart, who had a second-half goal
to clinch a 2-0 upset of Colombia in 1994, has scored 50 goals in
the Dutch pro leagues since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ALAN SHEARER
</P>
<P>
   _ Country: England. _ Age: 27.
</P>
<P>
   _ Position: Striker. _ Club team: Newcastle United (England).
</P>
<P>
   _ Notes: The captain and rugged leader of England's first World
Cup team since 1990, Shearer scored the first goal in a 2-0 win
against Tunisia. He is a strong and powerful scorer who needs
service to excel, and teamed up well with Teddy Sheringham in the
opener. Without it, he is nearly useless, as evidenced in
Newcastle's loss to Arsenal in the FA Cup finals in May. Shearer
missed most of last season with a bone fracture in his right leg
and hasn't quite fully mended.
</P>
<P>
   TODAY
</P>
<P>
   11:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia vs. Tunisia
</P>
<P>
   (ESPN, Univision)
</P>
<P>
   This may be the end of the line for Colombia, which needs three
points to stay alive in Group G. Coach Hernan Dario Gomez last week
kicked striker Fausino Asprilla off the team for a lack of respect,
then announced his own resignation once the World Cup is over.
Tunisia doesn't have much, but it could be a spoiler by forging a
tie.
</P>
<P>
   3 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Romania vs. England
</P>
<P>
   (ESPN, Univision)
</P>
<P>
   The best matchup of Group G _ and the two teams likely to
advance. England looked strong in beating Tunisia, but this will be
a stronger challenge from Romania's creative squad, especially
Gheorge Hagi and Adrian Ilie. The new faces for England passed
their first test, but they can't afford to miss on scoring chances
as they did against Tunisia.
</P>
<P>
   Rule book: Getting Fancy
</P>
<P>
   Although players can be called for fouls or be issued cards for
showing their spikes, a bicycle kick is a permissible way to try to
score as long as it doesn't endanger other players. U.S. defender
Marcelo Balboa nearly scored against Colombia in 1994 on a bicycle
kick that makes soccer's perpetual highlight reels. In this World
Cup, Mexico's Cuauhtemoc Blanco squeezed between South Korean
defenders on two occasions by pulling the ball up with both feet
and holding it during his jump. A back-heel pass is another way
attackers try to skirt opposing defenses _ and induce gasps from
the crowd.

`LE CORSAIRE:' ADVENTURE OF PIRATES, PASHAS AND VIRTUOSOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Too many cooks usually spoil the bouillabaisse and
borscht. But ``Le Corsaire,'' an adventure yarn of a 19th-century
French-Russian ballet, turned into an overnight hit for American
Ballet Theater, thanks to a felicitous gaggle of producers and
coaches from two continents.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see why the work looked so spectacular on Friday
night at the Metropolitan Opera House when the company presented
its first staging of a three-act ``Corsaire.'' The production,
based on a 1997 Boston Ballet version, is a fabulous machine for
dancing.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the Kirov Ballet from Russia could field such depth of
talent in all the leading roles in its own full-evening
``Corsaire'' here in 1989 as Ballet Theater did this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The first cast on Friday was led by Nina Ananiashvili as Medora,
the Greek girl abducted by a slave dealer, and Giuseppe Picone, a
revelation in his dancing as Conrad, Medora's pirate lover.
</P>
<P>
   Wonderfully assertive but careful to keep a clean classical
line, Picone was all flair and flourish. Trained in his native
Italy and most recently a member of the English National Ballet, he
has slowly worked up to his matinee-idol image in this, his first
season with Ballet Theater. Sex appeal is the secret here. But as
with Rudolph Valentino in the tango, it's the dancing that counts.
</P>
<P>
   A pirate who points his toes perfectly? Not to worry. The story
is less important in ``Le Corsaire'' than the choreography, whose
most classical vestiges are derived from Marius Petipa's 1899
version for the Maryinsky Ballet in St. Petersburg, Russia.
</P>
<P>
   The jewel-like pas de trois for three odalisqes in pale blue
tutus and bare midriffs is the supreme example and featured Gillian
Murphy, a corps member who brought the house down on Saturday night
with her triple and quadruple pirouettes as well as her
astonishingly precise leg beats.
</P>
<P>
   But from the moment the curtain rose on Vladimir Malakhov, as
the slave dealer bursting with energy in a Turkish bazaar, it was
clear that this was to be an all-star evening. Angel Corella was
Birbanto, a fiery pirate in a character-dance role that has been
enhanced with extra bravura.
</P>
<P>
   Ashley Tuttle had the supporting classical role as Gulnare,
another slave captive, and Jose Manuel Carreno, was splendid in the
role Rudolf Nureyev made famous as the slave lying at Margo
Fonteyn's feet in the pas de deux known for short as ``Le
Corsaire.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as the Kirov taught us, this pas de deux was originally a
pas de trois, and here again Medora was alternately partnered by
Conrad, who gets an extra solo, and Carreno, dancing the familiar
choreography as Ali, Conrad's slave.
</P>
<P>
   To get through the web of characters has not been easy, even for
19th-century choreographers. The Ballet Theater ``Corsaire'' is the
latest of many versions. The Boston Ballet production is itself
based on a 1992 version for the Bolshoi Ballet by Konstantin
Sergeyev, onetime star and director of the Kirov.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin McKenzie, Ballet Theater's artistic director, requested
that the Boston production be tightened and made more dramatically
coherent. Anna-Marie Holmes, the Boston Ballet's new director, has
restaged that production with past or present members of the Kirov:
Tatyana Legat, Tatyana Terekhova and Serge Berejnoi (now a ballet
master at the Boston Ballet).
</P>
<P>
   One result is that more dancing gets crammed into Act I, and the
evening gets off to an uplifting start that telegraphs the virtue
of this version: entertainment pure and simple. Malakhov, as
Lankendem, the slave dealer, makes something major of a potentially
minor role, never overdoing the comic potential of his villain,
always giving his solos an extraordinary flexibility and lightness.
</P>
<P>
   This was especially true in the ``Pas d'Esclave'' pas de deux
where Miss Tuttle, initially veiled, shielded her face from him
while showing off first-class classical form. ``Le Corsaire'' very
loosely derived from a poem by Byron, has the same mix of character
and classical dancing of all 19th-century spectaculars.
</P>
<P>
   This eclecticism was clear from the start when Corella's power
came to the fore. His energy never flagged even when he and
Elizabeth Ferrell, dancing excellently, led two ensembles in what
looked like a hodgepodge of various ethnic dances.
</P>
<P>
   Pride of place belongs nonetheless to the classical set pieces.
Ms. Ananiashvili, carried in veiled and sold to a pasha, danced
with customary amplitude but she could also tease the same resident
pasha, subtly acted by Michael Owen, with delightfully detailed
small steps.
</P>
<P>
   Oksana Konobeyeva and Sandra Brown did well enough Friday as two
of the odalisqes and came closer to Ms. Murphy's stunning level
Saturday night. When Conrad rescued Medora and took her to his
pirate lair, Carreno was his magnificent virtuoso self in the pas
de trois with Ms. Ananiashvili, dancing in full ballerina mode, and
Picone.
</P>
<P>
   To suggest the choreography is all Petipa is to forget the many
Soviet ballet masters who changed the ballet over the decades. The
love duet for Medora and Conrad in the grotto is in a fluent Soviet
style, and even most of the male choreography was created in the
Soviet era. But when Birbanto leads a mutiny and Medora is returned
to the pasha, one can believe that Petipa's choreography is still
visible in the pasha's dream.
</P>
<P>
   Here Ms. Ananiashvili and Miss Tuttle led units of little girls
and a female corps in a symmetrical floral arrangement, the
divertissement known as ``Jardin Anime.'' It was lovely.
</P>
<P>
   And so was Julie Kent, leading Saturday night's cast and hitting
her stride in Act II with an unexpectedly subdued Carreno as Conrad
and a polished Picone as Ali. John Selya as Birbanto, was splendid
in his exceptional vigor and Paloma Herrera gave Gulnare a superbly
girlish dazzle. Charles Barker conducted the eclectic score by five
19th-century composers.

MUSIC REVIEW: CARAMOOR CONDUCTORS PUT BEL CANTO FIRST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   KATONAH, N.Y. _ In a profession in which ego plays a significant
and undoubtedly essential role, the conductors at the Caramoor
International Music Festival here seem a surprisingly selfless lot.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Oundjian, a violinist turned conductor, in this, the first
season he programmed as artistic director of the festival, ceded
its opening night Saturday night to Will Crutchfield and the bel
canto program he started last season.
</P>
<P>
   And Crutchfield, after an opening romp through the Overture to
Cimarosa's ``Matrimonio Segreto'' with the resident Orchestra of
St. Luke's, was content to play a backup role to operatic singers,
led by June Anderson, and to Soovin Kim, a violinist.
</P>
<P>
   As the main offering, the second half of the program consisted
of goodly chunks of Bellini's ``Norma,'' with Ms. Anderson in the
title role. A thunderstorm at the start merely heightened the
drama, and the heavy patter of rain on the tent of the Venetian
Theater gave the sense of a classic voice heard through the surface
noise of an old 78-rpm record.
</P>
<P>
   This sense was heightened by a certain fragile quality that has
entered Ms. Anderson's voice with wear. It remains a beautiful
instrument, however, and proved fully in its element here.
</P>
<P>
   With no stage trappings to help, Ms. Anderson pulled a listener
into the heart of the drama of the tormented Druid heroine through
sheer force of voice and personality. She drew from a rich palette
of colorations and achieved a consistent beauty of tone in haunting
quiet passages as well as in forceful outpourings. She was well
supported by a handful of other singers, led by Marguerite Krull, a
soprano who, as Adalgisa, sang elegantly and complemented Ms.
Anderson ideally as they traced the sinuous interflow in the duets
of the opening scene of Act II.
</P>
<P>
   Crutchfield gave the singers plenty of room to work, leading the
orchestra and a well-prepared Festival Chorus with flexible pace
and firm control of dynamics.
</P>
<P>
   He also did his work well in the first half of the program,
where matters were not always so happy. Ms. Anderson sang two
Mozart numbers, rising decently to Donna Anna's ``Non mi dir'' from
``Don Giovanni'' despite some sharpness of pitch and unevenness in
coloratura. Her vocalism sat heavily on ``L'amero, saro costante,''
from ``Il Re Pastore,'' though she introduced imaginative
ornamentation into the repeat of the opening.
</P>
<P>
   Kim, who rendered the obbligato violin part in that aria
stiffly, took center stage in Paganini's Violin Concerto No. 2 and
played it well: no small accomplishment in view of the work's
fiendish difficulties. But more is needed to make the tricks seem
more than calisthenics, to engage rather than merely entertain the
listener. It is a matter of temperament, which the young Kim may
acquire with experience.
</P>
<P>
   The Cimarosa overture was delightful. Here and everywhere else,
Crutchfield showed a fine rapport with the Orchestra of St. Luke's,
which never fails to impress with its versatility. Apart from an
occasional insecure attack or release and, in the Paganini, some
harshness in string ascents, there was little fault to find.
</P>
<P>
   Crutchfield, this time as pianist, is to present a Rossini
evening with Vivica Genaux, a soprano, on Friday, and Oundjian is
to conduct a varied orchestral program Saturday. The season runs to
Aug. 9.

   WRONG TRANSLATION
</P>
<P>
   This is Croatia's first World Cup, one in which the Balkan
nation, freed from the yoke of hated Yugoslavia in 1991, proudly
has been showing off its independent checkerboard stripes.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the indignation of Croatia coach Miroslav Blazevic and
his players when they arrived at a press conference following
Saturday's 1-0 win over Japan and were greeted by a Serbian
translator.
</P>
<P>
   When a Croatian diplomat offered to translate instead of a young
FIFA-assigned female volunteer from Belgrade, he was immediately
reproached.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a FIFA press conference,'' FIFA's Markus Siegler said.
``Even if the lady speaks with a Serb accent, I'm not going to
allow any politics in here.''
</P>
<P>
   But Croatian team spokesman Darko Tironi insisted that had
already happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are two different languages,'' he said. ``We will make a
complaint to FIFA.''
</P>
<P>
   FIFA assigned the translator.

score is a standard three shrieks of GOOOOOOOOOOAL! _ even in Major
League Soccer. But when Mexico's Cuauhtemoc Blanco scored a
riveting goal Saturday to tie Belgium, Cantor was so awash in
excitement that he threw in a fourth rendition. Elapsed time: 11
seconds.

   PARREIRA BOOTED
</P>
<P>
   Coaching Saudi Arabia is like managing for George Steinbrenner.
After he lost his first two World Cup matches, coach Carlos Alberto
Parreira has been told not to bother showing up for his third, a
meaningless finale Wednesday against South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Parreira, who led Brazil to the 1994 title, was fired on
Saturday and will be replaced with Mohammed al-Khuraishi for the
South Africa match. Saudi Arabia, the first team to be eliminated,
has gone through eight coaches in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Parreira was hired away from the New York/New Jersey MetroStars
of MLS.
</P>
<P>
   SCOTS GO HOME
</P>
<P>
   Scottish fans started off the World Cup enjoying some hearty
digs at England and its infamous hooligans. Now, Team Braveheart
followers have been stained.
</P>
<P>
   Several dozen troublemakers arrived in Glasgow Saturday after
being kicked out of both France and Spain for various incidents
that usually involved beer, nightclubs, arrests and property
damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The atmosphere in the airport was, frankly, ugly,'' said a
27-year-old male Glaswegian about waiting with them to board a
flight from Salou, Spain.

virtually everything President Clinton does _ every step he takes,

who will have scheduled every second of his trip. After spending

   BANKRUPTCY _ WASHINGTON _ By setting aside tobacco legislation
that would have increased costs for smokers, the Senate cleared the
way last week to consider a bill that will raise the ante for
people whose debts are driving them into bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the tobacco debate, which barely touched on smokers'
responsibility for their habits, the debate over tightening
bankruptcy rules is likely to focus on consumers' responsibility
for paying their bills.

   ``Every time a deadbeat does not pay his bills, that means
working people have to pay more'' for consumer goods, mortgages and
other credit, said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, who passionately
supports making bankruptcy proceedings more difficult for people
who can pay part of their debts.(Harlan, Cox News Service).

ACCOUNTS AND PEOPLE IN THE ADVERTISING WORLD

<P>
   Two Big Clients Consolidate Accounts
</P>
<P>
   Two advertisers have consolidated accounts.
</P>
<P>
   First Brand Corp. in Danbury, Conn., named McCann-Erickson New
York to handle consolidated duties for Glad plastic products, STP
automotive products and four cat litter brands. Combined billings
were estimated at $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came after a three-month review that had been
narrowed to four finalists, all of New York: McCann-Erickson, part
of the McCann-Erickson World Group unit of Interpublic Group of
Cos., which handles Scoop Away, Ever Clean, Jonny Cat and Ever
Fresh cat litters; Young &AMP; Rubicam Advertising, which handles STP;
Bozell Worldwide, part of True North Communications, and J. Walter
Thompson, a unit of WPP Group PLC.
</P>
<P>
   Glad had been handled by the Leo Burnett USA unit of Leo Burnett
Co. in Chicago, which resigned on June 12 because a conflict
prevented the agency from taking part in the review for the
consolidated account.
</P>
<P>
   And Kaiser Permanente in Oakland, Calif., named Rapp Collins
Worldwide in New York to handle its consolidated national direct
response account, with billings estimated at $24 million. The
account had been split among nine agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came after a three-month review that had been
narrowed to Rapp Collins, part of Omnicom Group, and one other
finalist: Grey Direct in New York, part of Grey Advertising, which
continues as agency of record for Kaiser Permanente brand
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Top Awards for Cliff Freeman
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in at least 20 years, one agency won Best of
Show in the broadcast and print categories at the American
Advertising Awards, sponsored by the American Advertising
Federation in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   At the presentation on Saturday night of the 30th annual Addy
Awards, which came during the federation's national conference in
Minneapolis, Cliff Freeman &AMP; Partners in New York, part of Saatchi
&AMP; Saatchi PLC, won the broadcast award for work for Fox Sports
Network, part of News Corp., and the print award for an ad for
Sauza Conmemorativo tequila, marketed by the Domecq Importers unit
of Allied Domecq PLC. Freeman also won seven other Addys for work
for accounts including Staples Inc. and Little Caesar Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Fallon McElligott in Minneapolis won seven Addys for clients
including BMW of North America and the Time magazine unit of Time
Warner Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Shuffling Done by 2 Advertisers
</P>
<P>
   Two advertisers have changed agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Hershey Foods Corp. in Hershey, Pa., expanded its relationship
with the New York office of DDB Needham Worldwide by naming the
agency to handle advertising for its retail pasta brands, which had
been handled by Pedone &AMP; Partners in New York. Billings were
estimated at $5 million to $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   DDB Needham New York, a unit of Omnicom Group that has worked
for Hershey since 1978, was awarded the pasta assignment _ brands
like Ronzoni, San Giorgio, American Beauty and Skinner _ without a
formal review. The agency has handled other Hershey accounts like
Kit Kat and York Peppermint Pattie candy and Hershey's Syrup.
</P>
<P>
   And Star Markets in Cambridge, Mass., named Heater Advertising
in Boston to handle its account, with billings estimated at $5
million to $8 million. The account had been handled by the Boston
office of North Castle Partners, which closed. The decision came
after a monthlong review in which the other participants were not
disclosed.

`BOB AND MARGARET': ABSOLUTELY UNFABULOUS BUT MUDDLING THROUGH 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(lb) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the past year, viewers have been identifying with people made
of construction paper, colored ink or computer keystrokes. Fox's
hit ``King of the Hill,'' about a suburban family in Texas, and
Comedy Central's ``South Park,'' the M-rated phenomenon about
grammar school boys, have made animated comedies a major prime-time
trend and have shown how easy it is to see ourselves in cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   With so little realism on the surface, animated characters can
sneak up and irreverently hit plenty of nerves. The dunderheaded
fathers of ``The Simpsons'' or ``King of the Hill,'' much less the
boys of ``South Park,'' would never get on the air if they were
breathing actors.
</P>
<P>
   Now Comedy Central has come along with a wry animated series
that qualifies as the anti-``South Park.'' ``Bob and Margaret,''
about a middle-aged English couple, is as gently humorous and
grown-up as ``South Park'' is boisterous and adolescent, and the
new series may go further than any other in turning commonplace
behavior into humor.
</P>
<P>
   How unglamorous are Bob and Margaret? He is a dentist, she is a
podiatrist, and a typical plot might center on going to a gym
(which they desperately need and barely survive) or being robbed.
(Their favorite flowered teapot is stolen, but, on the bright side,
a bit of insurance fraud lets them trade up to a big-screen
television with Surroundsound.)
</P>
<P>
   With its bold visual look and understated humor, ``Bob and
Margaret'' brings to mind Nick Park's hilarious, inventive films
about Wallace and Gromit, a soft-spoken Englishman and his much
smarter dog. Drawn in broad strokes, the characters in ``Bob and
Margaret'' have large jaws, lumpy bodies, crazy hair.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret looks as if she has two croissants sticking out from
the side of her head, while Bob has a corkscrew on top of his.
Based on ``Bob's Birthday,'' which won the 1995 Academy Award for
best animated short, the series lacks the inspired lunatic touches
of ``Wallace and Gromit,'' but has an appealing, close-to-the-bone
wit of its own.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday's episode, Bob panics when a handsome young dentist
with sparkling new equipment moves into an office across the street
from his. It can't help that one of Bob's dental tools resembles a
pizza cutter; the series' exaggerations often come in such small
touches.
</P>
<P>
   When Margaret chips her tooth, Bob can't find time to fix it, so
she literally crosses the street and has the new dentist take care
of her. Of course, Bob discovers her infidelity. ``You drove me to
him, you drove me to see another dentist,'' Margaret cries, bawling
great swaths of pale blue tears as she runs into the bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I neglected your tooth,'' Bob apologizes, standing
outside the locked door. ``I was just so busy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob and Margaret'' usually goes along calmly until it hits one
of those priceless sequences, its lines expressed with massive
understatement. In a future episode, Bob and Margaret play sports
with another couple, only to have one of their partners land in the
hospital, victim of a tragic badminton accident. ``We'll have to
have a rematch as soon as Ken comes out of his coma,'' Bob says
soothingly.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Each episode ends with a calamitous revelation (quite a serious
one about what the new dentist might have done to Margaret) or a
disaster about to occur. These incidents are not picked up next
time, just allowed to hover like a dark cloud.
</P>
<P>
   With ``South Park,'' ``Bob and Margaret'' and ``Dr. Katz''
(which begins a new season Monday), Comedy Central virtually
controls prime-time animation, but Fox is on its heels. That
network's most promising new series, planned as midseason
replacements next year, are animated (one with Eddie Murphy's
voice). Sounding real, it seems, may be more important than having
a human body.

BUFFETT MAY BE BUYING SECOND OPINIONS ALONG WITH GENERAL RE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By EDWARD WYATT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It could be Warren Buffett's biggest challenge yet.
</P>
<P>
   Not the acquisition of General Re Corp., the reinsurance giant
that Berkshire Hathaway Inc. agreed to buy last week for $21.7
billion in stock. Rather, his taking on the often-unruly Wall
Street professionals who, as part of the deal, will become holders
of 15 percent of the shares of Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett's
far-flung corporate empire.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Buffett has enjoyed a luxury unknown to most other
American chief executives. He answers almost exclusively to
individual investors, roughly 150,000 average Americans who have
often paid premium prices to invest by his side as holders of
Berkshire Hathaway stock. But institutional investors _ the
professionals who manage portfolios for mutual funds, college
endowments and big corporations _ have almost wholly avoided
Berkshire.
</P>
<P>
   With the purchase of General Re, Berkshire Hathaway will gain an
entirely new class of shareholders: the institutions that now own
some 85 percent of General Re's shares.
</P>
<P>
   Those professional investors, if they decide to remain long-term
holders, are more likely to ask pointed questions about Buffett's
plans for Berkshire, his investment outlook and who will be running
the company after he departs. The clash of values created by that
collision of Main Street and Wall Street could be one of the most
interesting experiments to hit Omaha, Neb., in years.
</P>
<P>
   Institutional investors have not avoided Buffett's company
because they do not believe in the magic of the man from Omaha.
Rather, Berkshire shares are relatively illiquid. Only about 200 of
the company's class A shares, which trade for $80,900 apiece,
change hands on the New York Stock Exchange each day. That has made
big professional investors, who demand stocks that can be traded
easily and quickly, loath to invest.
</P>
<P>
   Even the company's class B shares, first offered two years ago
as a cheaper alternative to improve the stock's liquidity, can, at
$2,705 a share, sometimes prove hard to buy and sell.
</P>
<P>
   Institutions have also stayed away because individuals, in their
eagerness to own what Buffett owns, have often pushed the price of
Berkshire's stock far above the value of the assets owned by the
company.
</P>
<P>
   Berkshire Hathaway is not, of course, the average corporation.
It is a fanciful conglomerate that combines Main Street businesses
that seem to personify Buffett's homespun image _ like See's
Candies, International Dairy Queen and World Book Encyclopedias _
with big stakes in some of corporate America's crown jewels, like
Coca-Cola Co., Walt Disney Co. and Gillette Co.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference on Friday to announce the acquisition,
Buffett sounded sanguine about the change in his constituency. ``We
would hope that what we do at Berkshire makes enough sense to
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the benefits of the merger would be to create ``a
substantially larger float'' in Berkshire shares, Buffett said _
referring to the number of shares in general circulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there will be more trading'' as a result, he added,
perhaps making institutions ``more willing to own Berkshire.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the end of March, five institutions each owned more than 3
percent of General Re's shares, according to Technimetrics Inc.,
which tracks institutional stock data. Capital Research and
Management, which oversees the American Funds family of mutual
funds, was the largest holder, owning 6 percent of the shares,
followed by Fidelity Investments, the Regents of the University of
California, Davis Selected Advisers and Invesco Capital Management.
</P>
<P>
   Among mutual funds with big stakes in General Re were Washington
Mutual Investors, the Investment Company of America and Fundamental
Investors, each part of the American Funds family; the Fidelity
Magellan fund, and Davis New York Venture fund.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, only one institutional investor owns more than 3
percent of Berkshire Hathaway's class A shares: Ruane Cunniff &AMP;
Co., a New York investment firm whose principals, Richard Cunniff
and William J. Ruane, manage the Sequoia Fund and are longtime
friends of Buffett. And the only institution with more than 3
percent of Berkshire's class B shares at the end of March was
Warburg Pincus Asset Management, with 3.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett hinted that he hoped those big professional investors
would stay around _ as long as they let him run the show: ``We may
well develop a base of institutional investors who subscribe to the
same philosophy that our individual investors have.''
</P>
<P>
   One subject likely to interest those institutional investors is
what happens to Berkshire Hathaway after Buffett, who is 67,
retires or dies. General Re's board had similar questions in
considering the merger, Buffett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shared some views with them about what will happen with my
shares in the company on my death and after my wife dies,'' Buffett
said. ``There is a plan in terms of succession to the jobs that
Charlie and I have,'' Buffett said, referring to Charles Munger,
vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway. While he did not offer
specifics, Buffett said, ``I know the General Re directors felt the
chances were good of having a favorable environment for General Re
to operate for the next 30 to 40 years, and that they couldn't do
any better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Ferguson, chairman and chief executive of General Re, who
will become a Berkshire director as part of the merger, said,
however, that except concerning the operations of General Re, he is
not in line to play any part in those succession plans.
</P>
<P>
   Institutions might also wonder what Buffett is going to do with
the $24 billion in new investment capital that will come into the
company from General Re's operations. Only about $5 billion of that
is invested in common stocks currently, Buffett said, with the
balance in fixed income, and the biggest portion of that in
municipal bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett, who recently has said that he has had a hard time
finding cheap stocks to buy, admitted that he did not yet know the
answer to that.

   ``This deal is not being done to create cash in the till to
seize opportunities that we couldn't seize before,'' he said. ``I
don't have a lot of great ideas, or even a lot of good ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   And of the additional money, he said, ``It's not going to make
me any smarter.''

JOAO GILBERTO: TO LOVE AND YOUTH, WITH REGRET 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Joao Gilberto may well be the coolest man alive. The
unassuming, bespectacled, 67-year-old singer walked on stage
without introduction or ceremony at Carnegie Hall on Friday, sat
down with his guitar and proceeded to play one quietly haunting
bossa nova after another for 90 minutes, putting a preternatural
hush over the sold-out audience.
</P>
<P>
   He sang as if he were alone, communing with his guitar. His
fingers brushed featherweight syncopated chords; his voice, just
above a whisper, contemplated love and music, beauty and sadness.
During songs and between them, he hunched over his guitar, nearly
motionless but for his restless, knowing fingers. Every so often he
would swing one knee to his own irresistible rhythms. And once,
just once, he smiled.
</P>
<P>
   Gilberto has been the definitive bossa nova singer since he made
``Chega de Saudade'' (``No More Blues''), the pioneering bossa nova
hit, in 1958. The music was a nonchalant revelation; it transformed
the booming, extroverted samba into a private meditation,
sophisticated yet disarmingly intimate.
</P>
<P>
   Gilberto's repertory has come from Antonio Carlos Jobim, Dorival
Caymmi and other brilliant composers; he lends the songs a luminous
gentleness, at once concentrated and serene. Now, in a rare tour to
mark the 40th anniversary of that first single, Gilberto was
teasing out new secrets from his earliest songs.
</P>
<P>
   When Gilberto first recorded the classic bossa novas, they were
young men's music. The guitar held the sound of waves rolling in on
Rio de Janeiro's sunny beaches; the singing hinted at urbane
flirtations and a prevailing optimism, even when the lyrics
professed heartbreak or ``saudade,'' the untranslatable Portuguese
word for wistful, nostalgic sadness.
</P>
<P>
   Gilberto's voice is still almost weightless, but it's not as
smooth now as it was; there are scratches in it, and its lower
notes can shade into husky ambiguity.
</P>
<P>
   When he sang at Carnegie Hall about the unattainable beauty of
``Garota de Ipanema'' (``The Girl From Ipanema'') or a broken
wedding vow in ``Aos Pes da Cruz'' (``By the Holy Cross''), his
tone held more memories and more regrets. His one song in English,
the Gershwins' ``S'Wonderful,'' was a study in longing.
</P>
<P>
   He circled in on the songs, singing through the verses
straightforwardly and then returning to them more freely, letting
his voice float and drift away from the dependable pulse of his
guitar, as if he was still mulling over how he should feel.
</P>
<P>
   Every so often, he turned to scat-singing, like a muffled
trombone. His voice and guitar achieved subtle, impish feats of
timing and harmony, though he never flaunted them. Yet he was so
understated that any modest musical variation, like a key change or
a shift in his guitar rhythm, arrived like a thunderclap.
</P>
<P>
   When Bebel Gilberto, his daughter, joined him for a final
encore, she showed how radical Gilberto's reticence had been. She
made phrases crest and subside; she made eye contact with the
audience. But after her father's solo performance, she seemed to be
trying too hard, creating a diversion from his unwavering purity.

CALIFORNIA: POSITIONING FOR 2000 AT STAKE

   California: Positioning for 2000 At Stake
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, at a fund-raising dinner in Beverly Hills, President
Clinton said that 1998 provided Democrats with the first good
opportunity in ``quite a long time'' to capture the governorship of
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``And believe me,'' he added, an edge to his voice, ``we don't
need to blow it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was talking about something more than simply taking back
the governor's office of the nation's most populous state. What is
at stake in this fall's contest goes well beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   The next governor of California will preside over the redrawing
of the state's congressional boundaries after the 2000 census. He
will be in a position to approve or veto or force a compromise on
whatever reapportioning plan the Legislature comes up with for the
50-odd House districts in the state, slightly over half of them now
in Democratic hands.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, political pros say, the new governor's decision on
where lines should be redrawn and what political makeup should
result in each district could help his party pick up as many as a
dozen additional House seats _ and maybe even control of the House
of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   In no other state are the reapportionment stakes so high. And in
no other state are the Democratic and Republican national parties
pouring in as much money and effort to elect a governor and, for
that matter, a Legislature that will be on his side once
redistricting actually begins.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has told California Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, the Democrats'
gubernatorial nominee, that he will shortly be back for more
campaigning and fund-raisers. Likewise, Vice President Al Gore
plans at least three trips to the state to help out _ visits that
won't hurt him one bit with California Democrats come the next
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Republican gubernatorial nominee, state Attorney
General Dan Lungren, he is being helped in his campaign by a number
of major party figures, some of whom also have an eye on the next
presidential race.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush and his father, the former president,
have held no fewer than five Lungren fund-raisers. Former Tennessee
Gov. Lamar Alexander has formed a Lungren fund-raising committee.
And former Rep. Jack Kemp, the 1996 Republican vice presidential
nominee, has headlined several Lungren galas.
</P>
<P>
   Both Sides Blinked In Nevada Showdown
</P>
<P>
   There's a new twist in the struggle over whether unions should
be able to spend members' dues on political causes without first
getting written permission.
</P>
<P>
   Labor won the first skirmish earlier this month, defeating a
California ballot initiative that would have required unions to
collect permission slips before spending any dues money on
politics. Labor leaders argued that the aim of the initiative, and
all others like it around the country, was to cripple the ability
of unions to recruit members and wield influence in the political
arena.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative's supporters argued it was a ``worker
protection'' measure.
</P>
<P>
   After the California victory, unions began gearing up to fight
similar ballot initiatives and legislative proposals in Colorado,
Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon and elsewhere. But the fight had hardly
been joined in Nevada when suddenly, last Tuesday, both sides
declared a truce and retreated from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   The Nevada initiative, put forth by Republican leaders, first
ran into trouble two weeks earlier when a state judge declared it
unconstitutional on the ground that it violated the First Amendment
right of association. He ordered election officials not to put it
on the November ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The measure's supporters vowed to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, union and Democratic leaders proposed a ballot
initiative that would prohibit any state regulation of union dues
and also would require all political candidates and parties to make
full disclosure of all contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Nevadans, it seemed, were about to be treated to dueling
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   It never happened.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, facing the prospect that the duel would eat up money
and energy that might better be spent on local, state and Federal
election contests this fall, both sides pulled back their measures,
though not without some internal bickering in each camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a victory for everyone when we walk away alive,'' John
Mason, the chairman of the Nevada Republican Party, said after the
truce agreement was signed.
</P>
<P>
   An Endorsement, Of Sorts, for Gore
</P>
<P>
   Even as the dues spending fight was ending in Nevada, it was
picking up momentum in New Jersey, where Gore appeared in Elizabeth
last Monday to help labor leaders raise money for the struggle. But
that's not the news from that event.
</P>
<P>
   The news is what AFL-CIO president John Sweeney had to say about
the vice president, who not too long ago was no great favorite of
labor, given his outspoken support for the North American Free
Trade Agreement and its provisions for encouraging manufacturing
and job growth beyond this country's borders.
</P>
<P>
   First, Sweeney introduced Gore as ``the business agent for
today's unions.'' Then, with Gore basking in the glow of that high
praise, Sweeney soared even higher and waxed:
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore is the most prominent American leader since Franklin
Delano Roosevelt to be so strong in his advocacy on behalf of
workers.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a long way to Election 2000, and one introduction does not
a Presidential endorsement make, but ...
</P>
<P>
   Mixed Results On Term Limits
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of term limits have been unusually active this year.
In just about every state they have pressed candidates, especially
congressional candidates, to pledge to serve only a limited time in
office. Those candidates who have refused to make such a vow have
been sharply chastised in costly newspaper and broadcast
advertising campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   To what end?
</P>
<P>
   Clear-cut examples of specific legislators being elected or
turned out of office are hard to come by. For every claim of
success there is at least one other claim of failure.
</P>
<P>
   And what of passage of new term-limits laws, previously an area
in which term-limits advocates have enjoyed much success?
</P>
<P>
   Consider:
</P>
<P>
   On the June 2 primary ballot in California, voters were asked to
consider an initiative that instructed members of Congress to push
for passage of a constitutional amendment to limit congressional
terms. Pending adoption of that limit, candidates would be asked to
sign pledges of support for term limits and those who refused would
be publicly identified in ballot material.
</P>
<P>
   The measure's backers conceded even before it was placed on the
ballot that it might be unconstitutional, given that courts have
said that states must not interfere with federal election
procedures. But never mind, voters were told, give the measure a
shot anyway and, come the fall, a ``superior'' substitute would be
on the ballot, one that could withstand any legal challenge.
</P>
<P>
   The June initiative passed, narrowly, and presumably it now
faces a legal challenge.
</P>
<P>
   But come November there will be no ``superior'' substitute to
vote on. The term-limits forces may have succeeded in passing an
``inferior'' June initiative but they failed to come up with the
433,269 petition signatures required to win a place on the November
ballot for the ``superior'' substitute.
</P>
<P>
   Officials for U.S. Term Limits, one of the leading backers of
the substitute, characterized the failure as a ``minor setback.''
</P>
<P>
   POLITICAL CALENDAR: Primaries will be held in Utah on Tuesday
and there will be primary runoffs that day in Mississippi, New
Mexico and South Carolina.

`ARIANNA': A LAMENT PRESERVED, BUT ACCOMPANIED BY PARODY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo.)   (bl)  
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS, Mo. _ Revisiting works of the past can be a thankless
job for a composer, because listeners tend to regard an earlier
composer's thought process as sacrosanct and a later composer's
additions as intrusive.
</P>
<P>
   It was not always thus: Mozart reorchestrated Handel's
``Messiah,'' and Liszt and Busoni expanded on works by Schubert and
Bach without causing an outcry.
</P>
<P>
   But Mahler's Bach orchestrations raise eyebrows, and earnest
completions of scores by Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert and Mahler
have generated reams of critical debate (or, in some cases, yawns
of indifference).
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Goehr's recomposition of Monteverdi's lost opera
``Arianna,'' which is having its first American run at the Opera
Theater of St. Louis, sails through an interesting loophole.
Because only Ottavio Rinuccini's libretto survives, along with a
fragment of Monteverdi's music _ Arianna's heart-rending lament,
``Lasciatemi morire'' _ a reconstruction was out of the question.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Goehr retained the lament and built his own structure
around it. Strands of Monteverdian harmonic, melodic and ornamental
style, as well as references to his instrumental coloration, are
woven through a contemporary fabric of quirky rhythms, eerie and
exotic percussion textures, brash, expressive dissonance and vocal
lines that combine declamation and gorgeously arching melody.
</P>
<P>
   There are precedents: Lukas Foss' 1967 ``Baroque Variations''
and Luciano Berio's 1990 ``Rendering'' work along similar lines.
``Arianna'' shares with the Foss work the sense of being a modern
composer's fantasy of writing Baroque music, as well as a
tongue-in-cheek skewering of Baroque conventions. Tim Ocel's
staging, seen at the Loretto-Hilton Center at Webster University
here on Friday, makes this skewering the central element.
</P>
<P>
   In Rinuccini's libretto, a weak-willed Teseo vows to make
Arianna his queen, then abandons her on Naxos. She is disconsolate,
but Venus and Cupid have conspired to send Bacchus to Naxos, where
he falls in love with Arianna and marries her. In Ocel's staging,
this finale is too much for Arianna, whose lament for Teseo was
presented only moments earlier as a wrenching mad scene. She walks
through her courtship and wedding with glazed eyes and a skeptical
look. Goehr set the text in Italian; it is being presented here in
a deftly poetic English translation by Margaret B. Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   Ocel, abetted by Leslie M. Taylor's spare set and Robin
VerHage-Abrams' polyglot costuming, parodies this tale of gods and
mortals in a brilliant parade of modern stereotypes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the gods, a punkish Cupid wears red leather, reads a
supermarket tabloid and carries a switchblade instead of a bow and
arrow. Venus is a tipsy, aging bleached-blond courtesan and Jove is
a doddering antique. Bacchus, looking like a paunchy Kurt Cobain,
has a retinue of Blues Brothers imitators.
</P>
<P>
   Among the mortals, Teseo and his soldiers wear American Army
uniforms, and Teseo's Councilor, who persuades him to leave
Arianna, is a slick lawyer with tortoise-shell glasses and a
leather briefcase. Arianna is dressed in a bridal gown; her
confidante, Dorilla, is a frumpy 1950s housewife. Except for their
odd masks, the fishermen _ who convey a lot of the information in
Rinuccini's talky libretto _ are presented straightforwardly.
</P>
<P>
   Executing Ocel's notions and Goehr's music while keeping the
ghosts of Monteverdi and Rinuccini in listeners' minds is a lot to
ask, but the singers were clearly game.
</P>
<P>
   Phyllis Pancella's Arianna hit the emotional extremes perfectly:
her powerful, beautifully sung account of the lament was the
production's most gripping moment, and her sudden acceptance of her
improved situation in the work's final seconds gave the piece a
surprising, comic twist. Marcel Reijans, once he got a wayward
vibrato under control, gave a solid account of Teseo's conflicted
music. James Wood was the suitably shadowy Councilor, and Mark
Crayton, a fine countertenor, was an amusingly dissolute Bacchus.
There were also strong contributions by Dorothy Byrne, as Venus and
Dorilla, Janice Creswell, as Cupid, and Kevin Short, Jeffrey Picon
and Thomas Trotter in smaller roles.
</P>
<P>
   A small instrumental ensemble drawn from the St. Louis Symphony
and conducted by Grant Llewellyn, moved between Monteverdi's style
and Goehr's music with admirable agility. The production runs
through Thursday.

 &HT;    Later, Prince Charming: Disney heroines set sights on more than
men
 &HT;    By Steve Murray and Eleanor Ringel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In the beginning, back in 1937, there was Snow White,
with her squeaky-clean image and her squeaky-clean dream that
someday her prince would come. Never mind that she spends most of
the movie co-habitating with seven vertically challenged men.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in 1950 came Cinderella, another nice girl with a Prince
Charming fetish. And at the end of the decade, in 1959, Sleeping
Beauty, who slept her way into her prince's arms. And let's not
forget Lady, whose sexual attraction for the rakishly declasse
Tramp is dissected in great detail in Whit Stillman's latest flick,
``The Last Days of Disco.''
</P>
<P>
   Beauties all. Not necessarily brainless beauties, either. But
what did any of them really want out of life besides the right to
live happily ever after with the right guy?
</P>
<P>
   Things changed for females in the late '60s and '70s, but in the
wonderful world of Disney, change didn't come so quickly. Aside
from Miss Bianca in ``The Rescuers,'' female leading characters
were virtually banished from Disney animated features. Then, in
1989, along came ``The Little Mermaid'' and a plucky dish out of
water named Ariel. Nine years later, ``Mulan'' (which opened at No.
2 at the box office this weekend) has taken the Magic Kingdom into
a new era of Girl Power.
</P>
<P>
   Ariel
</P>
<P>
   Her movie: ``The Little Mermaid'' (1989)
</P>
<P>
   Her look: Partly fishy lass with big red hair and clam shell
push-up bra.
</P>
<P>
   Her personality: Yearning to explore the airy other world above
the ocean, even if she risks her life.
</P>
<P>
   Significant other: Prince Eric, a mopey, bland bit of royalty.
</P>
<P>
   Moral of the story: Someday you'll find your prince, but only if
you go for a makeover, like losing your tail and gills.
</P>
<P>
   Snow White, eat my dust: Doesn't sweep floors, disobeys dad and
she finds and saves her prince, not the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   Belle
</P>
<P>
   Her movie: ``Beauty and the Beast'' (1991)
</P>
<P>
   Her look: Proper French bourgeois who actually takes time
twisting her hair into a 'do, unlike these hang-loose other
heroines.
</P>
<P>
   Her personality: Yearning to be left alone by handsome, mean
Gaston, so she can read her books in peace; smart but kind.
</P>
<P>
   Significant other: The Beast, a prince transformed for
selfishness.
</P>
<P>
   Moral of the story: Sometimes a big tough guy really needs love,
because at heart he's just Robby Benson talking in a deep voice.
</P>
<P>
   Snow White, eat my dust: A dark forest wouldn't freak her out
the way it does Miss White; plus, she falls in love with the Beast
because of his soul, not his looks or lineage.
</P>
<P>
   Her movie: ``Pocahontas'' (1995)
</P>
<P>
   Her look: The original Native American Breck Girl, partial to
smartly tailored buckskin frocks.
</P>
<P>
   Her personality: Go-getting, nature-loving, maize-growing,
pro-integration gal.
</P>
<P>
   Significant other: John Smith
</P>
<P>
   Moral of the story: Honor your heritage but welcome other
cultural traditions. And never trust a blond, 'cause he'll only
break your heart.
</P>
<P>
   Snow White, eat my dust: She's more interested in what's right
for her people and her land than in landing a boyfriend; in a
Disney first, she doesn't get the guy.
</P>
<P>
   Her movie: ``Mulan'' (1998)
</P>
<P>
   Her look: Tomboyish as a bride in training, but brawny as a
soldier (thanks to padded armor and a haircut).
</P>
<P>
   Her personality: Yearning to save her family's honor _ and her
father's life _ by proving herself a worthy fighter.
</P>
<P>
   Significant other: Shang, the hunky young commander of her
military unit.
</P>
<P>
   Moral of the story: Sometimes you have to break rules to do what
you know is right.
</P>
<P>
   Snow White, eat my dust: Can you see Snow in armor, shooting a
cannon and kicking Hun butt? No, I don't think so.

 &HT;    Grab yourself a seat on `Dr. Katz's' couch
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Comedy Central's ``South Park'' gets its laughs and acclaim
being rude and crude. ``Dr. Katz: Professional Therapist,'' its
less-hyped animated counterpart, gets its grins being dry and
droll. Really dry and droll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can we synchronize our watches?'' the balding, edgeless,
mildly mild Dr. Jonathan Katz (voiced by the comic of the same
name) asks his layabout, live-at-home son, Ben, over the phone,
trying to set up an important call for later in the morning. ``I
have exactly 8:24.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no watch,'' Ben answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that case,'' says Dr. Katz, not missing a beat, ``I'm going
to take off my watch. We're going to synchronize our wrists.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you had to be there. But ``Dr. Katz'' is back at 10
tonight for its fifth season, squiggly and wry as ever. Dr. Katz
is, of course, a divorced New York therapist, a kind of thinking
man's Homer Simpson, for whom dysfunction is normal. Each week real
comics, in animated form (or ``squiggle vision,'' as the vibrating
line drawings are known), take a seat on Dr. Katz's office couch
and unload their problems.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's main attraction is chain-smoking Denis Leary.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I was brought up, two men sitting in a room discussing
things is ... interrogation,'' he tells Dr. Katz. ``I'm Irish, so
we have our own way of dealing with feelings. Basically, keep it
bottled up until you explode.''
</P>
<P>
   It's only a matter of time before ``Dr. Katz'' reaches college
cult status, like ``South Park.'' Just wait until Kenny, Stan, Kyle
and Cartman are old enough to need therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Comedy Central introduces another animated series, ``Bob and
Margaret,'' at 10:30, after ``Dr. Katz.'' It's a British import
based on the 1995 Oscar-winning short film, ``Bob's Birthday,'' and
revolves around the eccentricities of dentist Bob and podiatrist
wife Margaret.
</P>
<P>
   It's clever and sneakily nasty in an unrelenting,
don't-laugh-out-loud way (``Britain can be the best place in the
world, bad teeth-wise''). It's hard not to be impressed. It's also
hard to like this prickly, self-absorbed couple enough to want to
watch them every week.
</P>
<P>
   But like many of our favorite cartoon misanthropes (have we
already mentioned ``South Park''?), we're willing to accept that
``Bob and Margaret'' is an acquired taste _ one we may yet acquire.
</P>
<P>
   Grades: ``Dr. Katz'' A-; ``Bob and Margaret'' B
</P>
<P>
   QUICK HITS
</P>
<P>
   ABC has begun production on an American version of ``Whose Line
Is It Anyway?'' that will air later this summer. It's a takeoff on
the popular British series with comic actors performing unrehearsed
skits. Drew Carey will host. ... Tennis buffs can see early-round
Wimbledon matches at 9 a.m. each weekday this week on HBO.

 &HT;    No rubber gloves, promises new talk show host Mandel
 &HT;    By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The interview with Howie Mandel was going great.
</P>
<P>
   He's been doing media ``phoners'' from Los Angeles to promote
the debut of his self-titled daytime talk show, and he's chatting a
mile a minute about the guests, the band, and how he's working in
the same studio that his idol, Johnny Carson, used for ``The
Tonight Show'' _ the same studio where Mandel got his big TV break
in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Then the rubber glove question comes up and there's a pause _ a
long, uncomfortable silence that feels like all the oxygen is being
sucked out of the room Mandel's in even though he's 2,000 miles
away.
</P>
<P>
   Back when Mandel was known as a geek-a-zoid stand-up comic, he'd
put a rubber glove on his head, blow real hard and inflate it like
a balloon. Big laughs then. Not so funny now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't put a glove on my head in 12 years,'' Mandel says
with the don't-mess-with-me resolve of someone who has completed a
12-step recovery program. ``But people are welcome to do that in
the privacy of their own homes if they want.''
</P>
<P>
   A joke. That's a good sign. But don't be fooled. This guy
doesn't sound like the wacky Mandel who played the Afro'd Dr. Wayne
Fiscus on TV's old medical drama ``St. Elsewhere'' or the cuddly
inner-child Mandel who created, and starred in two Saturday morning
kiddie shows: ``Bobby's World'' and ``The Amazing Live Sea
Monkeys.''
</P>
<P>
   No, this is Howard Mandel, the all-grown-up syndicated talk show
host.
</P>
<P>
   ``This show is giving me an opportunity to be me,'' Mandel says,
perking up again. ``I've been married 20 years and I'll talk about
what's going on in my house and in my life and with my kids. I'm
not doing gags. The stories I'll be talking about will be organic,
not produced or fake.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandel says the show will feature ``host chat'' with his studio
audience, pre-taped comedy bits, man- (or woman-) on-the-street
segments, variety acts and, of course, the requisite celebrity
guests. Today's lineup is Jennifer Aniston, Arsenio Hall and Usher.
Ted Danson, Chris Rock, Lionel Richie, Clint Black, Tyra Banks and
Paul Reiser have also been booked for the first week.
</P>
<P>
   The show's musical director is Steve Goldstein, who has scored
several films, including ``The Birdcage'' and ``Primary Colors.''
The seven-piece band also has two members of the R&AMP;B group Tower of
Power. Actress Brianne Leary was slated to be Mandel's on-camera
sidekick, but she didn't click with test audiences and has been
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Mandel says he got hooked on the idea of hosting while filling
in on ``Live With Regis &AMP; Kathie Lee,'' the ratings-successful
boy-girl daytime tandem. Mandel says he was also inspired by
Carson, Merv Griffin, Mike Douglas, Dinah Shore and Jack Paar _ the
golden age talkers whose style and success he hopes to emulate.
</P>
<P>
   But the talk show circuit has become a graveyard of good
intentions (remember Carnie Wilson? Tempestt Bledsoe? Danny
Bonaduce?), and only a handful of hosts have done it very well or
very long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody sets out to make a bad show,'' Mandel
says. ``This format was originated by Jack Paar, and it works
because of the person sitting behind the desk. That's why we watch
(Jay) Leno and (David) Letterman.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandel has a built-in following from his days as stand-up comic
and actor, but the big question remains: Can a former rubber
glovehead ever be taken seriously as a daytime talk show host?
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of what you've done before, when you're spending an
hour in someone's home every day, they will decide very quickly
whether they want to be with you or someone else,'' Mandel says.
``I don't care if I'm No. 1 in my time slot or if I win an Emmy.''

 &HT;    Braves finish series with Expos, move on to NY
 &HT;    By Jack Wilkinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Despite their denials, surely they want to be a part
of it: New York, New York, then Atlanta, Atlanta. How else to
explain how listless the Braves were for most of the weekend?
Surely, they overlooked the Expos in anticipation of tonight's
Yankee biggie in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, facing a reclamation project named Shawn Boskie,
Atlanta was humbled 14-1, its worst loss in four years. On Sunday,
after the encouraging Saturday night return of John Smoltz, the
Braves stumbled against another right-hander with no prior success
against Atlanta. Dustin Hermanson allowed just five hits in eight
innings and, save for Michael Tucker's solo homer, frustrated
Atlanta in Montreal's 4-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   That denied the Braves a 15th straight series win over Montreal,
which hadn't taken a series from Atlanta since 1994. It also gave
Expos manager Felipe Alou his 500th career victory, who savored it
even more coming against Bobby Cox.
</P>
<P>
   ''What makes me happy is it was against a man I really respect,
who has never been given the credit he deserves,'' Alou said.
''It's not his fault he has a great team.''
</P>
<P>
   Not this weekend. ''Hermanson looked good,'' Cox said of a guy
who never started until last season, was 0-2 lifetime against the
Braves with a 5.40 ERA and was making his fourth start since coming
off the disabled list. Denny Neagle? He looked like he has for the
last month: Beset by bad luck, undone by one bad inning.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is how it's been going for me,'' Neagle said after losing
for the fourth time in five starts and dropping to 8-5. ''With the
exception of the Boston game, every game I've lost, with a break
here or there, I could've won. These games are frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Neagle's now lost as many games as he did all last season when,
at 20-5, he was the NL's lone 20-game winner. The sixth-inning,
leadoff homer by Shane Andrews was the 16th surrendered by Neagle
(seventh in his last four starts), just two fewer than he allowed
last year.
</P>
<P>
   But the third inning was decisive, when the Expos batted around
and scored three times. This after Neagle had retired the first
nine batters in order.
</P>
<P>
   ''He threw three perfect innings,'' Javy Lopez said. ''After
that, he started missing some pitches in the middle of the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was a pitch out of the strike zone that hurt Neagle
badly. F.P. Santangelo was the first Expo to reach when Neagle hit
him to start the fourth. Santangelo advanced on a sacrifice bunt,
then scored on Ozzie Guillen's error. After Rondell White's double
(''I threw it without any conviction and left it up,'' Neagle
said), Andrews was walked intentionally to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   Neagle got ahead of Mark Grudzielanek 1-2, then threw a good
changeup down-and-away that Grudzielanek chased and slapped for a
two-run single. ''That's what's frustrating,'' Neagle said.
''Sometimes it happens that way. You make good pitches and it ends
up that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez thought the good pitch could've been even better. ''On
1-2, you've still got three pitches to walk him,'' he said. ''In
that situation, the perfect pitch is you throw it in the dirt.''
</P>
<P>
   No way. Not this weekend. ''A series is a series,'' said Cox.
''I'm going to go to New York.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   What with baby-boomers of the female persuasion wringing their
hands, furrowing their brows and working themselves up into
frenzies over the passing years and the ebb of hormones, thank
goodness  &UR; Cybill Shepherd &LR;  is offering advice.
</P>
<P>
   The venue, of course, is People magazine. The subject is
menopause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had quite intense hot flashes for about three months,''
writes the 48-year-old actress in a searing first-person account.
``So far this year they seem to have subsided. The people I worked
with were very helpful. ... They'd get me ice water.''
</P>
<P>
   But even women who don't have water carriers can survive. ``My
advice for women entering menopause,'' writes Shepherd, ``is to
trust your feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; KISSING MINNIE DRIVER &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  A profile of  &UR; Minnie Driver &LR; , the sexy British actress whose
on-screen romance with  &UR; Matt Damon &LR;  in ``Good Will Hunting'' led to
an off-screen affair and then a very public breakup, is profiled in
the latest issue of Elle magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Driver's co-star in ``The Governess,'' a movie set to open later
this month, is  &UR; Tom Wilkinson &LR; , 50, who plays the father of her
ward, and also her secret lover. ``In amateur theatricals,'' he
told Elle, ``the Romeo and Juliet always have affairs. And it's a
tendency of the young to plunge everything into their work.'' Most
experienced actors have learned to express emotion without
experiencing it, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kissing is tremendously erotic. I've never kissed somebody and
gone away without a lingering, `What if? ...' I'm sort of used to
it, but for younger people, it's still exciting and surprising that
it's okay to kiss the beautiful stranger.''
</P>
<P>
   As to Driver, ``I hate watching her get chewed up by these
relationships. I saw something in a gossip column about her kissing
some guy at a party, and I thought, Minnie, go home, make some
Ovaltine and go to bed.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - In downtown San Francisco on Wednesday,  &UR; Fran Johns &LR;  saw a
``huge red and white truck complete with upended bed and a
prominent sign on the back'' that read ``International Garbage
Only.'' Now what was  &LR; that &LR;  all about?
</P>
<P>
   - More Beatles animal rights songs, as per  &UR; Johnny &LR; 
 &UR; Miller &LR; : ``Martha My Deer''; ``Penny Loon,'' ``Snake Rattle and
Roll'' and ``The Long and Winding Roe.''
</P>
<P>
   - Personals walks the plank:  &UR; Dennis Conner &LR;  has nothing to do
with America True, the America's Cup vessel being built at Pier 17;
 &UR; Dawn Riley &LR;  is captain and CEO. The fund-raiser is private, by
invitation only.
</P>
<P>
   - Ambling down Irving Street in San Francisco,  &UR; Tim Robinson &LR; 
overheard one pedestrian say to another, ``When we're taking a
shower together, smell is the last sense that comes to mind.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Tom Abate &LR;  attended a National Writers' Workshop a few months
ago that included an appearance by  &UR; Patricia Smith &LR; , the Boston
Globe columnist who lost her job last week after she admitted
fabricating quotes and characters. ``Take risks,'' said a brochure
description of Smith's philosophy. ``Create a new set of rules for
yourself. ... If you believe there is no room for real creativity
in journalism, then amshay on ooyay.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Samuel Berger &LR; , assistant to the president for national
security affairs, writes in the World Affairs Council newsletter
that the U.S. debt to the U.N. could be paid off for about $4 a
year per American, ``about the price of a Happy Meal at
McDonald's.''  &UR; David Fischer &LR; , former president of the council,
suggests an additional incentive: ``Maybe if they throw in a Beanie
Baby, we could get them to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``How did Hillary miss Monica? What was she thinking? Why &LR; 
 &UR; didn't she insist on only male interns? In my White House, all &LR; 
 &UR; interns would look like James Carville. This approach has worked &LR; 
 &UR; well for the Royal Family.'' &LR;

   CLINTON-STARR (Washington) _ Five months after investigators
began exploring allegations of a relationship between Clinton and
Monica Lewinsky, the former White House intern's new lawyers appear
to have returned to the same standoff with Kenneth Starr, the
independent counsel, that her previous lawyers confronted. Details
of the negotiations between Starr and Ms. Lewinsky's legal team,
which appeared Sunday in the Washington Post and were confirmed by
people with knowledge of the investigation, suggest that the two
sides are still far from an agreement that would lead to her
testimony.

 &HT;    Behind the tv image of Clinton's China trip are months of
planning, headaches
 &HT;    EDS: Adds additional details throughout
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Red paper lanterns, gongs, drums and a cast of
hundreds decked out as Tang Dynasty warriors will await President
Clinton this Thursday when he arrives at the ancient Silk Road city
of Xian to kick off a nine-day tour of China.
</P>
<P>
   The imperial-style welcome will wind up a much longer journey,
however, for legions of U.S. officials who have been toiling since
last winter to choreograph and coordinate every imaginable detail
of a state visit that will take the president through 3,500 years
of Chinese history and leave him peering far into the nation's
future.
</P>
<P>
   For behind the scenes at each leg of Clinton's five-city tour
lie countless strategy meetings, site inspections, event
consultations and back-room skull sessions. It's all the work of a
temporal team of White House schedulers, diplomats, security
agents, communications experts, transportation specialists,
physicians and even chefs who have come together in recent months
to plan the presidential trip to China.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to factor in time on the president's schedule,
security, press access, the message and what you want to highlight,
the logistics of the cars'' and similar concerns for each separate
event, explained a White House official who has worked closely on
the upcoming China trip. ``Then you have to feed it all into a meat
grinder.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, for instance, eye-popping logistical matters to be
worked out, starting with the basic question of just how should the
Leader of the Free World travel, and how long must he be away from
the office?
</P>
<P>
   Answer to both: take your own jumbo jet and bring the office
along in the form of Air Force One, the president's personal magic
carpet. It's a specially modified Boeing 747-200 that, for $35,300
an hour _ not including the crew of 26 _ can move the essential
functions of the White House from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue to
virtually anywhere else on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   In case it breaks down, a second, similar plane will shadow Air
Force One on the trip as a standby.
</P>
<P>
   In the event the president hits a rough patch, he'll have his
own physician with him, as well as a complete emergency room's
worth of medical gear and supplies. And as a precaution, bottled
water is being flown for the president and First Lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton to drink and bathe.
</P>
<P>
   The president will take along his own car, too _ an armored
black limousine that flies ahead in its own Air Force cargo jet.
Nine other armored limos will also be flown ahead to transport
various high-ranking officials accompanying the president.
</P>
<P>
   Also flying ahead will be a pair of sport utility vehicles used
by the U.S. Secret Service agents who protect the president.
</P>
<P>
   He will also take his own private telephone company _ banks of
switching and transmission gear must be transported and set up days
ahead of time for each stop he'll make _ so that the president can
talk with international leaders or key U.S. officials anywhere
around the world without worrying that someone else might be
listening. All told, it's estimated the White House will be taking
60 tons of communications gear.
</P>
<P>
   Good help can be hard to find overseas, so the president will
also take along enough personnel to staff a good-sized
corporation.The president will have his personal valet, for
instance, and Mrs. Clinton will bring her personal hairdresser.
</P>
<P>
   The ``official party'' accompany Clinton will number more than
100. In addition to a horde of presidential assistants, Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright, Secretary of Treasury Robert Rubin and
National Security Adviser Samuel Berger will bring key members of
their staffs.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of other administration officials with expertise in
everything from trade and environmental matters to arms control and
international law will also be along on the trip, many of them
traveling separately aboard smaller Air Force transport craft.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't yet clear precisely how large the presidential
entourage to China will be, but some 800 people went along with
Clinton to Africa last spring, in addition to 200 journalists and
media technicians.
</P>
<P>
   The China entourage is expected to be somewhat smaller _ though
the press contingent will be twice as large as it was in Africa _
largely because many of the American corporations that sent
executives on the Africa trip have representative offices in China.
The cost for members of the media accompanying the president is
expected to be about $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Secret Service protection is, of course, secret, though agents
sometimes take very public steps aimed at deterring would-be
assailants by showing the presence of a large and comprehensive
security effort.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton visited the crime-ridden city of Cape
Town in South Africa last March, for instance, local security
agents, working hand-in-glove with the U.S. Secret Service,
canvassed the city and welded shut manhole covers along possible
routes of the presidential motorcade, closing off a possible avenue
of attack and also sending out the message that a tight security
net had been cast across the seaside city.
</P>
<P>
   Secret Service agents typically inspect the sites of
presidential visits weeks in advance, often using a video camera to
record every place and path on the presidential journey. Then they
scrutinize the tape to make sure that every building air duct, door
or hallway has been secured against possible assassins or bombers.
They also bring along their own bomb-sniffing dogs, metal detectors
and even the president's bulletproof lectern, which is known as the
``blue goose.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, a presidential trip is global theater, scripted,
directed and managed to convey American priorities, as identified
by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hopes to use the China trip, for instance, to try to
redefine American impressions and to show that his policy of
engaging with China economically, politically and diplomatically,
is helping to foster change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that as a result of the trip, the American people will
learn more about China,'' Clinton said Friday. China is changing,
he said, but ``if you never get any kind of constructive
information, it's hard to know.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, one of the first things Clinton plans to do
in China is to visit a small village named Xia He, characteristic
of hundreds of thousands of rural hamlets across the vast country
that are struggling to shift away from the old ways of a state-run
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Largely by shifting to market-based economic practices, in
concert with opening up to foreign investment, tourism and trade,
China has seen perhaps half a billion of its people rise from the
depths of hardscrabble poverty over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   By stitching together brilliant Tang-dynasty era caps of
imperial yellow or red for sale to tourists who flock to the Terra
-cotta Warriors Museum nearby, Xia He resident He Jong Jie now
takes in the local equivalent of about $120 a month, many times
more than she used to earn in what she calls ''that smelly
farming'' that once provided sustenance for her and her family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their lives have changed for the better,'' said a White House
official who's done much of the advance work for Clinton's trip.
``Obviously that's something that we're going to want to highlight,
as will the Chinese government.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also hopes to underscore China's long history of unity
and achievement, while, at the same time, spotlighting its vast
potential for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Those themes will underpin his planned visit to the Great Wall,
built 2200 years ago to keep out invaders from the north.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the world is open. Every country is open to each other and
the world is like one large community. It's hard to imagine that a
certain country would build a wall to isolate itself from the rest
of the world,'' explained a senior Chinese official. ``The lesson
of the last one and a half centuries is that China totally closed
itself against the introduction of new ideas from outsiders. That's
why Deng Xiaoping (who died last year after leading China for two
decades) introduced the opening to the outside world in 1978.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the dozens of sites he plans to visit _ the terra-cotta
warriors near Xian, the Forbidden City in Beijing, the stock
exchange in Shanghai _ there are dozens more his advance team
considered, surveyed and later rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Some presented security nightmares, others involved too much
time or simply didn't fit the story line.
</P>
<P>
   Despite months of planning, it's impossible to fully control a
nine-day tour through the world's most populous country. The best
laid plans, indeed, can go awry.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton opened his Africa tour in March with a stop in
Ghana, for instance, a crowd estimated at some quarter of a million
people turned out to listen to him speak. At one point, the crowd
surged forward, dangerously pinning two women against a fence. Film
footage of Clinton's panic-stricken cries for people to move back
dominated television coverage of the day's events, to the
consternation of White House spin doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, moreover, can't control everything about a
presidential trip.
</P>
<P>
   It is the Chinese authorities, the White House claims, who have
insisted that Clinton be received by President Jiang Zemin in front
of the Great Hall of the People, which borders Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures of Clinton reviewing troops of the People's Liberation
Army beside the seat of a democracy movement the PLA brutally
crushed in 1989 is hardly the sort of image the White House message
shop might dream up. The timing of the event, however - 10 p.m.
Friday Eastern time - has the earmarks of an attentive advance
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to beat up on us for going (to Tiananmen
Square),'' said one White House official, ``at least give us credit
for doing it in the middle of the night.''

 &HT;    Behind the tv image of Clinton's China trip are months of
planning, headaches
 &HT;    EDS: Adds additional details throughout

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Red paper lanterns, gongs, drums and a cast of
hundreds decked out as Tang Dynasty warriors will await President
Clinton this Thursday when he arrives at the ancient Silk Road city
of Xian to kick off a nine-day tour of China.
</P>
<P>
   The imperial-style welcome will wind up a much longer journey,
however, for legions of U.S. officials who have been toiling since
last winter to choreograph and coordinate every imaginable detail
of a state visit that will take the president through 3,500 years
of Chinese history and leave him peering far into the nation's
future.
</P>
<P>
   For behind the scenes at each leg of Clinton's five-city tour
lie countless strategy meetings, site inspections, event
consultations and back-room skull sessions. It's all the work of a
temporal team of White House schedulers, diplomats, security
agents, communications experts, transportation specialists,
physicians and even chefs who have come together in recent months
to plan the presidential trip to China.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to factor in time on the president's schedule,
security, press access, the message and what you want to highlight,
the logistics of the cars'' and similar concerns for each separate
event, explained a White House official who has worked closely on
the upcoming China trip. ``Then you have to feed it all into a meat
grinder.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, for instance, eye-popping logistical matters to be
worked out, starting with the basic question of just how should the
Leader of the Free World travel, and how long must he be away from
the office?
</P>
<P>
   Answer to both: take your own jumbo jet and bring the office
along in the form of Air Force One, the president's personal magic
carpet. It's a specially modified Boeing 747-200 that, for $35,300
an hour _ not including the crew of 26 _ can move the essential
functions of the White House from 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue to
virtually anywhere else on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   In case it breaks down, a second, similar plane will shadow Air
Force One on the trip as a standby.
</P>
<P>
   In the event the president hits a rough patch, he'll have his
own physician with him, as well as a complete emergency room's
worth of medical gear and supplies. And as a precaution, bottled
water is being flown for the president and First Lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton to drink and bathe.
</P>
<P>
   The president will take along his own car, too _ an armored
black limousine that flies ahead in its own Air Force cargo jet.
Nine other armored limos will also be flown ahead to transport
various high-ranking officials accompanying the president.
</P>
<P>
   Also flying ahead will be a pair of sport utility vehicles used
by the U.S. Secret Service agents who protect the president.
</P>
<P>
   He will also take his own private telephone company _ banks of
switching and transmission gear must be transported and set up days
ahead of time for each stop he'll make _ so that the president can
talk with international leaders or key U.S. officials anywhere
around the world without worrying that someone else might be
listening. All told, it's estimated the White House will be taking
60 tons of communications gear.
</P>
<P>
   Good help can be hard to find overseas, so the president will
also take along enough personnel to staff a good-sized
corporation.The president will have his personal valet, for
instance, and Mrs. Clinton will bring her personal hairdresser.
</P>
<P>
   The ``official party'' accompany Clinton will number more than
100. In addition to a horde of presidential assistants, Secretary
of State Madeleine Albright, Secretary of Treasury Robert Rubin and
National Security Adviser Samuel Berger will bring key members of
their staffs.
</P>
<P>
   Scores of other administration officials with expertise in
everything from trade and environmental matters to arms control and
international law will also be along on the trip, many of them
traveling separately aboard smaller Air Force transport craft.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't yet clear precisely how large the presidential
entourage to China will be, but some 800 people went along with
Clinton to Africa last spring, in addition to 200 journalists and
media technicians.
</P>
<P>
   The China entourage is expected to be somewhat smaller _ though
the press contingent will be twice as large as it was in Africa _
largely because many of the American corporations that sent
executives on the Africa trip have representative offices in China.
The cost for members of the media accompanying the president is
expected to be about $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Secret Service protection is, of course, secret, though agents
sometimes take very public steps aimed at deterring would-be
assailants by showing the presence of a large and comprehensive
security effort.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton visited the crime-ridden city of Cape
Town in South Africa last March, for instance, local security
agents, working hand-in-glove with the U.S. Secret Service,
canvassed the city and welded shut manhole covers along possible
routes of the presidential motorcade, closing off a possible avenue
of attack and also sending out the message that a tight security
net had been cast across the seaside city.
</P>
<P>
   Secret Service agents typically inspect the sites of
presidential visits weeks in advance, often using a video camera to
record every place and path on the presidential journey. Then they
scrutinize the tape to make sure that every building air duct, door
or hallway has been secured against possible assassins or bombers.
They also bring along their own bomb-sniffing dogs, metal detectors
and even the president's bulletproof lectern, which is known as the
``blue goose.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, a presidential trip is global theater, scripted,
directed and managed to convey American priorities, as identified
by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hopes to use the China trip, for instance, to try to
redefine American impressions and to show that his policy of
engaging with China economically, politically and diplomatically,
is helping to foster change.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that as a result of the trip, the American people will
learn more about China,'' Clinton said Friday. China is changing,
he said, but ``if you never get any kind of constructive
information, it's hard to know.''
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, one of the first things Clinton plans to do
in China is to visit a small village named Xia He, characteristic
of hundreds of thousands of rural hamlets across the vast country
that are struggling to shift away from the old ways of a state-run
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Largely by shifting to market-based economic practices, in
concert with opening up to foreign investment, tourism and trade,
China has seen perhaps half a billion of its people rise from the
depths of hardscrabble poverty over the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
   By stitching together brilliant Tang-dynasty era caps of
imperial yellow or red for sale to tourists who flock to the Terra
-cotta Warriors Museum nearby, Xia He resident He Jong Jie now
takes in the local equivalent of about $120 a month, many times
more than she used to earn in what she calls ''that smelly
farming'' that once provided sustenance for her and her family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their lives have changed for the better,'' said a White House
official who's done much of the advance work for Clinton's trip.
``Obviously that's something that we're going to want to highlight,
as will the Chinese government.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also hopes to underscore China's long history of unity
and achievement, while, at the same time, spotlighting its vast
potential for the future.
</P>
<P>
   Those themes will underpin his planned visit to the Great Wall,
built 2200 years ago to keep out invaders from the north.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the world is open. Every country is open to each other and
the world is like one large community. It's hard to imagine that a
certain country would build a wall to isolate itself from the rest
of the world,'' explained a senior Chinese official. ``The lesson
of the last one and a half centuries is that China totally closed
itself against the introduction of new ideas from outsiders. That's
why Deng Xiaoping (who died last year after leading China for two
decades) introduced the opening to the outside world in 1978.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the dozens of sites he plans to visit _ the terra-cotta
warriors near Xian, the Forbidden City in Beijing, the stock
exchange in Shanghai _ there are dozens more his advance team
considered, surveyed and later rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Some presented security nightmares, others involved too much
time or simply didn't fit the story line.
</P>
<P>
   Despite months of planning, it's impossible to fully control a
nine-day tour through the world's most populous country. The best
laid plans, indeed, can go awry.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton opened his Africa tour in March with a stop in
Ghana, for instance, a crowd estimated at some quarter of a million
people turned out to listen to him speak. At one point, the crowd
surged forward, dangerously pinning two women against a fence. Film
footage of Clinton's panic-stricken cries for people to move back
dominated television coverage of the day's events, to the
consternation of White House spin doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, moreover, can't control everything about a
presidential trip.
</P>
<P>
   It is the Chinese authorities, the White House claims, who have
insisted that Clinton be received by President Jiang Zemin in front
of the Great Hall of the People, which borders Tiananmen Square.
</P>
<P>
   Pictures of Clinton reviewing troops of the People's Liberation
Army beside the seat of a democracy movement the PLA brutally
crushed in 1989 is hardly the sort of image the White House message
shop might dream up. The timing of the event, however - 10 p.m.
Friday Eastern time - has the earmarks of an attentive advance
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to beat up on us for going (to Tiananmen
Square),'' said one White House official, ``at least give us credit
for doing it in the middle of the night.''

PLAN TO EXPAND JERUSALEM'S MUNICIPAL CONTROL IS APPROVED 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SERGE SCHMEMANN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The Israeli Cabinet approved a plan Sunday to expand
the city of Jerusalem's control far beyond its current borders,
despite angry protests from Palestinians and Washington's warning
that the plan was ``provocative.''
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said at a news conference
after the unanimous decision that the plan had no political
ramifications and was not a violation of the Israeli-Palestinian
peace accords, under which the final status of Jerusalem is to be
negotiated with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a general presumption among Israelis and
Palestinians that the real goals were to strengthen Israel's hold
on what it has proclaimed as its ``united and eternal capital,'' to
bolster its links to eastern settlements, and to expand its Jewish
population and tax base by annexing wealthier and more secular
towns in Israel to the west.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, who have proclaimed their goal to be a
Palestinian state with Jerusalem as its capital, issued a chorus of
denunciations. ``This is a declaration of war on the Palestinian
presence in Jerusalem,'' declared Saeb Erekat, a Palestinian
official.
</P>
<P>
   The plan adopted by the Cabinet, referred to as ``the plan for
strengthening of Jerusalem's status,'' set out guidelines under
which Jerusalem would expand the area under its control by roughly
a half. This would be done in part by annexing several Israeli
towns in the ``Jerusalem corridor'' to the west, and in part by
bringing several Jewish communities and settlements on lands
conquered in 1967 to the east and north under an ``umbrella
municipality,'' with Jerusalem responsible for planning,
construction, budget matters and services.
</P>
<P>
   All this, Netanyahu said, was within Israel's right, and ``an
internal Israeli matter, not a matter requiring a diplomatic
report.''
</P>
<P>
   But in Washington, Secretary of State Madeline Albright said on
the NBC News program ``Meet the Press'' that she called Netanyahu
after hearing of the action and made U.S. displeasure clear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him that it was being viewed as something that was not
helpful to the peace process, because in this very delicate
environment, unilateral actions are not the kind that are
helpful,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Friday, the day after the Israeli plan was first made public,
State Department spokesman James Rubin said, ``We believe it is
extremely hard to understand why Israel would even consider taking
such a provocative step at this sensitive time in the
negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright also held a conference call with American Jewish
leaders to voice displeasure with the scheme, and then talked to
Netanyahu by telephone Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu said Sunday that initial reaction to the plan was
``distorted and misinterpreted, in a tendentious way, in my
opinion.'' He said Washington's angry initial reaction was
evidently based on a misunderstanding, adding, ``I think their
whole response in this matter was surprising and superfluous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The criticism that there was some violation of agreements that
Israel has signed is ridiculous,'' he told Israeli Army Radio
earlier in the day. ``Israel's activities in Jerusalem are in
accordance with agreements and with the historic decree of the
Jewish people.''
</P>
<P>
   The loudest initial protest Sunday came not from Palestinians or
the United States, but from residents of the Israeli towns to be
annexed, especially Mevasseret Zion. Some of the residents of these
towns are people who moved out of Jerusalem to escape the spread of
its rigorously Orthodox neighborhoods, and who are dead-set against
coming under Jerusalem's control. They tried to block the
Jerusalem-Tel Aviv highway Sunday, eading to scuffles with police
in which eight people were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has been negotiating with Israel for many
months now on a further Israeli withdrawal in the West Bank that
would enable the long-stalled negotiations with Palestinians to
enter into a final phase. The future of Jerusalem is one of the
central issues to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   According to the newspaper Haaretz, the plan adopted Sunday was
based on a secret Cabinet resolution adopted in February 1997.
Sunday's decision set guidelines and created a committee of experts
to prepare concrete recommendations on the structure of the
``umbrella municipality,'' as well as the exact list of localities
to be annexed. The committee is to report back after the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Cabinet decision did not list specific areas, reports
in Israeli newspapers said that in areas that were captured from
Jordan in 1967, the authority of the ``umbrella municipality'' was
expected to reach several large and small Jewish neighborhoods,
including Maale Adumim to the east and Givat Zeev to the north, as
well as such smaller settlements as Givon and Adam.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement would enable Jerusalem to expand and strengthen
the settlements and to fortify their ties with Jerusalem, with new
roads and tunnels.
</P>
<P>
   In the west, the plan recommended that areas from Betar to Tsur
Hadassah to the southwest, and to Shoresh and Kiryat Yearim in the
Jerusalem corridor, be annexed outright. These areas would swell
Jerusalem's area by half, from 48 square miles to 72 square miles,
and would make room for 140,000 housing units with 1 million
residents.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also called for the construction of various roads,
including a beltway in East Jerusalem, and for the investment of
money into the creation of high-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the intense local opposition, there were reports that
Mevasseret Zion would not be annexed, but would be brought under
the ``umbrella municipality'' like the eastern regions. The effect
would be largely the same, giving powers over construction and
planning to Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   One major government concern addressed by the expansion plan was
the fact that Jerusalem has been losing secular and prosperous
middle-class residents in recent years because of the rapid growth
of the relatively poor strictly Orthodox population in the city.
Another government concern is that the Palestinian population in
Jerusalem has been growing at a greater rate than the Jewish
population. A 1995 census put the city's total population at
591,400, with 417,000 Jews and 174,400 Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli government planners acknowledged in the proposals that
one major goal was that ``the relative size of the Jewish and
non-Jewish populations in the city should be maintained.''
Specifically, the report said the target was to ensure that 70
percent of Jerusalem's population be Jews in 2020.
</P>
<P>
   At a press conference Sunday, Netanyahu and the mayor of
Jerusalem, Ehud Olmert, were relatively cautious in spelling out
the goals of the project.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister said it was intended to improve the lives of
all residents of Jerusalem, to ``unify specific municipal services
and make them more efficient,'' and in general to transform
Jerusalem ``into the capital of all citizens of Israel, the capital
of the Jewish people, and in my opinion, one of the leading cities
in the world in the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   But when Netanyahu first presented the project last Thursday, he
said: ``We said we would work to strengthen, fortify and base our
hold and sovereign in Jerusalem. I think this is a basic change in
Jerusalem's status which will be remembered as a turning point. The
first thing we are doing is to link greater Jerusalem. The second
thing is strengthening the Jewish majority in Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
   In the same tone, Netanyahu vowed that construction would soon
begin on Har Homa, the site of a proposed Jewish neighborhood in
southeastern Jerusalem whose announcement 16 months ago was
fiercely condemned by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ``Write it down,'' he said. ``You will see houses at Har Homa,
many houses, by the year 2000.''

ELWAY PARDONED FOR MISSING D.C. PARTY

<P>
   Super Bowl MVP John Elway skipped a trip to the White House last
week for a knee checkup (the MRI came up clean) and a tee time at
Inverness Golf Club in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``John's been to the White House before,'' Broncos coach Mike
Shanahan said. ``It's not like it's his first time.''
</P>
<P>
   Is that an excuse we can live with?
</P>
<P>
   Elway's secretary, Kathy Hatch, said the absence wasn't entirely
caused by a sore knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a bunch of stuff to do this week and he pretty much
decided that it was an overload to fit that White House visit in
because it wasn't required by the team,'' Hatch said. ``There are
only so many hours in the day.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, maybe it was politics.
</P>
<P>
   Elway is an ardent Republican who reportedly has considered
running for Congress.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Clinton handled the situation with presidential
grace.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're sorry he couldn't be here,'' said Clinton, who mentioned
Elway's achievements in his remarks to the media. ``We're glad he's
OK.... Maybe the most remarkable thing about winning the Super Bowl
was the loyalty of the community and the steadfastness of John
Elway.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheerio, MJ: Kellogg had planned to issue a Corn Flakes box
featuring the NBA champion Chicago Bulls on the front, but the NBA
said the company couldn't because Michael Jordan is a spokesman for
General Mills, which makes Wheaties.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA and Battle Creek, Mich.-based Kellogg said earlier this
month they had an agreement for Kellogg to be the NBA's
breakfast-food sponsor. They planned to issue a commemorative
cereal box with the championship winner.

<P>
   While inflation over all is at its lowest rate since the 1960s,
prices have been rising rather noticeably in recent months for a
variety of everyday items _ from fast-food hamburgers to auto
maintenance and dental care.
</P>
<P>
   The increases have been sharp enough not only to catch people's
attention but to provoke their annoyance.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the experience of John Gachelin, a 28-year-old
marketing executive, who moved with his wife to Dallas from
Chicago, in part to lower their living costs. Unlike Illinois,
Texas has no state income tax. And houses cost less. But in the
seven months since the move, the Gachelins have been hit with steep
price increases to rent videos, change the oil in their two cars,
buy cigarettes (he smokes), use a pay phone and buy hardcover
books.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pay phone really surprised me,'' said Gachelin, who earns
$40,000 a year. ``I put in a quarter one day, and I found that I
had to deposit 35 cents. But, hey, what can you do about it?''
</P>
<P>
   What softens the blow for the Gachelins and many others are the
prices that are not rising. Most of the essentials _ food,
gasoline, cars, furniture, appliances, everyday apparel _ are
holding steady in price or becoming cheaper. That is why the
Consumer Price Index, which is an average of the prices of
thousands of goods and services, has risen by only 1.7 percent over
the last year.
</P>
<P>
   It is the extras in life _ along with a few striking essentials,
like home prices and rents _ that are becoming noticeably more
expensive, and that rise is raising eyebrows. The University of
Michigan's weekly consumer surveys may be registering the smallest
percentage of Americans in 30 years worried about inflation, but
they are also registering a growing annoyance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost everyone has this asymmetric reaction,'' said Richard
Curtin, director of the surveys. ``When prices go down or don't
rise much, people don't say, `On average, inflation is 1 or 2
percent.' Their attention is drawn to the items that went up in
price, and they are annoyed. When prices go down or hold steady,
they don't pay special attention; they just think that was a good
buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how can the overall inflation rate remain so low while so
many individual prices seem to be rising smartly? The answer lies
in the way the Consumer Price Index is calculated. The government
checks 80,000 different prices each month, many of them for
manufactured goods and commodities _ toys and cars, for example,
and gasoline and food. These prices figure heavily in the averaging
process that produces the Consumer Price Index. But over the last
year, the prices of manufactured goods and commodities have
remained steady, in part because of the pressure of global
competition, and that has held down the overall index.
</P>
<P>
   The price increases these days are centered in the service
sector, where prices are rising rather smartly for a growing number
of items. These increases, however, are not widespread enough to
pull up the overall index beyond its current low level.
</P>
<P>
   ``The price increases in services have certainly outpaced those
for products and commodities in the Consumer Price Index,'' said
Patrick Jackman, chief of the group at the Bureau of Labor
Statistics that compiles the index. If the trend continues, the
index could edge up gradually. That, in fact, has happened in the
last two months.
</P>
<P>
   The expanding list of rising prices is partly a reflection of
the robust economy. As incomes rise and unemployment falls, people
become more ambitious in their purchases and more tolerant of price
increases, even while complaining. So they go along with a New York
merchant, for example, who has raised the price of his custom-made
suits by $100, to between $750 and $1,095.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed to be at this level three or four years ago,'' said
Andrew Kozinn, the third-generation owner of Saint Laurie Merchant
Tailors on Broadway near 19th Street. He recently opened his first
uptown store, on Park Avenue at 51st Street, to draw more customers
from the banks, investment houses and office towers in the area.
``I could not have raised my prices or opened that store,'' Kozinn
said, ``without this feeling of prosperity among so many people.''
</P>
<P>
   Merchants in general have become bolder in pushing up prices.
That is particularly the case if what they sell is much in demand
these days and short in supply, like custom-made men's suits or
rental apartments. Or they are services available from no one else
_ Walt Disney's theme parks, for example, and the state-run ferry
system that carries 25 million riders a year between Seattle and
the numerous island communities in Puget Sound.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's admission price to its theme parks in Orlando, Fla.,
rose nearly 5 percent in April, to $42, and the state-run ferry
system's tickets went up 7 percent, on average, in May. The new
fares range up to $30 on the longest route. The state ferry
commission said the increases were required to finance expansion of
the fleet; the service is heavily used by tourists and commuters.
The commuters expressed resignation. Many said, in a questionnaire,
that they had no reasonable alternative to the ferry.
</P>
<P>
   The ferry price increase, the first since 1994, reflects an
increasingly common practice in the private sector. ``Our clients
have been struggling with price resistance for so long that any
cunning they can use to grab an extra price, they use,'' said
Daniel Yankelovich, chairman of the polling company DYG, whose
clients are mostly corporations. ``The list of significant
increases is almost a profile of what people can get away with.''
</P>
<P>
   Prices in the last year have gone up significantly more than the
inflation rate in more than 30 categories. This is evident in the
data collected by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and in more than
two dozen interviews with company executives and representatives of
trade and consumer organizations.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The list includes price increases already much in the news: fees
for using automated-teller machines, for example, car rentals,
airline fares for last-minute travelers, hotel rates, monthly
apartment rentals and housing prices, although the cost of running
a house has gone down for those who have refinanced mortgages.
</P>
<P>
   Other increases run the gamut of services: legal fees, dental
care, HMO insurance premiums, parking-lot rates, some fast-food
restaurant prices, long-distance phone calls made within a state,
accountants' fees, school tuition at all levels and charges for
vehicle maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Entertainment is also more expensive _ cable television rates
are up, as are tickets to most theme parks and sports events,
entrance fees for some national parks and even wine. The price of a
funeral also keeps going up.
</P>
<P>
   Rising costs are sometimes cited as justification for the price
increases. The Boston Red Sox, in announcing a ticket price
increase at Fenway Park, argued that the money would go in part to
pay the salaries of expensive baseball players. Procter &AMP; Gamble
invoked higher paper costs as the reason for a 6 percent increase
in the prices of bath and facial tissues in January. And Burger
King blamed the rising minimum wage, which has pushed up the
earnings of many of its employees, as a reason for cutting back
sharply on the discounting of its Whopper hamburger.
</P>
<P>
   Since March, the Whopper has been sold increasingly at its full
price of $1.99 to $2.19, and the once-frequent discounts, to 99
cents, have been gradually eliminated, said Kim Miller, a Burger
King spokeswoman. ``We have decided consciously to shift the battle
to taste, not price,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is the problem of getting customers in the door.
Americans have grown accustomed to discounts and bargains, and
Burger King still offers 99-cent specials. But now it generally
features less costly food than the Whopper _ a small milkshake, for
example, or onion rings or fries. The hope is that once in the
door, customers will spring for the Whopper.
</P>
<P>
   Even Kozinn, the New York clothier, has, as a lure, a giant
yellow tape measure placed decorously in the window of his Park
Avenue store. In red ink, the word ``sale'' stands out against the
yellow background. John Lynch, a lawyer, sometimes has suits made
at Kozinn's establishment for the sale price; usually they feature
less expensive fabric. But last winter, he picked out a pricey
British cloth, a blue woolen, and paid $795 for it. That same suit,
six months earlier, had sold for $695.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very thin and I have no seat,'' he said, ``and I would
have to spend almost as much to properly tailor a suit purchased
off the rack. Still, $795 is a stretch and I would probably draw
the line if the price went up another $100, or if I got concerned
about the economy.''
</P>
<P>
   That same sort of ceiling seemed to govern an increase in pay
phone rates in many states. Deregulation permitted the increase,
but an attempt by local phone companies, which own many of the pay
phones, to impose a 50-cent minimum in some Midwestern states
resulted in a sharp decline in use. The customer resistance
disappeared at a 35-cent minimum, and that became the norm in many
states starting last October, although not in New York, which still
charges 25 cents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The notion was that the market should set the price,'' said
James Smith, a spokesman for Bell Atlantic, which provides service
in the Northeast, ``and 35 cents has turned out to be the market
price.''
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, of course, the market will have something else
to say about prices. ``It will be interesting,'' said Jackman of
the Bureau of Labor Statistics, ``to see what happens when the
economy slows down.''

 &HT;    Dentist-turned-representative fights for patient rights in
managed care debateBy Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Hunkered down over pepperoni pizza and diet cola, a
House task force on healthcare labored recently over one of the
most contentious election year issues: whether to impose federal
regulation on the nation's managed care companies.
</P>
<P>
   Bureaucratic-sounding words like ``point of service'' and
``Employment Retirement Income Security Act,'' whizzed through the
air as the group of about a dozen Republicans tried to craft a bill
that could be unveiled as early as this week.
</P>
<P>
   And the driving force making managed care into a front burner
issue, sat, some might even say as the unwanted dinner guest, at
the mahogany table in the back room of House Majority Whip Dennis
Hastert's Capitol office.
</P>
<P>
   That person is Georgia Republican Charlie Norwood, a former
dentist who has made regulating managed care his personal fight.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood rode to Congress in 1994 in large part on the coattails
of the conservative agenda espoused by fellow Georgian, House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, as well as support from the business
community. But over the last six months, Norwood has raised the ire
of both his conservative brethren and major business groups in his
quest to overhaul the way managed care is administered.
</P>
<P>
   It is an irony not lost on Norwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't elect me,'' Norwood said. ``I don't' mind going
nose to nose with leadership. As for business groups, there isn't
any way they can pressure me. I have to do what I need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last year, Norwood has been drumming up support for his
bill, commonly called the Patient Access to Responsible Care Act
(PARCA).
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, the bill would regulate the managed care industry,
which provides health care to more than 160 million Americans by
creating several consumer protections. For example, the bill would
give patients a way to appeal decisions made by their plans and
most importantly, it would allow patients to sue their health plans
for damages.
</P>
<P>
   This was seen by business groups and Republican leaders as a
``provider protection bill,'' a bill that would dramatically
increase the price of healthcare by as much as 35 percent,
according to some estimates for workers and force employers to drop
health plans altogether.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in the mold of a big-government, Democratic bill,''
said Rep. Bill McCrery, (R-La.), a task force member, who echoed
the sentiment of other Republican opponents to the bill. ``Norwood
developed legislation that he believed solved the healthcare
problems of America. Some of us thought it went too far. We said:
You're a Republican, I'm a Republican, let's hammer this out.''
</P>
<P>
   But with 230 co-sponsors signed up and President Clinton
drumming home the need to create a ``patients bill of rights,''
Republicans grew concerned. They realized they needed to bring
Norwood into the tent.
</P>
<P>
   So for the last four months, the task force has been working
with Norwood at breakfast meetings and lunches to draft a bill that
seeks seeks to improve patient rights with managed care companies
without angering the business community.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obviously an irony,'' said Bruce Josten, executive vice
president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which recently gave
Norwood an award for his voting record in Congress, yet is openly
attacking ``Dr. Norwood'' on this issue.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, Josten said, is ``like opening a field of dreams for
doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   Business groups are lobbying heavily against Norwood's bill and
there is a general sense that their efforts have paid off and that
the bill that will emerge from the task force will be far different
from what Norwood advocated.
</P>
<P>
   Even Norwood concedes that it will be different.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm realistic,'' Norwood said. ``It doesn't do me any good to
win a vote on the House floor without the Republican leadership
behind me. I could win, but what happens then?''
</P>
<P>
   Norwood is referring to what would happen to the bill if he took
it to the House floor and won. The bill would have to pass the
Senate. If it passed the Senate, the next step would be for it to
go to a committee conference , where he predicted that the
Republican leaders would massage it and change it to their liking.
</P>
<P>
   And all of that is subject to the co-sponsors keeping their
names on the list of co-sponsors. With the Republican leaders
standing in firm opposition to the bill, several Republicans said
they would hesitate to continue their support of the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Norwood is confident that he will prevail on important
parts of his bill. And he has support from groups representing
patients and healthcare providers, which have long argued that
Congress should intervene to iron out managed care problems.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans on the task force said that bill that emerges would
most likely include the following:
</P>
<P>
   _ Gag Rule: a provision in the bill giving doctors in managed
care plans the authority to outline all of the options available to
patients, despite the cost.
</P>
<P>
   _ Emergency Care: a provision sought by Norwood where insurers
would be required to pay the emergency room costs of patient care
if a ``prudent lay person'' determined that the patient's symptoms
deserved that care. This is intended to address patients who get
stuck with the bill by their insurers when their symptoms turn out
to be for a non-emergency problem, such as people who think they
are experiencing heart attacks and later find out it was heartburn.
</P>
<P>
   _ Employment Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), which has
been the most controversial element in the debate over whether to
impose federal regulations on managed care companies. Norwood
argues that the ERISA law unfairly offers employers liability
protection from the consequences of the healthcare decisions they
make that cause death or injury. Under ERISA, employees can sue
their health insurer if they believe that they have made a wrong
decision, but they are barred from obtaining punitive and
compensatory damages.
</P>
<P>
   About 125 million workers, dependents and retirees are covered
by plans subject to ERISA, according to the Labor Department.
Norwood argues that removing the bar on punitive and compensatory
damages in ERISA would force health plans to be accountable for the
decisions they make, thus improving the overall quality of
healthcare.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Lynn Adler, an advocate for the aging who enjoys the
company of people who have made it to their 100th birthdays, gave a
party recently for her centenarian friends. Nine of them showed up.
</P>
<P>
   Lloyd Botimer, 103, walked in carrying the medal he had won in
the javelin throw in the Senior Olympics three years ago. Essie
Brown, 105, who wore a blue dress and heels, let it be known that
she was looking for a dance partner. And 101-year-old Lenore
Schaeffer brought news clippings attesting to her fame as a
ballroom-dancing centenarian. Last year, she made the ``Tonight''
show with Jay Leno, and the cover of the Japanese edition of
Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
   Back in her early 90s, Mrs. Schaeffer tried to get on
``Tonight'' with Johnny Carson. ``He wrote back and said that she
was too young,'' said Mrs. Schaeffer's son, Lou Schaeffer, who is
60. ``One-hundred-one and still dancing, that's different.''
</P>
<P>
   Centenarians are not what they used to be. There are so many _
30,000 to 50,000 in the United States, according to demographers,
up from the 1980 estimate of 15,000 _ that it is hard to get a
televised 100th-birthday greeting from Willard Scott, who mentions
12 centenarians every week on the ``Today'' show. Every week about
90 new centenarians are disappointed.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, only a small number of people will live to be 100 _
one in 10,000 Americans _ and among those who do reach the century
mark, the rate of disability is high. The nine centenarians at Lynn
Adler's party, the ones who get on television and are held up as
role models, are the exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   But centenarians are proportionately the United States'
fastest-growing age group, with projections that by the middle of
the next century, more than 800,000 Americans will be over 100. And
so many are making it to 100 in relatively good health, as life
expectancies in general shoot up, that centenarians, once
sentimentalized rarities, have become a symbol of the country's age
boom and a metaphor for the dramatic shift in attitude about what
old means.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty-five is nothing,'' said Thomas Perls, a geriatrician at
Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, who is leading a
Harvard University study of centenarians. ``Eighty-five is young.
Eighty-five is 15 years away from 100.''
</P>
<P>
   Living to be 100 is no longer viewed as a quirk of nature, but
as a distinct possibility, something to be worked for. It is the
goal of the exercise and spirituality class for the aging that
Blondola Lucas, 76, a retired educator, leads at the White Rock
Baptist Church in Durham, N.C. One member of the class, James
Schooler, who can do 25 push-ups at a clip, has seven years to go.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Bortz, a gerontologist at Stanford University, has
published a self-help book, ``Dare to Be 100'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster,
1995). Ms. Adler, 50, the founder of the nonprofit National
Centenarian Awareness Project and author of a book about
centenarians, says that baby boomers have traded in their youthful
motto ``Don't trust anyone over 30'' for ``Let's live to be 100.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, attitudes toward the very old are a mixture of admiration
and dread. About 30 percent of centenarians have full command of
their faculties and are living in the community, said Leonard Poon,
director of the University of Georgia gerontology center, and the
director of a 10-year study of centenarians.
</P>
<P>
   But Poon, whose research confirmed findings of earlier studies
in Germany, said that about 45 percent of centenarians had some
sort of disability, varying in severity.
</P>
<P>
   And disability can set in well before 100. According to the
census, 47 percent of those 95 and older are in nursing homes.
(Among those 85 and older, 22 percent are in nursing homes, while
the number drops to 7 percent for those 75 to 84, and 1 percent for
people ages 65 to 74.) The average centenarian lives to be 102.
</P>
<P>
   The country's mixed perceptions of aging and longevity are
reflected by a 1996 poll for the Alliance for Aging Research.
According to the poll, 61 percent of Americans say they would like
to live to be 100, and while few expect to achieve that goal, 51
percent think they will live to be at least 80.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, a majority of Americans are anxious about
aging, with 64 percent saying they are worried about living for
years in a nursing home because of a physical frailty or long-term
illness, and 56 percent worried about developing Alzheimer's
disease.
</P>
<P>
   When people talk about wanting to live to be 100, they surely do
not have in mind being severely disabled patients in a nursing
home. The paradox, says John Rowe, president of the Mount Sinai
Hospital and School of Medicine in New York City, is that people
want to live longer, but they do not want to get older or disabled.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the Greek myths, the guy told the gods he wanted to live
forever,'' Rowe said. ``So the gods said, `OK.' But he forgot to
ask for eternal youth, and so he got older and older and older and
older, and sicker and more frail and weaker. But he never died.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been too much preoccupation with longevity,'' added
Rowe, who is the chairman of the MacArthur Foundation Research
Network on Successful Aging and the co-author of the recent book
``Successful Aging'' (Pantheon, 1998). ``We need not to look at
quantity, but at quality. I'm all for living to 100, 110 _ as long
as we're not prolonging dependency. We want to prolong active life
expectancy. If we are going to get 10 more years of life, and eight
of them are dependent, then I consider that prolonging dying rather
than prolonging living.''
</P>
<P>
   While the research is still in its early stages, Rowe and other
experts say the evidence is that life is being prolonged, that
there is a modest compression of the amount of time people spend in
poor health during their final years.
</P>
<P>
   That is the view of Perls, who is directing the Harvard study of
centenarians. Of the 160 centenarians he has studied since 1993, he
said, all have lived until 93 or 94 in ``extremely good health.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That really turns the whole idea of aging on its head,'' Perls
said. ``Most people thought, `Who would want to live to be 100
anyway, who would want to live to be very old; it just means having
all the diseases.' But it's the opposite. To get to such an age,
you have to be healthy the majority of your life.''

IT'S A STANDING (KOURNIK)OVATION

<TEXT>
<P>
   For the next two weeks at Ye Olde All-England Lawn Tennis
Championships in Londontown, there will be ye young tennis starlet
Anna Kournikova as the target of sneers and jeers, yet revered by
the media.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened last year, too. Why?
</P>
<P>
   a) 'Cause she's cute.
</P>
<P>
   b) 'Cause she knows it.
</P>
<P>
   c) 'Cause she'll probably be hanging out with that two-timer (as
in twice winner of the Stanley Cup) who maybe should be known to
the 16-year-old as ``Uncle Sergei.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that kinda kids' stuff plays in Siberia. Maybe in England,
it plays in the tabloids. But over here, where even a simple
traffic signal knows when it's right to stop and go, we tend to get
a little uptight about these March-July relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Before jetting off to the site of some of her greatest
professional triumphs, Martina Navratilova was queried about
Kournikova's sex-appeal marketing technique and how she flaunts
herself around hockeystud Sergei Fedorov .
</P>
<P>
   ``I have had a lot of people speculate on my relationships; I
won't talk about that,'' said the ex-tennis champ working on HBO's
coverage. ``She's drop-dead gorgeous, but she hasn't backed it up
on the court yet. I do have problems with people being cocky and
arrogant when they haven't won a thing.'' . . .

   _ The oldest competitor at the X-Games in San Diego is
45-year-old street luger Steve Fernando of Van Nuys. Which seems
kinda like allowing a teen-ager with shoes into the plastic ballpit
at Chuck E. Cheese. . . .
</P>
<P>
   _ Wildly opinionated Bill Walton gave this assessment to the
Boston Globe on the three UCLA players ( Toby Bailey, J.R.
Henderson and Jelani McCoy ) who think they're headed for the NBA
in Wednesday's draft: ``Toby is an incredible athlete, but he
doesn't have a real game. J.R. is going to have trouble in the NBA
playing power forward because that is where the meanest, nastiest,
dirtiest guys play. Jelani is an incredible talent, but he hasn't
yet shown he can respond to coaching.'' . . .
</P>

   _ Adidas is the top official shoe supplier to the 32-team World
Cup soccer tournament, footing the bill for seven countries. Nike
is second with six (including the U.S.). Could have been seven, but
Indonesia didn't make the field. . . .

 PHOENIX: your life.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the subjects of Perls' study is Catherine McCaig, 102,
who lives in her own home in Marshfield, Mass. Although she uses a
walker and requires the help of aides for bathing and dressing,
Mrs. McCaig still plays the piano, cooks the gourmet dishes she
watches Julia Child preparing on television and enjoys visiting
with her 93-year-old sister, Winifred Whynot, who lives across the
street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel just fine,'' Mrs. McCaig said in a recent interview.
She spent her earlier years working as a cook, a manager of a
millinery shop and a guard at the Naval Shipyard in Quincy, Mass.
Now, she said, ``I just wish I could get up and do a polka.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how old she felt, Mrs. McCaig answered, ``Ageless.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five years ago, 65 was viewed as the onset of old age.
Now the marker has been advanced considerably, with 85 the official
demarcation for what gerontologists refer to as the oldest-old, and
those 75 to 84 classified as the young-old.
</P>
<P>
   ``People used to think if you were in your 60s, you were
basically waiting to die, and in a rocker,'' said Robert Binstock,
a professor of aging, health and society at the Case Western
Reserve School of Medicine. ``When somebody died at 65, nobody
thought it was a big deal. Now, if someone dies before 80, they
would say he was a young guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Life expectancy at birth in the United States has increased
nearly 30 years since the turn of the century, from 47 to about 76
_ six years beyond the biblical life span of three score and 10. At
the same time, disability rates among older people have been
falling since the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   In her book of essays, ``The Last Gift of Time, Life Beyond
Sixty'' (Ballantine, 1997), Carolyn G. Heilbrun, the author and
retired Columbia University English professor, wrote of her
longstanding determination to commit suicide at 70. ``I had always
considered this biblical life span to be a highly reasonable one,''
she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   She had no intention of emulating the frail, elderly people she
saw around her. ``I had known so many old people whose lives seemed
to be just meaningless,'' Ms. Heilbrun explained in a recent
telephone interview from her home in New York City. ``They
complained all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   As she noted in her book, Ms. Heilbrun has changed her mind. At
72, in good health and still working away, she recently completed
four detective stories in four months under her literary pseudonym,
Amanda Cross.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea of age has changed,'' Ms. Heilbrun said. Now, she
says, she knows elderly people like Jacques Barzun, the historian.
``At 90, he is writing a cultural history of the last 500 years,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   At 102, meanwhile, Milton Garland puts in a 20-hour week as an
engineer at a refrigeration plant in Waynesboro, Pa. In March,
Garland was honored at the White House as the country's oldest
worker.
</P>
<P>
   One of the difficulties in studying centenarians, besides
recruiting subjects, is proving their age. In Georgia, for example,
where Poon recently completed his study, official birth records did
not start to be compiled until the 1920s. Names and birth dates
were passed on in family Bibles, from generation to generation,
Poon said. In addition, he said, some people exaggerate their age
out of pride, or a wish for prestige.
</P>
<P>
   He and other experts say that there are no records to
substantiate the claims of 115-year-olds in Soviet Georgia, and
that there is evidence to suggest that such people are using birth
certificates of relatives a generation or two older.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest person for whom there is extensive documentation was
Jeanne Calment of Arles, France, who died in August 1997 at age
122. Miss Calment rode a bicycle until she was 115, and lived in
her own apartment until age 110, when she moved into a nursing
home.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McCaig says she has no secrets to impart to the Harvard
researchers. She adheres to no special diet or exercise plan.
``Right now, I try to keep alive,'' Mrs. McCaig said.
</P>
<P>
   None of the centenarians in the Harvard study has smoked
cigarettes, Perls said. ``They tend to do things in moderation,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   And, not surprising, according to the studies and anecdotal
reports, one thing centenarians do not do much of is worrying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just look forward to the next day,'' said Merle McEathron,
who will turn 103 on the last day of July and was among those
eating cake at Lynn Adler's centenarian party. ``If it's nice, I go
for a walk.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McEathron, who grew up on a farm and reared two children
alone during the Depression after her first husband left her, said
her later years had been the best ones. It was not until her eighth
decade that she was able to stop working, as a restaurant hostess
and hotel cashier.
</P>
<P>
   At 80, she was married for the fourth time, to a retired Navy
admiral one year her junior. ``That was the love of my life,
honey,'' she said. He died 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. McEathron lives in her own apartment in an assisted-living
center. She enjoys a daily glass of wine. And, she said, ``I salt
everything.''

TIME ORDERS INVESTIGATION ON ACCURACY OF CNN REPORT
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By LAWRIE MIFFLIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Doubts raised about the accuracy of a recent article that was
published in Time magazine but was written by Cable News Network
journalists are serious enough that Time's editors have ordered a
further investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The article asserted that the U.S. military dropped lethal nerve
gas on a Laotian village in 1970, during the Vietnam war, as part
of a secret mission to kill American defectors.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of Time that appears Monday carries a letter to
readers from the managing editor, Walter Isaacson, telling them
that the magazine is now doing its own reporting on the matter and
will correct any mistakes or clarify any disputes in future issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I trust CNN's journalistic standards,'' Isaacson said in an
interview on Friday. ``They did a story for us that was based on a
lot of evidence. If some of that evidence is now suspect, that is
something we plan to report to our readers, once we get to the
bottom of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The article appeared in Time the morning after the television
version of the report was broadcast on the debut edition of a new
CNN program called ``Newsstand: CNN and Time,'' an unusual
collaboration between the two news organizations, which are both
owned by Time Warner Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of the June 7 broadcast, CNN's report was
criticized as false, the producers were accused of ignoring or
suppressing evidence that undercut their poison-gas thesis, and
Time's rival, Newsweek, had begun work on an article that, when
published the next week, would be an attempt to rebut much of the
report.
</P>
<P>
   Ten days after the broadcast, CNN's own military analyst, a
retired major general with a Ph.D. in international relations from
Columbia University, resigned in protest, calling the report false
and noting he was not consulted during its preparation.
</P>
<P>
   CNN's own producers created some of the suspicion, by choosing
not to reveal a noteworthy fact about one of their most important
sources.
</P>
<P>
   The accusation that sarin, a nerve gas banned by international
law, was used during Operation Tailwind, code-named for the secret
forays in Laos, is made most vigorously in the CNN report by two
soldiers who were there for one operation in 1970, Michael Hagen
and Robert Van Buskirk. But Van Buskirk told April Oliver, CNN's
main producer on this report, that he had repressed all memory of
that day's events for 24 years, from 1974, when he had a religious
awakening, until Ms. Oliver began questioning him.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ms. Oliver, who began work on the report last September, and
Jack Smith, a veteran CNN producer who joined her on the project in
February, decided to exclude mention of Van Buskirk's
recovered-memory revelation from their report. Nor did it appear in
the Time magazine article, co-authored by Ms. Oliver and Peter
Arnett, the CNN correspondent on the televised report.
</P>
<P>
   John Stacks, an executive editor at Time who works on the
Newsstand collaboration, said he had known about Van Buskirk's
repressed memories of the foray, which included an incident in the
Laotian village where Van Buskirk said he chased a blond American
defector and presumably killed him by throwing a grenade into a
hole into which the man had fled.
</P>
<P>
   ``April, with Jack's supervision, wrote that piece so it was her
call,'' Stacks said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith of CNN said: ``My reason was I felt so strongly that he
was telling us what really happened in that camp, and one of his
commando mates, Hagen, had also told us he remembers seeing that
blond fellow coming toward Van Buskirk.''
</P>
<P>
   Stacks said he had read CNN's background briefing book, which
contained transcripts of interviews, memos about off-camera
interviews, and scientific research about nerve gas, and was
confident of the report's accuracy. He also noted that Van Buskirk
was not CNN's only source.
</P>
<P>
   Two other soldiers from Operation Tailwind who appeared in the
CNN report, Jim Cathy and Jay Graves, said they believed nerve gas
had been dropped. The retired admiral who was then chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, Thomas Moorer, now 86 years old, also
appears on camera but his comments are ambiguous; Arnett's
narration says that Moorer admitted off-camera that nerve gas had
been used.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the report cites ``senior American military
officials'' as confirming that nerve gas was used in Operation
Tailwind, and Arnett, in an interview to be broadcast Monday on
National Public Radio's ``On The Media,'' said that CNN ``can prove
documentarily that it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Eugene McCarley, the Tailwind commander that day, appears
in the CNN report but has since complained that general comments
were used out of context to buttress the specific nerve-gas
allegation. But CNN did use his comment, ``I never, ever considered
the use of lethal gas, not on any of my operations.''
</P>
<P>
   On the next week's edition of ``Newsstand,'' June 14, CNN gave
an update, noting that the Pentagon had ordered an investigation
but had also said that the gases used in Operation Tailwind were
most likely a tear gas and one used to induce vomiting. Three more
soldiers from the Tailwind operation also appeared June 14,
describing a gas that was ``more potent than tear gas'' and was
called ``knockout gas.''
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Perry Smith, retired, the military analyst who
resigned from CNN after seven years as a consultant, said he had
contacted the soldiers interviewed for the ``Newsstand'' report,
and several had told him that Ms. Oliver ``planted'' the idea that
sarin had been the gas used that day in Laos, even telling one man
that his commanders had lied when they told him it was tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, the co-producer, speaking for himself and Ms. Oliver,
flatly denied that. ``We did not lead people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. Smith did not learn of the ``Newsstand'' report's
content until he saw a promotional spot for it. Asked why CNN did
not consult its military expert on such a sensitive military
report, Steve Haworth, the network's chief spokesman said, ``Senior
executives in charge of the investigation felt it was unnecessary
to consult him because they were confident of the resources they
already had at their disposal.''
</P>
<P>
   Haworth also said that Tom Johnson, president of CNN, and
Richard Kaplan, president of CNN/U.S., were unavailable for
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Three military experts told The New York Times that the use of
nerve gas in the Laotian foray described in the CNN report would
have been impossible: Thomas Stump, a former Air Force pilot who
flew two rescue missions for the unit that included Van Buskirk and
Hagen; Richard Shultz, a professor at the Fletcher School of Law
and Diplomacy at Tufts University who has spent the last three
years writing a history of the secret operations in Southeast Asia
during the war, and Maj. Gen. Smith.
</P>
<P>
   They said that extremely potent forms of tear gas can cause the
symptoms described by the Tailwind veterans in CNN's report _
vomiting, loss of bowel control, falling to the ground _ and that
such gases were often used in rescue missions such as the one Stump
flew the day Hagen, Van Buskirk, Cathy, Graves and McCarley were
rescued in Laos.
</P>
<P>
   Had the gas used been nerve gas, they said, helicopter pilots
and bomber pilots would have been warned and equipped with gas
masks, which did not happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on the radio with McCarley when he got gassed,'' Stump
said. ``He didn't have a gas mask on, for sure. He would have been
dead if that gas had been sarin.''

 &HT;    Low attendance may result in date change
 &HT;    By Chip Towers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A day after an exciting Georgia-Florida High School
All-Star Game was played in the Georgia Dome, Scottish Rite
Festival organizers already were contemplating the game's future.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia won the 14th annual meeting 23-21 Saturday night on
Chance Gwaltney's 33-yard field goal with no time remaining. The
victory shaved Florida's advantage in the series to 6-5-3.
</P>
<P>
   But attendance at the game remains a concern. Only 9,768 bought
tickets to Saturday night's contest, an increase of about 1,400
over last year. Scottish Rite Festival executive director Shelton
Stevens said Sunday he expects total attendance, which includes
spectators who attended on complimentary and sponsorship passes, to
be ``about 12 or 13'' thousand, well below the pre-game stated goal
of 15,000.
</P>
<P>
   That has given cause for game organizers to consider alternative
formats for the game. The most recent option being discussed is to
conduct the game in conjunction with the Peach Bowl in late
December.
</P>
<P>
   Stevens said that option is on the agenda for discussion in a
meeting with Peach Bowl organizers in the next week to 10 days.
There are numerous complications, however. Foremost is a Georgia
High School Association rule that makes players ineligible to play
any other high school sports if they participate in an all-star
game during the academic school year. Florida has a similar rule
but it only jeopardizes eligibility in the same sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have to sell this to the high school coaches,''
Stevens said. ``Right now we're just discussing all the
capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Injuries remain a serious concern of both college coaches and
the game's organizers. The University of Florida had a particularly
bad week this year as two of its signees suffered major injuries.
John Capel of Brooksville, Fla., generally considered the top
receiver prospect in the country, dislocated an elbow in practice
and had to have surgery to repair nerve damage. Albany's (Ga.)
Chucky Marks suffered a knee injury in Saturday night's game. As a
result, both players may have to sit out their freshman seasons
with the Gators.
</P>
<P>
   Those injuries represent one of the Scottish Rite's strongest
arguments for a December game.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're still in football shape, so there's less of a chance
of getting injured and, if they are, the kids would have an
opportunity to recover,'' Stevens said.

`THE TRIAL OF SACCO AND VANZETTI': EXAMINATION OF A FLAWED TRIAL
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are
for New York area. Check local listings.) 
(ja) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After almost eight decades of charges and
countercharges, investigations, debates, protests and tears, the
question of whether Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti (or one of
them) committed the crimes for which they were executed in August
1927 remains in dispute. Historical consensus seems to have been
reached, however, that their trial was marred by the biases of the
period and by dubious prosecutorial tactics.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the import of ``The Trial of Sacco and Vanzetti,''
Tuesday's Court TV offering in its series ``The Greatest Trials of
All Time,'' a curious rubric for a case that still brings shame to
America's criminal justice system.
</P>
<P>
   Attention is rightly drawn to the nation's post-World War I Red
scare, when radicals like Sacco and Vanzetti, Italian anarchists,
were rounded up, beaten and deported. The evidence against the two,
arrested in a payroll robbery and murders in 1920 in Braintree,
Mass., was contradictory; the prosecution played heavily on their
radical beliefs, and the judge reminded the jury of its duty to God
and country.
</P>
<P>
   The program lays out the details of the case in a necessarily
sketchy way, but despite a general sympathy for the accused,
incriminating details are not omitted. Despite protests around the
world, their appeals failed, and ``The Trial of Sacco and
Vanzetti'' leaves us with Vanzetti's famous last words to the
court, about ``the taking of our lives, the lives of a good
shoemaker and a poor fish peddler,'' without noting that their
authorship has been questioned. A more practical legacy was a
reform in the state's judicial procedures.
</P>
<P>
   In 1977 Michael Dukakis, then the governor of Massachusetts,
issued a proclamation apologizing for the conduct of the trial
without taking a position on the men's guilt or innocence. That
combination of agnosticism toward the crime and indignation toward
the process reflects current historical opinion pretty well.
</P>
<P>
   Coming up on Court TV over the next few months: ``The Scottsboro
Boys,'' ``The Scopes Monkey Trial'' and ``The Trial of Julius and
Ethel Rosenberg.''

<P>
   In a bid to make computer networks as common in homes as they
are in offices, 11 high technology companies including IBM, Lucent
and Compaq have teamed up to develop standards for systems that
transmit data at high speeds over the copper telephone wiring
inside almost every house and apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The companies intend to announce the formation of the group,
called the Home Phoneline Networking Alliance, Monday at the
Digital Living Room conference in Laguna Hills, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Prodded by the computer industry, the telephone and cable
television industries have been rushing to develop new ways to link
homes to cyberspace at speeds that far exceed those possible using
today's common modems.
</P>
<P>
   The nation's large local phone carriers have joined with Compaq
Computer Corp., Intel Corp. and Microsoft Corp. in a group called
the Universal ADSL Consortium in an attempt to deliver torrents of
data over phone wires. Many of the nation's largest cable
television companies have formed a venture called At Home to do the
same thing using cable systems.
</P>
<P>
   But those initiatives have done little to address how computers
and other advanced electronic devices communicate within homes. The
consortium being announced Monday plans to use telephone wiring to
create fast in-home networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``By using phone lines, consumers don't have to rewire the
house, they don't have to put in any external hubs, they don't have
to add any connections,'' said Mark Carpenter, director for
Internet and home networking for Compaq, the No. 1 maker of
personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   The group plans to publish its first technical standards in the
third quarter and expects its members to ship products based on the
technology by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Compaq, for instance, could include plug-in cards in its
computers that allow users to make an in-home network simply by
plugging computers into standard telephone jacks.
</P>
<P>
   The consortium expects its efforts to enable data-transmission
rates of up to one megabit a second. That is more than 20 times the
speeds generally made possible by today's telephone modems but is
much slower than the speeds used in modern office networks.
</P>
<P>
   Carpenter said the technology would allow people to use their
telephones in the standard fashion even as the same wires carry
Internet data between machines.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Tony Grewe, an applications strategy manager for Lucent
Technology Inc.'s microelectronics unit, said the group at Lucent
that was working with the new group was separate from the task
force working with the ADSL consortium, but that the two groups
consult regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Besides games, most people would seem to have little use for a
quick in-home network if the home itself had no high-speed link to
the outside world.
</P>
<P>
   The core technology for the group's efforts is being provided by
two small private companies, Tut Systems Inc., based in Pleasant
Hill, Calif., and Epigram Inc., based in Sunnyvale, Calif. The
other members of the group are 3Com Corp., Advanced Micro Devices
Inc., AT&AMP;T Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., Intel and Rockwell
International.
</P>
<P>
   Notably, the group does not include any local phone companies.
``The phone companies have no control over these lines inside
houses,'' Carpenter said.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T is not in the local phone business in a major way, but its
wireless unit is leading the company's involvement with the home
networking consortium. AT&AMP;T has explored the use of wireless
technology to offer routine local phone service. So far, those
efforts have borne little fruit in the market.

<P>
   JUNIK, Yugoslavia _ A half dozen gaunt, unshaven, villagers,
some clutching old hunting rifles, peered nervously around the side
of a stone barn.
</P>
<P>
   On the road in front of the barn, they had dumped two spiked
metal tracks from an old haying machine on the cobblestones to
block traffic. Another group of men, most in motley camouflage
uniforms, darted behind a barricade a few yards away. They peered
out from behind the pile of old planks, tires, bricks and sacks
filled with dirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Snipers,'' hissed Shaiquer Maloku, 31, one of the villagers,
warning a visitor. ``Move out of the road. A man was shot and
killed here two days ago by the Serbs. Come into the barn.''
</P>
<P>
   The rebels here in the Southern Serbian province of Kosovo,
fighting to carve an independent state from one of the two
republics that remain in Yugoslavia, have dug trenches around
villages they control. Joined by the men who remain in the
villages, they have set up sandbagged roadblocks, where they
politely check the documents of those who enter their ``liberated
zones,'' and they talk heroically of fighting to the death.
</P>
<P>
   Many have been lulled into believing that the curtain will never
close on this heady period of their revolt. Rebel leaders naively
insist that they can muster enough force with their light weaponry
and poorly trained volunteers to defend towns and positions against
a mechanized assault by Yugoslav troops.
</P>
<P>
   On the hills and roads surrounding rebel-held areas, now as much
as 40 percent of the province, the government of Yugoslavia, of
which Serbia is one of two remaining republics, is positioning
hulking tanks. It also has sent armored personnel carriers and
spider webs of green camouflage netting that mask huge howitzers as
well as mortar and sniper positions.
</P>
<P>
   The government troops are slowly strangling the rebel
strongholds, having seized the main road between Pec and Djakovica
from the insurgents over the past few days. The shattered houses
along the road, many with gaping holes, speak of fierce combat.
</P>
<P>
   Serbia, for its part, at times seems as oblivious as the rebels
to the reality of its position, apparently ignoring the likely
long-range impact of the fury provoked by its counterinsurgency
sweeps, which have left over 300 people dead and caused 80,000
people to be displaced from their homes since March.
</P>
<P>
   Since these assaults began, the ethnic Albanians who make up 90
percent of the province's 2 million people have largely abandoned a
tactic of peaceful resistance in their drive for independence.
</P>
<P>
   War has a choreography that only its participants understand.
Fighters, locked in an embrace, feel out the daily beat and rhythm
until the set is shattered by a surge of violence. The old order is
then replaced with another, just as ephemeral as the last.
</P>
<P>
   Such a dance is under way in Kosovo, where armed peasant farmers
and other residents, joined by hundreds of rebels who have picked
up weapons and uniforms over the border in northern Albania, are
facing down 50,000 government soldiers and special police.
</P>
<P>
   In this village, about 40 miles southwest of Pristina, the
provincial capital, the men in the camouflage gear wear baseball
caps with red patches that show the black double-headed Albanian
eagle and the initials UCK, the Albanian acronym for the rebel
Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   The long, black snout of a captured 20 mm anti-aircraft canon
sticks out from the little fort toward the deserted road, strewn
with rocks and branches, that meanders out of the village.
</P>
<P>
   Two miles north, on the main road that has been recaptured, a
26-year-old Serbian police officer said, ``The terrorists held this
road for 15 days. We have taken it back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything to the left or the right of the road belongs to the
terrorists,'' added the officer, who spoke on condition of
anonymity. ``This is a war. We are doing what any police officer
anywhere in the world would do when being attacked by armed groups
_ trying to stomp them out and restore order.''
</P>
<P>
   The throaty rattle of a heavy machine gun mounted on a nearby
hill interrupted the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shot at us,'' said the officer, nonplused. ``We are
answering back.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States, in an effort to stay the hand of Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic, has threatened NATO intervention
unless the soldiers are withdrawn from the province and
negotiations with a moderate ethnic Albanian leader, Ibrahim
Rugova, are resumed.
</P>
<P>
   It increasingly appears, however, that Milosevic is biding his
time until he sees an opportune moment to strike to wipe out the
rebellion. That moment may not be far away, given the bickering
within NATO over what to do in Kosovo with some nations, but not
the United States, saying that intervention requires U.N.
authorization.
</P>
<P>
   But a push to wipe out the rebel zones would be likely to force
the insurgents to move into the hills, to build smaller, more
fluid, bands and to widen the scope of the war _ perhaps bringing
it into Pristina. It would also create scores of new martyrs, the
fuse that ignited the current rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   It was the earlier crackdown on the ethnic Albanian separatists
that led hundreds, and perhaps thousands, of ethnic Albanians who
had left Kosovo seeking new opportunities to quit their jobs in
Germany and Switzerland over the past several weeks and to travel
to northern Albania to join the rebel movement. Any prolonged war
also has the danger of drawing Albania, already a staging area and
sanctuary for the rebels, and Macedonia, which also has a restive
ethnic Albanian minority, into the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Junik, Maloku, an architect wearing a green ammunitions pouch
strapped over his sweater and carrying an AK-47 assault rifle,
stood with a half dozen of his neighbors under the peaked barn roof
with its dark oak beams. The tractors, wooden rakes, buckets, empty
animal stalls and faint scent of machine oil gave to the cool
interior a sense of bucolic peace that helped soften the signs of
brutality outside. On the stucco walls of the house that faces the
barn are splotch marks from shrapnel explosions and drill-like
holes from sniper bullets.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us want a war,'' he said. ``We believe we have been
given no choice. It is the only way we will be free.''
</P>
<P>
   The red tiled roofs of a housing complex, now being used as a
Yugoslav government military base, are visible through the canopy
of trees less than half a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   The base was being reinforced Saturday with 120 special police
in blue helmets and flak jackets. The police were arriving crouched
down in the back of flatbed trucks with heavy metal plating on the
sides. The rust-colored plates with rectangular gun slits, were
apparently welded onto the trucks to protect the police from
ambushes by the guerrillas who control swathes of territory in the
border region with Albania and who have held Junik for three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Gani Shehu, 31, a stocky lawyer, is the president of the local
Democratic League of Kosovo, the ethnic Albanian party in Kosovo
led by the Rugova, who advocates peaceful change. Shehu spoke about
the conflict Saturday as he sat in his living room. A neighbor
whose mother had been killed by a Serb shell squatted over a small,
blue propane burner heating Turkish coffee in a small red metal
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Shehu spoke about the attack on May 29, when Serb forces dropped
grenades and mortars on Junik for 12 hours, sending the 12,000
villagers _ along with 6,000 people there who had been driven out
of neighboring villages _ fleeing into the woods. A half dozen
people were killed and scores were injured.
</P>
<P>
   The attack, like most along the border, was apparently intended
to depopulate the border villages and to form an empty buffer zone
to thwart the smuggling of weapons and fighters from Albania.
</P>
<P>
   Serb helicopters, while never firing directly on the frightened
groups of villagers taking shelter in the trees, hovered overhead
after the attacks and let off machine gun bursts near the clusters
of people, those in Junik said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Serbs were warning us that we had to go to Albania,'' said
Shehu, who sat with his shoes off but with an AK-47 assault rifle
propped up on the couch next to him. ``After two days our women and
children set out in long columns to cross the mountains. Most men
stayed behind, or came back after taking their families to Albania,
to defend the village.''
</P>
<P>
   With most of its houses damaged and its streets empty save for
improvised log barricades and debris from the shelling, Junik looks
desolate and still. Men with assault rifles flit in and out of the
shadows, appearing in doorways of broken homes and then backing
away into the gloomy interiors. A handful of elderly people who
could not make the 15-hour trek over the mountains and two Yugoslav
army deserters from Montenegro _ the other remaining republic in
Yugoslavia _ live with the outgunned band in this beleaguered
redoubt.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play soccer with the Montenegrans,'' said one rebel. ``We
treat them as if they were in their own country. They will go home
soon.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serb snipers, to keep those bottled up in the town on edge,
fire off a few rounds a day. There is desultory mortar fire. The
fields are untended because the farmers fear being exposed to the
snipers. Electricity and phone service have been cut, and food is
growing scarce.
</P>
<P>
   The noose is being tightened around the town. Serb troops mined
the routes leading from Junik into Albania a week ago, the
villagers said. They said that the troops have looted and burned
five neighboring villages _ Molic, Brovina, Ponosevac, Popovac and
Morina _ in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is getting harder to move between villages along the
border,'' said Shehu. ``We can still do it, but we have to be
careful. We are cut off from Albania.''
</P>
<P>
   Those in the village appeared not fully aware of the weight of
the Serb firepower that awaited them up the road. They vowed they
would not flee. When asked if they were members of the guerrilla
movement they were hesitant and unsure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is a member'' now, said Shehu, after some thought.
``The important thing is that we were born here and we will die
here. Let the Serbs come.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope that NATO will intervene, like it did in Bosnia, to
save us. We hope the Kosovo Liberation Army will send fighters to
help us if we are attacked. But even if we are left here alone, we
will defend our village.''
</P>
<P>
   Billows of black smoke spiraled into a crystal blue sky from a
lumberyard that had been set alight not far from the Serb
positions. A Serb helicopter flew toward Junik and then turned in a
wide arc toward the border, the thumping of its blades gradually
fading away.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day after the grenade attack I knew it was time to send my
wife and two small girls to Albania,'' said Maloku, the architect.
``I knew the shelling was only the beginning. I could not go with
them. I have had enough of being treated like this by the Serbs. I
told my wife to leave, that I would see her again in a free
Kosovo.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked what his wife said before she left for Albania he
lowered his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``She could not speak,'' he said.

A CORNUCOPIA OF KOURNIKOVA SITES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forget Wimbledon. Ben Grosman says he's seen enough of Anna
Kournikova.
</P>
<P>
   And he has a Web site dedicated to the 16-year-old Russian
beauty to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   Grosman, a Sydney, Australia, resident who claims the site he
built last July called ``Anna Kournikova: A Rising Star''
(!bold!http://www.annak.com!off!) was the first of its kind,
presently writes on his home page he is ``on the verge of shutting
down'' his cybershrine, in part because he is ``sick of putting
hours of work into this site and finding it constantly
plagiarized.''
</P>
<P>
   But the other reason seems more perturbing to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting sick of how many other sites are willing to show
pictures of Anna in revealing poses . . . with no respect for
decency or privacy,'' Grosman writes.
</P>
<P>
   So (begin ital)there's(end ital) the person on the 'Net with a
conscious.
</P>
<P>
   Grosman's disenchantment can be traced to the list of Kournikova
sites through a simple search-engine check.
</P>
<P>
   The best example of the Kournikova Internet boom is on the ring
of Kournikova sites
(!bold!http://www.bomis.com/rings/Kournikova!off!). Among the links
to 59 homemade tributes are titles such as:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Anna, Anna, Anna'';
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Anna Aphrodisiac'' (which ``unlocks the wonder and
greatness'' of the ``sexiest girls in the world'');
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Obsessive Anna Kournikova Page'' (which has Kournikova's
name plate pasted over Martina Hingis on a site produced by the
humorous guys at Netmonkey Magazine);
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Scherfi's HOT PICTURES of Anna Kournikova'' (which has moved
and is currently inoperable);
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Anna Kournikova and the Temple of Babes;''
</P>
<P>
   _ ``TonZ of Anna Images'' (more than 600 of 'em);
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Complete Idiot Annamaniacs Page'' (which includes a
place to take e-mail shots at her reputed boyfriend, Sergei
Fedorov).
</P>
<P>
   And Teri Hatcher thought she had all the young Websurfers' eyes
glued to her.
</P>
<P>
   Grosman is soliciting e-mail responses (bgrosmanhealey.com.au)
to his threat to dismantle his site.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not Anna's e-mail address,'' he reminds us, ``so don't
e-mail me if all you want to tell Anna is how much you love her.''

CONFERENCE TAKES ON INTERNET PRIVACY AGAIN

   Conference Takes On Internet Privacy Again
</P>
<P>
   If the Commerce Department's weekly conference calls are any
indication, the chief result of its summit meeting on Internet
privacy in Washington this week will very likely be frustration on
all sides.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly 75 representatives from government, industry and
civil liberties groups burning up the phone lines during marathon
sessions recently on such topics as children's privacy and
legislative alternatives to self-regulation, the dialogue has
followed a distinctly predictable pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Industry says, `This is what we're doing to protect privacy;
we say, `It's not enough,''' Mark Rotenberg, the director of the
Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington, said in an
interview. ``It's kind of a nightmare actually.''
</P>
<P>
   Arguing that the growth of the Internet and electronic commerce
depends on the government's staying out of the way, the Clinton
administration has advocated a policy of self-policing to address
widespread concern by Internet users over their personal privacy on
line. But in the wake of a Federal Trade Commission report that
found the online industry had taken virtually no steps over the
last year to ensure consumer privacy, that position is getting
harder to defend.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the agenda for this week's privacy conference is
chock-full of industry panels with titles like ``Evaluating the
Effectiveness of Self-Regulation.''
</P>
<P>
   And a group of about 50 companies and associations is set to
announce the creation of an ``online privacy alliance,'' whose
members will have to take a pledge to participate in ``effective
and appropriate self-regulatory enforcement activities and
mechanisms.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the summit meeting, the Commerce Department is
supposed to submit its own report to President Clinton next month
evaluating the state of online privacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I expect that on the first of July we'll be able to say
effective self-regulation is in place; no, absolutely not,'' said
Becky Burr, the assistant secretary of commerce. ``But somebody
told me U.S. businesses often rally in the last few minutes of the
game.'' _ AMY HARMON
</P>
<P>
   Copyright Treaty Raises Concerns on Research
</P>
<P>
   Legislation intended to strengthen international copyright
protections in cyberspace has run into an unexpected enemy: some of
the United States' best computer-security experts.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed bill would ratify two international treaties
negotiated under the authority of the World Intellectual Property
Organization, both of which have the backing of some of the
nation's largest media companies and software publishers.
</P>
<P>
   But language in the House bill, which is expected to come before
the Commerce Committee this week, has alarmed computer security
experts, who say that House Resolution 2281 would make it illegal
for them to carry out their basic work in testing computer security
by barring attempts to break the security safeguards used to
prevent unauthorized copying of creative work published on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should security products be exempt from Consumer
Reports-style analysis?'' said Bruce Schneier, president of
Counterpane Systems, a security consulting firm in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   But backers of the House bill said that the proposed law was
broader than the treaty because it was intended to keep people from
undermining online copyright protection.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was sent forward by the House Commerce Subcommittee on
Telecommunications, Trade and Consumer Protection last week, and is
to be reviewed this week by the full House Commerce Committee. _

<P>
   Small Start-Up to Offer First HDTV Broadcasts
</P>
<P>
   After years of high-profile planning for high-definition
television, the first regularly scheduled national HDTV broadcasts
will be by a company with a decidedly low profile.
</P>
<P>
   The start-up company, Unity Motion, based in St. Louis, plans to
transmit its first experimental programming Tuesday at a
demonstration in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to show that we really can broadcast,'' said Sean
Henry, a company vice president. ``Up to now we've just been a
small company nobody's ever heard of.''
</P>
<P>
   Unity Motion, which was founded six years ago, received a
financial infusion in February from Marion Bass Securities, a
venture capital firm in Charlotte, N.C. Using that money, Unity
Motion has ambitious plans for a direct-broadcast satellite HDTV
service.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in September and using leased space on a Telstar
satellite, the company intends to begin full-time broadcasting of
two channels of high-definition programming _ movies, sports and
other entertainment shows, from programmers still to be announced.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of 1998, the company hopes to have four to six
channels on the air and 30 within two years.
</P>
<P>
   As with all early HDTV broadcasts, receiving the service will
require real motivation on the part of the consumer. A subscriber
will need a small satellite dish and a Unity Motion receiver box
that, together, will sell for $2,495.
</P>
<P>
   These will not be compatible with other satellite television
services. Until the first HDTV sets go on sale in the fall at a
price of $7,000 or more, the only televisions capable of displaying
these or any other HDTV signals will be expensive projection TV
sets capable of showing high-resolution images.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps to give consumers a financial breather, Unity Motion
will not begin charging its monthly subscription fee of $30 or $40
until next spring. _ JOEL BRINKLEY

GERMANY RALLIES TO TIE YUGOSLAVIA 2-2 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LENS, France _ When it ended with Jurgen Klinsmann surrounded on
a stretcher and Lothar Matthaus alone in the record books, the
Germans were the happier team, but it was not because they had
beaten the Yugoslavs.
</P>
<P>
   It was because they had done what German teams were doing long
before East and West came together. They had rousted themselves
from a funk and rallied: scoring two goals in the final 16 minutes
to salvage a 2-2 draw and preserve their share of first place in
Group F.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you would have told me before the game that we would tie
Germany, I would have been happy, but that doesn't mean I'm happy
now,'' said Yugoslav striker Predrag Mijatovic, whose team's next
opponent is the United States.
</P>
<P>
   This was a gripping match, full of odd bounces and odd plot
twists, but once again in this World Cup, violence outside the
stadium shifted some of the focus off events inside the stadium. A
French policeman and a Brazilian reporter were injured seriously in
separate incidents involving Germans who were in Lens for the game.
The policeman reportedly was hit in the back of the head with an
iron bar and was hospitalized in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   Two German fans also were sentenced to short prison sentences
after clashing with police in Paris on June 15 before Germany
played its opening match against the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The last team to play the Americans in this tournament will be
the Yugoslavs, who can be sure of advancing to the second round
with another draw. The Americans have no chance of advancing after
their emotional loss Sunday night against Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ``We plan on playing the United States the same way we played
today: very aggressively from the start,'' said Mijatovic, one of
Europe's best players. ``That match is very, very important to us
and our country.''
</P>
<P>
   The Germans actually pressed harder than the Yugoslavs at the
start Sunday, but they quickly lost their enthusiasm when Mijatovic
struck a ball with his right foot in the direction of the German
goal. His 19-year-old teammate Dejan Stankovic sprinted toward it,
one step ahead of Jeremies, the fleet German midfielder. Stankovic
extended his leg. The ball brushed past it, deflected off the knee
of disoriented German goalkeeper Andreas Kopke and ricocheted off
the far post, bouncing off Jeremies' upper chest into the goal.
</P>
<P>
   Though Stankovic appeared to play more of a passive than active
role in that complicated process, the gifted teen-ager was awarded
his first and probably not last World Cup goal. The Yugoslavs were
on their way to dominating the opening half in style, and if not
for some fine saves from Kopke, they might have increased their
lead in a hurry.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At halftime, German coach Berti Vogts substituted 37-year-old
Lothar Matthaus for Dietmar Hamann in midfield. Matthaus was not
supposed to be part of this German team at age 37, but after star
sweeper Mathias Sammer was unable to recover from a series of
injuries, Vogts swallowed his pride and reached out to the
outspoken veteran he once had vowed would never play for him again.
Matthaus' appearance made him the first man to play in 22 games in
the World Cup finals and it drew him even with former Mexican
goalkeeper Antonio Carbajal, the only other player to appear in
five World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I'm not indifferent,'' Matthaus said.
</P>
<P>
   But drawing even with Yugoslavia, not Carbajal, was the more
urgent objective, and it didn't help Germany's chances when the
normally reliable Kopke mishandled a low, well-struck shot from
striker Darko Kovacevic. The ball slipped through his arms and
bounced in front of the charging Yugoslav captain Dejan Stankovic,
who joyfully gave his team a 2-0 lead in the 54th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Vogts, thoroughly underwhelmed by his players' performance,
would substitute twice more, and in the 74th minute, one of those
substitutes, Michael Tarnat, unleashed a long free kick that
deflected off Mihajlovic's right leg and into the goal. Suddenly,
the urgency and intensity missing from Germany's play since the
opening minutes was back, and on a corner kick in the 80th minute,
Bierhoff rose high between two defenders and headed home the
equalizer.
</P>
<P>
   Six minutes later, Klinsmann rose high in a German wall and took
a Mihajlovic free kick in the side of the chest. He dropped to the
ground and stayed there in a semi-conscious state as team doctors
sprinted to his side. The game would continue, but Klinsmann's role
in it had ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``It struck me in the liver, and it was very painful; for a few
seconds, I didn't know where I was,'' he explained after
recovering.
</P>
<P>
   It was a day for German recoveries, and though they still share
the lead in Group F, the Germans did not share the Yugoslavs' pain
as they left Lens and began preparing to face Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to turn what was nearly a defeat into what was
nearly a victory,'' Vogts said.

POPE URGES AUSTRIA'S BISHOPS TO END THEIR BICKERING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIENNA, Austria _ Seeking to restore discipline to Austria's
deeply divided Roman Catholic Church, Pope John Paul II instructed
the country's bishops Sunday to stop their public bickering.
Without unity, the pope warned, ``the teachings of Christ dissolve
into many individual voices. In the place of harmony comes noisy
confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   Austria, which is 78 percent Catholic, is a prosperous country
swept by the kind of religious disaffection and dissent that runs
throughout Western Europe and the United States and that that is
the bane of John Paul II's pontificate in his twilight years.
</P>
<P>
   On his three-day visit, which ended Sunday, the pope's three
Masses were eagerly attended by believers, but the crowds were
small and restrained compared with the vast and jubilant seas of
humanity that greeted him on recent trips to Nigeria and Cuba, poor
nations hungry for the solace and attention of the bishop of Rome.
</P>
<P>
   The pope came on a pastoral mission to try to heal a vast rift
within the Austrian church _ and among its leaders _ that has
opened up since his last visit in 1988. The leader of the church
here, Cardinal Christoph Schoenborn spoke of the problems very
directly in his words of welcome to the pope before Sunday's Mass,
speaking of the ``conflicts in our church which have caused some
people to lose confidence in the pope and his bishops.''
</P>
<P>
   But the pope did not indulge those Catholics who for the last
few years have been demanding sweeping reform and democratization
of the church. Nor did he address the sex scandal that forced the
resignation of a cardinal and which remains a deeply contested
issue. Throughout his trip, he urged Austrians and other rich
Europeans to return to religion, calling for ``hearts that beat not
just for career and money, but for God and mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope, who Sunday beatified three saints, including Restituta
Kafka, a nun who was beheaded by the Nazis, also spoke of the need
for Christians to reconcile with Jews. As he spoke to 50,000 people
assembled on Heldenplatz (Heroes Square), the site where several
hundred thousand Austrians rushed to greet Hitler after the
Anschluss in 1938, the pope reminded his audience of that day.
``Sixty years ago a man declared himself the Savior,'' he said.
``The new saints carry another message: salvation is not in man,
but in Christ.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   As he delivered his homilies, he made clear that his opposition
to issues dear to reformers has not wavered. And perhaps most
emphatically, he told the bishops of Austria, who are also divided
along ideological lines, to shape up.
</P>
<P>
   ``One bishop alone does not realize the project of Christ,'' the
pope said in a speech to the leaders of the church. ``A promising
process of dialogue can be disrupted by a premature or inadequate
involvement of public opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   The pope's remarks followed a highly public comment by one
bishop that had already riveted Austrian Catholics. At a mass
Saturday in the small town of St. Poelton, its conservative bishop,
Kurt Krenn, departed from his prepared text and offered a prayer
for Cardinal Hans Hermann Groer, who was forced to resign in 1995
amid allegations that he sexually molested young men in a monastery
20 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The scandal, which re-erupted in January after a priest made
fresh charges, was so politically stormy among Catholics that
Groer's successor, Schoenborn, announced in April that the charges
were true and apologized for Groer's actions.
</P>
<P>
   Krenn, however, remained loyal to Groer, and dismissed the
priest who made his own accusation of sexual abuse by Groer public.
Demonstrators outside the mass Saturday carried black balloons to
signal their unhappiness with Krenn.
</P>
<P>
   Even Austrians who are not actively practicing Catholics have
followed the Groer affair and Krenn's prayer for him in St. Poelton
was mentioned on most newscasts here.
</P>
<P>
   Schoenborn, who is as conservative as the pope on doctrinal
issues, has sought to make peace within Austria's church by
engaging in dialogue with Catholic dissidents. He invited leaders
of one of the more prominent lay groups, We Are the Church, to sit
in the VIP section at Sunday's outdoor mass on Vienna's Heroes'
Square. They thanked him for the invitation but declined to attend
in protest against what they view as the pope's resistance to
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   One liberal Catholic who did attend was the Rev. Eduard Fischer,
the priest who was dismissed from his parish duties by Krenn for
publicly airing his charges against Groer. He has since came as a
reporter for the dissident Catholic newsletter Ja, or yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pope is visiting a burning house,'' Fischer complained.
``But instead of speaking about the fire, he talks about the lovely
flowers in front of it.''

 WASHINGTON: right thing.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bob was the top debater at Brooklyn Prep, and Bill was known as
something of an intellectual even then, tackling ``The Iliad'' and
``The Odyssey'' as a sixth-grader. Even then, too, friends remember
Bill as a child who was deeply interested in moral issues and such
theological debates as how unfair it would be if pets were not
allowed into heaven, official Catholic teaching notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   Then and now, Bob Bennett seemed less interested in these
matters. And politically, he has never been comfortable declaring
himself, though he has represented Democrats and Republicans,
including former Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger.
</P>
<P>
   He does suggest that he does not necessarily share the politics
of his best-known client. ``If Clinton were George Bush, I'd be
doing the same thing I am now,'' he said, smiling. ``Obviously, the
issues would be different.''
</P>
<P>
   These days Bob Bennett is working on fending off Ms. Jones'
appeal of her case and fighting efforts by the independent counsel
to get top Clinton aides to testify about the president's
relationship with Monica Lewinsky, a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett mentioned that he once represented a bookie, and saw a
certain morality even in him. ``That bookie would not give up the
book. He'd have gone to the gas chamber instead. We all choose how
we're going to be moral.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Bob Bennett says, the chief difference between the
brothers is more philosophical than ideological. ``I see the world
as a very complicated place,'' he said, and rubbed his eyes. ``I
wish the world was more like what my brother wants it to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, ``We're breaks for each other,'' Bob Bennett said,
getting a little maudlin. ``As long as the other is alive, we don't
have to worry that our family would ever want for anything if
anything ever happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite enormous material success, he clearly sees their blood
bond as a hedge against hard times. ``We're there for each other on
the important things.''
</P>
<P>
   In his own downtown office, Bill Bennett is initially more
cautious than his brother, and still shows signs of the shy child
he was, mostly avoiding eye contact.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, he said, he has had more reason to worry about his big
brother than vice versa. ``The Clintons bother me and what happens
to people around them worries me,'' Bill Bennett said. ``It's risky
business.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bennetts' politics seem to have shifted since Bob talked
Bill out of joining the anti-war Students for a Democratic Society
in college. But the cultural differences between the two are
reflected in their families. Ellen, Bob's wife, who was dressed
casually for an interview in her kitchen, said their daughters were
``pretty liberal'' and still trying to convert Uncle Bill.
</P>
<P>
   Elayne, Bill's wife, who has a warm, Southern sensibility and a
more formal bearing, served pear tart and tea and said: ''Our boys
wear a tie to school every day, Catholic school. We're afraid of
popular culture. We restrict television and monitor rock music. I
never saw `Seinfeld,' and I don't want my kids to watch `The
Simpsons.'''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bennett sees himself as a ``public advocate, a public
philosopher on some of the things out there that I believe matter
in the long run,'' he said, adding, ``I do not see myself as Mr.
Virtue.''
</P>
<P>
   He refers to his role in relation to his brother's: ``As a
parallel to Bob, who likes to defend people in trouble, I like to
defend principles that are in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   He has spent many months saying Clinton should resign if he had
an affair with Ms. Lewinsky. But only a few weeks ago, he said, he
decided to write a book about how the whole mess had lowered
America's moral standards, after reading a newspaper article about
a group of Republicans in Naperville, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were apparently sitting around saying, `What does this
matter to me?' I said, `This is ridiculous!' These are Republicans,
who should know better, taking on this pseudo-intellectual,
European, learned nonsense and it made me mad. There should be
outrage!''
</P>
<P>
   He says he is writing the book to counter the cynicism and moral
slippage that are sure to take root if the defense of Clinton's
reported bad behavior goes unanswered. Both brothers said their
relationship would survive this, too. But there are strains over
the Clintons and other matters. Bill once took offense, for
example, when Bob called him ``Mr. Virtue'' on television.
</P>
<P>
   And close as they are, there have always been topics considered
off-limits. One night years ago, when Bill Bennett was 32 and still
unmarried, the telephone rang, and it was his brother. He remembers
the conversation like this: ``He said, `Is there anything you want
to ask me about sex?' He was worried that he had not done his duty
as an older brother. It was very sweet, very guilty, very Bob. I
told him, `Thanks, I'm fine.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Bill Bennett asks an interviewer about his brother, looking
for an answer to what some people consider the ultimate personal
question: ``Does Bob believe in God?'' Well, he is not practicing,
Bill is told, but beyond that, he did not say. Suddenly, Bill
Bennett is beaming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe,'' he said, `I'll call and ask him if he has any
questions about God.''

 UNDATED: financial aid.''. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   And in an explicit offer of negotiation, Harvard added, ``We
expect that some of our admitted students will have particularly
attractive offers from the institutions with new aid programs, and
those students should not assume that we will not respond.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Keck said it was Harvard's letter that prompted her appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard's financial aid office was open 12 hours a day six days
a week in April for families to discuss their packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spoke to an unprecedented number of parents this year,''
said William Fitzsimmons, Harvard's dean of admissions.
``Competition had been getting tougher, and this year's
announcement by other institutions did nothing to abate the
competitiveness. But I think from the student's point of view, it
is a good thing. This is America. This is a market.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, say those educators worried by the trend, the changes
at Harvard and Princeton mean that middle-income families whose
children are the cream of their schools can negotiate better aid
packages at elite colleges. But the tactics are having a cascading
effect. Beyond the top colleges, there is an abandonment of the
principle of so-called ``need-blind'' admission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Need-blind'' means accepting students regardless of their
ability to pay and providing a mix of grants, loans and campus
jobs. Many institutions that a decade ago operated by such rules
say they no longer can.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two years ago we stated publicly that while we had been
need-blind in the past, we could no longer afford to do it,'' said
Michael Fraher, financial aid director at Vassar College.
</P>
<P>
   Vassar, like Carleton, Smith, Oberlin and others, have become
somewhat ``need-sensitive'' in their admissions procedures in
recent years. That means that, particularly toward the bottom of
the list of those admitted, such institutions do not promise to
meet 100 percent of applicants' needs.
</P>
<P>
   Students from lower-income groups, including members of
minorities, who are not at the top of their classes, may be
rejected because of their inability to afford the tuition, while
students of similar qualification but higher income will get in.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we look at the bottom 10 to 20 percent of the students,''
Fraher said, ``we have to ask ourselves whether we really want to
commit $18,000 of Vassar scholarship money to a certain student
when we can attract two other, perhaps better students, by granting
each half that amount.''
</P>
<P>
   The other trend that has made it difficult for less-endowed
colleges to maintain need-blind policies is the increased use of
so-called merit aid, meaning the offering of scholarships to top
students whether or not their families need the money. The authors
of ``The Student Aid Game'' say that merit aid grew at a 13 percent
annual rate (after adjusting for inflation) in the 1980s and has
apparently accelerated since. Need-based aid, as a portion of all
aid, fell by one-eighth in the 1980s, although it increased
annually by 10 percent during that period.
</P>
<P>
   Through such aid, second-tier institutions seek to lure students
who might otherwise choose a more expensive or more exclusive
school.
</P>
<P>
   The trend is also visible at some state institutions. This past
season, some state legislatures, including those of Kentucky,
Florida and Louisiana, which control state university budgets,
moved toward merit aid in an effort to keep the most promising
students in their states.
</P>
<P>
   The move toward greater use of merit scholarships, particularly
at a time of record stock portfolios, has some scholars asserting
that colleges are backing away from traditional responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``College endowments are at historically unprecedented heights,
so the number of need-blind institutions should be increasing
rather than decreasing,'' said Jerome Karabel, professor of
sociology at the University of California at Berkeley, who is
studying the question. ``Institutions of higher education need to
ask themselves whether they are moving in the wrong direction.''

WILLIAM THE CONQUERED _ HARRIED BY TEEN-AGE GIRLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By WARREN HOGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ He is a fan of pop music and fast food, an avid swimmer
and tennis player. He prefers action adventure books to novels and
even likes the swallow-tail coat, starched collar and striped
trousers he must wear at Eton.
</P>
<P>
   Sixteen years old Sunday, the winsome young man destined to be
king of England says that the only uncomfortable part of his life
is dealing with the shrieking teen-age girls who swoon at his
sight.
</P>
<P>
   With his exams at Eton finished, Prince William celebrated his
birthday Sunday out of public view with friends at an undisclosed
location and spoke to his family on the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   But aides to his father, Prince Charles, at St. James' Palace,
are seeking to balance the young man's need for privacy with the
widespread interest in him. They published a mass of details about
his adolescence culled from official records and answers he gave to
written questions from The Press Association, Britain's domestic
news agency.
</P>
<P>
   What emerged was a portrait of a youth mature beyond his age but
with the normal enthusiasms and tastes of a teen-ager intact after
a tumultuous year that forced him into a public role long before
anyone intended.
</P>
<P>
   Publication of the managed information was seen as a reward to
the British press for its adherence to Press Complaint Commission
rules made more strict to shield Prince William and his brother,
Prince Harry, after the death of their mother, Diana, princess of
Wales, in an automobile crash in Paris last Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Next in line to the throne after his father, William attracted
enormous sympathy and admiration by the dignity and fortitude of
his participation in Diana's funeral. He accepted flowers from
mourners outside Buckingham Palace with remarkable composure and
then strode solemnly behind her coffin in the procession from St.
James' Palace to Westminster Abbey.
</P>
<P>
   Under the tightened press guidelines, the two boys can be
photographed only at carefully rationed arranged occasions, usually
with their father.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of those moments, a ski trip to Vancouver, British
Columbia, last March, that alerted the palace to what a pin-up the
6-foot-1-inch prince with the shock of blond hair, blue eyes and
downward-looking shy smile so reminiscent of his mother has become
to teen-age girls. Hundreds of them gave him a weeping and
screaming rock star greeting as he playfully tried on a red
Canadian team Winter Olympics beret and grinned in embarrassment.
</P>
<P>
   In his answers to the Press Association questions, William
showed an awareness of the power of a royal endorsement, declining
to name what brand of junk food appealed to him or which rock
groups he liked, saying only that he leaned toward ``techno
music.'' He said he shops for his own clothes and the style he
favors he described only as ``modern.'' He said he does not have
his own computer but enjoys playing computer games.
</P>
<P>
   He professed to like school, a marked contrast to his father's
loathing of the ascetic Gordonstoun school in Scotland that he
attended at the same age. William plans to focus on geography,
biology and history of art, and has not decided yet what university
he will apply to. His father studied at Trinity College, Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   He said he longs to go on safari in Africa, something he missed
out on last year when his father and brother visited South Africa.
He enjoys writing letters and keeps in touch with his family by
phone. Besides tennis, sports he has excelled at include swimming,
soccer, polo, rugby and team clay-pigeon shooting.
</P>
<P>
   From the notes issued by the palace about his earlier years, it
emerges that he took part in elementary school plays, sang and was
``very brave and did not cry'' when he was accidentally hit in the
head by a golf club by a pupil when he was 9.
</P>
<P>
   At age 7 he received a school cup for being the most stylish
swimmer, a testament to the influence of his mother, who once said
that water was her ``element.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been only two breaches of the press' conduct toward
the prince, once this winter on a ski trip to Switzerland when
French paparazzi tried to take candid pictures of him on the slopes
after the ``photo opportunity,'' and this past week when The Mail
on Sunday published a birthday supplement about him that the palace
called ``grossly intrusive and completely untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials objected to passages that said that young women were
``vetted'' by his aides before they could take tea with the prince
and other parts that purported to know his inner thoughts and
feelings. The paper said its special section was meant to be a
``warm tribute'' to William, but Jonathan Holborow, the editor,
summoned to St. James' Palace, apologized for the paper's lapse and
promised strict conformity with the code of conduct in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Lord Wakeham, chairman of the newspaper watchdog Press
Complaints Commission, took the occasion to say, ``I will be
reminding the industry of the terms of its code on these matters
and of the continuing need to avoid such intrusions into his
privacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Prince William will probably be spared the kind of embarrassment
suffered by his father, who was derided by the press when he
wandered into a Highland pub near his prep school, bellied up to
the bar and ordered a cherry brandy.
</P>
<P>
   William is not expected to take up his formal royal duties until
after his graduation from college six years from now, and the press
is bound by the code of nonintrusion until then. But the Guardian
speculated this weekend that the timing might end up differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``The older he gets, the harder it will be to enforce the
code,'' it wrote. ``And when William's first girlfriend is
discovered _ as inevitably she will be _ the gentlemanly consensus
among editors may well collapse and all hell break loose.''

 By PETER WAYNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   To the companies in the smart-card business, Paul Kocher may be
too smart for their own good.
</P>
<P>
   For the last year, Kocher's four-man consulting firm in San
Francisco has kept big credit-card companies and banks on edge by
sharing details of his discovery of a way to break into the newest
version of smart cards _ credit-card size devices that contain a
tiny computer chip and can be used for a variety of purposes
including storing so-called digital cash.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kocher's intent has been to warn the industry and sell
it possible solutions, his expertise _ in the hands of thieves,
counterfeiters or impostors _ could compromise the security
safeguards of smart cards, which are coming into widespread use in
the United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The cards are at the center of the plans by the banking and
credit-card industries to cut costs and improve customer
convenience by replacing conventional magnetic-stripe cards with
ones that not only can act as a debit or automated-teller-machine
card but can also be loaded with digital cash that would function
as legal tender wherever merchants have digital-cash decoder
terminals.
</P>
<P>
   Public confidence in the technology will be crucial to the
industry's plans. And that may help explain why, since word leaked
of Kocher's break-in methods two weeks ago, the industries
promoting smart cards have tended to play down his technique by
calling it a ``laboratory attack'' that could be replicated by
perhaps a handful of people around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chip cards are the most secure technology around,'' said Steve
Schapp, the executive vice president of Visa International in
charge of developing smart cards. ``They are very hard to break.''
</P>
<P>
   Kocher and his colleagues were able to crack the digital code
designed to make the smart cards tamperproof by drawing
mathematical inferences from the fluctuating electrical power
consumption of the chip.
</P>
<P>
   It is a sophisticated type of analysis, but the rudimentary
``laboratory'' _ in this case a three-room office suite, some
garden-variety PCs and several thousand dollars of electronics
equipment _ indicates that it does not require elaborate tools to
crack what is supposed to be a highly secure digital safe.
</P>
<P>
   As details of the technique circulate, as they invariably do in
the hacker underground, imitators will almost certainly try to
duplicate Kocher's experiment. For his part, Kocher, who at 25 is
already a well-known expert in code breaking, said, ``As the
expertise becomes more widely available, the threats will become
more than academic.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Neumann, a computer scientist at SRI International, a
research group in Menlo Park, Calif., said the approach had
``enormous potential as another technique for breaking weakly
designed and badly implemented devices.''
</P>
<P>
   Though already in wide use as bank cards in Europe, smart cards
in the United States have been mainly used so far for controlling
access to buildings and protecting against fraudulent use of new
types of cellular telephones. But U.S. banks have begun
experimenting with the cards, as Chase Manhattan is doing in a test
of Mastercard International's Mondex system on the Upper West Side
of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Banks trust that the computer chips embedded in tamper-resistant
packaging will act like a virtual branch office, dispensing money
and crediting accounts to the right people. But if someone could
break through the card's defense, then that person could conduct
fraudulent transactions, load counterfeit digital cash onto the
cards or create various other forms of mischief.
</P>
<P>
   So even as smart-card executives seek to play down the threat
posed by Kocher's discovery, and they stress that no known
break-ins of his sort have occurred in the real world, the industry
knows it must continuously improve smart-card software and
hardware.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense, this is an arms race; the attackers will always
get better,'' said Richard Fletcher, the head of strategy and
planning of Mastercard's Mondex smart-card division. ``The only
defense and the best defense against future attacks is to keep
moving and keep changing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gerald Hubbard is the vice president of marketing in the United
States for Bull Smart Cards, a company that says it has shipped
more than 120 million money-carrying smart cards throughout the
world. He said that his company had known about the Kocher type of
attack for more than four years and had installed safeguards to
thwart it. But, Hubbard said, ``You can never say a card is 100
percent immune.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some other industry executives expect it to take
perhaps two years before there will be smart cards and related
hardware that will be impervious to Kocher's type of attack.
</P>
<P>
   Kocher said he had approached the smart-card industry last year
with the details of his discovery because he knew that criminals
might also use the same tricks. But he said that he did not
publicize his findings, so that the industry would have time to
adopt defenses, including techniques for which he has filed for
patents and which he is now licensing to the companies.
</P>
<P>
   He publicly announced the smart-card security flaw two weeks
ago, only after The Australian Financial Review published an
article about his break-in technique.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Kocher's company, Cryptography Research, analyzes and tests
computer-security hardware and software for many of the leading
computer companies. His discoveries of flaws in supposedly secure
technologies have drawn attention in the past _ as in 1995, when he
found that he could break into smart cards by simply timing how
long it took them to process data.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of this newly disclosed smart-card problem, Kocher
and his colleagues found that the cards' consumption of electrical
power could disclose vital information about the secret key that
protects the money or other data on the chip.
</P>
<P>
   By watching the monitor of an oscilloscope, a device that
measures the power use on a screen similar to the way a cardiac
monitor displays a patient's heart action, Kocher's team was able
in some cases to use the electrical pattern from a single
transaction to decipher the key to the code. In other cases, they
were forced to use more sophisticated statistical techniques to
analyze the results from as many as 1,000 transactions.
</P>
<P>
   Kocher said his team had spent at least as much time looking for
solutions as it had in identifying the security flaw. A possible
remedy involves masking the transaction in digital noise by adding
meaningless random calculations that would consume random amounts
of current.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible solution, which according to Mastercard
officials is being incorporated in the latest version of its Mondex
smart-card software, is to vary the order of the operations in the
software to make it more difficult to identify patterns in the
consumption of power.
</P>
<P>
   A banking-industry goal with smart cards is to cut costs by
eliminating the need for central approval of a debit or credit
transaction. By some estimates, the marginal costs for clearing a
smart-card transaction are well under a penny. Credit-card
transactions, however, typically require a long-distance computer
network and a large central database for examining each deal, and
the transaction eventually means billing a customer and cashing the
payment checks.
</P>
<P>
   These steps add up to 25 cents a transaction, on average,
compared with about a penny for a smart-card transaction, in which
all the authorization information _ and even the money itself _ can
be contained on the card's chip.
</P>
<P>
   To create an audit trail that might help track fraud, however,
Visa International's smart-card system uses merchant terminals that
report transactions to a central data base at the end of each day.
``We don't feel it is a good idea to have the security depend upon
the chip itself,'' said Philip Yen, a senior vice president of Visa
International. ``We think it's more important to have complete
system security.''
</P>
<P>
   Fletcher, of Mastercard's Mondex, contends that including any
sort of central control runs counter to the purpose of a smart card
_ giving customers the ability to use the money on a card just like
cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``The critical point of any digital cash system is that you're
off line,'' he said. ``There's no online link at that point. You're
critically dependent upon the card's security.''
</P>
<P>
   As the banks debate the security trade-offs, there is one
certainty: Paul Kocher and others like him will continue to look
for chinks in the smart-card armor. And as Kocher likes to remind
the industry, ``We have not yet encountered a card that couldn't be
broken.''

FRENCH RIOT POLICE PREPARE FOR ENGLISH FANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOULOUSE, France _ It was hot here Sunday. Steve Skelton, an
English soccer fan, planted himself squarely beneath the midday
sun, swigged a beer and, as a brass band played ``Rule Britannia''
on the main square, gave vent to his satisfaction. ``All this,'' he
said, ``makes you puff out your chest with pride''.
</P>
<P>
   Skelton, a builder, puffed on a cigarette; his chest was sweaty;
``Britannia rules the waves'' echoed across the square. Sheer
paradise.
</P>
<P>
   England's mad dogs, hot in pursuit of sun, beer, soccer and
nationalist catharsis _ in roughly that order _ have moved on from
Marseilles, where three nights of violence left dozens injured and
more than 100 fans in jail. Arriving in this other southern city,
they have found what police describe as a ``psychosis'' about the
English hooligans.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,500 riot police have been deployed ahead of Monday's
World Cup soccer match between England and Romania. Bars have been
ordered to close at midnight. Open-air concerts have been called
off.
</P>
<P>
   A display of medieval jousting has been canceled because city
authorities think it may give people ideas. Worst of all, for the
many ticketless supporters, giant screens that were to have shown
the game have been taken down. So much for Toulouse's ``festival of
football,'' the repetitive slogan of the French soccer authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course there's no smoke without fire, but it's ridiculous
to treat us all as hooligans because of a handful of idiots,'' said
Andrew Powell, a young man from Ipswich. ``I don't have a ticket
and I'd planned to watch the match on a screen, so I'm paying for
what a few thugs did.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the measures looked draconian on Sunday. Even an
English mascot, a man dressed up as a lion, looked docile enough,
padding around central Toulouse with all the menace of a poodle.
The main ambition of most fans seemed to be to burn as red as
possible as fast as possible while singing as out of tune as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   But English fans, particularly what British police call the
``category Cs,'' or hardcore hooligans, have tended to earn their
reputation. The word ``Heysel,'' the Brussels stadium where 85
mainly Italian fans died in 1985 after being charged by Liverpool
supporters, has become synonymous with a jingoistic, insular,
racist and beer-soaked barbarism to which a small fringe of English
supporters has shown a repetitive attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as England's game against Tunisia in Marseilles
showed, the south of France is combustible territory.
</P>
<P>
   There is the sun, of course, particularly scorching when
combined with alcohol. There is high unemployment, especially among
North African immigrants and their children. There is strong
support for the xenophobic National Front party. And now there is
the spark of soccer, at once religion, ritual, and, for some,
surrogate war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reaction here may be a little psychotic,'' said Christian
Reverbel, a police officer on duty outside the 17th-century city
hall, as chants of ``England, England'' rose from the surrounding
cafes. ``For now, there has been no trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Reverbel continued: ``But we are working with English police and
we know there are perhaps 400 hooligans among at least 10,000
English fans. One thing we worry about is that North Africans may
come in from the poor suburb of Le Mirail and provoke them.''
</P>
<P>
   Police reports now suggest that there was indeed some
provocation of the English in Marseilles from the large population
there of Tunisian or North African descent. As the arrest Sunday of
dozens of German fans in Lens showed, the English are by no means
alone. It is sometimes hard to know where soccer thuggery meets
plain vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   At the ``Le Mechoui'' restaurant in central Toulouse, Amale
Merkouboui worked Sunday behind smashed windows. She said thieves
had broken in Saturday night and stolen cash. ``I don't know if it
was locals or the English or other foreigners,'' she said, ``but
it's clear the World Cup provides good cover for this kind of
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The tournament also leaves plenty of room for good old-fashioned
bigotry. Soccer, it was once said, is not a life-and-death matter;
it is much more important that that. Never mind Romania, several
English fans said Sunday. Just wait for the old rivals _ Argentina
or Germany _ and then the real action will start.

<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ After just a couple dramatic soccer goals, one of
the most restrictive countries on earth could not be restrained.
</P>
<P>
   Throngs of Iranians _ millions by some unofficial estimates _
took to the streets and clogged them at 1:30 a.m., blowing horns,
dancing and chanting immediately after their national team's 2-1
defeat of the United States in the World Cup soccer tournament in
Lyon, France.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game is not important. The happiness is important,''
screamed computer programmer Amisadik Amani, 23. ``We do not have
these events in our country.''
</P>
<P>
   At 3:30 a.m. in Tehran, a city where it is usually difficult to
find a restaurant open after midnight, car horns were still
blaring.
</P>
<P>
   Some people were seen shedding tears of joy. Others waved Iran's
green-red-and white flags.
</P>
<P>
   The fever over the game illustrated the extremes of Iran's
culture in flux, where women can still be arrested unless they
cover their hair with scarves, where alcohol is prohibited and
where the national image centers on its mantle as a country for the
persecuted downtrodden.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, at a community center in an upscale north Tehran
neighborhood, about 80 fans became irate when police entered and
shut off the televised game broadcast that was taking place on a
big screen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is prohibited. You all have to go home,'' they announced.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers of the showing, after ten minutes of soccer action
had been missed, convinced the police to let the broadcast
continue. They then flashed lights on and off as they implored the
crowd to hush whenever cheering got loud, warning that the police
could return any minute.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after the victory, however, smiling police leaned on
their cars cross-armed, watching youths climb tall street lights in
celebration. Thousands of police had been deployed across the city,
but there were no immediate reports that any interfered with the
celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   Vanak Square, one of the city's landscaped roundabouts, was
packed with thousands of revelers.
</P>
<P>
   Iranians chanted ``Iran'' and ``We hammered USA'' even as they
said they hoped the game could produce better relations with a
country they are convinced is trying to undermine their Islamic
society.
</P>
<P>
   They have closely followed the cautious offers of dialogue that
their new moderate President Mohammad Khatami has exchanged with
President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In a message to the Iranian team broadcast at the end of the
game, Iran's hard-line spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei,
said: ``Tonight again, the strong and arrogant opponent felt the
bitter taste of defeat at your hands. Be happy that you have made
the Iranian nation happy.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though there are fewer Iranians chanting ``Death to
America'' at prayer days, a win over the U.S. was sweet.
</P>
<P>
   Small signs were affixed to police cars, stating: ``The U.S.
curse was broken.''
</P>
<P>
   One woman, pressing the limits by joining a spontaneous all-male
parade, shouted her thanks to the bemused _ and for once not feared
_ police.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very important. We showed our power to the United
States,'' said Malek Rad, a 50-year-old housewife, after she
stepped from the parade.
</P>
<P>
   But generally, the jubilation was more about a love for soccer
and a needed emotional release in what can be a sterile society.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all going crazy. We can express ourselves and no one can
stop us,'' said her son, Sayed Khayam, a 33-year-old teacher.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-fought first round battle in Lyon was more than just a
confrontation between two global foes. Rather, the victory provided
a chance for Iranians to celebrate a slow emergence from world
isolation and to test freedoms cautiously advocated by a
charismatic new president.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Sunday, a the second day of the work week here, many
Iranians were disappointed to see their hard-line parliament
impeach one of the key reformers in the cabinet of President
Khatami. It was the latest maneuver in the struggle between the
country's conservative and moderate factions.
</P>
<P>
   But, the Iranian soccer team, the first to make the World Cup
since the Islamic revolution in 1979, won the day with its triumph.
</P>
<P>
   The street celebrations were the third in just over a year _
others were held when the team qualified for the tournament and
after the election of Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   The night began calmly. Traffic was heavy as people prepared for
the game and it seemed that boys were playing soccer in makeshift
goals on nearly every vacant lot or alley.
</P>
<P>
   Though police did not take a high-profile on the street, they
had kept most community centers from showing the game and most
watched it at home.
</P>
<P>
   At the north Tehran center where the game was shown, those
attending were not permitted to carry cameras to record the
gathering, apparently to discourage excessive celebration in the
event of a victory.

isolation and to test freedoms cautiously advocated by a
charismatic new president.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Sunday, a the second day of the work week here, many
Iranians were disappointed to see their hard-line parliament
impeach one of the key reformers in the cabinet of President
Khatami. It was the latest maneuver in the struggle between the
country's conservative and moderate factions.
</P>
<P>
   But, the Iranian soccer team, the first to make the World Cup
since the Islamic revolution in 1979, won the day with its triumph.
</P>
<P>
   The street celebrations were the third in just over a year _
others were held when the team qualified for the tournament and
after the election of Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   The night began calmly. Traffic was heavy as people prepared for
the game and it seemed that boys were playing soccer in makeshift
goals on nearly every vacant lot or alley.
</P>
<P>
   Though police did not take a high-profile on the street, they
had kept most community centers from showing the game and most
watched it at home.
</P>
<P>
   At the north Tehran center where the game was shown, those
attending were not permitted to carry cameras to record the
gathering, apparently to discourage excessive celebration in the
event of a victory.

LEWINSKY'S NEW LAWYERS REACH OLD STANDOFF IN STARR TALKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID E. SANGER   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Five months after investigators began exploring
allegations of a sexual relationship between President Clinton and
Monica Lewinsky, new lawyers for the former White House intern have
returned to the same standoff with independent counsel Kenneth
Starr that her previous attorneys confronted.
</P>
<P>
   Details of the negotiations between Starr and Ms. Lewinsky's
legal team, which appeared Sunday in The Washington Post and were
confirmed by people with knowledge of the investigation, suggest
the two sides are still far from an agreement that would lead to
her testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Starr still insists that Ms. Lewinsky agree to plead guilty to
some offense relating to an affidavit she submitted in the sexual
harassment suit brought by Paula Jones against Clinton. That suit
has since been dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's new lawyers, Plato Cacheris and Jacob Stein,
longtime members of Washington's circle of elite attorneys, insist
on complete immunity for Ms. Lewinsky in exchange for testimony
that she had sex with Clinton. This deal is exactly what her
previous lawyer, William Ginsburg, had sought from Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiating distance between Starr and Ms. Lewinsky's new
lawyers is likely to give some solace to Clinton and his legal team
at the White House. While White House officials were being careful
Sunday to say nothing in public about these newest indications that
Starr is still a long way from a deal with Ms. Lewinsky, they made
no secret of the fact that they were pleased.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have pithy comments to make but no facts,'' one member
of Clinton's camp said. ``It appears to us that most of the
cheering for a deal came from a press corps that is eager to move
this story along.''
</P>
<P>
   A person with knowledge of the strategy of Ms. Lewinsky's
defense team said the major uncertainty concerns what evidence
Starr may have collected in months of grand jury testimony, which
continues this week.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has been trying to find holes in Ms. Lewinsky's affidavit,
and may be able to establish that she failed to mention some
meetings with the president. He is especially concerned with
meetings that may have taken place as the Jones case gained
attention around Christmas, just ahead of the long Saturday
afternoon in which Clinton was himself deposed in the case.
</P>
<P>
   For the deposition, lawyers for Ms. Jones asked the president at
length about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky _ which
subsequently prompted the president to call in his secretary, Betty
Currie, and lead her through a conversation about her own memories.
Ms. Currie was Ms. Lewinsky's main conduit as she tried to reach
the president and send him gifts and a tape.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky may be seeking to strike a deal in which she admits
to having had a sexual relationship with the president, but denies
that there was any effort by the White House to alter her
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   That would leave the president with a major political
embarrassment, a public contradiction of his statement five months
ago that he ``did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss
Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   But on Capitol Hill, both Republicans and Democrats have said
that an allegation of an affair, without related charges of perjury
or of an effort to alter testimony, is unlikely to lead to
impeachment charges.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, additional descriptions of some of the key evidence in
the case _ 20 hours of secretly tape-recorded conversations in
which Ms. Lewinsky describes the nature of her relationship with
the president _ suggest that Starr may have difficulty proving that
Clinton or his friend Vernon Jordan sought to influence Ms.
Lewinsky's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The latest issue of U.S. News &AMP; World Report describes two hours
of previously undescribed recordings and says they contain no
reference to any effort by Clinton or Jordan to have Ms. Lewinsky
lie about her relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes are described by the magazine as bolstering the view
that Ms. Lewinsky was infatuated with the president but had been
cut off from access to him by autumn of last year.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's allies have long asserted that they expected the
revelation of further material from the tapes secretly made by
Linda Tripp, a former colleague of Ms. Lewinsky's at the Pentagon,
to be exculpatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first excerpts released were probably the worst,'' one
person familiar with the White House's strategy in the case said
recently. Clinton's allies repeated that assertion Sunday, after
hearing of the U.S. News account. However, roughly 16 hours of the
tapes have still not been described publicly.

DUVA GETS HIS JUST DUE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Ring magazine had tongue in cheek when it
declared that Lou Duva has ``the most recognizable profile since
Hitchcock.''
</P>
<P>
   That might not be far off, at least in the boxing world: Duva,
76, seems to be everywhere doing everything even though most of his
peers are long retired.
</P>
<P>
   In a career that has spanned more than a half-century, he has
fought, trained, managed and promoted. And he's done it
successfully _ he's worked in some capacity with dozens of
champions _ and in a colorful manner all his own.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he joined the ranks of the greats in the sport: He
was elected to the International Boxing Hall of Fame.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought about the Hall of Fame,'' Duva said a day
after his induction. ``When I thought of the Hall of Fame, I
thought of the old guys, Ray Arcel, Charlie Goldman. Those kind of
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``... This is like a gold medal in the Olympics: They can't take
it away.''
</P>
<P>
   Duva earned his place in history.
</P>
<P>
   The son of Italian immigrants grew up in poverty in Paterson,
N.J., about 10 miles outside New York City. Between myriad jobs and
school, he had already begun fighting at around 12 years old in
back rooms of restaurants and bars and had a short, undistinguished
professional career. However, his niche was outside the ring.
</P>
<P>
   At 16, after driving a truck all day to help make ends meet at
home, he would spend every free evening at Stillman's Gym in New
York. There, he would watch some of the world's best fighters work
out but pay particular attention to the trainers and schmooze with
the managers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stillman's was where I got my real introduction to boxing,''
he said. ``I used to watch the great trainers handle their
fighters, guys like Ray Arcel, Whitey Bimstein, Mannie Seamon,
Chickie Ferrara, Freddie Brown, the Florio brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned the boxing business from the ground up. (Rival
promoters Don) King and (Bob) Arum can't say that.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1963, Duva made his first significant mark: Joey Giardello
became the first of 13 world champions Duva would train.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, he has worked with such title holders as Evander
Holyfield and Pernell Whitaker and currently handles rising star
Fernando Vargas of Oxnard.
</P>
<P>
   His family's promotional firm, Main Events, also is one of the
most successful boxing enterprises in the world. The family's first
big break was acquiring a piece of Leon Spinks in 1978 _ the year
he beat and then lost to Muhammad Ali _ and promoted the first Ray
Leonard-Thomas Hearns fight in 1981. It has been a major player
since.
</P>
<P>
   Duva has been particularly successful in signing and cultivating
U.S. Olympians. Main Events landed four gold-medal winners _
Whitaker, Mark Breland, Meldrick Taylor and Tyrell Biggs _ and
Holyfield from the 1984 team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent $2.95 to get Evander,'' Duva said. ``During the
(pre-Olympic) boxoffs, I just said, `C'mon, I'll take you out to
breakfast.' That's when he said, `I'm going with him.'''
</P>
<P>
   Duva has had his share of sadness along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Most significant, he lost three people very dear to him: Former
heavyweight champion Rocky Marciano, his close friend, was killed
in a plane crash in 1969; his wife, Enes, died of multiple
sclerosis in 1986; and his son Dan died of brain cancer in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   However, he has remained an always-positive, high-energy,
laugh-a-minute person who is a delight to be around.
</P>
<P>
   He loves to tell stories and people love to listen, whether the
tales are true or fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   There's the one about how he received from Mexico a ``new''
substance to stop bleeding and used it when one of his fighters was
cut in the mouth. He later found out it was made with Crazy Glue.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the next eight rounds, I couldn't open his mouth to get
his mouthpiece out,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And there are the more poignant stories, such as when Holyfield
knocked out Buster Douglas to win the heavyweight title _ his
greatest moment in boxing.
</P>
<P>
   He had always told himself that if one of his fighters ever won
the heavyweight title, he'd dedicate it to Marciano.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you watch the fight, you'll see me pointing to the sky. I
was saying, `Rocky, this is for you. Rocky, this is for you.'''
</P>
<P>
   And Duva's stories and humor aren't reserved for a select few:
He seems to have time for anyone and everyone in spite of his
hectic schedule.
</P>
<P>
   He's no softy.
</P>
<P>
   He won't hold back when he has something to say. For example, he
doesn't think Oscar De La Hoya is as good as many believe and says
it openly.
</P>
<P>
   And he remains a tough guy who won't back down from a scrap in
spite of a heart attack in 1979. In the melee that followed the
Riddick Bowe-Andrew Golota fight in July of 1996, Duva was in the
middle of the fray and ended up in the hospital after slumping to
the canvas.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Duva is a people person if there ever was one. He loves
people and they love him, a key to his success.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows this more than his fighters, to whom he's
passionately devoted. So many have become part of the Main Events
and Duva family.
</P>
<P>
   Duva said he doesn't necessarily want to be remembered as one of
the sport's all-time greats, only as a manager who ``fought like
hell for my fighters.'' It appears he'll get his wish.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always there for you, always looking out for you,''
Vargas said. ``Lou is a special guy, he really is.''
</P>
<P>
   Mismatch?: Rafael Ruelas will be a significant underdog when he
faces Kostya Tszyu in a title-elimination bout on Aug. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Many observers have rolled their eyes at the prospect of the
matchup. Prevailing wisdom says Ruelas, with 55 fights, has
deteriorated as a fighter and couldn't possibly contend with
Tszyu's skill and power.
</P>
<P>
   What's the reaction of Tom Brown, matchmaker for America
Presents? ``They're out of their mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, if anyone can pull a surprise under these daunting
circumstances, it's Ruelas, who rose from two knockdowns to beat
Freddie Pendleton and win the IBF lightweight title in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   No one has ever questioned his heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just makes me work that much harder,'' Ruelas said of his
doubters. ``It gives me inspiration, to prove that they're wrong in
their thinking.'' &QL;

A MUSIC CHANNEL FOR BABY BOOMERS WITH MORTGAGES

 By BILL CARTER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When John Sykes took over as president of the cable channel VH1
in 1994, he had a theory:
</P>
<P>
   ``All the baby boomers, and all those people who started out
watching MTV in 1980, did not stop listening to music. They grew up
and bought new stereos and put CD players in their cars, and they
were spending $100 on a weekend to see the Eagles reunion concert.
But nobody on television was serving that audience.''
</P>
<P>
   That included VH1, which was originally devised to fill that
mission but instead had scraped by for more than a decade as what
Sykes called ``the bastard stepchild of MTV.''
</P>
<P>
   VH1, which is owned by MTV Networks, a unit of Viacom Inc., had
established almost no identity with television viewers; its
programming was a bizarre mix of oldie videos (``a lot of Julio
Iglesias,'' Sykes said), dusty sitcom reruns (``WKRP in
Cincinnati'') and fruit-smashing stand-up comedy acts (endless
episodes of ``Gallagher'').
</P>
<P>
   The channel started in 1985 with the purpose of staving off
competition for MTV. That year, Ted Turner had started a competing
music channel, so MTV Networks offered VH1 free to cable operators,
killing off the threat. But the channel's identity as a separate
music network was never firmly established.
</P>
<P>
   In the four years since Sykes took over, VH1 has found a formula
that has significantly increased its ratings and driven up profits.
Indeed, VH1 has the highest concentration of advertisers' most
desirable viewers, those 18 to 49. As a result, advertisers from
American Express to Lexus have added VH1 to their buying plans.
</P>
<P>
   As a sign of VH1's success, an array of musicians, from Mariah
Carey to the Rolling Stones, have appeared on the channel in live
concerts. And it even did a show called ``Bill Clinton, Rock and
Roll President,'' and now claims the nation's First Television
Viewer as a regular supporter and fan.
</P>
<P>
   The formula that turned VH1 around was basic: pure music and
music-related programs for adults. As Sykes put it, ``What I
figured we could do was own music'' for adults, ``because that was
something we could do better than anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   The pure-music format still means videos but with a different
edge: newer artists like Jewel, Paula Cole and Sarah McLachlan who
are favored more by adults than by teen-agers and innovative
formats like ``Pop-Up Video,'' which brought computer-style
information bites to the video genre.
</P>
<P>
   It also means documentary-style programs on the background of
music artists and their work, highlighted by the channel's most
popular series, ``Behind the Music,'' which examines the personal
stories of recording stars and their albums; ``Storyteller,'' which
describes how hit songs came to be written, and ``Legends,''
profiles of recording stars.
</P>
<P>
   The channel also loaded up on concerts and other events, like
its annual fashion awards. It attracted its biggest audience ever
in April with its ``Divas Live'' concert featuring six star female
performers: Mariah Carey, Celine Dion, Gloria Estefan, Aretha
Franklin, Carole King and Shania Twain.
</P>
<P>
   An even better measure of the channel's surging growth is
offered by Tom Freston, the chairman of MTV Networks, who sees VH1
as the hottest channel in his company's portfolio. ``It is growing
faster on a percentage basis than either Nickelodeon or MTV,''
Freston said. ``It's almost the sky's the limit now for VH1.''
</P>
<P>
   Such an assessment is a stark reversal from the channel's
prospects only about 18 months ago, when things were so rocky for
VH1 that it was being kicked off numerous cable systems to make
room for other channels. ``They were at a low ebb,'' said Bill
Marchetti, an analyst with Paul Kagan Associates, a firm that
analyzes the cable industry. ``If they didn't make a lot of right
moves right then, they were going to start having a tough time
getting renewals from some cable systems.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the United States' largest cable operator,
Tele-Communications Inc., had already dumped VH1 from more than one
million homes to accommodate several channels in which it owned a
financial interest, including Fox News, Animal Planet and Home and
Garden. Fortunately, Sykes said, VH1, with its new adult-music
format, had managed to build up some loyal fans by then, both in
the television audience and in the music industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We held a protest in Denver,'' Sykes said, ``with people like
John Mellencamp, Jewel and Don Henley. These artists said, `We need
a place to get our music heard.'''
</P>
<P>
   The outcry from viewers and artists eventually got VH1 back on
all the systems that dropped it, and many more besides. In the last
three years, the channel has spent $20 million in programming
improvements and extended its subscriber base to more than 62
million homes from 49 million. ``That was the turning point,''
Sykes said. Freston said if those first moves to drop VH1 from
cable systems had not been overturned, ``The whole asset value of
the channel could have vaporized.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that asset value is highly prized by MTV Networks because
VH1 has an almost ideal business plan. ``It's a niche business,''
Sykes said. Ratings are still modest. The prime-time average has
more than doubled in the last two years, but that means a rise to
only a 0.4 rating from 0.18. (For VH1, each rating point represents
620,000 homes. MTV averages about a 0.7 rating, but in a larger
number of homes.)
</P>
<P>
   ``But in the cable world,'' Sykes said, ``with our low overhead,
moderate program costs and economies of scale, you can be in a
business like music for television viewers. You can superserve that
audience and make money.''
</P>
<P>
   And VH1 is making money. In fact, Sykes confidently notes, ``We
alone are making more in profits than any broadcast network except
NBC.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason this somewhat startling development can be true is
that neither CBS, ABC nor Fox earned much money _ if any _ this
year. So the $42.5 million in profit for VH1 for 1998, as estimated
by Paul Kagan Associates, looks good by comparison. The results for
MTV shows the potential for a cable channel, with the channel
making about $250 million during the same period.
</P>
<P>
   But VH1 is looking good by comparison in several areas,
including its overall appeal to viewers between 18 and 49, the
favorite group of most advertisers. According to Nielsen Media
research, VH1 has the highest concentration of those viewers _
about 88 percent of its viewers fall in that range _ in all of
cable.
</P>
<P>
   Sykes sees VH1's growing success as confirmation of his theory
about how the generation of music fans who grew up in the 1960s and
'70s refused to relinquish their proprietary interest in music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our parents more or less gave up their dominance of the
record-buying business when they got into having children and
mortgages,'' Sykes said. ``But for the baby-boom generation, there
has always been a passionate connection to music.''
</P>
<P>
   Sykes, who began his career as an MTV executive in the 1980s,
left in 1986 to take various positions in the music industry. From
that perspective he noticed a change going on. ``There had always
been a perception in the music industry that adults didn't
matter,'' he said. ``But I noticed that adults were buying more
records than their kids. And they had Visa cards to use, not their
allowances.''
</P>
<P>
   But the adult audience was not going to watch MTV. In Freston's
words, ``They couldn't stand the music on MTV,'' with its mix of
rap, alternative and hard rock. Once VH1 responded to adults'
continuing passion for music, Sykes said, it was on its way. ``The
adult audience today almost feels elitist toward music,'' he said.
``It feels like it has always had the best music, the music
influenced by the war in Vietnam, the music that established
trends. And now, probably for the first time in history, we're
seeing music cross over from adults to kids.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton fits the description of a baby boomer with a
continuing passion for music, Sykes said. He has several personal
letters from the president attesting to his interest in the
channel's programming. (The president was especially taken by a
series of specials VH1 did on the 20th anniversary of the death of
Elvis Presley, Sykes said.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also enthusiastically supported the channel's campaign
called ``Save the Music,'' which raises money for school music
programs, partly through donations of old instruments. Clinton
donated an old saxophone, which went to an inner-city Washington
high school.
</P>
<P>
   Having moved in the last three years to what he called
``second-tier status'' among cable channels, Sykes said, the next
step is ``to jump up to the first tier.'' He defined the second
tier as channels like Comedy Central and Lifetime, which have more
than 50 million homes and climbing ratings. The top tier, he said,
are the dominant channels of cable, like ESPN, CNN and MTV, with 65
million to 73 million homes and regular programs with strong
support.
</P>
<P>
   ``The upside for us is getting to where MTV and Nickelodeon are
in the next few years,'' Sykes said. ``We're at a different point
in our lifeline. We've been around since 1985, but for most of
those years we were doing nothing. We're sort of where MTV was in
the early 1980s. The real upside is creating the kind of brand
awareness that MTV and Nick have now.''

   MARONDERA, Zimbabwe _ ``Be very careful, please,'' said Richard
Magorimbo Madzorera, crouching low to slip through the sharp, rusty
fence without touching it. ``We don't want to damage the farmer's
wire.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though their rotted shoes are falling off them and they are
living on dried corn and pumpkin leaves they carry 12 miles from
home, the black squatters on Daskop Farm are being extraordinarily
careful of the white owner's property. They want the farm _ they
say it is their ancestral land, and can even point out a stone they
say their great-great-grandmothers ground corn on. But right now
they are not willing even to walk across one of his fallow fields.
</P>
<P>
   In the endless war over land that began when whites seized the
country 120 years ago and led to government promises in recent
years to redistribute the land to poor farmers, a new front opened
this week. Hundreds of subsistence farmers from 20 villages in the
Svosve communal area left the stony hills their families had been
pushed into and moved onto three farms in the Marondera area.
</P>
<P>
   They say the Zimbabwe government's land program is going too
slowly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to take the first move,'' said Conald Shoniwa, 42.
``We were not prepared to die from hunger.''
</P>
<P>
   Svosve's depleted soil is so thin that ``we dodge the stones
like monkeys,'' said Modesto Murambatsvina, 36. Carrying babies,
hoes, food and blankets, they left their school-age children and
hiked here. They came now, they said, so as not to miss spring
planting, which begins by August.
</P>
<P>
   Whites in Zimbabwe, less than 2 percent of the population, own
70 percent of the land, and for 17 years after independence, the
government dithered, making unfulfilled promises about land reform.
Then, last year, with the embattled President Robert Mugabe
declaring ``the time has come,'' it suddenly published a list of
1,503 farms _ half the country's export-producing acreage _ that it
said it intended to seize without payment.
</P>
<P>
   An international outcry ensued, the currency plummeted and
farmers asserted that Cabinet ministers were plotting to steal
their best farms for retirement villas.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, things have calmed down. The government, farmers and
international donors are talking. About 200 farms available for
sale were found, said David Hasluck, executive director of the
largely white Commercial Farmers Union, and about $800 million in
grants and loans from donors and banks has been offered on the
conditions that the land is paid for, that it goes to poor people
and that they are settled, not just dumped.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, not a single farm has been bought, or even assessed,
Hasluck said. ``Time is short, and the government doesn't have
focus.''
</P>
<P>
   For the people of Svosve, time ran out. They said they picked
Daskop, Homepark and Igava farms from the government's list, and
are asking for parts that are not being used.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to displace the farmer,'' said Frederick
Hwenjere, 30. ``We want to share equally with him.''
</P>
<P>
   Daskop is an obviously well-run farm with a big irrigation pond,
a husking plant, fields of seed corn growing under plastic tents
and cattle fattening on watered grass. The squatters are living on
a distant corner, keeping to themselves. There has been no trouble,
said Shaun David, the farm manager, and he's been told by the owner
to leave the squatters alone.
</P>
<P>
   Igava Farm next door had been listed for seizure, Hasluck said,
and was then offered for sale to the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the best in the area,'' he said, with huts, a
clinic, a school and a butchery, all built for its workers, on the
land. It was offered, he said, because the owners _ the same
extended family owns several farms in the area _ knew the Svosve
ancestral graves were on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want to go up against people on tradition like
that,'' Hasluck said.
</P>
<P>
   The owners said they would use the sale proceeds to build new
housing and schools on their remaining farms, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what the government will do is not known yet.
</P>
<P>
   (On Sunday night, state television reported that the minister of
land thought he had convinced the squatters to go home until the
government can resettle them at its own pace.)
</P>
<P>
   The squatters say the government has broken simple promises,
like handouts of seed corn, and among their leaders are veterans of
the 1980s war against white rule, whose association has recently
become so militant that it clashed with its former commander,
Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
   If the squatters refuse to leave, the police may be asked to
move them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think we can retreat,'' said Abraham Mpunga, 30. ``We
can't leave this place.''

CONSULTANTS BLAME MEDIA FOR POLITICIANS' WOES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   As politicians moan about interminable fund-raising demands to
pay for brutal attack commercials, consultants who run many of
their campaigns and make many of the advertisements say it is not
their fault, and they suggest that if anyone is to blame for public
despair about the system, it is the news media.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of more than 200 political consultants made public
Wednesday by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press
and the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at
American University found that the consultants were driven more by
the thrill of the competition than by ideology. And, by an
overwhelming proportion, they believed that focusing on an
opponent's weaknesses was perfectly acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   The survey offered a rare glimpse into the minds of political
consultants, who play enormous roles in packaging candidates and
preparing them to run for office but usually are overshadowed by
the politicians for whom they work. This is the first time that so
many leading consultants _ most have been involved in major races
over the last three election seasons _ have been interviewed for
one survey.
</P>
<P>
   While more than half of those surveyed blamed the media for
discouraging people from running for office because news
organizations dwell too much on the personal lives of candidates,
many consultants made clear that they were not particularly
impressed by their own candidates. Most consultants emphasized the
importance of their own roles and also criticized the public as
poorly informed and lacking sound judgment about issues.
</P>
<P>
   James Thurber, director of the Center for Congressional and
Presidential Studies, said he was struck by the degree to which
consultants refused to take responsibility for public
disillusionment with the political process.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know something's wrong,'' Thurber said. ``And they have
to point their finger at some institution. So instead of pointing
at themselves, they point at the media, the candidates and the
electorate.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying that the findings raised serious questions about what
motivates consultants, he asserted, ``They're in the business of
electing people _ and not in the business of trying to improve
governance.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 percent of the respondents said it was relatively
easy to sell a ``mediocre candidate'' to the voters. Roughly the
same proportion said they had helped elect candidates whom they
were eventually sorry to see serve in office. And 48 percent rated
their congressional candidates as fair or poor.
</P>
<P>
   The consultants seemed to play down the importance of the
candidates' political skills. Asked for the most important factor
in winning an election, the candidate's campaign ability ranked
fourth after quality of the message, amount of money available and
the partisan makeup of the state or House district.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most striking findings were the differences in
attitudes and perspectives among Republican consultants and their
Democratic counterparts, who seemed far less content about their
jobs and the people for whom, in the parlance of contemporary
politics, they served as ``handlers.''
</P>
<P>
   While 71 percent of the Republican consultants characterized the
quality of current House and Senate candidates as excellent or
good, only 39 percent of the Democratic consultants gave such high
marks to their candidates. Democrats were far more likely than
Republicans to say that the quality of congressional contenders had
diminished since they began working in politics.
</P>
<P>
   And while Democratic consultants were much more inclined than
Republicans to favor reforming campaign finance, Democrats placed
slightly more importance on making money as a motivation for their
working on behalf of a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the responses in the survey, conducted by telephone from
November 1997 to March 1998, appeared a bit contradictory.
Seventy-three percent of Democrats and 57 percent of Republicans
said negative campaigns caused cynicism among voters. But asked
whether the candidate or the consultant recommended going negative,
83 percent of the Democrats said consultants, as did 77 percent of
the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every respondent agreed that the news media devoted more
coverage to negative strategies, and 83 percent said voters were
more apt to respond to negative campaigning. And nearly two-thirds
said the way the news media reported on politics had a great deal
to do with cynicism in the electorate.
</P>
<P>
   While most consultants said negative campaigning was not
unethical, 41 percent said unethical conduct did sometimes occur.
More than half said the most common unethical practice related to
misrepresenting an opponent's positions in advertising or in
campaign oratory.
</P>
<P>
   The survey found that political consultants were
disproportionately white, male and wealthy. More than half had
annual family incomes of more than $150,000.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As President Clinton prepares to go to China this
week, the central foreign policy drama in Washington is the
increasing congressional furor over the administration's engagement
policy, in particular the sense that Clinton is damaging national
security in his eagerness to promote relations with Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional leaders, mostly Republican, argue that Clinton and
the executive branch are ignoring a pattern of Chinese exports of
dangerous nuclear, chemical and ballistic missile technology. The
motive, the critics say, is that the White House wants to avoid
imposing the sanctions that the law requires.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is also under new attack for authorizing the
export of commercial satellites for launching aboard Chinese
rockets, a process that may have provided technical details that
China could use to improve the accuracy of its nuclear-tipped
missiles.
</P>
<P>
   At the White House there is an equal and opposite frustration
with Congress for trying to ``micromanage'' relations with China.
Since the 1989 crackdown on student-led demonstrations in Tiananmen
Square, Congress has passed nearly 12 laws and amendments that try
to govern how the executive branch has to deal with proliferation.
Each measure has different standards of proof and rules of
enforcement, and some are so sweeping that billions of dollars of
trade are at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials complain that Congress confuses voting
on sanctions legislation with formulating a working policy on
nonproliferation and that Congress sets even stricter requirements
for Chinese behavior than international agreements do. In essence,
the officials complain, Congress does not allow the president to
take a broader, more nuanced view of American national interests.
They say the laws do not always provide the flexibility for the
executive branch to accomplish the real ends of the legislation,
less proliferation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some staffers up on the Hill who think that if we
embargoed every country we'd have the world's best nonproliferation
policy, whether it impeded anyone or not,'' said a senior official
with nearly a decade of work on those issues.
</P>
<P>
   But a senior congressional staffer with equal experience said
with equal bitterness: ``When it comes to implementing sanction
laws the executive traditionally takes the view that ends justify
the means. But the problem is that it degrades the credibility and,
thus, the deterrent effect of these sanctions if they're not
implemented when flagrantly triggered, even if the executive finds
some legal loophole.''
</P>
<P>
   The intense argument between the executive and legislative
branches reflects two approaches for dealing with China that are
not, at their core, partisan differences, although the renewed
presummit debate is intensely political. Although Republican
leaders, including the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, R-Miss.,
and Speaker Newt Gingrich are among Clinton's most vocal critics on
Chinese proliferation, Democratic senators including John Glenn of
Ohio have long shared some of the same concerns.
</P>
<P>
   There is wide agreement that China has significantly improved
its record on nuclear, missile, chemical and biological exports
since the 1980s, when it advocated nuclear proliferation as a form
of anticolonial equity. China gave Pakistan the design for a
nuclear weapon and the materials to make it, and it shipped
missiles to the Middle East. Prompting China to curtail such
exports has been its growing international maturity, combined with
pressure and engagement from the United States, including the apt
use of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``China's behavior is improving, the trend line is up, and there
is no longer any consistent pattern of willful flouting of
international obligations,'' a senior administration official said.
``But there are serious questions in the missile and chemical
areas, and to the extent the administration implies there is no
problem it doesn't help the cause and it infuriates the Congress.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked Sunday on the NBC News program ``Meet the Press'' about
China's proliferation record, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
said, ``A lot has been done and more needs to be done.''
</P>
<P>
   The attention from Republicans is on whether the Chinese
government illegally contributed to the Democratic Party and used
advice from U.S. aerospace companies to improve its strategic
missiles. But that feeds on the more longstanding and bitter
argument over whether China remains a dangerous exporter to Iran
and Pakistan and whether its behavior is improving through
engagement.
</P>
<P>
   The question remains: Is China keeping to its more responsible
commitments made since 1992 or is it just better at cheating?
</P>
<P>
   In the broadest sense this is just another chapter in the debate
about the wisdom of an engagement policy with China that dates from
Presidents Nixon, Reagan and Bush. Even Clinton, after criticizing
engagement in the 1992 presidential campaign, embraced it as the
best way to influence Chinese behavior in the next century.
</P>
<P>
   One skeptic is Robert Kagan of the Carnegie Endowment, who
complains that under Clinton, engagement is uncritical. Any action
to constrain Chinese behavior can be rationalized as harmful to the
larger goal of drawing China into international relationships that
may moderate the government in Beijing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My concern is about an approach that assumes in advance that
China will be our friend in the next century instead of saying
honestly that we don't know what China is going to be like, so we
have to hedge against certain possibilities,'' Kagan said. ``Russia
is our friend, too, but we have seriously hedged against Russia
going in a different direction by expanding NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   Kagan said he believed that Chinese access to sensitive U.S.
technologies and exports should ``not be an inducement for changing
behavior, but a reward for changed behavior.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the argument over China's true record can be answered only
with access to highly sensitive and sometimes ambiguous
intelligence material. Even that intelligence is debated, to see
whether it suffices as the indisputable evidence, or ``smoking
gun,'' that senior White House officials say even the Reagan and
Bush administrations required to impose sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The debates swirl over detailed findings about what might be in
certain crates shipped by China to Pakistan in the early '90s and
whether they contained missiles or missile parts, as is widely
believed but not proven. And if the crates did contain missiles,
were they Chinese M-11 missiles or another kind, and with what
range?
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, what specific help has China provided Pakistan to
build one certain factory in Rawalpindi, and is that factory
designed to produce missiles and, if so, what kind and what range,
and will they be considered Chinese or Pakistani?
</P>
<P>
   Those questions matter, because the different laws are specific
about what requires different sanctions. The only missiles subject
to sanctions fall under the Missile Technology Control Regime,
which covers those capable of carrying warheads of 500 kilograms,
or 1,100 pounds, at least 300 kilometers, 190 miles.
</P>
<P>
   National security is never separate from domestic politics, a
senior congressional staff member said, which is why presidents
from every party prefer not to receive perfect answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Clinton finds China sanctionable and then waives, he opens
himself up to political criticism that he's soft on the Chinese
despite a violation and is undermining the intent of the law,'' the
congressional staff member said. ``It's just easier to say we don't
know for sure, that the intelligence is ambiguous.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior U.S. official deeply engaged in China policy said that
no official could ignore a ``smoking gun'' without legal
consequences and that the interagency intelligence process was
pure. Missile sanctions affect trade with whole sectors of the
Chinese economy, so policy-makers have set a high evidentiary
threshold.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you sanction and you're wrong,'' the official said, ``your
credibility really goes out the window.''
</P>
<P>
   On dangerous exports of chemicals or equipment that could be
used for chemical warfare, however, the laws require a lower
threshold of evidence, simply ``knowing and material assistance''
to a chemical or biological weapons program on the American
terrorist list, and narrower sanctions, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``a lot of people in the intelligence community take
Pakistan as a test of their manhood,'' another senior
administration official said, ``they have a fundamentally different
mission, which is threat assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do we think Pakistan has M-11 missiles? Yeah, we do. And if we
were to go to war with Pakistan tomorrow I'd like our guys to be
prepared for M-11s. But that's different from a presidential
finding that we know for sure that they're there. Intel doesn't
have to be certain. But we do, according to the law.''

IRAN'S PARLIAMENT AND PRESIDENT CLASH OVER ONE OF HIS ALLIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ELAINE SCIOLINO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ In a high-stakes political battle filled with
recriminations and rage, Iran's Parliament voted Sunday to dismiss
one of the closest allies of Mohammad Khatami, the reform-minded
president.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami swiftly retaliated. He made Abdullah Noori, the ousted
minister of the interior, a vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament is controlled by Khatami's enemies. Its action Sunday
is the most serious political setback to his presidency since his
landslide victory 13 months ago as well as graphic proof of
Khatami's limited room for maneuver in Iran's Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The vote comes just just three days after Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright warmly praised Khatami and the reforms made
since he took office and held out the prospect of eventual
normalization of relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, 137-117 with 11 abstentions, came in a secret ballot
after several hours of impassioned debate in which Noori was
accused of arrogantly dismissing officials who did not share his
politics, fostering an unstable economic environment and putting
the country's security at risk.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was as much an attack against Khatami as it was against
Noori, and it is part of a wider campaign led by conservative
members of the clergy to discredit officials loyal to the
president.
</P>
<P>
   The parliamentary session was broadcast live on radio and later
on television as millions of Iranian viewers were awaiting the live
broadcast of the World Cup soccer match between the United States
and Iran at 11 p.m. Both opponents and supporters of Noori stepped
up to the lectern in the center of the parliamentary hall to air
their views.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the current trend continues, the result will be something
like Lebanon of a few years ago, or Yugoslavia,'' said Mohammad
Reza Bahonar, a deputy speaker of Parliament. ``Mr. Noori's
attitude is dangerous to the political future of the country.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In another angry speech, Marzieh Vahid-Dastjerdi, an
obstetrician and representative from Tehran who was dressed in the
traditional black chador, accused Noori of replacing 1,700
officials, primarily because they ``were not thinking like you.''
She also attacked Noori's definition of freedom, saying, ``For us,
freedom doesn't mean that counterrevolutionary groups can do
whatever they want and create anarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   In support of Noori, Majid Ansari, a member of Parliament from
Tehran, accused the minister's enemies of exaggerating Iran's
troubles as if ``Iran is on the verge of war.''
</P>
<P>
   Noori sat stone-faced during the speeches before offering a
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not claim I never made a mistake,'' he said. But he
accused his enemies of a plot to alienate Iran's young people from
the Islamic revolution and the clergy.
</P>
<P>
   Noori was reflecting the position voiced repeatedly by Khatami
and his supporters that what is at stake is nothing less than the
soul of the nation. According to this line of thinking, unless Iran
becomes freer at home and more open to the outside world, it will
lose the allegiance of the generation that has been born in the 19
years since the monarchy was overthrown.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami has therefore committed himself to the creation of a
``civil society'' and the ``rule of law'' at home and has reached
out to improve relations with both the Arab world and the West.
</P>
<P>
   But Khatami is fiercely opposed by those clerics _ and their
followers _ who believe that the core beliefs of the revolution are
being sacrificed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Parliament does not give me the vote of confidence, I will
thank God that he has lifted this heavy responsibility from my
shoulders, and I will see this as God's mercy,'' Noori said in his
speech. ``And if I get the vote of confidence, I will be energized
once again.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Whether Abdullah Noori remains or not, until the
last second of my life I will remain the servant of the system, the
revolution and the leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Parliament cast white ballots to dismiss Noori,
purple ballots to keep him and yellow ballots to abstain. Then Ali
Akbar Nateq-Noori, the Speaker of Parliament, announced in sober
tones, `` Abdullah Noori failed to win a vote of confidence.''
Several of the members shouted, ``God is great!''
</P>
<P>
   Nateq-Noori had been the front-runner for president and lost in
an upset to Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   Although Khatami acknowledged that Parliament had the right
under the Constitution to dismiss Noori, he reiterated his
determination to give the people the freedoms they hold under the
law. ``I and my administration are very serious about this
principle,'' he said. ``Of course, it has costs which must be paid,
just like building a bridge or a factory.''
</P>
<P>
   In introducing the dismissal motion last month, 31 members of
Parliament accused Noori of ``creating tension in society, giving
provocative interviews and speeches in different provinces and
appointing inexperienced people to managerial posts in the
ministry.''
</P>
<P>
   Noori, 49, a mid-ranking cleric from Isfahan, has been an
outspoken proponent of Khatami's commitment to impose a rule of law
and has come under fire for issuing permits to allow groups to
conduct peaceful demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Under the constitution, the country's spiritual leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and not the president, controls the
judiciary, as well as the military, radio and television and the
intelligence and security services.
</P>
<P>
   But Khatami has encouraged Noori to challenge decisions by the
judiciary _ particularly the arrest of Tehran Mayor Gholamhossein
Karabaschi, who is on trial on corruption and embezzlement charges.
The trial is broadcast on television in the evenings.
</P>
<P>
   Noori has also strongly supported Karabaschi and has openly
criticized the chief of the judiciary, Ayatollah Mohammed Yazdi,
for arresting the mayor in April without telling Noori.
</P>
<P>
   He said at the time, ``When the mayor of Tehran, who is a member
of the Cabinet, is arrested without informing the interior minister
or even the president and some public media resort to
rumor-mongering; when the mayor, with all his experience, is
prevented from having any visitors and an arrest warrant that is
totally inconsistent with the charges is issued for him; when
propaganda campaigns against the mayor and his colleagues are
launched for several consecutive months from every side and he
remains silent, like a wronged person, in the interest of the
state, what hope can an ordinary citizen have that the law will
defend his rights?''
</P>
<P>
   After several thousand people demonstrated in favor of the
mayor, he was released on bail.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Khatami defended Noori, calling him ``one of the
strongest ministers in the Cabinet.'' The President predicted that
Noori's ``absence from the Cabinet will entail massive damage for
the government and the country.''
</P>
<P>
   In a direct affront to Parliament, Khatami on Sunday cited
Noori's ``capabilities'' and created a job for him: vice president
for development and social affairs. The job keeps Noori in the
Cabinet and does not require Parliament's approval.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign that he had no intention of surrendering to
Parliament, Khatami appointed Mostafa Tajzadeh, a deputy minister
of the interior, as the acting minister. Tajzadeh, a staunch
supporter of the president, was also criticized Sunday by some
members of Parliament.

GIVE-AND-TAKE ON THE BUDGET SHOWS CONGRESS UNDER STRAIN
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As Congress counts down the weeks before it
adjourns for the November elections, the House and Senate are
getting down to the one task they are required to perform every
year _ passing the 13 spending bills that keep the government
running in the coming fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   The process is already showing the strains of the spending
limits imposed by the balanced-budget agreement that Congress
reached last year with the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   Even though experts are forecasting a budget surplus of as much
as $64 billion this year, lawmakers are constrained by strict
limits that raise the amount for day-to-day government operations
by only one percent over last year's levels, to about $533 billion.
But they also want to have something to brag about at home, and a
year of surpluses tempts many to reach into the treasury.
</P>
<P>
   The dynamics are further complicated by various ideological
divides _ between House and Senate Republicans, between both houses
and the administration, and among House Republicans themselves.
This blurs a sense of priorities, particularly as lawmakers
continue to pursue their own pet projects and as Democrats seek to
portray the Republicans as in complete chaos.
</P>
<P>
   There is no broad budget resolution to guide them, because the
House and Senate cannot agree on one. So lawmakers are using last
year's resolution as a map, recognizing that they may have to make
further cuts if a resolution is ever adopted. Beyond that, Congress
has already approved a massive highway bill that many members
believe has used up the little discretionary money they had.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the unresolved conflicts, lawmakers must keep to a
timetable that will have them discussing a half-dozen bills on the
floors of both the House and Senate this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everybody's going to get what they want,'' said Rep.
Robert Livingston, the Louisiana Republican who is chairman of the
House Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, the top Democrat on the
committee, said that the appropriations process was already a
charade. ``It's difficult for individual members to figure out what
in God's name is going on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Obey said that while Republicans wanted to appear to be holding
the line on spending, they had privately sought out Livingston and
requested 7,000 items that would raise total spending by $278
million.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans are caught between their philosophical desire
to shrink the size of government and certain political imperatives
that cost money, like cutting taxes, financing local projects and
wanting to avoid the ``extremist'' label for program cuts that the
more liberal Senate will most likely restore.
</P>
<P>
   The tension between the two goals was threatening to disrupt the
House, but on Friday, House leaders quelled a mini-rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Both conservatives and moderates were worried about the
budget-busting potential of a $4 billion appropriation that Speaker
Newt Gingrich and Livingston had put toward solving the year 2000
computer problem, which could hobble the government at the end of
the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   Livingston and Gingrich had cast the $4 billion as an emergency
_ a designation that allows Congress to spend money without having
to seek equal cuts in some other program. But many members railed
at this as a gimmick.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders _ including Gingrich _ backed off the plan. They
agreed instead to put the $4 billion into a separate bill and to
make $4 billion in cuts elsewhere, although they did not say where.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., said of the action, ``It was
about whether we were going to keep to the budget agreement or go
back to the old ways like the transportation bill, when we voted
out more projects than we could afford and busted the budget to
smithereens.'' That was just weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The process is fraught with such problems. One of the most
difficult is that in such a tight budget, spending for one lawmaker
invariably means cuts for another.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Rep. Tom DeLay, R-Texas, urged a subcommittee last
week not to agree to a $50 million proposal by Vice President Al
Gore to send pictures of Earth by satellite to computers 24 hours a
day. DeLay said private companies could pay for the pictures if
anyone wanted them.
</P>
<P>
   This prompted Obey to suggest that if Gore's project was not
being financed because he was a Democrat, Democrats might highlight
projects sought by Gingrich, such as a $5.5 million designation for
programs at the American Museum of Natural History (Gingrich is
fond of animals), and $15 million to buy land in the Chattahoochee
River watershed in Georgia, Gingrich's home state.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, in another subcommittee, Rep. Sidney Yates,
D-Ill., suggested eliminating the Chattahoochee project so that
Illinois could build a visitors' center in a national park honoring
the starting point of the Lewis and Clark expedition.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, defended the Chattahoochee land
acquisition, saying it would prevent development of a major
recreation area. And he opposed the visitors' center for Illinois,
saying he had requests from 18 members to finance centers in parks
throughout the country and that he could not pick one over the
other.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, moments later, Rep. Charles Taylor, a Republican,
sought money for a visitors' center in his district in western
North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Regula pointed out that he had just said there was no money for
visitors' centers. Taylor protested, saying if he could not have
the money, then Congress should ``cleanse all visitors' centers of
information.''
</P>
<P>
   Yates, still eager for his Lewis and Clark center, jumped in.
``If I vote for yours,'' he asked Taylor, ``will you vote for
mine?''

A THRIVING TRACK DEEP IN TEXAS OFFERS SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas _ Jerry Jeff Walker has wailed beer-soaked
ballads in the paddock garden. Thousands of children have been
encouraged to wander through the petting zoo and family playground.
And Friday night, Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie played host to 12
of the nation's top riders in an unusual competition called the
all-star jockey championship.
</P>
<P>
   Situated halfway between Dallas and Fort Worth, Lone Star is in
the second year of a remarkably successful launch into the troubled
world of thoroughbred racing. The track's secret has been to offer
customers more than the simple prospect of betting on horses and
instead try to be as many things to as many people as possible.
</P>
<P>
   In that spirit came the jockey showdown, and before a capacity
crowd of 16,156 and a national television audience on ESPN2, Shane
Sellers collected $25,000 and the championship for gaining the most
points over four races against 11 of his celebrated peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The horses ran for me tonight,'' said Sellers, who outpointed
Julie Krone, 36-18, by winning three of the four races, including
bringing in a &UR;  &LR; 44-1 shot, Miami Flyer. ``I always said that when
you get a certain caliber of rider, the only thing that separates
you is the horse.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been some encouraging signs recently in thoroughbred
racing, which is coming off a thrilling Triple Crown campaign and
finally has a well-financed central-marketing office to help guide
the sport into an increasingly crowded marketplace. And when the
newly formed National Thoroughbred Racing Association was looking
for a vehicle to help create year-round awareness for its sport, it
gravitated to this hustling Texas track and the second annual
jockey championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We not only wanted to spike attendance and handles, we wanted
to create a fun, happening event, to make a national splash,'' said
Tim Smith, the national association's chairman. Smith used a
portion of his $20 million budget to promote the jockey
championship nationally with a sweepstakes contest and the purchase
of television coverage.
</P>
<P>
   The jockey showcase is a departure for a regionalized industry
that has been slow to react to the onslaught of legalized gambling
and the sophisticated marketing techniques of other sports.
Twenty-five years ago, horse racing accounted for 28 percent of all
legally wagered money. In 1996, it totaled 7.8 percent, according
to International Gaming and Wagering Business magazine. Attendance
at the nation's tracks has declined from 54.4 million in 1991 to
34.4 million today.
</P>
<P>
   But 80,162 people showed up at Belmont Park this month to
witness Victory Gallop launch a stirring stretch drive and prevent
Real Quiet from completing the first Triple Crown in 20 years. It
was the second straight year that a horse had gone to Belmont with
a chance to win the Triple Crown, comprising the Kentucky Derby,
the Preakness and the Belmont Stakes. And it was the second
straight year that the bid ended with a narrow defeat at the wire.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt the horses are our stars, but we're out there
365 days a year,'' said Gary Stevens, who rode Victory Gallop this
year and just missed winning the Triple Crown in 1997 aboard Silver
Charm. ``And we can be the face you put on horse racing to appeal
to new fans who don't know about our sport.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Lone Star jockey competition, those faces were among the
most accomplished in the sport. As a group, the 12 have won more
than 57,000 races for a staggering $1.56 billion in purses,
including victories in 38 Triple Crown events and 51 Breeders' Cup
races. But they also represented a cross-section of the sport's
potential appeal.
</P>
<P>
   They ranged in age from 25-year-old Marlon St. Julien, a black
rider who is becoming a star on the Texas-Louisiana circuit, to
51-year-old Laffit Pincay, a legendary Panamanian who is pursuing
Bill Shoemaker's career record of 8,833 victories.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Bailey, a three-time Eclipse award winner, and Mike Smith
represented New York. Pat Day, a five-time Preakness winner, and
Sellers came from Kentucky. Canada's leading rider, Sandy Hawley,
was also on hand. Eddie Delahoussaye, Kent Desormeaux and Chris
McCarron, with Stevens and Pincay, rounded out the California
contingent. Krone, the most heralded female jockey, came from New
Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Lone Star Park conducted the program with both the new fan and
the educated gambler in mind _ north Texas possesses a
knowledgeable fan base that for years traveled to nearby Arkansas
and Louisiana to play the horses. The jockeys were mobbed at a
pre-race autograph session, and bands blasted rock-and-roll between
races.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an atmosphere that every race track should have,''
said Sellers, who watched Krone do a cartwheel and a back flip
during the jockey introductions. ``They've given us some
showmanship, and we're having a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The track even came up with a special wager available here and
in 138 simulcast sites nationwide, allowing fans to bet on which
jockey would win the championship. Sellers paid $14.80 for a $2 bet
to win the contest, and he and Krone together paid $150.80 for a $2
exacta.
</P>
<P>
   It is that same combination of promotion and quality racing
(Lone Star offers a daily average of $200,000 in purses) that has
attracted the country's top horses and trainers, including the best
in the stable of Bob Baffert, the trainer of both Silver Charm and
Real Quiet.
</P>
<P>
   Those efforts have helped Lone Star Park average 9,700 in daily
attendance and improve its wagering handle by 5 percent over last
year, to more than $3.1 million a day. This has been accomplished
despite the presence of four major league sports franchises and
auto racing within a 35-mile radius of the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not enough to be a world-class thoroughbred facility,''
said Corey Johnsen, vice president and general manager of Lone
Star. ``You have to position yourself as a world-class
entertainment center. You've got to give people a reason to come
try you before you can educate and make them fans for life.''

THE MAN WHO TURNED SENSE INTO CHARMED NONSENSE
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Then comes this declaration: ``Nobody is despised who
can manage a crocodile.''
</P>
<P>
   And, as if in an afterthought: ``Illogical persons are
despised.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which is perfectly plausible. So what, Lewis Carroll asks
in one of his books about symbolic logic, is the proper conclusion?
</P>
<P>
   Such are the slight amusements that I recall thinking about on
those leisurely childhood ``golden afternoons'' like the one
Carroll invoked at the beginning of ``Alice's Adventures in
Wonderland.'' But in place of Alice's rabbit hole or looking glass,
her flamingo croquet mallet and the promise of Mock Turtle Soup, I
had recourse to Carroll himself, spinning out fractured syllogisms
or oddly twisted homilies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Be what you would seem to be,'' the Duchess sagely advised
Alice. ``Or, if you'd like to put it more simply, never imagine
yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others
that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what
you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   Exactly.
</P>
<P>
   Which is what came to mind when visiting the exhibition ``a k a
Lewis Carroll,'' at the Morgan Library through Aug. 30: the way in
which Carroll transformed advice and sentimentality into perfectly
sensible nonsense, leaving in its wake a kind of unsettling
dizziness, or even, to put it less mildly, a form of nausea.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, amid the Morgan's memorabilia and exotica _ the
souvenirs of Disney's ``Alice'' movie, the ``Alice'' illustrations
that Guinness once used to advertise its brew, a translation of
``Alice'' into Pitjantjatjara (the aboriginal language of South
Australia) in which the rabbit became a kangaroo and the screaming
baby a bandicoot _ there was Carroll himself. Or at least enough of
him to awaken a childhood recollection of his strangely packed
mixtures of rationality and subversion.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at his postcard written in mirror script or seeing the
photo he took of his Lolita-muse, Alice Liddell, seductively got up
as a beggar-waif, it is clear just how little he was what he seemed
to be. He could have been a version of Alice, unable to respond
confidently when challenged by the hookah-smoking Caterpillar with
``Who are you?''
</P>
<P>
   By now the paradoxes of his life have entered literary
mythology. The mathematician Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, an Oxford
don, was reported to have been quite a dull lecturer. But when he
adopted a pseudonym, he created exuberant fantasies for children
that leave the chalk board and lecture hall far behind.
</P>
<P>
   He was eminently respectable, a lifelong bachelor and a close
family friend of the college's dean; but he was also almost
obsessively infatuated with the dean's prepubescent daughters,
particularly Alice Liddell, who, at the age of 10, was the
inspiration for his Alice books. And while in his diaries there are
traces of the stern moralist grimly recording his struggles with
unspecified temptations, in his books he turned all moral lessons
on their heads.
</P>
<P>
   That overturning of sense and sensibility was almost an
obsession of the Alice books. Carroll would take a trite poem with
its period parental advice (``Speak Gently! It is better far/To
rule by love than fear'') and transmute it into a grotesquerie:
``Speak roughly to your little boy/ And beat him when he sneezes!''
He would take a familiar kitschy warning against laziness (``'Tis
the voice of the sluggard'; I heard him complain,/`You have wak'd
me too soon, I must slumber again.''') and turn it into nonsense:
``'Tis the voice of the Lobster: I heard him declare/`You have
baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair.'''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   These burlesques of familiar Victorian commonplaces must have
once caused as much uneasiness as they do in Alice when she hears
them recited by the denizens of Wonderland. Some hint of the effect
can now be gotten from David Del Tredici's ``Alice'' compositions,
many of which set these verses in ways both fantastical and
nightmarish. His latest setting, given its premiere by the New York
Philharmonic last month, was of ``The Spider and the Fly,'' a
Victorian morality tale for young virgins. (```Will you walk into
my parlor?' said the spider to the fly.'') A fly resists the
spider's seductive offerings of fine, thinly spun sheets on which
to rest, but finally succumbs to blunt flattery.
</P>
<P>
   Del Tredici treats this as a miniopera, exaggerating the scale,
so it becomes a scene like one witnessed by Alice in one of her
many changes in size. As a result, the poem's solemn piety is
dissolved into a kind of wistful amusement at something from
another universe. Carroll dissolved it even more completely:
</P>
<P>
   ``Will you walk a little faster?'' said a whiting to a snail.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my
tail.''
</P>
<P>
   This is sleight of hand of a very high order, mocking moral
convention while apparently just creating nonsense. Something is at
stake in this satire, something that may be connected to the
unhappiness his biographer, Morton Cohen, finds in Carroll's life.
It may have arisen, in part, from Carroll's inability or
unwillingness to reconcile the disruptive looking-glass world with
the tautly controlled order of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen points out one occasion when some kind of disturbing
fantasy may have even broken through the veneer. Something took
place during late June 1863, after Alice had already inspired
Wonderland, that led to a nearly complete break between Carroll and
the Liddells.
</P>
<P>
   Was it some sort of inappropriate behavior involving Alice?
(Cohen suggests a premature marriage proposal.) Or was it something
far less respectable, (which Cohen does not think too plausible)?
We will never know: The journal page on which Carroll had recorded
his transgression was neatly excised by a niece who found the
revelation too shocking.
</P>
<P>
   But whatever the excision, the dark judgment is in the ``Alice''
books: the little girl who is mistaken for a serpent; the Queen who
keeps shouting, ``Off with his head,'' the overturned jury box of
rodents and lizards. Carroll created a children's literature that
discarded any pretense of simple moral lesson or rosy pleasantries,
reaching back to the eeriness of the Mother Goose rhymes or the
Grimm fairy tales.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll's heirs range from P.L. Travers, who created a
ruthlessly unsentimental Mary Poppins, to Maurice Sendak, whose
painterly images of dream worlds can be more unsettling to adults
than to children.
</P>
<P>
   But Carroll also tamed the irrationality by giving his nonsense
logical form. The effect in our own era of fierce conventions can
be bracing. Forget the issues of being and seeming, of propriety
and guilt, of threats and recriminations. Carroll offers
alternative advice:
</P>
<P>
   ```The time has come,' the Walrus said,
</P>
<P>
   `To talk of many things:
</P>
<P>
   Of shoes and ships and sealing wax
</P>
<P>
   Of cabbages and kings
</P>
<P>
   And why the sea is boiling hot
</P>
<P>
   And whether pigs have wings.'''
</P>
<P>
   Incidentally, the correct conclusion is that babies cannot
manage crocodiles.

SKIP AWAY NOT YET CLEARED FOR HOLLYWOOD GOLD CUP
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Skip Away, who developed a slight swelling in his legs over the
weekend, was reported to be much improved Sunday. But his trainer,
Sonny Hine, said he would wait until his star horse worked out
Tuesday before clearing him to travel to California to race Silver
Charm and Gentlemen next Sunday in the $1 million Hollywood Gold
Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We walked him this morning, and his legs looked much better,''
Hine said at Belmont Park in New York. ``He had a minor filling
above the knees in both legs. It's gone now, and we're leaning more
toward going. We'll make every effort. We'll jog him Monday
morning, and breeze him Tuesday, and hopefully leave Thursday. He's
never been lame or sore.''
</P>
<P>
   Hine said Skip Away's legs were apparently strained during an
exercise gallop Friday morning when he swerved to avoid a horse
that had fallen in the mud. Skip Away, the champion older horse
last year and champion 3-year-old in 1996, unseated his rider, Jose
Sanchez, and got loose for 20 minutes before he was brought back by
an outrider.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Charm, the winner of the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness
last year, was unexpectedly booked into the Gold Cup on Friday
afternoon. He left Churchill Downs in Louisville, Ky., Sunday and
flew to Los Angeles to run against his two chief rivals for honors
among older horses. He is 4 years old, Skip Away is 5 and Gentlemen
is 6.
</P>
<P>
   The Hollywood Gold Cup, at a mile and a quarter, would be the
first meeting of the three horses. But the handlers of all three
have expressed interest in running in the $1 million Pacific
Classic at Del Mar in August, the Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont
Park in October and, ultimately, in the $4 million Breeders' Cup
Classic at Churchill Downs in November.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Mandella, the trainer of Gentlemen, who has won 9 of his
last 12 starts, acknowledged from Hollywood Park that his senior
star had not raced since he finished fourth and last in the Santa
Anita Handicap in March. But he added: ``He showed some bleeding
after the Big Cap, and needed antibiotics and some rest to clear
his lungs. But he always runs like gangbusters when he's fresh. And
I think he's going to run his eyeballs off.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandella was asked how he reacted to the late entry of Silver
Charm and the late problem with Skip Away, and lightheartedly
replied, ``I'd just as soon they'd both stay home.'' &QL;

SAMPRAS IS A MARKED MAN AT WIMBLEDON
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By ROBIN FINN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ They have put down new outdoor carpeting on
the Center Court since Pete Sampras won the Wimbledon title last
year, an ambitious bit of redecorating not tried here for the past
30 years.
</P>
<P>
   For Sampras and for Wimbledon, change is rarely a welcome
commodity. But since he will be getting a toehold on the usual
rugged blend of natural rye and fescue that he has trampled all
four times he has won this championship, the innovation should not
prove too unsettling for Sampras. He has more pressing problems to
deal with than the greenery.
</P>
<P>
   Though Sampras is as tradition-minded as the keepers of this All
England Club, the underage grass figures to be the least of his
worries as he seeks to become the first man since Bjorn Borg to
capture five Wimbledon titles. He has a slump to shake off and a
drought in Grand Slam events to repair, not to mention a full cast
of characters intent on taking advantage of his fallibility through
the first half of 1998. Had Sampras performed up to snuff this year
at the Grand Slam events, he might already have tied Roy Emerson's
career record dozen championships by now; instead, he has come into
Wimbledon behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not easy when you're trying to break records,'' said
Sampras, who will inaugurate the fresh grass, and test his 38-5
Wimbledon record against Slovakia's Dominik Hrbaty, on Monday
afternoon. ``I've been a marked man for most of my career, and if
you're not playing well, you're going to go through a little bit of
a slump, and I have, but I always seem to be able to play my way
out of them, and that's my frame of mind. I feel like it's kind of
like coming home.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras' homey rapport with Center Court, however, hasn't
convinced him that he will be enjoying an unconditional two-week
lease on the property. ``It's pretty much anyone's ball game this
year,'' he said. ``I look at probably eight guys that can win
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the top-seeded Sampras, most of those guys are
coming in with even more flaws than he has been lamenting.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras said the potential threats include the brute servers
such as fourth-seeded Greg Rusedski, who has a sprained ankle,
14th-seeded Goran Ivanisevic, who received a 10-spot improvement
from Wimbledon's seeding committee in deference to his final-round
appearances in 1992 and 1994, and the 1996 champion Richard
Krajicek.
</P>
<P>
   But Krajicek, like Australia's sixth-seeded Patrick Rafter, the
slump-ridden U.S. Open champion, has yet to prove that he is
capable of winning more than one Grand Slam event.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the superlative servers, Sampras gave a nod in the
direction of stylish returners such as 13th-seeded Andre Agassi and
eighth-seeded Cedric Pioline; but both of them arrived with less
than intimidating grass-court preparation.
</P>
<P>
   True to his maverick sensibilities, Agassi, who suffered a
demeaning opening-round loss to Russia's Marat Safin, an
18-year-old qualifier, at the French Open, was the only seeded man
to avoid all of the grass-court warm-up events. After all, he won
the 1992 title here after electing to do the same haphazard
preparation, much of it on the hardcourts that he claims hone his
timing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very dangerous here; anyone that's won a Grand Slam and
is coming back to play it again, you've got to look at him as a
threat,'' Sampras said. ``He returns probably the best in the game,
and that shot is just as important as the serve on grass.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Pioline, last year's surprise runner-up, his Wimbledon
preparation was made on a conspicuously sour note. He was ejected
at Nottingham for cursing at the chair umpire, Pedro Bravo, during
his match against Australia's Scott Draper, this year's Queen's
Club champion.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi opens Monday on Court 1 against Alex Calatrava, another
Spaniard with no Wimbledon credentials, but Pioline could encounter
an immediate stumbling block in Switzerland's Marc Rosset.
</P>
<P>
   No. 7-seeded Yevgeny Kafelnikov, who won the Halle title only to
have his grass-court prowess evaporate last week at Rosmalen, where
Detroit's Steve Campbell upended him, has the versatility to mount
an impressive Wimbledon campaign. But he, like Sampras, has been
experiencing some confidence tremors of late, and his first-round
assignment against Mark Philippoussis, whose gigantic serve is
dwarfed by the colossal unreliability of the rest of his strokes,
will be a litmus test.
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of Sampras, not one of the players who has
picked up a title at the last five Grand Slam events has managed to
collect a title since. And Petr Korda, the Australian Open
champion, has botched repeated chances to supplant Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   But Carlos Moya, the new French Open champion, vowed to defy a
1-2 record on these lawns and live up to his fifth-place seeding:
``You know, if I win Wimbledon, maybe I'm No. 1, huh? You never
know. I don't think it's going to be the case, but I'm going there
to learn to play good tennis, to improve.'' &QL;

PHILADELPHIA TO TEST NRA THEORY OF GUN CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Nev.)   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   RENO, Nev. _ Against the vivid backdrop of recent fatal school
shootings, elected officials across the United States for the first
time are coordinating efforts, sometimes with unlikely partners, to
reduce the incidents of gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   In perhaps the most unusual of the collaborations, Philadelphia
Mayor Edward Rendell has agreed to join forces with the National
Rifle Association to create a model program in Philadelphia to test
one of the NRA's core beliefs, that vigorous prosecution of people
who violate federal gun laws would eliminate more violent crime
than tighter gun-control laws.
</P>
<P>
   In a broader effort aimed at finding other solutions to the same
problems, representatives of the nation's firearms industry have
formed a task force with several mayors and county executives to
study innovative ways to prevent guns from getting into the hands
of children and criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Rendell's pending collaboration with the NRA arose out of a
challenge by the association's new president, actor Charlton
Heston. At the NRA's convention two weeks ago in Philadelphia _ to
which Rendell was not invited because of his support for tighter
gun-control measures _ Heston proposed that the federal government
designate one large U.S. city to test the NRA's theory that most
gun violence occurs because the criminal justice system is not
tough enough on criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Heston suggested Philadelphia might be a good place to test it,
because homicide rates there have held steady over the last decade,
at more than 400 a year, despite what Rendell contends have been
vigorous prosecutions and harsh prison sentences.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter he sent to Heston last week, the mayor said he would
accept the challenge, conceding that a partnership between
Philadelphia and the NRA ``would produce dramatic results'' in
reducing the sale of handguns to criminals and the level of gun
violence in a city where it has become commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   To win approval for a three-year program that would likely cost
as much as $5 million to send extra federal prosecutors and agents
into Philadelphia, the NRA has agreed to lobby Congress for
support, and Rendell has agreed to what may be the more formidable
task, winning the backing of the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they'll get Congress' support,'' Rendell said in an
interview in Reno, Nev., where he addressed the U.S. Conference of
Mayors on Sunday. ``The question is whether the administration will
support it.''
</P>
<P>
   NRA executive director Wayne LaPierre said in a telephone
interview that he has assurances from Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott and House Speaker Newt Gingrich that they would ``work to
provide any resources needed'' to create the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the NRA, the Congress and Mayor Rendell standing shoulder
to shoulder on the streets of Philadelphia,'' LaPierre said, ``the
only question is whether the White House will be on the street with
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Cutler, a senior White House official attending the
conference, predicted that the president would be receptive to
exploring the idea even though Heston sharply attacked him
politically and personally at the NRA convention.
</P>
<P>
   Rendell also played a hand in creating the task force. At the
NRA convention, he and several other mayors, including Scott King
of Gary, Ind., and Clarence Harmon of St. Louis, met with
representatives of the gun industry and agreed they would spend six
months developing ideas aimed at reducing crimes committed with
guns but not infringing upon the rights of law-abiding citizens to
own guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to do something,'' Rendell said in his speech here
Sunday. ``Guns are making life in our cities intolerable.''
</P>
<P>
   In the speech Sunday, Rendell outlined various issues the task
force intends to study, including these:
</P>
<P>
   _ Rather than encourage states to pass ``one-gun-a-month''
legislation, as some have, much to the annoyance of gun control
opponents, Rendell said states might consider ``straw-man
purchase'' legislation, which would have the same effect, cutting
down resale markets on the street, but would sound more acceptable
to opponents of gun control.
</P>
<P>
   _ Many guns are stolen from dealers and distributors. The task
force plans to look into how security around guns in transit might
be tightened.
</P>
<P>
   _ While ammunition makers have already stopped producing
armor-piercing bullets and clips that hold more than 10 rounds, the
group will look for ways to buy back those that remain on gun store
shelves.
</P>
<P>
   _ In what Rendell called an initiative that has ``the most
potential of all,'' the group is discussing ways gun makers can
step up research and development of sophisticated technologies that
would make it difficult or impossible for a gun to be discharged by
anyone but its owner.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Feldman, executive director of the American Shooting
Sports Council, which represents the gun industry's manufacturers,
distributors and retailers, followed Rendell to the microphone
Sunday and told the mayors that his organization was no less
frustrated with gun violence in America than they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have to start thinking outside of the box for
solutions,'' he said, indicating that he was optimistic that the
task force could provide some answers.
</P>
<P>
   But Feldman drew sharp distinctions with those who believe an
overall reduction in gun sales would ease the problem of gun
violence. Reminding the audience of President Clinton's initiative
to put 100,000 more police on the streets, a major part of the 1994
crime bill, Feldman said, ``That's 100,000 more guns on the street.
The issue isn't guns or the number; it's in whose hands are they?''
</P>
<P>
   Rendell was especially insistent that technological advances
could ultimately make the biggest difference in preventing children
and criminals from using guns. Computer chips that would
``personalize'' guns for the owner, he said, would eliminate straw
purchases and make the theft of guns useless.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the industry's concern that such technology is too
expensive, Rendell brought out a favorite analogy, resistance of
car makers 20 years ago to install air bags. ``Now,'' he said,
``they are voluntarily putting in side air bags because the
American public wants them.''
</P>
<P>
   But in response to a question from Mayor Jim Dailey of Little
Rock, Ark., Feldman cautioned against expecting too much from
technology. He said much of the technology under development would
render guns useless only for a moment and that five or 10 minutes
later, they could be discharged by someone other than the owner.
</P>
<P>
   At that, Rendell pulled the microphone from Feldman and said,
``If we can do the first, we can probably do the second. There's no
excuse for not developing that technology.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview later, Feldman held his cautious position,
saying that any practical advances will take up to a decade to
refine and even then would likely be available only to law
enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you look for an easy fix for the violent crime in
America, you find yourself looking at things that won't work,'' he
said. ``It's better to take a series of smaller steps.''

COMMENTARY: POLITICS BY OTHER MEANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr likes to say that he is going ``by the book'' in
his investigation of President Clinton and Monica Lewinsky. The
relevant book is the Justice Department's Rules of Conduct,
published in the Code of Federal Regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Rule 77.5 says that a government lawyer ``may not communicate''
with a party ``who the attorney for the government knows is
represented by an attorney concerning the subject matter of the
representation without the consent of the lawyer representing such
party.''
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 16 Starr's office arranged to have Linda Tripp meet
Monica Lewinsky at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Pentagon City.
Suddenly Starr's agents descended on Ms. Lewinsky. They questioned
her for many hours.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky was represented by Francis Carter, who was
negotiating for her with Paula Jones' lawyers. Starr did not ask
Carter's consent to speak with his client, or even inform him.
</P>
<P>
   Violation of that rule was not a light matter. The Independent
Counsel Act requires such a counsel to follow Justice Department
regulations unless that would undermine the purpose of the act _
which respecting the right to a lawyer plainly would not _ and
makes failure to obey the rules ``good cause'' for the attorney
general to remove a counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has also violated, wholesale, the rules against
prosecutors talking to the press about pending investigations. If
anyone doubted that, it has now been made unanswerably clear by
Steven Brill's meticulous marshaling of the evidence in the first
issue of Brill's Content.
</P>
<P>
   In his angry reply to the article, Starr never denied saying to
Brill: ``I have talked with reporters on background on some
occasions, but Jackie (Bennett Jr., his deputy) has been the
primary person involved in that. He has spent much of his time
talking to individual reporters.''
</P>
<P>
   Brill said the Starr and Bennett talks with the press violated
Rule 6e of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which forbid
disclosure of grand-jury information. Starr argued in reply that
Rule 6e did not apply because he and his staff disclosed not
grand-jury testimony but information obtained elsewhere and
comments on it.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the merits of the legal argument about Rule 6e, didn't
the Starr leaks violate ethical rules and Justice Department
regulations? When Brill asked that question, Starr replied that
they would be violations except when he was ``countering
misinformation'' about his office. ``We have a duty to promote
confidence in the work of this office.''
</P>
<P>
   What a breathtaking assertion. It means that whenever anyone
disagrees with him, Starr has a right to break the rules and become
an unnamed source for some journalist ready to convey his version
of the story. In politics, that is called spinning.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's assertion that his leaks are only to counter
misinformation was also false. On the day the Lewinsky story broke,
Jan. 21, Starr told Brill, Jackie Bennett spent ``much of the day
briefing the press.'' That was before there was any
``misinformation'' to answer.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's veracity is in question on another matter. The Brill
article says Michael Isikoff of Newsweek told Brill that Jackie
Bennett asked him to hold up writing about Monica Lewinsky in
January because ``they were going to try to get Lewinsky to wire
herself and get (Vernon) Jordan and maybe even the president on
tape obstructing justice.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr said his office had ``never asked Ms. Lewinsky to agree to
wire herself for a conversation with Jordan or the president.'' But
it was not only Isikoff who said that happened. Ms. Lewinsky's
lawyers said in February, in Time magazine, that the prosecutors
``wanted her wired ... to record telephone calls with the president
of the U.S., Vernon Jordan and others'' _ and made her consent a
condition of being given immunity from prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   We all know that prosecutors leak. But Starr has been so
sanctimonious, so insistent that he never leaks.
</P>
<P>
   Far from going ``by the book,'' he has in many ways abused his
extraordinary power. Most Americans perceive that. Others are so
critical of President Clinton that they overlook Starr's abuses.
They need reminding that however tempting the target of a
prosecutor, the end does not justify abusive means.

GINETTE MATHIOT, 91, FRENCH COOKING EXPERT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ROBERT McG. THOMAS Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ginette Mathiot, who taught French cooking to the French with
such succinct authority that her basic book of recipes sold more
than 5 million copies, died June 14 at a retirement home in Paris.
She was 91 and best known for her 1932 classic, ``I Know How to
Cook.''
</P>
<P>
   In a country whose vaunted cuisine has been largely the province
of men, the title of that book, Miss Mathiot's first, has a certain
ring of defiance, and no wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Paris in an era when women in France had far fewer
career choices than they do today, Miss Mathiot, who was chastising
the French cooking establishment as a sexist, male-dominated
bastion long after opportunities for women improved, chafed at the
restrictions from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   If she couldn't do anything else, at least she could cook, and
if anybody doubted her, it wasn't the generations of French
homemakers who turned her book into the bible of the French
kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   Raised in an austere household headed by her father, a
Protestant minister, she was a brilliant student in secondary
school, becoming a disciple of Simone Weil, the ascetic philosopher
and mystic. But when she expressed an interest in studying
medicine, she was persuaded instead to take teaching courses at the
Sorbonne and eventually to specialize in the French version of home
economics as a more appropriate outlet for a woman than medicine.
</P>
<P>
   She rose to the top of her academic field, becoming an inspector
general in the French homemaking academy before French education
authorities withdraw recognition of homemaking as an academic
discipline.
</P>
<P>
   By her own account Miss Mathiot garnered a total of seven
marriage proposals but her father rejected each of her suitors on
religious grounds (none were Protestant) and although Miss Mathiot
considered rebelling, in the end, she said, she found she couldn't
and bowed to her family's wishes.
</P>
<P>
   After she established a life and career away from her family,
the proposals kept coming, but Miss Mathiot continued to reject
them, she said, though for reasons of her own.
</P>
<P>
   If it was a father's stern will that forced her to become a home
economics teacher, it was another man's inspired whim _ and a bit
of luck _ that led her from the backwaters of education to the
front burner of French cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   While Miss Mathiot was still studying to be a teacher at the
Paris Training School of Homemaking at the beginning of the
Depression, Albin Michel, a portly French publisher, decided that a
cookbook emphasizing nutrition might help his ailing business, not
to mention his waistline, by appealing to what he perceived as a
broad public fascination with the developments of modern science,
including advances in nutritional understanding.
</P>
<P>
   When leading authorities on French cuisine turned him down,
Michel proposed the project to the head of a local college's
science department, who also turned him down but set off a chain of
recommendations that finally led Michel to the 23-year-old Miss
Mathiot, who said yes.
</P>
<P>
   Her book, which included 2,000 recipes covering the canon of
French cuisine from lobster bisque to crepe suzette, was an
immediate sensation and paved the way for sequels, among them books
on bread, pastry and even camping-trips cooking.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to emphasizing nutrition, Miss Mathiot's books
appealed to family cooks because they showed how to keep food costs
down while remaining true to the spirit of French cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Like ``The Joy of Cooking'' in the United States, ``I Know How
to Cook'' and other Mathiot books served as primers for novice
cooks, leading readers from the basics of food preparation through
simple recipes to more elaborate concoctions.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who presided over what she saw as a kitchen with
millions of stoves, Miss Mathiot, who leaves no immediate
survivors, never took anything for granted.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone following a cake recipe, for example, might think the end
had been reached with the instruction to remove the cake from the
oven, but Miss Mathiot, mindful of the distractions of a triumphant
moment, would have one more instruction: Turn off the oven.

ESSAY: DEALING WITH WITH CHINA'S ACE IN THE HOLE
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Never has a U.S. president traveled to Beijing at
such a disadvantage: Bill Clinton has reason to suspect that the
Chinese leaders possess information about ``the China connection''
to his campaigns, but he does not know what it is.
</P>
<P>
   He knows that they know much more than anyone about the
penetration of the White House by Asian fronts for Chinese
intelligence. They have all the details about Indonesia's Riady
family's long-term investment in his career, and probably of
instructions to influence his post-election change of trade policy.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton must assume it is in China's interest to provide an
escape hatch for 50 fleeing witnesses, to deny being the source of
millions in campaign contributions and to keep secret Democratic
money laundering done by Hong Kong and Macao banks. China will want
to conceal from the Justice Department and Congress the illegal
donations to, and policy penetration of, the White House and DNC.
</P>
<P>
   In obstructing any investigation, the interests of China run
parallel to those of this compromised U.S. president. Both Clinton
and the Chinese want nothing further to come out. Accept, if you
wish, the protestations of Clinton defenders that his campaign
organization was duped by John Huang, Charlie Trie and Maria Hsia,
and was ignorant of the source of the Asian funds solicited from
Johnny Chung. Buy, if you like, the notion that the payments had
nothing to do with flip-flops on trade and the technology-transfer
triumph over the Pentagon by anything-goes Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   But even if China's quid was not ``solely'' responsible for
Clinton's quo, the fact remains that secret Chinese money passed
and U.S. policy changed. The unspoken truth haunting this summit is
that China's leaders have something on this president.
</P>
<P>
   Would they use this illicit leverage to gain a concession? Of
course not; Chinese diplomacy can be exquisitely subtle. No winks
of understanding will be needed.
</P>
<P>
   In this charade, Clinton will formally ask the Chinese to
cooperate with the Congress and the Department of Justice, and
China's Jiang will formally promise to help. Perhaps an expendable
non-official middleman will be designated to take a gentle fall,
helping Janet Reno to avoid having to seek independent counsel. And
the relieved Clinton will owe Jiang a big one.
</P>
<P>
   In light of his personal negotiating difficulty, and recognizing
the need for the U.S. to exchange summit visits with a major power,
what can we reasonably ask our president to do?
</P>
<P>
   1. Before leaving for Beijing, stop claiming that all critics
seek only to ``isolate'' a billion people. Clinton's tired
straw-man argument insults both human-rights activists and
hard-line strategists, and such divisive defensiveness only invites
a countercharge of appeasement and fans suspicions of collusion.
</P>
<P>
   2. On arrival, don't waste your mandatory human-rights message
on the accompanying press corps. Instead, insist on making it a
major theme of your live broadcast-telecast to the Chinese people,
and be sure the interpreter is our man. Meet and be photographed
with authentic dissidents and offer to host a White House meeting
between Jiang and the Dalai Lama.
</P>
<P>
   3. In negotiations, deal with verification of promises to
curtail the spread of nukes and missiles; don't try to con the
world with a phony p.r. stunt of ``re-targeting'' missiles. We all
know they can be aimed again at U.S. cities within 10 minutes _ and
now much more accurately, thanks to the victory of Clinton Commerce
and the big donors over the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   4. Surface the concern in our intelligence community with
experiments in China to gain the ability to combat our ``critical
infrastructure.'' A brigade of official hackers with the mission of
destroying our computer communications and satellites is even more
worrisome than a beachhead in Long Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   5. Try financial jujitsu. When China threatened to devalue its
yuan unless the U.S. and Japan bolstered the yen, the U.S. jumped
to do Beijing's bidding. Now Clinton should heap praise on Chinese
``economic stability'' _ making it harder for China to devalue when
the pressure in Japan builds again.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, let Jiang know that the next U.S. president might not
be so vulnerable to revelations of Chinese manipulation, and will
not forget any advantage taken of this one.

INTERLEAGUE PLAY A HIT WITH FANS, NOT PLAYERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Designated hitters, wild cards, night games at
Wrigley, ownership by conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball convention has been turned on its ear, but the game
continues to thrive _ in spite of, or precisely because of, these
innovations.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next four nights in Southern California, a clamorous
statement will be made for the continuance of still another
wrinkle: interleague play.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be that the area's fans could harbor only the
faintest hope of a Freeway World Series between the Dodgers and
Angels. During the first 36 years of these teams' co-tenancy of the
region, it never had the slightest glimmer of fruition.
</P>
<P>
   But interleague play, launched as a two-year experiment last
season, delivered the next best thing: games between the Dodgers
and Angels that actually meant something. And the fans responded
about as expected.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next four nights, the teams will participate in a
home-and-home exchange _ two games in Anaheim, beginning tonight,
followed by two in Dodger Stadium _ and officials from both clubs
say they are expecting robust crowds throughout.
</P>
<P>
   For the game's players, who will vote later this summer on
whether to continue interleague play, it presents an unmistakable
message: This thing is good for business.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a player, I don't like it,'' said veteran relief pitcher
Mark Guthrie of the Dodgers. ``But if it sells seats, I guess
you've got to like it.''
</P>
<P>
   It does, indeed, sell tickets. Throughout the major leagues,
last year's interleague games represented a 20 percent attendance
boost over the averages for intraleague play. This season's first,
brief burst of interleague action, two weeks ago, reflected hikes
of 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, the numbers last year were dramatic. The Angels
averaged 20,953 for American League games and 29,152 for six
interleague contests (a 39 percent increase), and for two home
games with the Dodgers they logged their largest and fourth-largest
gatherings of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers drew an average of 40,320 for National League games
and 47,019 for eight interleague dates (a 17 percent boost). They
actually drew better for Seattle, Texas and Oakland than they did
for the Angels, but their average for two games with the Angels
(43,691) certainly wasn't shabby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like it,'' Dodgers executive vice president Fred Claire said
of interleague play. ``It obviously has added a very interesting
and exciting dimension to our game....
</P>
<P>
   ``It did create the two-game series, which was absolutely brutal
for everybody. The concept is there, but there is work to be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   The work will involve convincing players that this innovation
can be retained without turning travel schedules inside-out.
``We've got to cut it down to where we're not playing two-game
series every time we go out on the road,'' said Angels first
baseman Cecil Fielder. ``That is very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   The number of miniseries has been reduced _ the Angels have 17
this year, as opposed to 26 last year; the Dodgers have 12 this
year, compared with 25 in '97 _ but the issue remains a serious
stumbling block for the players' approval, said union chief Donald
Fehr.
</P>
<P>
   Some players, as a result, take a nihilist view of the future of
interleague play. ``I've talked to a lot of players, and nobody
likes it,'' said St. Louis' Mark McGwire. ``I don't see it being
passed.''
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball, however, feels it will soon allay the
concerns over fractured travel itineraries. ``We'll have a schedule
to the union by the first of July,'' said spokesman Richard Levin.
``I think that schedule will reflect fewer two-game series by a
considerable amount. I think it will satisfy those concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, baseball mulls over additional modifications to
interleague play, some of which could be reflected in the new
schedule.
</P>
<P>
   One option, which could drastically reduce the number of
two-game series, would involve teams facing a limited number of
teams from an opposing division. In the west, for example, the
Dodgers might play only Seattle and the Angels one time around, and
catch Oakland and Texas in the next season.
</P>
<P>
   Another would involve a rotating, three-year tour of the
interleague divisions: West one year, East the next, Central the
next.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you've got to mix up the divisions,'' said Colorado's
Dante Bichette, whose team has no natural regional rival. ``If we
see Anaheim and Seattle every year, that's going to get old. I'm
sure the fans (in Denver) would like to see the New York Yankees.
Then it kind of remains fresh. If it gets old, the fans will stop
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite its popularity, interleague play is certain to generate
its share of controversy. If the Chicago Cubs and San Francisco
Giants are pursuing the same wild card, for example, an argument
likely will arise that the Cubs are facing much weaker opponents in
the AL Central than are the Giants in the AL West.
</P>
<P>
   But if baseball elects to continue on this course, it will
simply have to weather the interleague quirks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the owners and the union are feeling it's a good thing
_ not a good thing for us, but a good thing for the fans,'' said
Fielder.
</P>
<P>
   Added Angels player representative Tim Salmon: ``I look at it
from a standpoint that you always wonder what it's like to play
some of these National League teams.... I like it. It kind of makes
things exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially when the exhilaration has civic undertones, as will
be the case this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets back, to me, to the feel of what Pacific Coast League
games used to be like _ the Angels and the Hollywood Stars,'' said
the Dodgers' Claire, referring to the Triple-A days in Los Angeles
before the Dodgers moved here from Brooklyn 40 years ago. ``It's
great. I know the players feel it. It's an added dimension of
excitement.''
</P>
<P>
   And, by all indications, another breath of fresh air for
baseball.

IRAN KNOCKS U.S. OUT OF WORLD CUP COMPETITION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LYON, France _ The Iranian players shook hands with the
Americans before Sunday night's game, handed them white flowers
symbolizing peace and even posed together for a group picture. But
friendship extended only so far. There was a soccer game to win,
and not only did Iran prevail, 2-1, it also knocked the United
States out of the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   If the outcome was unexpected by many, so was the political
component of the match. A vigorous protest was launched not against
the Great Satan, but rather against Iran's own Islamic regime.
Thousands of middle-class Iranian expatriates smuggled T-shirts
into Gerland Stadium showing the pictures of two leaders of a
Paris-based opposition group called the National Council of
Resistance.
</P>
<P>
   French police rushed into the stands several times to confiscate
banners and pictures celebrating the two dissident leaders, but new
banners and pictures kept popping up like mushrooms. The opposition
group's influence is considered to be limited inside Iran, but the
size of the protest was undoubtedly an embarrassment to the Islamic
regime.
</P>
<P>
   In the game's most surreal moment, the protesters waved their
T-shirts and banners jubilantly at halftime as the public-address
system played the Macarena. About 75 French policemen in riot gear
marched to one side of the field 10 minutes before the game
concluded, but the Iranian fans left peacefully and ecstatically.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time that Iran and the United States had met
in soccer competition and the first time that Iran ever won a game
in two trips to the World Cup. The countries exchanged visits by
their Olympic-style wrestling teams this year, and have
participated in the Summer Olympic Games, but this was the most
visible head-to-head sporting event between the two countries since
the Islamic revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   The match was played several days after President Clinton called
for reconciliation with Iran after 19 years of enmity between the
two countries, and it followed a call in January by President
Mohammad Khatami of Iran for cultural exchanges between the two
countries. In victory on Sunday night, Iranian players said it was
significant to have defeated the Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is important after 20 years of situations to show
that the things said about Iranians are not true,'' said Ahmad
Abedzadeh, the Iranian goalkeeper. ``We were courageous and we
played fair. That is very important.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tehran, thousands of celebrating fans took to the streets,
some of them women without their scarves, despite efforts by the
Islamic regime to make sure that the celebration was not as
vociferous as it had been last November when Iran qualified for the
World Cup for the first time in 20 years. Political experts said
that the conservative clerics who hold power in Iran were
threatened by the joyful outburst of the people last fall, which
they could not control.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, restaurants in Tehran were forced to close at 9
p.m., plans to show the game on giant outdoor television screens
were canceled and anti-riot police and plainclothes police set up
roadblocks around the city to make sure that the celebration was
not too forceful. Still, the Iranian players said they knew the
ordinary people of Iran would be exultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the greatest game we ever played,'' said star forward
Khodadad Azizi. ``The whole nation was waiting for this game and
expecting us to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as dissidents did, Iran's conservative religious leaders
attempted to use the victory for political purposes. Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei, Iran's supreme leader, said in a statement broadcast by
state television that ``Tonight, again, the strong and arrogant
opponent felt the bitter taste of defeat at your hands.''
</P>
<P>
   While Iran (1-1) is sure to have its hopes of advancing to the
second round dashed on Thursday when it faces powerful Germany, at
least it can dream. The United States (0-2) will now play a
meaningless game on Thursday against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans cannot match their accomplishment in 1994 of
having advanced to the second round. Given their generally poor
play and inability to put the ball into the net, the 1998 World Cup
will have to be regarded as a complete failure. Alan Rothenberg,
president of the U.S. Soccer Federation, called Sunday night's
defeat a ``bitter disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   If the United States was a serious soccer country, Coach Steve
Sampson might have lost his job on Sunday night, as coaches from
Saudi Arabia and South Korea did in recent days. But Rothenberg
said Sampson would coach the team against Yugoslavia. Sampson made
five lineup changes on Sunday night, scrapping the 3-6-1 formation
for a 3-5-2 with Brian McBride and Roy Wegerle at forwards and Tab
Ramos, Frankie Hejduk and Joe-Max Moore assuming roles in midfield.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson wanted assertive play after Monday's tentative loss to
Germany, and on Sunday night the Americans hit the goalpost twice
and the crossbar once, but they could not score a goal. In fact,
they came forward so aggressively and took so many risks that they
were left completely out of shape on defense.
</P>
<P>
   In the 40th minute, with Claudio Reyna giving him far too much
room, Iran's Hamid Estili headed a ball over the head of American
goalkeeper Kasey Keller to give his team a 1-0 lead. As the crowd
of 35,500, made largely of Iranian fans, erupted, Estili kissed the
ground in celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Six minutes from the game's conclusion, Mehdi Mahdavikia
sprinted past the disheveled American defense and blasted another
goal past Keller. McBride provided an inconsequential goal on a
header for the Americans in the 87th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson faced stern questions about why he kept Eric Wynalda,
the Americans' all-time leading scorer on the bench, but he said,
``I wouldn't change a thing.''

HISTORIC CANNERY ROW DEALS WITH CRUSH OF SUCCESS
</HEADLINE>

 By NINA SIEGAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTEREY, Calif. _ When the novelist John Steinbeck was
searching for a storytelling method to capture the essence of life
on Cannery Row _ ``the poem and the stink and the grating noise _
the quality of light, the tone, the habit and the dream'' _ in the
early 1940s, he looked at the way marine biologists collected sea
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain flat worms so delicate that they are almost
impossible to capture whole, for they break and tatter under the
touch,'' he wrote in the introduction to his novel, ``Cannery
Row.'' ``You must let them ooze and crawl of their own will onto a
knife blade and then lift them gently into your bottle of sea
water.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, as about 2 million tourists each year bustle down the
mile-long stretch of seafood bars, candy stores and souvenir shops
that line the historic row, any such fragile grub would be unlikely
to slither its way into open air on its own.
</P>
<P>
   The noise of honky-tonks, whorehouses, crowded groceries,
saloons and flophouses has long been replaced by the sound of
cameras taking pictures, the laughter of children and the din of
construction jackhammers. Where sardine fishing and canning once
supplied a vibrant economy, tourism now pulls in 50 percent of the
city's annual revenue.
</P>
<P>
   It is the very success of Monterey's flourishing tourist
industry, supported in large part by the Monterey Bay Aquarium,
that concerns literary buffs and preservationists. They say that
new development, including a four-story shopping plaza planned for
the center of the row, threatens the last vestiges of the old life.
</P>
<P>
   On June 15, the National Trust for Historic Preservation agreed,
and named Cannery Row as one of the nation's 11 most-endangered
historic places. The National Trust is a private nonprofit
organization headquartered in Washington that was chartered by
Congress to monitor historic sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cannery Row illustrates the dangers that arise from tourism
and development,'' said Courtney Damkroger, assistant director of
the western regional office of the preservation agency. ``It is a
successful tourist district, but you don't want to lose the very
thing that draws people to the place in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the preservation agency has no enforcement powers,
Monterey city leaders were dismayed by the designation. ``We feel
like we've been wounded in a sense,'' Mayor Dan Albert said.
``We've worked so hard down there and spent so much money to
preserve it. Can we do more? Of course we can, but there are lots
of other things we need to do. That's not the sole focus of the
city.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert said the city recently purchased Doc Rickett's Lab, which
appears in Steinbeck's book and is one of two historically
designated buildings on the row, for $400,000. He said the city
also spent nearly $2 million to make the new aquarium maintain the
aesthetic feel of a cannery that once stood in its place. In
addition, Albert said the city plans to add markers to point out
important buildings throughout the row, and has begun a survey of
81 structures in the area to determine if they are historical.
</P>
<P>
   Although the city does not own much of the property on the row,
Albert said that officials are trying to balance conservation
efforts with private property interests by offering tax incentives
to developers to preserve the existing structures or to design
buildings that retain the texture of the old canning district.
</P>
<P>
   Cannery Row first came to the attention of the National Trust
for Historic Preservation last year, during a battle over the fate
of the San Xavier Warehouse, one of the few remaining buildings
with a direct link to the canning industry. City officials deemed
it a safety hazard, and property owners wanted it gone, but local
preservationists held firm. In the end, the city ordered property
owners not to demolish the warehouse, but to take it apart piece by
piece so that parts of it could be re-used in construction.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by the city's planning process during the battle,
Neal Hotelling, one of the preservationists, nominated Cannery Row
for National Trust's annual listing of endangered places.
</P>
<P>
   Hotelling wants the city to zone Cannery Row as a historic
district, so that new construction would be considered against the
historic value of existing structures. He would also like to see
several of the large empty lots on the row filled with new
buildings, to bring back the original sense of the row _ a long
continuous strip of businesses along the seaside.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he and other preservationists want to save
several important structures from demolition. One is Stohan's
Gallery, a small arts and crafts gallery built in the 1940s as a
fish-processing plant, which was bought by developers last year.
</P>
<P>
   Daryl Stokes, 48, who ran Stohan's for 20 years before he was
evicted last October to make way for development, said that in that
time he has seen about 40 percent of the strip replaced with new
development.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of buildings sat here for so many years and were allowed
to deteriorate,'' Stokes said. ``At the same time there was more
focus on new development than in preserving the old buildings,
because there was more monetary incentive in it. It's sad, because
there are thousands of people who come here every year, and they
want to see what Steinbeck saw.''

MARION JONES WINS THREE NATIONAL TITLES
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By FRANK LITSKY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ It was a coronation, but don't tell Marion Jones.
</P>
<P>
   On another blazing, draining day, with the temperature 98
degrees in the stands and 114 on the track, Jones, a 22-year-old
Californian, won her third national title in two days as the U.S.
outdoor track and field championships ended Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Jones won the 100 meters and the long jump on Saturday night and
the 200 meters Sunday. In the 200, she downshifted in the last 15
meters and still won by 6 meters in 22.24 seconds into a slight
wind.
</P>
<P>
   Then she smiled, relieved that she had completed the first
100-200-long jump triple in women's competition in the nationals
since Stella Walsh did it 50 years ago. In men's competition, the
last to do it was Carl Lewis in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after the 200, Jones was asked if she considered herself
the world's best female athlete. She recoiled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely don't deserve that title yet,'' she said. ``I
still consider Jackie the best and probably will till the end of my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackie is Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who has won Olympic gold medals
in the heptathlon and the long jump. She did not compete here but
plans to be in the Goodwill Games next month in Uniondale, N.Y.
Jones will be there, too, in the 100 and 200.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy and relieved,'' Jones said after her 200. ``It took
a lot of energy. My legs were a little tired and I was exhausted.
I'm happy it's over and that I did it. But I'm not going to do it
again, not this year.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was voted the outstanding female athlete of the
championships. The men's honor went to John Godina, who on Saturday
night completed the men's first discus throw-shot-put double in 43
years.
</P>
<P>
   The best performance of the meet came Sunday afternoon before a
crowd of 6,826 at Tad Gormley Stadium. Bryan Bronson, a 25-year-old
Rice graduate, won the men's 400-meter hurdles by 6 meters in 47.03
seconds. That was the fastest ever on American soil and the third
fastest in history behind Kevin Young's 46.78 in 1992 and Edwin
Moses' 47.02 in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was ready,'' Bronson said, ``but I didn't think I
would run that fast. As I was coming down the stretch, I was
watching the clock. When I saw it say 46, I hammered it. If the
world record doesn't come this year, I've still had a great year.''
</P>
<P>
   In a meet limited to U.S. citizens, Bronson and three others ran
the fastest times in the world this year. The others were Kim
Batten in the women's 400-meter hurdles (53.61 seconds), Jerome
Young in the men's 400-meter dash (44.09 seconds) and Reggie Torian
in the men's 110-meter hurdles (13.03 seconds). Young, a surprise
winner, is a junior at St. Augustine's, a Division II college in
Raleigh, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Batten won her race for the fifth consecutive year, Connie
Price-Smith won the women's shot-put for the seventh straight year
(61 feet 3 inches) and Charles Austin won the men's high jump for
the fourth straight year (7-6{).
</P>
<P>
   But even the winners struggled with the intense heat and
humidity. As Austin said: ``You try to prevent cramping by loading
up on liquids. But you drink so much that it gets to your stomach
and sits there.''
</P>
<P>
   Suzy Hamilton, who had last won a national title in 1991, showed
great closing speed in winning the women's 1,500 meters by 14
meters in 4 minutes 5.28 seconds, the fastest time by an American
this year. But that did not exempt her from distress, she said,
because ``everyone is suffering like everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   The heat slowed the distance runners throughout the meet.
Sunday, Pascal Dobert won the men's 3,000-meter steeplechase in
8:33.91, the slowest winning time since 1979. But for athletes like
Dobert, trying to move up to the big time, winning was enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``My whole goal was to win,'' he said. ``I don't care about the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   While many young athletes made their marks over the three days,
some older ones did all right, too. Take the men's 800-meter final,
which Mark Everett had won six times in the 10 previous years and
Johnny Gray six times in the 13 previous years. This time, the
29-year-old Everett beat his 38-year-old rival by 4 feet in
1:45.28. Gray's perpetual smile remained.
</P>
<P>
   ``At my age,'' he said, ``it's great to still have an
opportunity to do this.''

AL CAMPANIS, 81, BASEBALL EXECUTIVE WHO SPARKED FUROR ON RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Al Campanis, the Los Angeles Dodgers executive who touched off a
furor _ and shattered his career _ by suggesting that blacks were
unqualified for high-level baseball jobs, died at home Sunday of
coronary artery disease. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   When the first pitch of the 1987 season was thrown, few outside
the world of baseball knew the name Al Campanis. But by the
following day, he had become a symbol of racial insensitivity and
had unintentionally coined a buzzword in the debate over
opportunities for minority-group members _ the term
``necessities.''
</P>
<P>
   It was April 6, baseball's opening day. Ted Koppel's
``Nightline'' program on ABC was marking the 40th anniversary of
Jackie Robinson's breaking the major-league color barrier with the
Brooklyn Dodgers. What better way to remember Robinson than to
speak with Campanis, a longtime executive of the franchise that had
defied decades of baseball bigotry to sign him?
</P>
<P>
   Campanis could look back on 44 years in the Dodgers'
organization. A native of Greece brought to New York City as a
youngster by his mother, he graduated from New York University,
served in the Navy and then embarked on a long and successful
tenure in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief infield stint with Brooklyn in 1943, he had played
shortstop for the Montreal Royals in 1946 when Robinson broke into
organized baseball as the Dodgers farm team's second baseman.
</P>
<P>
   Campanis once recalled how he had thrown his glove down and
challenged a base runner to do battle after the player tried to
rough up Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Campanis managed in the Dodgers' farm system, served as
scouting director, followed the team from Brooklyn to Los Angeles
and, beginning in 1968, had been vice president of player
personnel. He brought Sandy Koufax and Fernando Valenzuela to the
Dodgers and oversaw decisions that shaped one of baseball's most
successful teams.
</P>
<P>
   And Campanis was known as a ``Rickey man,'' a disciple of the
Dodgers executive hailed as a civil-rights pioneer for signing
Robinson. Campanis treasured a tape recording of a 1950 talk by
Branch Rickey discoursing on baseball and on life.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, nearly four decades later, Campanis turned to
Rickey's thoughts for guidance, having transcribed those recordings
to cassette tapes he kept in battered blue and white shoe boxes.
</P>
<P>
   When he interviewed Campanis, Koppel put nostalgia aside. He
asked him why baseball had no black managers, general managers or
owners and suggested that the answer was prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   Campanis replied: ``No, I don't believe it's prejudice. I truly
believe that they may not have some of the necessities to be, let's
say, a field manager or perhaps a general manager.''
</P>
<P>
   Koppel, taken aback, gave Campanis another chance, asking, ``Do
you really believe that?''
</P>
<P>
   Campanis responded: ``Well, I don't say that all of them, but
they certainly are short. How many quarterbacks do you have, how
many pitchers do you have that are black?''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Campanis became ensnarled in athletic musculature while
trying to make a point, remarking: ``Why are black men or black
people not good swimmers? Because they don't have the buoyancy.''
</P>
<P>
   After a commercial break, Koppel _ pronouncing himself
``flabbergasted'' by Campanis' remarks _ gave him an opportunity to
``dig yourself out.''
</P>
<P>
   But Campanis was digging his own professional grave. ``I have
never said that blacks are not intelligent,'' he told Koppel. ``I
think many of them are highly intelligent. But they may not have
the desire to be in the front office.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``But they're outstanding athletes, very God-gifted,
and they're wonderful people.''
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after Campanis began speaking, the phones at ABC started
ringing, with viewers denouncing him for racist statements. The
next day, Robinson's widow, Rachel, Hank Aaron and baseball
commissioner Peter Ueberroth expressed dismay.
</P>
<P>
   The evening after the broadcast, Campanis denied believing that
blacks lacked the ability to hold management positions and
apologized ``to the American people and particularly to all black
Americans for my statement and my inability, under the
circumstances, to express accurately my beliefs.''
</P>
<P>
   Campanis added, ``This is the saddest moment of my career.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also the end of his career. The next day, Dodgers owner
Peter O'Malley sought and received Campanis' resignation.
``Everybody knows I'm not prejudiced,'' Campanis said in departing.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Claire, a longtime Dodgers employee, replaced Campanis.
</P>
<P>
   ``His was a life full of love for the game and his family,''
Claire told ABC Sports on Sunday. ``No one loved baseball more than
Al loved the game. He was a great student of the game and a great
teacher of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Campanis is survived by his sons, George and Jim, who caught for
the Dodgers, Kansas City and Pittsburgh, five grandchildren and
three great-grandchildren.

   In the aftermath of the Campanis furor, Ueberroth was prompted
to make hiring of minority-group members in baseball a priority.
Major League Baseball created an affirmative-action program and
hired Harry Edwards, a black sociology professor at the University
of California, to identify black and Hispanic former players who
could work in baseball.

   Within two years, Bill White, who is black, was appointed
National League president. But after an initial surge in
minority-group hiring after Campanis' dismissal, the gains were
minimal.

   Campanis faded from view after his resignation. But when sports
figures like broadcaster Jimmy ``the Greek'' Snyder, Cincinnati
Reds owner Marge Schott and golfer Fuzzy Zoeller made racially
offensive remarks, Al Campanis and ``necessities'' were recalled.

STARR AIDE CALLED TOUGH, `ATTACK DOG' LAWYER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After her testimony in the grand jury room, Gloria
Cabe was left with a memory of such prosecutorial zeal in the
performance of Jackie Bennett Jr. that four years later she still
finds it chilling for its unfettered aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was shouting, telling me I was a liar and everybody in the
room knew I was a liar,'' said Ms. Cabe, board counselor for the
Export Import Bank. She was recalling her summons to the Whitewater
grand jury when Bennett was delving into Bill Clinton's Arkansas
years and proving himself as the right-hand man of Kenneth Starr,
the independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bennett's style is the meanest attack dog that I've ever seen
displayed in any professional setting,'' added Ms. Cabe, not a
target of the investigation and speaking from the perspective of
scar-toughened years in the Arkansas Legislature and several
Clinton campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   But one witness's grand-jury attack dog can be his fellow
prosecutors' champion thoroughbred in the noir world of
public-integrity indictment and prosecution _ gunning for
politicians and public officials, in laymen's parlance.
</P>
<P>
   Now, still fervidly on the president's case as it veers into
Clinton's behavior at the White House, Bennett suddenly finds
himself a lightning rod for anti-Starr critics and an embattled
stalwart to his career colleagues in the Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jackie always handled the most difficult witnesses in
Arkansas, the ones who'd rather eat ground glass than testify''
said Ray Jahn, an assistant U.S. attorney in west Texas and a close
friend who worked on Whitewater with Bennett. ``He's an old
football player, you know, and his style is to get down there on
the line and root it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Jahn's wife, LeRoy, his partner for 25 years in a federal
prosecution team and a close friend of Bennett, said they often
discussed their common joy as corruption fighters, a singular
calling that many lawyers eventually leave for the more lucrative
field of criminal defense. ``The same thing keeps Jackie and us
doing it,'' she explained. ``You get to do the right things for the
right reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics are raising ethical questions about Bennett's role as
broker, one openly confirmed by Starr, in dealing with news media
interested in learning investigation secrets. At the same time,
supporters are counting on Bennett to break the logjam in the
Monica Lewinsky case in leading negotiations with her new lawyers
for a possible deal on testifying about her relationship with
President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and colleagues of Bennett, 41, insist he is only as
tough as he must be to do the right job. He is no mere eminence
grise in Starr's investigation of the president, they insist, but
rather a canny, multifaceted court performer exhilarated by his job
and, they maintain, as fair as he has to be.
</P>
<P>
   This image of Jackie Bennett as more subtle than blunt is hard
for his latest adversaries at the White House to believe as they
watch him run a team of unyielding prosecutors here before the
federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how he is with others, but he acts like he's
sitting in the owner's box in there,'' said Sidney Blumenthal, the
president's communications coordinator, describing the arenalike
setting of the grand jury room where Blumenthal has been summoned
repeatedly in the Lewinsky inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other prosecutors sitting down from him ask the questions,
but he gets agitated sometimes and scribbles questions for them to
ask,'' Blumenthal said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is his ballfield,'' Blumenthal said warily of the grand
jury setting, ``and Bennett's clearly volatile.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett relies on good-cop, bad-cop skills honed in 13 years in
the courtrooms and back rooms of prosecution. Physically and
professionally imposing _ his position was offensive tackle at
Hanover College in Indiana _ Bennett is a laureate prosecutor with
a booming voice, a standout in the dicey specialty of routing out
corrupt politicians.
</P>
<P>
   He won the attorney general's John Marshall Award as the top
federal prosecutor of 1994 for convicting Albert Bustamante, a
former representative from Texas, of racketeering and bribery, a
victory that has inspired a certain sharp-edged respect among
professional politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy is tough and really comes after you,'' said Jack
Pytel, a San Antonio lawyer and former prosecutor who faced Bennett
five years ago in a campaign corruption trial of prominent
Democratic contributors. ``If you take him head on, he respects
you,'' said Pytel, who won the case. ``But if Bennett intimidates
you, you're lost.''
</P>
<P>
   In that trial, Judge Lucius Bunton of U.S. District Court
tongue-lashed the prosecution for a ``witch hunt'' agenda and a
``rinky-dink'' case. Bennett's defenders, underlining the
guerrilla-war intensity of west Texas politics, contended the judge
was a Democratic appointee trying Democrats, even as the judge
called him an ``overzealous prosecutor.''
</P>
<P>
   His Texas foray, made as senior trial lawyer in the Justice
Department's public-integrity section, was just the fiery foundry
that Bennett needed for his job as Starr's deputy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say it was a great training ground given the fact that Ken
Starr seems hellbent on pushing every button,'' said Gerry
Goldstein, a San Antonio defense lawyer still angry about the
``bullying'' way he said Bennett wields his grand jury power.
``It's an arrogance of power,'' Goldstein said. ``He takes the
letter of the law and pushes it to the edge where it serves him,
but when a citizen gets into a gray area he doesn't mind slapping
down hard.''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bennett's friends and enemies agree he is no mere table-thumper
as he bores in before a grand jury or trial jury. ``In Arkansas,
witnesses were very tough,'' recalled Eric Jaso, a New York lawyer
who worked with Bennett on Whitewater trials. ``And Jackie was the
perfect guy. He could manhandle in cross-examination if that was
required, but then he could get folksy enough to make a guy laugh
and ease the courtroom mood.''
</P>
<P>
   In asking one reluctant witness whether he had been deceived by
a Whitewater defendant, Bennett softened his edge and finally got
the answer he sought by laconically putting the question this way:
``He kind of rolled your pants leg up on that one, didn't he?''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett can be no less disarming socially. He and his wife,
Cindy, have four sons, ages 1 to 8, and their family became a
centerpiece of sorts in the temporary encampment of the Whitewater
teams in Little Rock. Friends prized a relaxed barbecue with the
Bennetts after a long day of tracking Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, who did not respond to a request for an interview, has
told close friends that withstanding the heat is simply part of a
job he still loves. ``I was talking with him the other night,''
said Jahn, ``and reminded him of the motto we used over and over in
Arkansas when critics were beating up on us. `You're honored by
your friends and distinguished by your enemies.' Jackie laughed and
said he's been saying it all the time lately.''

IBM BEGINS MAKING FAST, CHEAPER CHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Without fanfare but with potentially far-reaching significance
for the semiconductor industry, IBM has begun the industry's first
large-scale production of a type of chip that may reduce prices and
improve performance and portability for cellular phones and other
wireless communications devices.
</P>
<P>
   The chips are based on technology developed by IBM Corp. in the
early 1980s for mainframe computers and redirected toward consumer
products. It combines the standard silicon used throughout the chip
industry with germanium, a metallic element that is so efficient a
conductor of electricity that it may reduce the power consumption
of portable devices as much as 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The use of germanium, which is relatively easy for chip makers
to work with and is well suited to the electronics of
high-frequency radio communications, enabled IBM engineers to
combine wireless communications components and silicon digital
transistors on a single chip.
</P>
<P>
   By consolidating equipment and capabilities that typically
require several chips or components, makers of cellular telephones
and other consumer products can reduce the size and complexity of
those products. Industry experts say it may eventually be possible
to create the entire electronics of a cellular phone on a single
chip.
</P>
<P>
   Other applications may include home receivers for
direct-broadcast satellite television and various kinds of portable
devices for wireless connections to the Internet. Many analysts
also expect silicon germanium chips, because of their high-speed
processing ability, to play a key role in future network-switching
equipment for routing all sorts of Internet traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``IBM is assembling the technologies that will allow it to
pounce on the communications industry,'' said Dan Hutcheson,
president of VLSI Technologies of San Jose, Calif., a market
research firm.
</P>
<P>
   The components market into which IBM will be selling the chips
is now estimated at $540 million a year, but the company predicted
that its own piece of the market would exceed $1 billion annually
within five years.
</P>
<P>
   Initial customers for the IBM chips, which the company began
producing in large quantities last week at an updated plant in
Burlington, Vt., are Hughes Electronics, Harris Semiconductor,
National Semiconductor, Northern Telecom and Tektronix. All five
companies have also licensed IBM's technology to incorporate into
their own product designs. IBM said it had two dozen additional
customers, which it was not yet ready to identify.
</P>
<P>
   Although IBM declined to discuss pricing for the new chips,
industry analysts estimated that it might sell for $10 and replace
a cluster of components now costing as much as $100.
</P>
<P>
   The higher-performance, lower-priced chips may also pave the way
for ``soft radios,'' the industry's emerging term for a new type of
cellular phone that could use software to conform automatically to
whatever format and frequency the local cellular system employed.
Such a phone, in theory at least, could be used in any region of
the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Holy Grail for the cellular telephone industry,''
said Lawrence Larson, a professor of electrical engineering at the
University of California at San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Further in the future may lie more speculative but potentially
vast markets for applications like collision-avoidance radar for
automobiles. Such systems, long considered impractical because of
cost, may be within the reach of inexpensive
silicon-germanium-based devices.
</P>
<P>
   The components of the IBM chip that are based on germanium
involve analog technology _ meaning that they convert sound, light
or physical motion into electrical patterns analogous to the
original source. Analog chips are required in digital devices like
cellular phones to convert the human voice into an electronic
signal that a digital chip can translate into the binary-code data
of ones and zeroes used in modern communications networks.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's breakthrough involved, in essence, combining the germanium
analog conversion device with standard silicon digital transistors
on a single chip.
</P>
<P>
   IBM executives say that as many as 50 other companies are
pursuing similar technology, but industry analysts agree that IBM
has taken a clear lead in silicon germanium chips.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``They've found their way around a lot of obstacles,'' said Fred
Zieber, president of Pathfinder Research Inc., a San Jose, Calif.,
market research firm.
</P>
<P>
   IBM executives predict that silicon germanium will put new
competitive pressure on the current market for several exotic
semiconductor technologies, including gallium arsenide.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, gallium arsenide has been the most promising material
for extremely high-speed computing and communications applications.
But semiconductors based on it have been expensive and difficult to
manufacture, confining its use mainly to high-performance computing
and limited consumer applications.
</P>
<P>
   Initial versions of IBM's silicon germanium technology were
developed in the early 1980s by Bernard Meyerson and other
scientists at the company's T.J. Watson Research Laboratory in
Yorktown Heights, N.Y., who were seeking a way to speed the
performance of mainframe computers.
</P>
<P>
   By the early '90s, though, IBM had altered the technology course
of its mainframes, basing them instead on an inexpensive chip
process known as CMOS, for complementary metal oxide semiconductor.
</P>
<P>
   So Meyerson and his team redirected their silicon germanium work
toward a new class of chips that would combine all the functions of
analog communications equipment and digital computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could say this was a failed mainframe technology,'' said
Paul Horn, senior vice president for research at the Watson
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers had long known that by adding tiny amounts of
germanium to silicon, it would be possible to achieve notable
increases in the speed at which transistors direct, or switch,
electrons through a chip's circuitry. Because of differences in the
sizes of silicon and germanium atoms, however, semiconductors made
from composites of the two materials typically failed.
</P>
<P>
   Meyerson's solution was to find a relatively low-temperature
technique for creating a thin film of germanium that could be
successfully bonded to silicon.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a semiconductor manufacturing process that
combined the benefits of low-cost silicon and ultra-high-speed
germanium.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're able to achieve is speed without scaling down the
size of the transistors,'' Meyerson said. ``That translates into
added speed without cost.''

 &HT;    Janzen squeaks by Stewart in U.S. Open
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Maybe this is why Lee Janzen had downplayed the
potential depression when a sickening Sunday 79 had cost him The
Players Championship in March. Maybe this is why he had more
respect for his year than the statistics had shown.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday at The Olympic Club, the 33-year-old Janzen earned a
giant award for both hard work and good faith. Capitalizing on an
off day by his Orlando neighbor, Payne Stewart, Janzen shot a
2-under-par 68 to win his second U.S. Open by one shot at even-par
280.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who was trying for a wire-to-wire win, stumbled to a
4-over 74 and finished at 281. His chance to tie Janzen and force a
playoff Monday came and went at the 18th hole, when downhill
20-footer try for birdie slipped a few inches below the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Janzen trailed by seven shots after three holes Sunday, with
bogeys on No. 2 and No. 3, but played solidly down the stretch,
birdieing the 13th and then parring in. When Stewart's putt missed,
he broke into tears with wife Beverly.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was a dream to win the U.S. Open (in 1993) and not a day
has gone by that I haven't thought about winning it again,'' said
Janzen, fighting through tears during the ceremony at the 18th
green. ''It's been a while since I've won (three times in 1995) and
there are times when you ask yourself 'Can I win? Will I win
again?' You keep telling yourself, 'When I do, it's going to erase
all the bad Sundays, all the missed cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   A par at the difficult 17th was a key for Janzen after making
two bogeys and a double-bogey there in previous rounds. Janzen
fired his shot to the 18th over the flag, then cautiously eased a
bending 20-footer to within three feet, and made it for par.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, 41, the 1991 champion, said flatly, ''The credit's got
to go to Lee. He goes out in the third to last group and he shoots
68. I didn't play good enough to win today and I got beat by an
outstanding round of golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Janzen, who won the 1993 U.S. Open at Baltusrol _ by two strokes
over Stewart _ started the sunny, cool day five strokes behind the
man in the plus-fours. . In the event of a Stewart collapse, Janzen
was not the most logical choice to step up and take over. It
clearly was Tom Lehman, who played in the final group for the
fourth straight year, but again walked away without the major he so
desires. Lehman stomached a 75 and tied for fifth, six shots behind
Janzen.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia Tech U.S. Amateur champion Matt Kuchar concluded with a
74 and tied for 14th at 9-over 289, earning a return trip to next
year's Open at Pinehurst.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a higher goal really,'' said Kuchar, who turned 20
Sunday while his father Peter, his caddie, celebrated Father's Day.
''I really wanted to see how high on the leaderboard I could get.
...It's an honor just to be here, just being associated with these
guys. You kind of play up to the level of your competition.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Marietta, Ga. player Bob Tway finished third with a 73 at
284, a stroke ahead of Nick Price, who had a 73 for 285.

EDITORIAL: ECHOES OF EL SALVADOR IN COLOMBIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, June 22:
</P>
<P>
   Washington's growing involvement in a brutal Latin American
guerrilla war echoes the opening stages of American intervention in
the conflict in El Salvador in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Diana Jean Schemo and Tim Golden reported in The Times earlier
this month that much of the aid the Pentagon is giving Colombia's
military to fight cocaine is being used instead to fight
guerrillas. American special-forces trainers now work in Colombia,
teaching the military such skills as jungle maneuvering and
psychological operations. While the level of support is far below
American aid to the Salvadoran military in the 1980s, the
administration is unwisely considering an increase.
</P>
<P>
   As in El Salvador, American aid is going to an abusive and inept
army fighting vicious Marxist guerrillas. The guerrillas kill
politicians and kidnap Americans. The military has strong ties to
paramilitary death squads, which massacre peasants and murder human
rights workers and left-wing politicians. Last year, 10 people a
day died in political murders. Seventy percent of the killings were
attributed to soldiers or paramilitaries.
</P>
<P>
   Support for the army also undermines Colombia's precarious
civilian institutions. The military is defying a constitutional
court ruling to reform its justice system. Generals have openly
refused to obey presidential orders relating to peace.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of increased military aid and training, who mainly
work in the Pentagon, contend that Colombia's soldiers need light
infantry training and equipment and other skills that can be used
against any foe. They and the White House drug office call the
insurgents ``narco-guerrillas'' and argue that the battles against
drugs and against guerrillas cannot be separated. But training will
take years to make a difference, and Colombia's military has often
rejected useful advice in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The narco-guerrilla connection is disputed by many in the
Colombian government and the American State Department, who call it
a label invented by the Colombian military to allow them to use the
aid to fight guerrillas. Myles Frechette, the American ambassador
to Colombia until the end of 1997, publicly criticized the term,
and American intelligence services in 1996 concluded that the term
was far overblown. Ironically, there may be strong ties between the
paramilitaries and the traffickers. Colombia's investigative police
say Carlos Castano, a top paramilitary leader, heads a drug cartel.
</P>
<P>
   As in El Salvador, peace talks are the only solution to a civil
war neither side can win. Colombians overwhelmingly endorsed talks
in a referendum last year, both candidates in the presidential
runoff election backed them, and previously recalcitrant guerrillas
are showing interest. Washington can best support the talks by
terminating its aid to a military that has undermined them. &QL;

EDITORIAL: VOTE ON HORMEL
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, June 22:
</P>
<P>
   James Hormel, President Clinton's nominee to be ambassador to
Luxembourg, is opposed by a small group of Republican senators who
are looking smaller all the time.
</P>
<P>
   It is not Hormel's credentials that are in question. An heir to
the Hormel meat-packing fortune, a former dean of the University of
Chicago Law School, he has given leadership and money to causes
that range from the San Francisco Symphony to Swarthmore College
and the Human Rights Campaign, the main political lobby for
homosexual rights.
</P>
<P>
   Hormel is gay, but that is not an issue in Luxembourg. As
Alphonse Berns, Luxembourg's ambassador to the United States, said
on Friday, ``We would welcome Hormel.'' But for months, Sens. James
Inhofe of Oklahoma, Tim Hutchinson of Arkansas and Robert Smith of
New Hampshire have been blocking a vote on the nomination, making
dark suggestions about Hormel's gay-rights ``agenda,'' as if he
might somehow seek to lead the moral standards of Luxembourg
astray.
</P>
<P>
   Discrimination against people on the basis of their sexual
orientation is outlawed in Luxembourg and in all the other
countries in the European Union. It is illegal in San Francisco,
where Hormel lives, and in Washington _ except in such places as
Congress, where the Republican leadership has made a fetish of it
lately.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, who has
refused to bring the Hormel nomination up for a vote, said in a
television interview that he thought homosexuality was a sin. He
likened it to alcoholism, kleptomania and ``sex addiction.'' The
next day, Dick Armey, the House majority leader, said he thought it
was a sin too, and cited some Bible scripture to the effect that
neither fornicators, nor adulterers, ``nor effeminate, nor abusers
of themselves with mankind'' shall inherit the kingdom of God.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in a letter to Lott made public on Thursday, Sen.
Alfonse D'Amato of New York broke the silence of his fellow
Republicans to say that it was wrong to block Hormel's nomination
simply because he is gay. ``I am embarrassed,'' he said. Sen.
Dianne Feinstein of California has said she believes more than 60
senators support Hormel. Lott should let the nomination go to the
floor, so Hormel can be judged on his merit.

 &HT;    First Winston Cup win for Mayfield in Pocono

<TEXT>
<P>
   POCONO, Pa. _ With a lump in his throat and Jeff Gordon on his
rear bumper, Jeremy Mayfield beat down every challenge Sunday and
put victory No. 1 in his Winston Cup scrapbook.

   The 29-year-old native of Owensboro, Ky. took the lead from his
hometown hero, Darrell Waltrip, on lap 180, and then had to hold
off Gordon over the final 21 laps, winning by a scant 0.341
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ''Me and him (Michael Kranefuss) are pretty emotional about
this,'' Mayfield said of himself and Kranefuss, who owns 50 percent
of the team. ''We ain't showing it. We're trying to be tough right
now and hold on like it's a big deal. But, I guarantee you one of
these days we're gonna show it.''
</P>
<P>
   It was prophetic that that it would be Mayfield who went to
Victory Lane before teammate Rusty Wallace. Wallace lasted only 13
laps, victimized by a blown engine.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hate it for Rusty,'' Mayfield said. ''He had a car as good
as mine - same motors, same type setups, everything. I knew we had
a shot at it. I've never been here and had any bad luck.''
</P>
<P>
   He had considerable good luck this week. He won $111,580,
including a $40,000 bonus from Winston for winning the race and
leading the Winston Cup points. With his victory, he increased his
points lead to 36 over second place Gordon and is 48 in front of
Jarrett.
</P>
<P>
   He dominated this one, leading five times for 122 of the 200
laps. Only Dale Jarrett and Gordon led more than once under green
for a total of 43 laps. He was never more than 12th on restarts or
in harm's way during the nine cautions for 47 laps.
</P>
<P>
   ''They did just a perfect job, and he did such a good job there
with Jeff Gordon right on his tale,'' Jarrett said. ''I can't tell
you what a remarkable job he did.''

AZINGER SHOOTS OPEN-LOW 65
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It was too little too late for Paul Azinger, who
carded the lowest score of this year's U.S. Open in relative
obscurity Sunday. His 5-under-par 65 was one shot better than Payne
Stewart's first-round effort, but all it got Azinger was a return
invitation to next year's event at Pinehurst, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Azinger's round featured eight birdies and only 25 putts, the
last of which was a curling 30-footer on the 18th hole that he
couldn't believe dropped. When his ball disappeared in the cup,
Azinger dropped his putter and raised his hands to the heavens. ``A
miracle,'' is what he called it.
</P>
<P>
   Before teeing off in the third group of the day, Azinger called
his score, correctly as it turned out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was talking about a 65,'' Azinger said. ``It was kind of a
fluke that I got it.''
</P>
<P>
   Azinger's score was seven shots better than the best he could
muster the first three days, begging the question: Was the course
playing easier Sunday or was his collar just looser? Nerves,
Azinger said, what nerves?
</P>
<P>
   ``You've been listening to (golfer and outspoken TV announcer)
Johnny Miller,'' Azinger said with a smirk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was swinging better today,'' he said. ``I had better timing,
better rhythm.''
</P>
<P>
   Azinger's subpar round was one of six recorded Sunday. Of those,
only winner Lee Janzen's 68 came from any of the final 13 twosomes.
</P>
<P>
   Coulda shoulda: Tiger Woods, the 1997 Masters champion,
effectively plugged his title hopes at the par-4 second, par-3
third and par-4 fourth holes at the Olympic Club's Lake Course.
</P>
<P>
   Woods, 22, covered those 1,055 yards of high-end real estate in
a combined 8-over-par, which looms large considering he finished at
plus-10 after a closing round of 73 that included a three-putt
bogey at No.18.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made good swings,'' Woods said. ``But the balls would land
in the fairway and end up in the deep rough.''
</P>
<P>
   That wasn't really Woods' problem on the second and fourth holes
as he hit five of eight fairways. But when he got to the greens, it
was another story. He two-putted the two holes seven times out of
eight.
</P>
<P>
   Woods might talk around it _ whistling through the graveyard, as
it were _ but his putting clearly is killing him; for the week he
required 33, 32, 30 and 31 putts, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit a lot of lips that didn't go in,'' Woods said. ``I just
missed some putts. The greens were spongy and bouncy. That was a
problem for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin unimpressed: By way of comparison, Woods' onetime
Stanford teammate Casey Martin played holes No. 2, 3 and 4 in
3-over par en route to impressing everyone, it seems, except
himself. He closed with a 72 to finish in a tie for 23rd at plus-11
in his first U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who was born with a rare circulatory disorder in his
right leg that makes walking painful, became the first golfer to
use a cart in a U.S. Open. But he'd rather you remember him as a
player, not a pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot more game than I showed,'' said Martin, who
narrowly missed qualifying for the PGA Tour in December and is a
regular on the minitour sponsored by Nike. ``I realize I can play
with these guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Happy birthday: Amateur Matt Kuchar gave himself a great 20th-
birthday present, draining a long par putt on the 72nd hole that
was as good as an RSVP to next year's Open. The putt capped a 74
that gave Kuchar a four-day total of 9-over-par and a share of 14th
place with Azinger, Jesper Parnevik and Jim Furyk. The top 15 and
ties automatically receive return invitations.
</P>
<P>
   Kuchar's finish was the best by an amateur since Jim Simons' tie
for fifth in 1971.

   They are both students from Congo who fled to the United States,
certain they would have been killed in the political turmoil at
home. Bakam Mimpongo, 21, was caught at New York's Kennedy
International Airport, trying to enter with fake papers. Bisinwa
Borumbi, 22, stowed away in a cargo ship and was seized in
Jacksonville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Each gave similar accounts of persecution, of paramilitary
groups and rebels ravaging villages and taking prisoners, of their
desperate need for asylum.
</P>
<P>
   But in the United States, their paths have sharply diverged. Ms.
Mimpongo spent five months and 10 days in a federal detention
center in New York City last year before being granted asylum.
Borumbi, detained in Miami in February of this year, was freed on
parole after three weeks, but his case has not yet been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration lawyers and advocates for refugees point to the
different treatment of cases like these as a sign that federal
immigration laws are applied unevenly throughout the nation.
Important decisions _ from how long it takes to review an asylum
seeker's case to whether he or she is quickly paroled or detained
for months _ seem to hinge more on the number of beds available at
a detention center than on a cohesive national policy.
</P>
<P>
   Since April 1, 1997, when a new law took effect, the Immigration
and Naturalization Service has detained all asylum seekers upon
arrival and subjected them to a procedure called ``expedited
removal.'' The law denies asylum seekers full hearings with legal
representation and the right to federal appeals unless they can
quickly convince immigration officials that they have a ``credible
fear'' of persecution in their homeland. Those found to have no
``significant possibility'' of winning asylum are swiftly deported.
</P>
<P>
   Those whose claims are found plausible can be freed on parole.
The law specifies, however, that parole is to be granted only on a
case-by-case basis and only for ``urgent humanitarian reasons or
significant public benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   But since Congress never defined ``urgent humanitarian
reasons,'' the INS has allowed its 33 district directors to
exercise their discretion in deciding whether to keep detainees
behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress has raised the bar as to who can be paroled, making
it more difficult to justify releasing someone from detention,'' an
INS spokesman in Washington, Russell Bergeron, said. ``And what's
urgent and humanitarian for one district director may not be so for
another.''
</P>
<P>
   The inconsistencies in granting parole are dizzying, said
Charles Wheeler, who monitors the cases of asylum seekers
nationwide as the supervisor of the detention project at the
Catholic Legal Immigration Network, a private advocacy group in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In El Paso, Texas, he said, many asylum seekers have to post
bond before being paroled. In Los Angeles and New Jersey, asylum
seekers are usually released, but only if family members will
sponsor them. In Miami, virtually everyone is released. In New
York, virtually no one is.
</P>
<P>
   ``If, in fact, this law was conceived to send a strong message
abroad that the United States was getting tough on immigration,''
Wheeler said, ``then the message ought to be a consistent one.
Right now the message is: If you come through Miami, you are OK,
but don't come to New York. You'll be stuck in detention.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A recently released study and interviews with more than a dozen
lawyers and their clients confirm Wheeler's findings. While some
asylum seekers are allowed to argue their cases shortly after
arrival, others languish in detention for months, sometimes
surrounded by convicted criminals in county jails. Some are
released after posting bond as low as $5,000, or simply by
providing the address where they plan to reside.
</P>
<P>
   While some women with children are released immediately, others
are held for months, separated from their children. Lawyers said
that clients with identical cases might be treated differently from
one month to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration lawyers and advocates for refugees say that these
irregularities are an especially urgent issue now because the
swiftness of deportations under the new law makes the need for a
good, timely defense more critical than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Under the old law, people who requested asylum were allowed to
stay in the country while their cases were heard by immigration
judges. If the judges ruled against them, they could appeal to the
Board of Immigration Appeals and then the federal courts, a process
that could take a year or more.
</P>
<P>
   Now, detainees are under pressure to prepare a compelling case
quickly _ and lawyers say this is a difficult task for people
behind bars. Instead of freely searching for lawyers and preparing
their cases, detainees who do not speak English or know the laws of
the United States must often wait for lawyers to spot them and
visit them at detention centers, usually out-of-the-way places that
resemble jails and afford little privacy.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way of knowing precisely how many people have been
affected adversely by the law, because the federal government does
not keep statistics of how many people who go through the new
procedures are denied asylum. But asylum seekers are always a tiny
percentage of the hundreds of thousands people who seek entry into
the United States every year.
</P>
<P>
   From August of last year through the end of January, for
example, 1,300 new arrivals expressed a fear to return home. Of
those, 1,066 were sent to detention centers; the rest were
deported.
</P>
<P>
   ``How we treat asylum seekers is a reflection of who we are as a
nation,'' said Leonard Glickman, executive vice president at the
Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society in New York City, the group that
helped Ms. Mimpongo win her case. ``The law was not just for the
benefit of the country. It was also supposed to help those who
needed help. That's where we have fallen short.''
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   The irregularities in the process _ and the fact that much of it
remains closed to public scrutiny _ have led members of Congress to
call for a study of the ways the INS deals with asylum seekers. The
bill directs the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees to study
whether immigration officers in the United States are ``detaining
such aliens improperly or in inappropriate conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have heard many complaints, and we are concerned,'' said
Elizabeth Kessler, general counsel of the Senate's immigration
subcommittee, whose chairman is Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich. ``We
do have a federal law, and it should be interpreted the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials in Washington said they would welcome such
a study.
</P>
<P>
   A report released in May _ the first independent study of the
new procedure _ indicates that the number of days asylum seekers
remain in detention is higher in New York than anywhere else in the
nation. The study, prepared by the International Human Rights and
Migration Project of the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at
Santa Clara University in California, revealed that by the time the
study ended, the average number of days in detention for detainees
in New York was 92, while for detainees in San Francisco the
average was 44 and for those in Miami it was 62. The INS has
dismissed the study as ``flawed.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Musalo, a co-director of the study, said that asylum
seekers _ sometimes mothers and their children _ are routinely kept
in detention in New York for months until a judge hears their case.
</P>
<P>
   That is what happened to Sivajini Kadambarathnam, 35, and her
13-year-old son, Rajakumar. The two were stopped on March 12, upon
arrival at Kennedy Airport without documents from Sri Lanka, and
ordered detained, her immigration records show. But because no
children are allowed in the Queens detention center, Rajakumar was
sent to a center for juveniles in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cried and cried and cried,'' said Mrs. Kadambarathnam, who
fled her country after her husband was taken away by the military
last year. ``But then they put handcuffs on me and that shut me up.
No one had ever done that to me before.''
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials said they were willing to release the boy,
but not the mother, to sponsors. But the sponsor would not take the
boy by himself, so the two remained in detention but separated, one
of her lawyers, Eileen Collins Bretz, said. Mrs. Kadambarathnam was
granted political asylum and released June 2, after nearly three
months in detention. Her son had been released a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, where the influx of Haitian and Central American
immigrants seldom lets up, the Krome detention center routinely
releases asylum seekers who can show they have a place to stay,
said Stacey Taeuber, a pro-bono lawyer who works with detainees.
The policy was different last year: to be released on parole,
asylum seekers needed to post a $5,000 bond.
</P>
<P>
   One of Ms. Taeuber's clients was Gabriel Jaime Castano, 28, a
Colombian immigrant who said he had no intention of seeking
political asylum when he arrived at Miami International Airport in
January with a visitor's visa. A farmer from near Medellin, Castano
said he had gone to Miami to escape his country's violence for a
few weeks. He was tired of paying off both the army and the
guerrillas _ with 20 live chickens a month _ to stay alive, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officers detained him because they did not believe
he intended only to visit, Castano said. After consulting with
lawyers there, he said he realized that asking for political asylum
would get him out of detention faster than sticking to his original
claim.
</P>
<P>
   That tactic would probably not have worked in New York. When the
Wackenhut detention center fills up, asylum seekers are sent to a
detention center in Elizabeth, N.J., or to the York County Prison,
in York, Pa., said Mark Thorn, a spokesman from the INS office in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Epstein, a spokeswoman from the Hebrew Immigrant Aid
Society, said that one of the agency's clients _ a 20-year-old
woman from Ghana who has been detained for seven months _ was
recently transferred to Pennsylvania. The woman, Swaibatu Mohammed,
told the agency that five other women were moved with her.
</P>
<P>
   In years to come, the INS intends to detain even more people as
it builds more detention facilities, said Bergeron. In doing so, he
said, the agency would be following the mandate of Congress, which
since 1996 has allocated $205.3 million to add 7,364 spaces to the
agency's current detention capacity and 882 positions to its
payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the INS has 15,000 beds in nine detention facilities,
prisons and an array of local jails around the country, an 80
percent increase from the number of beds available just three years
ago. Yet, Bergeron said, to accommodate all the people the law
mandates be detained _ those who seek entry into the United States
with no papers or with fraudulent documents _ the agency will have
to double its current detention capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time now,'' Bergeron said, ``we have both the
statutory mandate to detain them and the space to hold them.''

   TEHRAN, Iran _ In a high-stakes political battle filled with
recriminations and rage, Iran's Parliament voted Sunday to dismiss
one of the closest allies of Mohammad Khatami, the reform-minded
president.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami swiftly retaliated. He made Abdullah Noori, the ousted
minister of the interior, a vice president.
</P>
<P>
   Parliament is controlled by Khatami's enemies. Its action Sunday
is the most serious political setback to his presidency since his
landslide victory 13 months ago as well as graphic proof of
Khatami's limited room for maneuver in Iran's Islamic Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The vote came just three days after Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright warmly praised Khatami and the direction in which he seems
to be taking the country, and she held out the prospect of eventual
normalization of relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, 137-117 with 11 abstentions, came in a secret ballot
after several hours of impassioned debate in which Noori was
accused of arrogantly dismissing officials who did not share his
politics, fostering an unstable economic environment and putting
the country's security at risk.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was as much an attack against Khatami as it was against
Noori, and it is part of a wider campaign led by conservative
members of the clergy to discredit officials loyal to the
president.
</P>
<P>
   The parliamentary session was broadcast live on radio and later
on television as millions of Iranian viewers were awaiting the live
broadcast of the World Cup soccer match between the United States
and Iran at 11:30 p.m. Both opponents and supporters of Noori
stepped up to the lectern in the center of the modest parliamentary
hall to air their views.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the current trend continues, the result will be something
like Lebanon of a few years ago, or Yugoslavia,'' said Mohammad
Reza Bahonar, a deputy speaker of Parliament, predicting partition
of the country. ``Mr. Noori's attitude is dangerous to the
political future of the country.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In another angry speech, Marzieh Vahid-Dastjerdi, an
obstetrician and representative from Tehran who was dressed in the
traditional black chador, accused Noori of replacing 1,700
officials, primarily because they ``were not thinking like you.''
She also attacked Noori's definition of freedom, saying, ``For us,
freedom doesn't mean that counterrevolutionary groups can do
whatever they want and create anarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   In support of Noori, Majid Ansari, a member of Parliament from
Tehran, accused the minister's enemies of exaggerating Iran's
troubles as if ``Iran is on the verge of war.''
</P>
<P>
   Noori sat stone-faced during the speeches before offering a
defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not claim I never made a mistake,'' he said. But he
accused his enemies of a plot to alienate Iran's young people from
the true meaning of the  &QL; 
Islamic revolution and the clergy.
</P>
<P>
   Noori was reflecting the position voiced repeatedly by Khatami
and his supporters that what is at stake is nothing less than the
soul of the nation. According to this line of thinking, unless Iran
becomes freer at home and more open to the outside world, it will
lose the allegiance of the generation that has been born in the 19
years since the monarchy was overthrown.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami has therefore committed himself to the creation of a
``civil society'' and the ``rule of law'' at home and has reached
out to improve relations with both the Arab world and the West.
</P>
<P>
   But Khatami is fiercely opposed by those clerics _ and their
followers _ who believe that the core beliefs of the revolution are
being sacrificed.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Parliament does not give me the vote of confidence, I will
thank God that he has lifted this heavy responsibility from my
shoulders, and I will see this as God's mercy,'' Noori said in his
speech. ``And if I get the vote of confidence, I will be energized
once again.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Whether Abdullah Noori remains or not, until the
last second of my life I will remain the servant of the system, the
revolution and the leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of Parliament cast white ballots to dismiss Noori,
purple ballots to keep him and yellow ballots to abstain. Then Ali
Akbar Nateq-Noori, the Speaker of Parliament, announced in sober
tones, `` Abdullah Noori failed to win a vote of confidence.''
Several of the members shouted, ``God is great!''
</P>
<P>
   Nateq-Noori had been the front-runner for president and lost in
an upset to Khatami.
</P>
<P>
   Although Khatami acknowledged that Parliament had the right
under the Constitution to dismiss Noori, he reiterated his
determination to give the people the freedoms they hold under the
law. ``I and my administration are very serious about this
principle,'' he said. ``Of course, it has costs which must be paid,
just like building a bridge or a factory.''
</P>
<P>
   In introducing the dismissal motion last month, 31 members of
Parliament accused Noori of ``creating tension in society, giving
provocative interviews and speeches in different provinces and
appointing inexperienced people to managerial posts in the
ministry.''
</P>
<P>
   Noori, 49, a mid-ranking cleric from Isfahan, has been an
outspoken proponent of Khatami's commitment to impose a rule of law
and has come under fire for issuing permits to allow groups to
conduct peaceful demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Under the constitution, the country's spiritual leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and not the president, controls the
judiciary, as well as the military, radio and television and the
intelligence and security services.
</P>
<P>
   But Khatami has encouraged Noori to challenge decisions by the
judiciary _ particularly the arrest of Tehran Mayor Gholamhossein
Karabaschi, who is on trial on corruption and embezzlement charges.
The trial is broadcast on television in the evenings.
</P>
<P>
   Noori has also strongly supported Karabaschi and has openly
criticized the chief of the judiciary, Ayatollah Mohammed Yazdi,
for arresting the mayor in April without telling Noori.
</P>
<P>
   He said at the time, ``When the mayor of Tehran, who is a member
of the Cabinet, is arrested without informing the interior minister
or even the president and some public media resort to
rumor-mongering; when the mayor, with all his experience, is
prevented from having any visitors and an arrest warrant that is
totally inconsistent with the charges is issued for him; when
propaganda campaigns against the mayor and his colleagues are
launched for several consecutive months from every side and he
remains silent, like a wronged person, in the interest of the
state, what hope can an ordinary citizen have that the law will
defend his rights?''
</P>
<P>
   After several thousand people demonstrated in favor of the
mayor, he was released on bail.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, Khatami defended Noori, calling him ``one of the
strongest ministers in the Cabinet.'' The President predicted that
Noori's ``absence from the Cabinet will entail massive damage for
the government and the country.''
</P>
<P>
   In a direct affront to Parliament, Khatami on Sunday cited
Noori's ``capabilities'' and created a job for him: vice president
for development and social affairs. The job keeps Noori in the
Cabinet and does not require Parliament's approval.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign that he had no intention of surrendering to
Parliament, Khatami appointed Mostafa Tajzadeh, a deputy minister
of the interior, as the acting minister. Tajzadeh, a staunch
supporter of the president, was also criticized Sunday by some
members of Parliament.

DEFEAT IS APOLITICAL AS YANKS LOSE TO IRAN 2-1
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LYONS, France _ When Americans and Iranians exchange gifts and
mingle on the field for an unusual mass photograph before the game,
the emphasis should not be on embarrassment. The players made the
gestures of good will, so why torture the American players by
talking of national humiliation?
</P>
<P>
   Iran beat the United States, 2-1, in a soccer game Sunday night.
This is a big shock only if one is caught up in the history between
the two nations. Actually, the United States was essentially an
innocent bystander in all the political maneuvering Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The action in the stands involved thousands of Iranian exiles
wearing T-shirts supporting an opposition movement, and trying to
wave banners. This was not a case of Iran against the Great Satan
in the stands, nor was it that way on the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   There was no political zealousness in the eyes of the Iranian
players on the field, no holy mission in their faces or their
actions. In fact, they came out tentatively.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the first few minutes, we were pummeling them,''
said Cobi Jones, one of the American regulars.
</P>
<P>
   People back home in the United States might expect one-sidedness
in basketball, the way Charles Barkley toyed with the Angolans in
the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, but this is soccer, not the
first or second or third American sport of choice. The Yanks were
neither opportunistic nor intelligent nor lucky Sunday night, and
now they have no chance to advance in this World Cup, which is a
setback from 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranians played hard, and they caught a few breaks on the
goalkeeper's best friend, the perpendicular bars that stopped three
American shots. Any way you look at it, the Iranians won a World
Cup game for the first time in the nation's history, and people
celebrated in the streets of Lyons.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the people celebrating were exiles, people who had left
Iran for one reason or another and are now making their way quite
nicely in this materialistic world. They could afford the air fares
and the hotel bills and the street ticket prices to get into this
game and wear T-shirts protesting the current Iranian regime. And
when the ball went in the net two times, the expatriates celebrated
along with their Iranian brothers and sisters back home. The
victory united them. Underdogs always cheer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you lose to a Germany, you can keep your head up, because
everybody loses to Germany,'' said Kasey Keller, the United States'
world-level goalkeeper. ``This is very frustrating, but there have
been times when we were not the better team, and we won.''
</P>
<P>
   For all that, the Yanks knew they were losing a historic game,
and falling right out of contention, like South Korea and Saudi
Arabia before them. In the past day, those two nations dismissed
their coaches with a game to play. There will be no such
shenanigans from the American soccer federation, but it is clear
that the Steve Sampson era will end after the Yugoslavia game on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Agonizing and heartbroken,'' is the way Alan Rothenberg
described his mood as the game got away. He has been the head of
the soccer federation for eight years, ran an excellent World Cup
in 1994, and now he squirmed in his seat as the Americans could not
connect.
</P>
<P>
   A new lineup, new combinations, old guys, unproven guys,
questionable squad cuts, mass benchings of old reliables _ all of
this set a mood under Sampson these past couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, Iran rushed on the attack, and Hamid Estili
flicked an artful header into the corner of the goal, outjumping
Tab Ramos, all of 5 feet 7 inches, and Claudio Reyna, 5-10, neither
of whom is a defender.
</P>
<P>
   Going into this World Cup, the operative theory was that height
would play a big part in the Iran game, but here was a 5-9 player
matched against two of the smaller Yanks who should normally not
have been back there defending the goal in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive scramble was symptomatic of a team with little
character or leadership. The Iranians played hard and they played
resourcefully, and when it was over, they sought out the Americans
for the normal sporting gestures. One Iranian player walked half
the length of the field to muss the hair of Reyna, who was
obviously stunned. Several players exchanged shirts on the field,
an open sign of sporting acceptance by two nations that have had
their differences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I exchanged a shirt right on the field,'' Ernie Stewart said.
``I've got a good collection back home.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the gestures will lead to warmer relations between the
nations. For the Americans, the shirts will be a memento of a
historic loss that will hurt for a long time, not for the politics,
but for the end of hope.

 &HT;    Quietly, Janzen slips into victory
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ While nobody was looking. While all attention
was on a pair two twosomes ahead. While those who ride darkhorses
were saddling up Tom Lehman. While the old Olympic Club course
stood firm in defense of its harsh reputation. Lee Janzen slipped
in the side door and won the U.S. Open. Payne Stewart had held the
lead for three days, and the lead in a U.S. Open can become a heavy
load.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Watson had predicted the winning score would be over par. He
was close. All Janzen had to do was shoot even par for 72 holes,
two rounds of 73 to go with 66 Friday and a closing 68, one of only
five rounds under par Sunday. Of all the names on the leaderboard,
only three showed gains for the day, Janzen, the champion, Jeff
Sluman with a 68 and David Duval with a 69.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard today, hard the day before, hard the day before
that,'' Duval said. The Georgia Tech alum finished tied for 7th
with Lee Westwood, the English player, and Jeff Maggert, noted for
never finishing off a run.
</P>
<P>
   This is Janzen's second Open championship, and the fellow he
thwarted was the same fellow he thwarted at Baltusrol in 1993.
Stewart had a putting chance on the last green, 25 feet downhill on
the slippery 18th. Eleven years ago, when Scott Simpson won here,
Watson left a 25-foot uphill putt two inches short. This time,
Stewart's putt drifted three inches below the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't play well enough to win,'' Stewart said. It was
an honest summation of a tawdry day on this rugged course, playing
to par of 70. ``I'll still be Payne Stewart tomorrow, and life goes
on.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you stopped to consider how this is going to affect your
legacy?'' he was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Legacy?'' he repeated. ``I didn't know I had one.''
</P>
<P>
   He wears plus-fours, flat caps, startling colors and chews gum.
He lights up the horizon. Janzen is a fellow of placid appearance,
makes no waves, stirs no emotions. He has been a solid, steady
player since he first hit the PGA Tour in 1990, a rookie out of
Florida Southern College. He came out of Minnesota, lived awhile in
Maryland, now lives in the same area as Stewart in the Orlando
area.
</P>
<P>
   This was the eighth tournament he has won, and makes up by a
whopping lot for a couple that got away this year. He made a
serious run in The Players Championship and faded, had the lead in
Houston and dropped out of sight. He hadn't won since the Sprint
International three years ago. He has made a more than average
contribution to U.S. Open history. When he beat Stewart at
Baltusrol, his score of 272 tied the championship record that Jack
Nicklaus has set there in 1980. It still stands.
</P>
<P>
   He admitted he started out without winning in mind. ``Just play
good golf,'' which he didn't. By the third hole, after two bogeys,
he was already seven strokes behind. Another time one of his shots
stuck in a tree and he was on the way back to reload when it fell.
He turned even par, then picked up the strokes he needed on the
11th and 13th, while Stewart was shooting himself in the foot.
</P>
<P>
   Olympic has a habit of delivering champions from out of the
ranks. An obscure Jack Fleck won a playoff from Ben Hogan in 1955.
Bill Casper beat Arnold Palmer in 1963 and Simpson's winning set
off no national celebrations. So Janzen sat there looking about as
surprised as anybody, surely as thankful as those just happy to
have a winner rather than a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a great golf course,'' he said, sitting beside
and admiring his new silver trophy. Meanwhile, Tiger Woods gave it
the back of his hand, ``fairways baked out,'' ``greens bouncy,''
hardest he'd ever played. It's all in the eyes of the scorer. He
finished 10 strokes behind Janzen.

COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT'S ACCUSER HANDILY WINS PRESIDENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia _ With horns blaring and banners fluttering
from car windows, Colombians voted a resounding end on Sunday to
the scandal-ridden presidency of Ernesto Samper, electing as his
successor the man who first accused Samper of accepting money from
drug dealers.
</P>
<P>
   The election of Andres Pastrana, the Conservative former mayor
of Bogota, over Horacio Serpa of the Liberal Party, Samper's
interior minister and most loyal advocate, opens a new chapter in
Colombia's relations with the United States, which have boiled over
with bitterness and suspicion during Samper's four years in power.
</P>
<P>
   With more than 96 percent of the vote counted, Pastrana had won
50.3 percent of the vote, to 46.25 percent for Serpa.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country clearly came out to vote for change,'' Pastrana
said.
</P>
<P>
   The unusually strong showing of Pastrana _ who won a higher
number of votes than any previously elected president _ and a high
turnout came in sharp contrast to public opinion surveys, all of
which had shown the two candidates virtually tied for the
presidency and had predicted a low voter turnout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a rejection of all the negative things the country has
been living through for the last four years _ the government
policies, unemployment, corruption, and a style of politics that's
very tied to patronage,'' said Rodrigo Losada, a political
scientist at Javeriana University.
</P>
<P>
   Alfredo Rangel, a former national security adviser who confessed
to being ``absolutely surprised'' by the results, agreed. ``The
Liberal Party political machine couldn't pull it off,'' he said.
``And it was mobilized to the maximum.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangel predicted that relations with the United States would
improve dramatically with Sunday's election of Pastrana, probably
entering a new era of closeness and cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Serpa, in defending Samper, had frequently lashed out publicly
against U.S. officials, at one point calling the former U.S.
ambassador here, Myles Frechette, ``the crazy gringo.''
</P>
<P>
   Serpa conceded defeat on Sunday night, saying, ``I congratulate
Andres Pastrana for his election as Colombia's next president, and
I call on all my fellow countrymen to support him and accompany him
in the difficult task he faces.
</P>
<P>
   Under Samper, who was acused of accepting $6 million from drug
dealers in his election campaign and who was stripped of his U.S.
visa two years ago, U.S. officials cultivated ties with other
individuals or agencies _ like the chief of police, Gen. Rosso Jose
Serrano _ while largely avoiding direct encounters with the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very definitively, voters punished the Samper government,''
said Rangel. ``It's an overwhelming rejection of continuity.''
</P>
<P>
   While Pastrana may enjoy strong electoral backing, the Congress
here remains heavily Liberal. Ingrid Betancur, a Liberal deputy who
has been supporting Pastrana's candidacy, said that Pastrana would
probably seek a public referendum to elect a new Congress as part
of an overall drive for political reform if he could not govern
with the current Congress.
</P>
<P>
   As president elect, Pastrana's first order of business is
expected to be a direct meeting with the leader of the largest
rebel group that has been battling government security forces for
more than 30 years, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. He
pledges to hold such as meeting as early as next week if security
permits.
</P>
<P>
   The two candidates' potential ability to negotiate an end to the
civil conflict that has claimed more than 30,000 lives in Colombia
was, along with the economy, a top issue in the campaign. With the
strong support of Colombia's business community and his
Conservative credentials unquestioned by the military, Pastrana
appears to have wide latitude for tackling the country's most
difficult problems.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In the final days of campaigning, Pastrana had pledged to meet
with Manuel Marulanda, the rebel leader, who had already met with
Pastrana's campaign chief the week before.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel leader allowed the release of a photo of himself
talking with Pastrana's campaign manager, in what appeared to be a
silent endorsement of the Conservative candidate. That move struck
at the heart of Serpa's claim to be the candidate most capable of
negotiating peace talks, and it increased Pastrana's standing among
voters weary of the intractable civil conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana has pledged to lead negotiations personally with the
leftist rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia and
with the smaller National Liberation Army and has agreed to a
guerrilla demand that government security forces evacuate five
municipalities during any peace negotiations. He has pledged
separate parallel talks with right-wing paramilitary leaders, who
have been demanding a say in any peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana has not ruled out a settlement that would incorporate
the rebels into the government, allowing them political control of
areas they already control on the ground. Under such an agreement,
the government would eventually end fumigation of drug crops,
holding the rebels responsible for eliminating drug crops in their
areas. Pastrana has proposed an international aid plan to support
alternative development in coca growing regions as well.
</P>
<P>
   The mood in Bogota was festive and energetic on Sunday, with
cars festooned with posters and stickers for the candidates
careening through down the avenues and taking over street corners.
Youngsters painted their faces in the red, blue and yellow of the
Colombian flag and waved flags from car windows.
</P>
<P>
   At scattered stoplights around the city, the supporters for
Pastrana exhorted drivers to vote for their candidate, while across
the street, supporters of Serpa shouted the praises of their man.
</P>
<P>
   In Bogota, those encounters were free of violence. But in the
countryside, scattered fighting between guerrillas and government
security forces was reported.
</P>
<P>
   At polling places from the working class district of South
Candelaria to the toney outdoor polling stations in northern
Bogota, voters appeared divided, and none too pleased with either
of the candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Ramirez, a 46-year-old businessman, stood with his dog
outside the room where he would vote. He said he could not decide
for whom to vote and listed his country's troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence, mismanagement, bad administration,'' he said. ``The
corruption of the upper classes, which is poisoning our country day
by day. There are things the country cannot forget.'' But later, he
said he decided to vote for Serpa, faulting Pastrana for his poor
performance as mayor of Bogota from 1988 to 1990.
</P>
<P>
   In the poorer neighborhoods, Pastrana, the son of former
President Misael Pastrana, was frequently resented for his
political pedigree, while Serpa was embraced for having risen above
his working class background in the oil port of Barrancabermeja.
But those aspiring to the middle class, holding management jobs or
owning their own businesses, appeared to favor Pastrana.
</P>
<P>
   Epaminondas Navarrete, who said he has been working for 48 of
his 56 years, said both candidates made grand promises, but Serpa's
pledge to shrink the work week to 40 hours from 48 as a means of
combatting unemployment would hurt his business. Navarrete, who
runs a car assembly plant, noted that Pastrana proposes tax breaks
to stimulate hiring. ``I don't know which one to believe, but I
think I believe Pastrana more than Serpa,'' he said.

WHAT A WAY TO GO OUT _ LOSING TO IRAN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LYON, France _ They never saw themselves going out this way. Not
with a whistle blowing and scarlet-clad Iranians leaping off the
bench and hugging and kissing and weeping and thanking the heavens.
Not with one match left to play. Not two-and-out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years,'' midfielder Cobi Jones said Sunday night after a
2-1 loss to Iran knocked the US soccer team out of the World Cup
before most of the world even knew they were here. ``And it's over
in a week.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans knew they had no chance of winning this
quadrennial kickball tournament. The London oddsmakers had them at
150-1, down with the rest of the ``minnows.'' Their own federation
president said before they even crossed the Atlantic that it was
unrealistic to expect the US to make it to the second round.
</P>
<P>
   But two-and-out? Never. ``We figured we could get a point
against Germany,'' midfielder Tab Ramos was saying, as his
blazer-clad mates filed past him, tight-lipped and red-eyed, to the
bus. ``We figured we could get three points against Iran. Then we'd
play Yugoslavia and see what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, when less was expected, the Yanks had
overachieved. They had made it to the second round and lost by one
goal to eventual champion Brazil. The draw was tougher this time
and they were playing overseas and yet ...
</P>
<P>
   They never thought they would lose last night. Iran had not been
to a World Cup in 20 years. The sport had gone moribund there for
nearly a decade after the Islamic revolution and during the war
with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranians had needed a miracle even to qualify. They had been
through three coaches since November. They had lost by six goals
last month to Rome's club team, which was only supposed to be a
sparring partner. They did not expect to win a match here. All the
Iranians hoped for was to lose with honor. ``If we die,'' coach
Jalal Talebi said, after they'd lost their opener to Yugoslavia,
``we die standing.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Americans ever thought it would be easy. They knew
how much beating Uncle Sam meant back in Tehran. They knew the
Iranians would play themselves into the ground. But the Americans
thought that if they loaded their lineup with attackers and kept
coming, coming, coming, they would win.
</P>
<P>
   So they came with guns blazing. They controlled the ball for 34
minutes, 20 of them in the attacking zone. They took 27 shots.
Brian McBride hit the crossbar. Claudio Reyna hit the right post.
David Regis hit the left post. Frankie Hejduk nearly blew a hole
through the keeper's gut from sawed-off shotgun range. Nothing. Not
until 87 of the 90 minutes had ticked down and Iran was already up
by two goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how we didn't win that game,'' Ramos said, shaking
his head. ``I don't remember a game with so many chances and
scoring just one goal. The ball just didn't want to go in the back
of the net.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't for lack of audacity, or lack of sweat. ``We did what
we set out to do,'' coach Steve Sampson said. ``Attack and get
behind them. We played to win.''
</P>
<P>
   It came down, the Iranians agreed, to the bounce of the ball.
``You deserved to be a winner, too,'' coach Jalal Talebi graciously
told Sampson. ``But at the end of the day there can be only one
winner.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans never dreamed it would not be them. Even though
they had struggled to qualify for the tournament, they had
developed a reputation for winning the important match _ or at
least not losing it. They had played down a man for much of a
qualifying match against Mexico in Mexico City's foul thin air and
managed a scoreless draw. They had beaten the Canadians by three
goals in Vancouver to get here. They figured they could win last
night, even if the ball wasn't bouncing for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good teams know how to win at this level,'' defender Marcelo
Balboa was saying. ``And we're a good team, but ...''
</P>
<P>
   They are still not good enough to get a result, even after three
consecutive trips to the World Cup. Getting a result is a soccer
term for extracting exactly what you need out of a match. Three
points, one point, or zero points with only one goal allowed. The
countries that win World Cups _ the Brazils, the Germanys, the
Italys, the Argentinas _ know how to get a result.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the kind of game where if Germany was down, 1-0, they
win, 2-1,'' mused playmaker Reyna. Germany was down, 2-0, to
Yugoslavia Sunday afternoon with 16 minutes to play in the broiling
heat with an aging team at Lens. They managed a 2-2 draw. They got
a result.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans, down 1-0, lost 2-1. So they'll fly to Nantes
today and sit around a seaside hotel for three days and wait to
play a match that will mean something in Belgrade but nothing in
Boston. They've canceled next weekend's just-in-case hotel
reservations in Montpellier and Toulouse. Come Friday, they'll put
on their blue blazers and neckties and fly home to a country that
will be watching baseball and Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   ``There'll be 16 countries leaving here next week and we'll be
one of them,'' striker Roy Wegerle was saying, as Iranian drums
banged and cymbals clanged outside the Stade Gerland. ``No
disaster. It's life.

NEITHER SIDE BUDGING IN NBA LABOR NEGOTIATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MIKE WISE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is still time for National Basketball Association players
to form a team and compete for the United States in Athens, Greece,
this summer, just as there is still time for the players and owners
to agree on a deal that would ensure labor peace before the current
collective-bargaining agreement expires on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   But given the stubborn climate of recent negotiations, neither
appears likely. Even with a meeting Monday in New York, both sides
appear headed toward a long, tense summer of bargaining. With major
monetary issues on the table, the league faces the growing
possibility of losing games to labor strife for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, you have to make a deal,'' said Russ Granik, the
league's deputy commissioner, who is heading the negotiations on
behalf of the owners. ``The only question is when and how much
damage you do before you get to that point.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Hunter, the executive director of the players'
association, proposed last Wednesday that both sides agree to a
moratorium rather than the owners' locking out the players. A
lockout would prohibit any NBA business between players and teams,
meaning the free-agent signing period, set to begin July 1, would
be postponed indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   But the owners will not accept any deal that allows more
contracts or trades to be signed and consummated under the current
rules. Barring major concessions, two league officials confirmed
last Friday, a lockout is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Using the world championships in Athens as a platform, the 12
NBA players selected for the team have decided to boycott the games
until a labor agreement is reached. USA Basketball, the
organization that selects teams for international play, stoked the
fires last week, saying it would send another team to Athens.
</P>
<P>
   There is hope for Grant Hill, Gary Payton and friends to play
overseas. FIBA, which oversees international competition, has
privately intimated to USA Basketball that it would accommodate
last-minute replacements in order to field the best team possible.
It is a move that would clear the way for NBA players to decide to
compete shortly before the games begin on July 29.
</P>
<P>
   But while rosters and dates are negotiable, apparently the
players are not budging. ``In all probability, if there is a
lockout, the players will be inclined to vote not to go,'' Hunter
said.
</P>
<P>
   According to a lawyer familiar with the negotiations, the owners
want to install a hard salary cap, essentially a fixed amount each
team can spend in a season, without exceptions. Over the next two
or three seasons, teams would also like to phase out the Larry Bird
exception, in which teams can pay their own free agents whatever
they want, regardless of the salary cap.
</P>
<P>
   For the owners, the ultimate goal is to reduce salaries over a
three-year period so that they do not exceed 48 percent to 50
percent of revenues. They also would like to limit individual
salaries so that one or two players do not gobble up all the money
on a roster.
</P>
<P>
   Whereas the owners see their proposals as finally bringing some
economic balance to a league of $100 million-or-bust contracts, the
players view the approach as taking back what it is already theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not even on the same planet right now,'' said a union
official who requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Draft Variables
</P>
<P>
   This is what preparation for the NBA has come to: A guy who had
not played five-on-five basketball until two years ago may end up
going No. 1 in Wednesday's draft.
</P>
<P>
   Now hedging on whether they will select Arizona point guard Mike
Bibby with the first pick, the Los Angeles Clippers may take the
University of Pacific's 7-foot-1-inch Nigerian, Michael Olowokandi,
this week in Vancouver, British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   The club is said to be divided on which player it will choose,
leaving the door open for the first five or six selections.
Vancouver, which is said to be interested in taking the Kansas
forward Paul Pierce at No. 2, is still entertaining offers from
teams for its pick. The Denver Nuggets, who have the third pick,
are worried the Toronto Raptors will move up from No. 4 to No. 2 in
order to take Olowokandi or Bibby, thus forcing them to take Pierce
instead of the big man they covet.

 &HT;    Another day of blazes in Florida
 &HT;    (EDS: All locations mentioned are in Florida)
 &HT;    By Shannon Colavecchio
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service

<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Firefighters raced to one blaze after
another Sunday as brush fires _ likely started by lightning _
burned near the Palm Beach Gardens Municipal Golf Course and in
woods around Jupiter Middle School.
</P>
<P>
   Two Palm Beach County Fire Rescue units also were sent north to
Jonathan Dickinson State Park in Martin County, where they helped
control a 20-acre fire in the 640-acre Girl Scout camp. A 30-acre
fire also broke out in the Dupree Reserve in Indiantown, Martin
County fire rescue workers said.
</P>
<P>
   No homes were destroyed, no people hurt. But Northern Palm Beach
County and parts of Martin County fell under a heavy haze of brush
fire smoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``These fires have a mind of their own,'' Fire Rescue Lt. Scott
Smith said. ``All we can do is play the waiting game and wait for
it to come to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire near Jupiter Middle School started at about 12:30 p.m.
as two smaller fires about 1,000 feet apart, Smith said. But by 4
p.m., the fires had merged, winds stoked the fire to about 10
acres. At times, the blaze moved dangerously close to portable
classrooms on the south side of the campus.
</P>
<P>
   Although all the fires were contained, future fires could burn
more stubbornly if dry conditions persist in South Florida, Fire
Rescue spokesman Nigel Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a little bit of wind, and you're playing catch up instead
of being ahead of the fires,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, though, that the number of Palm Beach County brush
fires so far this year is below normal because a wet winter delayed
the November start of the brush fire season by two months.
</P>
<P>
   So far this month, less than one-half inch of rain has fallen in
Palm Beach County, according to the National Weather Service. The
norm by this time of month is about 4.9 inches.
</P>
<P>
   There is a 40 percent chance of rain today in Palm Beach County
today , the NWS reported.
</P>
<P>
   Baker said he hopes that forecast comes through. If not, South
Florida risks drying up like North Florida, where weeklong brush
fires have threatened homes and led to evacuations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere Sunday, wildfires closed a stretch of Interstate 95,
kept dozens of evacuated residents near Deland away from their
homes and consumed 10,000 acres of forest owned by paper and timber
companies in north-central Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Firefighters battled blazes in at least 19 counties. Eighty-six
fires had been started in the past 24 hours, mostly by lighting
strikes, and 80 to 90 new fires were expected daily unless Florida
received some rainfall, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Since Memorial Day, fires have burned 72 homes and 41 other
structures in Florida. President Clinton has declared the entire
state a fire disaster area, and a statewide, outdoor, burning ban
remains in effect, indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Forest Service said that 80 percent of the state was at
a drought index level equivalent to a desert. A heat wave continued
to hover over most of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Said Baker: ``We could easily have the same thing happen down
here as well.''

<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ It was remorse, detectives say, that led
wealthy murder suspect Isaac Benarroch to fire a .40 caliber gun
into his own chest a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   But his remorse wasn't over the death of Richardo La Bergere,
the suburban West Palm Beach man police suspect Benarroch ordered
killed. Nor, police say, was it over Zvika Yuz, a Fort Lauderdale,
Fla. man who _ like La Bergere _ was shot to death after receiving
death threats from Benarroch.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, detectives say, Benarroch, 64, a Venezuelan living in
North Miami, Fla., killed himself at an exclusive Georgia resort
because he'd squandered his vast inheritance and would otherwise
have little to leave his children.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than die a working man, Benarroch plotted his own suicide
for at least two years, police said, as part of an elaborate
insurance scheme to leave his children millionaires and still live
out his last years in style.
</P>
<P>
   Police said a shady network of secret investors paid Benarroch's
life insurance premiums while Benarroch lived in a condo equipped
with a waterfall and stream.
</P>
<P>
   His plan was just short of flawless.
</P>
<P>
   State insurance fraud investigators say that even if the
still-secret ``investors'' are identified, it would be hard to
prove in court that they knew Benarroch planned to commit suicide
to pay them back. But investigators may look into whether any
insurance agents may have misled insurance companies about how many
policies had been sold to Benarroch.
</P>
<P>
   Benarroch's $16 million scheme unfolds in files compiled by Palm
Beach County sheriff's deputies investigating the Feb. 12, 1997,
assassination of La Bergere outside the Tennis Club of Palm Beach
in suburban West Palm Beach. A man wearing a motorcycle helmet
wandered the parking lot and tennis courts for two hours before
shooting La Bergere, 64, nine times, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The thick files of the La Bergere homicide case now sit in a box
waiting for a new lead, particularly the shooter's identity, said
sheriff's Detective Michael Wingate, who led the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Leads began drying up after a maid found Benarroch dead in his
$230-a-night room at The Cloister hotel on Sea Island, Ga., a year
ago this past Saturday. After months of investigation, Glenn
County, Ga., police Detective Neal Zealous concluded the death was
a suicide intended to look like an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives in Georgia and Florida learned Benarroch, a fanatical
tennis player, had approached friends in his tennis circles and
even an old University of Miami college roommate about an
opportunity to double their money.
</P>
<P>
   One of those friends was Norman T. Wyllner of Fort Lauderdale.
</P>
<P>
   Wyllner, Benarroch's doubles partner, told detectives he learned
of the plan about two years ago when Benarroch coyly offered an
investment opportunity after a match. Police said Benarroch called
it ``The Great Deal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me in great detail that he was going to commit
suicide,'' according to a transcript of Wyllner's statement to
police. ``His plan was to borrow against his death benefits and
live that last year in grand style...He kept mentioning $16 million
dollars and he showed me a whole bunch of insurance policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Det. Zealous found Benarroch held insurance policies worth
nearly $16 million upon his death with four companies: Two with
Prudential Insurance Company of America in Newark, N.J., for $7
million and $2 million; one with Lincoln Benefit Life Company in
Lincoln, Neb., for $4 million; one with American General Corp. in
Houston, Texas, for $2 million; and one with Traveler's Life &AMP;
Annuities Co. in Hartford, Conn., for $950,000.
</P>
<P>
   Wyllner could not be reached for comment. But according to the
statement he gave to police, Benarroch said he needed investors to
pay the more than $100,000 in insurance premiums per year until the
one- to two-year suicide clauses in the policies expired. Upon
Benarroch's death, the investors would double their money.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned, Wyllner listened on.
</P>
<P>
   `` `In my last year, I want to take these cruises. I want to
rent a beautiful home with a swimming pool. I want to get a
gorgeous young girl, you know, that I can live with,' '' Wyllner
said Benarroch told him. `` `I just want to live it up because I
want to die in about a year.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Then Benarroch explained why. He recalled how his father awoke
at 5 a.m. to sweep the family's little appliance store in Venezuela
when he was a young boy. His parents had worked so hard to give him
a good life; eventually, that little store grew into one of the
biggest stores in Caracas. In time, he inherited a fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gambled away. And spent a lot of it on women. And spent a
lot of it, you know, on tennis,'' Wyllner told investigators.
</P>
<P>
   But as Benarroch reached his 60s, he realized he'd never held a
job and that at his current rate of spending, he would die a
pauper, leaving his two children nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Wyllner told police he suggested Benarroch instead sell the
$400,000 to $500,000 in real estate he still owned and was amazed
at Benarroch's response: ``$400,000? What is that? What am I going
to do? Get a job as a waiter? I can't live off of that interest,
not the way I live.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Benarroch was living in a condominium at the
Cricket Club in North Miami where the maintenance fees alone cost
$1,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   He told Wyllner he planned to kill himself sometime after the
last suicide clause expired _ about December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives said Benarroch saw no point in paying a premium that
would cover a period after his death: June 20, 1997, the day he
killed himself, was two days before the next premium was due.
</P>
<P>
   ``He waited to the last possible minute to kill himself,''
Wingate said.
</P>
<P>
   Although he wouldn't invest in the death plot, Wyllner told
police he agreed to try to recruit a handful of tennis
acquaintances to listen to Benarroch's offer. But it never came
together with the people they knew at their Fort Lauderdale tennis
club, Wyllner told investigators.
</P>
<P>
   People who heard the sketchy sales pitch assumed it was based on
Benarroch having a fatal disease and concluded it was a scam since
Benarroch seemed too strong on the tennis court to be dying,
Wyllner told police.
</P>
<P>
   Although detectives in Georgia, Palm Beach County and Fort
Lauderdale say they're certain Benarroch found the investors he
needed, no one admitted being one. Two of Benarroch's friends said
Benarroch told them that a man in Venezuela had invested $100,000
in the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Det. Zealous said at least three of the insurance companies paid
the beneficiaries in the months following Benarroch's death.
Because the suicide clauses had expired, the companies had to pay
unless they had another reason to withhold payment, detectives
said.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance company associations said a two-year suicide clause is
standard for most life insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
   American General and Prudential confirmed paying a total of $11
million to Benarroch's beneficiaries, but the other companies would
not comment. Zealous said one company contested the validity of the
contract because a premium was either late or unpaid.
</P>
<P>
   Benarroch left $100,000 each to a girlfriend and to a close
female friend he had once dated, and left the rest to his children,
said Fort Lauderdale Det. John King. Benarroch's daughter, Alice
Benarroch, 36, of North Miami, was executor of the will, and her
brother, Alan Benarroch, 34, of Venezuela, was to get money under
the condition that he divorce his wife whom his father disliked,
the detectives said. Neither sibling could be reached for comment
last week.
</P>
<P>
   But before the children could collect, the money went to
Casablanca Investment Corp., a company in Grand Cayman, which their
father organized to handle the estate, King said. Detectives said
they feel certain the children knew nothing of the plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had no idea he was in financial ruin,'' King said. ``It
was his plan and his idea, but he never involved them in his
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Benarroch had other schemes in the works, too, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow or another, before he committed suicide he was going
to kill this other fellow,'' said Wyllner, referring to La Bergere
in his statement to Wingate.
</P>
<P>
   Wyllner told investigators Benarroch feared that if he killed La
Bergere himself, he would be arrested and unable to pay his
premiums. After La Bergere died, Benarroch gloated, but never
directly said he killed him or ordered a hit, Wyllner told Wingate.
</P>
<P>
   Benarroch and La Bergere, a vacuum cleaner salesman, had once
been friends with similar tastes and much in common. They both had
sons named Alan, a love of tennis and a partnership in a Venezuelan
tennis club. La Bergere even married _ and later divorced _ a woman
Benarroch had dated.
</P>
<P>
   La Bergere's family told Wingate the two men became enemies
after La Bergere discovered Benarroch stealing from the partnership
in the early '90s and informed their other partners. There were
word wars in the Venezuelan media and legal battles that further
drained Benarroch's accounts, detectives said. Benarroch was
furious he'd been pushed out and was no longer allowed in his own
club, Wyllner told detectives.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, La Bergere received an unsigned death threat written
from Benarroch's point of view and style; it vowed vengeance within
10 years for having been cheated of $417,000 in the tennis club
venture, detectives said.
</P>
<P>
   About that time, Benarroch was also thought to have been the
author of a death threat sent to Yuz of Fort Lauderdale, police
there said. Yuz had encouraged Benarroch to invest in Premium Sales
Corp., a Miami grocery trading company later accused of fleecing
hundreds of investors out of more than $400 million, investigators
said. Benarroch claimed to have lost $600,000 _ the last money he
had, King said.
</P>
<P>
   Yuz was gunned down in his Mercedes-Benz May 12, 1997,
detectives said, by a man carrying a doll and wearing a fake beard.
The shooting occurred exactly three months after La Bergere was
killed in Palm Beach County.
</P>
<P>
   When Palm Beach County detectives asked Benarroch to come in for
an interview, Benarroch insisted he was innocent and referred them
to his lawyer. The attorney, another of his tennis acquaintances,
turned down the interview request.Editor's question: A 1997 story
said the lawyer did talk to police??
</P>
<P>
   ``Our biggest point of disagreement is whether he did it himself
or hired somebody,'' said King, the Fort Lauderdale detective. ``If
it was a hit man, why would he disguise himself? But if La Bergere
had seen Benarroch, he would have taken some evasive action. The
same thing with Zvi(ka).''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Yuz was killed, Benarroch didn't have the money to
hire hit men, King said. The detective said the property at the
Cricket Club had been foreclosed upon and Benarroch was moving from
one hotel to another; all but one of his credit cards had been
closed for non-payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was his only way to leave behind something for his kids.
He truly cared for them,'' Wingate said. ``He died for them.''

   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   I was hurrying toward Union Square during the rainy spell we had
a few weeks ago. My umbrella had collapsed in the wind and my hands
were full of packages.
</P>
<P>
   I was feeling rather sorry for myself when I saw a homeless man
lying on a sleeping bag on the side of the street and talking to
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, all my self-pity was replaced by guilt. How could I
have felt sorry for myself? I continued to walk along, chastising
myself, and began to search my pockets for change. As I approached
him, I looked more closely and realized that he was not talking to
himself at all _ he was on a cell phone.

   Sister Sheila Campbell is a native New Yorker but she had never
been to the Aquarium at Coney Island until a friend visited.
</P>
<P>
   It was a lovely day and the two were enjoying the indoor and
outdoor display of the sea lions, but Sister Sheila didn't want to
miss the shark feeding, whether it was indoors or out.
</P>
<P>
   She asked the attendant standing next to the indoor shark tank
where the sharks would be fed that afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lady, today we're taking them to Nathan's,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Vargas describes himself as a mature gentleman who has
never taken an interest in the pricey hair salons that cut, blow
and style. He goes to no-frills men's barbershops and opts for the
shortest cut possible. Recently, he came to the conclusion that his
hair style had limited appeal, that perhaps he was the only person
who appreciated it.
</P>
<P>
   This sad fact was made clear to him by an unusual experience
while he was sitting in his barber's chair. A little boy was in the
next chair and he was giving both his mother and the barber a hard
time.
</P>
<P>
   The mother, in desperation (Vargas' words), pointed to Vargas
and said in a threatening tone to her son, ``If you don't behave, I
will tell the barber to cut your hair just like his.''
</P>
<P>
   Things eventually settled down and the mother, realizing that
she might have offended Vargas, attempted an apology. ``I just
wanted to scare him,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Timing is everything! Six visiting sailors, out for a night on
the town, recently got on the subway at West 4th Street. They were
gazing around wide-eyed and clearly excited to be in the big city,
said a fellow passenger, Patricia Hirsch.
</P>
<P>
   A panhandler entered the car and began his speech: ``Ladies and
gentlemen, sorry to disturb you, but has anyone here had to eat
government cheese day after day, every day?''
</P>
<P>
   Six arms in crisp white uniforms shot up, the other occupants of
the car burst into laughter and the panhandler beat a hasty
retreat.

   As Pauline Trigere was walking into the hotel where she usually
has her hair done, a young couple, obviously tourists and
accompanied by their luggage, were awaiting a taxi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kennedy Airport?'' the doorman asked them.
</P>
<P>
   The woman drew herself up indignantly _ no rube she. ``No,'' she
said. ``JFK.''
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DIARY:
</P>
<P>
   A colleague's 2-year-old son was visiting him at the office. The
child sat at a nearby desk playing with a cup of pencils, and a
Mickey Mouse pencil caught his eye. He tried to draw with it but it
made no marks. It was unsharpened. ``What's wrong?'' he asked.
``Nothing comes out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been sharpened yet,'' his father replied.
</P>
<P>
   The boy's face looked blank for a moment but suddenly it lit up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time to get new batteries,'' he said.

   Dorothy Brick Swid was carefully preparing to negotiate the last
step as she went down the escalator at the Port Authority terminal.
A tall young man in blue jeans, directly ahead of her, turned
around and gently helped her off. No words were spoken and he
walked away.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Swid, who says she is a small older lady, was naturally
curious. She caught up with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did you do that?'' she asked. ``I wasn't in need of
assistance. I've traveled all over the world and no one has ever
needed to help me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen my mother in 12 years,'' he said. ``She lives
in the Philippines. I miss her terribly.''
</P>
<P>
   And once again, he walked away.

   DEAR DIARY:
</P>
<P>
   We have taught our 2{-year-old son, Elliot, to be friendly with
the people who live in our apartment building, especially in the
lobby and in the elevators. Those we don't know he refers to as
``neighbors.''
</P>
<P>
   A tall, distinguished-looking, balding man stepped on the
elevator recently and Elliot immediately greeted him with ``Hello
neighbor,'' but then he added, ``What happened to your hair?''
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I almost choked. Not getting an answer, Elliot
turned to me and said clearly, ``Mom, what happened to that guy's
hair?'' There was no escape; our floor was still a way off. I was
just about to stammer something when the neighbor replied: ``I lost
my hair,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Elliot exclaimed: ``You lost your hair? Will you find it?''
</P>
<P>
   My husband and I held in our embarrassment and hysteria with
difficulty until we finally arrived at our floor. Getting off the
elevator, Elliot patted his own hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lost his hair,'' he repeated in amazement and added,
perhaps to reassure us: ``I won't lose mine.''

   Maryanne M. Garbowsky was in the checkout line at a supermarket
the other day, just behind the counter waitress at her local deli.
Ms. Garbowsky greeted her.
</P>
<P>
   The waitress smiled in recognition. ``You're the large tea,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Garbowsky, more than somewhat surprised, congratulated the
woman on her good memory and said she couldn't wait to relate the
encounter to the friend who usually accompanied her to the deli.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, you mean the turkey on rye,'' the waitress replied.
</P>
<P>
   They had finished lunch and Muriel Lilker's friend Ina Shivack,
who had walked to the nearby ladies' room, returned almost
immediately. She had no sooner told Mrs. Lilker that it was
occupied than she spotted another customer heading for the same
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on line,'' Mrs. Shivack called out, running after her. The
other woman kept on walking and Mrs. Shivack repeated that she was
on line.
</P>
<P>
   When they both reached the bathroom door, Mrs. Shivack explained
that she had been waiting to get in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh,'' the other woman replied, ``I thought you were talking
about a computer.''

   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, June 22:
</P>
<P>
   Warm reports about Prince Charles have begun to blossom on both
sides of the Atlantic this summer. Some _ little green fingerlings
of fact, like his contribution of a watercolor he painted of Hong
Kong harbor to an auction this week at the New York Academy of Art
_ gently suggest a creative spirit, a charitable heart. But there
are big flattering images of princely purpose ripening into color,
too.
</P>
<P>
   This newspaper noted the favorable reviews for his creation of
Poundbury, a new town being being built on his land. Praise has
welled up in British publications as different as The Financial
Times and Homes and Antiques magazine. Suddenly the man once
satirized as the dotty ``Prince of Sorrows'' is being celebrated
for integrity, modesty and good taste. Town and Country put Prince
Charles on its cover, smiling gently in his garden.
</P>
<P>
   Such a shift in image can sometimes be the result of artful
public relations work, a careful mulching and watering of the
media. The British press, chastened by the criticism of its pursuit
of Diana, the princess of Wales, in the wake of her death, has been
in a mood to be receptive. The image of England's remote,
expensive, undisciplined royal clan was in dire need of freshening.
</P>
<P>
   There were also issues of personal character. When Diana's
traumatic death brought the monarchy's cold ineptitude into such
sharp relief, the perception of the prince had been crumbling,
piece by piece, through almost two decades of marital scandal and
disintegration. She had become an icon of glamour, motherhood and
good deeds. His public persona had been reduced to that of an
eccentric blunderer: unrequited in love and work, ineffectual in
fatherhood, moodily puttering in his garden.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as her presence fades and a collection of her ball gowns
goes on paid exhibition at the new Ronald Reagan Building in
Washington, Prince Charles is beginning to enjoy a different kind
of reputation. With his enduring lover, Camilla Parker Bowles,
somewhere out of sight, and the prince more often in view in the
company of his sons, there seems to be a welling public regard for
him.
</P>
<P>
   He is seen as a protective father, an innovative manager of his
estates, a thoughtful man, a modest, candid future king. In the
warmth of this summer, as his 50th birthday nears this fall, it
seems the prince and his country are starting to graft. After such
a long period of growing apart, it is a startling sight.

 &HT;    As Janzen rises, Lehman fades (again)
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Payne Stewart thought the man in his own twosome
would be the one to worry about Sunday at The Olympic Club. So did
the gallery. So did most of the media. So did Melissa Lehman, who
often could not see over the fans to note the pain and frustration
on his husband's face.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the gods made their decision and Tom Lehman faded on a
U.S. Open Sunday, the victim of a cruel putter and possibly of
history, too.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Janzen had foiled Stewart before, by two shots in the 1993
U.S Open with a record-tying score of 272 at Baltusrol. On Sunday
he did it again, coming from as many as seven shots off the lead to
win the 98th U.S Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I bring out the best in Lee Janzen,'' Stewart said,
still shell-shocked from a final round 74 that provided Janzen his
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I think I might bring out the best in him, too,''
said Janzen, who earned $535,000. ``It might not be true at all,
but I know it's a friendly competition.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the complaining Stewart had done about landing in a
divot filled with sand on the 12th hole or the USGA warning he
received for slow play, all that really mattered in the end was the
20-foot putt he stood over on the 18th hole. For a second or two it
looked headed for the cup, but just broke off, securing the win and
ending Stewart's chance to force a playoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could hardly stand to watch,'' Janzen said. ``If he makes
it, we're playing off. If he misses, I've won the tournament. It
just broke off there at the last bit. I guess it never really
dawned on me that I could actually win the tournament today until
that moment.''
</P>
<P>
   While history might think otherwise, suggesting that the man
with the four-shot lead with a round to play indeed blew the U.S.
Open, Stewart lobbied hard to note the quality of Janzen's
2-under-68. When the champion finishes at even par, all seemed to
agree, the venue emerged as the real winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll sleep just fine tonight,'' said Stewart, ``because I know
I did as well as I could.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman, who has come up short for four straight U.S Opens,
seemed the real victim. When be bogeyed the 14th hole to drop to
4-over, he knew his day was over. The double-bogey at 17th was just
added pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. Open is a tournament of momentum,'' Lehman said. ``If
you don't get it, you beat your head against the wall all the way.
When you're fighting to make par, you feel like you're treading
water waiting for the inevitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Janzen, who had not won a PGA Tour event in three years and blew
his opportunity to win a second Players Championship in March with
a Sunday 79, was filled with emotion after the win. That it came on
Father's Day, with his dad Larry in the crowd and son Connor
present, made for, well, an Olympic moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel extremely lucky just to have the opportunity to play
golf for a living,'' Janzen said, ``but to win the U.S. Open twice,
you just can't do any better than that.''

SPORTS COLUMN: TURNING OPPORTUNITY INTO DUST 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLAIRE SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reggie Jackson was a player who knew how to stir up a laugh with
his one-liners as well as he could shake up a game with his bat. He
once demonstrated that agility with one quip after a game in which
he struck out four consecutive times, but won it with a grand slam
in his final at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' Jackson deadpanned, ``if I had a good day or a
bad day.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday the Mets had to feel much the way Jackson did on that
star-crossed day. Yes, they enjoyed a 3-2 victory over the Florida
Marlins, wonderfully punctuated by a game-saving performance by
John Franco, who pitched the Mets out of a bases-loaded, no-outs
jam in the top of the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Franco celebrated by pumping his fist, thereby pumping up his
team. After the victory, however, the reliever did not hesitate to
take the team to task. He questioned the Mets for their inability
to salvage more from a stretch of games in which schedule makers
all but gift-wrapped game-winning opportunities against Florida and
Montreal, two of the weakest teams in the major leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's victory was the Mets' lone moment of triumph in an
otherwise lost and debilitating three-game series against the
Marlins. That brought the Mets' now-completed 10-game run against
the Marlins and Expos to 4-6. That, the Mets know, is unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Franco acknowledged the conflicted feelings that resulted from
the missed chances. Moments after his heroic two-inning performance
assured the Mets' first victory in five games, the always frank
reliever said: ``I think the last seven to 10 games, we've been
brutal. Hopefully this was our hump game. We're going to be playing
against better teams now.'' If the Mets don't wake up, Franco said,
they will be in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   And the big boys are coming, in the form of the underachieving
yet still potent Baltimore Orioles, who are host to the Mets Monday
night, and _ the last team the Mets could possibly want to see
during a time of struggle _ the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   Before looking ahead, though, the Mets might take time to
fitfully look back. If there had ever been a chance to convince
everyone, including themselves, that they are contenders as opposed
to pretenders, the Expos and Marlins presented it, tied up with
bright ribbons and bows.
</P>
<P>
   Such soft spots in the schedule have to be taken advantage of,
if not feasted on. Other teams, when given the chance this season,
certainly have. Five teams have been presented with the enticing
opportunity to play the Expos and Marlins in consecutive series,
and the Mets have failed to exploit the situation as well as the
others.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Cubs and the Brewers won six of seven _ and that was
before the Marlins further downsized to a minor-league caliber
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, who have to revel in any favorable comparison to
the Mets, faced consecutive interleague series against the Expos
and Marlins and turned them into walkovers, winning five of six
games.
</P>
<P>
   The one comparison that must really smart involves the Braves,
the team the Mets are chasing in the National League East. Atlanta,
playing the same ``gimme'' schedule as the Mets, proved to be only
slightly more opportunistic, winning only five of nine against
Montreal and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to run the numbers to see the precious chances
blown by the Mets, who lost two games in the standing during a rare
period in which the Braves were merely mortal. ``We haven't played
up to our expectations,'' lamented catcher Mike Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   And no Met pretended that the famine turned into a feast, even
in victory Sunday, considering that one of the Mets' runs scored on
a walk, a hit and a groundout and another on an error, a walk and a
wild pitch. The offense remains missing in action.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just seems like it's going to be a part of our story this
year,'' said manager Bobby Valentine, who has used more than 60
lineups in 70 games while searching for some answers.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's formula worked. Yet even though the Mets defeated the
rookie Joe Fonentot, who is without a victory in the major leagues,
they had to know it was not in a way that was close to being
palatable. Not when a pitcher who entered the game with an 8.14
earned run average pitched convincingly for seven innings,
something he had done only twice before this season and never above
Class AA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always seems like we play down to the lower competition,
teams we're supposed to beat,'' Franco said.
</P>
<P>
   Left fielder Bernard Gilkey said: ``We don't feel we've played
our best baseball, and that's kind of hard to accept. Nothing
against these teams, but I know we have the personnel to win more
games against the Montreals and Floridas. It just seems like we
were fighting against ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday night the battle resumes against teams capable of
offering even greater resistance, and more than just saving face
will be at stake. All because of the golden opportunities the Mets
turned into dust.

EDITORIAL: DISTRUST AND FEAR IN FLINT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mich.)  (mk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, June 22:
</P>
<P>
   The United Automobile Workers' strike against General Motors in
Flint, Mich., is an indication of just how deep distrust can still
run in an industry where workers and management all too often have
seen each other as enemies whose every action is viewed with
hostility.
</P>
<P>
   This strike began in that atmosphere. Each side believes the
other failed to live up to promises made more than a year ago. The
company says workers are refusing to implement agreements to
improve productivity, while the workers accuse management of not
making promised investments to improve the plant and fear
management secretly wants to move their jobs to Mexico or to
nonunion suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Neither side thinks it can rely on the word of the other, and
there is no sign that the strike, which began June 5, will end
soon. Workers and the company are suffering as the strike forces GM
to close most of its North American assembly lines.
</P>
<P>
   For the workers themselves, there is no reason to fear losing
their jobs. The UAW's contract with GM guarantees that current
union workers can keep working until they retire. But GM's hourly
work force in America has been declining steadily with attrition,
and is now less than half the level of two decades ago. The workers
fear their children will not have the opportunities they had to get
well-paid auto-industry jobs.
</P>
<P>
   With the American economy booming, GM is making money, a fact
that makes it harder for the company to plead necessity as it
pushes for higher productivity. But the world auto industry has
substantial overcapacity, and some kind of shakeout is probably
inevitable. For American plants to continue to compete in making
affordable cars, companies and workers must find a way to
cooperate. Ford and Chrysler have done a far better job of this
than has General Motors, which is enduring its 16th strike in five
years.
</P>
<P>
   This strike will be settled at some point, and General Motors
cars will again roll off the assembly lines. But if the two sides
do not find a way to change the atmosphere of distrust and
hostility, the chances of GM's regaining its competitive edge _ and
of being in a position to hire the children of current workers _
will not be good.

NEW YORK LIBERTY BEAT UTAH STARZZ 68-64
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By STEVE POPPER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The first time that Kym Hampton took the ball to the
basket, determined to challenge the Utah Starzz's 7-foot-2-inch
center, Margo Dydek, Hampton admitted, she was as frightened and
curious to see the result as the 15,754 fans at Madison Square
Garden. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Giving away a foot to Dydek _ and even Hampton's teammates are
skeptical of the 6-2 listed in her bio _ Hampton took the ball to
the basket and came away unscathed. Once that worked, she did it
again and again, scoring a career-high 22 points to help the
Liberty to a 68-64 victory. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It worked three times for Hampton before Dydek blocked one of
her shots, which was enough to lift the confidence of the center
and allow her to believe Coach Nancy Darsch's insistence that she
play more aggressively. Hampton greeted the coach's advice with a
willing spirit but a dubious mind, facing the Women's National
Basketball Association's version of Wilt Chamberlain, although
Dydek's game may be more similar to Shawn Bradley's.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first couple shots, I just tried to take it to her and see
what happens,'' said Hampton, who shot 8-of-18 from the floor and
pulled down a season-high 10 rebounds. ``It was a good response.
They started falling, and they didn't pick me up great, so I was
just like, `Yeah.' Nancy said for me to take it to her and see if
we can get her in foul trouble. That's all I did. She's really
tall, but she's thin and not that strong. I tried to move her.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Darsch said: ``We did go right at Margo. We have to play
aggressive. It doesn't matter if she's 6-foot or 7-foot. We need to
go to the block and have post players get position down there and
draw contact or get 3-point plays. We did that today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty, playing its first home game of the season after a
dismal 1-4 road trip, desperately needed something. New York lost
to Utah on Monday by 71-60. The home-court advantage hardly seemed
to provide an inspiration at the start as the Liberty fell behind
by 10-2 and then by 15-4. Dydek showed a deft shooting touch,
hitting all five of her field goal attempts in the first half and
adding a pair of free throws for 12 points. But Hampton had 10
points in the first half and the Liberty was able to close the gap
to just three at the half, 32-29. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the second half, Rebecca Lobo, who had just two points in the
first half, got the Liberty started by scoring the team's first
eight points of the half for its first lead since 2-0. Hampton
continued to work inside in the second half, while Dydek was unable
to get her shot off. Sidelined by foul trouble for much of the
second half, Dydek attempted just one field goal and made it to
finish a perfect 6-of-6 from the floor. But Hampton outscored her
by 12-2 after halftime. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the first meeting between these teams, Hampton had settled
for outside shots and was just 2-of-8 from the floor for five
points. Lobo was 2-of-11 in that game, timid to bring the ball
inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the second time around, our players were less in awe
of her size and her shot-blocking ability,'' Darsch said of Dydek.
``We were just getting used to it a little bit. Kym played the same
way in the second half against L.A. Hopefully, what we had here
today is what we'll see from here on out. What we need is a low
block presence. Kym can get to work down there with her and her
quickness after getting the ball.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Vickie Johnson, who had 17 points, gave the Liberty the lead for
good, 60-59, with a pair of free throws with 2 minutes 55 seconds
to play. Hampton scored inside around Dydek on the next possession,
and Johnson followed that with a 3-point field goal from the corner
with one second left on the 30-second clock to give New York a
65-59 advantage. Teresa Weatherspoon, who had eight assists and six
steals, added a free throw and then Johnson swiped the Starzz's
inbounds pass and went the distance to complete an 11-0 run.

Astros complete sweep of Reds
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Under most circumstances, a 3-1 victory over the lowly Cincinnati
Reds would be no big deal.
</P>
<P>
   But conditions Sunday were hardly ideal for the Astros, who
faced an unfavorable pitching matchup _ at least on paper _ and
went to battle without Billy Wagner and Doug Henry, their two top
relief pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Not a problem. The Astros scuffled their way to a win loaded
with redeeming value for pitchers Pete Schourek and Mike Magnante,
who joined Trever Miller to stifle the Reds and help the Astros
complete their first series sweep of Cincinnati since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek, who was coming off his worst outing of the season,
pitched six solid innings to claim his fourth victory, and Magnante
retired the final two batters for save No. 1 _ a day after blowing
a 5-2 lead and displaying faulty command.
</P>
<P>
   ``A sweep is always great,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said.
``But this was especially satisfying because we didn't have Billy
and Doug to close.''
</P>
<P>
   Wagner has a tired arm and was given the day off. Henry has been
sidelined for the first five games of a seven-game homestand with
soreness in his right elbow. Both should be available tonight when
the Astros open a two-game interleague series against Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek left with a two-run lead after six innings, and Miller
and Magnante made it stand up as the Astros won for the 11th time
in their last 15 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was obviously a great win from my standpoint,'' Magnante
said. ``I didn't get the job done (Saturday), and it was good to
get right back out there and have a chance to help the team win.''
</P>
<P>
   And this was no easy save. With one out and two men on in the
ninth, Dierker traded lefties, lifting Miller for Magnante with
All-Star shortstop Barry Larkin coming up.
</P>
<P>
   Righthander Bob Scanlan was ready to enter the game, but Dierker
opted for Magnante, who got a weak ground ball from Larkin and
struck out switch-hitting Dmitri Young to end the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to keep (lefthanded pinch-hit possibilities) Willie
Greene and Eddie Taubensee out of the game, because those guys can
hit the ball out of the park,'' Dierker said. ``The only way to
keep them out of the game was to keep running lefties out there.''
</P>
<P>
   With Wagner around, save opportunities are rare for other
members of the Astros' bullpen. Wagner has 18 of the team's 23
saves, and Magnante isn't ready to replace his good buddy as the
closer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billy can have that stuff,'' Magnante said. ``That's too much
pressure for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Albeit mild, Schourek was under pressure to perform in light of
Scott Elarton's solid debut. If Elarton continues to pitch well,
the Astros might want to find a spot in the rotation for him, and
Schourek has been the most inconsistent starter on the staff. In
his previous outing, a 9-4 loss to St. Louis, Schourek lasted just
three innings (six runs, five hits and a career-high seven walks).
</P>
<P>
   ``I was eager to get back up after being knocked down my last
time out,'' said Schourek, who lowered his ERA to 4.26. ``I tried
to kick myself in the butt to get it going again. I felt like
things went pretty well. I was able to mix my pitches and throw
strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Schourek pitched for the Reds the past four seasons, he
said he took no special pleasure in beating his former teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to win every single game,'' he said. ``It's a little
more fun when you're out there going against a lot of guys that you
know, but as far as extra motivation, there was nothing there.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's game was a battle of Pistol Petes _ Houston's Schourek
and Cincinnati's Harnisch, who also was working against his former
team.
</P>
<P>
   Harnisch shot himself in the foot in the third inning when he
hit Craig Biggio and put himself in position to face the heart of
the Astros' order with one out. Biggio moved to second on a single
by Bill Spiers and scored on Jeff Bagwell's base hit to left.
</P>
<P>
   Schourek, who threw a season-high 116 pitches, retired 12 of the
first 20 batters he faced before the Reds got something going in
the sixth inning. Young doubled and scored on a sacrifice fly by
Sean Casey.
</P>
<P>
   That proved to be the only run for the Reds, who left 12 men on
base and never collected more than one hit in any inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the same old Pete (Schourek),'' Reds manager Jack
McKeon said. ``I wish some of our guys could have been a little
more patient, but you have to give Pete credit. He pitched a good
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Things began to fall apart in the sixth for Harnisch, who
allowed the first three batters to reach base. Bagwell and Moises
Alou singled, and Carl Everett drew a walk to load the bases for
Tony Eusebio.
</P>
<P>
   Harnisch got Eusebio to hit into a double play, but Bagwell was
able to score for a 2-1 lead. Ricky Gutierrez singled home Alou.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the bullpen and stellar defensive plays by Biggio,
Spiers and Derek Bell were all the Astros needed to move to 18
games over .500 (46-28).
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys played some great defense,'' Miller said. ``I know
they probably kept me out there a little longer than I might have
lasted. I wanted to try to finish, but I got a little tired and
started overthrowing at the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect the guys who close because those are some tough
situations. The crowds are a little louder, and everything seems
magnified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, Mags was able to come in and close it out,''
Miller said. ``I have a lot of confidence in our bullpen. We're
going to pick this team up a lot more than we're going to let it
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday was the perfect time for a pick-me-up.

EMOTIONS BEGIN TO SURFACE ABOUT SERIES WITH BRAVES AND METS
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Two weeks ago, even two days ago, many of the
Yankees played down the games they would play in the next seven
days: four against the Atlanta Braves, who have the best record in
the National League, and three against the Mets. But on the eve of
the coming series, emotions have begun to surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be pretty special,'' said Joe Torre, the
Yankees' manager. ``Especially the weekend with the Mets. That's
going to be electric. It's going to be loud; it's going to be
boisterous. I anticipate security will be increased.''
</P>
<P>
   Several players feel that the Yankees, a team having a great
season, will have an opportunity to play other good teams in a
playoff-type atmosphere. October-style baseball at the summer
solstice.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees will play host to the Braves on Monday (Atlanta's
Greg Maddux will start against Andy Pettitte) and Tuesday, and then
fly to Atlanta on Wednesday for two games at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got the best record from the American League, the best
record from the National League,'' said the reliever Jeff Nelson,
``and the possibility, if everything goes well, that we could meet
in the World Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre does not like interleague play. He feels that if the
Yankees and Braves meet in the post-season, the midseason games
will have robbed the World Series of the mystery that used to be
inherent in October. ``You had teams that really didn't know much
about each other, feeling each other out,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   But now there is some information to be gleaned from the
interleague games. Nelson, for instance, will probably be matched
against the Braves' right-handed-hitting Andres Galarraga in
late-inning situations. ``Maybe I'll learn something about him,''
Nelson said. David Cone, too, has not faced Galarraga since the
slugger went to Colorado, and he is curious about what has changed
in Galarraga's swing since the days when Cone pitched for the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius played for Oakland this season, and even in spring
training he had never had the chance to face Maddux, Tom Glavine,
et al. ``This will be a good chance for me to get a feel for
them,'' Brosius said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Torre: ``It's important that you play every team tough. You
don't want anyone to manhandle you _ that could be a psychological
factor in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The series with the Mets, Nelson said, ``is just as big as any
other, and probably as big as the World Series, as far as George
Steinbrenner and New Yorkers are concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Torre: ``I've been on both sides of the fence, and it means
a lot to ownership on both sides to beat the other team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look forward to the Mets to get it over with. That's going
to be a spectacle. I will be happy when that's over with.''
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, the earned run average leaders in the respective
leagues will pitch against each other on Friday _ the Yankees'
Hideki Irabu against the Mets' Al Leiter. Bobby Jones and Masato
Yoshii of the Mets are scheduled to pitch against Pettitte and
Orlando Hernandez, respectively, in the final two games of the
series.
</P>
<P>
   The Umpire's Earring
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre related a story about John Shulock, the umpire who was
behind home plate in spring training when Cleveland's Jaret Wright
hit Luis Sojo and broke his hand. Shulock was wearing an earring
that day, which drew the attention of Torre and Indian Manager Mike
Hargrove before the game. ``What's that all about?'' Torre asked,
for Shulock may have become the first umpire with an earring.
</P>
<P>
   Shulock explained that he had made a deal with his daughter. If
she earned excellent grades, he would wear an earring for a month.
She got the grades.
</P>
<P>
   After Sojo was hit, Shulock went to Hargrove, concerned about
the bad blood brewing. Then, with emphasis, Shulock said, ``I'm
going to stop this right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Hargrove mused dryly, ``I don't think you're going to stop it
wearing that earring.''
</P>
<P>
   Roster Developments
</P>
<P>
   Some updates on matters that could impact the Yankees' roster:
</P>
<P>
   _ Bernie Williams, on the 15-day disabled list with a sprained
right knee, began working out on an exercise cycle this weekend. If
all goes well, Joe Torre said, he will begin jogging and running on
Monday. Williams is eligible to come off the disabled list on
Friday, when the series with the Mets is to begin, and some of his
teammates believe he will return to the lineup sometime during the
weekend. Torre, who has said he does not expect Williams to be back
until after the All-Star Game break, is more skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   _ Mike Stanton still does not know anything more about the
appeal of his suspension. As it stands, he is scheduled to start
serving his suspension on Wednesday, when the Yankees will be
playing the third of their four games with the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jeff Nelson had an ice pack strapped to his lower back in the
clubhouse Sunday, treating stiffness that apparently has been
bothering him for the last week or so. Nelson's problem is not
considered serious, and Torre said he should continue to be
available to pitch.

<P>
   They are both students from Congo who fled to the United States,
certain they would have been killed in the political turmoil at
home. Bakam Mimpongo, 21, was caught at New York's Kennedy
International Airport, trying to enter with fake papers. Bisinwa
Borumbi, 22, stowed away in a cargo ship and was seized in
Jacksonville, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Each gave similar accounts of persecution, of paramilitary
groups and rebels ravaging villages and taking prisoners, of their
desperate need for asylum.
</P>
<P>
   But in the United States, their paths have sharply diverged. Ms.
Mimpongo spent five months and 10 days in a federal detention
center in New York City last year before being granted asylum.
Borumbi, detained in Miami in February of this year, was freed on
parole after three weeks, but his case has not yet been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration lawyers and advocates for refugees point to the
different treatment of cases like these as a sign that federal
immigration laws are applied unevenly throughout the nation.
Important decisions _ from how long it takes to review an asylum
seeker's case to whether he or she is quickly paroled or detained
for months _ seem to hinge more on the number of beds available at
a detention center than on a cohesive national policy.
</P>
<P>
   Since April 1, 1997, when a new law took effect, the Immigration
and Naturalization Service has detained all asylum seekers upon
arrival and required them to go through a procedure called
``expedited removal.'' The process was intended by Congress to
reduce the number of false claims for asylum. The law denies asylum
seekers full hearings with legal representation and the right to
federal appeals unless they can quickly convince immigration
officials that they have a ``credible fear'' of persecution in
their homeland. Those found to have no ``significant possibility''
of winning asylum are swiftly deported.
</P>
<P>
   Those whose claims are found plausible can be freed on parole.
The law specifies, however, that parole is to be granted only on a
case-by-case basis and only for ``urgent humanitarian reasons or
significant public benefit.''
</P>
<P>
   But since Congress never defined ``urgent humanitarian
reasons,'' the INS has allowed its 33 district directors to
exercise their discretion in deciding whether to keep detainees
behind bars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congress has raised the bar as to who can be paroled, making
it more difficult to justify releasing someone from detention,'' an
INS spokesman in Washington, Russell Bergeron, said. ``And what's
urgent and humanitarian for one district director may not be so for
another.''
</P>
<P>
   The inconsistencies in granting parole are dizzying, said
Charles Wheeler, who monitors the cases of asylum seekers
nationwide as the supervisor of the detention project at the
Catholic Legal Immigration Network, a private advocacy group in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   In El Paso, Texas, he said, many asylum seekers have to post
bond before being paroled. In Los Angeles and New Jersey, asylum
seekers are usually released, but only if family members will
sponsor them. In Miami, virtually everyone is released. In New
York, virtually no one is.
</P>
<P>
   ``If, in fact, this law was conceived to send a strong message
abroad that the United States was getting tough on immigration,''
Wheeler said, ``then the message ought to be a consistent one.
Right now the message is: If you come through Miami, you are OK,
but don't come to New York. You'll be stuck in detention.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A recently released study and interviews with more than a dozen
lawyers and their clients confirm Wheeler's findings. While some
asylum seekers are allowed to argue their cases shortly after
arrival, others languish in detention for months, sometimes
surrounded by convicted criminals in county jails. Some are
released after posting bond as low as $5,000, or simply by
providing the address where they plan to reside.
</P>
<P>
   While some women with children are released immediately, others
are held for months, separated from their children. Lawyers said
that clients with identical cases might be treated differently from
one month to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration lawyers and advocates for refugees say that these
irregularities are an especially urgent issue now because the
swiftness of deportations under the new law makes the need for a
good, timely defense more critical than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Under the old law, people who requested asylum were allowed to
stay in the country while their cases were heard by immigration
judges. If the judges ruled against them, they could appeal to the
Board of Immigration Appeals and then the federal courts, a process
that could take a year or more.
</P>
<P>
   Now, detainees are under pressure to prepare a compelling case
quickly _ and lawyers say this is a difficult task for people
behind bars. Instead of freely searching for lawyers and preparing
their cases, detainees who do not speak English or know the laws of
the United States must often wait for lawyers to spot them and
visit them at detention centers, usually out-of-the-way places that
resemble jails and afford little privacy.
</P>
<P>
   There is no way of knowing precisely how many people have been
affected adversely by the law, because the federal government does
not keep statistics of how many people who go through the new
procedures are denied asylum. But asylum seekers are always a tiny
percentage of the hundreds of thousands people who seek entry into
the United States every year.
</P>
<P>
   From August of last year through the end of January, for
example, 1,300 new arrivals expressed a fear to return home. Of
those, 1,066 were sent to detention centers; the rest were
deported.
</P>
<P>
   ``How we treat asylum seekers is a reflection of who we are as a
nation,'' said Leonard Glickman, executive vice president at the
Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society in New York City, the group that
helped Ms. Mimpongo win her case. ``The law was not just for the
benefit of the country. It was also supposed to help those who
needed help. That's where we have fallen short.''

</P>
<P>
   The irregularities in the process _ and the fact that much of it
remains closed to public scrutiny _ have led members of Congress to
call for a study of the ways the INS deals with asylum seekers. The
bill directs the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees to study
whether immigration officers in the United States are ``detaining
such aliens improperly or in inappropriate conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have heard many complaints, and we are concerned,'' said
Elizabeth Kessler, general counsel of the Senate's immigration
subcommittee, whose chairman is Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich. ``We
do have a federal law, and it should be interpreted the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials in Washington said they would welcome such
a study.
</P>
<P>
   A report released in May _ the first independent study of the
new procedure _ indicates that the number of days asylum seekers
remain in detention is higher in New York than anywhere else in the
nation. The study, prepared by the International Human Rights and
Migration Project of the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at
Santa Clara University in California, revealed that by the time the
study ended, the average number of days in detention for detainees
in New York was 92, while for detainees in San Francisco the
average was 44 and for those in Miami it was 62. The INS has
dismissed the study as ``flawed.''
</P>
<P>
   Karen Musalo, a co-director of the study, said that asylum
seekers _ sometimes mothers and their children _ are routinely kept
in detention in New York for months until a judge hears their case.
</P>
<P>
   That is what happened to Sivajini Kadambarathnam, 35, and her
13-year-old son, Rajakumar. The two were stopped on March 12, upon
arrival at Kennedy Airport without documents from Sri Lanka, and
ordered detained, her immigration records show. But because no
children are allowed in the Wackenhut detention center in Jamaica,
Queens, Rajakumar was sent to a center for juveniles in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cried and cried and cried,'' said Mrs. Kadambarathnam, who
fled her country after her husband was taken away by the military
last year. ``But then they put handcuffs on me and that shut me up.
No one had ever done that to me before.''
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officials said they were willing to release the boy,
but not the mother, to sponsors. But the sponsor would not take the
boy by himself, so the two remained in detention but separated, one
of her lawyers, Eileen Collins Bretz, said. The INS said the two
were separated because minors were not allowed in the New York
detention center. Mrs. Kadambarathnam was granted political asylum
and released June 2, after nearly three months in detention. Her
son had been released a day earlier.
</P>
<P>
   In Miami, where the influx of Haitian and Central American
immigrants seldom lets up, the Krome detention center routinely
releases asylum seekers who can show they have a place to stay,
said Stacey Taeuber, a pro-bono lawyer who works with detainees.
The policy was different last year: to be released on parole,
asylum seekers needed to post a $5,000 bond.
</P>
<P>
   One of Ms. Taeuber's clients was Gabriel Jaime Castano, 28, a
Colombian immigrant who said he had no intention of seeking
political asylum when he arrived at Miami International Airport in
January with a visitor's visa. A farmer from near Medellin, Castano
said he had gone to Miami to escape his country's violence for a
few weeks. He was tired of paying off both the army and the
guerrillas _ with 20 live chickens a month _ to stay alive, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Immigration officers detained him because they did not believe
he intended only to visit, Castano said. After consulting with
lawyers there, he said he realized that asking for political asylum
would get him out of detention faster than sticking to his original
claim.
</P>
<P>
   That tactic would probably not have worked in New York. When the
Wackenhut detention center fills up, asylum seekers are sent to a
detention center in Elizabeth, N.J., or to the York County Prison,
in York, Pa., said Mark Thorn, a spokesman from the INS office in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Judy Epstein, a spokeswoman from the Hebrew Immigrant Aid
Society, said that one of the agency's clients _ a 20-year-old
woman from Ghana who has been detained for seven months _ was
recently transferred to Pennsylvania. The woman, Swaibatu Mohammed,
told the agency that five other women were moved with her.
</P>
<P>
   In years to come, the INS intends to detain even more people as
it builds more detention facilities, said Bergeron. In doing so, he
said, the agency would be following the mandate of Congress, which
since 1996 has allocated $205.3 million to add 7,364 spaces to the
agency's current detention capacity and 882 positions to its
payroll.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the INS has 15,000 beds in nine detention facilities,
prisons and an array of local jails around the country, an 80
percent increase from the number of beds available just three years
ago. Yet, Bergeron said, to accommodate all the people the law
mandates be detained _ those who seek entry into the United States
with no papers or with fraudulent documents _ the agency will have
to double its current detention capacity.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time now,'' Bergeron said, ``we have both the
statutory mandate to detain them and the space to hold them.''

ALFRED PALCA, 78, BLACKLISTED WRITER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DINITIA SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Alfred Palca, a blacklisted writer whose film ``Go
Man Go,'' about the Harlem Globetrotters, became a classic among
basketball fans, died June 18 at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan.
He was 78 and lived in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said his sister, Roz Leader.
</P>
<P>
   In 1953 Palca, who was just completing ``Go Man Go,'' was
accused by FBI agents of being a communist. It was only after he
removed his name from the credits that he was able to find a
distributor for the film. Palca's career never recovered from the
accusation and he never wrote or produced another movie.
</P>
<P>
   Though Palca said he was ``attracted by the Soviet Union's
socialist ideals,'' he once told an interviewer that he ``was never
a communist.''
</P>
<P>
   After the accusations, Palca said, ``My career was phhhttt.'' He
supported his family by writing magazine articles, plays,
television shows and, with Monte Ghertler, a nonfiction book about
sex called ``The Couple,'' all the while remaining optimistic. Last
year he was writing a script that he said ``will start my career
all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Palca was born in Manhattan and educated at Boys High School in
Brooklyn and at New York University, from which he graduated in
1940. He began writing for NBC radio while he was in college. He
served as a private in World War II and did public relations for
the show ``This Is the Army.''
</P>
<P>
   When the war ended, Palca worked as a publicity agent for 20th
Century Fox. In 1950 Columbia Pictures agreed to finance his film
about the Globetrotters. Palca hired Sidney Poitier, who then owned
a rib shop in Harlem, to star in the movie. In fact, Palca said,
part of the proof that he was a communist, the FBI told him, was
that he had hired Poitier, a black man.
</P>
<P>
   The film, with Palca's name removed, was distributed by Fox.
Palca gave the producing credit to his brother-in-law, Anton
Leader, and the screen-writing credit to his cousin, Arnold Becker,
a pediatrician.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the film's success, Palca said he never liked it. As the
years passed, looking at it made him ``wince,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, at a 50th-anniversary ceremony honoring blacklisted
Hollywood writers and directors at the Academy Theater in Los
Angeles, Palca's writing credit was restored.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a wonderful ceremony,'' said Ms. Leader, who was there
with him. ``There were 20 to 25 of them, those who have survived,
around. The whole audience just applauded.''
</P>
<P>
   And Palca's reaction to the event? ``I can't tell you,'' Ms.
Leader said. ``It's a four-letter word. He felt it was long
overdue.''
</P>
<P>
   Palca is survived by Ms. Leader of Los Angeles; his wife, Doris,
of Manhattan; a daughter, Margaret Palca, of Brooklyn; a son, Joe
Palca, of Washington, and four grandchildren.

IRANIANS FILL THE STREETS IN CELEBRATION 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ The young woman flung off her head scarf and hung
out the window of the blue Volkswagen, her long red hair flying
wild in the wind.
</P>
<P>
   Just behind was a police car with four officers, cheering and
waving at the crowd. Iran had beaten the United States in the World
Cup in France, and in Tehran it was a moment for mad celebration,
not Islamic punishment.
</P>
<P>
   In a massive communal celebration that froze traffic, freed
spirits and cut across lines of class and gender, Iranians poured
into the streets the moment the game ended at 1:30 Monday morning.
Amid thousands of fans gathered in Vanak Square in central Tehran,
a dozen men danced together, stringing the names of Iran's soccer
stars into a rhyming chant.
</P>
<P>
   A man and a woman sat halfway out of their car windows and
swayed to the American rock music that blared from their car.
Another man climbed up a 20-foot lamppost as the crowd cheered and
uniformed and plainclothes police officers and army troops looked
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good picture,'' one bewildered officer carrying a
walkie-talkie said.
</P>
<P>
   Old men strolled the streets in nightshirts. Some women waved
flares and pounded on cars, ordering drivers to honk their horns
and cheer. Other women went out on their balconies wearing only
nightgowns and slippers.
</P>
<P>
   Young people whistled and whooped, honked and hollered to
proclaim the victory over their political nemesis. Flags were
waved, whistles blown, candies distributed, fireworks lighted, car
alarms activated, soap suds sprayed.
</P>
<P>
   The only chant that could be heard about the United States was
not ``Marg bar Amrika'' _ ``Death to America'' _ but ``Iran hoorah,
Amrika sourakh'' _ ``Iran hurray, America a hole,'' referring to
the American team's weak defense that led to Iran's 2-1 victory.
</P>
<P>
   In south central Tehran, a woman handed out sweets to strangers
for what she called a dual celebration.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son Ahmed promised me if Iran wins, he's going to marry the
girl I want,'' said the woman, who was riding on the back of her
son's motorbike, her black chador held together between her teeth.
``So Iran wins, I win and my son wins most of all.''
</P>
<P>
   For some fans, the victory was a clear sign of divine
intervention _ and a benign United States. ``We prayed hard before
the game,'' said Ahmed Felegari, 23, a construction worker from the
western Iranian city of Kermanshahr. ``We were counting on God
first _ and the players second.
</P>
<P>
   ``America was not the Great Satan tonight. Tonight we were
friends.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not a night for gloating. One Iranian woman stopped and
kissed an American visitor, assuring her that the victory was
nothing personal; another invited the visitor to her home for a
meal. President Mohammed Khatami sent a message of congratulations
to the Iranian team.
</P>
<P>
   But Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's spiritual leader, used Iran's
victory to criticize the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight again the strong and arrogant opponents felt the
bitter taste of defeat at your hands,'' he told the team. ``Be
happy that you have made the Iranian nation happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The impromptu celebration was reminiscent of _ though much
smaller than _ the street celebrations marking Iran's draw with
Australia late last year, which qualified Iran for the World Cup
finals for the first time in 20 years. At that time, masses of
Iranians left their jobs and their homes for exultant
demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Iranian authorities took precautions to prevent any
celebrations _or mourning _ from turning violent. Restaurants in
Tehran were forced to close at 9 p.m. Sports centers were ordered
to cancel plans to show the game on giant outdoor screens, and army
troops and plainclothes policemen were stationed at roadblocks
throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout this soccer-crazed country, Iranians were riveted to
their television screens from the starting kickoff at 11:30 p.m.,
cheering and grumbling as they watched.
</P>
<P>
   To ensure that the coverage was Islamically correct, the
broadcast began seven seconds late, so that Iranian viewers would
not be subjected to the sight of fans in summer dress who might be
drinking alcoholic beverages.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, after three American shots had hit the goal
post, some fans invoked God's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``God is definitely with us tonight, man,'' said Bobak Pasha, a
30-year-old businessman watching with his family. ``Oh, God! Oh, my
God!''
</P>
<P>
   A few miles north, at another family gathering, Sahand Tavakol,
17, a high school student, had a similar reaction. ``Thank God. He
is with us,'' he said as he jumped out of his chair.
</P>
<P>
   When Hamid Reza Estili _ known as the James Bond of Iran _
scored the first goal, Iranians throughout Tehran were
thunderstruck. For one glorious moment, they had overtaken the
United States on at least one playing field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a beautiful goal! What a beautiful goal!'' said Hamid
Salimi, a taxi driver watching the game with his wife and older son
in a poor neighborhood in south Tehran. ``The way he moved his head
_ it's the most beautiful goal in all Europe.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, in good-sport fashion, he added, ``The Americans are
doing their best.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Iranian officials greeted conciliatory words about Iran
this week by President Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright with reserve, many Iranian citizens were delighted, a
delight that was magnified in the magic moment after Iran scored.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   ``I jumped to the ceiling and rammed my fist into the ceiling,''
said Nikol Nasr, an architect. ``My heart's beating, beating,
beating. Me and my dad and mom _ three beating hearts. My father
started to cry. My mom, too. It can be a new beautiful start with
America. We would like to do that. We would love to, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most of Iran's players, and the fans of their
generation, are too young to remember much about the Ayatollah
Ruhollah Khomeini's sermons about the ``crimes of America,'' the
anti-American street chants during the 1979 revolution and the
444-day seizure of the American Embassy in downtown Tehran.
</P>
<P>
   Soccer came to Iran decades ago via the two countries considered
most imperialist here, Britain and the United States. British oil
workers played the game in Abadan, and American and British
missionaries taught the game at their schools.
</P>
<P>
   After the young Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlevi played center forward
at his Swiss boarding school in the 1930s, soccer was elevated from
a street sport to one worthy of the higher classes to play at their
private clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Some leaders of the revolution tried to squelch the sport,
putting players in long pants and arguing about whether the game
was anti-Islamic. But that was difficult to do, because so many
clerics liked the game. Even Khomeini's son, Ahmed, played on a
team in the holy city of Qum.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, as Iran girded itself for this match, Iran's
leaders insisted that it was only a game, not a symbolic playing
out of a political agenda. In honoring an Iranian team that had
climbed Mount Everest, President Khatami said of the upcoming
match: ``For us, victory or failure is normal. The real victory is
that the sportsmen do their best.''

IRAN KNOCKS U.S. OUT OF WORLD CUP COMPETITION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs for rewriting throughout; note corrected spelling of Lyons in
dateline and throughout story) (sw)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   LYONS, France _ The Iranian players shook hands with the
Americans before Sunday night's game, handed them white flowers
symbolizing peace and even posed together for a team picture. But
friendship extended only so far. There was a soccer game to win,
and not only did Iran prevail, 2-1, but this historic victory
knocked the United States out of contention in the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first time that Iran and the United States had met
in soccer and the first time that Iran ever won a game in two trips
to the World Cup. The countries exchanged visits by their
Olympic-style wrestling teams this year, and have participated in
the Summer Games, but this was the most visible head-to-head
sporting event between the two countries since the Islamic
revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   In victory on Sunday night, Iranian players said it was
significant to have defeated the Americans, and not necessarily for
political reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is important after 20 years of situations to show
that the things said about Iranians are not true,'' said goalkeeper
Ahmadreza Abedzadeh. ``We were courageous and we played fair. That
is very important.''
</P>
<P>
   Although soccer's world governing body had feared that
protesters would try to disrupt the game, just the opposite
happened, as fans of both teams seemed to go out of their way to
show that they could be courteous and friendly even if their
governments could not. The only demonstration was a vigorous but
peaceful protest against Iran's Islamic regime, launched by several
thousand Iranian expatriates who smuggled T-shirts and banners into
Gerland Stadium showing the pictures of two leaders of a
Paris-based opposition group called the National Council of
Resistance.
</P>
<P>
   In Tehran, thousands of celebrating fans took to the streets,
some women without their scarves, despite efforts by the Islamic
regime took steps to make sure that the celebration was not as
vociferous as it had been last November when millions took to the
street in spontaneous celebration after Iran qualified for the
World Cup for the first time in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Iranian players said they knew the ordinary people of
Iran would be exultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the greatest game we ever played,'' said the star
forward Khodadad Azizi. ``The whole nation was waiting for this
game and expecting us to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The match was played several days after President Clinton called
for improved relations with Iran after 19 years of enmity between
the two countries, and followed a call in January by Iranian
President Mohammad Khatami for cultural exchanges between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Iran's conservative religious leaders attempted to
use the victory for political purposes. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who
is Iran's ultimate leader, said in a statement broadcast by state
television that ``Tonight, again, the strong and arrogant opponent
felt the bitter taste of defeat at your hands.''
</P>
<P>
   Dissidents also tried to capitalize on the forum by promoting
their resistance group. French police rushed into the stands
several times to confiscate banners and new pictures celebrating
the two leaders of the National Council of Resistance, but new
banners and pictures kept popping up like mushrooms. The opposition
group's influence is considered to be limited inside Iran, but the
size of the protest was undoubtedly an embarrassment to the Islamic
regime.
</P>
<P>
   In the game's most surreal moment, the protesters waved their
T-shirts and banners jubilantly at halftime as the public address
system played the Macarena. About 75 French policemen in riot gear
marched to one side of the field 10 minutes before the game
concluded, but the Iranian fans left peacefully and ecstatically.
</P>
<P>
   While Iran (1-1) is expected to have its hopes of advancing to
the second round dashed on Thursday when it faces powerful Germany,
at least it can dream. The United States, which has lost both its
matches and has scored but one goal in the two games, will now play
Yugoslavia on Thursday in a game that will have meaning only to the
Yugoslavs.
</P>
<P>
   Only the top two teams in the group will advance to the next
round and Germany, Iran and Yugoslavia each have four points, with
each winning a game _ for three points _ and tying one _ for one
point. With no points and only one game remaining, the United
States has no hope.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans cannot match their accomplishment in 1994 of
having advanced to the second round. Given their generally poor
play and inability to put the ball into the net, the 1998 World Cup
will be regarded as a complete failure. Alan Rothenberg, president
of the U.S. soccer federation, called Sunday night's defeat a
``bitter disappointment.''
</P>
<P>
   If the United States were a serious soccer country, Coach Steve
Sampson might have lost his job on Sunday night, as coaches from
Saudi Arabia and South Korea did in recent days. But Rothenberg
said Sampson would coach the team against Yugoslavia. Sampson made
five lineup changes on Sunday night, scrapping the 3-6-1 formation
he had used in the opening 2-0 loss to Germany for a 3-5-2
formation, with Brian McBride and Roy Wegerle at forwards and Tab
Ramos, Frankie Hejduk and Joe-Max Moore assuming roles in midfield.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sampson wanted assertive play in attack after Monday's tentative
loss to Germany and on Sunday night the Americans hit the goalpost
twice and the crossbar once and outshot Iran, 27-15, but could not
score until McBride's header for a goal in the 88th minute. In
fact, the Americans came forward so aggressively, took so many
risks, that they were left completely out of shape on defense.
</P>
<P>
   In the 40th minute, with Claudio Reyna giving him far too much
room, Iran's Hamid Estili headed a ball over the head of American
goalkeeper Kasey Keller to give his team a 1-0 lead. As the crowd
of 35,500, made largely of Iranian fans, erupted, Estili kissed the
ground in celebration.
</P>
<P>
   In the 83rd minute, Mehdi Mahdavikia sprinted past the
disheveled American defense and blasted another goal past Keller.
</P>
<P>
   Sampson faced stern questions about why he kept Eric Wynalda,
the Americans' all-time leading scorer on the bench, but he said,
``I wouldn't change a thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither would Jalal Talebi, the Iranian coach who has lived for
17 years in Palo Alto, Calif., and who took his current job only
four weeks ago after his team floundered with a defensive style.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a big victory,'' he said. ``I don't think the people
were celebrating because we played against the United States. They
were happy because this is the first time we won a game in the
World Cup. Everyone has pride and hope for the future. This was a
unity game.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the game, fans of both teams shook hands and stood
together for pictures, draped in each other's flags, both in Lyons'
sunbaked plazas and outside Gerland Stadium. In a gesture of
friendship, some fans even wore red, white and blue hats
celebrating the United States and red, green and white jerseys hats
celebrating Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought I'd be wearing an Iranian flag in my cap,''
said David Mebane, 22, an accountant from Austin, Texas, as he
posed with Iranian fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has changed my attitude toward the people of Iran, from
an image of uneducated guys chanting and flag burning to an image
of people who are peaceful and more than friendly. I'm thoroughly
impressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Jalali, a native of Iran who has lived for 25 years in San
Francisco, where he works as a civil engineer said any victory
would be for the Iranian people, not the Islamic regime. On Sunday
he wore an American handkerchief flag for a cap and an Iranian
jersey.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Islamic regime has deprive Iranians of every moment of joy
and happiness,'' Jalali said. ``This shows were are still alive, we
are humans. My children in the past were humiliated to say they
were Iranian. Now they are proud. This happiness has been brought
by the soccer team. ``
</P>
<P>
   Security was heavy in the blocks surrounding the stadium. And
French police confiscated flags of the Iranian opposition, which
showed a lion and a sun in the white field of the tricolor instead
of the religious symbol of Allah. The National Council of
Resistance called the confiscations ``insulting'' and criticized
governments of both Iran and the United States of attempting to use
the game for political benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I saw, but I did not care,'' said Talebi, the Iranian
coach. ``I was not looking at the protesters; I was looking at my
team. It is not good to ask a sportsman a political question.''

months after arriving from Sri Lanka. Because no children are
allowed in the Queens detention center in New York, Rajakumar was
sent to a center for juveniles in Miami. ``I cried and cried and
cried,'' says Mrs. Kadambarathnam. In New York, asylum seekers are
routinely kept in detention for months until a judge hears their

that new development, including a four-story shopping plaza planned
for the center of the row, threatens the last vestiges of the old
life. Cannery Row first came to the attention of the National Trust
for Historic Preservation last year, during a battle over the fate
of the San Xavier Warehouse, one of the few remaining buildings

Rebels vow to fight to the death, and their leaders insist that
they can defend their positions. The United States, in an effort to
stay the hand of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, has
threatened NATO intervention unless the soldiers are withdrawn from
the province and negotiations with a moderate ethnic Albanian
leader, Ibrahim Rugova, are resumed. (Wade Goddard/New York Times

dismissed because of fabrications in her work. The disclosure that
Ms. Smith had concocted people and quotes in at least four columns
earlier this year was particularly dramatic, given that it became
public just a week after The New Republic concluded that Stephen
Glass, a staff writer, fabricated all or part of 27 of the 41
articles he wrote for the magazine in two and a half years. Still,
editors say incidents of fakery remain few. (Stan Grossfeld/Boston

which brought computer-style information to the video genre. ``It's
a niche business,'' says Sykes. ``Our parents more or less gave up
their dominance of the record-buying business when they got into
having children and mortgages,'' he says. But for the baby boom
generation, there has always been a passionate connection to

build an audience for 2008.'' says Paul Kellogg, the general and

Paul Kellogg, the general and artistic director of the New York
City Opera. In his career, Kellogg, 60, has taken more risks than
most, emboldened by his belief in untapped audiences. ``People are
out there who don't know Puccini's 'Boheme' from Britten's 'Paul
Bunyan,''' he says. ``And they're just as likely to come to the
Britten, if they think that it be fresh and intriguing.'' These are
the people who, in other areas, Kellogg adds, first gravitate to
new movies, and new plays, before looking to the past. ``And I
think I'm reaching them.'' (Sara Krulwich/New York Times Photo)

allowed in the Queens detention center in New York, Rajakumar was

cried,'' says Mrs. Kadambarathnam. In New York, asylum seekers are
routinely kept in detention for months until a judge hears their
case. (Philip Greenberg/New York Times Photo)

Paul Kellogg, the general and artistic director of the New York
City Opera. In his career, Kellogg, 60, has taken more risks than
most, emboldened by his belief in untapped audiences. ``People are
out there who don't know Puccini's 'Boheme' from Britten's 'Paul
Bunyan,''' he says. ``And they're just as likely to come to the
Britten, if they think that it be fresh and intriguing.'' These are
the people who, in other areas, Kellogg adds, first gravitate to
new movies, and new plays, before looking to the past. ``And I
think I'm reaching them.'' (Sara Krulwich/New York Times Photo)

JANZEN WINS HIS SECOND U.S. OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDS: This is a photo refer to page 1 of the New York Times.)  
(See also GLF-NOTEBOOK, GLF-ANDERSON-COLUMN) 
(ja) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A few moments after realizing he had won the
U.S. Open Sunday, Lee Janzen wept. Who could blame him? The last
four days at the Olympic Club had been emotional, grueling and
relentlessly challenging, so difficult that nobody finished the
tournament under par.
</P>
<P>
   Even after Janzen made a phenomenal charge _ he trailed by seven
strokes after the first three holes Sunday, and made four birdies
over the final 14 holes _ the torture was not over. He had to sit
helplessly and wait in the clubhouse as Payne Stewart lined up a
20-foot birdie attempt at No. 18. If the putt had fallen, Janzen
and Stewart would have played an 18-hole playoff Monday. For
Janzen, a Monday playoff would have at least have been better than
sudden death Sunday. After his final round, Janzen's knees were
weak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't have played another hole,'' Janzen said.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't have to. Stewart, who led for three days only to fall
agonizingly short, barely missed his putt for birdie at No. 18. It
broke right to left and slid just a few inches in front of the
hole, closing the door on Stewart and starting the tears for
Janzen. As he was hugged by his wife, Beverly, Janzen could finally
exhale. For the second time in his career, he was a U.S. Open
champion, adding to his 1993 championship at Baltusrol and taking
home the first-place check of $535,000.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the circumstances, the comeback and the difficult
course on which he prevailed, this one-stroke victory was the
sweetest of Janzen's career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went out and played my absolute best golf, and I won the
championship that I love more than any other,'' said Janzen, who
shot even-par 280 (73-68-73-68) for the tournament to defeat
Stewart by one stroke, while Bob Tway finished third. ``I feel very
fortunate to play golf for a living. And to win the U.S. Open is
the ultimate.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a crushing defeat for Stewart, the 1991 Open champion,
who led after each of the first three rounds and who still led by
five strokes after his first three holes Sunday. But few
final-round leads are safe at Olympic, the same course where Arnold
Palmer lost a seven-stroke lead on the back nine to Billy Casper
during the 1966 Open.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart shot his worst round of the tournament Sunday (74), and
after his birdie attempt on No. 18 missed, he admitted that he did
not play well enough to win. It was a familiar feeling for Stewart,
who also finished second to Janzen in the 1993 Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I bring out the best in Lee Janzen,'' said Stewart,
who handled the defeat with class. ``You have to give him credit.
He was the only one of the contenders to shoot under par today, and
he deserved to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't make enough putts. I didn't hit enough fairways. I'm
disappointed, but life goes on.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Asked about his birdie attempt at No. 18, Stewart said, ``I
thought I chose the right line, but it was just a little bit off.''
And that was enough to give the victory to Janzen, who overcame a
difficult start with a tremendous finish. Starting the day at 2
over par, five strokes behind Stewart, Janzen made a final-round
comeback that was a portrait of poise and perseverance. He bogeyed
No. 2 and No. 3 to fall to 4 over par, while Stewart was still at 3
under. Some players would start to think about second place at that
point, but not Janzen. He made an important putt for birdie at No.
3, then got a huge break at No. 5, after his tee shot got stuck in
a tree.
</P>
<P>
   As Janzen was walking back to take another tee shot, which would
have also cost him a penalty stroke, the ball dropped out of the
tree. Janzen returned to his ball, then, after reaching the back of
the green in three shots, chipped in from about 20 feet to save
par. And he felt the momentum might be changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking about a double-bogey, but instead I chipped in
for par,'' said Janzen. ``That was huge.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Stewart was faltering. He bogeyed No. 4 and No. 7,
making the turn for the back nine at just 1 under par for the
tournament. Then when Janzen birdied No. 11 and No. 13 to pull to
even par for the tournament, Stewart had only a one-stroke lead.
Things got worse for Stewart at No. 12, when his tee shot landed in
a fairway sand divot. Stewart said he had always felt that a player
who hits in a sand divot should be given a free drop, instead of
playing the ball from the divot.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's ground under repair,'' said Stewart. ``But the USGA and
the PGA Tour don't see it like that.'' Stewart's shot out of the
divot landed in the greenside bunker, and he failed to get up and
down for par, missing a 10-foot putt as Janzen walked down the 15th
fairway. Suddenly, the tournament was even, and Stewart was also
angry about a warning for slow play that he received after his shot
out of the divot on No. 12. ``That didn't sit very well with me,''
said Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   When Stewart bogeyed No. 13, Janzen had the lead for the first
time in the tournament. But Stewart responded with a birdie at No.
14 to even the tournament again. By this time, Tway and Tom Lehman,
who finished tied for fifth at 286, had already fallen out of
contention, while Nick Price, who finished fourth at 285, never
made a charge. It was a two-man race between Stewart and Janzen.
And Stewart made his final costly mistake, a bogey at the par-5 No.
16 to fall one stroke back, when he hit his third shot into a
bunker, chipped to 15 feet and then missed the putt.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, shortly before Stewart finished at No. 16, Janzen
made a crucial par at the treacherous 17th hole, a hole that Janzen
double-bogeyed on both Friday and Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Janzen, 33, who lives in Orlando, Fla., said, ``I didn't want
that hole to cost me the championship.''
</P>
<P>
   After Janzen made par at No. 18, he had to wait for Stewart, who
made par at 17 and then fell short at 18. But for Janzen, the wait
was worth it. He had not won on the PGA Tour since 1995, and he had
moments when he doubted himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longer you go, the more you ask yourself if you will ever
win,'' Janzen said. ``I just kept telling myself that I would.''
Janzen does not have to question himself any longer. A tournament
that will be remembered for its drama and difficulty had a worthy
winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Payne missed his putt, I guess that was the first time I
realized that it was over,'' said Janzen. ``It's a great feeling.
For me, this is the ultimate.''

YEN WEAKENS A BIT; JAPANESE STOCKS ARE STABLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SHERYL WUDUNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Just two days before President Clinton departs for
China, financial markets in Asia reacted cautiously to political
and diplomatic efforts over the weekend to stabilize Asia's
currencies, in particular the Japanese yen.
</P>
<P>
   The yen dipped modestly in value against the dollar in early
Tokyo trading Monday, as currency traders showed some
disappointment that Japan offered only promises, but no specific
measures, to revive its severely weakened economy.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese currency weakened to 137.35 to the dollar, from
136.10 yen in New York on Friday, erasing just a bit of the gains
brought about by the intervention of the United States and Japan
last week. Before the intervention, the yen had reached 144 to the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese stocks were also stable, with the Nikkei index of 225
issues up 12.34, to 15,280.32, at midmorning.
</P>
<P>
   Traders were wary in selling off the yen because of fears that
the United States and Japan will intervene in the currency markets
again, as they did on Wednesday, to prop up the Japanese currency.
They also seem to be concerned about being on the wrong side of a
bet if Japan does take steps to strengthen its economy and the yen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe people's thinking has grown up a little and they realize
this is not going to happen overnight,'' said Richard Jerram,
economist at ING Barings Securities (Japan) Ltd., referring to the
process of reviving Japan's economy. ``It's going to take the next
few months.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is skeptical'' of Japan's commitment to introduce
structural change, he said, adding: ``But if they do deliver, it's
so huge that a currency-negative approach would be costly.''
</P>
<P>
   At a hastily called meeting Saturday of delegates from the Group
of Seven industrialized nations and 10 Asian nations, Japan
reitererated its commitment to clean up the nation's bad banking
loans and to take steps to revive its economy. But despite
expectations, Japan offered no new or concrete plans.
</P>
<P>
   In what appeared to be an attempt to fend off an attack on the
yen, Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto held an emergency meeting
Monday morning on the nation's bad banking loans with Koichi Kato,
the secretary general of the governing Liberal Democratic Party.
The meeting came as newspapers reported that a large Japanese bank,
the Long-Term Credit Bank, which is saddled with billions of
dollars in bad loans, was desperately looking for a rescue merger
to escape collapse.
</P>
<P>
   A further rapid decline of the yen would threaten financial
stability in Asia and could escalate the economic turmoil in the
region to a new level, particularly if China moved to devalue its
currency.
</P>
<P>
   Asian leaders have been unnerved by the prospect of China
devaluing its currency. A devaluation by China could lead to a
round of devaluations around the region, as other countries aim to
cheapen their exports, which have been a main source of recovery in
Asia.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton said on Friday that the impact of currency
instability on China played an important role in the decision by
United States authorities to intervene and support the value of the
yen last week.
</P>
<P>
   China itself seems to have tried to bring about some coordinated
response on the decline of the yen and had publicly voiced concern
over the tumbling yen in the last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In previous months, China had repeatedly pledged to the
international community that it would not devalue its currency to
support its exports. But as the yen tumbled in the last couple of
weeks, Dai Xianglong, China's central bank governor, suggested once
that China may be wavering in that commitment.
</P>
<P>
   But some economists point out that it is also not fully in the
interests of China to devalue its currency because a game of
competitive devaluations would erode profits in China as well as
everywhere else. China, for instance, has a substantial amount of
loans in United States dollars, so that any devaluation would
immediately make those loans more expensive to pay back.
</P>
<P>
   Partly for that reason, some economists have downplayed the role
that a potential Chinese currency devaluation played in the
decision last week by U.S. authorities to intervene to support the
yen.

FANS CONSPIRE TO MAKE `X-FILES' WEEKEND BOX OFFICE KING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- ``The X-Files'' transformed itself impressively
from small to big screen with an estimated $31.3 million at 2,626
theaters nationwide during the Friday-Sunday period, studio sources
said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   20th Century Fox's eerie action-drama easily beat a solid
showing from ``Mulan,'' Disney's 36th animated feature, which had
$23 million at 2,888 sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``X-Files,'' with stars David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson as
FBI agents probing the paranormal implications of a Dallas building
explosion, posted the seventh-highest June opening ever and
performed in line or slightly better than forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're thrilled,'' said Tom Sherak, head of Fox's domestic
movie arm. ``This is one of those peaks in the peaks and valleys of
the business.''
</P>
<P>
   The executive said ``X-Files'' drew equally between men and
women. Strongest support came from young males, with more than 75
percent saying they would recommend the movie, Sherak said.
</P>
<P>
   Publicity for ``The X-Files'' stressed that the film would
resolve major questions raised during the five seasons of the TV
series. The key challenge for the studio will be to draw non-fans
of the series, Sherak said, noting that one-quarter of its weekend
audience came from that group.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said ``X-Files'' and ``Mulan'' _ both launched amid
mixed reviews _ had performed well amid strong holdover
competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fox and Disney have to be happy with the openings,'' said
Arthur Rockwell of Drake Capital Securities. ``Both of these were
somewhat risky projects in terms of widespread audience appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bucksbaum, head of Reel Source tracking service, said
``X-Files,'' which carried a $63 million price tag, should wind up
with $125 million to $140 million domestically. He also said its
success won't necessarily lead to more movies based on TV shows.
</P>
<P>
   `` &UR;  &LR; `X-Files' is pretty unique because most other TV properties
do not have the constantly changing locales you need to take the
show to the next level and make a successful movie,'' Bucksbaum
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mulan,'' based on a Chinese folk tale of a young woman posing
as her father to fight an invasion, beat last year's $21.5 million
opening of Disney's previous animated project, ``Hercules,'' and
the $22 million total taken in after six weeks by Warner Bros.'
animated ``The Quest for Camelot.''
</P>
<P>
   The debut signals that Disney's status as the kingpin of
animation is likely to continue even amid stepped-up efforts by
rivals.
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum said ``Mulan'' drew well among adult women and should
go slightly past ``Hercules' &UR;  &LR; '' $100 million domestic total. The
movie, which carried a $90 million production cost, is expected to
perform well in overseas markets and generate solid profits.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's third weekend of ``The Truman Show'' came in third
with $12.4 million at 2,911 theaters, giving the comedy-fantasy
more than $85 million in 17 days. Disney's second weekend of ``Six
Days, Seven Nights'' followed, with a respectable $10.5 million at
2,579 theaters, to go past $34 million in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Warner's third weekend of ``A Perfect Murder'' finished fifth
with $7.3 million at 2,755 locations. ``The top holdover films have
very respectable legs,'' Rockwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's second weekend of the teen-comedy ``Can't Hardly Wait''
came in sixth with a disappointing $3.9 million at 1,987 sites as
it lost more than half its debut audience. Fox's fourth weekend of
``Hope Floats'' followed with $3.1 million at 1,872 theaters to top
$44 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sony's fifth weekend of ``Godzilla'' continued its fast fade in
eighth with $3 million at 2,337 theaters, followed by Paramount's
seventh weekend of ``Deep Impact'' with $2.7 million at 1,972
sites. The latter is the top grosser among movies released in 1998
with $133.1 million, giving it 79th place on the all-time domestic
list behind ``The Rock'' at $134 million.
</P>
<P>
   It's probable that ``Deep Impact'' will outgross ``Godzilla,''
now with $129.2 million at 83rd place on the all-time list, behind
``An Officer and a Gentleman.''
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the top 10 was Disney's sixth weekend of ``The
Horse Whisperer'' with $2.4 million at 1,852 theaters to reach
nearly $63 million.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's other major opening, Miramax's romantic comedy
``Hav Plenty,'' flopped with $1.1 million at 1,413 theaters as
moviegoers ignored Scot Cherot's tale of a tough-luck
African-American writer in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend also marked the first in 27 that Paramount's
``Titanic'' finished out of the top 10. The epic still grossed a
respectable $1 million at 810 sites and has now taken in $585.5
million after 185 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Titanic'' leads ``Star Wars'' as best domestic grosser by $124
million.
</P>
<P>
   Overall business was about equal to the same weekend last year
when ``Batman &AMP; Robin'' opened with $42.9 million, followed by ``My
Best Friend's Wedding'' with $21.7 million in its debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``The X-Files'' will face competition during the upcoming
weekend from Fox's opening of ``Dr. Dolittle'' with Eddie Murphy
and Universal's action-comedy ``Out of Sight'' with George Clooney.
New Line will re-release a restored version of ``Gone With the
Wind'' in about 200 theaters.

FEE FRENZY _ CUSTOMERS CAN STEER CLEAR OF BANK CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER SINTON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
U.S. banks are making record profits, and one reason is because
they're imposing more and higher fees on customers.
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a ``fee frenzy,'' notes Bob McKinley, president of RAM
Research Corp. which tracks the credit card industry. ``Many
consumers are paying less in interest payments but they are getting
nickeled and dimed to death by fees.''
</P>
<P>
   For example:
</P>
<P>
   _ The average fee for a bounced check is now $21.36, up from
$20.80 last October, according to a March survey of 350 U.S. banks
by Bank Rate Monitor.
</P>
<P>
   _ Eight of the Top 10 banks charge noncustomers who use their
automated teller machines, and 55 percent of all U.S. banks impose
such surcharges, up from 48 percent in October.
</P>
<P>
   _ Late payment and over-the-limit fees on credit cards have each
jumped from an average of $13 to about $20 in just 18 months,
according to RAM Research.
</P>
<P>
   Some big banks including Fleet, First Union and Mellon now
charge as much as $25 to close a credit card account. Others charge
a $15 dormancy fee on accounts that are inactive for six months. If
you get a cash advance on a credit card, expect to pay up to 5
percent of the withdrawn amount in fees.
</P>
<P>
   Banks still make more money on interest income _ the spread
between what they charge on loans and what they pay on deposits _
than on customer fees.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But the interest-rate spread is narrowing, as banks face
growing competition from brokerage firms and mutual funds for
customer assets.
</P>
<P>
   To gain and retain customers, banks are offering promotional
interest rates. That has helped lower the interest-rate spread to a
seven-year low of 4.06 percent.
</P>
<P>
   To make up for smaller spreads, banks are raising old fees and
coming up with new ones. As a result, fee income is rising four
times faster than interest income and now accounts for nearly 40
percent of bank income compared to about 32 percent a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; On balance, banks are still raking it in. In the first quarter
of this year, U.S. bank profits soared 10 percent over the previous
year to a record $15.9 billion, according to the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corp.
</P>
<P>
   With sophisticated computer systems, banks can now track the
profitability of each account and each customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Banks want all customers to pay their way,'' McKinley
explained. ``They are chipping away at grace periods and looking
for freeloaders and deadbeats.''
</P>
<P>
   This makes financial sense but it hasn't exactly enhanced the
image of bankers.
</P>
<P>
   The percentage of customers who were ``very satisfied'' with
their banks declined to 54 percent last year from 65 percent in
1994, according to a Gallup poll commissioned by the American
Bankers Association.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; Consumers were particularly offended by fees. Only 12 percent
of bank customers strongly agreed that fees paid are for ``good
value'' received. And 60 percent of those who don't use a bank
cited fees as a major reason for taking their business elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Since most of us do use banks, here are some steps you can take
to avoid fees.
</P>
<P>
   _ Look at your choices.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Despite all the mergers, there are still more than 9,000
commercial U.S. banks. There also are savings and loans,
brokerages, mutual funds and other options for financial service.
</P>
<P>
   The 300 biggest banks often offer greater convenience and bigger
ATM networks than their smaller competitors &UR; . &LR;  But on average, they
impose 15 percent higher fees for deposit accounts than smaller
banks, according to U.S. Public Interest Research Group.
</P>
<P>
   Not one of the 50 largest U.S. banks offered any of the 10
cheapest checking accounts, Bank Rate Monitor reported last month.
</P>
<P>
   Banks that offered the most expensive accounts in March were
Citibank of San Francisco and NationsBank, which recently agreed to
buy Bank of America, according Florida-based Bank Rate Monitor.
</P>
<P>
   _ Play by the rules and read the fine print.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are plenty of financial land mines, but there are also
ways around them,'' said McKinley of RAM Research. He and others
advise paying bills on time, not going over credit limits and
following other procedures to avoid fees.
</P>
<P>
   Marin building contractor William Kopiecki said he reads monthly
statements carefully and raises a ruckus if there's a problem. He
recently noticed that it took eight to 11 days for two checks he
wrote totaling $15,500 to be credited to his account at MBNA after
they were debited from his account at Citibank. After spotting the
long lag and complaining to Citibank, he was assured he would get
much of his lost interest returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless you complain, they're going to try to have the maximum
float with your money,'' said Kopiecki. ``I guess eternal vigilence
is the cost of financial liberty.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Only pay for services you need.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, if you rarely visit a teller, opt for an account
that offers unlimited checking, low minimum balance requirements
and low or no monthly fees as long as you bank by ATM, phone or
personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   If you have one of these accounts and do end up using a live
teller when you could have used an ATM, you'll pay a fee that is
usually about $3 but could be as much as $9.50, according to Bank
Rate Monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Even for full-service accounts, banks will often reduce or
eliminate fees if you maintain multiple accounts, keep a minimum
balance like $1,000 in your checking account or sign up for direct
deposit of your paycheck or Social Security payments.
</P>
<P>
   _ Use plastic wisely.
</P>
<P>
   Credit card users who do not pay off their monthly balances
should take advantage of promotional or ``teaser'' rates. When the
teaser rate expires and the rate shoots into double digits, switch
to another credit card or try to negotiate a lower rate on your
existing one.
</P>
<P>
   The best credit card strategy is to pay off your bills each
month, thereby benefitting from use of the money (or float) during
the free grace period and no interest or fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby Boomers are getting smarter; they're looking for a free
ride,'' said McKinley. ``That's not the way it used to be.'' Almost
40 percent of credit card customers are now ``convenience'' users
who pay off their bills each month. That's up from 29 percent six
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Web sites that carry information on checking and credit card
rates and fees include Bank Rate Monitor (www.bankrate.com), RAM
Research (www.ramresearch.com) and Consumers' Checkbook
(www.checkbook.org).

 U.S. BLEW CHANCE TO ADVANCE SPORT (For use
by NYTimes News Service clients) By GIL LEBRETON c.1998 Fort Worth
Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; P &QR; RSatan,S just like in MatthewUs gospel, was foiled again
yesterday.
 &QL; P &QR; Hopefully for U.S. soccer, this humbling wonUt end up in
someoneUs sermon
2,000 years from now.  &QL; P &QR; For the proud niche of soccer fans in the
United States, there should be
comfort in knowing that their grand game did not disgrace the
nation yesterday in Lyon, France.  &QL; P &QR; No. By the time that the clock
ran out on IranUs 2-1 victory, much of the
American viewing audience was either (A) napping or (B) watching
golf on TV.  &QL; P &QR; Ten years of trying to pick up the game by its
kneesocks, of bidding for
and then successfully staging the U94 World Cup, of trying to build
a U.S. team that could earn respect on the world stage Q and this
is what they get?  &QL; P &QR; In Iran, where they once referred to us as
RThe Great Satan,S the victory
prompted midnight prayers and dancing in the streets. The Iranians
scored two goals, but huge points more for their sportsmanship and
the heart that they showed.  &QL; P &QR; Here at home, alas, it was hard to
swallow. In terms of a future Q read
Rcorporate dollarsS Q the defeat may not have delivered a death
blow to soccer in this country. But at the moment, consider it down
and bleeding.  &QL; P &QR; For one day, soccer had the U.S. viewing audience
mostly to itself. People
who didnUt know a soccer ball from a frozen ham suddenly had a
storyline they could sink their teeth into. A Ted Koppel kind of
game. To a lot of Americans, still, mention of Iran brings back
memories of the hostage crisis, the Ayatollah Khomeini and U.S.
flags being burned in the Tehran streets.  &QL; P &QR; And what? You said
Team USA was heavily favored?
 &QL; P &QR; You bet they watched.
 &QL; P &QR; But it was more of the same, wasnUt it? The U.S. playersU
inability to put
the ball in the net turned into a night of frustration. They hit
the crossbar. They hit the goalposts Q three times. And now, after
one more World Cup match, they will hit the road.  &QL; P &QR; Spare the
e-mails, please. TheyUve become trite.
 &QL; P &QR; After I penned a fairly light-hearted piece 12 days ago, teasing
how the
World Cup gets lost in the U.S. translation, I received a spate of
electronic dispatches rife with name-calling and high-handed piety.
 &QL; P &QR; Ron Pitney of Arlington wrote, RYour refusal to learn the game
amounts to
intellectual bankruptcy and until you take the time to really
understand the Tgame within the gameU you really should limit your
comments to those sports you understand!S  &QL; P &QR; Ah, yes, the Rgame
within the gameS of soccer. At least two of the e-mail
writers claimed that soccer is now the preferred sport of
Rintelligent people,S and thus they understood perfectly why only
they grasped its nuances Q and, apparently, I didnUt.  &QL; P &QR; While they
were memorizing Chaucer, I suppose, they must have missed the
fact that nowhere in the earlier column did I say I didnUt like
soccer, the apparent Official Game of Mensa. I simply strove to
make points about the World CupUs lack of scoring, particularly the
U.S. teamUs. And while praising World Cup U94 for its success,
despite the rest of the worldUs skepticism, I noted how the great
event still doesnUt captivate the same throngs on our shores.
 &QL; P &QR; Suddenly, I think I was on the same mailing list as Salman
Rushdie.
 &QL; P &QR; RYou people are morons if you canUt see that soccer is HUGE with
an
educated segment of the population,S read one of the unsigned
notes.  &QL; P &QR; I give up. What donUt we morons understand?
 &QL; P &QR; ThereUs offsides. ThereUs corner kicks. There are yellow cards
and red
cards. Soccer is not rocket science. As has been proven many times
at the World Cup, the coaches donUt even need to speak the playersU
language.  &QL; P &QR; The best e-mail comment, as it turned out, came from a
truly erudite
gentleman named Norm Biven. He called my attention to the
commercial that Nike is running during the Cup telecasts. It shows
the defending world champs from Brazil stuck during a flight delay
at the Rio airport. They begin playing with the soccer ball, while
a samba from Sergio Mendes plays in the background.  &QL; P &QR; They and the
ball go through X-ray machines, under taxiing jet wings, down
baggage ramps, before the worldUs best player, Ronaldo, finishes
with a footwork exhibition that would make the Globetrotters
envious. The punch line is that Ronaldo gets to the terminal gate,
kicks Q and clangs it off the metal post.  &QL; P &QR; The kids watching
frown. Ronaldo shrugs.
 &QL; P &QR; RJust because RonaldoUs shot clangs off the post at the end
doesnUt make it
any less entertaining,S Biven wrote. RItUs not the scoring. ItUs
the samba, silly.S  &QL; P &QR; I know. But again, thanks to days like
yesterday, it gets lost in the
translation.  &QL; P &QR; Americans love underdogs, but they enjoy winning
more. The samba is fine,
but the preferred tune, last time I checked, was  &QL; I &QR; We Will Rock
You. &QL; P &QR; 
TennisU Davis Cup was big once here, too Q until the United States
started losing it.  &QL; P &QR; U.S. soccer blew it big time yesterday. It
doesnUt take a genius to see
that itUs going to be a tough four years.

FEW TELLER MACHINES ARE EARNING THEIR KEEP 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER SINTON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
It has been 30 years since the first automated teller machine was
introduced in Philadelphia. Touted as the high-tech tonic needed to
cure long teller lines, lure new customers and bolster bank profits
at the same time, ATMs have indeed become a consumer hit.
<TEXT>
<P>
   There are about 165,000 ATMs in the United States and they
handle 900 million transaction a month, or nearly double the number
a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the publicity about ATM fees, cash machines have yet
to be the financial windfall so many banks expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Few of them earn their keep,'' concludes a recent report on
ATMs by the McKinsey &AMP; Co. &UR;  &LR; consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   An average-sized bank might spend $20 million to $25 million a
year on a network of 1,000 ATMs, according to McKinsey. That's a
net cost of $20,000 to $25,000 per machine after taking into
account fees charged to customers and other banks.
</P>
<P>
   It's not surprising that ATMs are expensive to buy, maintain and
keep stocked. Average annual operating costs per machine, including
transaction processing expenses, depreciation and maintenance, run
about $41,000 per year. But total revenue is only about $18,000,
according to McKinsey.
</P>
<P>
   That's a shortfall of $23,000 per machine which banks are trying
to reduce by selling products such as stamps and imposing
transaction fees.
</P>
<P>
   The main problem with cash machine economics is that ATMs have
not produced the expected personnel savings or branch closures.
``On the contrary, the total number of transactions has continued
to rise while the number of branches has increased over the past
decade by a compound rate of 2 percent per year,'' McKinsey
reports.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an unprecedented wave of mega-mergers, there are still
more than 9,000 U.S. commercial banks and the number of branches
actually climbed from 41,881 in 1984 to 59,091 last year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1985, &UR;  &LR; McKinsey consultant Asheet Mehta said it cost banks
$11.60 per month to serve the average retail customer for 6.3
transactions, including 4.4 visits to the bank and 1.9 visits to an
ATM. In 1993, it cost $14.80 to serve the average customer for 10.8
transactions a month, including 3.3 at an ATM and 5.3 inside the
bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Banks have not realized the cost savings they were supposed to
by moving into electronic channels,'' said Mehta. ``They have been
able to shut down branches because of mergers but not because of
ATMs or other electronic delivery channels.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, U.S. commercial banks spent $20 billion on technology
and by the year 2000 the annual investment is expected to hit $25
billion. It is true that serving customers with new technology
helps lower transaction costs. For example, Mehta says it costs
banks an average of $2.50 if you talk to a teller versus 40 cents
if you use an ATM, 24 cents if you use a telephone voice response
unit and 10 cents if you bank by PC.
</P>
<P>
   But banking by technology instead of human touch isn't free.
Banks increasingly charge to use machines at remote sites. These
fees range from an average of 88 cents at convenience stores to
$2.33 at casinos. McKinsey notes that another option to bolster
revenues and cover costs is ``time of day'' pricing _ the
equivalent of charging drivers higher tolls during commute hours.
</P>
<P>
   Some banks, including Wells Fargo, sell stamps for an 11 percent
markup as well as ski-lift and other tickets to help make ends
meet.
</P>
<P>
   But the most controversial ATM fee has been the so-called
foreign bank surcharge levied by financial institutions against
noncustomers who use their machines.
</P>
<P>
   Banks stress that they are not public utilities, that no one is
forced to use their ATMs and they are entitled to charge for the
convenience they offer. Nevertheless, there has been an outcry
against surcharges and Senate Banking Committee Chairman Alfonse
D'Amato, R-N.Y.) has even called for a ban against them.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, Mehta predicts, ``There will be a steep decline
in the number of ATMs and this will reduce consumer choice
dramatically.''

FLORIDA KEYS RESTRICT USE OF NOISY WATERCRAFT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMORADA, Fla. _ Surrounded by a forest of West Indian
hardwood and exquisitely blue waterways, Juanita Greene's
efficiency cottage in Key Largo seemed an idyllic place in which to
pass her retirement years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I planned to live my life out in the Keys,'' said Ms. Greene,
74, a retired newspaper reporter, ``but the Jet Skis drove me
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   So less than two months ago, she moved to the greater Miami
area, to a neighborhood she describes as quiet and peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   To Ms. Greene, it was not so much that one of the jet-powered
watercraft commonly known by brands like Jet Ski, nearly hit her
and her granddaughter while they were swimming. She said it was the
``high-pitched whine'' they made as they roared along the coastline
that shattered her quiet existence.
</P>
<P>
   Now, new regulations governing the use of the personal
watercraft in the Keys, one of the United States' most popular
water-sports locations, seek to prevent other residents from
following Ms. Greene's example.
</P>
<P>
   On June 10, the Monroe County Commission approved an ordinance
that prohibits operating the craft within 1,200 feet of 14 beaches
and resort spots from Key West to Key Largo. The personal
watercraft moored on such shores must idle out to the perimeter
area at speeds of about five miles an hour to avoid making waves
and noise.
</P>
<P>
   Personal watercraft require no licenses and are popular among
young people and tourists, who critics say often lack experience in
handling the vehicles. The ordinance ``is primarily supposed to
protect human life,'' said Keith Douglass, a county commissioner
who introduced the proposal. ``However, it also goes to protecting
their quality of life.''
</P>
<P>
   But Karen Lee, an environmental advocate who pushed for curbs on
personal watercraft, said the measure covers only 2 percent of the
shoreline of the Keys. Although some of it is residential, other
parts are wildlife sanctuaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you start regulating on someone's perception on quality
of life, you are not thinking on a rational basis,'' said Peggy
Mathews, the Florida representative of the Personal Watercraft
Industry Association.
</P>
<P>
   The association, which represents five manufacturers of personal
watercraft, plans to file suit in a federal court asking that the
ordinance be repealed, Ms. Mathews said. She would not disclose the
terms of the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Some areas, like Duck Key, have asked to have their waters
included in the ordinance, and the County Commission will review
those requests next month.
</P>
<P>
   The state of Florida has already banned personal watercraft in
several areas, including the Everglades, but similar restrictions
in the tourist-dependent Keys have met strong opposition. The
islands have 65,000 permanent residents but about 3 million
tourists each year. The recent vote followed two years of studies
and heated debate that pitted some who favored a ban on the
watercraft against industry representatives who opposed curbs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One in every three new boats sold in the country is a personal
watercraft, the Boat Owners Association of the United States said.
Last year, more than 36 percent of recreational boating accidents
in Florida involved personal watercraft, compared with less than 15
percent in 1990, according to the Florida Marine Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   Industry representatives in the Keys have said that personal
watercraft should face the same rules as other watercraft rather
than being singled out. They have maintained that education is the
best way to ensure that such watercraft are used in a safe and less
obtrusive way.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mathews, the industry representative, said manufacturers
would begin next year to produce lines of vehicles that make about
50 percent less noise. But, she added, personal watercraft already
meet federal and state sound regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Jack London of Monroe County, which comprises the Keys,
said the new ordinance might be extended to compel businesses that
rent personal watercraft to require that customers demonstrate
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Among those applauding any restrictions on personal watercraft
are the local fishermen, whose prey _ redfish, bonefish and tarpon
_ are frightened from their grasp every time a personal watercraft
turns the still, shallow sea-grass flats where they dwell into the
equivalent of a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``God bless them for issuing that ordinance,'' said John
Wildeman, 51, a fisherman and boat captain. ``A guy could be out
for hours stalking fish, trying to get within catching distance for
half an hour and those Jet Skiers come. They'll come up and say,
`How's the fish?' I say, `How was the fish.'''

 CLARK ON A ROLL (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) By JOHNNY PAUL c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; P &QR; Will ClarkUs reaching 100 runs batted in this season remains
a distinct
possibility for the Rangers first baseman.  &QL; P &QR; RIt would be nice,
but thatUs not something I came into the season looking
to do,S said Clark, who entered last nightUs game against the
Angels with 42 RBI through the RangersU first 73 games. RObviously,
itUs going to be tough when youUve got a guy hitting in front of
you on pace to drive in 190.S  &QL; P &QR; Right fielder Juan Gonzalez no
doubt diminishes the likelihood of Clark
reaching that plateau for the first time in the past seven seasons.
Clark drove in 116 runs for the San Francisco Giants in 1991.
 &QL; P &QR; Nevertheless, Clark Q who hits primarily fifth in the RangersU
lineup Q is
on pace to drive in 93 runs this season.  &QL; P &QR; Rangers manager Johnny
Oates utilized Clark as his designated hitter last
night for the second consecutive game. Clark continues to
experience discomfort in his left elbow.  &QL; P &QR; RHis left arm is not
100 percent,S Oates said. RWeUre getting ready to go
to a National League park [Wednesday], so I thought this was a good
time for this. ItUs just precautionary. I could have played him at
first base [last night].S &LR; subheds:Oliver ready  &LR; hel9.6:The Rangers
expect left-hander Darren Oliver to make his scheduled start Friday
against the Giants in San Francisco.  &QL; P &QR; Oliver, whom the Rangers
placed on the 15-day disabled list June 13
(retroactive to June 11) with a muscle strain in his left shoulder,
experienced no discomfort during yesterdayUs medical rehabilitation
start for Triple-A Oklahoma.  &QL; P &QR; Oliver, who did not figure in the
decision in the RedHawksU 6-5 loss to
Memphis, surrendered only two hits and one walk during five
scoreless innings. &LR; subheds:Van Poppel a go  &LR; hel9.6:Oates reiterated
yesterday right-hander Todd Van Poppel will start Thursday against
the Arizona Diamondbacks in Phoenix.  &QL; P &QR; One catch exists: Van
Poppel will be required to hit in the National League
ballpark.  &QL; P &QR; RI asked him today how much heUs been hitting lately,S
Oates said. RWeUll
give him a crash course when we get home.S &LR; subheds:No local TV
 &LR; hel9.6:Last nightUs game was the RangersU first regular-season
game not televised since Sept. 11, 1996, at Toronto. The 7 p.m.
start time interfered with ESPNUs exclusive telecast window that
affects road-game telecasts.  &LR; subheds:Briefly  &LR; hel9.6: &QL; f''Zapf
Dingbats'' &QR;  &QL; z9 &QR; n  &QL; f$ &QR;  &QL; z$ &QR; Right-hander Tanyon Sturtze, who
underwent arthroscopic surgery to repair a tear in his right
rotator cuff in February, made his first appearance this season
Saturday for the RangersU rookie affiliate in the Gulf Coast
League. Sturtze allowed three runs Q two earned Q on three hits,
including a home run, and two walks during two innings.  &QL; P &QR;  &QL; f''Zapf

HOME NETWORKING GETS BIG BOOST 
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN MARSHALL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
A coalition of leading high-tech companies is announcing support
today for technology that could slash the cost of wiring homes for
high-speed computer networks to less than $100 per computer.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The trick is to hook computers together over existing phone
wires so family members can surf the Web together, share printers
or shoot one another in computer game competitions.
</P>
<P>
   The Home Phoneline Networking Alliance enjoys support from such
giants as Advanced Micro Devices, AT&AMP;T, Compaq, Hewlett-Packard,
IBM and Intel Corp. It promises to get inexpensive home networking
technology into stores by the fourth quarter of 1998 _ in time for
holiday shopping sprees.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 15 million U.S. households already have two or more
PCs, but only a tiny fraction have networks to link them up. A
major deterrent is the complexity and mess of wiring up old houses
_ a job that can easily cost as much as a new computer if done by a
contractor.
</P>
<P>
   If the alliance has its way, consumers will be able to create an
instant network simply by plugging their computers into a phone
jack. They will need to install a special network card into their
computer or buy an inexpensive device that connects between a
parallel or USB port and a phone jack.
</P>
<P>
   Such devices are expected to cost under $100 per computer, said
Cyrus Namazi, a marketing manager at AMD in Sunnyvale and chairman
of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
   By next year, many computers will have chips on their
motherboard to make phone-line networks even simpler.
</P>
<P>
   The standard should ensure low prices for the equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``AMD, Lucent, 3Com, Intel and Rockwell are all competitors, but
we are trying to build the market'' through the alliance, Namazi
said. ``We are cooperating to proliferate this technology. As soon
as the market's big enough, we'll go cut each other's throats.''
</P>
<P>
   If the technology is truly ``plug 'n' play'' _ a key goal of the
alliance _ consumers should find plenty of applications for home
networks, Namazi said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a child upstairs working on homework and a mother
downstairs wanting to get access to her corporate network, they can
share Internet access,'' he said. ``You could put a network camera
near the crib to keep an eye on the baby or at the door to see
who's knocking.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gary Arlen of Arlen Communications in Bethesda, Md.,
questioned whether consumers would flock to embrace the technology.
``The whole idea of a home network is so geek-oriented that it's
very difficult to see this as a mass market anytime soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Rhinelander, an analyst with Forrester Research in
Cambridge, Mass., said he projected that more than 7 million U.S.
homes will have computer networks by the year 2002.
</P>
<P>
   But he said most applications proposed for such networks, such
as sharing files and printers or playing games, have little appeal
to consumers. ``The main driver for &LR;   &LR; this technology will be
sharing high-speed Internet access,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance is embracing technology devised by Tut Systems in
Pleasant Hill, a privately held company founded in 1991 by Martin
Graham and Matt Taylor, a professor and graduate student at the
University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Tut's ``HomeRun'' technology allows data to race across phone
wires at speeds up to 1 megabit per second, roughly 40 times faster
than a standard modem. Ordinary phone service isn't affected.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, Tut announced that it received $15 million in
new investments from three strategic partners: Microsoft Corp.,
Tokyo-based Itochu International, and AT&AMP;T Ventures. Microsoft
announced a marketing alliance with Tut last year.
</P>
<P>
   A Sunnyvale startup, Epigram, is working on phone networking
technology operating at 10 megabits per second, equal to the speed
of most common corporate networks. Epigram is a founder of the
alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Many other companies are pushing alternative home networking
strategies. Utah-based Intelogis Inc., for instance, sells devices
for under $100 that plug into electrical sockets in the wall and
send data over home power lines. But its network tops out at 350
kilobits per second and requires encryption to prevent neighbors
from picking up the signals on their power lines.
</P>
<P>
   In March, the Home Radio Frequency Working Group, which includes
some of the same players in today's announcement, said it would
promote wireless home networks, using radio links to connect
computers, printers and other devices.
</P>
<P>
   A Southern California startup, ShareWave, promises this fall to
make available this wireless equipment capable of multimegabit
speeds, but the cost is likely to be several hundred dollars per
computer. Its technology could be useful for reaching rooms with no
phone jacks or mobile computer users lounging by the pool.

 STEWART, LEHMAN CANUT STAY ON COURSE (For
use by NYTimes News Service clients) By JIMMY BURCH c.1998 Fort
Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; P &QR; SAN FRANCISCO Q The Olympic Club added to its U.S. Open
legacy yesterday
when another 54-hole leader stumbled down the stretch and lost the
tournament.  &QL; P &QR; For those counting at home, the course is now
four-for-four in producing
dramatic, comeback winners at the Open. The latest to fall, Payne
Stewart, added his name to a list that also includes Ben Hogan
(1955), Arnold Palmer (1966) and Tom Watson (1987). All were reeled
in at Olympic by players with fewer career victories on the PGA
Tour.  &QL; P &QR; RIUd say the golf course won. The golf course lived up to
its reputation,S
Stewart said after flushing a four-stroke lead in the final round
and losing by a stroke to Lee Janzen.  &QL; P &QR; Stewart joined Tom Lehman,
his final-round playing partner, as the two
sympathetic characters in the latest Olympic melodrama.  &QL; P &QR; Unable
to control his driver down the stretch, Stewart hit his fewest
number of fairways (six) and greens in regulation (nine) of any
round during Open week while ballooning to a 74. Lehman, a
sentimental favorite who was playing in the final group at the Open
for a fourth consecutive year, fell short once again in his Open
quest with a closing 75.  &QL; P &QR; RI said [Saturday] that if I played the
type of game Payne Stewart can
play, IUd be standing here with the trophy. And I didnUt do that,S
Stewart said. RPlus, Lee Janzen shot 68 on a day when nobody else
in contention could break par. He deserves to win.  &QL; P &QR; RIUm
disappointed. But this isnUt going to change my life. I didnUt play
well enough to win. ItUs as simple as that. And it wonUt take me
very long at all to get over this. IUll still be able to sleep
tonight.S  &QL; P &QR; Lehman indicated he may be missing a few winks for the
foreseeable future
because he was Rirritated with myselfS after falling short in the
Open for a fourth consecutive year. The failed 54-hole leader at
the past three Opens, Lehman began yesterdayUs final round four
strokes in back of Stewart and never made a birdie.  &QL; P &QR; He placed
fifth, which comes on the heels of finishes of third (1995),
second (1996) and third (1997).  &QL; P &QR; By his calculations, Lehman
never gave himself a decent birdie chance until
the 11th hole. Then, he failed to capitalize on three in a row.
 &QL; P &QR; RBy the time I made bogey on 14, I knew I was history,S Lehman
said. RFor
the last two days, IUve had the hardest time reading the greens. I
could never tell if we were going uphill or downhill. Therefore, I
never came close to making one.S  &QL; P &QR; Lehman left the course
displaying a unique mix of iron-willed determination
and heart-tugging frustration.  &QL; P &QR; RIf I can keep playing this well
in this tournament for the next four or
five years, I think IUm going to win one. Or two, or three or
four,S Lehman said. RBut the last thing I want to do right now is
play golf. This is a big tournament and IUm disappointed. IUm a
little bit irritated with myself. ItUs very frustrating to go
through this again, IUll be honest with you.S

WHEN SMOKING SNUFFS OUT YOUR JOB CHANCES 
</HEADLINE>
   By ILANA DEBARE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 Q:  I've been applying for office jobs in San Francisco and was
just rejected by two companies because I am a smoker. This wasn't
an issue of smoking in the office, which I know is taboo. At one
firm, the manager said she was a reformed smoker herself and could
not be comfortable in my presence. At the other, they said they
didn't want to hire me because I smell like cigarettes. I think
this is outrageous. Is it legal?
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; A number of states such as Colorado and New Hampshire have
laws prohibiting discrimination against people for lawful
activities such as smoking.
</P>
<P>
   But California isn't one _ so those two firms did have a right
to reject you for being a smoker.
</P>
<P>
   Companies have a lot of leeway in deciding whom to hire as long
as they don't discriminate on the basis of race, gender, religion,
age, sexual orientation or disability. Ideally, firms base their
hiring decisions on things like competence or credentials. But
other subjective factors often come into play, too _ from the
personal rapport that a candidate establishes with the boss to a
candidate's appearance or mannerisms.
</P>
<P>
   ``A company doesn't have to hire an applicant who smells bad, or
one who dresses poorly,'' said Chris Mead, an attorney with Cooper
Mead &AMP; Cooper in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly harder to be a smoker in the workplace today.
California law bans smoking in workplaces with five people or more.
Some places like North Miami, Fla., have even passed laws barring
smokers from working for city government, in an effort to improve
employees' health and cut insurance costs.
</P>
<P>
   But local smokers' rights activists say that cases like yours
are extremely rare in the Bay Area. ``I know many people who smoke,
and none had trouble getting a job,'' said Enoch Ludlow, treasurer
of a San Francisco group called FORCES, or Fight Ordinances and
Restrictions to Control and Eliminate Smoking.
</P>
<P>
   You should take a hard look at whether smoking was the real
reason you didn't get those jobs. Maybe something else in your
attitude or background turned the companies off, and they were
using smoking as an excuse.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe you really do need to deal with an odor problem because
of your smoking.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone tells you they're rejecting you because you smell
bad, that should be a lesson,'' Mead said. ``I would definitely
clean up my act and wear some cologne to my next interview.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; My company recently adopted a new rule saying that if you
take time off, it must be a minimum of four hours. There are times
when I need just one or two hours off for personal business, but
they say I must take a full four hours. They say this new system is
easier for the timekeeper. Don't we as employees have a right to
take off small amounts of time?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Companies must pay their workers for all the time they
actually put in. So if you took two hours off and the company
docked your pay as if you'd taken four hours off, that would be
illegal. You could file a complaint with the California Labor
Commissioner, at (415) 557-7878.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't sound like the case here. The company is
docking you four hours' pay, but it's also telling you to take off
the full four hours. So you don't have a legal claim for unpaid
wages.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do you have any legal right to take off an hour here or
there for personal business.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no law imposing a requirement that people get small
amounts of time off,'' said Angela Bradstreet, an attorney with
Carroll Burdick &AMP; McDonough in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Just because a policy is legal, though, doesn't make it wise.
</P>
<P>
   Requiring workers to take time off in four-hour blocks may be
necessary in a factory setting, Bradstreet said, if replacement
workers must be hired by the half-day or full-day.
</P>
<P>
   But otherwise, a policy like this actually might end up hurting
the company _ by keeping workers off the job for more time than
necessary, and by undermining the morale of employees who feel that
they're being unfairly treated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd advise the company to think very carefully about whether
this achieves the goals they want,'' Bradstreet said. ``It may be
more disruptive than useful.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; I was hospitalized because of complications with a
pregnancy in 1990. At the time, my employer told me that I didn't
qualify for any kind of disability benefits and that my only choice
was to resign. I followed his advice and submitted my resignation
letter. Now I've learned that not only should I have received
disability, but I also should have been rehired after my illness. I
lost almost $10,000 because of this. Do I have any recourse?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Back in 1990, the state and federal laws requiring
companies to give their employees 12 weeks off for serious illness
weren't yet in effect.
</P>
<P>
   But California did have a pregnancy disability law requiring
companies with five or more employees to provide four months of
unpaid leave to employees who are disabled by pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   If you'd known about that law, you could have taken unpaid time
off to recover from your hospitalization without losing your job.
You also could have applied for state disability insurance, which
would have paid part of your salary while you were off work.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, so much time has passed that now it's too late to
try and recover damages from your employer for misinforming you
about your rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, the pregnancy disability law gives you one year to
file a complaint with the Fair Employment and Housing Agency,''
said Doris Ng, a staff attorney with Equal Rights Advocates, a San
Francisco public interest law firm that focuses on issues of
women's equality. ``Since this happened in 1990, it's probably too
late to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The lesson here? If you think you've been denied family or
medical leave illegally, talk to a lawyer or file a complaint
without delay.
</P>
<P>
   Equal Rights Advocates offers free advice and counseling on
women's employment issues, at (800) 839-4372. So does the Women's
Employment Rights law clinic of Golden Gate University, at (415)
442-6647. And the Employment Law Center offers free legal advice to
both male and female low-income workers at (415) 864-8208.

KNIFE ATTACK ON FAMILY LEAVES 1 DEAD AND 2 HURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Detectives are searching for a 25-year-old man
accused of stabbing his former girlfriend in her family's home in
Middle Village, Queens, Sunday morning and then turning the knife
on the woman's parents, killing her mother, when they tried to
rescue her.
</P>
<P>
   When the bloody attack was over, Kathleen Grech, 55, lay dead;
her daughter, Heather, 20, had been critically injured, and Mrs.
Grech's husband, Tristan, 54, had been seriously injured, the
police said.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Inspector Martin Johnson of Queens detectives said police
were searching for Heather Grech's former boyfriend, Robert
Parsell, who they believe committed the crime after his attempt to
reconcile with Ms. Grech failed.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives said that Parsell, a milk truck driver, apparently
was upset after Ms. Grech left him last week and moved, with their
1{-year-old son, back to her parents' home at 69-26 61st Rd.,
police said. He grew desperate Saturday, they said, when he heard
that she had been seen with another man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our understanding is that he became aware of her admirer
earlier in the evening and that he asked her dad to intercede on
his behalf so that they could talk out their troubles,'' Johnson
said. ``They were sitting in the living room discussing the problem
when the violence broke out.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack began just before 7 a.m., police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a violent argument, and he pulled a knife from his
clothes and stabbed Heather,'' Johnson said. ``Her mother and
father rushed to her aid and he stabbed them.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point Ms. Grech's older brother, David, awoke to the
sound of screams, ran downstairs and chased Parsell out of the
house, police said.
</P>
<P>
   As Parsell attacked Miss Grech and her family, their son,
Robbie, sat in his highchair in the next room, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The brutal crime stunned neighbors in Middle Village, a quiet
community of two-family homes. Anne Russo, 35, said she was walking
home from a diner with her boyfriend when she saw Tristan Grech run
out of his house, bleeding from his arms and shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was screaming, `Somebody help my wife! Help my wife!''' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Ms. Russo said, she saw David Grech run out of the house.
``The son asked me to take the baby,'' she said. ``He was in a
panic. He said, `I have to take care of my mother and sister.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Russo said that she ran into the house and pulled Robbie,
who was crying, from his highchair in the kitchen. ``There was a
lot of blood,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said Kathleen Grech worked as a bookkeeper in
Manhattan and that her husband worked as a limousine driver. They
worshiped regularly at Our Lady of Hope Roman Catholic Church. On
Sunday, a priest from the church went to the house to administer
last rites to Mrs. Grech.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Grech and Robert Parsell had been dating since she was a
student at the Mary Louis Academy, neighbors said. Police said Ms.
Grech had tried to leave him before, but they added that they had
never received reports of domestic violence.
</P>
<P>
   For the last two months they lived in a three-bedroom apartment
on the second floor of a house at 64-30 65th Place. Neighbors there
said they disliked Parsell, whom they described as antisocial, but
added that they were surprised to hear he was wanted for murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't like him,'' said one, Julianne Cassidy. ``Something
about his eyes. I would hear him yell at the child often.''
</P>
<P>
   Parsell has been arrested twice before, on charges of assault
and car theft, police said.

RESTORATION HARDWARE MAY BE TONIC FOR IPO MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK VEVERKA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Trite but true. Can you say flight to quality?
<TEXT>
<P>
   Because of its strong store sales and easy-to-understand
business, Restoration Hardware may have single-handedly restored a
modicum of faith in the withering initial offering market.
</P>
<P>
   The IPO for the Corte Madera-based home furnishings retailer
sprang out of the box Friday with a vengeance. After pricing shares
at $19 _ a dollar higher than anticipated by underwriters _
Restoration closed its first day of trading at an impressive $26.25
a share.
</P>
<P>
   And while a 38 percent rise on the first day of trading is
outstanding by almost any measure, the jump is particularly
impressive since it arrives amid a moribund IPO climate.
</P>
<P>
   The IPO Monitor, a Los Angeles-area firm that tracks initial
offerings, rates the current market for IPOs as ``relatively
poor.'' The firm's IPO-30 index stood at 3.55 last week, meaning
the average price for the 30 most recent IPOs has risen only 3.55
percent since that basket of stocks went public.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Restoration's stellar performance didn't catch many
retail observers off guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not surprised at all. I think investors realize that it's
a niche business with a lot of opportunities to sell merchandise,''
says retail real estate executive Kathy Huber, president of
Location-net, a real estate information firm in Corte Madera.
</P>
<P>
   So what is so compelling about Restoration Hardware?
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, it's not really a hardware store at all. While it
started in Eureka 18 years ago as a seller of decorative doorknobs
and hard-to-find drawer handles for folks refurbishing old homes,
the company _ now with 44 stores in 21 states _ has evolved into an
innovative merchant of stylish home furnishings that don't
necessarily cost an arm and a leg.
</P>
<P>
   In the company's words: ``The stores' architectural style create
a unique and attractive selling environment designed to appeal to
an affluent, well-educated customer'' between the ages of 35 to 55.
</P>
<P>
   Can you say aging Baby Boomer?
</P>
<P>
   You can bet that mall developers and landlords can. They are in
lust with the retailer and its customers' wallets. In fact, both
mall and strip center developers are interested in bringing
Restoration to their projects, which gives the merchant a bundle of
opportunities to open new stores in some of the choicest spots in
the &LR;   &LR; country. Many retailers are typecast as suitable only for
regional malls or just strip centers, but seldom both, retail
analysts say. But Restoration busts through that barrier,
essentially allowing the company to double its options for choosing
locations.
</P>
<P>
   And because adding more stores is critical to the performance of
most retail stocks, prime real estate locations can drive a
company's sales and profits.
</P>
<P>
   Why are mall owners and developers so smitten with Restoration?
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, the amount of rent paid by retailers is linked to
their sales performance. And in recent years, the registers have
been ringing big-time at Restoration's stores. Check out these
numbers:
</P>
<P>
   For the fiscal year ended January 31, Restoration's average
sales per square foot of selling space were $583. In comparison,
stores in the top malls in the country report sales of $400 to $450
per square foot, says Location-net's Huber.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Restoration recorded sales of $97.9 million and
operating profits of $3.2 million. And the all-important same-store
sales figures have risen an average of 19 percent annually during
the past two fiscal years.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Restoration plans to open 25 new stores by the end
of this fiscal year and another 30 stores in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;   &LR; But there is some potential danger. While aggressive growth
is good in the eyes of fund managers, especially during a booming
economy, it also presents risk. Restoration doesn't have a long
track record showing that it can roll out new stores at such a
rapid clip. Cloning the culture of the stores is essential for
successful expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Branding is also important, and at least one retail expert
wonders if the name ``Restoration Hardware'' no longer represents
what the retailer is all about. After all, only 17 percent of its
merchandise is actually hardware.
</P>
<P>
   ``The name itself is quite a misnomer. While we would be
hard-pressed to find a name that is better suited to describe the
wonderful hodgepodge of merchandise, we worry that this one might
send customers off-track,'' says retail consultant Neil Stern of
McMillan/ Doolittle in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he admits, `` I guess Crate and Barrel didn't really mean
anything at first either.''

   KOSOVO-REBELS (Junik, Serbia) _ War has a choreography that only
its participants understand. Fighters, locked in an embrace, feel
out the daily beat and rhythm until the set is shattered by a surge
of anarchic violence. Such a dance is underway in Kosovo, where
armed peasant farmers, joined by hundreds of rebels that have
picked up weapons and uniforms over the border in northern Albania,
face down some 50,000 government soldiers and special police. By

   CHINA-CLINTON-ASSESS _ As Clinton prepares for his summit in

   CENTENARIANS (Phoenix) _ Centenarians aren't what they used to
be. There are so many _ between 30,000 and 50,000, according to
demographers, up from the 1980 estimate of 15,000 _ that it's hard
to get a televised 100th birthday greeting from Willard Scott, who
mentions 12 every week on the Today Show. Every week about 90 new
centenarians are disappointed. Centenarians are the country's
fastest growing age group, with projections that by the middle of
the next century more than 600,000 Americans will be over 100. By

   CLINTON-STARR _ Five months after investigators began exploring
allegations of a relationship between Clinton and Monica Lewinsky,
the former White House intern's new lawyers appear to have returned
to the same standoff with Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel,
that her previous lawyers confronted. Details of the negotiations
between Starr and Ms. Lewinsky's legal team, which appeared Sunday
in the Washington Post and were confirmed by people with knowledge

   TIME-CNN-MEDIA (Undated) _ Doubts about the accuracy of a recent

FOR LEHMAN, THE CIRCLE REMAINS INCOMPLETE
</HEADLINE>
   (See also GLF-USOPEN, GLF-USOPEN-NOTEBOOK) 
(ja) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Tom Lehman had hoped, finally, to close the
circle that had opened here at Olympic in the 1987 U.S. Open. But
he didn't.
</P>
<P>
   As Lee Janzen won the 98th Open Sunday, Lehman again emerged as
a sympathetic figure. He is now golf's version of the Buffalo
Bills, the team that lost four straight Super Bowls. Not that he
should be considered a loser. He won the 1996 British Open. But
four times in the last four years, he has been in the hunt going
into the last round of the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   In the last pairing with Payne Stewart Sunday, Lehman teed off
four shots behind. But he soared to a 75, tying for fifth after
finishing third, second and third the previous years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't lose it, I didn't win it; I wasn't four ahead,''
Lehman said later, alluding to Stewart's lead after 54 holes. ``A
solid round could've been a big victory for me.''
</P>
<P>
   By then Lehman realized that another 68 (which he shot in the
first and third rounds) would have edged Janzen's par 280 for the
trophy.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman was just about everybody's sentimental choice coming into
this tournament at the Olympic Club, where his Open career began 11
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody in golf knew him then. He was an assistant pro at Wood
Ranch near Los Angeles, after having earned a total of only $39,000
in three years on the PGA Tour. After qualifying for the Open, he
arrived at Olympic with Melissa, now his wife, along with his
brother Mike and his caddie, Buck Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all piled into one motel room near the airport so we didn't
have to spend the extra money,'' Lehman said.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't make the cut. The next year, the Lehmans took their
last $8,000 out of the bank to go to South Africa, where he
finished third in that nation's Open, a $20,000 payday. In 1990 he
joined the Hogan (now Nike) Tour, winning four times and emerging
as its leading money winner to qualify for the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the quiet, modest Lehman has earned more than $5
million in prize money. He also has endorsement contracts that
guarantee him at least $5 million a year for the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   But for many golfers, the Open circle can be the most difficult
to close, because the Open is arguably the most difficult of the
four majors. The rough is too thick, the greens too fast.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Snead never did win the Open, blowing to an 8 on the final
hole at the Spring Mill course of the Philadelphia Country Club in
1939 when all he needed was a par 5. Arnold Palmer streaked to a
final-round 65 to win at Cherry Hills in Denver in 1960, then lost
three 18-hole playoffs. Tom Watson holed a memorable chip-in to win
at Pebble Beach in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Bobby Jones, Ben Hogan and Jack Nicklaus share
the Open record with four victories (along with Willie Anderson
nearly a century ago). Proof that Jones, Hogan and Nicklaus were
the best of their respective eras.
</P>
<P>
   But no other recent golfer has had the elusive opportunity to
win the world's most prestigious championship more often than this
big man from Minnesota who now lives in Scottsdale, Ariz., with
Melissa and their three children.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're in for a big fight,'' Lehman said of the Open on
Saturday night, when he was only four strokes behind Stewart, then
the leader. ``If you don't feel like you're up to four days of
never giving up, it can deflate you before you even start.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past three Opens, he had been paired with Jeff Maggert
last year at Congressional, with Steve Jones at Oakland Hills and
with Greg Norman at Shinnecock Hills.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman thought he had hit a 3-iron ``just perfect'' last year
before the ball splashed into the pond next to the 17th green as
Ernie Els won. Two years ago he pushed his driver on the 18th tee
into a fairway bunker and took a bogey as Jones won with a par.
Three years ago he soared to a 74 as Corey Pavin won.
</P>
<P>
   Some golfers would be tormented by being so close at the Open
and yet so far. Not Lehman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think torment is a bad word,'' he said early in the week.
``I have never been tormented by it, ever. There are good memories.
There is not many people who have a chance to play in the last
group at a U.S. Open, much less three years in a row. And there is
not many guys that go to the 72nd hole with a chance to win ever,
much less two years in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   But now Tom Lehman, who will turn 40 next March, must wait for
next year's Open at Pinehurst, N.C., which he is already thinking
about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll get it right,'' he said.

MORE DIGITS NEEDED TO DIAL FOR DOLLARS 
</HEADLINE>
   By AMY DOAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Starting July 1, you'll have to dial seven digits instead of five
to bypass your regular phone carrier to hook up with alternative
providers like Telecom USA's ``10321'' that claim to offer lower
rates. Because of the dramatic growth in this industry, the Federal
Communications Commission is expanding the supply of identification
codes by 9,000 with the intent of keeping the ``10'' prefix
consistent. Under the new system, you must add ``10'' to an
existing carrier's identification code. For example, 10321 becomes
1010321.

   RETIREMENT PLANS: Most Americans rely on employers rather than
themselves or Social Security to finance retirement, a new survey
shows. The study, conducted by the nonprofit Certified Financial
Planner Board of Standards, suggests that 67 percent of Americans
depend heavily on employers to fund their golden years, compared
with 10 percent who depend mostly on personal retirement plans and
3 percent who rely on Social Security. The survey, which also lists
the top reasons Americans don't achieve their retirement goals, is

KEEP THE POINTS, MAYFIELD HAS A VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Ky.)   (bl)  
 By TARIK EL-BASHIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONG POND, Pa. _ For almost a month now, Jeremy Mayfield has
been atop the NASCAR world, holding on to a small lead in the
Winston Cup point standing by consistently finishing near the
front.
</P>
<P>
   Still, something was missing. Mayfield was in first place, but
he had made it there without a trip to victory lane this season. In
fact, he had not won a race in four years, 125 starts, on NASCAR's
top circuit.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday, in a messy, drawn-out, rain-delayed Pocono 500,
Mayfield finally justified his reign by holding off Jeff Gordon's
late charge, claiming his first career victory. Gordon was second,
seconds behind, and Dale Jarrett finished third.
</P>
<P>
   It was an emotional scene on victory lane as Mayfield climbed
from his Ford Taurus. He hugged and kissed his wife, then got
mobbed by a jubilant group from his Mobil 1 team, which also got
its first victory.
</P>
<P>
   For race car drivers, there are few things in life sweeter than
their first triumph. And those emotions were not lost on Mayfield,
who got a little choked up after the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``By far this is the best thing that's ever happened to me,''
said Mayfield, 29, from Owensboro, Ky. ``To come in here and win at
Pocono and get my first Winston Cup win was more of a relief than
anything I've ever experienced. It's a dream come true for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield, who extended his lead over the second-place Gordon to
36 points, added: ``This was the biggest thing we needed to go
after the championship. You have to win a race before you can win
the championship. We know what it takes to win now. Hopefully we
can get several more before the end of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield, who led for 122 of the 200 laps around the 2.5-mile
tri-oval, took the lead for good on Lap 179, passing Darrell
Waltrip with a brilliantly executed restart after the race's eighth
yellow flag. Moments later, Gordon passed Waltrip and began his
assault on Mayfield.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, the pole-sitter, track record-holder and two-time
defending champion who was favored to win Sunday, drove his
Chevrolet Monte Carlo to within a car-length of Mayfield with four
laps to go. All Gordon needed was for Mayfield to miss a shift,
take a wrong line on the track, or lose concentration for a moment.
But Mayfield maintained the composure he has become known for, and
Gordon's car lacked the horsepower to mount a serious charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeremy deserves it,'' Gordon said. ``He's been so close this
year. He ran a heck of a race today. We had something for him in
the corners, but he was so strong down the straightaways. He had
some great power.''
</P>
<P>
   The race was slowed by nine cautions, and was delayed by almost
an hour and a half because of showers. Mayfield's average speed was
117.801 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Rusty Wallace's hard luck at Pocono continued as he was
black-flagged for a false start, then blew an engine a few laps
later. Wallace, who started second behind Gordon, illegally passed
him en route to the opening green flag. Then, on Lap 14, Wallace's
engine failed after he pushed his car to the limit to make up lost
ground. He finished 42nd, dropping from fifth to sixth place in the
Winston Cup points race, 216 points behind Mayfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just took off and he took off, and I was going faster,''
said Wallace, who was also penalized for passing the pole-sitter
prematurely at Martinsville last season. ``I guess I had more
power. I should have throttled back and let him get in front of me,
then get back on the gas pedal again.''
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that Gordon, who was forced into a concrete barrier
by Wallace three weeks ago at Richmond, realized Wallace had sped
ahead of him and did not fully accelerate at the start. If that was
the case, consider the score settled.

CITY TEACHING QUIETLY IN RELIGIOUS SCHOOLS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JACQUES STEINBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A year after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that public
school teachers in New York City could hold remedial and other
supplementary classes inside religious schools, rather than in
oversize vans off the school grounds, school and union officials
say there have been no complaints from those teachers.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem has involved classroom space: Because some
parochial schools did not have room for the additional classes, a
third have retained some of the vans, which are leased by the Board
of Education, and are expected to do so again next school year. The
price tag, estimated at $5.1 million in the school year ending this
month, is being paid by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   For most of the more than 150 religious schools in New York City
that receive the teachers' services, the constitutional lines
between church and state have blurred a bit this year, albeit
subtly. On Friday, for example, Bernadine DeCarlo, a social worker
employed by the Board of Education, weaved through the hallways of
St. Luke's School in the Mott Haven section of the Bronx, past
crucifixes and statues of the Virgin Mary.
</P>
<P>
   Though by law, the nurse's office where she counsels students
has to be free of iconography, she concedes that it is impossible
to miss the images of Roman Catholicism on her job. And, she
stresses, it doesn't bother her. ``Here, children have a lot of
family problems, problems with gangs in the neighborhoods, problems
being raised without one parent or both,'' she said. ``These are
the important issues. Religion doesn't really come up.''
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, public schools must provide special services
_ like tutoring in English as a second language or special
counseling _ to all students who qualify, whether in public,
parochial or other private schools. From 1965, when the Elementary
and Secondary Education Act was passed, until 1985, those services
were typically provided in parochial classrooms by public school
teachers, who took their assignments voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1985, the Supreme Court found that the coexistence and
monitoring of secular and religious activities within the religious
school buildings had led to an unconstitutional entanglement of
church and state. The court ruled that the teachers could not hold
classes inside religious schools. In response, the idea of teaching
in vans was conceived.
</P>
<P>
   Last June, the court effectively reversed its 1985 ruling.
Writing for the majority in a 5-4 decision, Justice Sandra Day
O'Connor said the court had abandoned its view that placing public
employees on parochial school grounds ``inevitably results'' in a
violation of the constitutionally mandated separation of church and
state.
</P>
<P>
   During the 12 years between the decisions, New York City spent
$100 million in federal education aid to lease the ubiquitous red,
white and blue vans, each 40 by 8 feet, that were parked outside
Catholic, Jewish, Lutheran and other religious schools, their
generators always humming.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At St. Luke's, a brown-brick building with 363 pupils in
prekindergarten through eighth grade, the principal, Sister Pat
Howell, was able to partition an upstairs classroom with file
cabinets to make room this year for the classes in English as a
second language and remedial reading.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Saycon, who had taught English as a second language outside
in the vans for two years, said she was thrilled to be inside.
``It's more conducive to learning,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, until more space is renovated, Lee Fettner
continues to teach as many as 10 remedial-math students at a time
in a van that is little bigger than a motor home and sits outside
the school's 139th Street exit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only time religion comes up is when the priest wishes me a
happy Passover and I wish him a happy Easter,'' said Fettner, who
is Jewish. ``We all get along very well.''

MUTUAL FUNDS WOOING JAPANESE INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By GREG CHANG  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
TOKYO -- Keiko Iizuka is a tough and smart reporter who covers
politics for one of Japan's leading daily newspapers. Yet despite
her savvy, the 34-year-old single woman finds the prospect of
investing for retirement daunting.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I am not managing my money at all. It seems to me that you
need so much information to invest and make money,'' said Iizuka.
``I would like to invest but I'm too busy and I just find it a
little overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   Like most Japanese, Iizuka doesn't buy stocks or mutual funds.
Instead, she has socked away her savings of about $40,000 in two
bank accounts that pay less than 1 percent interest annually _
almost the equivalent of sticking the money under the mattress.
</P>
<P>
   Iizuka's financial profile makes her a prime target for foreign
mutual fund companies like Fidelity Investments and Merrill Lynch &AMP;
Co., which have begun to earnestly court Japanese consumers in the
midst of a series of government reforms known collectively as the
``Big Bang.'' They are designed to allow more competition by
liberalizing foreign exchange rules, trading commissions and other
barriers.
</P>
<P>
   New foreign companies seem to join the fray daily, with the
latest link up being Travelers Group Inc.'s proposal to buy 25
percent of brokerage firm Nikko Securities Co. Banks are scheduled
to start selling funds by year-end, and Fidelity and others already
sell their funds from rented spaces inside individual Tokyo
branches of prominent banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a perfect time to enter the Japanese market. We're all
starting from the same line,'' said Bill Wilder, president of
Fidelity Investments Japan. ``Interest rates are low and there's a
rapidly aging population.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to envision that for forever and a day Japanese
people are not going to buy stocks. You've got just too much in
personal assets that are collecting nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   The pot of gold for Fidelity and the others is the more than $9
trillion in personal assets owned by Japanese individuals, the
largest reservoir of wealth in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of a nine-year bear market, Japanese have placed
nearly 60 percent of that massive nest egg is in low-yielding
savings and post office accounts, and invested less than 10 percent
in stocks or mutual funds, known locally as investment trusts. Now,
as banks and a major brokerage have gone bankrupt, Japanese are so
concerned about protecting their money that they are buying home
safes at a record pace.
</P>
<P>
   The mutual fund companies hope to attract risk-averse Japanese
investors by exploiting fears of a collapsing retirement system.
They are betting that by 1999 Japanese will gain direct control of
their retirement funds through the adoption a tax-sheltered scheme
similar to the 401(k) plan that has spurred the meteoric rise of
personal investment in America by making it easy to buy mutual
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Fears about retirement reflect changes in Japanese society
brought about by prolonged economic stagnation.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese employees have traditionally accepted long working
hours because they believed the company would take care of them for
life. Now a sluggish economy and miserable stock market are leading
to questions about the sustainability of such an arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have only about 50 percent trust in the current system. I
really wonder if I will ever get anything back when I am older,''
said Yukiko Satoh, a 32-year-old stylist with a television network
who contributes more than $200 a month to her company's pension
plan.
</P>
<P>
   While the potential rewards for addressing such concerns are
vast, the foreign mutual fund companies will have to flex all of
their marketing muscles to convince Japanese consumers to make
mutual funds a way of life.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese reluctance to gamble money on stocks is intensified
by a market that has lost an average of 6 percent annually since
1989. The Nikkei index of 225 stocks has plunged from a peak of
almost 39,000 to less than 15,600.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before 1990, when the Japanese economy was booming, anybody
could get rich with stocks,'' said Yoshitaka Akiba, president of a
Tokyo investment adviser firm. ``Even as the market began
declining, bargain hunters were still putting in money. Now in
1998, people continue to lose money, so they are giving up.''
</P>
<P>
   Japan has also yet to be exposed to the kind of hype that has
added to the American vocabulary terms such as asset allocation,
long-term investing and risk assesment. Funds in Japan were
previously available only through brokerages, which tried to boost
commissions by encouraging frequent buying and selling.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the foreign securities companies seem relatively credible
in a country that has been shaken by financial scandals and the
collapse of financial institutions. Fidelity is promoting its funds
in a series of full-page newspaper ads that portray the company as
a fresh place to start in a new investment era.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity says the response has exceeded expectations. The
company on April 1 began its direct marketing efforts with a
toll-free phone number that more than 3,000 people used in the
first week alone.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese securities houses and banks are fighting back by
playing on resentment reminiscent of that encountered by Japanese
companies that invested heavily in America in the mid-1980s. Nomura
Securities Co. and Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd. make a point of
describing their new partnership as ``a Japanese alliance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I constantly have to tell people that we are not here to take
over Japan,'' said Teri Kilduff, a Fidelity spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   To discourage such suspicion, some of the foreign companies are
treating Japan as a long term investment.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity has purchased land in Tochigi Prefecture, a three hour
train ride from Tokyo, for future expansion. Merrill paid up to
$300 million for 33 retail brokerage outlets formally owned by the
defunct Yamaichi Securities, and hired some 2,000 of the firm's
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Such a strategy may be appropriate, as the companies are laying
the foundation for takeoff when the Japanese markets revive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will probably take several years for the foreign companies
to gain the trust of Japanese people,'' said Seiichi Toshida,
president of the Japan Center for Economic Research. ``It is not
easy to change people's attitudes, though it can be done.''

GAY MEN WHO ADOPTED 3-YEAR-OLD PARTICIPATE IN SYMBOLIC WEDDING
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FAIR LAWN, N.J. _ In an Episcopal church ceremony symbolically
set on Father's Day, two gay men whose lawsuit paved the way for
other unmarried couples in the state to adopt children jointly were
united Sunday in a ``holy union'' as friends, relatives and
television cameras looked on.
</P>
<P>
   While it lacked the legal status of a marriage ceremony, the
event nevertheless marked another passage for the two men, Jon
Holden-Galluccio, 34, and Michael Galluccio, 36, of Maywood. In the
course of their successful two-year effort to adopt a child
jointly, they have emerged from the anonymity in which many gay
couples feel compelled to live. And in the process, Galluccio said,
they have become very public symbols to gay men and lesbians about
the ``possibility of a whole new world opening up for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as relatives of the two men winced at how public the
couple's private lives had become, they agreed with Adolph
Galluccio, Michael's father, who said that the attention was
worthwhile if it helped other families to avoid alienation from
their gay children.
</P>
<P>
   But just how public the couple's lives and story have become was
only hinted at in Sunday's ceremony. The rites drew 120 people to
the small Church of the Atonement, where the two men have been
members for the last three years. A block away, the sole protester
stood with a sign saying, ``There are no gays in Heaven _ repent.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way to adopting their son, Adam, who is now 3 years
old, they became accidental advocates with a monthly newsletter
sent to 500 subscribers, a World Wide Web page
(www.gaynj.net/galluccio/) and an agent who has booked speaking
engagements around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``They make a good impression,'' said Michael Hickman, the
organizer of the ninth annual South Carolina Gay and Lesbian Pride
March and Festival. The two men and a squirming Adam were guests at
the festival last month in Myrtle Beach. ``The mayor of the town
said that they didn't want us in a town where traditional family
values ruled,'' Hickman said. ``So we wanted to show that family
values weren't just for traditional families.''
</P>
<P>
   This tableau has generated heated responses from groups like the
conservative Christian Family Research Council, whose members have
monitored the couple's activities. ``That young boy has been
paraded around like a trophy at gay pride events,'' said Bob
Knight, the group's director of cultural studies. ``And now these
two homosexual men seek further publicity to advance a homosexual
activist agenda. There is nothing holy about this union, and it is
a mockery of marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   Neary three years ago, the two men became the foster parents of
Adam. When they tried to adopt the boy formally, New Jersey child
welfare officials assented, as long as they did it separately in
two distinct and costly legal procedures. Under New Jersey law,
same-sex couples and unmarried heterosexual couples had no legal
standing that would allow them to adopt jointly.
</P>
<P>
   The couple challenged the law in court. Last October, Judge
Sybil Moses of Superior Court in Bergen County granted the joint
adoption, saying it was in the best interest of the child. Two
months later, all legal barriers to joint adoption by unmarried
same-sex and heterosexual couples were removed in a broader consent
decree. New Jersey became the first state to establish a policy
treating gay and unmarried couples the same way it treats married
couples regarding adoptions.
</P>
<P>
   Only two states _ New Hampshire and Florida _ specifically bar
adoptions by gay couples. The recognition of Holden and Galluccio
as a family was seen by many as a step toward greater recognition
of gay unions.
</P>
<P>
   After the consent decree in December, the calls began flooding
in, Galluccio and Holden-Galluccio said in an interview before
Sunday's ceremony. There were tearfully whispered encouragements
from frightened and closeted gay men and plaudits from gay high
school and college students who called the men heroes. The couple
said they started feeling responsible for people and stayed in the
public eye.
</P>
<P>
   Holden-Galluccio said that the couple had been trying hard to
hold on to the spiritual and personal significance of Sunday's
ceremony amid the notoriety that had seized their lives. But the
personal and the spiritual kept intersecting with the public and
the political. The two men draped yellow-flowered leis around their
necks and those of the clergymen and women and family members. The
leis were gifts from Joe Melillo and Pat Lagon, two gay men in
Hawaii who have sued for the right to a legally recognized
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Take pictures if you can,'' the card accompanying the leis
read. ``We'd love to add them to our growing scrapbook of the
journey to equal rights for all.''

NOTEBOOK: MONTGOMERIEHAS ANOTHER UNPLEASANT EXCHANGE
</HEADLINE>
  (See also GLF-USOPEN and GLF-ANDERSON-COLUMN)  
(ja) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It was a disappointing tournament for Colin
Montgomerie, who was heckled by fans throughout the week.
Montgomerie finished at 11 over par, though he did shoot 69 Sunday.
However, Montgomerie had another unpleasant exchange with a fan
during Sunday's round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I seem to be blamed for winning the Ryder Cup, but I had 11
strong individuals with me as well,'' said Montgomerie, who helped
Europe defeat the United States last September in Spain. ``It's
always the minority that are more vocal than the majority,
unfortunately.''
</P>
<P>
   Montgomerie insisted that this week's problems would not kill
his love for the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always said I really enjoy this tournament, and I always
will,'' Montgomerie said. ``It's a real mental battle. You get
rewarded for good shots, and you definitely get penalized for bad
ones. I'm a great fan of that and always will be.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Montgomerie started to play well Sunday morning, he
was already out of contention. So his quest to win a major
continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very difficult week,'' Montgomerie said. ``I found
out what I was doing wrong on the practice tee this morning, which
is a bit late. My alignment was wrong. Now I'll look forward to the
British Open.''
</P>
<P>
   A Course Favorite
</P>
<P>
   Paul Azinger's 65 Sunday was the best round of the tournament.
He was able to take advantage of an early-morning tee time. Though
he did not contend, Azinger said he hopes the U.S. Open returns to
the Olympic Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the United States Golf Association were ever to go to a
four or five-course rotation, you would like to see this on the
rotation,'' Azinger said. ``Maybe this, Pebble Beach, Shinnecock
and Winged Foot. I think all the players, for the most part, really
like this course.''
</P>
<P>
   His Best Birthday
</P>
<P>
   Matt Kuchar, the 1997 U.S. Amateur champion, shot a 74 Sunday
and finished tied for 14th. At 9 over par, he was the best among
the amateurs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the hardest course I've ever seen,'' said Kuchar, who
celebrated his 20th birthday Sunday. ``I wanted to see how high I
could finish. I wanted to see my name on the leader board. This has
been a good birthday, a lot of fun. It's the most memorable one
I've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods Not Discouraged
</P>
<P>
   Casey Martin (11 over), the first player to compete in the U.S.
Open using a cart, finished tied for 23rd _ and second in driving
distance (291.3), to John Daly (295.6). Tiger Woods finished tied
for 18th at 10 over par. Woods will continue to hear criticism that
his game is not made for Open courses, but he was not discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``The putter wasn't there this week,'' Woods said. ``I didn't
play that well. But I hung in there on the course that was very
difficult.'
</P>
<P>
   Putts Fail Price Again
</P>
<P>
   Nick Price made a strong bid to win his fourth major
championship, but settled for fourth place after shooting a 73
Sunday, to finish 5 over par for the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just couldn't make any putts,'' Price said. ``It has been
like that for four months. But I feel confident that I'm not that
far away. If I start making them, I can get on a streak like I was
in '93 and '94. I had a lot of birdie opportunities, but when
you're missing putts, it puts you on the defensive, and it's hard
to make up ground. But all and all it was a good week, very
encouraging. I'm looking forward to the rest of the year.''

NYC SCHOOLS CHIEF SEEKS 2 MORE YEARS ON CONTRACT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Seeking to break the city school system's recent
pattern of 11 leaders in 15 years, Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew
will soon ask the Board of Education to consider a two-year
extension to his contract, which is due to expire in July 1999.
</P>
<P>
   If the board agrees, which is considered likely, Crew's tenure
would be three months shy of six years. That would make him the
longest-serving chancellor in the 28-year history of the position
and the longest-serving chief schools executive _ the position was
known as superintendent before 1970 _ since William Jansen, who led
the schools for 11 years, from 1947 to 1958.
</P>
<P>
   Crew said Friday that he had ruled out staying beyond six years,
a milestone he would reach in October 2001, because he did not
intend to work with a mayor other than Rudolph Giuliani. Giuliani
is barred by law from seeking a third term in the next mayoral
election, in November 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think after that period of time, a new mayor comes in and is
going to want to work with his or her own chancellor,'' said Crew,
who has enjoyed a close political alliance, and the occasional
after-hours cigar, with Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   By law, it is the independent, seven-member board, and not the
mayor, that selects the chancellor. But although the mayor appoints
only two board members, mayors, because they approve the board's
budget, have always had a central role in filling the chancellor's
job.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Friday, Giuliani said he would urge the board to
``keep the chancellor for as long as we can.'' Crew, whose annual
salary of $195,000 has remained constant since he was appointed in
October 1995, said he expected to seek a raise in coming
negotiations with the board.
</P>
<P>
   In the tumultuous search to replace Chancellor Ramon Cortines
after he announced his resignation in June 1995, Crew emerged as a
compromise choice only after the board majority and Giuliani had
eliminated each other's leading candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Board president William Thompson, a vocal supporter of Crew, did
not return calls to his home and office Friday. The four-year terms
of Thompson and the other six board members expire June 30. But he
and four other board members are expected to be reappointed. They
and two new board members are expected to take up the matter of
Crew's contract after they are seated July 7.

METS CALL FRANCO IN EARLY TO BEAT MARLINS 3-2
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By JASON DIAMOS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There was no way Bobby Valentine would have called on
John Franco this early before.
</P>
<P>
   But the bases were loaded with nobody out in the eighth inning
of a one-run game, the rest of Valentine's bullpen was struggling
and the Mets were trying not to become the first team to be swept
in a three-game series by the Florida Marlins this season. So the
Mets manager summoned his closer and hoped for the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby's comment to me was, `We have to put John in, and we
need him to pull a Houdini act,''' Bob Apodaca, the pitching coach,
said. Thirteen pitches and one nearly botched double-play ball
later, Franco pumped his left fist and sprinted off the mound to
end the inning. He had pulled off his own version of the Great
Escape.
</P>
<P>
   For an encore in the ninth, the 37-year-old left-hander shook
off a lead-off walk to hold Florida scoreless and close out his
16th save. He had just preserved a 3-2 victory for the Mets to snap
a four-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Franco's heroics before a Father's Day crowd of 30,673 at Shea
Stadium enabled Al Leiter (9-3) to win his sixth consecutive start.
And should the Mets advance to the playoffs for the first time in a
decade, Sunday's victory might well be remembered long after this
season is over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe this was our hump game,'' Franco said after the Mets had
won for only the fourth time in their last 10 games, all against
the salary-challenged Marlins and Montreal Expos. ``Maybe we needed
this wake-up call. We have played some teams we should beat. But we
haven't. This could be a little kick in the pants, to say, `Hey,
let's get going.'''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets needed something. They are having almost as much
trouble scoring as the U.S. soccer team is in France. Leiter, who
is now 5-0 pitching after a Mets defeat, probably felt fortunate
that he left after seven innings and 120 pitches with a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Even though they were facing 21-year-old Joe Fontenot, who had
an 8.14 earned run average entering the game, the Mets needed a
two-strike wild pitch with Leiter at-bat to tie the game at 2-2 in
the fifth. Their winning rally in the seventh consisted of a Brian
McRae single, a Rey Ordonez sacrifice and a two-out single by
Edgardo Alfonzo.
</P>
<P>
   Fontenot (0-5) allowed just five singles in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   John Hudek began pitching the eighth for the Mets by allowing
single to Todd Zeile. Cliff Floyd greeted Dennis Cook with a
single, Derrick Lee walked and like that, the bases were loaded.
Out went the call for Franco.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have been the bottom of the ninth, with the bases
loaded and no outs,'' said Franco, who barely had enough time to
warm up. ``Hopefully, I won't have to come through that situation
again the rest of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Apodaca said: ``This is by far the earliest we have ever brought
Johnny in. ``And today he saved our bacon.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On his way in from the bullpen, Franco had envisioned a
best-case scenario: He would induce John Wehner into a comebacker
to the mound, which would trigger an easy pitcher-to-home-to-first
double play. But even the best-laid plans run into glitches. On
Franco's first pitch, Wehner grounded right back to him. But with
all the time in the world, he bounced his throw to catcher Mike
Piazza.
</P>
<P>
   ``I alligator-armed it,'' Franco said. ``As soon as I threw, I
turned around because I didn't want to look.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza, who reacted like a hockey goalie, had no such choice.
``He just kind of chunked it, like you chunk a wedge shot,'' Piazza
said. ``He just threw it right into the ground. I don't even know
if it made the dirt.'' Somehow, Piazza was able to avert disaster.
He fielded the short-hop and tagged Zeile out at the plate for the
first out.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing that he had allowed a golden opportunity to slip through
his hands, Franco held his head in his hands on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm known for making things difficult,'' Franco said. ``I'm
just happy I got out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   He did so by striking out Mike Redmond and then the left-handed
hitting Mark Kotsay, pinch-hitting for Fontenot. Franco nearly flew
off the mound, so badly did he want to celebrate what he had just
done with the rest of his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think attitude filters down from the top, whether it's an
organization a corporation or a bullpen,'' Valentine said. ``He's
at the top. His attitude filters down. I really think that can be
part and parcel of everyone else stepping up.''

EDWARD ELISCU, 96, SONGWRITER AND PLAYWRIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., N.Y.)   (bl)  
 By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Edward Eliscu, a lyricist who wrote the words for ``Without a
Song,'' ``Orchids in the Moonlight'' and dozens of other popular
songs, died June 18 at his home in Newtown, Conn. He was 96.
</P>
<P>
   Eliscu was also a playwright, screenwriter and writer for
television, but he was best known as a songwriter. He collaborated
with composers like Gus Kahn, Vincent Youmans, Vernon Duke, Billy
Rose, Jay Gorney and Nacio Herb Brown on songs that included
``Carioca,'' ``More Than You Know,'' ``Flying Down to Rio,''
``Great Day!,'' ``They Cut Down the Old Pine Tree'' and ``Happy
Because I'm in Love.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1976 he was celebrated in the Lyrics and Lyricists series at
the 92nd Street Y in New York. In a review in The New York Times,
John S. Wilson said that Eliscu could be ``identified as a witty
and urbane man with a devotion to social justice as well as the
author of lyrics that say a great more, but in satirical or
emotional terms, than one normally gets from popular songs.''
</P>
<P>
   He was blacklisted in the 1950s because of his outspoken
political views but continued writing for television and theater.
Among his musicals was ``The Banker's Daughter,'' which he wrote
with Sol Kaplan in 1962. He was president of the American Guild of
Authors and Composers from 1968 to 1973 and was later inducted into
the Songwriters' Hall of Fame. In recent years, he collaborated
with the artist Edward Sorel, writing poems that accompanied
Sorel's drawings.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Manhattan and studied at the City College of New
York. He began his career as an actor, appearing on Broadway with
Edward G. Robinson in ``The Racket.'' Then he wrote comedy sketches
and lyrics for ``Meet the People'' and ``The Third Little Show.''
During the 1930s he was in Hollywood, writing movies (for Mae West,
Rita Hayworth and others) as well as songs.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, the painter Stella Bloch, who lives
in Bethel, Conn.; by two sons, David, of Newtown, and Peter, of
Manhattan, and six grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 40 years ago, his obituary, written by The Associated
Press, appeared in The New York Times; it was the ``other'' Edward
Eliscu, who had also been a Hollywood screenwriter, who had died.
The next day, a correction appeared, identifying the two Edward
Eliscus by their primary occupations, the dead one as a retired
lawyer and novelist and the live one as a New York playwright and
lyricist. The live Eliscu took it all in good humor, saying, ``I
never realized how many variations could be squeezed out of the
Mark Twain death report gag.''

COMMENTARY: YOU SAY PRIVATE, I SAY PUBLIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ELIZABETH KOLBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is just after 3 o'clock on a recent afternoon and
the Hamilton Fish Park branch library on the Lower East Side is
beginning to fill with children. First come the older ones, who
stride in purposefully, with knapsacks full of homework. Then come
the very young ones, who have clearly been sent to the library
because it is safer than sending them home to an empty apartment.
</P>
<P>
   The library does seem safe _ there is a guard posted by the door
_ and before the children arrive, at least, the books and chairs
are in order. But it is hard to ignore the general shabbiness.
Paint is peeling and the tables are beaten up. The public bathrooms
are under repair, blocked off by sheets of plastic.
</P>
<P>
   Asked when he expects the repairs to be completed, one librarian
answers sardonically, ``We don't.''
</P>
<P>
   The next day, also at roughly 3 o'clock, well-heeled visitors
are streaming into the Museum of Modern Art. In the sculpture
garden, there are German tourists drinking $2.50 espressos, while
in the gift shop, there is a long line at the cash register, and in
front of Picasso's ``Les Demoiselles d'Avignon,'' so many
fascinated _ or at least footsore _ fans have gathered that there
is no more room on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's wealth is everywhere apparent, indeed virtually on
display. On the second floor, just before you reach Monet's
waterlilies, is a model for a planned expansion, which would,
according to the accompanying description, ``radically reinvent''
the way the Modern presents its collection. Its price tag: $650
million.
</P>
<P>
   In their ugly budget battle, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Peter
Vallone, the City Council speaker, haven't made much secret of
their heartfelt desire to humiliate each other. When you cut not
just the City Council's ``member items,'' but also its own
operating budget, as the mayor recently tried to do, it is clear
that the personal really is the political.
</P>
<P>
   Mixed up in all this wonderfully spiteful and vindictive
squabbling, there is something like a philosophical difference. In
their wrangling, the council and the mayor are consistently at odds
over the basic question of what private institutions should expect
from the public and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   After almost five years in office, Giuliani has made it clear
that he expects public institutions to start pulling their own
weight, and he has encouraged them to seek out private money to
perform basic services like street cleaning and park maintenance.
This year he proposed expanding this concept to the public
libraries, cutting funds they had expected to use to buy books and
pay librarians and urging them to raise the amount from private
sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think public-private partnerships have been a very valuable
resource for making institutions more independent,'' he said,
defending his proposed cuts to libraries like the Hamilton Fish
branch.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the mayor has been unusually generous to some
of the city's most glamorous private enterprises, from rich Wall
Street firms to the even richer New York Yankees. Just as he was
cutting about $15 million from the city's libraries, he was
offering about $65 million to help the Modern finance its ambitious
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   Against the mayor's boundary-blurring style, the members of the
City Council have _ out of principle, political calculation or
sheer inertia _ defended the old pattern. When they got the mayor's
budget, they promptly cut the money for the Modern and restored
funds for the libraries. They have also very vocally opposed the
mayor's plans to finance a new Yankee Stadium, and spoken up for
such mundane services as garbage collection and recycling.
</P>
<P>
   As the battle stands now, the City Council _ somewhat improbably
_ seems to be winning. When the mayor came back with his recent
vetoes, he left in the $15 million the council had added back for
the libraries. But he could not on his own put back money for the
Modern.
</P>
<P>
   When the council overrode his vetoes, it put back yet another $7
million for the libraries and nothing for the Modern.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether the Masters of the Universe who
serve on the museum's board can somehow bend the council to their
will. But that the Modern's expansion will, in any case, move
forward is probably a safe bet.
</P>
<P>
   As to whether the bathroom in the Hamilton Fish library will be
working again any time soon, that's another matter.

ESPADA SAYS INDICTMENT WILL NOT HINDER CAMPAIGN TO REGAIN STATE
SEAT 
</HEADLINE>
  (ja) 
 By JONATHAN P. HICKS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While an indictment might typically signal the
downturn of a politician's prospects, Pedro Espada Jr., a former
state senator from the Bronx, says that his campaign to regain his
old job in Albany will only be energized following his arraignment
on charges of Medicaid fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing that will keep me from waging a vigorous
campaign,'' Espada said in an interview Friday. ``Anyone who has
ever known me understands that when I feel an injustice has been
done, I get up and hit harder and harder.''
</P>
<P>
   Espada, who operates a health clinic in the Bronx, was arraigned
on Wednesday with two of his employees on charges that they
illegally diverted $221,000 in Medicaid money to his failed 1996
re-election campaign and that of his son, Pedro Gautier Espada,
then an assemblyman.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment came a few days after Espada, long a political
foe of the Bronx Democratic Party organization, announced that he
would reverse an earlier decision to stay out of politics and would
run against state Sen. David Rosado to regain his old seat. Espada
has denied the fraud charges and said that they were politically
motivated.
</P>
<P>
   That allegation, several Bronx politicians and political
strategists said, may have influence with the electorate. Michael
Nieves, a political consultant who has worked with several
Democratic candidates in the Bronx, said that Espada ``will almost
certainly spin this in a way where he is the victim, taking on the
big, bad Democratic machine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's a way to motivate people,'' Nieves added.
</P>
<P>
   Espada's indictment also came just days after Espada revealed a
videotape his son had secretly made, recording a conversation on
May 23 between his son and Rosado. In that tape, Rosado boasted of
the Democratic Party's ability to influence the Bronx district
attorney, Robert Johnson, to drop the investigation if Espada
pledged not to run for state Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Espada also said he holds several audiotapes of conversations
between himself and at least two other politicians, including
Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez, the Bronx Democratic leader. Espada
would not disclose the contents of the tapes of Ramirez, saying
only that the Bronx party leader had ``better be careful about what
he denies.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Espada played an audio recording of a conversation
between state Sen. Larry Seabrook and Sandra Love, an employee of
Espada's clinic who was also indicted on fraud charges. On the
tape, Seabrook said he had been the target of investigations that
he described as being motivated by the county Democratic
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Seabrook had planned to run for Congress this year against Rep.
Eliot L. Engel. But after meeting with Ramirez, Seabrook two weeks
ago announced that he had changed his mind and would run for
re-election instead.
</P>
<P>
   Seabrook said at the time that he had not raised enough money or
registered enough voters for his campaign to have been successful.
Seabrook did not return telephone messages on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Espada has said that he and Ramirez, the Democratic
chairman, had agreed that Ramirez would use his influence to
prevent the Bronx district attorney from investigating the clinic
if Espada would refrain from running against Rosado.
</P>
<P>
   Ramirez has denied that there was a deal to that effect with
Johnson, and the district attorney has maintained that political
considerations were never a factor in his investigations. Rosado
has said that he had lied in his taped conversation to serve his
own political purpose _ to eliminate Espada as a potential
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Espada said his family's campaign operation had begun
in earnest. In addition to his own campaign, his brother, Jose
Espada, is running for the Assembly seat now held by Ruben Diaz Jr.
And Espada's son, the city councilman, is running against Rosado
for the position of Democratic district leader.
</P>
<P>
   Both Diaz and Rosado are gearing up for what is likely to be a
passionate battle with the Espadas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court will decide whether there was any wrongdoing,'' Diaz
said. ``But if the Espadas are running in the primary, you can't
take them lightly. They have a presence in the area that cannot be
taken for granted.''

SMALL PROGRAMS FALL VICTIM TO BUDGET BATTLE IN CITY HALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The room was muggy, but the window air-conditioner
had been shut off so no one would miss a word. For five counselors
who helped tenants navigate the city's housing courts, it was their
turn to be shell-shocked. They sat nearly motionless as Larry Wood,
their boss, told them they were being laid off because of a budget
brawl at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nonprofit organizations always live hand to mouth,'' Wood said
apologetically. ``But I didn't expect to be wiped out.''
</P>
<P>
   Wood is chairman of the City-Wide Task Force on Housing Court, a
private group established in 1981 that has an annual budget of
$320,000. The counselors, who each make about $26,000 a year, had
provided assistance at tables set up in housing courts in each
borough since 1981. Now the tables are vacant and people who call
the group's advice line get a recording saying that it cannot offer
help ``due to a loss of funds.''
</P>
<P>
   The City Council had agreed to give the group $263,000 _ about
82 percent of its budget. But Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has taken aim
at $251 million in spending, deriding it as pork, and has vowed not
to spend any of that money.
</P>
<P>
   When the mayor announced Tuesday that he would not honor a
budget that the City Council had adopted and then maintained over
his attempts to veto it, he declared, ``This is not going to really
hurt many people, except the politicians who run the City
Council.''
</P>
<P>
   By week's end, however, charitable groups throughout the city
said they had been forced to scale back their plans and cut their
staffs after deciding they had little chance of receiving the money
promised by the City Council when the new budget year begins on
July 1.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is over seventh-tenths of 1 percent of the $34
billion municipal budget. And caught up in the power struggle
between the Council and the mayor are Little League teams,
health-care support services, advocacy organizations and other
nonprofit groups that depend either largely or entirely on city
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these groups are so small that what the mayor calls
`pork' is going to endanger entire programs and entire
organizations very quickly,'' said Fran Barrett, executive director
of Community Resource Exchange, which helps nonprofit agencies.
``People are fearful that the work they have been doing for years
is about to disappear in a political tussle.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem for these groups is that although the Council voted
overwhelmingly last week to override the mayor's vetoes of spending
he considered irresponsible, he has declared that he still will not
spend the money. The Council plans to take the mayor to court.

<P>
   ``We will utilize the law to prevent him from trying to carry
out all three branches of government by himself,'' Council Speaker
Peter Vallone said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, a champion Little League team in the Bronx will
not get a van to travel to games.
</P>
<P>
   In Queens, members of the Rudy Hepatitis C Support Group (named
not for the mayor but for a man who succumbed to the disease) were
proud of their new educational video on the dangers of tattooing
and body piercing. But the group's leaders say that now they will
not have the cab fare they need to take the video around to
schools, and they are too sick to take the subway.
</P>
<P>
   And in Manhattan, the Roosevelt Island Disabled Association _
whose members have survived polio and strokes, gunshots and
multiple sclerosis _ is cutting back its summer outings from three
to one, since hiring a bus equipped with a wheelchair lift costs
$400 for each trip. That means no trip to Coney Island or the New
York Botanical Garden this year, the association says. The group
had hoped to receive $3,500 from the city, roughly half its annual
budget.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor's office said that dire predictions about the
financial health of the nonprofit groups had proved unwarranted
when they had been raised by Giuliani's critics in previous budget
fights. ``Many advocates and politicians cried wolf, yet today we
have a safer, cleaner city than we've had in decades,'' said Deputy
Mayor Randy Mastro. ``We aim to continue that progress, yet at the
same time insure that the city lives within its means.''
</P>
<P>
   Mastro added that the mayor's proposed budget included record
spending for libraries, day care and summer jobs for youth. ``We're
only talking about the Council adding on more money,'' Mastro said.
</P>
<P>
   Charitable groups, however say they foresee calamity this year
for two reasons. Many of them also lost money when Gov. George
Pataki vetoed 1,000 items from the state budget in April. Among
them was financing for the Legal Aid Society, which had been
holding open several vacancies for lawyers until the fiscal year
began, but now will not fill those slots. Patricia Bath, a
spokeswoman for Legal Aid, said the group expected to lose at least
$2 million because of the budget dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who would lose representation are elderly people
whose benefits have been mistakenly cut off.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't see these people standing outside your office or
outside City Hall,'' Ms. Bath said. ``They're in their apartments,
doing without medicine or telephone service or food.''
</P>
<P>
   The second reason for dismay among nonprofit leaders is the
uncertainty about financing, given the likely court fight. They
explained that even under less volatile circumstances, money from
the city for a fiscal year beginning in July often does not arrive
until fall or early winter because of the time it takes for
contracts to be prepared and approved by the mayor's office. Many
of the groups get loans to meet their payroll and other expenses in
the meantime. But without an assurance that the city money will
actually be forthcoming, lenders may be reluctant, leaders of the
organizations say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Creditors will be concerned about whether we're going to get
the contract, and whether it will be tied up in protracted
litigation,'' said Rick Jones, the deputy director of Neighborhood
Defender Service, a Harlem group that provides legal services to
2,500 families a year. If the budget dispute is not resolved, Jones
said, the service will lose $2 million of its $2.5 million budget
and may close its doors next month.
</P>
<P>
   The mood was just as grim at the Women's Prison Association and
Home Inc., a 155-year-old group that helps addicted convicts and
their children. ``We have two weeks to decide whether to close
programs or lay off staff,'' said executive director Ann Jacobs.
``We tightened our belt when there was a fiscal problem in the
city. But now we're living like this in economically abundant
times.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are groups that are taking a hopeful approach and
mounting quiet lobbying campaigns. Denise Taylor, director of the
Rhinelander Children's Center of the Children's Aid Society, spent
a day writing a letter to the mayor on behalf of a Saturday program
for deaf and hard-of-hearing children who, she wrote, ``would
otherwise be isolated in their community on weekends.''
</P>
<P>
   The weeks ahead will be a time of grim choices, group leaders
say. A dinner program for the elderly, held each weeknight at the
cafeteria of Public School 134 on the Lower East Side, is budgeted
to feed 150 people a day. But the program has become so popular
that often more people than that show up to eat and to watch a
video. Officials of Community Food Resource Center, which runs the
program, had counted on city money to close the gap.
</P>
<P>
   One regular, Susan Lee, said she had voted for Giuliani. ``He
has done a lot of good things,'' said Mrs. Lee, 73, a retired
secretary. ``Now we're disappointed, and we're scared.''

MAYOR'S NEW STRATEGY MAKES IT HARDER TO GET WELFARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By RACHEL L. SWARNS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For years, the poor, the hungry and the jobless have
poured into the squat welfare office on Bergen Street in Brooklyn
where city workers tried to ease the pangs of poverty with
government checks. But today, the primary goal at the office, as a
city manual for the workers states, is to discourage people from
applying at all.
</P>
<P>
   People who push through the smudged glass doors are told to look
for jobs, not welfare, and to lean on relatives, not city charity.
Those who insist on seeking public assistance must hunt for as many
as 20 jobs before getting a formal interview. And two months after
workers began delivering the new message in Brooklyn and at another
office in Queens, the number of welfare applications there has
plummeted.
</P>
<P>
   While 60 percent of the people who walked into those two offices
once ended up on welfare, fewer than 10 percent land on the dole
now, city officials said. It is too early to say whether the
staggering decline can be maintained or replicated citywide, but
the Giuliani administration's strategy will soon transform the
lives of needy adults and children all across New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The policy shift, which is to be adopted by all city welfare
offices over the next nine months, signals the expansion of Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani's efforts to steer the city away from its
traditionally liberal approach to the needy as he increasingly
emphasizes self-reliance over government dependence.
</P>
<P>
   ``People shouldn't have welfare anymore,'' said Mark Hoover, a
deputy commissioner at the city's Human Resources Administration,
which runs the city welfare programs, during a meeting with
officials from community groups earlier this month. ``What they
should have is work and work opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   But the city manual describes employment as a ``secondary
goal.'' The ``primary goal,'' it says, is diverting people from
applying for public assistance while at the same time offering
stopgap subsidies like rent assistance and food stamps.
</P>
<P>
   And it remains unclear whether the people discouraged from
applying for welfare actually find jobs or simply languish in
poverty. City officials declined to release those statistics,
saying they were now analyzing them.
</P>
<P>
   Tightening access to welfare is increasingly popular across the
country, but the strict, systematic approach is new for a city that
has focused more recently on moving welfare recipients into
workfare. Over the last three years, the number of welfare
applications approved citywide has held steady at about 55 percent,
city records show.
</P>
<P>
   But in January, when Giuliani outlined the priorities for his
second term, he vowed to transform welfare offices into ``job
centers'' where the poor would be steered toward jobs, not
government checks. City officials said the plan would ultimately
reduce welfare applications across the city and strengthen poor
communities with its renewed emphasis on work.
</P>
<P>
   In the neighborhood surrounding the Boerum Hill office in
Brooklyn alone, for instance, the strategy is expected to reduce
the welfare rolls by 30 percent over the next three years.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates for the poor, who like several former welfare
officials were stunned by the dramatic drop in applications, fear
that city workers are concentrating less on jobs than on
discouraging people from applying for welfare. They say
discouraging poor, unskilled people is easier than helping them
find jobs in New York City, where the unemployment rate is 7.7
percent, compared with the national rate of 4.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a bogus policy designed to reduce the welfare rolls,''
said Helen Lee, a staff attorney at the Legal Aid Society, who has
begun monitoring the job centers along with other lawyers for the
poor. ``We're afraid needy people aren't getting welfare when they
need it.''
</P>
<P>
   But city officials say that many people find jobs and that those
who need welfare get it. Even those who leave the centers without
jobs or welfare often go home with food stamps and Medicaid that
will help stabilize their lives while they search for work, city
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Once applicants learn that they must show proof of a daily job
search before obtaining welfare, and once they hear that welfare
recipients must sweep streets or answer telephones in exchange for
their benefits, many decide they would rather struggle on their
own, city officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people are successfully finding jobs and making other
choices than before,'' said Hoover, who worked as a welfare
administrator in Wisconsin, which reduced the number of welfare
applications with a similar strategy. ``We feel that families are
going to benefit from this.''
</P>
<P>
   While the debate between city officials and advocates for the
poor remains unresolved, welfare applicants continue to find a
dizzying new world behind the dingy cement walls of the Greenwood
Job Center in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   The caseworkers call themselves financial planners. And the
applicants, called job seekers, watch videos describing job
openings at nursing homes, restaurants and drugstores as they wait
in pink and gray plastic chairs for their interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welfare is time limited,'' signs on the walls say in a pointed
reminder to all who come. ``A job is your future.''
</P>
<P>
   In the old days, people filled out welfare applications on the
first visit and waited at home until the formal eligibility
interview, which was scheduled for about five days later. Today,
job seekers cannot fill out applications until the second visit,
and they must search for work before the eligibility interview and
during the month or so while the application is assessed.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, financial planners help clients explore
``alternatives for independence,'' telling mothers to seek child
support, urging former soldiers to apply for veterans benefits,
requiring laid-off workers to file for unemployment benefits and
assessing whether relatives or churches can help them.

   Damaris Ferrer, 22, her pregnant belly bulging beneath her
T-shirt, was told to consider relying on her mother, who has
supported her with a $537 monthly Social Security check since Ms.
Ferrer left her job as cashier in October. After learning about the
strict job-search requirements, Ms. Ferrer decided to do just that,
at least until the baby is born and she can find another job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping for some help,'' she said last week. ``But I'm
just going to stay with my mother until she throws me out.''
</P>
<P>
   Valerie Rodriguez, an 18-year-old mother, said she also left
Greenwood without being allowed to apply for welfare, food stamps
or health insurance last week. It was her second visit, she said,
and she was told to come back for a third.
</P>
<P>
   But her brother, a waiter who supports Ms. Rodriguez and her
2-year-old son with his $180 weekly check while she studies for her
high school equivalency exam, decided it would be easier for him to
find a second job than for his sister to get public assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been struggling on our own for all this time,'' said Ms.
Rodriguez, her ponytail swinging and her nose-ring sparkling as she
shrugged away the worry in her older brother's eyes. ``I guess
we'll just keep struggling.''
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of city officials, they are success stories, women
who considered their options and chose to avoid the culture of
dependency. Advocates for the poor, however, question whether
people who find it too cumbersome to apply for help can be truly
considered successes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Rodriguez, for instance, who never applied for free health
insurance, plans to rely on Tylenol and prayer, since she has
neither a job nor Medicaid to cover her medical expenses.
</P>
<P>
   But city officials emphasize that poor people will get needed
services if they agree to abide by the new guidelines, and
emergencies will be addressed immediately. And some welfare
applicants support the city's strategy, including Franklin Conde,
40, who is unemployed and now searching for work under the new
strict rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will motivate you,'' said Conde, who applied for welfare
after being unable to find work as an engineer's assistant.
``Whoever established this program is on the right track.''
</P>
<P>
   Welfare specialists say there is little research to dispute or
support that contention, and say city officials should track people
who opt not to apply for welfare to determine whether they find
jobs or languish in poverty. City officials say they plan to do
that, but they have been reluctant in the past to track people who
have left the welfare rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Without careful research, the welfare specialists say, it will
be difficult to determine whether the plan empowers the poor or
makes desperate lives more miserable.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be open to the possibility that the city is right,
that welfare is bad, that dependency breeds more dependency and
robs people of self-sufficiency,'' said Gordon Berlin, a senior
vice president of Manpower Demonstration Research Corp., a
nonprofit group that evaluates the impact of welfare policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you also have to be open to the idea that they're wrong,''
said Berlin, who was responsible for budget and policy at the Human
Resources Administration under Mayor Edward Koch in the late 1980s.
``And if they are, people will have less income, less support, less
stable housing. If they are really stretched thin, then children
and families can get hurt.''

U.S. BLEW CHANCE TO ADVANCE SPORT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Satan,'' just like in Matthew's gospel, was foiled again
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully for U.S. soccer, this humbling won't end up in
someone's sermon 2,000 years from now.
</P>
<P>
   For the proud niche of soccer fans in the United States, there
should be comfort in knowing that their grand game did not disgrace
the nation yesterday in Lyon, France.
</P>
<P>
   No. By the time that the clock ran out on Iran's 2-1 victory,
much of the American viewing audience was either (A) napping or (B)
watching golf on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years of trying to pick up the game by its kneesocks, of
bidding for and then successfully staging the '94 World Cup, of
trying to build a U.S. team that could earn respect on the world
stage _ and this is what they get?
</P>
<P>
   In Iran, where they once referred to us as ``The Great Satan,''
the victory prompted midnight prayers and dancing in the streets.
The Iranians scored two goals, but huge points more for their
sportsmanship and the heart that they showed.
</P>
<P>
   Here at home, alas, it was hard to swallow. In terms of a future
_ read ``corporate dollars'' _ the defeat may not have delivered a
death blow to soccer in this country. But at the moment, consider
it down and bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   For one day, soccer had the U.S. viewing audience mostly to
itself. People who didn't know a soccer ball from a frozen ham
suddenly had a storyline they could sink their teeth into. A Ted
Koppel kind of game. To a lot of Americans, still, mention of Iran
brings back memories of the hostage crisis, the Ayatollah Khomeini
and U.S. flags being burned in the Tehran streets.
</P>
<P>
   And what? You said Team USA was heavily favored?
</P>
<P>
   You bet they watched.
</P>
<P>
   But it was more of the same, wasn't it? The U.S. players'
inability to put the ball in the net turned into a night of
frustration. They hit the crossbar. They hit the goalposts _ three
times. And now, after one more World Cup match, they will hit the
road.
</P>
<P>
   Spare the e-mails, please. They've become trite.
</P>
<P>
   After I penned a fairly light-hearted piece 12 days ago, teasing
how the World Cup gets lost in the U.S. translation, I received a
spate of electronic dispatches rife with name-calling and
high-handed piety.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Pitney of Arlington wrote, ``Your refusal to learn the game
amounts to intellectual bankruptcy and until you take the time to
really understand the `game within the game' you really should
limit your comments to those sports you understand!''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, yes, the ``game within the game'' of soccer. At least two of
the e-mail writers claimed that soccer is now the preferred sport
of ``intelligent people,'' and thus they understood perfectly why
only they grasped its nuances _ and, apparently, I didn't.
</P>
<P>
   While they were memorizing Chaucer, I suppose, they must have
missed the fact that nowhere in the earlier column did I say I
didn't like soccer, the apparent Official Game of Mensa. I simply
strove to make points about the World Cup's lack of scoring,
particularly the U.S. team's. And while praising World Cup '94 for
its success, despite the rest of the world's skepticism, I noted
how the great event still doesn't captivate the same throngs on our
shores.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, I think I was on the same mailing list as Salman
Rushdie.
</P>
<P>
   ``You people are morons if you can't see that soccer is HUGE
with an educated segment of the population,'' read one of the
unsigned notes.
</P>
<P>
   I give up. What don't we morons understand?
</P>
<P>
   There's offsides. There's corner kicks. There are yellow cards
and red cards. Soccer is not rocket science. As has been proven
many times at the World Cup, the coaches don't even need to speak
the players' language.
</P>
<P>
   The best e-mail comment, as it turned out, came from a truly
erudite gentleman named Norm Biven. He called my attention to the
commercial that Nike is running during the Cup telecasts. It shows
the defending world champs from Brazil stuck during a flight delay
at the Rio airport. They begin playing with the soccer ball, while
a samba from Sergio Mendes plays in the background.
</P>
<P>
   They and the ball go through X-ray machines, under taxiing jet
wings, down baggage ramps, before the world's best player, Ronaldo,
finishes with a footwork exhibition that would make the
Globetrotters envious. The punch line is that Ronaldo gets to the
terminal gate, kicks _ and clangs it off the metal post.
</P>
<P>
   The kids watching frown. Ronaldo shrugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because Ronaldo's shot clangs off the post at the end
doesn't make it any less entertaining,'' Biven wrote. ``It's not
the scoring. It's the samba, silly.''
</P>
<P>
   I know. But again, thanks to days like yesterday, it gets lost
in the translation.
</P>
<P>
   Americans love underdogs, but they enjoy winning more. The samba
is fine, but the preferred tune, last time I checked, was ``We Will
Rock You.'' Tennis' Davis Cup was big once here, too _ until the
United States started losing it.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. soccer blew it big time yesterday. It doesn't take a genius
to see that it's going to be a tough four years.

CONTRACT PROMISES JOB SECURITY FOR 50,000 HOSPITAL WORKERS
</HEADLINE>
   (ja) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Thirty-five private hospitals and nursing homes in
New York City reached a tentative agreement Sunday that provides
far-reaching job-security provisions for 50,000 workers despite the
wrenching upheaval in the city's health-care industry.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when many experts are estimating that New York's
hospitals have to cut their work force by 15 percent over the next
five years, the agreement reduces pressures for layoffs by tapping
the union's pension plan to finance an unusual early retirement
program.
</P>
<P>
   The 40-month contract, negotiated by 1199, the National Health
and Human Service Employees Union, provides for diverting more than
$135 million from the union's overfunded pension plan to finance
the early retirements _ most payments would be $25,000 in cash _ to
encourage at least 3,000 hospital workers to retire early.
</P>
<P>
   This early retirement plan was made possible, both sides
acknowledged, by the Wall Street boom, which fattened the pension
plan's reserves, and by some unusual bargaining.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis Rivera, 1199's president, announced the contract Sunday
after two days of nonstop negotiations with the League of Voluntary
Hospitals, a group of 35 private nonprofit institutions including
Beth Israel, Montefiore, Mount Sinai, Presbyterian and St.
Vincent's hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   As in the current contract, the new agreement virtually bars
layoffs of workers hired before Sept. 17, 1992, saying they can be
laid off only if the institution closes or is in perilous financial
condition. Union officials estimate that the rule applies to 75
percent of the union's workers at the hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   If workers hired after that date are laid off, they are to
receive, with the help of unemployment insurance, 80 percent of
their pay for two years _ up from 18 months in the current
contract. In addition, they are given the right to the first job
opening for which they are qualified at any of the 35 institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This contract will offer virtual job security,'' said Rivera,
who said that the contract provides no-layoff guarantees to more
employees than any other multi-employer contract in the nation. He
predicted that if any less experienced workers were laid off,
almost all would be able to find other jobs in league institutions
within two years.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides said the agreement would enable the hospitals to
reduce employment gradually, and thus become more efficient and
keep costs for patients under control.
</P>
<P>
   After the negotiations were completed at 10:30 Sunday morning,
Rivera was visibly exhausted in a news conference at 1199's
headquarters on West 43rd Street, saying at one point that he
needed to sit down. The union's 150-member negotiating committee
unanimously approved the agreement Sunday, and the 50,000 workers
are scheduled to vote on it over the next two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing details of the agreement, Rivera said he was
calling off plans for the 50,000 workers to go on strike on June
30, the day their current contract expires.
</P>
<P>
   The new contract covers laundry, housekeeping and food workers,
custodial staff and X-ray and laboratory technicians _ as a group
they average $30,000 a year in wages. The contract provides for a 3
percent raise for the first year, an $1,800 lump sum bonus in the
second year and a 3 percent raise over the contract's last 16
months.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Appearing beside Rivera at the news conference, Bruce McIver,
president of the hospitals league, said: ``Neither of us got
everything we wanted. There was a lot of compromise.'' Nonetheless,
the hospitals obtained several important concessions, including a
bonus rather than a wage increase in the second year.
</P>
<P>
   The Wall Street boom has created hundreds of millions of dollars
in overfunding in the pension plan, whose assets are invested in
stocks and bonds. Thanks to that overfunding, the contract gives
the health-care institutions more than $100 million in savings in
their pension contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The hospitals will not have to make any contributions for 10
months to the pension plan and during the rest of the contract will
pay 6.25 percent of payroll in pension contributions, down from
6.75 percent at present.
</P>
<P>
   McIver insisted that the contract was not overly generous and
would not create an undue strain on the hospitals. ``A 6 percent
wage increase over 40 months isn't bad,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera said he was proudest of the contract's job-security
provisions, predicting that other health-care unions around the
nation would seek to match them. He noted that for the first time,
part-time workers hired before September 17, 1992, would be covered
by the strong no-layoff language.
</P>
<P>
   ``Management told us for months that it needed to lay off
thousands of our members, that the employment-security provisions
in our old contract could not stand,'' Rivera said. ``In fact, with
this contract, we have won improved security guarantees, the
biggest early retirement package in our history, as well as
increases in wages and health coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the new contract, the workers will no longer have to make
co-payments or any other payment to their dental plan. They already
do not have to pay premiums or make co-payments in their basic
health insurance plan.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement provides for the hospitals and nursing homes to
contribute a total of $60 million a year to a retraining and job
security fund, which will be used to retrain laid off workers and
pay them the equivalent of 80 percent of their wages for two years.
That $60 million will come largely from money the hospitals save on
pension contributions. The job security fund, although at far
smaller levels, was first set up in the contract negotiated in
1992, while the no-layoff provisions were first negotiated in the
1994 contract.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Rivera said that in negotiations, he had
originally pushed to extend the no-layoff clause to cover more
workers but that management had sought to reduce the coverage. He
said he dropped his demand when management insisted that in
exchange it be given the right to lay off experienced workers when
hospitals merge.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new early-retirement program, workers 62 years old
with 20 years on the job will be entitled to a full pension, but
under the current contract, they must have 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   As further incentive, workers 62 years old with 20 years on the
job, or 65 with five years on the job, are being offered not just a
full pension but also a $25,000 one-time payment and health
insurance until they qualify for Medicare,
</P>
<P>
   Workers as young as 55 would be offered $25,000 payments and
varying combinations of health-care and pension coverage to accept
early retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators estimated all these measures would cost $135 million
to $150 million and would persuade 3,000 to 3,700 workers to retire
early.
</P>
<P>
   The union made no headway toward one of its chief goals, a
promise from the hospitals not to fight its effort to unionize
thousands of workers at the hospitals' satellite clinics throughout
the metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators for both sides acknowledged that they felt
considerable pressure to reach an agreement before the June 30
contract expiration. Hospital executives wanted to avoid the burden
of running their institutions during a strike. Union officials
feared that some hospitals might order large-scale layoffs of
long-time workers once the present contract contract expired and
left them without protection against layoffs.

STEWART, LEHMAN CAN'T STAY ON COURSE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Olympic Club added to its U.S. Open legacy
yesterday when another 54-hole leader stumbled down the stretch and
lost the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   For those counting at home, the course is now four-for-four in
producing dramatic, comeback winners at the Open. The latest to
fall, Payne Stewart, added his name to a list that also includes
Ben Hogan (1955), Arnold Palmer (1966) and Tom Watson (1987). All
were reeled in at Olympic by players with fewer career victories on
the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say the golf course won. The golf course lived up to its
reputation,'' Stewart said after flushing a four-stroke lead in the
final round and losing by a stroke to Lee Janzen.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart joined Tom Lehman, his final-round playing partner, as
the two sympathetic characters in the latest Olympic melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to control his driver down the stretch, Stewart hit his
fewest number of fairways (six) and greens in regulation (nine) of
any round during Open week while ballooning to a 74. Lehman, a
sentimental favorite who was playing in the final group at the Open
for a fourth consecutive year, fell short once again in his Open
quest with a closing 75.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said \RSaturday\S that if I played the type of game Payne
Stewart can play, I'd be standing here with the trophy. And I
didn't do that,'' Stewart said. ``Plus, Lee Janzen shot 68 on a day
when nobody else in contention could break par. He deserves to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed. But this isn't going to change my life. I
didn't play well enough to win. It's as simple as that. And it
won't take me very long at all to get over this. I'll still be able
to sleep tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman indicated he may be missing a few winks for the
foreseeable future because he was ``irritated with myself'' after
falling short in the Open for a fourth consecutive year. The failed
54-hole leader at the past three Opens, Lehman began yesterday's
final round four strokes in back of Stewart and never made a
birdie.
</P>
<P>
   He placed fifth, which comes on the heels of finishes of third
(1995), second (1996) and third (1997).
</P>
<P>
   By his calculations, Lehman never gave himself a decent birdie
chance until the 11th hole. Then, he failed to capitalize on three
in a row.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time I made bogey on 14, I knew I was history,'' Lehman
said. ``For the last two days, I've had the hardest time reading
the greens. I could never tell if we were going uphill or downhill.
Therefore, I never came close to making one.''
</P>
<P>
   Lehman left the course displaying a unique mix of iron-willed
determination and heart-tugging frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can keep playing this well in this tournament for the
next four or five years, I think I'm going to win one. Or two, or
three or four,'' Lehman said. ``But the last thing I want to do
right now is play golf. This is a big tournament and I'm
disappointed. I'm a little bit irritated with myself. It's very
frustrating to go through this again, I'll be honest with you.''

CLARK ON A ROLL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Will Clark's reaching 100 runs batted in this
season remains a distinct possibility for the Rangers first
baseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be nice, but that's not something I came into the
season looking to do,'' said Clark, who entered last night's game
against the Angels with 42 RBI through the Rangers' first 73 games.
``Obviously, it's going to be tough when you've got a guy hitting
in front of you on pace to drive in 190.''
</P>
<P>
   Right fielder Juan Gonzalez no doubt diminishes the likelihood
of Clark reaching that plateau for the first time in the past seven
seasons. Clark drove in 116 runs for the San Francisco Giants in
1991.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Clark _ who hits primarily fifth in the Rangers'
lineup _ is on pace to drive in 93 runs this season.
</P>
<P>
   Rangers manager Johnny Oates utilized Clark as his designated
hitter last night for the second consecutive game. Clark continues
to experience discomfort in his left elbow.
</P>
<P>
   ``His left arm is not 100 percent,'' Oates said. ``We're getting
ready to go to a National League park \RWednesday\S, so I thought
this was a good time for this. It's just precautionary. I could
have played him at first base \Rlast night\S.''
Oliver ready The Rangers expect left-hander Darren Oliver to make
his scheduled start Friday against the Giants in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver, whom the Rangers placed on the 15-day disabled list June
13 (retroactive to June 11) with a muscle strain in his left
shoulder, experienced no discomfort during yesterday's medical
rehabilitation start for Triple-A Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver, who did not figure in the decision in the RedHawks' 6-5
loss to Memphis, surrendered only two hits and one walk during five
scoreless innings.
Van Poppel a go Oates reiterated yesterday right-hander Todd Van
Poppel will start Thursday against the Arizona Diamondbacks in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   One catch exists: Van Poppel will be required to hit in the
National League ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him today how much he's been hitting lately,'' Oates
said. ``We'll give him a crash course when we get home.''
No local TV Last night's game was the Rangers' first regular-season
game not televised since Sept. 11, 1996, at Toronto. The 7 p.m.
start time interfered with ESPN's exclusive telecast window that
affects road-game telecasts.
Briefly Right-hander Tanyon Sturtze, who underwent arthroscopic
surgery to repair a tear in his right rotator cuff in February,
made his first appearance this season Saturday for the Rangers'
rookie affiliate in the Gulf Coast League. Sturtze allowed three
runs _ two earned _ on three hits, including a home run, and two
walks during two innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers entered last night's contest without a stolen base
during their past 12 games. That represents their longest streak of
the season without a stolen base.
Farm report Triple-A Oklahoma (Pacific Coast League): Left-hander
Ricky Pickett (1-1) earned the victory in relief as the RedHawks
(39-27) beat Memphis, 8-6, Saturday in 11 innings. Outfielder Marc
Sagmoen went 2-for-6 with two RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Double-A Tulsa (Texas League): Second baseman Warren Morris went
2-for-4 with two RBI, and center fielder Ruben Mateo homered as the
Drillers (34-41) defeated Jackson, 6-2, Saturday. Right-hander
Danny Kolb (4-9, 5.00) allowed only two runs during eight innings
for the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Class-A Savannah (South Atlantic League): The Sand Gnats (35-39)
lost both games in Saturday's doubleheader of seven-inning games
against Augusta. First baseman Travis Hafner went 1-for-2 with a
double and a run scored during an 8-2 loss in the first game, and
center fielder Anthony Fisher went 2-for-3 with two RBI in an 8-1
defeat in the second game.

CHRISTOPHER SHAYS: GOP MAVERICK PUSHING CAMPAIGN FINANCE BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Mass., Ohio, Ind., N.Y.)   (bl)  
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ To all the world, this would seem to be Rep.
Christopher Shays' moment in the sun.
</P>
<P>
   He is chief spokesman and rabble-rouser on the hot congressional
issue of the summer, his bill to toughen campaign finance laws.
Good-government groups, Democrats and editorial writers are calling
him a hero for defying his party leadership, which wants to kill
his legislation. Even critics say that martyrdom, if it comes to
that, may only increase his stature.
</P>
<P>
   So why does he seem so anguished?
</P>
<P>
   ``My melancholy nature is because I'm in a position I don't like
to be in,'' Shays, from Stamford, Conn., said last week. ``I am a
Republican who can't be proud of how my Republicans are conducting
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Shays has become the reluctant general in an uprising he helped
ignite. For much of his 11 years in Congress, he has been an
iconoclastic champion of reform and moderate causes, challenging
the conservatives who control his party on issues from abortion to
gun control to the minimum wage. But his party credentials never
seemed in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Until now. With the party expecting a fierce fight this fall to
retain control of the House, Shays has allied himself with
Democrats behind legislation that many Republicans believe will
strip away their party's fund-raising advantages. And so, the
murmured questions about his loyalty and back-room calls for his
punishment have grown louder.
</P>
<P>
   It is a position Shays does not seem to relish, even though
taking shots at the party seems like good politics for moderate
Republicans these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen some Republicans who are amused by being able to put
their thumb in the eye of the party,'' said Rep. John Kasich,
R-Ohio, who is one of Shays' closest friends in the House. ``Chris
is never that way. He feels bad whenever he's at odds with the
party.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Kasich added, ``feeling bad doesn't stop him from doing
what he thinks is right.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is a bill sponsored by Shays and Rep. Martin Meehan,
D-Mass., that would ban ``soft money,'' which is used for party
expenses like voter registration drives and can be collected in
unlimited sums, in Federal elections. The measure would also
restrict campaign-related advertising by groups like the Christian
Coalition, the National Rifle Association and unions.
</P>
<P>
   The bill has placed the Republicans in an exquisite bind. Party
leaders oppose it because it would curb practices that helped them
win control of Congress four years ago. But blocking an overhaul of
a system that many voters seem to consider out of control will also
hand Democrats a major issue this fall as they try to trim the
Republicans' 11-vote majority in the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he continues on this so-called reform, he is going to
endanger the Republican Congress that has done more to reform the
federal government than any other entity,'' said John Feerhery, a
spokesman for House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, who is
leading the fight against Shays' bill.
</P>
<P>
   The leadership has settled on a strategy to weaken, or at least
stall, the bill by allowing debate on more than 200 amendments.
Friday, Shays and his allies beat back the first of those
amendments, but they acknowledged that it is far too early to
declare victory.
</P>
<P>
   Shays has tried to play on his leadership's anxieties about
November, warning them that the Republicans are more likely to lose
seats if they kill his bill than if they surrender fund-raising
advantages. ``Some Republicans feel that I am advocating something
that hurts the party,'' he said. ``I feel vociferously that I am
helping to save the party.''
</P>
<P>
   But that argument seems only to anger some Republicans. Indeed,
at the urging of conservatives, House Speaker Newt Gingrich
recently warned Shays, who heads the government Reform and
Oversight's human resources subcommittee, and other Republicans
that they will lose their committee assignments if they help the
Democrats dictate debate on campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even people who admire Chris' independence think this isn't a
good time to put the party in a box, right before the election,''
said Rep. Mark Souder, R-Ind., who is friendly with Shays. ``It's
helping to fuel some pressures internally to take committee
assignments away from people like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Shays, 52, hardly seems the type to lead an uprising. He is
soft-spoken and oddly modest for a politician. He allows staff
workers to interrupt and contradict him. He does not mind saying,
``I don't know.'' And he insists on calling his bill Meehan-Shays,
though everyone else knows it as Shays-Meehan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not by nature a maverick,'' said Rep. Barney Frank,
D-Mass. ``He's a cheek turner. But on campaign finance, he ran out
of cheeks.''
</P>
<P>
   But he is also stubborn _ piously so, some critics say. Shays
often talks about how his opponents are ``morally wrong.'' And as a
member of the Connecticut state Legislature 13 years ago, he served
six days in jail on a contempt charge when he refused to retreat in
a confrontation with a judge he considered corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he comes to a decision, he comes to it from a strongly
religious background,'' Rich Galen, executive director of GOPAC,
the Republican political action committee, said of Shays, a
Christian Scientist. ``And once he does, he is absolutely confident
it is the right decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Shays does not talk much about campaign finance when he is at
home in the 4th District, which stretches along Long Island Sound
from Greenwich to Bridgeport. But his socially moderate,
independent-minded Yankee Republicanism clearly plays well there.
His predecessors in the House, Lowell Weicker and Stewart McKinney,
were cut from similar cloth. And Shays has won most of his races
handily.
</P>
<P>
   His centrist politics reflect the mixed nature of his district.
On a recent weekend at home, Shays spent an afternoon helping to
build a house in a poor neighborhood of Bridgeport with Habitat for
Humanity, then spoke before the Darien Republican Club in a house
that is expected to sell for more than $2 million once construction
is finished. He ended his tour at a fund-raising event for a health
clinic that serves low-income children from Stamford.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a real human being,'' Andrew McBride, a former health
official in Stamford, told the crowd. ``Even though he happens to
be a Republican.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Newt Gingrich is not a popular figure in the district. In 1996,
Democrats cut Shays' share of the vote to 60 percent, from 74
percent in 1994, and almost defeated his Republican colleague from
New Britain, Rep. Nancy Johnson, largely by linking them to the
speaker.
</P>
<P>
   But often in defiance of his own aides, Shays has remained an
ardent Gingrich loyalist. Even as he has bashed the Republican
leadership on campaign finance, he has been careful to blunt
attacks of Gingrich personally.
</P>
<P>
   Shays says he became a fan of Gingrich after he and his wife of
30 years, Betsi, heard him speak in Connecticut in 1991. ``We
thought, `My God, we agree with 90 percent of what he said,'''
Shays recalled. ``When he is inspired, when he focuses on his
positive hopes and dreams for our country, he can be a genius.''
</P>
<P>
   Shays became an early advocate of the Contract With America,
defended Gingrich during a 1995 ethics investigation, and was one
of the first people to warn the speaker of plans of a coup against
him by conservatives last year. Such fidelity has gained him
nothing, Shays says.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will not reward me as his friend,'' Shays said, ``but he
will certainly punish me as his opponent.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Democratic leaders, who plan to attack Shays' ties
to Gingrich again this year, say he has tried to play both ends
against the middle, supporting fiscally conservative policies that
have hurt his district while attacking Republicans on issues like
campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I view Chris as a great opportunist who is kind of a
chameleon,'' said Edward Marcus, chairman of the state Democratic
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Reared in Darien, Shays has been a Republican for as long as he
can remember. But he supported George McGovern in 1972 out of
revulsion with Watergate and the war. And though he voted for
Richard Nixon in 1960, it was John F. Kennedy's message of public
service that inspired him to join the Peace Corps in 1968 along
with his wife, Betsi. Mrs. Shays is now a seventh grade social
studies teacher in New Canaan; the couple have an 18-year-old
daughter, Jeramy.
</P>
<P>
   After two years teaching English in Fiji, Shays returned home
and applied to be a conscientious objector against the war in
Vietnam. He was turned down, but was never drafted. If he had been,
``I would have gone to jail before I would have gone to serve,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Though it angers him to hear Republicans question his loyalty,
Shays seems to go out of his way to tell colleagues that he cares
about his party. During a chance encounter in the Capitol last week
with Rep. Bill Paxon, R-N.Y., who is helping the party candidate in
a special election in New Mexico on Tuesday, Shays said: ``I sent
two checks for $500. I wanted you to know I was concerned.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would ever change parties, Shays bristled.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I go down, I am going down as a Republican,'' he said. ``If
anything, I feel even more strongly the need to fight back.''

AZINGER CLOSES STRONG
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Paul Azinger finished with a flurry, bagging
eight birdies in the final round and shooting a 65, lowest score
during any round at the 1998 U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   Azinger hit 11 greens in regulation and needed just 25 putts to
move from 55th to 14th place in the tournament, at 9-over.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can shoot that kind of score, you take it no matter
what day it is,'' Azinger said. ``I wish I'd played better early in
the week, but I didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Azinger said he came into yesterday's round with 65 as a goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt if I shot 65, I might finish in the top 15. I knew that
would get me back into the tournament next year,'' said Azinger,
who reached his goal of a berth in the 1999 Open when several
front-runners backtracked during the afternoon. ``I really woke up
thinking about a 65. It's pretty amazing I shot it.''
Martin misses Masters invite Casey Martin took three bogeys and no
birdies on his back nine in the final round, costing him a chance
to finish in the top 16 and earn a berth in the 1999 Masters.
Instead, Martin's final-round effort of 72 left him at 11 over and
in 23rd place in his Open debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get into the Masters, but that's the way it
goes,'' said Martin, a disabled golfer who became the first player
in Open history to compete while using a golf cart. ``I played well
but not my absolute best. I think I have more game than what I
showed.''
</P>
<P>
   As for special memories of the 1998 Open, Martin said: ``The way
I was treated by the galleries, with everyone rooting for me. At
times, I got goosebumps ... because people were so supportive.
That's what I'll take as special from this week.''
Kuchars party on U.S. Amateur champ Matt Kuchar will always
remember his 20th birthday, which he celebrated yesterday by
draining an 18-foot par putt on the final hole to seal a berth in
the 1999 Open. He did so on Father's Day, with father/caddie Peter
Kuchar carrying the clubs in Matt's Open debut.
</P>
<P>
   The putt gave Kuchar a share of 14th place and an automatic
berth in the 1999 Open. The top 15 finishers receive automatic
berths the ensuing year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a higher goal. I wanted to see how high I could get my
name up on the leader board,'' Matt Kuchar said. ``But it's
outstanding to ... get to come back.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Kuchar said: ``I couldn't think of a better Father's Day
present. If the next 20 years are as good as the first 20, we're in
for quite a ride.''
Struggling home Fort Worth resident Mark Brooks split six of 14
fairways and hit just five greens in regulation during a closing
round of 76. Both figures stood as tournament lows for Brooks, who
finished 57th, at 18-over par.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit some good shots and a lot of bad ones. It's been a tough
week,'' said Brooks, who finished two strokes behind defending
champ Ernie Els (16 over).
</P>
<P>
   Els, who closed with a 76, downplayed the back injury that has
plagued him since he withdrew from last week's Buick Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to blame my play on my back. My putting is what
let me down more than anything,'' said Els, who needed 33 putts
yesterday and averaged 32.5 putts per round. ``Plus, this is the
toughest golf course I've ever played in an Open. You couldn't do
anything wrong this weekend and shoot par.''
</P>

   British Open champ Justin Leonard finished at 14 over but closed
with a birdie and six pars down the stretch during a round of 71
that matched his best of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I leave here with a little better taste in my mouth,'' Leonard
said. ``But I still didn't make any putts.''
Briefly One day after driving the green at the 288-yard seventh
hole to set up a two-putt birdie, John Daly five-putted the seventh
green in yesterday's final round. Included was a backhand miss from
less than a foot that capped a quadruple-bogey eight. Daly closed
with a 78 and finished 17 over.

<P>
   Chris Perry, on the overall experience of Open week at the
Olympic Club: ``You make the cut and go, `I've got to go through
two more rounds of this?' This course doesn't turn men into boys.
It turns men into children. It makes us pros look like
15-handicappers.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods, after finishing 10-over with a closing 73: ``I've
never had to hit cuts and draw off every tee to keep it in the
fairway before. I think I learned something this week. I hit the
ball better than I scored.''

   News that The Boston Globe had asked last week for the
resignation of Patricia Smith, a metropolitan region columnist,
because of fabrications in her work, prompted self-examination at
other newspapers around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes us rethink for sure,'' said George Langford, the
public editor at The Chicago Tribune, who acts as the newspaper's
ombudsman. ``It certainly sharpens your antennae. I suppose that's
about the only good thing I can see coming out of it, because it
certainly is very damaging to all of us.''
</P>
<P>
   While fact-checking departments have long been a tradition at
some magazines, daily newspapers have largely relied on their
reporters when it comes to accuracy. Because of the pressures of
daily deadlines and the volume of copy coursing through a newsroom
in any given night, newspapers say they have no choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``We learned that these organizations inevitably depend on
trust,'' said Robert Kaiser, managing editor of The Washington
Post, alluding to the case of Janet Cooke, a reporter who admitted
to creating a composite of an inner-city youth for an article that
won the Pulitzer Prize. ``If there is a system that can guarantee
things of this kind can't happen, I haven't heard of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have such a system, and I guess I think that the
Patricia Smith episode may be evidence of why there's no point in
it really,'' Kaiser continued _ ``why it can't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Joseph Lelyveld, the executive editor of The New York
Times, said, ``We operate from a position of trust in our
reporters.''
</P>
<P>
   To the extent that newspapers have safeguards, editors say,
these are their many levels of editing. Langford said the Chicago
Tribune's first line of defense was its ``source'' editors, editors
who deal with content. After that, Langford said, articles go
through the copy desk.
</P>
<P>
   At The Wall Street Journal, the managing editor, Paul Steiger,
said an article could go through a varying number of editors,
depending on its importance and where it will run in the paper. ``A
page one story can have five, sometimes six, levels of editors,''
he said. ``Small, inside news stories will have two.''
</P>
<P>
   While columnists have more room to offer their opinions or
analysis, Steiger said, ``The checking process is the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Loeb, editor of The Columbia Journalism Review,
suggested that newspapers consider instituting fact-checking
procedures for particular kinds of articles. ``A newspaper would be
well served if it had available some fact checkers to examine and
raise questions about certain complicated and controversial stories
or series of stories,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure that Ms. Smith had concocted people and quotes in
at least four columns earlier this year was particularly dramatic,
given that it became public just a week after The New Republic
concluded that Stephen Glass, a staff writer, fabricated all or
part of 27 of the 41 articles he wrote for the magazine in two and
a half years.
</P>
<P>
   But editors say incidents of fakery remain few. Leo Wolinsky,
managing editor for news at The Los Angeles Times, said about 10
years ago a reporter was dismissed after making up quotations that
he contended came from a news-agency dispatch. (It turned out that
the reporter had altered the wire story to include the fabricated
quotes.) Wolinsky said another reporter was dismissed for
plagiarizing from a script for public television.

<P>
   In response to the Globe incident, Wolinsky said Michael Parks,
the editor of The Los Angeles Times, had asked his staff to reflect
on the situation at their early-morning meeting. ``He asked us to
think about what we're doing and whether we're on the right path,''
Wolinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Wolinsky, as well as several other editors interviewed, said
they were surprised to learn that Matthew Storin, editor of The
Globe, a New York Times Co. newspaper, had established a
spot-checking system of columnists a couple of years ago. ``That's
something I didn't know took place anywhere,'' Wolinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Seaton, president of the American Society of Newspaper
Editors, said his organization was about to come out with a study
that examined the extent to which newspaper credibility had
declined. ``Newspapers have declined more than other media,''
Seaton said. ``We're concerned about that.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent informal study on corrections, the society found
that 21 newspapers had formal procedures for finding out how an
error occurred and 35 had informal procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Seaton also said that the society was reviewing its decision to
give a distinguished-writing award to Ms. Smith earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Smith case, coupled with the Glass incident, has prompted
publications to speculate about what would drive a reporter to
cross the bright line from fact into fiction. Was it the pressure
to produce, to stand out, to sustain a heady level of success?
</P>
<P>
   ``There certainly is more pressure these days to make newspapers
more compelling to readers,'' Wolinsky said. ``Everybody wants to
be special and everybody wants their stories to be talked about and
read, and the truth about it is most people don't have such
scintillating quotes. And if they could make it up themselves, it
would read a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   Although editors generally said the Smith and Glass cases had
not prompted them to change their policies, several said these,
along with the frenzied Monica Lewinsky coverage, had made them
more cautious. ``We're more circumspect today,'' Langford of The
Chicago Tribune said. ``The downside is just too great.''
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how careful, editors insisted, a newspaper cannot
completely prevent such violations. ``Absent some kind of Draconian
_ `give me a photograph and the driver's license of everyone you've
quoted,''' Kaiser of The Washington Post said, ``someone who had
the inclination to do this sort of thing could probably get away
with it.''
