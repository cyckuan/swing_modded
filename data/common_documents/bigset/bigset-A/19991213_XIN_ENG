<HEADLINE> Majority of Greeks Welcome Helsinki Decision on Turkey's EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The overwhelming majority of
Greeks welcomed the agreement reached at the European Union (EU)
Helsinki summit concerning Turkey's EU candidate status, according
to a poll published in the Athens newspaper "Ethnos" Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The poll showed that 31.1 percent of those surveyed view the
Greek government's policy as "very positive," 42.7 percent as "
somewhat positive," 13.4 percent as "somewhat negative" and 8.3
percent as" very negative."
</P>
<P>
The EU this weekend offered Turkey the status of a candidate
for membership, along with a number of conditions that resulted
from intense diplomatic negotiations between the Greek government
and its EU partners.
</P>
<P>
The specific conditions for Turkey to become an EU candidate
country include that a solution to the Cyprus problem would not be
a precondition for an EU decision on the island republic's
accession, Turkey's various territorial disputes with Greece be
referred to the International Court of Justice at the Hague within
a specific time frame and the same conditions apply to Turkey as
to the 11 other candidates states.
</P>
<P>
While voicing his satisfaction with the EU decision, Greek
Prime Minister Costas Simitis said that the decision was "historic
for regional peace, cooperation and development."
</P>
<P>
But the political parties of the opposition have mixed reaction
to the EU decision.
</P>
<P>
Greece's main opposition New Democracy (ND) leader Costas
Karamanlis Sunday said that Turkey gained great benefits with the
EU Helsinki summit.
</P>
<P>
He termed positive the references on Cyprus' EU accession but
that with regard Greek-Turkish relations "the development was
unsatisfactory because Turkey did not commit itself to respect
international law, avoid the use of violence and not have claims
against neighboring countries."
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of Greece (KKE) spoke of a defeat in the
Cyprus issue and of giving away new sovereign rights.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Social Movement criticized the Greek government
for its unacceptable stance and called on the people to express
their opposition peacefully.
</P>
<P>
The Liberal Party expressed its absolute satisfaction over the
government stance.

<HEADLINE> 2 Iraqi Children Killed, 5 injured in U.S. Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Two Iraqi children were
killed and six others including five children injured on Sunday
in U.S. and British warplanes attacks on civilian and service
installations in northern Iraq, an Iraqi military spokesman
announced.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 10:47 a.m. (0747 GMT) seven
formations of U.S. and British warplanes coming from the Turkish
airspace bombed some civilian and service facilities in northern
Iraq's Erbil, Neineva and Dohuk provinces, leading to the
civilian casualties and destruction of three houses.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that civilian casualties were reported
in U.S. and British air raids since the holy fasting month of
Ramadan started four days ago in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that Iraqi anti-aircraft units fired back
at the enemy planes and forced them to flee back to their base in
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He added that at 10:35 a.m. (0735 GMT) seven formations of U.S
and British warplanes coming from Saudi and Kuwaiti bases
violated southern Iraqi airspace over Thi-Qar, Muthana and
Qadissiya provinces, adding that Iraqi air defenses repulsed the
enemy planes.
</P>
<P>
Since last December's air strikes against Iraq, U.S. and
British warplanes have made 16,702 sorties over the two no-fly
zones in Iraq and have targetted regularly its civilian and
military targets, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed on Iraq by the U.S.-led western
allies following the 1991 Gulf War with the claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in the
south from attacks by Iraqi government troops.
</P>
<P>
Iraq does not recognize these restricted zones, saying they
were unilaterally imposed by the U.S. and Britain without direct
authorization from the U.N. Security Council.

<HEADLINE> 14 Militant Suspects Tried in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 12 (Xinhua) -- An Egyptian security court on
Sunday began trial of 14 Islamic militant suspects, who are
accused of taking part in violent anti-government activities.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme State Security Court opened hearings and listened
to three witnesses, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The court decided to continue the trial on Monday to listen to
accounts by more witnesses, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
The 14 defendants are charged with joining illegal groups,
assassinating public officials and seeking to topple the Egyptian
government, it added.
</P>
<P>
They were involved in terrorist acts in the governorates of
Minya, Beni Suef, Fayoum and Giza in the period between 1994 and
1996. The news agency did not say when they were arrested.
</P>
<P>
The accused are believed to be members of al-Gamaa al-Islamiya,
or the Islamic Group, which took up arms in 1992 in an attempt to
overthrow the secular government and install a strict Islamic
rule. More than 1,200 people, mostly police and Islamic militants
have been killed in the fightings.
</P>
<P>
Egypt usually slaps harsh punishment on the Islamic
extremists. If convicted, the defendants will face death penalty.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Inflation in 1999 to Reach 38-40 Percent: Central Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Central Bank
forecasts a 38-40 percent inflation for 1999 in the country, said
a top Russian financial official here this weekend.
</P>
<P>
Tatyana Paramonova, first deputy chairman of the Central Bank,
said at an international conference of the Russian-European Center
for Economic Policy that Russia's financial and monetary policy
must keep inflation below 18 percent next year.
</P>
<P>
"This is quite realistic," she said.
</P>
<P>
Paramonova said the government's short-term objective will be
to preserve foreign exchange reserves.
</P>
<P>
The floating rate policy allows the Central Bank to keep its
reserves at a fairly acceptable level, which is equivalent to the
value of Russia's three-month imports at present, she said. "This
is quite acceptable if it weren't for the fact that we have to pay
debts in the future as well," Paramonova said.
</P>
<P>
The foreign reserves in 2000 will remain at current level, she
added.

<HEADLINE> Weizman Asks Israelis to Back Talks With Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 12 (Xinhua)-- Israeli President Ezer
Weizman Sunday urged the Israeli people to support Israel's
upcoming peace talks with Syria, saying a peace treaty with Syria
can bring real peace to Israel.
</P>
<P>
The president also urged the residents at the Golan Heights to
face reality and be prepared for a peace deal with Syria, which
may mean the return of strategic plateau to Syria and their
re-settling.
</P>
<P>
Israel seized the Golan from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war
and annexed it in 1981. The peace talks between the two sides on
the Golan issue have been stalled since February 1996.
</P>
<P>
Weizman made the remark in an interview with the Israel Radio
while commenting on the recent Egyptian efforts that have brought
home two remains of Israeli soldiers killed during the 1967 Middle
War in Sinai.
</P>
<P>
To make peace with Syria requires Israel to pay a heavy price,
and all Israelis, including the Golan residents, should be
prepared for that, Weizman pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Weizman asked the residents at the Golan not to take actions
against the peace process with the Syrians. After a 45-month
freeze, Syria and Israel have agreed to resume their peace talks
next week in Washington to discuss Israel's withdrawal from the
Golan, water, security arrangement and bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The Residents Committee of the Golan Heights, supported by the
Jewish Settlement Council, has decided to launch its campaign
against the government's plan to hold peace talks with Syria for
fear that the government should return all the Golan back to the
Syrians.
</P>
<P>
The committee plans to organize a large demonstration on
Monday in Jerusalem to force Prime Minister Ehud Barak to change
his mind.
</P>
<P>
Most of Barak's coalition partners, including the right-wing
Shas, have decided to rally around the prime minister to move the
Israeli-Syrian peace talks forward.

<HEADLINE> Less Paper Office Advocated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Introducing a new study on Paper Cuts: Recovering the Paper
Landscape, the Institute promoted the concept of a "less-paper
office" against the backdrop of growing impact of paper on forests,
energy use, air and water pollution, and solid waste.
</P>
<P>
Global paper use has grown more than six-fold since 1950 with
one fifth of all wood harvested ending up in paper, the study
found.
</P>
<P>
Pulp and paper is the 5th largest industrial consumer of energy
in the world, using as much power to produce a ton of product as
the iron and steel industry, it said.
</P>
<P>
In some countries, including the United States, paper accounts
for nearly 40 percent of all municipal solid waste, it added.
</P>
<P>
Advocating the saving of paper use, the report said Bank of
America reduced its consumption of paper by 25 percent in just two
years with online reports and forms, email, double-sided copying,
and lighter-weight papers.
</P>
<P>
The bank also recycles 61 percent of its paper, saving about
half a million dollars a year in waste hauling fees.
</P>
<P>
This is against the figure of 57 percent of non-recycled paper
in the U.S., the Washington-based Institute said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The UK's companies are beating
their American counterparts in preparing to exploit the internet,
according to a new survey by Mori.
</P>
<P>
The survey, released Sunday by Intentia, the global software
group, confounds the general belief that Britain and Europe are
years behind the U.S. in their adoption of the internet.
</P>
<P>
Mori interviewed 700 directors in Europe and the U.S. on their
use of their internet and their predictions for future use.
</P>
<P>
British directors are forecasting that a higher proportion of
their sales will move onto the internet than their American
competitors.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that directors in Britain believe the web
will bring in 15 percent of all sales by 2001, equivalent to more
than 40 billion pounds. This is a higher proportion than in
America (14 percent) and continental Europe (12 percent).
</P>
<P>
It also showed that British boardrooms are the best prepared
when it comes to dealing with e-commerce. 95 percent of all
British boards have nominated one director to be responsible for e-
commerce compared with 91 percent in the U.S.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian, Syrian FMs Hold Talks on Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouq al-Sharaa held talks here Sunday with visiting Egyptian
Foreign Minister Amr Moussa on the latest developments of the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The talks followed the U.S. declaration on the resumption of
Syrian-Israeli peace talks next Wednesday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
After his talks with al-Sharaa, Moussa said the talks were very
important and underlined the necessity for Egyptian-Syrian
coordination in this particular stage of the history of the region.
</P>
<P>
He said he was looking forward to meeting Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad after his lengthy talks with Sharaa.
</P>
<P>
The talks with Sharaa dealt with bilateral issues as well as
issues related to the peace process, Moussa said, adding that he
would convey a message from Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to
Assad.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the seriousness of Israel in the peace talks,
Moussa said "I think the Syrian decision to resume the talks and
Sharaa's trip to Washington are evidence that Syria felt Israel's
seriousness."
</P>
<P>
On his view about the talks and the formation of the
negotiating teams, Moussa said "we attach great importance to the
coming round of talks that will be resumed from the point where
they left off. We are very serious in seeking peace in line with
U.N. Security Council resolutions."
</P>
<P>
The Syrian team is being formed and the list will be announced
Sunday evening or Monday, Moussa added.
</P>
<P>
"The Syrian-Israeli talks might move to Cairo if there was
desire to do so and it is natural that Egypt, a home for Syria,
may host the talks," Sharaa noted.
</P>
<P>
As for the talks between Israel and Lebanon, where Syria is an
power broker, Sharaa said the talks would be revived after the
coming Washington round of talks.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed belief that the Syrian and Lebanese tracks of
talks with Israel would be balanced, pointing out that
coordination between the neighbors was excellent.
</P>
<P>
He also voiced hope that the coming talks with Israel would
lead to a bilateral agreement on the Israeli withdrawal from South
Lebanon and the occupied Syrian Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Replying a question on the timetable and guarantees, Sharaa
said "I learned that U.S. President Bill Clinton expressed hope
that the talks would reach their target as soon as possible. We
hail such position and will try to achieve it."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Turkey Accepts EU's Candidacy Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- It was only after intense
shuttle diplomacy that Turkey overpassed early hesitancy and
finally accepted its long-awaited European Union (EU) offer of
candidacy for membership last Friday.
</P>
<P>
At first, Turkey did not respond positively to the offer
at the EU Helsinki summit. The country even signaled that it might
refuse the offer as it interpreted certain lines of the candidacy
draft approved by the summit as preconditions for membership.
</P>
<P>
The draft, sent to Ankara last Thursday before the announcement
of Turkey's candidacy, said EU candidates must either quickly
resolve all territorial disputes themselves or bring the issues
"within a reasonable time" to the International Court of Justice
in the Hague, clearly referring to Turko-Greek territorial
disputes in the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
The other cause, for which Turkey budged to accept the offer,
was the reference to Cyprus issue by the draft that stressed the
settlement of the dispute is not a precondition for Cyprus to
become an EU member.
</P>
<P>
The EU summit in Helsinki declared Turkey's candidacy early
Friday afternoon, and the candidacy text was then faxed to
Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit and Foreign Minister
Ismail Cem met with high-ranking officials and decided to express
Turkey's reservations to the offer.
</P>
<P>
Speculations that Turkey was not happy with the offer were
then rampant, promoting western leaders in lines to react.
</P>
<P>
Late Friday afternoon, U.S. President Bill Clinton called Ecevit
, urging Turkey to accept the offer. It was reported that Clinton
told Ecevit that the obstacles imposed were not so large that
they would be impossible to overcome.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Clinton's call, French President Jacques Chirac
phoned Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, trying to convince
the Turkish leader not to miss the opportunity that had been
presented.
</P>
<P>
Stressing full French support for Turkey's membership bid,
Chirac said the ball was in Turkey's court.
</P>
<P>
As the Turkish hesitancy to the offer lingered on, the EU
unprecedentedly decided to dispatch both the EU Foreign Policy
Chief Javier Solana and the EU Enlargement Commissioner Gunter
Verheugen to Ankara in a last-ditch effort to persuade Turkey to
agree with the EU's decision.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit, after meeting with Solana, announced Turkey's
acceptance of the EU offer and agreed to travel to Helsinki
Saturday to join leaders of twelve other applicants at a
landmark meeting with the fifteen current EU members.

<HEADLINE> Political Parties in Cyprus Cautious on EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot political parties have
been cautious toward the decision made by Helsinki summit of the
European Union to give Turkey candidate status in the pan-European
body.
</P>
<P>
Demetris Christofias, leader of the left-wing main opposition
AKEL party said his party is "not satisfied with the results."
</P>
<P>
He said the development proved that the Turkish Cypriot side
had only agreed to participate in proximity talks in New York to
help Turkey gain candidacy in Helsinki.
</P>
<P>
A parliamentary spokesman of AKEL expressed the concern that
the EU has not made what it expects from Turkey clear enough.
</P>
<P>
Democratic party's acting president Nicos Kleanthous said
Turkey should greet its nomination by contributing to progress
on the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-general of the socialist EDEK party Marinos
Sizopoulos said any comments on the decision have to be
carefully put and that his party will meet over the next
few days to form a final position.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for ruling Democratic Rally party said they will
be reserving their judgement until they receive the full text of
the Helsinki decision.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and then occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus applied for EU membership in 1990 and started
substantive accession negotiations with the EU in November
1998. It hopes to be admitted as an EU member by January 2003.
</P>
<P>
According to local newspapers, Turkish Premier Bulent Ecevit
Saturday said that the Turkish position on the Cyprus issue will
not change, and that the existence of two separate states on the
island is not up for debate.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Appreciates Greek Attitude at EU Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel on Sunday expressed satisfaction at Greece's position in
the just-concluded EU summit, which offered Turkey with candidacy
for the 15-member European bloc.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a TV program broadcast on the CNN-Turk channel,
Demirel said that "there was a detente between Turkey and Greece
before the EU Helsinki summit. If Greece had obstructed Turkey's
candidacy, this rapprochement would be destroyed."
</P>
<P>
Relations between Turkey and Greece, the two long-standing
rivals over Cyprus issue and the Aegean territorial waters, have
long been tense despite some reciprocal overtures to ease the
aftermath of the earthquakes that hit the two countries separately.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the EU summit in Helsinki, Finland, there was a strong
suspicion in Ankara that Greece might block Turkey's bid for
candidacy. However, it turned out to be otherwise.
</P>
<P>
"This positive atmosphere should be maintained between Turkey
and Greece. It will lead to better relations between the two
countries," Demirel said.
</P>
<P>
"We should trust each other to resolve disputes. We should
resolve all problems under the umbrella of mutual confidence," he
added.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether Greece will veto the EU's financial aid to
Turkey, Demirel said that "earthquake disasters have notably
brought Turkey and Greece closer. Foreign ministers of both
countries have strengthened this rapprochement. Press and business
circles have also made a considerable contribution to this
end."
</P>
<P>
He also stressed "this rapprochement does not mean solution of
long-standing problems just in one day. But it is a significant
development...This positive atmosphere should be maintained
between Turkey and Greece."
</P>
<P>
Turkey accepted the long-awaited EU candidacy offer at the
eleventh hour in the wake of a dramatic frenzy of meetings,
telephone exchanges and shuttle diplomacy.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Predicts Difficult Israeli-Syrian Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Emile
Lahoud Sunday predicted that the upcoming Israeli-Syrian talks
will be difficult.
</P>
<P>
"The latest development in the peace process is very
delicate rather than being easy. And the negotiaions will go
forward and backward," Lahoud told local guests.
</P>
<P>
Last Wednesday, the United States President Bill Clinton
announced that Israel and Syria have agreed to resume peace
negotiations "at the point where they left off" in 1996 and
the talks will start next Wednesday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Talks on the Syrian and Lebanese tracks have been suspended
since Israeli former hardline Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
came to power in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Lebanon wants a simultaneous Israeli withdrawal
from their Golan Heights and south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel captured the Syrian strategic plateau in the 1967
Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
It set up a self-styled security zone in south Lebanon in 1985
with the claimed aim of preventing cross-border attacks by
Lebanese guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud expressed hope that Israel and Syria will soon reach
a just and comprehensive peace agreement which will secure
the return of occupied Arab lands.

DAMASCUS, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister
Farouq al-Sharaa expressed hope Sunday that peace deals on the
Syrian and Lebanese tracks will be reached in the coming few
months.
</P>
<P>
Sharaa told reporters that "we hope that Syria and Lebanon
would be able to reach a peace deal with Israel as soon as
possible."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said 70 percent of
the issues on the agenda of the Israeli-Syrian talks have been
settled in indirect talks under the U.S. auspices and U.S.
President Bill Clinton's mediation.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to Washington with a good will and hope that the
talks would be successful," said Sharaa, adding "we are serious in
our pursuit of peace and will do our best to contribute to the
peace-making process."
</P>
<P>
Visiting Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told reporters
here on Sunday that the resumption of Syrian-Israeli direct talks
was a very important development. "We hope that we would be a
helping element in the talks besides Clinton," he added
</P>
<P>
Sharaa also expressed thanks to the U.S. for its efforts made
over the past few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and Secretary of State Madeline Albright played
significant roles in bringing out the resumption of the
Syrian-Israeli talks.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Clinton announced the coming resumption of
Syrian-Israeli peace talks, a day after Albright held lengthy
talks with Syrian President Hafez Al-Assad as part of her her
four-day tour to the region, which took her to Saudi Arabia,
Syria, Israel, Palestinian self-rule areas and Egypt.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) will increase its
investments in Russian economy in the nearest years to accelerate
the recovery of the country's economy, said EBRD President Horst
Kehler here recently.
</P>
<P>
He told journalists after a meeting with Russian Economy
Minister Andrei Shapovalyants last week that the volume of EBRD
investments in Russia in 1999 will amount to 180-190 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The sum may rise to 400-600 million dollars in 2000 and add up
to one billion dollars in 2003, he said.
</P>
<P>
The marked indices will depend on the improvement of the
investment climate in Russia, which is unfavorable for foreign
companies now, said Kehler.
</P>
<P>
The main problems which foreign investors come across in Russia
are the impossibility of predicting the normative base, state
interference and corruption, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he stressed, EBRD confirms its support to Russia.

<HEADLINE> 7 Killed in Road Accident in Egypt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Seven people were killed and six
others injured in a road accident in northern Egypt on Sunday, the
Interior Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a statement that the traffic accident took
place when a taxi tried to overtake a truck on the desert road
linking Cairo and the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria, 220
kilometers northwest of the capital.
</P>
<P>
The taxi driver lost control of his vehicle in the process and
collided with the truck while another truck immediately following
the taxi ran into it, Egypt's Middle East News Agency quoted the
statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
The injured have been rushed to hospitals and further
investigations into the incident are underway.
</P>
<P>
Road accidents are common in Egypt because of high speed and
failure to abide by traffic rules. Rural highways have been dubbed
"road of death" the by local media.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, an annual average of 5,000
people are killed in road accidents, which also cause about 1
billion U.S. dollars worth of economic loss.

<HEADLINE> IOC 110th Session Approves All Recommended Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The
International Olympic Committee (IOC) has overwhelmingly adopted
all 50 reforms proposed by the IOC 2000 reform commission.
</P>
<P>
During the extraordinary 110th session of the IOC in Lausanne
on December 11-12, IOC members approved major changes that will
result in a more open, responsive, and accountable organization,
including the elimination of member visits to bid cities, the
application of terms of office, and the addition of ten active
athletes to the IOC membership.
</P>
<P>
"In January we said we would reform; today we have delivered.
Tomorrow we begin to implement," said IOC President Juan Antonio
Samaranch. "I have called the Executive Board together tomorrow
morning to determine the next steps toward ensuring the spirit of
this reform becomes a lasting part of our culture."
</P>
<P>
Some reforms will have immediate effect, such as the election
of the active athletes; others will need up to three years, such
as reaching the target number of 115 members, to be fully
implemented. During this time, the number of members is expected
to grow above the 115 target.
</P>
<P>
The IOC members met in Lausanne to vote on the reforms and
finalize required amendments to the Olympic Charter needed to
implement these policy changes. The members of the IOC 2000 reform
commission and the IOC Ethics Commission were in attendance to
view the debate. The IOC 2000 reform commission has fulfilled its
task and ceased to exist after its recommendations were approved
by the IOC session.
</P>
<P>
To increase transparency, the two-day IOC session was open to
the media via closed-circuit television, as were the IOC 2000
plenary meetings and the 109th IOC session in Seoul last June.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Turkey Accepts EU's Candidacy Offer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- It was only after intense
shuttle diplomacy that Turkey overpassed early hesitancy and
finally accepted its long-awaited European Union (EU) offer of
candidacy for membership last Friday.
</P>
<P>
At first, Turkey did not respond positively to the offer
at the EU Helsinki summit. The country even signaled that it might
refuse the offer as it interpreted certain lines of the candidacy
draft approved by the summit as preconditions for membership.
</P>
<P>
The draft, sent to Ankara last Thursday before the announcement
of Turkey's candidacy, said EU candidates must either quickly
resolve all territorial disputes themselves or bring the issues
"within a reasonable time" to the International Court of Justice
in the Hague, clearly referring to Turko-Greek territorial
disputes in the Aegean Sea.
</P>
<P>
The other cause, for which Turkey budged to accept the offer,
was the reference to Cyprus issue by the draft that stressed the
settlement of the dispute is not a precondition for Cyprus to
become an EU member.
</P>
<P>
The EU summit in Helsinki declared Turkey's candidacy early
Friday afternoon, and the candidacy text was then faxed to
Ankara.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit and Foreign Minister
Ismail Cem met with high-ranking officials and decided to express
Turkey's reservations to the offer.
</P>
<P>
Speculations that Turkey was not happy with the offer were
then rampant, promoting western leaders in lines to react.
</P>
<P>
Late Friday afternoon, U.S. President Bill Clinton called Ecevit
, urging Turkey to accept the offer. It was reported that Clinton
told Ecevit that the obstacles imposed were not so large that
they would be impossible to overcome.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Clinton's call, French President Jacques Chirac
phoned Turkish President Suleyman Demirel, trying to convince
the Turkish leader not to miss the opportunity that had been
presented.
</P>
<P>
Stressing full French support for Turkey's membership bid,
Chirac said the ball was in Turkey's court.
</P>
<P>
As the Turkish hesitancy to the offer lingered on, the EU
unprecedentedly decided to dispatch both the EU Foreign Policy
Chief Javier Solana and the EU Enlargement Commissioner Gunter
Verheugen to Ankara in a last-ditch effort to persuade Turkey to
agree with the EU's decision.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit, after meeting with Solana, announced Turkey's
acceptance of the EU offer and agreed to travel to Helsinki
Saturday to join leaders of twelve other applicants at a
landmark meeting with the fifteen current EU members.

<P>
LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The
International Olympic Committee(IOC) elected 10 active athletes as
new members here Sunday as part of the organization's reforms.
</P>
<P>
The election of the 10 active athletes marked the first time
active athletes have become members of the IOC, said the
organization in a press release. The proposal was made by IOC
President Juan Antonio Samaranch.
</P>
<P>
With the election of the 10 active athletes, the IOC membership
now stands at 113. Eventually a total of 15 active athletes will
become full IOC members, according to the newly approved reforms.
</P>

During the extraordinary 110th session of the IOC in Lausanne

<HEADLINE> Palestinian-Israeli Talks to Be Resumed in Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb
Erekat said Sunday that the Palestinian and Israeli negotiators
will resume their talks Monday in Gaza on land transfer and more
Palestinian prisoners' release, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Erekat said the Israeli side has promised to free the third
batch Palestinian prisoners upon the return of Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak from his Washington talks with Syria, which
were scheduled for next Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As part of the latest Palestinian-Israeli peace deal, or the
Sharm el Sheikh Memorandum, Israel set free two batches of
Palestinian prisoners respectively on September 9 and October 15.
</P>
<P>
As a gesture of goodwill, Israel had agreed to release another
batch of Palestinian prisoners before the Muslim holy month of
Ramadan, which started Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
But the planned release was stalled at the eleventh hour
along with the ill-fated final-status talks on a parallel track.
</P>
<P>
At issue besides the prisoner issue is the delayed Israeli
second troops redeployment in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Israel should have delivered 5 percent more of the West Bank
land to partial or full Palestinian rule on November 15, with
another 6.1 percent land transfer on January 20 to complete the
three stages of Israeli troops withdrawal from the West Bank
mandated in the Sharm el Sheikh Memorandum.
</P>
<P>
But a dispute between the two sides over which lands should be
transferred has put the territory delivery on hold.

<HEADLINE> IOC Agrees to Create Improved Host City Election Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAUSANNE, SWITZERLAND, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The
International Olympic Committee (IOC) approved here Sunday reforms
to create an improved host city election process.
</P>
<P>
The IOC expressed hope that the new process would clarify both
the qualifications necessary to bid for the games and the
responsibilities and obligations of all parties involved in the
process.
</P>
<P>
The controversial ban of visits of IOC members to bid cities
was also accepted at the IOC's extraordinary 110th session held in
Lausanne on December 11-12.
</P>
<P>
Among the major changes of the host city selection process are:
</P>
<P>
-- The addition of a bid acceptance procedure that would review
the organizational capacity of the interested cities in order to
accept them as candidates;
</P>
<P>
-- The elimination of member visits to the candidate cities on
the basis of having the benefit of knowledge gained from a
strengthened Evaluation Commission. It should be noted the IOC
membership also would be able to rely on a bid acceptance process
that would bring forward only the candidates most qualified to
host the Games;
</P>
<P>
-- The strengthening of the obligations of the NOCs to oversee
and counsel the bidding committees in their countries;
</P>
<P>
-- The signing of a contract between the IOC, the bid cities,
and their NOCs outlining the obligations of each party, the
applicable code of conduct, and the sanctions for breach of the
terms.

WASHINGTON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- While the United States
publicly vowed not to keep nuclear weapons in Japan, it secretly
stored them on two Japanese islands occupied by the U.S. military
forces after World War II, and was prepared to do the same as many
as 11 other Japanese sites, the leading U.S. newspapers said on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The disclosure was made by William Arkin, a nuclear weapons
analyst, co-author of an article, which is to be published in the
January/February issue of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists,
according to newspapers the New York Times and the Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
The article says that between 1956 and 1966, the United States,
apparently with Japanese agreement, kept nuclear weapons without
their fissile cores on Chichi-jima, 500 miles southeast of the
Japanese mainland, and on Iwo jima, the scene of one of the
bloodiest battles in World War II.
</P>
<P>
The United States also kept nuclear weapons on Okinawa until
1972 when the American occupation ended, and also stored nuclear
bombs without their fissile cores on the island and on some other
islands.
</P>
<P>
The article uses the newly declassified documents to expose that
the United States has never made its deeds in accordance with its
words.
</P>
<P>
"Based on these documents, we now see for the first time a much
fuller picture of how Japan was integrated into the U.S. nuclear
system," Arkin said.
</P>
<P>
"The non-nuclear status of the country (Japan) was
fundamentally undermined," because of U.S. storage of nuclear
weapons there, Arkin added.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration refused to make any comment on the
disclosure.
</P>
<P>
"We don't dispute the authenticity of the documents," one
official said. "They are what they are. But we're not going to
comment on anything about what they say."

<HEADLINE> Toxic British Face Creams Smuggled Into S. Africa: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Toxic British
skin-bleaching creams are being smuggled into South Africa in a
multi-billion-rand underground industry which is disfiguring
thousands of women, a South African newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In an investigation, the Sunday Times found that the creams
made in Bolton, Manchester, Egham and London all contained the
chemical hydroquinone, which can cause irreparable skin damage and
has been banned for use in South Africa for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The British companies first sell their creams to agents in such
 countries as Zimbabwe, Zambia, Angola, Botswana and Kenya, the
paper said.
</P>
<P>
Then the agents employ syndicates to smuggle them into South
Africa -- hidden between goods on trucks, on the top of buses, in
car boots and suitcases.
</P>
<P>
The smugglers were taking advantage of the lack of control at
borders and harbors, Gavin Collinet, director of customs
operations for the South African Revenue Services, was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Medicines Control Council raided a cream
wholesale and distribution center in Johannesburg and confiscated
thousands of tubes of illegal face creams hidden in a basement.
At least 10 brands of the creams were made in Britain.

<P>
OTTAWA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian federal government
plans to spend up to 5 billion Canadian dollars (about 3.4 billion
U.S. dollars) getting its services online by 2004, the Ottawa
Citizen reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The cyberspace project aims at building new infrastructure and
putting the mounds of government information and programs on the
Web, the report quoted federal officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government departments would be able to use the Internet to
reengineer how they do business.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the paper-based transactions being conducted in those
departments, the high-cost technology would mean paperless one-
stop shopping for all federal, provincial and municipal government
services.
</P>
<P>
Canadians, for example, would be able to file income tax and
get the refund directly deposited into their account, without ever
knowing the transaction processed through Revenue Canada,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The government and technology industry have, in their first
step, worked closely over the past year to develop a secure, high-
speed network to deliver federal services over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
A total of 26 million Canadian dollars (about 18 million U.S.
dollars) has been set aside to develop a prototype of the network.

KATHMANDU, December 12 (Xinhua) -- With one more seat secured
in the Rautahat constituency, the ruling Nepali Congress (NC)
party bagged all three seats in the by-elections to the House of
Representatives, according to the counting result declared Sunday
by the Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
NC candidate Prakash Koirala won the Rautahat constituency seat
with an overwhelming 34,978 votes in the by-election that began
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
His closest rival from the main opposition party, the Communist
Party of Nepal-United Marxist and Leninist (CPN-UML), polled 18,
639 votes.
</P>
<P>
The by-election in Rautahat in central Nepal was prolonged by a
violent clash between police and armed villagers, during which one
person died and some others were injured.
</P>
<P>
According to the results announced Saturday by the Election
Commission, NC candidates won the two seats in Thursday's by-
elections in the Morang and Jhapa districts in eastern Nepal.
</P>
<P>
None of these three constituencies had an MP in the 205-seat
House of Representatives, as the seats were vacated by three
leaders of political parties who won simultaneously in two
constituencies in the last general election in May, 1999.

<HEADLINE> Telethon Fund-Raiser Breaks Donation Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 12 (Xinhua) -- A television marathon to raise
funds to combat muscular dystrophy and genetic diseases broke all
records here when it ended Sunday.
</P>
<P>
During the 32-hour show, the Telethon collected more than 40.4
billion lire (about 21.2 million U.S. dollars) in promised
donations, a rate of over 1.25 billion lire per hour.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Telethon raised a little over 37 billion lire (
about 19.4 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"The next challenge is to have, in three years time, a Noble
laureate installed in a new genetic research center that is to be
created in Naples in the year 2000," announced Susanna Agnelli,
chairman of the Telethon committee.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to its initiatives, Telethon is launching a new
generation of researchers in Italy.
</P>
<P>
Nobel laureate Renato Dulbecco pointed up the Telethon program
of
financial support over a five-year period to promising young
people who would be given training and a chance to do research in
Italian institutes and laboratories.
</P>
<P>
"In five years, a youth can demonstrate his (or her) abilities
and once the training period is over can continue with the project
either as a young researcher or as a professional with ten years
experience,"Dulbecco noted.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Iraq, U.N. Ties Prove Difficult in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Difficult relations with the
sanctions-hit Iraq have been a focus of contention for the United
Nations throughout 1999, with its Security Council still remaining
divided over its new omnibus policy toward Iraq.
</P>
<P>
It has been tough for the United Nations to handle with the
Iraqi issue ever since last December's four-night U.S. and British
airstrikes against the country for what the U.S. claimed Baghdad's
refusal to cooperate with the U.N. weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The air campaign resulted in Iraq's termination of U.N. arms
inspections in the country.
</P>
<P>
Parties involved have been locked in bitter rows and political
struggles over a new U.N. comprehensive policy on Iraq, though
behind-the-scene bargains and compromises were also reached from
time to time.
</P>
<P>
Over the past several months, the Security Council members,
especially the five permanent members of the council - Britain,
China, France, Russia and the U.S.- have been trying to adopt a
resolution for the resumption of the arms inspections in exchange
for a possible suspension of the sanctions imposed on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The draft resolution, initiated by Britain and the Netherlands,
proposed that the economic sanctions on Iraq be suspended for a
renewable period of 120 days if Baghdad "cooperates fully" with a
new U.N. supervisory authority of disarmament.
</P>
<P>
But the five permanent members are at odds over how long the
test period will be and how to evaluate Iraq's compliance with the
new U.N. inspection regime before the suspension materializes.
</P>
<P>
Russia, China and France, which are more sympathetic to Iraq,
favor suspending sanctions soon after Iraq allows U.N. weapons
inspectors to return and demonstrates compliance with them, while
the U.S. and Britain demand a longer waiting period and Iraqi
answers to outstanding questions about its disarmament.
</P>
<P>
The discussion and debate have accelerated recently and the
15-member council has decided to vote on the resolution Monday,
with the hope to shape a new policy toward Iraq by the year end.
</P>
<P>
But uncertainties still remain in place for the implementation
of the new policy even if it takes shape because Baghdad has
repeatedly declared that it will not accept any U.N. resolution
that falls short of total and unconditional lifting of the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz argues that "the
British draft lends credit to the fact that the Security Council
has obviously reneged on its reciprocal commitments toward Iraq
according to U.N. resolution 687 which stipulates lifting of the
embargo off Iraq without resorting to trammel Iraq with further
conditions."
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Mahammad Said al-Sahaf also affirmed that
there will be no "U" turn in its stand toward the British draft,
which he called "a malicious resolution that would only do Iraq
great harm."

<P>
In the duration of debates on the Iraqi issue at the Security
Council, the oil-for-food program between the U.N. and Iraq was
held hostage twice by the U.S. and Britain which were pressing
the council to move for a quick vote on the British proposal.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad was enraged in recent weeks by the council's two
shorter-than-usual extensions of the program, with one for two
weeks and the other only one week, and in a protest Iraq has
stopped oil export since November 22.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain had hoped to push for the adoption of the
British draft in the past weeks, but Russia, China and France
opposed any hasty moves in putting the draft on vote and stand for
further search for compromising wording in order to make the
comprehensive resolution's text acceptable to all.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain, which have been under huge pressure
and harsh criticism from the international community for
connecting the comprehensive policy on Iraq with the U.N.
humanitarian program, finally agreed to extend the program for
another sixth months on December 10.
</P>
<P>
The full six-month extension is just a rollover of the program
without any improvement demanded by the Iraqi government, which
allows Iraq to sell 5.2 billion U.S. dollars of oil in six months
to buy food, medicine and other infrastructure-related materials
for its people reeling under the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad in the year has repeatedly accused the U.S. and
British envoys at the U.N. Sanctions Committee of deliberately
impeding the approval of its contracts signed under the
oil-for-food deal and blocking the smooth implementation of the
humanitarian program.
</P>
<P>
The deteriorating humanitarian situation resulting from the
continuation of the sanctions was highlighted in a survey of the
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) which shows that Iraq's
child mortality rates have more than doubled since the imposition
of the crippling U.N. sanctions on Iraq in 1990.
</P>
<P>
The sufferings of the Iraqi people incurred mounting calls for
lifting the embargo on Iraq. Many governmental or
non-governmental organizations have urged for the removal of the
sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The most conspicuous move of all was made by British MP of the
ruling Labor Party George Galloway whose Mariam Appeal convoy
traveled three continents and 11 countries in two months to shed
light on the sufferings of the ordinary Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the year 1999, regular U.S.-British bombardment of
Iraqi targets, military and civilian, has become the most
visible symbol of U.S. engagement in the region. Their bombing
has caused huge civilian casualties and property damages.
</P>
<P>
The northern and southern no-fly zones in Iraq have become
the sites of almost daily skirmishes since last December's
U.S.-British bombardment of Iraqi targets.
</P>
<P>
Iraq does not recognize the no-fly zones, because they were
imposed without U.N. mandate and therefore "illegal," and its
troops have been firing at patrolling allied warplanes.
</P>
<P>
While the U.S. has declared that it will not scale back its
military presence in the Gulf, and will work for the overthrow of
the national government of Iraq led by President Saddam Hussein, a
defiant Saddam has also vowed that his country will never give in
to the U.S. and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Since the U.N. Security Council is intensifying its efforts to
reach an omnibus policy on Iraq, Iraq's attitude toward this
forthcoming U.N. policy will be very important to the development
of the situation.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's Foreign Undersecretary, former U.N. Ambassador, Nazar
Hamdoun recently has said "we cannot take both the sanctions and
the inspectors, one of them will have to go. Without removing the
sanctions entirely, it is impossible for us to deal with any
inspection activity."
</P>
<P>
And the possibility of a new crisis over the Iraqi issue
cannot be totally ruled out.

<HEADLINE> Barak: Israel has to Pay Price for Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 13 (Xinhua) -- To reach a peace agreement
with Syria means that Israel has to pay the price for the future,
said Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a special session of the Israeli Knesset
(parliament) held to discuss the government's decision to resume
peace talks with Syria, Barak also urged the public to support the
Israeli-Syrian negotiations, even though they will require
territorial concessions in the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Israeli President Ezer Weziman was also invited to attend the
special session, which will vote on whether to accept Barak's
statement on resumption of the Israeli-Syrian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
"If an agreement is reached with the Syrians, it is a
historical time. Our generations will pay the price for the
future and for future generations, for the end of wars and for
peace," Barak said.
</P>
<P>
"Everybody will benefit from the agreement, especially the
young generations, the soldiers of tomorrow, who will not be
called upon to shed their blood in battles," Barak said.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Barak called upon the Israeli people,
particularly the residents at the Golan Heights, to support the
government's policy on resuming peace talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Barak promised that his government will do everything possible
to reach the best agreement for Israel and will present it to the
people to decide.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Barak also said that the peace talks with
Syria will also help solve the issue of Israel's troops withdrawal
from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He said Israel's pullout from south Lebanon will end years of
tragedy in the north.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Barak said that the resumption of peace talks with
Syria will not affect the Israeli-Palestinian final-status talks,
saying the Israeli side will continue the talks aimed at reaching
a permanent settlement with the Palestinian as asked by the Sharm
El-Sheikh peace deal.
</P>
<P>
The deal stipulates that the two sides should reach a framework
agreement on final-status by next February and a final peace
agreement by September the same year.
</P>
<P>
Following Barak's speech, opposition party Likud party leader
took the floor, accusing Barak of deciding to resume peace talks
with Syria aimed at selling out Israel's national interests and
the residents of the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied the Golan Heights during the 1967 Middle East
War.
</P>
<P>
Barak will fly to Washington Tuesday to hold talks there with
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq Al-Sharaa on Wednesday and
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Council to Vote on New Resolution Towards Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council is expected to take action Monday on a new
comprehensive policy towards Iraq despite that the full members of
the Council have not reached consensus on it.
</P>
<P>
The vote has been pushed by the United States and Britain for
several days which seeks to restore the U.N. weapons inspection
regime at an earlier date for Iraq amid the concern that Iraq
might have taken advantage of the vacuum to revive its program of
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
It is uncertain what will be the result of the vote since some
members of the Council have expressed their dissatisfaction over
the draft, namely China, Russian and France, three of the five
permanent members of the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
The Council has been divided on its policy towards Iraq since
the U.S.-led military strikes against Iraq last December and Iraq
has barred the U.N. weapons inspectors from returning who withdraw
from the country days before the strikes.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has reiterated that it will not cooperate with the United
Nations until the sanctions get lifted. According relevant U.N.
resolution, Iraq must be free of the weapons of mass destruction
before the sanctions can be lifted.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has urged China, Russia and France to reject the draft
resolution, saying that it is filled with new restrictions and
unacceptable conditions.

<HEADLINE> Russian Federal Forces Closing in on Grozny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Russian federal troops took
control of the suburb and a nearby airport of Grozny Monday,
moving closer to capturing the capital city of the breakaway
republic.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the air force lost a Su-25 combat plane Monday but
the pilot ejected to safety. Federal forces have launched a search
and rescue operation for the pilot. According to unconfirmed
reports from Grozny, two helicopters trying to pick up the pilot
were shot down by Chechen fighters.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Defense Ministry confirmed the loss of the Su-25,
which was on a reconnaissance mission, but said it had crashed due
to a technical fault, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Vladimir Putin Monday,
the federal government's envoy to Chechnya, Nikolai Koshman, said
Grozny would be captured in six to 10 days.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said about 4,000 militants are
confronting Russian units in Chechnya, with a maximum of around 2,
000 in Grozny and about the same number holding up in the
mountains.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that there would be no frontal attack on Grozny
like that in the previous Chechen war of 1994-1996, when federal
forces suffered heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged the local population to oust the militants
from the city, just like what had happened in several other major
Chechen cities, such as Achkhoi-Martan, Gudermes and Argun.
</P>
<P>
"The Grozny issue will be settled by the local population
themselves. We will certainly help but what we will conduct there
will not be a large-scale operation with heavy casualties on both
sides," he said.
</P>
<P>
In another related development, the Russian State Duma, or
lower house of parliament, on Monday approved an amnesty of
Chechen militants "who have not been involved in any bloodshed in
this campaign."
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev welcomed the move, saying that there are quite a few
such men in Chechnya, especially in Grozny.
</P>
<P>
"All major gangsters have long since fled Grozny. Those who
have stayed there are 16-, 17- and 18-year-old boys. They need
help and we will provide it," Sergeyev said.
</P>
<P>
In other parts of Chechnya, Russian Eastern and Northern
military groups waged combat actions near the villages of Shali,
Avtury Novye Atagi and the Khankala railway station on Sunday,
Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Artillery pieces pounded militant gatherings outside the
villages of Kharachoi, Grushevoye, Dargo, Chadyri, Shali, Kiri,
Khankala Nefchi-Keloi, Prigornoye and Gikalovsky.
</P>
<P>
Federal aircraft continued their actions against the rebels,
flying 64 sorties on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Airstrikes were focused on the Argun gorge, and semi-
mountainous and mountainous areas, the federal headquarters said.
</P>
<P>
However, federal forces suspended its bombing of Grozny to
allow civilians to leave. Aircraft dropped fliers urging fighters
to turn in their arms, Interfax said.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Nature Releases List of Top Ten Imperiled Parks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian Nature Federation
has put 10 of the country's 39 parks on the list of the most
endangered.
</P>
<P>
The damaging list includes such spots as Alberta's Banff
National Park, British Columbia's Pacific Rim National Park and
New Brunswick's Fundy national Park, the Globe and Mail reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The country's influential daily newspaper quoted the Canadian
Nature as placing Prince Edward Island National Park on top of the
list, with Ontario's Point Pelee National Park ranking the second.
</P>
<P>
The imperilment was attributed to nearby logging and farming,
air and water pollution, as well as overtapping of the parks for
tourism.
</P>
<P>
The country's leading nature organization also showed in their
list that only Vuntut in Yukon remains pristine. Among rest of
others, four have minor impairments; 10 under significant threat;
18 facing major threats; four already severely harmed; two not yet
examined.
</P>
<P>
The warning list came after the federally appointed Panel on
Ecological Integrity announced in October that almost all Canada's
39 parks were in trouble.
</P>
<P>
The panel found that some of the parks set up as wildlife
preserves were actually losing indigenous species.
</P>
<P>
Alberta's Elk Island National Park, for instance, is completely
surrounded by a fence, the panel pointed out, adding that means
predators can't enter the park to eat bison and elk.
</P>
<P>
That in turn means Parks Canada has to sell off some of those
grazing animals to keep them from ruining plant life, according to
the panel.
</P>
<P>
The panel urged Canadians to look beyond the parks' pretty
surfaces and see the ecological wounds underneath.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Govt Troops Recapture Border Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government troops
have recaptured the southern strategic border town of Calai,
making a great progress in closing off the UNITA rebels from all
traffic to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan news agency ANGOP said Monday the rebels of the
National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) led by
Jonas Savimbi suffered "considerable" casualties and lost diverse
war materials during the fighting for the town.
</P>
<P>
It added that the Armed Forces of Angola will continue the
military actions against the rebels loyal to Savimbi until the
total destruction of the war machinery controlled by the rebel
leader.
</P>
<P>
Calai is a strategic town on the common frontiers between
Angola and Namibia, 120 kilometers east to the city of Cuangar,
another fortress in the border areas which has been recovered by
the government troops during the all-out offensive launched by the
government from September to October this year.
</P>
<P>
At this moment, the rebels have been driven into forest areas
in central Angola, while the government troops are closing in on
their enemies and setting blockade around the areas for preventing
the rebels from getting supplies from other countries.

<HEADLINE> Sudan's Capital Calm Under State of Emergency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The situation in the Sudan's
capital Khartoum remained calm after President Omar al-Bashir
Sunday night declared a state of emergency nationwide and
dissolved the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Bashir announced the presidential decrees in a televised speech
at 11:00 p.m. (2100 GMT) Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"In order to preserve the unity of the country and its
coherence, we declare a state of emergency in all parts of the
country and for a period of three months," Bashir said.
</P>
<P>
He said emergency laws take effect on Monday and the general
election authority would set a date for new parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
Following the declaration, government officials and the ruling
National Congress Party (NCP) leaders staged small gatherings in
front of the Republican Palace, al-Shahid Zubeir Center and the
Presidential Residence and Bashir attended several sittings to
explain his decisions.
</P>
<P>
Some supporters of Hassan al Turabi, speaker of the National
Assembly (parliament) gathered at his residence in the Khartoum
suburbs Sunday night, vowing to file a lawsuit against the
presidential decrees, arguing the president had no authority to
announce a state of emergency or dissolve the parliament.
</P>
<P>
But reports said that life of most citizens goes undisturbed.
Early Monday, Muslim citizens were seen head as usual for their
Dawn Prayers in the fasting month of Ramadan and workers carry on
their work, although security check in some strategic points was
tightened.
</P>
<P>
Bashir's moves were apparently set off by his recent discord
with the powerful speaker Turabi, who is NCP secretary-general as
well.
</P>
<P>
The parliament had been expected to vote on constitutional
amendments on Tuesday that would drastically reduce the
president's powers, despite Bashir's objection to the legislation.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the most sensitive article in the legislation was
that the president can be impeached by the parliament with a
two-thirds majority.
</P>
<P>
The current developments have put the war-torn Sudan at
crossroads, where a 16-year-old civil war and ensuing famine have
claimed nearly 2 million lives in the poor African state.

<HEADLINE> Russia Rejects NATO Accusations on Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Russia Monday rejected as
totally unacceptable NATO Supreme Commander-in-Chief in Europe
Wesley Clarke's accusations that Russian forces "indiscriminately"
destroy civilian targets and kill civilians in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"The anti-terrorist operation in Chechnya is well-known to
pursue the goal of destroying criminal gangs and is designed to
minimize the harm done to the civilian population and
infrastructure," the Russian Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
"What is surprising is that it is Clarke, one of the chief
perpetrators of the NATO aggression against the Federal Republic
of Yugoslavia (FRY), who is making anti-Russian statements this
time," the Interfax quoted the ministry's Information and Press
Department as saying.
</P>
<P>
The department said in a statement it was on Clarke's orders
that NATO's combat planes "methodically" destroyed economic and
civilian targets inside the FYR and its population, and even
members of international mass media working in Yugoslavia at that
time were declared legitimate targets.
</P>
<P>
"Statements made by this man that European nations do not
regard sovereignty as something unbreakable sound especially
threatening," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It added that Clarke seemed to attempt to make people forget
his recent "exploits" in Yugoslavia by accusing Russia of its
operation in Chechnya.

In a Finnish presidential statement released here, the EU made
a solemn appeal to the parties concerned to show restraint and to
refrain from action that might further damage the relations

The EU has urged both governments to make every effort to

It firmly supports the participation of the Organization of

"The EU is particularly worried that tensions, if not solved by
negotiations, may put into jeopardy the important achievements
made in the political and economic integration in the Central
American region.

<P>
The EU is urging both governments to concentrate on the
reconstruction and development of the disputed region -- the area
of the continental shelf beneath the Caribbean Sea after the
ratification of the Ramirez-Lopez Treaty on Maritime Delimitation
between Colombia and Honduras -- in line with the declaration
adopted by the Stockholm Consultative Group Meeting on May," the

<HEADLINE> Philippine Senate Approves Budget Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Senate
unanimously agreed Monday to trim the government's 2000
appropriations to 599 billion pesos (15 billion U.S. dollars) from
the House-approved 651-billion-peso (16.3 billion dollars) budget.
</P>
<P>
In their version of the proposed national budget, senators
agreed to restore 8 billion pesos (200 million U.S. dollars) of
the recommended 60-billion-peso (1.5 billion dollars) cut made by
finance committee chairman Senator John Osmena.
</P>
<P>
Osmena said he expects a possible deadlock in the bicameral
conference committee over his proposed cuts.
</P>
<P>
Senate President Blas Ople said the government would likely
negotiate for the restoration of some of the budget cuts which
senators maintain were necessary due to inflated revenue
projections for next year.
</P>
<P>
"The Presidential Palace will engage in summit diplomacy to
break the deadlock," Ople said, but added: "The senate will stand
firm on the cuts."
</P>
<P>
Senator Juan Ponce Enrile, for his part, remained optimistic
that the upper and lower houses would "find a common ground to
agree" to break whatever impasse might result.
</P>
<P>
Senators believe that the budget bill passed by the House of
Representatives, if adopted without cuts, would result in an
intolerable deficit.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Union of Local Authorities of the Philippines
has started a signature campaign to call for the restoration of
the proposed 30-billion-peso (750 million dollars) cut on the
internal revenue allotment of local government units.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said early Monday that the
government will accept cuts by Congress in the budget, but
stressed that any reduction should be minimal and should keep the
budget figure higher than the amount appropriated last year.
</P>
<P>
The final version of the budget is expected to be submitted to
President Joseph Estrada anytime this week, the signing of which
largely depends on how big is the cut.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Efforts to Reduce Africa's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will initiate moves
towards enhancing social and economic cooperation among African
countries to reduce over-dependence on Western countries for
economic growth, The Punch newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The moves are to whittle down the overbearing influence of the
United States and some member nations of the European Union (EU)
in the world's financial institutions which have reduced most
African nations to beggar nations, a source from Nigeria's Foreign
Ministry was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to the unidentified official, a Nigerian delegation
led by Foreign Minister Sule Lamido will make Nigeria's initiative
at a conference on security, stability, development and
cooperation in Africa to be held in Tanzania on December 17-20.
</P>
<P>
"The new initiative is to make African countries come together
in all areas, even the military," the official said, adding that
"we can have African High Command like the U.N. peace-keeping
force to help check crises in the continent."
</P>
<P>
The Organization of African Unity (OAU) had ratified the
conference on its agenda and given a legal backing to it as the
major integrating point for African countries, according to the
official.
</P>
<P>
The Kampala Document was adopted in 1991 by the Africa
Leadership Forum in conjunction with the OAU and U.N. Economic
Commission for Africa.
</P>
<P>
It stipulated that "the security and stability of each African
country was inseparably linked with the security of all African
countries" and " Africa cannot make any significant progress on
any other front without creating collectively a lasting solution
to its problems of security and stability."

<HEADLINE> 1 Killed, 30 Injured in Strike in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- One police constable was killed
and at least 30 people were injured on Monday in the Bangladeshi
capital of Dhaka during a nine-hour countrywide hartal (
destructive strike) called by the opposition alliance.
</P>
<P>
The police constable, who was seriously injured in a bomb blast
in Mirpur in the northern part of the capital during the strike
hours, died after being rushed to the combined military hospital,
reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
At least 30 people were injured mainly in bomb blasts during
the strike hours and in a clash between activists of the ruling
Awami League and the Jamaat-e-Islami, one component of the four-
party opposition alliance, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Some 6,000 security forces were deployed in Dhaka to maintain
law and order during the hartal, and 17 opposition activists were
arrested by police.
</P>
<P>
The AL and its front organizations organized anti-hartal
processions in the city, chanting slogans describing the
opposition's hartal program as "anti-people, destructive and based
on flimsy ground," the officials BSS news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The opposition sponsored the shutdown throughout the country to
press their demand for cancellation of the Chittagong City
Corporation election schedule. The Election Commission announced
early this month that polls to the city corporation would be held
in on January 3, 2000, and fixed the date for submission of
nomination papers on December 13.
</P>
<P>
The opposition originally planned a 10-hour hartal, but later
reduced it to nine hours to facilitate the fasting people.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties are also staging a 36-hour stoppage in
Chittagong, southeast Bangladesh, to resist the submission of
nomination papers of the polls on Monday. Reports said 15
journalist were injured in the seaport city on Monday during a
public meeting of the opposition alliance.
</P>
<P>
This is the first strike program in the month of Ramadan since
the AL came to power in 1996 and the second this month following
the opposition summit in late November.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Elections Free and Fair: EU Observers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's joint
Observer Mission in Mozambique described the elections in the
southern African country on December 3-5 as free and fair, the
Mozambique News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Polling has been conducted in a free and fair manner, allowing
the Mozambican people to express their will," head of the EU
mission Pertti Paasio said when presenting a preliminary report
from the 64 observers at a press conference in Maputo Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The EU observers unanimously concluded that the Mozambican
elections were "second to none" of all the elections they had ever
observed.
</P>
<P>
They held that problems and irregularities that occurred during
the general elections "are of such a minor scale that they do not
in any way invalidate the outcome of the polls".
</P>
<P>
The observers expressed the belief that guarantee of
transparency in the provincial count and tabulation of the results
"is a new facility that allows party agents and observers to view
results on a computer monitor."
</P>
<P>
The EU team found that staff were careful to avoid any
impression of bias, and thought that at times this led them not to
give sufficient explanation to voters as to how to mark the ballot
papers.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Senate Agrees to Open Retail Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Senate approved
Monday on third reading the government-backed Trade Liberalization
Bill which seeks to open up the local retail trade industry to
foreign retailers.
</P>
<P>
The bill would effectively repeal the country's Retail Trade
Nationalization Law that exclusively reserved the retail business
to Filipinos.
</P>
<P>
Under the approved measure, foreigners would be allowed to
fully own a retail business in the country provided that they
could come up with at least 100 million pesos (2.5 million U.S.
dollars) in paid-up capital.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors would have to shell out the full amount
within two years from the law's effectivity since partial foreign
ownership will not be allowed in the first two years.
</P>
<P>
Foreign retailers entering the country two years after the
effectivity of the law would be allowed not more than 60 percent
equity in retail enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The capital ceiling would apply to the whole corporation and
not on a per branch basis, as proposed earlier by the Department
of Trade and Industry.
</P>
<P>
The final version retained a number of other provisions in the
original, among which is the 50-million-dollar paid-up capital
requirement in the foreign retailer's parent corporation.
</P>
<P>
Foreign retailers must also have at least a five-year track
record as well as five retail branches or franchises anywhere in
the world.
</P>
<P>
The bill defines retail trade as "any act, occupation or
calling of habitually selling direct to the general public
merchandise, commodities or goods for consumption."

<HEADLINE> Vice Premier Urges Reform of China's Agricultural Structure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier Wen Jiabao
has called for further efforts to restructure the country's
agriculture and develop rural economy.
</P>
<P>
"China's agriculture and rural economy has entered a new
developmental stage," he said, adding that it is of the utmost
importance to develop high-efficiency agriculture, protect the
initiative of farmers and raise their income.
</P>
<P>
During an inspection tour of Hainan Province from December 9 to
12, Wen stressed that more efforts are needed to improve the
popularization of high-quality grain seeds and develop animal
husbandry and fishery in Hainan.
</P>
<P>
"Varieties of grain should be diversified and grain production
should not only concentrate on producing a high output but also
quality that will meet market demands," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wen also stressed the importance of agricultural infrastructure
and the improvement of ecology, saying that more investment should
be injected into water conservancy construction, afforestation,
improving highways, electricity networks, water supply and
telecommunications in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Wen also urged greater efforts for increasing farmers' income
by restructuring agriculture and improving circulation of
agricultural products.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Govt Not to Weaken Opposition: Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The ruling People's Liberation
Movement of Angola (MPLA) said Monday that the Angolan government
"will not weaken the opposition."
</P>
<P>
Joao Lourenco, secretary-general of the ruling party, said that
the current military campaign launched by the government troops is
not designed to combat the civilian opposition but to totally
destruct the illegal army controlled by Jonas Savimbi, head of the
National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
This fact can dismount any campaigns on purpose to accuse the
MPLA of trying to go back to one-party system and overlie the
opposition, Lourenco said in Kuito at a ceremony marking the 43rd
anniversary of the establishment of the party.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the power of the opposition parties can be
measured by their capacity of argument and mobilization of party
members, not by the number of their arms.
</P>
<P>
Lourenco reiterated his party's determination of continuing to
implement the 1994 Lusaka Protocol, citing the example of the
existence of the opposition members in the government departments,
parliament, armed forces and national police.
</P>
<P>
The ruling party leader noted that "the opposition has much
space for their function, which is not impeded by the government."
</P>
<P>
The opposition did less because it didn't want to do, he added.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani Economy Remains Sluggish: Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The State Bank of Pakistan (
SBP) said on Monday Pakistan's economy is still sluggish and
urgent corrective measures are needed for the rehabilitation of
the ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
A report by the bank, to be released Tuesday, blamed the
government of deposed prime minister Nawaz Sharif for the crisis.
</P>
<P>
During the 1998-99 fiscal year (July 1-June 30), the Gross
Domestic Product grew only by 3.1 percent against the target of
six percent, and agriculture growth was negligible by 0.4 percent,
said the report.
</P>
<P>
"The year turned out to be a difficult year. Both exogenous
factors as well as domestic policy management lapses contributed
to the harsh economic outcome," said the report.
</P>
<P>
It added that the year, which was termed bad and difficult, was
faced with a suspension of debt servicing, a cut in imports and
pressure on the exchange rate of the Pakistani rupee.
</P>
<P>
A freezing of foreign currency accounts in the wake of nuclear
tests in May last year had shaken the confidence of local and
foreign investors and the capitalization of stock markets reduced
by half, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, a rescheduling of the foreign debts by the Paris and
London clubs had helped Pakistan to avert default.
</P>
<P>
During the 1998-99 fiscal year, inflation in Pakistan was
further curtailed to 5.7 percent and the budget deficit was
lowered to 4.3 percent against 5.6 percent in the previous fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange reserves of Pakistan at one time had gone
down to an alarming level of 415 million U.S. dollars but later
picked up and reached 1.73 billion dollars. The balance of payment
position remained under pressure, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The SBP recommended quick policy measures to make the economy
sustainable by introducing structural changes in the fiscal policy,
a reduction in the budget deficit, debts servicing, increases in
exports, attracting external resources towards Pakistan,
population control and human resources development.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Golan Pullback Needs 20 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Israel will ask the United
States for early 20 billion U.S. dollars in defense aid to
implement a peace treaty with Syria and withdraw the defense
forces from the Golan Heights, according to preliminary unofficial
assessments made by Israeli defense establishments.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli defense establishments began to discuss their
budget requirements for withdrawal from the Golan again shortly
after last week's announcement of the resumption of the
Israeli-Syrian peace talks, Israeli defense officials told local
media Monday.
</P>
<P>
But they believe that Israel will have a very difficult time
persuading the United States to grant it such a large amount in
aid, even if it is a one-time grant, they said.
</P>
<P>
Israel's required defense aid package include 10 billion
dollars for the process of withdrawing from the highlands and
redeploying the defense forces, and another 10 billion to build
the "army of peace" involving the purchase of advanced combat and
intelligence equipment, which will help the Israel Defense Force
(IDF) execute major missions after the evacuation.
</P>
<P>
The IDF is in a view that it will have no problem evacuating
the camps on the Golan which Israel captured from Syria in the
1967 Arab-Israeli war, within three years if the needed funds are
available.
</P>
<P>
The assessments concerning the funds that will be required to
build the "army of peace" were worked out in 1995 and presented to
the United States during one of the rounds of talks between Israel
and Syria.
</P>
<P>
The resumption of peace talks with Syria is delaying a final
discussion of the IDF's plan for pulling out from south Lebanon,
but this issue has now become slightly less urgent, as the renewal
of the talks with Syria makes it likely that the pullout from
Lebanon will be part of a larger settlement, requiring less
preparation than a unilateral withdrawal, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is going to meet Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouq Al-Sharaa in Washington Wednesday and
Thursday to discuss the resumption of peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Barak Briefs Cabinet on Planned Talks With Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Israel will conduct its
peace talks with Syria on the basis of the United Nations Security
Council resolutions 242 and 338, said Prime Minister Ehud Barak
here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Briefing his cabinet on the decision to resume the peace talks
with Syria, Barak said the talks will be started from the points
where they have been left off in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Although Barak did not go into details about what the points
are, he assured that the talks will proceed on the basis of what
has been discussed and what has been achieved by the former Labor
government's peace talks with Syria till early 1996. This was also
Syria's condition for resuming the peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
But Barak told his cabinet ministers that in the process of the
peace talks with Syria, Israel will neither accept any
preconditions for moving the talks forward nor make any promise
to the Syrians.
</P>
<P>
As announced by U.S. President Bill Clinton, Barak will fly to
Washington Tuesday to hold talks there with Syrian Foreign
Minister Farouq al-Sharaa Wednesday and Thursday to discuss the
resumption of the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Terming the resumption of the talks as a positive development
in the Middle East peace process, Barak said the talks will not be
so easy because the two sides have to solve the thorny issues such
as the Golan Heights and security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Israel occupied the Golan Heights during the 1967 Middle East
war. Its ring-wing political parties and groups as well as
residents at Golan are against a full return of the highlands.
</P>
<P>
If the talks produce positive results, Barak said, the
Israeli-Lebanese peace talks on withdrawing Israeli troops from
south Lebanon can also be started soon and these two tracks of
peace-making can move ahead simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
He urged all cabinet ministers to support the resumption of
peace talks with Syria, saying achieving peace with Syria will
also help the whole Middle East realize lasting, durable and
comprehensive peace which the peoples in the region desire for.
</P>
<P>
This was the first cabinet meeting Barak held since the
announcement last Wednesday of the planned Washington meeting.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to make a statement on this issue to the
Knesset (parliament) Monday afternoon before flying to
Washington.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Four African countries have
implored the United Nations Security Council to assume full
responsibility of the peace process in the DRC, the Zimbabwean
News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Namibia, Zimbabwe
and Angola made the request at a one-day summit in the Namibian
capital Windhoek Sunday, which was designed to review the present
status of the implementation of the Lusaka cease-fire agreement
for the DRC.
</P>
<P>
Namibian President Sam Nujoma, Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe, President of the DRC Laurent Kabila and Angolan National
Defense Minister Kundi Paihama attended the summit.
</P>
<P>
The leaders welcomed in a communique the appointment of a
special representative of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan and
the deployment of U. N. military liaison officers in the capitals
of the parties to the cease- fire agreement.
</P>
<P>
But they said that U.N. should authorize an early deployment of
the U.N. peace-keeping forces to expedite the implementation of
the cease-fire agreement signed by all the parties directly
involved in the DRC conflict in July this year.
</P>
<P>
They also welcomed the deployment of military observers from
the Organization of the African Unity (OAU) in the vast central
African country.
</P>
<P>
The summit said that although significant progress had been
made since the signing of the cease-fire, there had been
violations, particularly in the areas of Ikela and Basankusu, by
Rwandan and Ugandan sponsored rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
The leaders at the summit reiterated their countries'
commitment to scrupulously observe the cease-fire agreement and
speed up the peace process in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
They also expressed the hope that other parties would adhere to
the letter and spirit of the Lusaka agreement.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, Namibia and Angola sent their troops to the DRC to
support Kabila to fight against the rebels backed by Uganda and
Rwanda.

<HEADLINE> Israel to Release Palestinian Prisoners Tuesday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Israel has agreed to release the
third batch of Palestinian prisoners Tuesday, said senior
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement broadcast by the Voice of Palestine radio Monday
morning, Erekat said the new session of the final-status talks
would be held next Sunday to discuss the second and third phases
of Israeli troop withdrawal from a total of 11.5 percent of the
West Bank territory under the Sharm el Sheikh memorandum signed
last September.
</P>
<P>
As part of the Sharm el Sheikh peace deal, Israel released 350
Palestinian prisoners on September 9 and October 15.
</P>
<P>
In a good-will gesture, Israel had agreed to release another
batch of Palestinian prisoners before the Muslim holy month of
Ramadan which started last Wednesday, in order to let them spend
the holy fasting month with their families.
</P>
<P>
But the release was stalled along with the final-status talks
which hit an impasse last Monday due to Israel's settlement
expansion in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Erekat criticized the Israeli side for continuously delaying
the withdrawal. And no date has been fixed for the supervision
committee meeting in charge of the third phase of the withdrawal,
said the Palestinian official.
</P>
<P>
He also blasted the United States for failing to honor its
commitments to the Sharm el Sheikh memorandum. He said that U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright had refused during her
regional tour last week to interfere in the issues of Jewish
settlement and Israeli troop withdrawal.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll Rises to 6 in Earthquake in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The death toll in Sunday's
earthquake in the northern Philippines rose to six as three more
fatalities were reported to the National Disaster Coordinating
Council(NDCC) on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The NDCC also said 37 were listed injured by Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
It said in a report that the latest fatalities came from
Pangasinan province. All the three died from heart attack when the
powerful 6.8 tremor struck at 2:03 a.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (
Philvocs)said the epicenter of the quake was 61 kilometers west of
Lingayen, Pangasinan Province and 195 after shocks have been
recorded after the main quake.
</P>
<P>
The NDCC said most of the 37 injured are from Pangasinan and
Zambales provinces.
</P>
<P>
The earthquake was the most powerful to hit Luzon since the
devastating 7.8 intensity temblor on July 16, 1990, which killed
about 2,000 people and injuring thousands.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Orlando Mercado of the Department of National Defense
(DND said Monday that efforts by the government to undertake the
disaster prevention and preparedness program has paid off, as
shown by the minimal damage to life and property during the strong
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that we move on from a culture of disaster
response to disaster preparedness," Mercado said in a radio
interview.
</P>
<P>
Three months ago, the government called for regular fire and
earthquake drills and a continuing inspection of structures
following a predawn quake that hit Taiwan on September 21.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, Mercado said, a team of structural engineers
from the private sector and the Armed Forces of the Philippines
continues to assess possible earthquake damage to structures in
Luzon.
</P>
<P>
But Mercado also reminded local government officials of their
duty to make sure public structures are safe and can withstand
future calamities.

<P>
The protest came after the reception of Osman Ferzauli in
Helsinki Saturday by Rene Nuberg, chief of the Finnish Foreign
Ministry's East Division, the Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Such an act is viewed in Russia as an attempt at interference
in its internal affairs, actual aiding and abetting Chechen
separatists and terrorists," Tass quoted a Russian Foreign
Ministry official as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The acts of Finnish authorities contradict the spirit of
Russian-Finnish good-neighborliness, and cannot help the positive
development of our bilateral relations," the official said.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian side is awaiting explanations from the Finnish
side and assurances that this kind of unfriendly activity toward
Russia can be prevented in the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ferzauli arrived in Helsinki last Friday from Denmark, where he
resides. He claimed that he was commissioned by Chechen President
Aslan Maskhadov to meet with members of the Finnish government,
Tass said.
</P>
<P>
Russia is in the middle of a military campaign against rebels
in Chechnya. The West has exerted mounting pressure on Moscow to
ease the assaults, but Russia defends its actions as a struggle
against bandits and terrorists roaming Chechnya.

<P>
HONG KONG, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's trade is poised
for a strong rebound in the year 2000, Executive Director of the
Trade Development Council (TDC) Michael C.C. Sze said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The TDC forecasts that total trade will grow by 7 percent in
value terms next year.
</P>
<P>
Total exports are expected to grow by 6 percent, led by an 8
percent increase in re-exports while imports are expected to
increase by 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's domestic exports, which are steadily decreasing,
would nonetheless drop at a slower rate of 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Sze said China's pending accession to the World Trade
Organization (WTO) presented the single-biggest opportunity in 20
years for Hong Kong's manufacturers, traders and service providers.
</P>
<P>
"A key priority for TDC in the coming year is to analyze the
full implications of China's WTO accession, sector by sector, in
the context of Hong Kong's strengths," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We want to make sure our clients, especially Hong Kong's small
and medium-sized enterprises, are well informed about what China's
further opening means for their business," Sze said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to releasing detailed research studies on
opportunities arising from China's WTO entry, the TDC would
partner with mainland entities to organize business seminars to
help companies in Hong Kong build new strategies around China's
WTO accession.

<HEADLINE> Major Oil, Gas Discovery in Nigeria's Deep Waters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Esso Exploration and Production
Nigeria Ltd. has made a major oil and gas discovery in its
offshore deep water block located some 165 kilometers southeast
off the coast of Lagos.
</P>
<P>
The company, a subsidiary of the American ExxonMobil
Corporation, said that the drilling in the appraisal well
encountered an oil bearing reservoir which flowed at the rate of
2,800 barrels per day from the test interval, This Day newspaper
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The discovery well was drilled from December 1998 to February
1999 while the appraisal well started in September this year and
was drilled to the depth of 3,745 meters.
</P>
<P>
Esso's discovery is the second one made in Nigeria's deep
waters. The first was made by SNEPCO, Shell's deep water
subsidiary, in its Bongha field lying 1,000 meters of water.
</P>
<P>
The Bongha field, which is believed to hold over one billion
barrels in proven reserves of crude oil, will be one of the
projects the Shell intends to invest part of its 10-billion-U.S.
dollar investment plan for Nigeria in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's deep waters hold the key to meeting the country's set
target to increase daily crude oil output to four million barrels
per day and reserves to 40 billion barrels by year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Multinationals operating in the west African country have
already spent an estimated 1.3 billion dollars on exploration and
appraisal work on their blocks between 1993 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
So far, a total of 33 exploration and appraisal wells have been
drilled since 1993 with 2D seismic work carried out in 21,000
square kilometers in the region along Nigeria's coast.

<HEADLINE> Russia Ratifies Union Treaty With Belarus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Russian State Duma ratified
the Russia-Belarus Union Treaty by an overwhelming majority at its
extraordinary session Monday.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, which was signed by Russian President Boris Yeltsin
and Belarus President Alexander Lukashenko last Wednesday, was
approved in the lower house of parliament by a vote of 382-2 with
three abstentions, the Interfax news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Lukashenko also inked an implementation program for
the treaty during the ceremony in the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
Observers say the treaty is the beginning of an integration
process between the two former Soviet republics, but a union state
will not emerge immediately in a complete form.
</P>
<P>
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, in presenting the treaty
to the State Duma, hailed December 8, the signing day of the
treaty, as the beginning of a new era and a turning point in the
history of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS).
</P>
<P>
CIS groups all the former Soviet republics except three Baltic
states -- Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
Although realistic integration mechanisms are yet to be worked
out, Russia and Belarus are prepared to enter the 21st century
together, Putin said.
</P>
<P>
He added that a joint budget and single emission center would
promptly be set up.
</P>
<P>
"We will have to work hard to resolve economic and political
problems and we also expect some help from the parliament ," Putin
told the lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Belarus will retain their respective Constitutional
orders. Russia's internal republics "would only benefit from the
creation of a Russian-Belarus Union," the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
To make the union state work, the two sides still have to
achieve a merger in " customs, budget and foreign policy," Putin
said.
</P>
<P>
He warned of numerous difficulties in "economic and legal
integration" while promised to defend Russia's interests in the
process.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Bans Import of Single-Pack Disposable  Syringes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
banned the import of single-pack disposable syringes to reduce the
risk of patients being contaminated by infectious diseases, the
official BSS news agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The single-pack syringes are being sold at random in the market,
and used syringes are being collected by some dishonest traders
who could process them at low cost and then resell in the market
at the risk of patients being contaminated by infectious diseases,
the news agency quoted Drug Administration sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
And some unscrupulous traders are indulged in importing used
single-pack syringes in bulk quantity which might contain germs of
various deadly disease and later sell them in the local market.
</P>
<P>
Quoting Commerce Ministry sources, the BSS said that after
further amending the Import and Export (Control) Act 1950, the
government will allow import of only "blister" and "ribbon" pack
syringes if the syringes fulfill the conditions laid down in
relevant clauses in the Import Policy Act 1999-2002.
</P>
<P>
Necessary measures would be taken against misuse of disposable
syringes by banning sale of single-pack syringes and strict
enforcement of mandatory use of blister and ribbon pack syringes,
the source said.
</P>
<P>
The cost of making blister and ribbon pack syringes is high
which could help prevent the reuse of the single-pack syringes,
according to the BSS.
</P>
<P>
The Drug Administration has imposed restriction on selling
single-pack syringes in the market, but as the item was included
in the import list, it was inconvenient for the administration to
effectively and strictly enforce the restriction, the BSS added.

<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, December 13 (Xinhua) -- A five-year Sino-British
program to develop the basic educational system of Gansu Province
in northwest China was initiated recently.
</P>
<P>
With total funds of 11.2 million pounds (about 16 million U.S.
dollars) from the British government, the program is targeted at
spurring the fundamental education system in several poor ethnic
regions here, including the Kangle, Dongxiang, Jishishan, and
Hezheng counties, where a large proportion of Hui ethnic children,
especially girls, are unable to go to school.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, more school-aged children are expected to
receive grants-in-aid to finish their primary and junior high
school education over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the two governments will set up and renovate
schools and provide educational facilities for the students.
Teachers here will also attend training classes to enhance the
local educational level.
</P>
<P>
This support for education program has been under consideration
since June 1997 by the British Agency for International
Development. After three formal visits and an investigation tour
of Gansu, the British signed a final agreement with China this
July to start the program.

LONDON, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Irish cabinet and Northern
Ireland's new coalition cabinet gathered in Northern Ireland's
ancient cathedral city of Armagh Monday to promote political
cooperation between the north and south.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Northern Irish First Minister David Trimble and
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern are expected to formally
establish six new cross-border bodies including the ministerial
council, which will allow ministers to work together in the areas
of health, education, transport, environment, tourism and
education.
</P>
<P>
The cross-border bodies, to be set up under the 1998 Good
Friday Agreement, also include institutions to promote the Irish
and Ulster-Scots languages, inland waterways, and issues
concerning health and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Ahern described the establishment of the council as the end of
hundreds of years of hatred, and the beginning of everyday
politics on the island of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
He added that many of the key elements of the Good Friday
Agreement would be implemented by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
However, Nigel Dodds and Peter Robinson, two Northern Irish
ministers from the Democratic Unionist Party, refused to attend

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt Open to Small Budget Cut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Monday it will accept cuts by Congress in the 2000 national budget,
but stressed that any reduction should be minimal and should keep
the budget figure higher than the amount appropriated last year.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said President Joseph
Estrada and his cabinet believe Congress will cut the proposed 651-
billion-peso (16.3 billion U.S. dollars) budget, noting the
position of the Senate finance committee that the government's
total projected expenditures will have to be reduced.
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to accept that we can reduce the budget, we
can tighten our belts, but it should not be in the amount of 60
billion pesos (1.5 billion dollars)," Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
"The president has already given instructions to the members of
the cabinet that the departments should submit to Congress a list
of items in their budget which could be slashed and items which
should not be slashed," he said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
The proposed 60-billion-peso Senate cut was based on the
assumption that there will be a 62.5-billion-peso (1.56 billion
dollars) budget deficit next year, as a result of continuing weak
revenue performance of income-generating agencies of the
government.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said the government would be willing to accept a smaller
cut than 20 billion pesos (500 million dollars), because any cut
more than that could seriously derail critical government projects.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that President Estrada had talked with members of
Congress, including Senator John Osmena, chairman of the Senate
Finance Committee, as part of an effort to convinced them to
approve the budget.
</P>
<P>
The Senate is scheduled to vote on the 2000 budget in Monday
night's caucus, before the bicameral conference.
</P>
<P>
The final version of the budget is expected to be submitted to
President Estrada anytime this week, the signing of which largely
depends on how big is the cut.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Outlines Foreign Policy in New </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's foreign policy
direction in the new millennium will be more proactive rather than
reactive, President Olusegun Obasanjo was quoted as saying by The
Guardian Monday.
</P>
<P>
At the dawn of the new millennium, he said Nigeria is ready to
resume its historic role of championing the aspirations and hopes
of Africa, a continent which has long been relegated to the
periphery of global affairs.
</P>
<P>
While Africa remains the primary centerpiece of Nigeria's
foreign policy, the on-going globalization process would be
adopted for the country, the president said at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's foreign policy would be guided by a more global
orientation "capable of taking the entire globe, not just Africa,
as the canvass of its exertion," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that his government would support the struggle for a
globalized world where "there would be less poverty and
deprivation, less marginalization of peoples and countries, less
disparity within and between nations, less violation of human
rights, less instability of societies and less environmental
degradation."
</P>
<P>
The president called for the strengthening of the Organization
of African Unity (OAU) to enable it to achieve the renaissance for
the continent.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the decentralization and reforms at the global
levels of such institutions as the United Nations, the World Bank,
the International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization.

<HEADLINE> Stock Market Reacts Positively to Development of China's West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 13 (Xinhua) -- China's major strategy to
develop its western areas has caused a positive reaction on the
stock market in the last few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Stock prices of a number of companies such as the Quanxing
Company (Sichuan) and Sanpu Company (Qinghai), have soared.
</P>
<P>
China's 10 western regions, including Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia,
Qinghai, Xinjiang, Tibet, Sichuan, Chongqing, Yunnan and Guizhou,
have more than 100 publicly-listed companies. The majority of them
are in agriculture, commerce and tourism. A few of them have
entered software and other high-tech sectors.
</P>
<P>
In mid-November, a national economic conference decided to
accelerate the development of the western regions, causing an
instant reaction on the stock market. On November 18, six
companies were among the top 10 stocks reporting the highest gains
at the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Analysts pointed out that China's western regions have vast
areas of land and a huge population, as well as rich resources in
coal, petroleum, natural gas and nonferrous metals. A few cities
such as Xi'an and Chengdu, are also important centers of
scientific and technological research and higher education.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the net asset earning of Xinjiang's listed companies
averaged 12 percent. In 1998, the net profits of these companies
rose by 30 percent on average.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the popularity of "west concept stocks" will
bring more opportunities to the western areas and accelerate
industrial and corporate reform there.
</P>
<P>
The western areas account for 56 percent of China's territory
and 50 percent of major minerals.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Irish cabinet and Northern
Ireland's new coalition cabinet gathered in Northern Ireland's
ancient cathedral city of Armagh Monday to promote political
cooperation between the north and south.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Northern Irish First Minister David Trimble and
Irish Prime Minister Bertie Ahern are expected to formally
establish six new cross-border bodies including the ministerial
council, which will allow ministers to work together in the areas
of health, education, transport, environment, tourism and
education.
</P>
<P>
The cross-border bodies, to be set up under the 1998 Good
Friday Agreement, also include institutions to promote the Irish
and Ulster-Scots languages, inland waterways, and issues
concerning health and the European Union.
</P>
<P>
Ahern described the establishment of the council as the end of
hundreds of years of hatred, and the beginning of everyday
politics on the island of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
He added that many of the key elements of the Good Friday
Agreement would be implemented by the end of the week.
</P>
<P>
However, Nigel Dodds and Peter Robinson, two Northern Irish
ministers from the Democratic Unionist Party, refused to attend
the meeting, since they believe the new cross-border bodies pave
the way towards a united Ireland -- the aim of their republican
foes.

<HEADLINE> Thai Authority to Punish "Careless" Exporters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Agriculture
and Cooperative of Thailand will penalize local exporters of
agricultural products who do not comply with regulations and
always maintain standardized quality of their products, the Thai
News Agency (TNA) said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Somchai Charnnarongkul, director of the Department of
Agriculture's Center for Export Promotion of Thai Agricultural
Products was quoted as saying that a new rule had been introduced
to monitor and control quality of Thai farm products, as well as
to maintain good quality and reputation of Thai food products in
the international community.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rule, exporters whose food products were
rejected by importing countries three times due to non-compliance
with their regulations and lower-than-agreed standard would be
suspended their export license for one month, and those whose
products were rejected consecutively three time would be
permanently banned from exporting, he said.
</P>
<P>
" The new rule will also help prevent damaged image to overall
Thai exports caused by only a small group of careless or
inconsiderate exporters, and will indirectly encourage local
exporters to continually improve and develop quality of their
products", he noted.
</P>
<P>
Somchai said that the Department of Agriculture could inspect
and detect rejected exporters from registered numbers imprinted in
packages or other containers.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's anti-terrorist
court in Karachi Monday delayed bringing charges against deposed
prime minister Nawaz Sharif after disputes over transcripts of
evidence.
</P>
<P>
Sharif, his brother Shahbaz Sharif, and five others were
accused of criminal conspiracy, attempted murder and kidnapping,
attempted hijacking. They face the death penalty if they are
convicted.
</P>
<P>
The accused were due to be charged at the Karachi-based anti-
terrorist court Monday.
</P>
<P>
But Judge Shabbir Ahmed adjourned the hearing until next Monday
to allow time for the defense to be provided with full copies of
transcripts of audio tapes from the aviation authorities.
</P>
<P>
Former prime minister Sharif was in detention since he was
ousted by the army led by General Pervaiz Musharraf in a coup on
October 12. Musharraf has now assumed the office of Pakistan's
Chief Executive.
</P>
<P>
Sharif Monday described the charges against him and others as
fabricated and vowed to fight and win legal battle.
</P>
<P>
"Prosecution has no case and they will lose," he told reporters
before the court proceedings.

<P>
JAKARTA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's rice import in
1999 was down as the country's national production gradually
increased, a senior official said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the State Logistic Agency (Bulog) Yusuf Kalla said
that the country's rice import figure in 1999 was 1.5 million tons.
</P>
<P>
"Based on the figure, it is clear that import of rice in 1999
is far lower than the 1998 figure which reached 5.9 million tons.
Import of rice in 1999 has went down at least 75 percent compared
to the 1998," Kalla told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He also said that for the next year Indonesia manages to import
1.5 million tons of rice.
</P>
<P>
"But, we will also receive rice assistance from abroad at least
1 million ton in the next year," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the agency needs 9.09 trillion rupiah ( 1.3
billion U.S. dollars) in the next fiscal year to finance the
national food provisions.

<HEADLINE> Moody's Upgrades Five Thailand's Banks Outlooks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Moody's Investors Service, the
credit rating agency, upgraded the outlook for the ratings of five
Thai banks and financial institutions from negative to stable,
Channel 9, a state television station reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Among them are Thai Military Bank, Bank of Ayudhya, Siam City
Bank,Bangkok Metropolitan Bank and Industrial Finance Corporation
of Thailand (IFCT).
</P>
<P>
The change in outlook for these five banks and institutions
reflects the more stable operating environment in Thailand and
thus the better predictability of the ultimate cost of
reconstructing the country's financial system.
</P>
<P>
Moody's noted that the mid-sized commercial banks Bank of
Ayudhya and Thai Military Bank, and the partly government-owned
specialized development finance institution IFCT, are benefiting
from the greater stability in the crisis-hit local economy: low
interest rates have contained both the numbers of loan defaults
and their cost of carry.
</P>
<P>
Bangkok Metropolitan Bank and Siam City Bank were among the
mid-sized banks taken over by the regulators in late 1997 and
early 1998, and are due to be sold to third parties.
</P>
<P>
Further support will be needed for these banks to cover their
remaining substantial loan losses, and this is likely to be
supplied by the government in the context of their eventual sale.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's improved
business environment has drawn more overseas companies with a rise
of 1.7 percent in regional representation in 1999, according to a
recent survey.
</P>
<P>
The findings of the survey conducted by Hong Kong Industry
Department showed that the number of regional operations by
overseas companies in Hong Kong increased by 1.7 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The survey has also identified a total of 2,490 regional
operations, comprising 840 regional headquarters and 1,650
regional offices.
</P>
<P>
"This is a good sign that our business environment has turned
for the better and that international business interest in Hong
Kong is on the rise," said a spokesman for the department.
</P>
<P>
In a similar survey conducted by the department in 1998, a
decrease of 2.6 percent was recorded, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
In terms of regional headquarters, the United States is the
largest source country with 205 companies, followed by Japan with
114 companies and the United Kingdom with 82 companies. Japan has
the largest number of regional offices in Hong Kong with 368
companies.
</P>
<P>
The major lines of business of both regional headquarters and
offices are wholesale and retail, import and export, and other
business services, finance and banking, manufacturing, and
transport and related services, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The survey has found that most of the 411 responding companies
considered cleanliness of government to be the most important
factor for choosing Hong Kong as the location for setting up a
regional headquarters or office. Other important factors include
access to information, banking and financial facilities,
geographical location and tax regime.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether they would consider relocating elsewhere, 95
percent of the headquarters and 94 percent of the regional offices
concerned indicated that they would maintain their operations in
Hong Kong.

"In order to preserve the unity of the country and its

televised speech.
</P>
<P>
He said emergency laws take effect on Monday and the general
election authority would set a date for new National Assembly
elections.
</P>
<P>
These moves were apparently set off by recent discord between
al-Bashir, also chairman of the ruling National Congress Party
(NCP) and Hassan al Turabi, the powerful parliament speaker and
NCP secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
The parliament had been expected to vote on amendments on
Tuesday that would drastically reduce the president's powers,
despite el-Bashir's objection to the legislation.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the most sensitive article in the legislation was
that the president can be impeached by the parliament with a
two-thirds majority.

<HEADLINE> Stronger China-U.S. Ties Benefit Both Sides: Chinese Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) Li Ruihuan said here over the weekend that
China and the United States have no fundamental conflict of
interests and that developing bilateral relations will benefit
both countries.
</P>
<P>
On the whole, Sino-American relations have been developing
arduously, Li said in an interview with Japan Broadcasting Corp. (
NHK).
</P>
<P>
Li said the reaching of an agreement between China and the U.S.
on China's accession to the World Trade Organization will promote
bilateral economic and trade cooperation, help improve Sino-
American relations and inject new vigor and vitality into the
world economy.
</P>
<P>
Li said China hopes that the U.S. strictly abides by the three
Sino-American joint communiques and relevant commitments, so that
Sino-American relations can continue to develop and improve.
</P>
<P>
Li said China's major tasks presently are to promote
productivity, strengthen the overall national strength and improve
the living standard of the people, and that China needs a long-
term peaceful international environment and is willing to develop
friendly relations with all countries, including the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Li charged that recently the U.S. government, by distorting
facts, criticized China for its handling of the issue of Falun
Gong, which is actually an evil cult, and even took so-called
sanctionary acts against China. These moves have constituted
serious violations of norms governing international relations and
wanton interference in China's internal affairs, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li urged the U.S. government not to take further acts to hurt
the Chinese people's feelings, and not to set up new obstacles
against the development of Sino-American relations.

<HEADLINE> Mainland-Funded Businesses Contribute to Macao's Stability, Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Some 200 Chinese mainland-funded
businesses with a combined assets of more than 100 billion Hong
Kong dollars have been the largest investors, according to Li
Shengli, secretary general of the Chinese Enterprises Association
of Macao.
</P>
<P>
Currently, these businesses' foreign trade volume accounts for
30 percent of Macao's total import and export trade, and they
account for 52 percent in the region's financial and insurance
services, 50 percent in its tourism and catering services, and 70
percent in its real estate industry, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
For decades, these businesses have provided the guarantee for
Macao's economic development, brisk markets and social stability,
according to Li.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese mainland-funded businesses have been the largest
supplier of fresh commodities such as live poultry, pigs, cattle,
sheep and fish and vegetables, which account for 80 percent of all
the region consumes. More than 300 truckloads of such fresh
commodities are sent here every day.
</P>
<P>
The Nam Yue company has set up a wholesale food market with
more than 40 million patacas to ensure the supply of such fresh
commodities to Macao.
</P>
<P>
These businesses have been active in undertaking local
infrastructure projects, tourism and processing industry. While
helping the region with labor from the mainland, these firms have
also provided more than 10,000 job opportunities and conducted
professional training for local people.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the mainland-funded enterprises also have been
active in publicizing the Basic Law of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) since 1998.
</P>
<P>
As the day of Macao's return is drawing near, which is December
20, these businesses have increased the supply of daily
necessities and hotels have launched new catering services for
guests, journalists and tourists from across the world.
</P>
<P>
Li said that after Macao's return, these Chinese mainland-
funded businesses will continue to serve Macao in accordance with
the principle of "one country, two systems" and the guidelines of
the Basic Law of the Macao SAR.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Mainland Stops Sugar Imports via </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government
has ordered all major sugar importers to stop routing consignments
through the island State of Zanzibar, from where it is reshipped
to the mainland without paying suspended duty.
</P>
<P>
The order was issued to all importers last week following what
was described by Customs officials as "falling official returns"
at the Dar es Salaam Port, the Nairobi-based East African weekly
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Importers have been avoiding the port since the duty was
introduced last year, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The move by the Tanzanian authorities is to protect local sugar
 producers and also help improve revenue collection at the port.
</P>
<P>
In order to protect local industries, a suspended duty of 30
percent on all sugar imports was imposed by the government in July
last year.
</P>
<P>
However, sugar importers began channeling consignments through
Zanzibar, from where it is taken to the mainland through
unofficial entry points on the country's porous 1,000-kilometer
coastline.
</P>
<P>
With its own government and parliament, Zanzibar which is a
semi-autonomous State in the United Republic of Tanzania, does not
charge suspended duty on a broad range of imports which includes
sugar.
</P>
<P>
An official from the Tanzanian Ministry of Commerce and
Industry was quoted as saying that importers had been ordered to
sell the sugar in Zanzibar, or pay duty if they wanted to ship it
to the mainland.
</P>
<P>
The smuggling of imported sugar into the mainland is fuelled by
the deficit which is mainly a result of low production.
</P>
<P>
The four major sugar factories in the country produced 120,000
tons of sugar last year, which was less than half the projected
national demand of 300,000 tons per year.

MACAO, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Cultural heritage and historical
records, rather than casinos and hotels, will be the most
significant assets that Macao will leave for the future, said Choi
San, a well-known scholar in Macao culture study.
</P>
<P>
"It is Macao that let the Chinese people know about telescope,
candy and modern astronomy ," Choi, 55, said.
</P>
<P>
With the advent of the Portuguese in 1553, Macao has become the
Chinese territory that western culture first embarked on. Produces
of western civilization, such as clock, pipe organ, geometry and
camera, entered China through Macao.
</P>
<P>
It is on this tiny pieces of land that "Bible" was first
translated into Chinese and the first western style university in

conjunction of four most representative human civilizations of
China, Greek, India and Islam, which has helped form the unique
Macao culture.
</P>
<P>
Choi, who is with the Macao Cultural Institute, said Macao has
never suffered from war or major social unrest in the past four
centuries, even in the World War II.
</P>
<P>
Macao has protected even better some cultural heritages than
their places of origin and Macao has indeed become a city of
museum with abundant treasure, he said.
</P>
<P>
Architecture of the Renaissance period can be easily seen in
the streets of Macao. The Macao Museum stores precious documents
and cultural relics that are hard to find in Lisbon. Macao also
boasts the largest Portuguese language library that houses ancient
publications recording the colonial history of Portugal, Choi said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Macao also brings Chinese culture to Europe,
Africa and Latin America, as Portuguese merchants made their trip
home with china, tea and silk. Macao-Lisbon course is thus
regarded as a "marine silk road."
</P>
<P>
As the start of "marine silk road," Macao can match with
Dunhuang, which is taken as a conjunction of the "silk road," Choi
said.
</P>
<P>
Because of its special location, Chinese ideologists Lin Zexu,
Wei Yuan and Sun Yat-sen made Macao a base of learning from the
west and a base for social reform and revolution.
</P>
<P>
"The history of Macao is also a good textbook on China's reform
and opening-up which will offer valuable experience and in-depth
lessons for China in the 21st century," said Choi. He believed
that making good use of the Macao culture will open new space for
Macao's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
In regard to "Macaology" proposed by some scholars, Choi said,
"although Macaology is little known so far, yet it is of broad
prospects. The study of Macao culture will make people more
confident about Macao's future."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader Expects Continued Development of Sino-Japanese Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) Li Ruihuan said here that friendly cooperation
between Japan and China has profound social basis and is bound to
advance vigorously and pass on from generation to generation.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is here on a goodwill visit, made the statement in an
interview with Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK) over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
He said that Japan and China, which are close neighbors to each
other and are both important countries in the Asia-Pacific region,
share deep cultural origins and are well complementary to each
other in economic development.
</P>
<P>
Lasting peace, friendship and cooperation between the two
countries will be beneficial for the two countries to concentrate
on their construction as well as to maintain common prosperity and
development, and will contribute to peace and stability in Asia
and the world as a whole, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"This is in the essential interests of the people of the two
countries and also in line with the development trend of the time,
" he said, calling for sincere and unyielding efforts to achieve
such lasting peace, friendship and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Li said China will never forget those old friends while making
new friends in developing the cause of friendship with Japan.
</P>
<P>
"China and Japan can work together, we'll always be good
friends," he said.
</P>
<P>
"While not forgetting history, we should have our eyes more on
the future," Li said.
</P>
<P>
"We should guard against and eliminate the noises and
disruptive moves of a small number of people," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He called on people to heed the positive aspects and the bright
future of the Sino-Japanese friendship and expressed the belief
that a healthier and more stable Sino-Japanese relationship of
peace and cooperation will be brought into the new century so long
as efforts are made in accordance with the joint statement of the
governments of China and Japan, the Treaty of Peace and Friendship
between China and Japan, and the two countries' joint statement on
building friendly and cooperative partnership.
</P>
<P>
Li arrived here last Wednesday for a nine-day visit, his first
to Japan as the National Committee Chairman of the CPPCC.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Business Circles Positive on EU Candidacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Following the European Union's
weekend decision to offer Turkey candidacy for membership, there
have been positive reactions from Turkish business leaders.
</P>
<P>
Economic consideration is one of the major factors, if not
the most important, that the Turkish political leaders have
had in mind in seeking a membership of the 15-member
European club for years.
</P>
<P>
Fuat Miras, chairman of the Turkish Union of Chambers and
Commodity Exchanges, said that the EU's declaring Turkey a
candidate was a remarkable decision and that Turkey would benefit
from the candidate status.
</P>
<P>
However, according to the Anatolia News Agency, he warned that
from now on all eyes would be on Turkey, and said that "Turkey's
road to full EU membership is entirely in its own hands."
</P>
<P>
"It can do it in four or 14 years," he said, "but now Turkey
has to launch a program of compulsory transformation."
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Ankara Chamber of Industries Zafer Caglayan
said that Turkey has to restructure its economy and the sooner it
completes this transformation, the sooner it will enter the
European body.
</P>
<P>
Ekrem Demirtas, the chairman of Izmir Chamber of Commerce, said
that Turkey entered a completely new era with the EU's
accepting Turkey as candidate.
</P>
<P>
He indicated that candidacy would have many positive effects on
Turkish economic life. "The Greek veto on EU financial backing to
Turkey will be lifted with our candidate status. New cooperation
opportunities will open up between European and Turkish business
communities," he said.
</P>
<P>
Candidacy will also give new stimulus to the tourism sector in
2000 and this will help Turkey to recover from the economic crisis
much more quickly," he added.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's Economic Outlook Positive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- A leading U.S. rating
organization announced that it has upgraded Turkey's
macro-economic outlook from "stable" to "positive."
</P>
<P>
However, the New York-based Standard &AMP; Poor's maintained
Turkey's international credit rating at B, local Daily News
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report attributed the rosy prediction to recent
improvements in Turkey's political situation, which it expects
will be helpful in boosting the country's economy and in
attracting investments in the country.
</P>
<P>
Turkey was granted candidate status for the European Union (EU)
last Friday at the EU Helsinki summit.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the move by the rating agency hints at a
possible upgrading of Turkey's credit rating in the future.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader Refutes "China Threat" Fallacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese leader Li
Ruihuan, in an interview with Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK) here
over the weekend, lashed out at the "China Threat" fallacy, saying
that a developed China will not pose a threat to any country.
</P>
<P>
Li, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), is in Japan on a nine-
day official good-will visit.
</P>
<P>
In the interview, Li described the "China Threat" fallacy,
spread around the world in recent years by a small group of people
with ulterior motives, as utterly unjustifiable.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether China will become a political, economic and
military superpower that threatens Asia, Li said that China will
not pose a threat to any country even if it is developed.
</P>
<P>
"China, having pursued an independent foreign policy of peace,
hopes to co-exist with other countries peacefully, and wishes to
have a peaceful, stable international atmosphere," he said, adding
"China will not change this policy as it is in the Chinese
people's long-term fundamental interests."
</P>
<P>
China once suffered continued bullying and humiliation by
foreign powers in the past century, Li said, the peace-loving
Chinese people abhor any aggression and will never impose such
sufferings on others.
</P>
<P>
Instead, China will bring about troubles to other countries if
it fails to develop.
</P>
<P>
"With a population of more than 1.2 billion people, China will
see no domestic stability if its economy stops growing, and its
people will rush abroad to escape famine and poverty under that
scenario," Li said, adding that could be a possible "threat" to
other countries.
</P>
<P>
"We do not worry about a rich China, but a poor China," Li
quoted a far-sighted leader of a Southeast Asian country as
telling him.
</P>
<P>
With the rapid economic development in recent years, China's
ability of economic cooperation with other countries has also been
strengthened, resulting in huge benefits to its cooperation
partners including Japan, the Chinese leader pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Good to every country in the world, China's stability and
development are great contributions to world peace and development,
Li told the NHK.
</P>
<P>
The "China Threat" fallacy, preached by a handful of people
with the aim to hinder China's development, is doomed to failure,
for China's development is irresistible, Li said.

<HEADLINE> IOC Welcomes Deal Between Nike and 2000 Games Organizers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee (IOC) has hailed the agreement reached between Nike, the
Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG) and the
Australian Olympic Committee for Nike to become a SOCOG sponsor.
</P>
<P>
"We are delighted with the manner in which Nike has stepped in
to increase its support to athletes. This new involvement with the
Sydney Games and the Olympic Movement is a further and welcome
demonstration of Nike's long-standing commitment." Richard W.
Pound, IOC First Vice-president and Chairman of the IOC Marketing
Commission, said on Sunday in Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
"From Steve Ovett's win in the 800 meters at the 1980 Moscow
Olympic Games to Cathy Freeman's memorable performance in Atlanta
to Picabo Street's thrilling victory in Nagano, Nike always has
been proud of our Olympic athletes and teams," Nike CEO Philip H.
Knight said.
</P>
<P>
"Our partnership with the Australian Olympic Committee brings
this relationship to the next level. We are very excited to
support the Australian Team, with its rich Olympic history, by
providing them with innovative performance products as they
compete against the world's best in 2000 and beyond," Knight said.
</P>
<P>
The discussions involved both Michael Knight, Minister for the
Olympics and John Coates, President of the Australian Olympic
Committee. Nike will outfit the Australian Olympic and Paralympic
Teams and provide value-in-kind to SOCOG.
</P>
<P>
The IOC said that it would like to congratulate all parties on
the speed with which this partnership was culminated.
</P>
<P>
Nike will provide uniforms and sporting equipment to the
athletes of the Australian Olympic and Paralympic teams for the
Games in 2000,as well as the Olympic Winter Games in 2002 and the
Olympic Games in 2004.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Current Account Surplus Falls for 9th Straight Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Japan's current account surplus
fell to 1,084.8 billion yen (10.2 billion U.S. dollars) in October,
16.7 percent down from a year earlier, due mainly to decreasing
exports on a strong yen, the Japanese Finance Ministry said Monday.
</P>
<P>
It was the ninth straight month of year-on-year decline in the
surplus.
</P>
<P>
The surplus in goods and services trade totaled 707.8 billion
yen (6.7 billion dollars), down 11.4 percent, the ministry said in
a preliminary report.
</P>
<P>
Merchandise trade registered a surplus of 1,304.7 billion yen (
12.3 billion dollars), down 14.4 percent, with exports down 6.1
percent to 3,959.5 billion yen (37.4 billion dollars) and imports
down 1.4 percent to 2,654.8 billion yen (25.1 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The services deficit decreased 17.7 percent to 596.9 billion
yen (5.6 billion dollars), due to a fall in patent royalty
payments and a growing tendency among Japanese tourists to spend
less on their overseas trips.
</P>
<P>
The current-account balance is the difference between a
country's income from foreign sources and foreign obligations
payable, excluding net capital investment.
</P>
<P>
Ministry officials said the current account surplus shrank as
the yen's advance against the U.S. dollar caused exports to shrink
at a faster clip than imports.
</P>
<P>
In October, the yen averaged 105.97 to the U.S. dollar, up from
121.30 yen a year before.

<HEADLINE> Israel, PNA to Complete Framework Draft in a Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Israel and the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) will finish drawing up a first draft of
the framework agreement within four weeks, said a senior Israeli
official.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made during talks held last week by
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright with Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and PNA Chairman Yasser Arafat, the official
told local daily Haaretz Monday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinians were slowing down the pace of their
final-status talks with Israel just to wait for developments on
the Syrian-Israeli track, said the official.
</P>
<P>
During her visit here last week, Albright offered Barak and
Arafat a format for continuing the talks on the framework
agreement, to enable progress to be made and render possible a
summit meeting by the two leaders with U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
The main points of the format include: the two sides will
complete a first draft of the framework agreement by January 10,
2000; Arafat will be invited to a meeting with Clinton in
Washington; U.S. peace envoy Dennis Ross will visit the region on
January 15 and will be involved in the talks continuously until
the summit meeting; and Albright will return for another visit to
the region late January during which she will assess the progress
made in the talks and then give recommendation to Clinton on
whether to convene a summit.
</P>
<P>
Clinton has made such a meeting conditional on progress being
made in direct talks between the two sides. And the format was
intended to meet the Palestinians' demand for the United States to
step its involvement in the talks, in return for progress toward an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the talks between the two sides broke down due to
Israel's continued settlement activities. The Palestinian side
insisted that Israel freeze construction in settlements, stating
that Barak's announcement on a halt to future tenders was not
enough.
</P>
<P>
After Barak promised to halt such activities, the two sides
decided to meet again Monday at the Erez checkpoint on the border
with Gaza.
</P>
<P>
On the agenda of Monday's talks is the subject of "the borders
and the settlements" at the request of the Palestinian side.
</P>
<P>
Barak and Arafat spoke by telephone over the weekend after
Barak extended his condolences to Arafat on the death of his
eldest sister, who passed away on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
During the conversation, which the official described as
positive, the two leaders exchanged family experiences and spoke
about other family matters.

<HEADLINE> Allied Forces in Congo Vow to Break Siege Of Ikela </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The allied forces of the four
African countries vowed to break the siege of DRC's central town
of Ikela and reopen supply lines to thousands of troops trapped
there, a report from Namibia's capital Windhoek said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Heads of state and senior government officials from the
Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Zimbabwe, Namibia and
Angola expressed the determination at the end of a SADC (the
Southern african Development community) Allied Forces summit in
Namibia Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe said: "We treat this siege
with a sense of great seriousness and, of course, we will not
allow it."
</P>
<P>
"We will break the siege," he stressed. But he did not specify
how they would dismantle the siege of Ikela.
</P>
<P>
The summit called for reviewing the DRC peace process and
finding ways of consolidating the four-nation group's efforts
towards enhancing their relationship.
</P>
<P>
The allied forces from Zimbabwe, Angola and Namibia have for a
long time been denied access to Ikela, some 200 kilometers south
of Kisangani, through territories recently occupied by the
Congolese Rally for Democracy rebels and their Rwandan backers.
</P>
<P>
The capture of three towns between Ikela and Mboende completely
isolated Ikela from the main supply areas at Mbandaka on the main
river Congo.
</P>
<P>
Deputy commander of the allied forces, Nambundunga of Namibia,
said Sunday that Ikela remains a trouble-some spot and the troops
there have come under direct attack from the defiant rebels.
</P>
<P>
Namibian President Sam Nujoma and President of the DRC Laurent
Kabila attended the summit. Angola was represented by its defence
minister.
</P>
<P>
This was the first meeting held in a country directly involved
in the DRC conflict since the signing of the Lusaka Peace Accord
on July 10 this year.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech at the summit, Nujoma said that of
particular concern was the blatant violation of the cease-fire
agreement in the area around Ikela.
</P>
<P>
He urged all the parties in the conflict to come to a consensus
and agree on the appointment of a neutral facilitator and for all
the Congolese to participate in the national dialog.
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope that the parties would do everything possible
to ensure strict adherence to the cease-fire agreement," he said.

<HEADLINE> China Curbs Growth of New-Poor Population </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, December 13 (Xinhua) -- China is taking measures to
prevent people who have escaped from poverty from returning to it.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to three decades of effort, the number of rural people
who living below the poverty line has been reduced from 250
million in 1978 to 42 million last year.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, due to a poor ecological environment, backward
infrastructure, and a high rate of illiteracy, about 10 percent of
the people who become better-off because of government aid return
to poverty again. The figure can rise to 20 percent in years when
severe natural disasters occur.
</P>
<P>
In Xihaigu in northwest China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region,
one of the eight poorest areas in the country, as much as 50
percent of the people who had become better-off became needy again
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
To curb the reoccurrence of a new-poverty population, the
Agricultural Bank of China has issued more than 8 billion yuan in
the form of small loans to support 1.3 million households in their
fight against poverty.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, over 20 provinces and autonomous regions have also
granted small loans to families with financial needs to develop
farm and sideline production.
</P>
<P>
The State Office for Poverty Alleviation and Development has
decided to continue to assist those needy counties which had
become relatively better-off by offering them a longer period of
preferential policies.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- More and more Angolan refugees
are entering Zambia, police sources confirmed a report by Monday's
Zambia Daily Mail newspaper.
</P>
<P>
According to the sources, more Angolan refugees continued
pouring into Kalabo, North-Western Province, either by boat or on
foot.
</P>
<P>
They said the number of refugees in the area had gone up from
1,400 to more than 3,000 by Sunday afternoon and more were
expected to arrive in Kalabo.
</P>
<P>
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR)
representative Oluseyi Balujaye said last week that the largest
group of refugees of 1,450 was in Kalabo while another 700 were
reported in Lukulu, Western Province.
</P>
<P>
An additional 600 were presumed to be on the Zambezi plains.
</P>
<P>
The total number of Angolan refugees that have entered Zambia
since October stands at 7,400, according to the UNHCR.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 241 Angolan government soldiers fled into Zambia
last week, who were disarmed after surrendering themselves to the
Zambian authorities.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian authorities are abiding by the international law
which does not recognize former soldiers as refugees and separated
them from the civilians.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leader Reiterates China's Stance on Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese leader Li
Ruihuan reiterated China's position here over the weekend that
China will not hesitate to pay any price for the solution of the
Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
Li, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), made the statement on
Taiwan in an interview with the Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK).
</P>
<P>
Asked why the Chinese government does not promise to renounce
the use of force in solving the Taiwan issue, Li stressed: "No
Chinese leader nor any generation of the Chinese leadership has
the right to discard Taiwan from its motherland."
</P>
<P>
Li, who is on a nine-day goodwill visit to Japan, warned that
no one should underestimate China's determination and capabilities
in the settlement of the issue.
</P>
<P>
In commenting on the "two states theory" of Lee Teng-hui,
leader of the Taiwanese authorities, Li noted that the nubbin of
the theory is to thoroughly negate the principle of "one China
policy" that has been recognized by the international community,
with the aim of cutting the province out of the Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC Chairman described Lee Teng-hui's statement as
complete betrayal of the interests of the Chinese nation,
tremendous harm to the social stability and development of the
Taiwan province, severe damage to the political groundwork for
developing cross-strait ties, and trouble to peace and stability
in Asia and the world.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, it has incurred strong opposition from the Chinese
people and found no support from the international community, Li
added.
</P>
<P>
The principles of "peaceful reunification" and "one country,
two systems" are China's basic approach to the solution of the
Taiwan issue, which takes into full account of the current
realities of the province and the practical interests of the
Taiwan compatriots, Li told the NHK.
</P>
<P>
As the people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait are
compatriots and brothers who are of an identical ancestry, what
differences could not be put aside and what enmities could not be
melted under the one China principle? Li asked.
</P>
<P>
"As long as the Taiwan authorities show sincerity in conformity
to the people's will, we can sit together and have peaceful
consultations, and a solution will eventually be found and the
ultimate goal of peaceful reunification will be achieved," he
assured.
</P>
<P>
The development of the situation across the Taiwan Strait
hinges on whether the Taiwan authorities could wake up at the last
moment, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that since the Chinese people always consider
sovereignty and territorial integrity more important than their
own life, no Chinese leader nor any generation of the Chinese
leadership will give away any part of the Chinese territory.
</P>
<P>
"If anybody persists in going his own way to segment Taiwan
from the Map of China in disregard of the desire of the Chinese
people on both sides of the Taiwan Strait for peaceful
reunification, prosperity and development, we will have no other
choice." Li warned.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Pudong Draws More Domestic Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Pudong New Area, an
booming financial and trade zone set up in the early 1990 in China
's leading industrial center of Shanghai, has drawn an increasing
number of domestic investors while at the same time drawing
multinationals.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that some 300 medium-sized and large
enterprises from all over China have opened subsidiaries in Pudong.
</P>
<P>
According to sources with the area's administration committee,
these businesses are mainly engaged in the area's pillar
industries such as automobiles, information technology, iron and
steel, household appliances, petrochemicals, and pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
The China Shipping Group, a state-owned shipping conglomerate,
for example, has established in Pudong the country's largest
shipyard, the China Shipping Industry Co., Ltd., with registered
capital of 200 million yuan (24 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Wenzhou People's Electrical Equipment Group, a private
enterprise based in Wenzhou, a city in east China's Zhejiang
Province, has set up its production center in Pudong with an
investment of 100 million yuan (12 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute the increase in domestic investment to the
improved business environment in the area.
</P>
<P>
Since the early 1990, Pudong has built 10 major infrastructure
projects, and has another 10 under way, including an international
airport, a subway, and a pedestrian passage across the Huangpu
River separating the area from downtown Shanghai. At least 200
billion yuan has been used for infrastructure construction to date.
</P>
<P>
Pudong is now focusing on becoming an international banking,
trade, tourism, conference, and exhibition center in the next
century.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The freed nine-member crew of a
 Ukrainian cargo plane, who were charged with espionage, have been
given seven days to leave Zambia, a Zambian newspaper reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Lawyer of the Ukrainians, Sakwiba Sikota, said Sunday that the
crew members who were discharged Friday had their visas extended
for a week, the Post said.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka High Court discharged the Ukrainians after Director
of Public Prosecutions Mukelabai Mukelabai entered a nolle
prosequi for all the accused, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The defense counsel made an application to have their passports
and the plane used by the Ukrainian Air crew back to the owners.
</P>
<P>
The court only agreed to release the passports but rejected to
returning the plane, saying it is under the custody of the
security authorities.
</P>
<P>
The plane was detained for passing over a protected military
spot around the Lusaka International Airport on August 15 this
year while flying over the airport.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's improved
business environment has drawn more foreign companies with a rise
of 1.7 percent in regional representation in 1999, according to a
recent survey.
</P>
<P>
The findings of the survey conducted by Hong Kong Industry
Department showed that the number of regional operations by
overseas companies in Hong Kong increased by 1.7 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The survey has also identified a total of 2,490 regional
operations, comprising 840 regional headquarters and 1,650
regional offices.
</P>
<P>
"This is a good sign that our business environment has turned
for the better and that international business interest in Hong
Kong is on the rise," said a spokesman for the department.
</P>
<P>
In a similar survey conducted by the department in 1998, a
decrease of 2.6 percent was recorded, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
In terms of regional headquarters, the United States is the
largest source country with 205 companies, followed by Japan with
114 companies and the United Kingdom with 82 companies. Japan has
the largest number of regional offices in Hong Kong with 368
companies.
</P>
<P>
The major lines of business of both regional headquarters and
offices are wholesale and retail, import and export, and other
business services, finance and banking, manufacturing, and
transport and related services, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The survey has found that most of the 411 responding companies
considered cleanliness of government to be the most important
factor for choosing Hong Kong as the location for setting up a
regional headquarters or office. Other important factors include
access to information, banking and financial facilities,
geographical location and tax regime.
</P>
<P>
When asked whether they would consider relocating elsewhere, 95
percent of the headquarters and 94 percent of the regional offices
concerned indicated that they would maintain their operations in
Hong Kong.

MANILA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government and
the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) are expected to complete
Tuesday the proposed rules and procedures for the formal talks as
they meet Monday, official media said.
</P>
<P>
The two-day talks between the government panel and that of the
rebel group, which started Monday at the Islamic Da'wah Center in
Sultan Kudarat, Maguindanao, will focus on security aspect,
Philippine News Agency (PNA) said.

<P>
MILF spokesman and peace talk panel member Ghadzali Jaafar was
quoted as saying that the formal talks will soon begin once both
panels agreed on the rules as guidelines.
</P>
<P>
"If we can make a rule, probably the first formal talks will be
held next year," said Jaafar.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Defense Undersecretary and government panel chairman
Orlando Soriano and his counterpart in the MILF, Ustadz Aleem
Abdulaziz Mimbantas, decided to hold the formal talks on December
15.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Singapore's Unemployment Rate Up in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's seasonally-
adjusted unemployment rate in September 1999 hit four percent, up
from the average 3.6 percent for the first half of this year but
lower than the 4.4 percent registered a year ago, according to
data released by Singapore Ministry of Manpower (MOM) Monday.
</P>
<P>
In its report on "Labor Market, Third Quarter 1999", MOM said
the number of seasonally adjusted unemployed persons was estimated
at 79,900 in September 1999 compared with 65,900 in June of this
year.
</P>
<P>
MOM said 3,395 workers were retrenched in the third quarter
1999, bringing the total number displaced to 10,147 in the first
nine month of this year with workers retrenched in the
manufacturing accounting for 53 percent of the total retrenchment
in the quarter and the services sector contributing 45 percent of
the total.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, 65 percent of the locals retrenched in the second
quarter of this year were re-employed by September, MOM added.
</P>
<P>
MOM said job vacancies surged by 30 percent to 25,126 at the
end of September 1999 from 19,299 three months ago.
</P>
<P>
However, it added, many of the displaced lower educated workers
continue to have difficulties meeting the skill requirement of the
new jobs that are created.
</P>
<P>
On the outlook for the labor market in the fourth quarter, MOM
said retrenchment will continue, especially in manufacturing
sector, as companies restructure in response to rapid
globalisation, technical advance and shorter product circles. It
expects retrenchment for the whole year of 1999 to be more than 15,
000, with structural unemployment remaining an area of concern.

TOKYO, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices moved lower in
Tokyo Monday as investors were disappointed with the Bank of
Japan's quarterly Tankan survey on business confidence.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 66.77 points, or 0.37
percent, from last Friday's close to end at 18,205.08 points.

<HEADLINE> China's Reunification, Firm Goal of Communist Party Leaders (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The scheduled resumption of the
exercise of sovereignty over Macao by the Chinese government on
December 20 means that the goal of the Communist Party of China (
CPC) leadership to reunify China is one major step closer to
fulfilment.
</P>
<P>
Ever since Mao Zedong (1893-1976) declared the founding of the
People's Republic of China (PRC) atop the Tiananmen Gate 50 years
ago, China's reunification has remained an unswerving goal for the
leadership of the CPC.
</P>
<P>
The government of new China has abolished all unequal treaties
that former Chinese governments had signed with foreign countries,
paving the way for the homecoming of Hong Kong and Macao. In the
meantime,the central government has tried hard to prevent the
separation of Taiwan from China. In 1955, the late Premier Zhou
Enlai announced that the central government would try to liberate
Taiwan through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
A major breakthrough was made in this regard in February 1972,
when the Sino-U.S. Joint Communique was signed, in which the U.S.
government said it had no objection to China's claim of
sovereignty over Taiwan Province.
</P>
<P>
In November 1972, the United Nations passed a resolution to
delete Hong Kong and Macao from the list of colonies, which laid a
solid foundation for the homecoming of the two pieces of Chinese
territory.
</P>
<P>
On January 1, 1979, the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress issued a letter to compatriots in Taiwan. Deng
Xiaoping, who headed the second-generation CPC leadership, called
the New Year's Day of 1979 "a special day," when reunification of
the motherland was put on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
In September 1982, Deng told visiting British prime minister
that the Chinese government would be forced to step down if it
were unable to resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> China's Reunification, Firm Goal of Communist Party Leaders (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Deng invented the concept of "one country, two systems" and
personally gave instructions when the Chinese government
negotiated with the British government on the settlement of the
Hong Kong question and with the Portuguese government on the
settlement of the Macao question. He also expressed views on the
drafting of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Jiang Zemin, at the core of the third
generation CPC leadership, has missed no opportunities in calling
for greater, unified efforts with compatriots in Hong Kong, Macao
and Taiwan to achieve the goal of China's reunification.
</P>
<P>
Since Hong Kong returned to its motherland on July 1, 1997, the
Chinese president has been twice in the region to hear opinions of
local residents. Jiang is also going to lead the Chinese
government delegation to attend the ceremony for Macao's handover
to China and celebrations to mark the homecoming of Macao.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of reunification, the CPC central leaderships of
three generations headed respectively by Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping
and Jiang Zemin have displayed their wisdom by adhering to
fundamental principles while adopting a flexible attitude.
</P>
<P>
Though capable of taking back Hong Kong and Macao shortly after
the founding of New China, the CPC leadership decided then not to
do so. Maintenance of the status quo, the central leadership
reasoned, was conducive to social stability in the two regions and
conducive to the establishment of ties by New China with the
outside world through them in the face of a U.S.-led embargo.
Facts have proved that it has been a successful strategy.
</P>
<P>
In 1963, the CPC leadership worked out a brand-new policy
toward Taiwan, allowing the Taiwan authorities to retain decision-
making powers on all internal matters except foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
In January 1982, Deng Xiaoping put forward, for the first time,
the concept of "one country, two systems" to allow the practicing
of capitalism in some special regions while the main body of China
adopts socialism. Since then, the cause of reunification has made
substantial progress.
</P>
<P>
On December 19, 1984, the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the
Hong Kong Question was inked. On April 4, 1987, a breakthrough was
made on the settlement of the Macao question when the Sino-
Portuguese Joint Declaration on the issue was signed. Shortly
afterwards, cross-Straits relations reached a turning-point on
November 2, 1987, when the Red Cross of Taiwan began to handle
mainland applicants for travelling to the other side of the Taiwan
Straits.

Since the beginning of the 1990s, the third-generation CPC
leadership has stepped up their effort to implement the "one
country, two systems" policy, and return of Hong Kong and Macao
entered a new period. The Basic Law of HKSAR and the Basic Law of
MSAR were adopted by the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress in 1990 and 1993 respectively.
</P>
<P>
The successful handover of Hong Kong, on July 1, 1997, has been
a good example for the upcoming return of Macao. The central
government has strictly adhered to its pledge of no interference
in the internal affairs of the HKSAR, under the principles of "one
country, two systems", "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and
"a high degree of autonomy" for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
To promote the establishment of ties across the Taiwan Straits,
the central government has taken a series of measures and policies
including the setting up of Association for Relations across the
Taiwan Straits on December 16, 1991 and the enactment of Law on
Protection of Investment by Taiwan Compatriots in January 1994.
Jiang Zemin, in an important speech he made in early 1995, raised
the well-known eight proposals on developing cross-Straits
relations and promoting China's reunification. He called for
negotiations to end hostilities and opening direct trade and
direct postal and transport services across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, cross-Straits relations have kept developing
despite disturbances from the other side of the Straits, mainly
from  Lee Teng-hui.
</P>
<P>
The third-generation CPC leadership is confident that,
following a smooth return of Hong Kong and Macao to their
motherland, the aspiration of the Chinese people to reunify their
country is bound to be fulfilled in the new century.

<P>
TOKYO, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chairman of the
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) Li Ruihuan said he is confident of Macao's
prosperity and stability after its return to China later this
month.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Japan Broadcasting Corp. (NHK) here
over the weekend, Li said that with the motherland's mighty
support added to its original characteristics and advantages,
Macao will bloom in new vigor and vitality and prosper in
stability following the return.
</P>
<P>
He noted that under the principle of "one country, two systems,
" the guidelines of "Macao people governing Macao" and a "high
degree of autonomy" were written in the Sino-Portuguese Joint
Declaration on the Question of Macao and the Basic Law of Macao.
</P>
<P>
Both documents explicitly maintain Macao's existing social and
economic system, its life style and general law structure to keep
its uniqueness, which, said Li, will contribute to the stability
and development of Macao, the reforms and modernization in the
mainland, as well as the eventual realization of China's
reunification.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is here on a nine-day good-will visit, cited Hong
Kong's dynamic status quo despite various doubts before its
handover to China in 1997.
</P>
<P>
He described Macao's return as another grand event in the
Chinese history and a new milestone in China's reunification
process.
</P>
<P>
For China and Portugal, the successful solution to the Macao
issue is bound to play a positive role in the long-term
development of bilateral relations, Li said.

MACAO, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Lotus Flower Bridge linking
Macao Peninsula with neighboring Zhuhai city in south China's
Guangdong province was inaugurated last Friday, opening a second
gateway to the Chinese mainland from Macao.
</P>
<P>
This 24-million US dollar project was only one of the large
number of infrastructure projects Macao has undertaken to improve
its investment environment over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
The 23.6-sq. km. region, which has been under the Portuguese
rule for more than 150 years, is to return to China on Dec. 20.
</P>
<P>
The Macao International Airport, which cost 1.2 billion US
dollars, is the biggest and most important project of all. The
airport with an annual handling capacity of six million passengers
now links Macao with Chinese mainland cities such as Beijing and
Shanghai, Taiwan region, Singapore, Bangkok, Seoul, Lisbon and
Brussels, and it has handled more than eight million arrivals and
departures since it was put into use in late 1995.
</P>
<P>
High-speed passenger liners, however, constitute the most
common transportation means for travelers between Macao and the
nearby Hong Kong. The New Ferry Terminal, which cost 100 million
US dollars, was built in 1993 and it may handle 30 million
passengers a year.
</P>
<P>
The 56-million US dollar Ka Ho Container Port, which was built
in 1994 at the Coloane Island, has played an important role in
boosting Macao's foreign trade and in regaining its former glory
as a commodities entrepot.

<HEADLINE> Nike to Sponsor Sydney Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Sporting goods manufacturer
Nike will provide uniforms for the Sydney Olympics and the
Australian Olympic and Paralympic teams until 2004 as part of its
new sponsorship deal with SOCOG and the Australian Olympic
Committee (AOC), officials said in Sydney on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Details of the new arrangements with Nike, which replaced a
deal with Reebok, were announced by New South Wales state Olympics
Minister Michael Knight and AOC President John Coates.
</P>
<P>
"We're very pleased to welcome Nike on board for 2002 (winter
Olympics) and 2004 (summer Games). It's important for us to be
satisfied that at this late stage Nike can deliver (for 2000),"
Coates said.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between the Sydney Organising Committee for the
Olympic Games (SOCOG) and Nike were only finalised at 3.00 a.m.
Sydney time at Nike headquarters in Portland, Oregon, the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Nike's involvement comes after Reebok pulled its Olympic
sponsorship last week because it was angry that some industry
rivals were providing sports clothing it believed were part of its
10-million-Australian dollar (6.6 million U.S. dollars) contract.
</P>
<P>
Reebok has launched a breach of contract motion against SOCOG,
which is to counter-sue Reebok in court.

To better preserve its environment, Macao built three sewage
treatment plants in 1995, 1997 and 1999, respectively, making
Macao one of the leaders in Asia in treating city sewage.
Meanwhile, an incineration plant was also completed in 1992 at a
cost of 67 million US dollars to deal with the city garbage.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, Macao has invested billions of US dollars in
building schools. A total of 26 new schools had been established
by March this year, with another ten expected to be completed by
the end of 2000. The Macao authorities also allocated 75 million
US dollars to renovate the Conde S. Januario Hospital, and 18
million US dollars to finance a new building in the Kiang Wu
Hospital.
</P>
<P>
The Nam Van Lakes Waterfront Development Plan, one of the most
ambitious development projects in Asia in the 1990s, is expected
to be completed in 2001 with a total investment of two billion US
dollars. Massive land reclamation project from the sea is expected
to expand the area of Macao by 20 percent upon completion of the
project.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Macao Cultural Center in the Outer Harbor of
Macao, built with a government investment of 100 million US

<HEADLINE> Yearender: Global Nuclear Disarmament Suffers Setback in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The past year has witnessed
setbacks in global nuclear disarmament, with the shadow of a new
arms race looming ahead.
</P>
<P>
New developments in hegemonism and power politics however have
also disrupted the positive trend in disarmament prompted by the
end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
Progress was made in nuclear disarmament, thanks to detente
after the Cold War ended. It raised hopes for a quicker pace in
the process. Among the results, the 1995 indefinite extension of
the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) and
the 1996 adoption of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty (
CTBT).
</P>
<P>
But last March, the United States led the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) into a 78-day air strike on Yugoslavia in
order to force Belgrade to give in on the issue of Kosovo, a
Yugoslav province where separatist-minded ethnic Albanians want
independence.
</P>
<P>
On the one hand, the war prompted countries to reassess their
nuclear policies and seek new and advanced weapons so as to obtain
military advantage for security concerns, which was expected to
bring nuclear disarmament to a standstill and spark a new arms
race.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, to the greatest concern of the international
community, NATO operations set a dangerous precedent by being
launched without a mandate from the United Nations Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
The NATO move, which ran counter to the U.N. Charter and
established norms governing international relations, was an
exercise of its new strategic concept that allows military
intervention for "humanitarian" reasons to extend beyond NATO
territory.
</P>
<P>
The concept echoes the U.S.-preached idea of "human rights over
sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
The theory, which they used to justify bypassing the U.N.
Security Council and using military interference with the internal
affairs of a sovereign state, has provoked intense criticism from
many countries, which thought it no other than a pretext for their
practice of power politics and hegemonism.
</P>
<P>
The NATO operation highlighted the need for military security
for these countries and added to their concerns caused by eastward
expansion of the Western military bloc.
</P>
<P>
A product of the East-West standoff during the Cold War era,
the defense alliance should have perished with the dissolution of
its adversary, the Warsaw Pact. But it continues, and moreover,
it is strengthening itself.
</P>
<P>
NATO completed the first stage of its expansion with the March
12 accession of Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic despite
strong protests from Russia.
</P>
<P>
Feeling threatened by the expansion and other Western moves,
Russia is attaching more importance to the issue of nuclear
weapons for security concerns.
</P>
<P>
As possessors of the world's largest nuclear arsenals, the U.S.
and Russia are obligated to do more in nuclear disarmament, and
pave the way for the start of a multilateral process. The
movement saw some progress after the Cold War ended, but it has
since this year been in a deadlock.
</P>
<P>
Last March, Washington made it a law to develop and deploy a
national missile defense system (NMD), though its demand for
amending the 1972 "Treaty on the Limitation of Anti-Ballistic
Missile Systems (ABM)" it signed with the then Soviet Union was
rejected by Moscow.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. project is in violation of the treaty designed to ban
such plans, with a view to maintaining balance between the two
largest nuclear powers. Nevertheless, Washington has announced an
additional spending of 6.6 billion U.S. dollars within the next
five years on the NMD.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Washington worked hard to push through its
controversial program of the theater missile defense system (TMD)
in Asia, and has obtained support from Japan. The U.S. program
has caused widespread concern across Asia. International
disarmament experts said it threatens to trigger off new arms
races in that region.
</P>
<P>
Russia said that the U.S. plan to amend the ABM is aimed at
winning strategic dominance, which will break the existing
strategic balance worldwide and undermine the groundwork for
nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the Russian State Duma continued shelving START II
-- a U.S.-Russia treaty on the second stage of reduction in their
offensive strategic arms, leaving little chance for the drafting
of START III.
</P>
<P>
In October, the global disarmament efforts suffered another
heavy blow when the U.S. Congress vetoed the CTBT, which is
designed to ban nuclear proliferation and the upgrading of nuclear
arms.
</P>
<P>
Consequence of the U.S. move is far-reaching. Above all, it
will postpone the entry into force of the treaty, which comes only
when ratified by all the world's 44 nuclear capable countries.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it will affect the stance of other countries on the
issue, making CTBT signatories hesitant to ratify it and those who
have not yet signed the treaty more reluctant to sign it.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the U.S. move has cast a shadow over the NPT
review conference next year. For years, many countries have
conditioned their approval of the treaty's extension upon the
progress in the disarmament process of nuclear powers. They did
not change the stand when the NPT got indefinitely extended.
</P>
<P>
In all, many events in 1999 have undermined the atmosphere and
the conditions needed in the nuclear nonproliferation and
disarmament process. Countries feel unsafe and don't want to go
further.
</P>
<P>
This may explain why member countries of the Conference on
Disarmament (CD), a Geneva-based regime for multilateral
disarmament talks, failed to strike an agenda for future
disarmament talks during the CD's 1999 plenary sessions.
</P>
<P>
The balance of strength between major powers and the global
strategic stability based on such a balance are a prerequisite for
nuclear disarmament. Once strategic balance and stability is
threatened, and confidence and the sense of security are
negatively affected, the process of nuclear disarmament will be
stalled, or will even be reversed. Global nuclear disarmament is
now at the crossroads, and the international community should make
it a priority to avert a gloomy prospect and work harder to
maintain world peace and security.

<HEADLINE> Report Says Lebanese at Risk From Pirate Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese patients are coming
under increasing risk as imitations of well-known brand drugs
enter the country in growing quantities, the Daily Star newspaper
Monday quoted a report as saying.
</P>
<P>
The report by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of
America says Lebanon is teetering between moving toward "safe,
quality" pharmaceutical sector and one that "may be overrun by
poor quality pirated copies."
</P>
<P>
Lebanon has one of the fastest growing and most promising
pharmaceutical sectors in the region but inadequate regulations,
lax law enforcement and insufficient resources are leaving the
country's medicine market open to low quality drugs and impeding
access to new medicines, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Imported drugs, accounting for at least 90 percent of the
market share, totaled 238.6 million U.S. dollars in retail value
in 1998, up 18 percent from that of 1997 and almost five times the
1991 figure.
</P>
<P>
Drugs import volume is expected to reach about 280 million
dollars this year, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Although pharmaceutical piracy is not yet rampant in Lebanon as
it is in Jordan and Syria, the problem is getting worse, the
report warned.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that local companies engaged in fake drugs
production, as well as those from Jordan, the United Arab Emirates
and Syria, are pressuring Lebanese health authorities to register
unauthorized copies of internationally patented pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
But Lebanon's Health Ministry denied the report's claims by
saying that pirated drugs and low-quality copies are "very rare"
here.

competitive edge. Local official said that in the first ten months
of this year, banks in the province provided 680 million yuan in
loans to the province's SOEs that are in the red.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Throat Cancer Patients Can Still Speak After Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Throat cancer patients are
still able to talk after having their throats removed because of a
new technology developed by medical experts led by two professors
at the No. 2 Hospital Affiliated with Harbin Medical Sciences
University.
</P>
<P>
Associate Professor Guo Huamin and Professor Jin Dejun
developed the technology two years ago, which can restore the
function of the epiglottis and throat by connecting the jugular
flap with the end of the tongue and trachea.
</P>
<P>
So far, 24 such patients in this hospital are speaking normally
after their operations, hospital officials said.
</P>
<P>
Clinical experiments have shown that the success rate for this
procedure is 100 percent, and patients can resume speaking a week
after the operation.
</P>
<P>
Medical experts note that this technology has many advantages
over the "voice button input", now used widely in foreign
countries, which causes patients pain and inconvenience as the
button have to be changed regularly.

KAMPALA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- More troops of the Uganda
People's Defense Forces (UPDF) have been flown to the western part
of the country to help fight rampaging Allied Democratic Forces
(ADF) rebels who staged four daring attacks there last week.
</P>
<P>
"We really sent some troops to Bundibugyo to fight the rebels
there," a senior defense official, who preferred to be unnamed,
told Xinhua Monday morning in a telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
But, the official would not give the exact number of the
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Some reports here said that the Ugandan government troops were
ferried in army helicopters from the northern district of Gulu,
where the fourth division is based.
</P>
<P>
The ADF rebels attacked a government prison, seven military
detachments, a police barracks and a passenger convoy last week.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 people, including both combatants and civilians,
were killed during the gun battle. The casualties on the rebel
side is not available.
</P>
<P>
UPDF Chief of Staff James Kazini described the recent surprise
rebel attacks as signs of a dying horse, saying that the
government troops are bombing the Rwenzori mountains, sanctuary to
the ADF rebels.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, who have been fighting the government since January
1996, reportedly sneaked into western Uganda on being repulsed by
UPDF soldiers in eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo.
</P>
<P>
Some security intelligence put the number of rebels at well
200.
</P>
<P>
Kazini told local residents not to be panic, saying that the
government is squeezing the rebels' space and they could be wiped
out very soon.

BEIJING, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Snow falling in Beijing today
has not affected domestic or international flights, but airport
officials say they are on alert for weather changes.
</P>
<P>
The officials said they had mobilized snow-sweeping vehicles
to clear the runways, and so far today, no flights have been
canceled.
</P>
<P>
Snow melted on the ground, but roofs and trees around the
capital have turned white.
</P>
<P>
This was Beijing's largest snow for this winter, and it has
made traffic police nervous, and extra patrols have been sent onto
the streets to maintain traffic order.
</P>
<P>
The snow began at about 9 o'clock this morning and lasted
until noon. The highways from Tianjin, Tangshan and other
neighboring cities remained open, and police have reminded drivers
to move at lower speeds.
</P>
<P>
Although most drivers have exercised greater caution, many
minor accidents have been reported, the police said.
</P>
<P>
Traffic departments have scattered chemicals on the ground to
prevent the snow from turning to ice.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural experts said that this snow is good for the
growth of crops, as it helps against drought.
</P>
<P>
Meteorologists say the snow was due to cold air currents out
of northeast China.

citric acid, by using a technique called industrial iron
chromatography liquid separation, has been successfully employed
in industrial production on a trial basis for one year in China,

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Angolan Govt. Wins Battle, Not yet War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Though the rebel leader Jonas Savimbi suffered a major defeat
in the government's all-out offensive in recent months, he did not
even consider surrendering after 25 years of civil war with the
government.
</P>
<P>
Savimbi's forces have turned into small groups of armed
bandits and are still active in the mountainous areas, which are
almost out of reach of the government forces. There are still
possibilities for the smashed rebels to build new bases in remote
areas or even in neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The government Army Chief of General Staff Joao de Matos said,
"the war is not over yet, our actions are continuing."
</P>
<P>
The government has reinforced its troops in the provinces
bordering with Zambia, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of the
Congo (DRC) to prevent the rebels from fleeing the country.
</P>
<P>
While enhancing military actions, the Angolan government has
strengthened diplomatic efforts to isolate UNITA.
</P>
<P>
Angola is urging Zambia to stop providing logistic support for
Savimbi troops, persuading Cote d'Ivoire to revoke Savimbi and his
followers passports and also asked help from the Zimbabwean troops
stationed in DRC to cut off the rebels retreat in neighboring DRC.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government has mended its ties with the regional
power South Africa by supporting the latter to play a leading role
in the Southern African Development Community (SADC). South Africa
has promised to abandon its support for the UNITA and implement
the UN sanctions against the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Since the government has got an upper hand in the battle field
from mid September, the United States has changed its attitude
toward Angolan civil war and thrown its weight behind the
government forces and agreed to tighten sanctions against UNITA.
</P>
<P>
U.S. ambassador to the war-torn country Joseph Sullivan said
recently, " peace in Angola can be expected soon."
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government has made progress in the battle field.
If the government can gain over-all support from the international
community, especially from its neighbors, peace and stability in
the poor country can be expected soon, but a total victory of the
government is still not in sight, observers believe.

trading of migratory birds living in Boyang Lake in a bid to
ensure the safety of wildlife which winters there at China's
largest freshwater lake.
</P>

<P>
Xinglongsha Island, located in coastal Jiangsu Province in east
China, covers nearly 2,670 hectares in Qidong City in the mouth of
the Yangtze at the East China Sea.
</P>
<P>
The maritime climate and abundant plants and wildlife like mud
snails, paddy bugs, lobworms, and eels, have made the island the
ideal destination for migratory birds coming from north China in
winter.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Qidong City has made Xinglongsha Island a wildlife
protection area, and it is now a haven of rare and precious
migrants like cygnets, red-crowned cranes, white, black and grey
storks, and white-headed cranes.
</P>
<P>
A survey done recently shows that 50 red-crowned cranes have
flocked to the island so far this year, a number representing one-
twentieth of the world's total, while over half of birds in
Jiangsu Province are now on the island.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The number of unemployed
workers in Thailand is declining in line with the recovering
economy this year, the Bangkok Post reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a latest review conducted by the Labor and
Social Welfare Ministry as saying the country's unemployment in
September dropped to 1.4 million people from a peak of 1.7 million
in May.
</P>
<P>
The country's unemployment rate reached a peak of 5.2 percent
out of a labor force of 32.7 million, much higher than the pre-
crisis level of 2 percent out of 29.9 million in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The review also shows that the number of employees applying to
join and pay into the social security program has been rising
steadily since March.
</P>
<P>
In December last year, the number of businesses in the social
security system was 93,000 with a total of 5.41 million people.
</P>
<P>
However, in October this year, the number of businesses had
risen to 98,000, with a total of 5.61 million employees.
</P>
<P>
Before the economic crisis, there were 6.3 million employees in
the system.
</P>
<P>
Mallika Kunnavatana, a senior expert of the ministry, was
quoted as saying the rising social security figures reflect an
economic recovery though the ministry is not sure if it would be
sustainable.
</P>
<P>
The ministry defines those aged 18 and over and actively
looking for jobs as unemployed.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Launches Immunization Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has launched its fifth-
year national immunization days (NID), giving polio vaccine Sunday
to children under five for the first day of this year's NID.
</P>
<P>
This year, the target is to cover 5.9 million children in the
country, according to Monday's official newspaper The New Light of
Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The second day of Myanmar's NID will be on January 16, 2000.
</P>
<P>
All basic health staff of the country's Ministry of Health was
mobilized for Sunday's NID activities.
</P>
<P>
The NID in Myanmar was also implemented with the assistance,
both technical and financial, from U.N. agencies, Rotary
International, Japan International Cooperation Agency, Japan
Committee "Vaccine for World's Children," the South Korean
government and Britain's Premier Petroleum Ltd.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Myanmar is also taking part in the global polio
eradication initiative together with other nations of the world.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's Expanded Program on Immunization, which is one of the
main activities in the country's national health plan for the
prevention of six major childhood diseases since 1978, is also
implementing its program as routine immunization as well as the
NID.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar plans to implement the NID for another year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Hardship Persists for Thai Agriculture Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The report by Thai Farmers Research Center, which is available
Monday, said the gloomy prospect may force the government to set
up a 60 billion baht (1.5 billion U.S. dollar) budget to stabilize
agriculture prices, mainly prices for rice and tapioca.
</P>
<P>
The report said commodity prices and export markets' demand
will continue to decline as the world's crop output increases.
</P>
<P>
This will reduce the purchasing power of 60 percent of the
local population, weaken domestic demand by 5 to 10 percent and
affect the country's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the budget, "survival" strategies will rely on
measures to upgrade productivity and international competitiveness
of both agricultural and agro-industrial goods in terms of quality,
value-added content and packaging, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand should promote its organic, pollution-free
agricultural products and find new distribution channels and
export markets for its farm goods, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The research center suggested that relevant state agencies
expedite fishing rights negotiations and settle disputes with
neighboring countries to support local seafood processing plants
and other related downstream industries.
</P>
<P>
It also proposed that the Bank of Agriculture and Agricultural
Cooperatives extend its services to cover cost reduction policies,
yield improvement projects and expansion of marketing
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The center also said state agencies should increase their
management efficiency.

Its Stamps Marketing Manager Wendy Riley said in an
announcement here Monday that the special Round Kiwi (a unique
bird in New Zealand) stamp will be released on December 31, 1999.
Then on January 1, 2000, the last stamp issue in New Zealand Post'
s millennium stamp series, "Year 2000: First to See the New Dawn,"
will be issued.

<P>
"The two stamp issues are designed to celebrate these two
special dates in our lifetime," she said.
</P>
<P>
Riley said the Round Kiwi stamp has become a favorite among
collectors and the wider public since the first olive green Round
Kiwi was introduced in 1988.
</P>
<P>
"Reissued over the past 11 years in red (1991), blue (1993) and
purple (1997), this special Round Kiwi stamp with its overprinted
sheet selvedges and gutter strip signals the end of the
availability of the purple Round Kiwi stamp valued at 1 New
Zealand dollar," she said.

The overprinting includes the New Zealand Post Stamps website
address in the gutter strip and simulates golden rays of the sun
on the selvedge of the 33mm diameter, circular stamps, she added.

<P>
The 40c "Year 2000: First to See the New Dawn" stamp, Riley
said, commemorates New Zealand being the first country in the
world to see the sun rise on the third millennium. It is also the
first New Zealand stamp to be micro-printed, she added.

According to the stamps marketing manager, the stamp features a
dawn sunrise with a map overlaid showing the arc of the rising sun
around the world and the time when the sun will rise on Mt. Hakepa
on Pitt Island in the Chathams Islands, the first inhabited place
on earth to see the new dawn.

<HEADLINE> Senior Chinese Economist Calls for Distribution Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, December 13 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese economist has
stressed the necessity of intensifying reform of the distribution
system while carrying forward the strategic reorganization of
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Gao Shangquan, director of the China Economic System Reform
Institute, made the call in a speech delivered recently to an
international forum on China's income distribution reform and
shareholding by workers. The forum was held on December 8 in
Haikou, the provincial capital of south China's Hainan Province.
</P>
<P>
China's economic reform is being carried out in a steady and
well-planned manner, and these efforts have seen notable
achievements, Gao said.
</P>
<P>
"But in the process of economic reform, contradictions stemming
from the distribution system are becoming increasingly intense,
and have, to some extent, affected economic growth and social
stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is essential to thoroughly understand and scientifically
analyze the current income distribution situation, institute
diversified income distribution measures, and creatively come up
with socialist distribution theories with Chinese characteristics,
Gao explained.
</P>
<P>
He noted that reforming of the distribution system by letting
workers hold certain portions of the stake is an urgent task for
implementing in-depth reform of the property rights system, and
for state-owned enterprises which are aiming at the construction
of market-aware operations as their objective.
</P>
<P>
The practice of workers holding a stake can help build a
property rights ligament between workers and their enterprises,
and is conducive to improving corporate rectifying structures and
attracting new investors.
</P>
<P>
Stake-holding on the part of workers can also provide new
guarantees for their old-age pensions.
</P>
<P>
More than 130 scholars and experts from the United States,
Britain, Germany, and Hungary and from across China attended the
forum.

<HEADLINE> Tourists Swarm into Pre-Return Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Macao's upcoming return to China,
due on December 20, has boosted local tourism industry once hit by
the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Tourists are now swarming into Macao for local attractions like
A-Ma Temple, ruins of the St. Paul's Church, and the venue for the
December 20 handover ceremony where workers are now giving
finishing touches, nearby buildings, and surrounding lawns and
supportive structures.
</P>
<P>

mostly from the inland areas of China.
</P>
<P>
Macao received a total of 637,098 tourists in October, compared

<HEADLINE>   Low Price Hits Cambodia's Rubber Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's rubber
production will drop by 8 percent this year to 35,000 tons because
of low rubber price in the markets.
</P>
<P>
According to industry officials, the rubber output of this year
will fall to 35,000 tons from about 40,000 tons last year and is
expected to remain at this year's level next year. Low prices have
forced some farmers to cut down their rubber trees to sell the
wood.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia has some 55,000 hectares of land under rubber trees,
including state plantations and small-holder plots. Cambodia's
rubber is exported to Singapore, Malaysia and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
However, the rubber price, affected by the Asian economic
crisis, which struck the region in mid-1997, dropped about 50
percent, from about 1,000 U.S. dollars per ton last year to about
450 U.S. dollars per ton this year, although it rallied last month,
according to some industry sources.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's rubber industry has suffered from years of conflict
and neglect as the country slipped into two decades of war. Rubber
covered 70,000 hectares of land and was the country's second
largest export after timber.
</P>
<P>
But now a quarter of Cambodia's rubber trees are more than 40
years old, well past their production prime. At the same time, the
theft and smuggling of latex from state-owned plantations also
affected the cultivation.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to privatize the state-owned plantations
to improve Cambodia's rubber to meet the buyer's needs and a
multimillion-dollar plan is under way in Kompong Cham to develop
small holdings with funding from a French development agency.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that demand for natural rubber will grow sharply
in the future.
</P>
<P>
The potential area for rubber cultivation in Cambodia is about
300,000 hectares which could produce more than 200,000 tons of dry
rubber a year, officials said.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Fails to Check Air Pollution by Vehicles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government has
failed to check black smoke emitting from vehicles because the
Environment Ministry was unable to get cooperation from other
ministries concerned in implementing its programs designed to
combat air pollution, The Economic Observer reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Environment Ministry adopted various programs during the
last two years in an effort to reduce pollutant particles from the
air in the capital city, but none of the programs could be
executed.
</P>
<P>
For example, the government decided to ban import of two-stroke
engines and slap a 200-percent tax on spares of the existing two-
strike engines, but under intense pressure from the business
community, the ban on import and the imposition of tax remained
wishful thinking, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Economic consideration prompted the business community to go
for two-stroke engines as environment-friendly four-stroke engines
were more costly and would consume more fuel, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
The city's Department of Environment installed a motor vehicle
inspection center in the city in June last year, following the
instruction of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, but the move failed
due to lack of adequate cooperation form law-enforcing agencies
and the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Around 100,000 two-stroke vehicles are running on the streets
of Dhaka and 90 percent of them are obsolete, the report added.
</P>
<P>
Air pollution in the Bangladeshi capital has reached a very
high level due to emission of suspended particulate materials by
vehicles at an increasing rate, according to a survey conducted by
the Department of Environment.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Set Up Central Silos for Paddy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 13 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to stem a sharp fall
in paddy prices, Thailand's rice-trader restructuring subcommittee
will seek a 3-billion-baht 77.9 million-U.S dollar) soft loan to
build up central silos nationwide, the Nation reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The plan is aimed at delaying rice production in the early
harvest season from entering the market, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The silos are targeted to store up to 1 million tons of rice
and paddy and the government is expected to provide technology to
maintain rice quality in barns, the Nation said.
</P>
<P>
Niphon Wongtra-ngan, president of the Public Warehouse
Organization, was quoted by the newspaper as saying the silos will
be constructed in main rice-growing provinces in the north and the
northeast.
</P>
<P>
Under the project, the government will provide soft loans for
construction to farmers by allowing them to borrow from commercial
banks and the government at different interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The project will allow farmers higher bargaining power with
rice traders as well as solving the problem of falling prices,
Niphon said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's total paddy production this year is predicted to
reach 18 million tons, one-third of which will be for export.
</P>
<P>
Currently, 100 percent white fragrant rice is trading at about
560 dollars a ton and 100 percent white rice at 290 dollars a ton.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that farmers will continue to face falling
prices for another year due to oversupply in the world market.

<HEADLINE> Macao SAR to Ensure Freedom of Financial Markets (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 13 (Xinhua) -- After Macao's return to China
on December 20, the Special Administrative Regional (SAR)
government shall adopt a policy of less intervention to ensure the
free operations of the local financial market and the various
financial institutions while administrating and supervising them
according to law for the sake of the development of the local
financial industry.
</P>
<P>
This was assured recently by officials of the upcoming Macao
SAR government.
</P>
<P>
Herculano J. Sousa, general manager of the Macao Branch of the
Banco Nacional Ultramarino, a Portuguese bank issuing Macao
currency, pataca, also said that Macao's financial sector is quite
optimistic about the development of local financial industry after
its return. He expressed the belief that free operations of
Macao's financial market will continue to be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
To maintain a high degree of autonomy of the Macao SAR and
promote its economic development after its return, the government
of the SAR shall, according to the Basic Law of the Macao SAR,
formulate its laws and policies to manage its own financial
affairs and currency, free of any intervention from the Central
People's Government.
</P>
<P>
It is stipulated in the Basic Law that the Macao pataca, as the
legal tender in the Macao SAR, shall continue to circulate. The
SAR government may authorize designated banks to perform or
continue to perform the function of its agents in the issuance of
the Macao currency.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law also stipulates that the issuance of Macao
currency pataca must be backed by a 100 percent reserve fund, that
no foreign exchange control policies shall be imposed in the SAR,
that the Macao pataca shall be freely convertible, and that the
SAR government shall protect its circulation and the free flow in
and out of the region.
</P>
<P>
The financial institutions in Macao have a history of nearly
100 years. At first, local Chinese set up money lockers or mini-
banks, whose main business was financing, trust funds, money
change and transfer of accounts. With a large influx of overseas
Chinese from southeast Asian nations into Macao around the 1960s,
the real estate business, handicraft industry and other local
industries have developed, and this has given an impetus to the
financial business, the savings deposits and loans in particular,
and consequently, a number of banks were set up during the period.

<P>
The financial system in Macao is mainly composed of banks and
non-banking financial institutions which mainly refer to insurance
companies and investment companies mainly engaged in financial
services such as buying and selling of stocks, foreign exchange,
gold and bills of other places.
</P>
<P>
A number of currencies are used in Macao's financial system,
but mainly the Macao pataca and Hong Kong dollar with a few other
currencies of small denominations.
</P>
<P>
Macao has no foreign exchange control, its residents may
directly go to banks or money change shops to buy foreign
currencies with the Macao pataca. This has facilitated the
development of foreign exchange business in Macao to some extent.
</P>
<P>
At present, the highest financial authority in Macao is the
Monetary and Cambial Authority of Macao, and it plays the role of
a central bank, including monitoring and supervising the financial
industry, and assisting the government in formulating and
implementing relevant policies. However, it is not a money-issuing
institution in its real sense, it does not have the function of
issuing treasury bonds and assisting the government in raising
money. This institution should not be regarded as the central bank
of Macao, it is a quasi-central bank of the region.
</P>
<P>
There are now 20 banks with official licenses in Macao, and
most of the savings deposits of local residents are concentrated
in a few Chinese-funded banks. A small number of Portuguese-funded
banks or well-known foreign banks also have a sizeable amount of
deposit business. The savings deposits in Hong Kong dollars by
Macao residents have been kept stable, at around 50 percent, and
the interest rates fluctuate with the international financial
market.
</P>
<P>
The insurance market in Macao is mainly operated by insurance
companies that are doing life insurance and non-life insurance
businesses, and at present, 21 insurance companies are permitted
to do insurance business in Macao, among them, four are
specialized in life insurance business and others in non-life
insurance businesses.
</P>
<P>
Following Macao's return, the Macao residents, including its
residents residing overseas, are still free to do such businesses

<HEADLINE> Foreign Airlines in Indonesia Reschedule New Year's Eve Flights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Several foreign airlines
operating in Indonesia have rescheduled or canceled their flights
to and from or within the country on New Year's Eve due to
concerns over the possible impact of a Y2K computer glitch.
</P>
<P>
Japan Airlines' sales manager for Indonesia Shuichi Sakamoto
said the carrier would reschedule its Jakarta services, which
depart just before midnight, in line with the airline's policy not
to fly in the midnight hours of December 31 for safety operation
reasons.
</P>
<P>
"Despite our readiness regarding Y2K problems, we should keep
safe operations. The departure time for flights on December 31 to
Tokyo and Osaka will be delayed until the early hours of January 1,
" he was quoted by the Jakarta Post Monday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Japan Airlines flies daily from Jakarta to Tokyo and Osaka.
</P>
<P>
Y2K problems refer to those computerized systems could face at
the turn of the century, when their two-digit year counters fail
to distinguish between 1900 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
The glitch may cause computers to shut down or fail to function
properly. Power supplies may falter, telephones and transportation
systems may stop operating and automated banking transactions may
fail.
</P>
<P>
EVA Air said it would fly as usual to Taipei from Jakarta or
Denpasar on New Year's Eve but would suspend its connecting
flights between Denpasar and Surabaya as a precautionary measure.
</P>
<P>
EVA Air's Jakarta branch assistant manager for the passenger
section Diana Mawarsari said: "We decided to suspend the flights
because we are not sure about the Y2K preparedness at the
respective airports."
</P>
<P>
Some foreign airlines also decided to reschedule or cancel
their Jakarta service for the turn of the century, but attributed
their policies mainly to a lack of adequate seat demand, not the
Y2K dreads.
</P>
<P>
Australian carrier Qantas will reschedule its flight from
Sydney to Jakarta en route to Singapore on December 31.
</P>
<P>
Claire Hatton, the Indonesian manager for Qantas and British
Airways, said the flight would return to Sydney straight from
Singapore without stopping in Jakarta on the way back as it did on
the departure.
</P>
<P>
KLM Royal Dutch Airlines has decided to cancel its flights
departing from and arriving in Jakarta on December 31 and January
1 because of low demand for the flights.
</P>
<P>
Royal Brunei is considering canceling its flights departing
from Jakarta and Surabaya to Bandar Seri Begawan on December 31
due to low demand.

<HEADLINE> Macao Ready for Handover-Related Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Macao's security,
telecommunications, fire prevention and power supply departments
have taken up measures to ensure the smooth running of the major
handover-related activities, the handover and swearing-in
ceremonies in particular.
</P>
<P>
The Macao security departments will send some 3,700 policemen
and 400 marine and customs policemen to tighten up on security
during the handover period.
</P>
<P>
Security restrictions will be imposed on certain road sections
from 7:00 a.m. December 13 to 1:00 p.m. December 20. Commercial
activities in the security zones are required to suspend from 2:00
p.m. December 18 to the midnight of December 20.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of this month, the Fire Brigade sent its staff
and fire engines to stand on the around-the-clock duty at two main
venues for handover-related activities, according to a spokesman
of the Macao Fire Brigade.
</P>
<P>
A general test will be conducted over fire prevention
facilities equipped at the handover venues before December 20, the
spokesman said, adding that its 700-plus staff members will all be
on duty on December 19-20.
</P>
<P>
The Macao Telecommunications Company has sent all of its staff
to serve the press and the security forces working for the
handover. The company has expanded the telecommunications network,
installed some 2,000 telephones and seven satellite ground
stations, and set up a service center at the press center to
provide 24-hour services for the press.
</P>
<P>
The company will also cooperate with the China Telecom network
to broadcast live the handover ceremony on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Macao's electricity supply company has made up insurance
packages and pledged normal power supply at the handover venues.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Revenue Collection Short of Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government
collected 54.3 billion taka (1.06 billion U.S. dollars) of revenue
between July and November 1999, the first five months of the
current 1999-2000 fiscal year, 11.7 percent short of the original
target of 61.54 billion taka (1.21 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The shortfall during the five-month period would rise to 11.35
billion taka (222.5 million dollars) if it was calculated on the
basis of the revised target fixed by the Finance Ministry, The
Independent daily newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The figure, however, represented a rise of 1.46 percent over
that of the corresponding period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The shortfall might increase in the coming months as the abrupt
" devaluation late last month of the local currency by 3 percent
would discourage import, the report said, adding that a stagnant
situation in imports, inadequate local production and smuggling of
Indian goods into the country were all factors that affected
revenue collection.
</P>
<P>
Items for infrastructure for the electricity and gas sector,
raw materials and machinery for export-oriented industries, which
constituted the majority of import goods, were being imported duty-
free, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Quoting official sources, the report said 31.66 billion taka (
620.8 million dollars) was collected as import duty from July to
November against the target of 37.96 billion taka (744.3 million
dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government collected 148.37 billion taka (2.91
billion dollars) of revenue in the 1998-1999 fiscal year, 5.5
percent short of the original target of 157 billion taka (3.08
billion dollars).

<P>
WUHAN, December 13 (Xinhua) -- China has rounded up an expert
team to start a comprehensive "health check" on the main
embankments of the Yangtze, China's longest river, which aims to
provide scientific data for reinforcing them.
</P>
<P>
A team of over 3,000 perambulators and hydrologists from the
Yangtze River Water Resources Committee (YWRC) have been deployed.
They are equipped with high-technology devices such as global
positioning systems and laser range finders.
</P>
<P>
Li Antian, director of YWRC, said that the team of experts was
divided into two groups. One group will focus on the hydrologics
and the other will provide accurate data for calculating the
amount of earthwork materials to be used in dyke reinforcement.
</P>
<P>
More than 200 drilling machines will be used for measuring the
thickness of the main embankments in different sections.
</P>
<P>
The team will be doing research in four provinces including
Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi and Anhui along the middle and lower reaches
of the river, which are most affected by floods.
</P>
<P>
Billions of yuan will be spent for anti-seeping repairs and
foundation reinforcement of the main embankments. YWRC has been
given the task of designing the project and keeping checks on
quality control.

<HEADLINE> Bulgarian Customs Seize 5 Kilos of Heroin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian customs officers
seized 5.17 kilograms of heroin at a checkpoint in Gyueshevo along
the border with Macedonia on Saturday night, the Bulgarian
Telegraph Agency (BTA) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted the press service of the General Customs
Directorate as saying that the drug was seized from a Bulgarian-
registered Audi 80, driven by a foreign national holding a
passport of temporary residence in Bulgaria, and heading towards
Kosovo via Macedonia.
</P>
<P>
Customs officers of the special drug control unit, who were
suspicious of the driver's frequent journeys abroad, diverted the
car for detailed examination which lasted for about five hours
till Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
The customs officers discovered the drug in a special
compartment built in the car's petrol tank.
</P>
<P>
On-field analysis showed the drug, packed in 10 packages, was
heroin.
</P>
<P>
The driver has been detained and the case was being
investigated, the BTA said.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian customs officers have foiled 30 drug trafficking
attempts since the beginning of this year, which involved the

<HEADLINE> Esophagus Cancer Incidence Reduced Linzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, December 13 (Xinhua) -- The incidence of esophagus
cancer has been reduced by about 25 percent in the city of Linzhou
in north China's Henan Province thanks to 40 years of efforts by
Chinese medical researchers.
</P>
<P>
With a population of nearly one million, Linzhou's esophagus
cancer rate had long been among the highest in the world, causing
grave concern to the central and provincial governments.
</P>
<P>
In 1959, the central government sent medical researchers to the
area to look for ways of curing and preventing this deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
The medical team spent several years trying to discover the
reason for the high rate of this particular type of cancer in the
city, and found that water and food in the area had a high content
of nitrosamine, a major carcinogenic
</P>
<P>
They also found that local people had the habit of eating hot
food, and preserved vegetables was another reason for the high
incidence of esophagus cancer.
</P>
<P>
So they campaigned for clean water and nutritious food such as
fresh vegetables, fruits and bean curd and brought down the rate
of esophagus cancer in the area.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang Ruilin, professor in charge of the Henan
Cancer Prevention Association, local medical researchers are also
making progress in treating other fatal cancers, with cures
reaching as high as 60 percent. They say that timely surgical
operations can bring the cure rate to as high as 90.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Some 300,000 people die of esophagus cancer every year
worldwide, 150,000 of them in China.

<HEADLINE> Sunken Warships with Treasures in South China Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists are
searching for the exact location of sunken warships in a sea
battle which took place 700 years ago near the mouth of the
Zhujiang River in south China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
 The "Yamen Sea Battle" broke out in early 1279, the last year
of the Southern Song Dynasty (1127-1279), and,according to
historical records, almost all the Song warships sank during the
battle.
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago, Chinese archaeologists have found two tons
of coins of the Song Dynasty in the area and they believe the
sunken warships they are searching for this time might contain
precious relics because the last emperor of the Song Dynasty and
many senior officials were on the ships when the sea battle took
place. The exact location of the sunken warships however remains
unknown.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Preparatory Committee for Macao SAR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 13 (Xinhua) -- Set up on May 5, 1998, the
Preparatory Committee for the Macao Special Administrative Region
(SAR) is an institution under the National People's Congress (NPC)
with the task of making preparations for the establishment of the
Macao SAR on December 20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
China will resume the exercise of sovereignty over Macao on
December 20.
</P>
<P>
According to an NPC Decision on the Method for the Formation of
the First Government, the First Legislative Council and the First
Judiciary of the Macao SAR, the Preparatory Committee is
responsible for making preparations for the establishment of the
Macao SAR and stipulates the specific methods for the
establishment of the first government, Legislative Council and
judiciary of the SAR.
</P>
<P>
According to the NPC decision, the Preparatory Committee shall
consist of both members from the Chinese mainland and members from
Macao. Members from Macao shall account for no less than 50
percent of the total members of the committee. The chairman and
vice-chairmen of the committee shall be appointed by the NPC
Standing Committee.
</P>
<P>
The Preparatory Committee is both an organ of power and a
working institution. It has four work groups, namely, the
political affairs, legal, economic, and social and cultural groups.
</P>
<P>
With the approval of the Ninth NPC Standing Committee, the
Preparatory Committee consists of 100 members, including 60 from
Macao and 40 from the Chinese mainland. The Macao members are from
a wide range of sectors such as the industrial, business,
professional (educational, legal and cultural), labor, social
service, religious and political circles. The Chinese mainland
members are mainly experts, scholars and leading officials of the
central and local departments which have close ties with Macao
affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Preparatory Committee has one chairman and nine vice-
chairmen. Among the vice-chairmen, four are from the Chinese
mainland and five from Macao. The Preparatory Committee has one
secretary-general and three deputy secretary-generals. Two of the
deputy secretary-generals are from the Chinese mainland, and the
third from Macao.
</P>
<P>
Since it was established, the Preparatory Committee has been
working under the two major principles of reflecting national
sovereignty and ensuring smooth transition of Macao.
</P>
<P>
The committee has basically accomplished such tasks as working
out the specific methods of preparing establishing the first
government of the Macao SAR, selecting the first chief executive,
setting up the first Legislative Council and the judiciary, and
working out the plans for the ceremony for the establishment of
the Macao SAR government and other celebration activities.
</P>
<P>
The committee also has put forward methods, major measures and
policy proposals about the legal, economic, social and cultural
issues with regard to the smooth transition of Macao.
</P>
<P>
It also has handled other important issues related to the
preparatory work.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Military Denies Blockade of Montenegro's Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, December 12 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav military on
Sunday firmly denied reports that it had closed the Tivat airport
in Montenegro, a secessionist-minded republic of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued at the Montenegro capital of Podgorica,
Yugoslavia's Navy Command said the information disseminated by
some media was purely fabricated since Yugoslav troops did not
conduct maneuvers or other activities recently in or near the
airport.
</P>
<P>
The reports said Montenegrin leaders were trying to take over
the control of the airport from the federal government in recent
days, leading to the blockade of the facility by the Yugoslav
troops.
</P>
<P>
The above reports were also denied Sunday by the manager of the
Tivat airport, Nikola Messtrovich, who stressed in a statement
that the airport has been in normal operation at all times.
</P>
<P>
Rows have intensified over relations between Montenegrin
authorities and the federal government since the March-June NATO
bombing of Yugoslavia. Montenegrin leaders, who were not
recognized by the federal government, sided with the West in the
campaign.

<HEADLINE> Macao: Return Brightens Economic Prospects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 13 (Xinhua) -- For Macao, return to the embrace
of its motherland is expected to brighten economic prospects
thanks to accelerated post-return exchanges between the region and
the rest of China in economic, trade, technology and other fields,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
Though Macao was one of the economically fastest-growing
regions in the world in the 1980s, its economic growth has slowed
down in the 1990s since its four pillar industries of tourism and
gambling, export-processing, finance and real estate are
vulnerable to external influences.The recent Asian financial
crisis has had a negative impact on the local economy, and so have
its internal problems in economic structure and public security.
</P>
<P>
In visualizing local economic prospects, economists refer to
Macao's numerous advantages: Macao's status as a free port,
enabling it to serve as a way station for Taiwan businesses with
investment in the Chinese mainland; Macao's geographical proximity
to Hong Kong and the Pearl River Delta, one of China's economic
powerhouses; the unique role it plays as a trade and cultural link
for the Chinese mainland and the West; its legally-run gaming
industry; and special tariff treatment it receives from Western
trade partners.
</P>
<P>
Recently-completed infrastructure projects such a deep-water
dock, an international airport, the Friendship Bridge and the
Lotus Bridge have improved the region's investment climate. More
such projects are under construction, including an ocean park and
a sightseeing tower.
</P>
<P>
Macao will face both opportunities and challenges after its
return to China, but opportunities are expected to outweigh
challenges, according to An Min, an aid to China's minister of
foreign trade and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In the first place, an improving external environment is
expected to speed up Macao's development: economies impacted by
the Asian financial crisis are recovering and Hong Kong is also
enjoying healthier economic growth than expected.
</P>
<P>
The strongest support for Macao comes from the mainland, where
reform of state enterprises is going in depth and the economy is
healthy and expanding. China's impending entry into the World
Trade Organization will also bring Macao more opportunities.
</P>
<P>
The future Macao Special Administrative Region Government, led
by chief executive designate Edmund Ho Hau Wah,is expected to map
out a new blueprint to better guide the region's economic
development.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese mainland, Hong Kong and Macao are expected to
become more active in exchanges after Macao returns to China,
making it possible for Macao to better develop itself by relying
on the other two parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Introduction of technologies from the mainland to Macao is
expected to receive a boost after Macao's return to its motherland;
and mainland enterprises, research institutes, and institutions of
higher learning may also set up branches or businesses in Macao, a
free port, where they are likely to find it easier to raise funds
and do trade.
</P>
<P>
Economists point out that, with an improving external
environment and active support from the mainland, and with Macao's
return to its motherland inspiring greater patriotism and work
enthusiasm among the local people, Macao is assured of a better
future.

<HEADLINE> Macao-HK Helicopter Flights Witness Expanding Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The helicopter ride, priced at 1,200-1,400 HK dollars per
ticket, is quite expensive compared with a ship voyage that costs
only one tenth of the helicopter flight price. However, it has
attracted many wealthy holiday-makers and gamblers from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Since the Hong Kong-based East Asia Airlines Limited (EAA)
began the helicopter flights between Macao and Hong Kong in 1990,
its business has kept growing. In the first 11 months of this year,
the EAA Helicopter transported an average of about 7,000
passengers per month.
</P>
<P>
According to Thomas Kei, a sales executive of the EAA
Helicopter, his company now has three S76c+ helicopters made by
the U.S. helicopter manufacturer Sikorsky, each with 12 passenger
seats.
</P>
<P>
The EAA Helicopter has hired experienced pilots who have an
average flight experience of 7,000 hours.

<HEADLINE> 3 Killed, 24 Injured in Strong Quake in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, December 13 (Xinhua) -- At least three people were
killed and 24 others injured during a powerful earthquake that
shook Luzon island in the northern Philippines before dawn Sunday,
reports reaching here Monday said.
</P>
<P>
Press Secretary Rodolfo Reyes said Philippine President Joseph
Estrada was closely monitoring the effects of the tremor and
ordered all local government units to provide immediate assistance
to the victims.
</P>
<P>
The tremor, with its epicenter in Lingayen, Pangasinan Province,
had a magnitude of 6.8 on the open-ended Richter scale, the
Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology (Philvolcs)
said.
</P>
<P>
At least 15 after-shocks were recorded on Sunday, with the
strongest measuring 5.5 on the Richter scale with its epicenter in
a location 87 kilometers northwest of Lingayen,Pangasinan,
Philvolcs said.
</P>
<P>
The National Disaster Coordinating Council (NDCC) said an 11-
year-old girl was killed by falling concrete while sleeping in her
house in northern Zambales Province.
</P>
<P>
A patient at a Manila hospital died of a heart attack at the
height of the tremor and a 60-year-old woman, from Pangasinan
Province, died from shock.
</P>
<P>
Most of the victims were from Zambales Province, where many
private and government buildings collapsed.
</P>
<P>
Power was knocked out but restored hours later in parts of
Manila and several provinces of Luzon, the country's largest
island with 40 million people.
</P>
<P>
The quake sank part of the reclaimed area of the Cultural
Center of the Philippine complex and inflicted minor damage on
buildings in Manila.
</P>
<P>
Public structures which have sustained minor damage also
include the central block building of the Philippine General
Hospital in Manila, the municipal halls of Sta Cruz and Masinloc
towns in Zambales and the Balubanon Bridge in Zambales.
</P>
<P>
Philvolcs chief Raymundo Punongbayan said damage was relatively
light because the focus of the earthquake was offshore and 60
kilometers deep.
</P>
<P>
The Philvolcs said the quake was caused by a movement of the
Manila trench, which runs along the western side of the Philippine
archipelago, adding that damage and more aftershocks are expected.
</P>
<P>
The NDCC said it has dispatched a team of structural engineers
to inspect and assess the damage on major public infrastructures.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines is in the Pacific "Ring of Fire" where
earthquakes frequently occur. About 2,000 people were killed when
a quake with a magnitude of 7.7 rocked the northern Philippines on
July 16,1990.

<HEADLINE> Romanian President Threatens to Sack Prime Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu held talks with the leaders of the ruling coalition
Sunday evening to discuss the possible sacking of Prime Minister
Radu Vasile, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu launched a stinging attack on Vasile in a live
televised address to the nation Sunday evening in which he
commented on Romania's newly won European Union candidate status.
</P>
<P>
The president said Romania's accession to the EU depends wholly
on the development of the east European nation. To join the EU,
Romania must pinpoint its priorities and draw up a five-year plan
now, he said.
</P>
<P>
Accordingly, the Romanian government must be led by a prime
minister who can put into place the five-year plan, said the
president.
</P>
<P>
"The ministers did their job well ... but what was lacking, and
things cannot continue any longer that way, was the absence of any
coordination of these efforts."
</P>
<P>
He asked the political parties in the ruling coalition to go
beyond partisan interests to work together for the sake of
national interests.

<HEADLINE> Silent Film of World War II Battle Discovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, December 13 (Xinhua) -- A silent film detailing a
major battle between the Japanese intruding troops and troops of
the former Soviet Union in northeast China during the early phase
of the World War II has been discovered by a Chinese movie
director.
</P>
<P>
The black-and-white silent film is un-edited and approximately
20 minutes long. Experts confirmed after a careful examination
that it was a record of the fierce battle between the troops of
the former Soviet Union and Japan at Zhanggufeng, near the Sino-
Russian border in northeast China's Jilin province, in late July
and early August in 1939.
</P>
<P>
Japan attempted to attack and intruded into the former Soviet
Union by way of northeast China in 1938. In July of that year,
both sides deployed divisions on the battlefield at Zhanggufeng.
</P>
<P>
The battle that lasted some 20 days took a total of 2,277 lives.
The troops of the former Soviet Union finally won the battle,
thanks to its twice greater supply of combat troops and deployment
of its dozen airplanes to carry out intense bombing.
</P>
<P>
The film records the stages of the battle with a focus placed
on the victory of the Soviet troops. The battlefield, Japanese
trenches, blockades and aircraft of Russian troops, as well as the
fleeing of Japanese soldiers after defeat are all included in the
footage.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that judging from the content, the film was shot
by a cameraman of the former Soviet troops and portion of it was
done from an aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The film was discovered by a movie director at a movie studio
in the city of Changchun, capital of northeast China's Jilin
province. The local Bureau of Radio and Television plans to
produce the film.

<HEADLINE> Frolander, Sjoberg Help Sweden for Most Golds at Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LISBON, December 12 (Xinhua) -- Lars Frolander and Johanna
Sjoberg helped Sweden for 10 most gold medals of the European
short-course championships which ended on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Two further victories in the concluding women's and men's 4x50
medley relays took Sweden's title tally twice as many Germany and
Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's Jana Klochkova completed a rare quartet of gold
medals, adding the women's 200 meters individual medley crown to
the 400 individual medley, 800 freestyle and 400 freestyle she had
won in the preceding days.
</P>
<P>
Frolander, double world short-course champion allowed Dutchman
Pieter van den Hoogenband to race into an early lead in the 100m
freestyle and take his European title.
</P>
<P>
Van den Hoogenband, silver medallist behind Frolander at the
last edition of these championships, surged through to win in 47.
20 seconds and add the 100 title to the 200 freestyle crown he
retained on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Frolander, winner of Friday's 100 metres butterfly, had to
settle for the freestyle silver in 47.86 but he sprinted to shared
gold medals in the 50 meters butterfly with defending champion
Milos Milosevic of Croatia and then picked up a final gold
swimming the butterfly leg in Sweden's victorious 4x50 meters
medley relay.
</P>
<P>
Sjoberg, silver medallist in the 50 and 200 meters butterfly
here, reclaimed the 100 butterfly title she won at the inaugural
European short-course championships in 1996. She sprinted away
from her rivals and won by more than a second from Danes Mette
Jacobsen and Sophia Skou in 57.73 seconds -- 0.01 of a second
outside the European record of Martina Moravcova from Slovakia was
just squeezed out of Sunday's 200 individual medley gold by
Klochkova.
</P>
<P>
But she bowed out on a winning note in the 200 freestyle
final by overhauling Sweden's Josefin Lillehage going into the
last turn and repeating her victory of 1998.
</P>
<P>
Therese Alshammar, who had cracked the six-year-old world
marks of China's Le Jingyi in the 50 and 100 meters freestyle,
collected her fourth gold and shared her second Swedish relay
world best of the meeting in the 4x50 medley.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish quartet of Therese Alshammar, Emma Igelstrom,
Johanna Sjoberg and Anna-Karin Kammerling clocked one minute 49.47
seconds in the rarely-swum event to beat the mark of 1:50.13 set
by Germany last December.
</P>
<P>
German Joerg Hoffmann swam a bold race in the 1,500 meters
freestyle but was caught by Igor Chervynskiy halfway through the
60-length marathon and had to yield the gold by 3.66 seconds to
the 18-year-old Ukrainian.
</P>
<P>
European long-course champion Stephan Perrot just missed a
world record in the men's 200 meters breaststroke by finishing 0.
03 outside the mark of Russia's Andrei Korneyev in 2:07.82.
</P>
<P>
He claimed France's only medal of the championships.
</P>
<P>
Iceland's Orn Arnarson collected his second backstroke gold in
the 100 event. Belgium's Brigitte Becue took the women's 100
breaststroke while Germany's Antje Buschschulte won the women's
200 backstroke.
